federica mogherini is the high representative of the european union for foreign affairs and security policy and vice-president of the european commission , so it is related to europe . 
   in the euro area , close to three-quarters of respondents support the euro ( 73 % , +3 points ) , which is the highest score reached since autumn 2004 . 
  [ breakdown by country ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/dgoj8zyumaamcu1.jpg:large ) . 
  there are also other optimistic developments to see :  trust in the eu continues to be on the rise and stands at 42 % ( up from 36 % in autumn 2016 and 32 % in autumn 2015 ) . 
  it has increased most strongly in france ( 41 % , +15 points ) , in denmark ( 56 % , +11 points ) and in estonia ( 55 % , +11 points ) . 
  it has also increased by 10 points in germany , reaching 47 % . 
  which is why the bundesbank wants a stronger euro ? 
  how is an undervalued pound better than an overvalued pound ? 
  i did n't mean to say that it did n't depreciate , but that it depreciated too much . 
  fits perfectly :  first the pound would be fine , and then it fell but would recover soon , and now a low pound is a good thing . 
  you 're just adapting to the facts yourself author . 
  strange , according to this bloomberg article the pound is undervalued https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-31/six-months-on-grossly-undervalued-euro-has-work-to-do, 
  ** feature : ** 10th anniversary of economic and monetary union ** description : ** the coin shows a stick figure which merges into the $ symbol . 
  it seeks to convey the idea of the single currency and , by extension , economic and monetary union ( emu ) being the latest step in europe 's long history of trade and economic integration . 
  the coin is issued by each euro area country and shows the name of the country as well as the legend ` emu 1999-2009 ' in the respective language ( s ) . 
  the design was chosen out of a shortlist of five by members of the public across the european union voting online . 
  it was created by george stamatopoulos , a sculptor from the minting department at the bank of greece . 
  the coin 's outer ring bears the 12 stars of the european union . 
  yes it 's apparently from a speech in 2010 . 
  nonetheless things like this tend to send a ( negative ) signal to the other side of the negotiation . 
  i 'm really losing hope for a `` mutually beneficial '' brexit with every passing week . 
  things like this & the withdrawal from the `` fishing pact '' just keep piling up . 
  this is literally a video of him saying `` i think ukip and the better off out campaign lack ambition . 
  i think the european union needs to be wholly torn down . '' i agree that the independent is usually clickbait , but even in context that 's a pretty damning quote for somebody who is supposed to negotiate the exit from the eu . 
  this guy was supposed to give a 10 minute speech . 
  they decided to cut him off after over 20 minutes . 
  i see no childish behavior from the organizer 's side here . 
  do n't know how accurate this is . 
  destatis ( federal statistical office of germany ) has the population of germany at 82,18 million as of 31.12.2015 . 
  and if you think about it , it does n't really make sense that germany `` lost '' over a million people in this time when there were a lot of refugees . 
  well uk had [ gdp growth of 0,2 % in q1 . 
  ] ( https://tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/gdp-growth ) italy on the other hand [ had 0,4 % in q1 ] ( https://tradingeconomics.com/italy/gdp-growth ) , so they actually performed better . 
  but it also seems that q1 is where uk typically has their weakest growth ( 2015 : 0,3 % ; 2016 : 0,2 % ) , so the article is a bit sensationalist - as is to be expected from the independent . 
  [ directly from the bundesagentur f\u00fcr arbeit ] ( https://statistik.arbeitsagentur.de/navigation/statistik/statistik-nach-themen/beschaeftigung/beschaeftigung-nav.html ), 
  [ not really though ] ( https://statistik.arbeitsagentur.de/cae/servlet/contentblob/13206/normal/842487/sozialversicherungspflichtig-beschaeftigte-deutschland.gif;jsessionid=cf6daa4f8a3611a05b542f5ef2db976a ), 
  i think you are confusing gdp with gdp per capita . 
  gdp figures are : * italy : 1.815 trillion usd ( 2015 ) * slovenia : 42.75 billion usd ( 2015 ) slovenia is not overtaking italy anytime soon in gdp . 
  another really interesting article from jeremy cliffe , i recommend reading it . 
  if its to long for you , there is a list with the most `` striking points '' . 
   ** economist : ** * do you think it 's incumbent on western countries , germany and others , to try and reset the situation in ukraine ? 
  canada is pushing for another revision of the minsk process . 
  is that realistic ? 
  is the german foreign-policy establishment willing to countenance that ? 
  *   what putin really wants is not something germany or france or the eu alone can offer . 
  maybe the white house can . 
  if we want to take the minsk process forward , it needs more direct involvement and participation by the us . 
  i was quite hopeful when i heard about how trump and putin would want to get along in the future . 
  that was five months ago . 
  now of course , trump has his hands cuffed . 
    ** economist : ** * almost literally . 
  *   the ukrainian issue will not be resolved between russia and western europe . 
  america will need to be involved . 
  and we ca n't go back on the 2008 communiqu\u00e9 . 
  trump ca n't say : `` we did n't mean that . '' but he could , after discussing this with allies and with kiev , tell the russian president : `` look , let us both work to have a real cease sire . 
  if you then get out of eastern ukraine , we can implement the minsk agreement together . 
  so let 's get that out of the way , end the sanctions and start talking about real issues . ''   i appreciate canadian efforts , but canada ca n't do it either . 
  historically speaking , we have not had a single conflict in europe since the suez crisis of 1956 where the us did not insist on being in the driver 's seat . 
  barack obama changed this in 2014 when he decided that the ukrainian conflict was not something that should be on his plate : `` let 's leave it to merkel '' . 
  i think that was wrong . 
  it was probably meant to encourage europeans to take things in their own hands , but it was just a step too much to ask of us at that point . 
  so i would 've preferred a minsk arrangement led by the us , the eu , germany , france and britain , with russia : the classic contact group arrangement . 
    remember : putin understands very well that there is a young urban population out there now that is not buying everything said by state propaganda . 
  and these people who go out and demonstrate , it 's a new phenomenon . 
  so i think there is this underlying worry in moscow that if ukraine happened to be turned into a model of prosperity and western success story , russians would increasingly ask the question : `` well , what about us ? 
  why ca n't we have the same thing ? '' so from the kremlin point of view , it is not so bad that ukraine is not doing so well for the time being . 
    ** on germany and america **   ** economist : ** * what should be angela merkel 's approach to donald trump ? 
  *   engage , engage , engage . 
  keep talking , talking , talking . 
  even if he does not like it . 
  there are some in germany who are so disenchanted with trump that they believe we should actually disengage , cut the umbilical cord and decide that the us can not be our partner any more . 
  i disagree . 
  i think , not only for reasons of nuclear strategy and dependence , that there 's not one international issue or challenge that we europeans can not face with greater hope of success if we do it together with the us rather than separately . 
  i would imagine that 's also what folks in britain think . 
  and if that 's a correct analysis that means that , as we look at all the chaos going on now , we should engage , engage , engage . 
    at the same time , the chancellor is right : we europeans have to take our fate in our own hands , as she said . 
  we have to build an eu which can act , and defend her interests , globally . 
  that is not at all an argument against strong transatlantic relations as some have interpreted it . 
  it just means that we have to assume more responsibility for ourselves . 
    we should welcome the fact that trump is coming to germany in july . 
  we should welcome the fact that he 's going to be meeting with putin in hamburg . 
  it is highly desirable from a german point of view that the white house and the kremlin speak to each other more than they did under obama . 
  so engage , engage , engage and do n't give up . 
  and merkel is very good at this . 
  she has dealt with putin for years and talks to him all the time , even if this is often quite frustrating . 
    ** economist : ** * in russian ? 
  *   she understands russian but mostly speaks german . 
  he understands german but speaks russian . 
  they have interpreters to be on the safe side . 
  merkel knows putin . 
  she is patient and does not get angry . 
  i mean , she gets angry , but she does n't show it . 
  most men would probably throw a temper tantrum and say something nasty after six hours of useless status-quo discussion , but she is very good at it . 
  she swallows it , then calls in again the next week and has yet another long discussion . 
  i admire that . 
  and if she can do this with putin , she surely can do it with trump . 
  and she should . 
    we need the united states . 
  and quite frankly , coming back from washington a couple of weeks ago , i 'm of two minds now . 
  i saw a highly professional team . 
  i met with john kelly , the homeland security secretary , with cia director pompeo and with director of national intelligence dan coats .
