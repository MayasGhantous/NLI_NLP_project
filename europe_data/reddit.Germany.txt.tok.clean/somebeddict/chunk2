  they 're all really good and experienced pros . 
    ** economist : ** * so the problem is the man in the white house . 
  *   yes . 
  a president who believes in unpredictability as a negotiating strategy . 
  but what works in real estate may not work in the same way in diplomacy . 
  in diplomacy , the major ingredient of success is trust . 
  no trust , no deal . 
   ** economist : ** * she proposed some quite bold tax reforms *   the message was : she wants to change things . 
  and that is why she almost lost . 
  she learned that the lesson to voters has to be : `` you know me , you know what i stand for , i am your mother , i will make sure you do n't freeze in the winter , things will be ok . '' that is her recipe . 
  the big challenge for merkel and for other leaders is to try to educate the german voter that we need to embrace change much more . 
  standstill is no option . 
    ** economist : ** * do you think germany is too comfortable ? 
  *   yes , we are . 
  and yet germans have a sense of doom and gloom . 
  they are still not happy . 
  i think the only part of the german society that has understood that change needs to be permanent is our famous mittelstand , the small - and medium-sized , family-owned businesses . 
  they are impressive champions of change . 
  i have a friend who owns a small company making packaging materials . 
  he is my age , 70 , and told me last year : `` we just opened a plant in western china . '' i said : `` you do n't even know where china is !, 
  how did that happen ? '' he said : `` we 've got to go with the flow . '' i tell my friends in the business community : you guys need to get involved in politics more . 
  where are those in the german bundestag who are by training , tradition or experience entrepreneurs , business leaders ? 
  there is a small handful at most . 
    ** economist : ** * it is curious because one thinks of the mittelstand as the very foundation of german stability , caution and incrementalism . 
  the notion that it is a source of dynamism is counter-intuitive . 
  *   yes , you would think that they would be conservative and resistant to change . 
  but no , they are global champions in their niches because they understand how much they need to change and reach out . 
    ** on germany and russia **   ** economist : ** * germany is seen as a temperamentally russia-friendly country , a sort of interpreter of russia to the rest of the west . 
  is that changing ? 
  is the german establishment becoming more sceptical of mr putin ? 
  *   yes , but the majority view in germany remains that we should do whatever we can to keep the door open . 
  there is a deep sense of obligation and gratitude here because of the political miracle of 1990 . 
  gorbachev accepted reunification when he could have said `` no '' . 
  richard von weizs\u00e4cker , our president back then , gave a speech saying : `` we must avoid simply moving the wall we are now tearing down 1,000 kilometres to the east . '' creating ways to include russia is still a relevant and important objective . 
  that is mainstream thinking . 
  so it was really quite courageous of merkel to show leadership on sanctions in 2014 . 
  that was unpopular at the time and still is among businesses . 
  many people here think : `` why are we imposing sanctions ? 
  who are the ukrainians ? 
  our important friends are the russians . ''   putin came to power 17 years ago . 
  for the first five years we had putin 1 . 
  then in around 2007 , when he gave a big speech at the msc , he changed into putin 2 . 
  putin 1 was a russian leader who declared in private and in public that he wanted to take russia westwards , that he was interested in the closest possible relationship with the eu . 
  i was staatssekret\u00e4r in our foreign office , deputy foreign minister if you will , at the time and i participated in a number of discussions chancellor schr\u00f6der had with putin . 
  and we had really constructive meetings on how to get rid of obstacles to trade and investment , and on how to move the bilateral agenda forward . 
  putin 2 is different . 
  he says : `` i 'm not going to be kicked around anymore . 
  i 've had it . 
  i 've told you over and over and over again that nato must not approach our borders . 
  you have decided not to listen to me , and i have decided to do whatever i need in order to defend my interests whether you like it or not . ''   ** economist : ** * so what had changed ? 
  *   nato was at the core of it . 
  the first steps of enlargement , in the 90s , were pre-consulted with russia . 
  remember that bill clinton wrote letters to boris yeltsin in the early-mid 90s hinting at the possibility of eventual russian membership in nato . 
  we created the nato-russia founding act saying we would not permanently deploy major combat troops to future nato member countries . 
  now fast-forward 10 years later to the spring of 2008 . 
  the bush administration proposed giving ukraine and georgia `` membership action plan '' status , a sort of pre-membership . 
  russia objected strongly . 
  we disagreed with bush . 
    ** economist : ** * `` we '' here being the germans ? 
  *   the french and a few others too . 
  and there was a big tussle at the nato summit in bucharest in 2008 , nine years ago , where bush , merkel and sarkozy had to do their own drafting because the issue had not been resolved by the ambassadors beforehand . 
  and at the end of the day the communiqu\u00e9 issued actually made things worse , not better . 
  it reads , `` georgia and ukraine will be members of nato , '' without a date given . 
  that was the point , in my interpretation , when putin decided : `` now i 've had it . 
  they 're not listening . 
  i 've told them 1,000 times that we need a buffer zone and here they go and take ukraine , which we consider an integral part of our society and is woven into our economy . 
  same thing in georgia . ''   ** economist : ** * and have subsequent events altered germany 's instinctive preference for harmonious relations with russia ? 
  *   i would say that we have been forced by the annexation of crimea etc to return to a cold war formula : as much defence as necessary and as much co-operation as possible . 
  i think that is the currently accepted mainstream thinking in this country . 
  in other words , we should not close the door to russia . 
  we should not abandon the nato-russia founding act . 
  others in the alliance said : `` let 's throw it out the window because the russians have violated it themselves . '' we defended it . 
  we said : `` we do n't want to cut all our relations with russia . 
  let 's preserve what we have so that we can go back to it one day . '' and god knows at what point , maybe , putin will find a reason to change his policies again . 
  but at this point , yes , we have changed our position . 
  most recently germany took a major decision , to deploy a german battalion in lithuania to defend it against russia . 
  that is a historic step for germany . 
    ** economist : ** * if what happened in ukraine plays out in the baltic countries , you could have a situation where german soldiers are facing off against partisans loyal to moscow . 
  that must be almost unthinkable for the german public . 
  *   it is quite unthinkable . 
  but our deployment decision is intended to deter exactly such scenarios from becoming reality . 
  the last thing putin needs is yet another , even bigger crisis with the west . 
  putin 's foreign policy has not really been a success story - it has diminished trust and created new enemies . 
  i represented the osce in ukraine a couple of years ago . 
  ukrainians used to think of the russians as `` our closest partner , our cousins '' . 
  today 42m ukrainians believe that the major threat to their national identity and security is russia . 
  how many foreign leaders attended world war two commemorations in moscow on may 9th ? 
  exactly one . 
  they 're isolated . 
  has the eurasian economic union taken shape in a meaningful way ? 
  not really . 
  so i think russia foreign policy is like a new years ' eve rocket : brilliant fireworks , but little positive and lasting effect . 
    in my view , this russian foreign policy is not sustainable in the long run . 
  if russia does n't do much more about reforming its economy , it ca n't afford these foreign activities for very long . 
  this is another reason why i think we should keep the door open . 
  our message to moscow should be : `` look , you have nothing to fear from your western partners . 
  we have an interest in a prosperous , stable russia . 
  we 'd like to go back to our investments . 
  but we 've got to have some commonly established rules first . '' will that happen ? 
  i ca n't see putin turning on a dime tomorrow .
