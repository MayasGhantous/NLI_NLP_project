  so i 'm pessimistic in the short term . 
  but i think the medium and the long term we must hold open the possibility of a more harmonious relationship . 
  that 's also the advice i give to ukrainians . 
  i tell them : `` you ca n't live forever in this state of military alert and even war with russia . 
  you are always going to be neighbours . 
  you need to think of benefits that could be gained , of compromises which could be offered , in order to obtain a diplomatic solution . 
  keep talking . '', 
   ** economist : ** * to voters ? 
  *   to voters , especially those left of centre . 
  because it would include what we do for refugees and for those dying in south sudan . 
  it wraps the 2 % debate into a larger strategic objective . 
  the 3 % approach makes more political sense : it includes non-military expenditures that increase stability and security . 
  we call it the comprehensive approach . 
    ** on germany and the bomb **   ** economist : ** * does germany need a nuclear deterrent ? 
    ** economist : ** * it does n't ? 
  we rely on the us . 
  it would be great if there were additional options . 
  but there are n't . 
  there have been some in this country who believe that this is the time to cut the umbilical cord across the atlantic because the americans are the bad guys . 
  that 's classic anti-americanism . 
  it goes back to the vietnam war . 
  but the truth of the matter is that there are no viable alternatives . 
  we are married to the american nuclear security umbrella , whether we like it or not . 
  germany is legally and politically bound to remain a non-nuclear nation . 
  full stop . 
   there have occasionally been tentative discussions with the french about the nuclear deterrent , under mitterrand , chirac and sarkozy . 
  do i think that the french nuclear force could evolve into a serious option for germany ? 
  well , one should never say never . 
  but that would require fundamental changes in how the french think about their own role and their nuclear deterrent . 
  so not only is there no way that would open the door for a german nuclear weapon , but there is also no sensible , meaningful , reasonable european nuclear option . 
  we do n't have a european decision maker -- not even to send 1,000 soldiers to mali . 
    ** economist : ** * `` who pushes the button ? '' *   that 's it . 
  britain has its pm . 
  france and the us have their presidents . 
  but the there are no button-pushers at the eu or franco-german levels . 
  i do n't see it as an option . 
  do i think we should keep talking with the french about possible future options ? 
  yes . 
  and we should also talk about the vision of a european army as a long term option . 
  but this is a matter of decades . 
    ** on the franco-german relationship **   ** economist : ** * emmanuel macron was in berlin the other day . 
  can german concessions on the eurozone be traded for french concessions on security and defence ? 
  *   in terms of re-invigorating eu integration , this is a historic opportunity . 
  we do n't yet know what the french parliament will look like . 
  will there be a clear and established parliamentary majority for emmanuel macron ? 
  probably . 
  and will there be a stable and pro-eu government in germany ? 
  most probably . 
  if so , i think this could be an enormous and unique opportunity not just to re-invigorate `` le couple franco-allemand '' , as they say in paris , but also to use it as a role model for the entire eu . 
  in the 80s and early 90s helmut kohl and fran\u00e7ois mitterand would write joint letters before each european council meeting . 
  this often opened the way to meaningful eu decision-making . 
  now , again , there will be great new opportunities for berlin and paris to take the eu forward . 
  and i would not see these as a trade of german business for french defence . 
  i would see them more as win-win situations . 
  macron and the next chancellor ...   ** economist : ** * let 's say it 's mrs merkel . 
  *   let 's start with security and defense : the two could , for example , decide that every new military procurement project above a certain amount will be done jointly . 
  if a general needs a new car , he can get a new car . 
  but if we need new fighter jets , tanks , or frigates , we will do it jointly . 
  and anyone in the eu who wants to join this process is invited to do so . 
  that would be one clear signal we mean business . 
    ** economist : ** * so it is not a concession to the french ? 
  *   it is not a concession . 
  it is a step forward . 
  wolfgang sch\u00e4uble and others have made proposals on the eurozone . 
  and emmanuel macron did not come to berlin the other week to say the e-word . 
  that was reassuring !, 
  *   eurobonds . 
  if he had said `` let 's start with eurobonds '' , i think the shutters would have gone down in our finance ministry , in the chancellery and in the political parties . 
    ** economist : ** * even if he had wanted eurobonds he would have been wise not to say so ... *   ... extremely wise not to mention it , certainly not before the german elections . 
    ** economist : ** * he seems to understand germany . 
  *   perfectly !, 
  i am actually reassured , quite frankly . 
    ** economist : ** * he speaks german , as everyone is observing . 
  *   the new prime minister speaks german . 
    ** economist : ** * yes , mr philippe . 
  do these things matter ? 
  *   yes they do . 
  when a frenchman like ayrault [ former french foreign minister , a german speaker ] comes over here it just helps the human relations . 
  bruno le maire [ economy minister ] speaks perfect german , practically with no accent , as does sylvie goulard , the new defense minister . 
  the former french ambassador here , philippe \u00c9tienne , has just been named macron 's national security adviser . 
  he is already in paris . 
  so that is reassuring , because philippe knows every single german politician on the left , on the right and in the middle . 
    ** on germany and the eu **   ** economist : ** * an exciting time ? 
  *   yes , and great opportunities . 
  proposals of a eurozone-finance ministry , a european finance minister , an emergency eurozone fund for countries that miss the deficit limit ... i think there are all kinds of ideas being floated , opportunities for the entire eu , but not involving a direct franco-german trade-off between finance and defence . 
  but i worry about germany as the so-called new central power in the eu ...   ** economist : ** * i believe the set phrase is `` the new leader of the liberal world '' . 
  *   wow . 
  the narrative is this : germany is not only imposing austerity on the eurozone , but also throwing its weight around in foreign-policy terms , telling the rest of the eu how to behave etc. 
  i think this is dangerous and totally unhelpful . 
  the founding principle of the eu is that even the smallest countries sit at the same table . 
  and one of the better experiences we germans had over the past decades was to treat the small eu states as equals . 
  you know , to allow the foreign minister of luxembourg the same number of minutes of speaking time as the uk or france . 
    in order to get rid of this negative narrative , we should put our growing economic stability , prosperity and foreign-policy credibility at the service of the eu 's own capacity to act . 
  what would be a good signal ? 
  there are several options . 
  here is one example : the next german government might wish to start a debate about majority voting in the eu in foreign policy and security . 
  it may , for all i know , never be accepted by all eu members . 
  but the fact of germans making this proposal could , in one stroke , eliminate this talk about germany pushing the others around . 
  it would be a marker for the future . 
  it would start a discussion .
