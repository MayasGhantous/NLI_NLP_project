    ** economist : ** * you talked about that time when germany and france would write joint letters to set the agenda in the eu . 
  germany would represent one cluster of interests within the union and france another . 
  and by reaching bilateral agreements they would balance out the different forces . 
  can that be the case today when the eu is so much bigger , with so many more conflicting interests ? 
  *   you are absolutely right . 
  i would not suggest that we try to go back to the 1990 . 
  the eu now has 28 members and franco-german initiatives alone would not necessarily represent all interests . 
  but even if we do n't write these `` kohl-mitterrand letters '' i think the franco-german engine can once more provide impulse . 
  this is a moment where people should start thinking outside the box . 
  the other day i saw a proposal for reviving the elys\u00e9e treaty between france and germany . 
  it goes back to the 1960s , plus some clauses added later . 
  but what about coming up with a 2018 version of it for this new century , with some far-reaching , common franco-german goals for the eu as a whole ? 
  ideas like this are great because they show people understand something needs to be done . 
  that the status quo is not an option . 
  that the eu is a process , not a finished product . 
    ** on germany 's relationship with change **   ** economist : ** * one of the greatest challenges for german policy makers is that the country has had to digest so much change : losing a war ; being readmitted post-holocaust into the western community of nations and accepted as a partner ; establishing the german mark ; overcoming the cold war and the wall ; digesting reunification with all its financial , cultural , social , and other implications ; giving up the mark for the euro . 
  lots of change , which is why many germans today hate change . 
  that 's why merkel almost lost the 2005 election . 
   ** the new germany - an interview with wolfgang ischinger **  ** germany 's best-connected former diplomat on its future in the world **   kaffeeklatsch  may 30th 2017by j.c. | berlin   wolfgang ischinger knows german foreign policy . 
  he was the country 's deputy foreign minister from 1998 to 2001 . 
  he was its ambassador to washington from 2001 to 2006 . 
  then he spent two years as its man in london . 
  since then he has been chair of the munich security conference ( msc ) , the world 's most important independent gathering of foreign and security policy experts . 
  most major leaders of the recent years -- angela merkel , hillary clinton , vladimir putin , fran\u00e7ois hollande , ali khamenei -- have been his guest . 
  few people have a more expansive perspective on germany 's role in the world . 
    i met mr ischinger in berlin to talk about germany 's global role . 
  britain 's vote for brexit , the victory of donald trump in america and that of emmanuel macron in france have together made this a pressing subject . 
  like it or not , mrs merkel is the only major world leader who combines influence , experience and stability . 
  so the instincts of her country 's foreign-policy establishment matter more than they have for years , and perhaps since world war two . 
  mr ischinger understands that foreign-policy establishment like few others . 
    so although it is long , i am publishing the transcript of our conversation . 
  among mr ischinger 's most striking points were his arguments that :  * germany is increasingly open to military action * brexit makes eu defence integration easier * germany 's deployments in afghanistan , mali and lithuania mark a real turning point * nato 's 2 % - of-gdp target for defence spending is not sufficient on its own * the 2 % should be replaced with a 3 % target encompassing defence , foreign policy and aid * mr trump 's statements make it harder for european leaders to contribute more to nato * germany should not contemplate its own nuclear weapon * mr macron 's election is an `` enormous and unique '' opportunity to relaunch the franco-german partnership as a model for the whole eu * the kohl-mitterrand era of co-operation can be ( partly ) revived , starting with joint military procurement * mr macron understands germany `` perfectly '' * germany and france should consider a 2018 rewrite of the elys\u00e9e treaty codifying the alliance between the two countries * germany should consider backing eu majority voting on foreign and security affairs * germany and france might eventually share nuclear weapons and an army , but only in the very long term * notions of germany as the new leader of the liberal world are `` totally unhelpful '' * russia 's current belligerence towards the west may not last * germany and the west must keep the door open to mr putin * europe and canada can not reform their relationship with russia without america * mrs merkel 's patience and russian language skills give her unique advantages in talks with mr putin * germany must `` engage , engage , engage '' with mr trump * mr trump has `` good and experienced pros '' in his team but `` believes in unpredictability as a negotiating strategy ''  for ease of reading i have divided up our talk into seven sections : germany 's military role , germany and the bomb , the franco-german relationship , germany and the eu , germany 's relationship with change , germany and russia , germany and the usa . 
    ** on germany 's military role **   ** the economist : ** * germany is moving towards a bigger role in the world . 
  do you think that berlin is ready for it ? 
  *  ** wolfgang ischinger : ** three or four years ago my answer would have been `` no '' . 
  but things have been changing rapidly . 
  until recently you would not have found many speeches by angela merkel focussing on defence . 
  that has changed . 
  she has embraced nato 's famous 2 % [ of gdp ] goal for defence spending agreed at the wales summit in 2014 . 
  and our former federal president gauck spoke at the msc 2014 of the greater responsibility that germany would need to assume in the future . 
  so things have changed . 
  having now seen the outcome of the french elections and looking toward our own election i think we are at an interesting and potentially decisive point in the history of the eu as a security provider . 
  britain often blocked the eu from taking steps towards becoming a defence player . 
  now the eu can begin to plan more creatively . 
  it makes no sense to think about security in german , french , italian terms . 
  we have to apply the principle of european integration to defence as we applied it to trade decades ago . 
    ** the economist : ** * you mean a joint command centre , common procurement ? 
  *   it starts with procurement . 
  we buy six times more weapons systems than the americans . 
  this is the most inefficient way to spend your defense euro . 
  the last time a member of the eu conducted a military operation alone was the falklands war . 
  so why would 28 countries want to maintain as many different national institutions to train their future generals ? 
  why ca n't we pool and share much more in terms of procurement , training and strategy ? 
  that does not lead directly to an eu army . 
  that would be premature because decisions about life and death , about war and peace , can only be taken at the national level , for constitutional and obvious political reasons . 
  but enormous gains in efficiency can be made even without an eu army proper . 
  and i think we could score significant points in moscow , washington and elsewhere around the world if we took strategic decisions along these lines to demonstrate that we intend to become a credible actor who can defend and pursue the strategic interests of 500m eu citizens . 
    ** the economist : ** * the move towards an eu army brings together countries with very different defence histories . 
  germany and france are brothers-in-arms in so many ways but are not both as willing to use military force . 
  do you think that forces germany to think about its role differently ? 
  *   absolutely . 
  absolutely . 
  there have been significant changes in german military and strategic thinking . 
  but i am not so sure that the man in the street has had a chance to properly digest all this . 
  i 'll give you two examples . 
  one : five or ten years ago it would have been impossible to imagine the bundestag sending german military contingents into mali . 
  there was a wide-spread assumption that if the uk or france lured us into africa it would only be to help them defend their post-colonial interests . 
  that has changed . 
  for a couple of years now we have had hundreds of soldiers in mali . 
  that is now almost generally accepted . 
  two : ten years ago i would have thought the sight of german coffins coming back from afghanistan would cause a hell of a political battle . 
  and frankly , the government had the same fears . 
    ** the economist : ** * about protests in the streets ? 
  *   yes . 
  as in : `` how can one claim that germany 's interests be defended in the hindu kush ? '' but we have been one of the most loyal participants in the afghanistan campaign since 2002 . 
  we may not have had the biggest contingent and may have been deployed in safer areas , but it produced a bitter debate here . 
  and in the process germans have learned to accept the deployment of their soldiers in foreign lands . 
  that was new . 
  there is one more example . 
  never before has germany deployed soldiers to another nato country with the objective of helping to defend it against a potential adversary . 
    ** the economist : ** * you mean in the baltic states ? 
  *   there are now contingents led by the us , canada , the uk , and germany . 
  and just one of them is a continental european power : germany . 
  this is a major departure . 
  when helmut kohl was chancellor , the dominant thinking was that sending german troops abroad was a terrible idea because it would remind people of atrocities committed by other german soldiers in world war two . 
  we have learned over the last 20 years that this concern was unfounded . 
  german soldiers in lithuania were greeted joyfully . 
  they are also building stability in kosovo and mali . 
  so there has been an evolution . 
  is this accepted by everybody ? 
  not quite . 
  it has been a silent defence revolution , somewhat under the public radar screen . 
    ** the economist : ** * the election campaign is coming up . 
  the spd has said it wo n't commit to the 2 % goal . 
  and foreign minister [ sigmar ] gabriel wants to combine military spending with aid and other things . 
  *   if we are demanding accountability , credibility and trust from mr trump , we need to apply that ourselves . 
  a promise is a promise and if we said yes to 2 % in wales , it has to stand . 
  but the trump administration demands a significant acceleration of this process . 
  that is nonsense . 
  if you simply focus on the 2 % , i bet that half of nato members would raise the pensions of their generals , give their installations a paint job and buy new limos for their ministers .
