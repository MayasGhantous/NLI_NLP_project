  this makes her likeable , and this likeability is why people vote for the cdu/merkel . 
  the election campaign over here is up till now as cold as never before ( so it seems ) . 
  merkel will most likely be re-elected , and there are nearly no political topics driving the campaings as nothing really gets to the people . 
  how could it , if merkel 's core asset is her mass appeal . 
  the rise of germany as a kind of hegemonic power in the eu , the criticism germany gets for their insistence on austerity as a solution for the struggling countries , this is n't even a real topic over here . 
  while this election is not about topics and thus merkel does n't need to convince , the current political situation makes that easy for her . 
  germany has saved several billions due to low interest rates , since loans are cheap for germany . 
  it is supposed to be safe harbour . 
  i heard the figure of 43bn euro , which germany saved due to that in the last years . 
  the crisis did n't hit us at all , yet . 
  the unemployment numbers are low , mostly because of doctoring the statistics and since the seemingly positive effects of the agenda 2010 ( a program of the spd , which essentially meant the demolotion of the welfare state , and an increase in atypical jobs , aswell as an increase in jobs in the low-wage sector , which makes the numbers look good ) took years to show an actual economic effect . 
  the results were attributed to her . 
  but , i ca n't stress this enough , this is just the background , which enables merkel to keep this election as apolitical as it is . 
  people do n't have to worry about unusual hardships , so they think everything is in order , while they still fear the collapse of the eu/euro and losing everything they have ( this is a bit irrational , yes ) . 
  so merkel seems like the safe option -- and her `` mom '' - style of politics provides security . 
  but honestly , i really do n't know why merkel or the cdu is that popular . 
  my explanation above reads a bit like a conspiracy theory . 
  but it is the only way i can come up with to explain the utter lack of political debate during this election . 
  did you notice that i did n't even talk about the opposition ? 
  well , there is n't really one . 
  that makes it much easier for merkel and at the same time her apolitical style of politic is what keeps the opposition small . 
  i meant the jus sanguinis , blood is in a strict sense a metaphor ( sanguis meaning blood in latin ) . 
  the wikipedia article explains the concept and why it 's still relevant in modern germany . 
  because `` nation '' is a concept that arose later and `` germany '' is essentially a notion which means `` a modern national state '' . 
  you have to stress the `` reich '' with the hrr . 
  it depends not on the nation in the ( modern ) sense outlined , but it sees itself as a successor of rome and is based in the medieval idea of dei gratia , i.e. 
  it is n't defined by the idea that you are a nation because you belong to that nation , but by the authority of the king based in god . 
  this is a very rough answer . 
  to answer in another way : `` germany '' was invented in that time , you can see that the discourses differed a lot from those discussing the hrr . 
  if you want to look into that , see benedict anderson 's imagined communities : reflections on the origin and spread of nationalism or here http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/nationalstaat / http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nation_state . 
  firecracker , thanks for your very interesting reply . 
  i 'm not a historian by profession and you seem to know the records much better than i do . 
  however , i think that this is not such much a question of historic records than a question of the history of ideas . 
  methodically , my approach can surely be challenged , as i tried to argue ex post . 
  the horizon in which my argument works is clearly the holocaust . 
  this is very abstract , i will come back to that further down . 
  ** ( a ) regarding the german history , the rise of the idea of germany . 
  **  you 're using a logical fallacy in your second paragraph . 
  ema was an antisemite ( which of course was true ) therefore everyone who had the same idea must have been one too . 
  this is right . 
  there is no point arguing with that . 
  however , i did n't mean it that way . 
  this is why i tried to explain the rise of german nationalism in difference to the the french idea of a nation . 
  while the french nation arose in a struggle for a better live , the german nation arose in a fight against napoleon . 
  antisemitism might not have been a core element in that fight , even though it still is a fight against the progressive values of the french revolution . 
  regarding antisemitism you write :  ema himself also emotionally fought against serfdom , also while objectively an antisemite you should take a look at the general view towards jews unfortunately held by the majority of the catholic germanies . 
  he does n't strike out far , so implying that german patriotism necessarily equals antisemitism is a vast overstatement . 
  i did n't mean to state that german patriotism leads in a necessary way to antisemitism . 
  i meant to show that it was n't an element that was strange to the german idea of a nation . 
  i do n't think that the general acceptance of antisemitism in `` germany '' makes the antisemitism of ema any better . 
  you are right to point out that he should n't be treated ahistorically ; but it shows that in the environment the idea of a german `` nation '' was born in , antisemitism was in the air . 
  this is what i meant above with an ex-post-approach : to not explain the holocaust as a slip-up , a economical necessity or something alien to germany in general , i think it is very useful to look for traces of the ideology of the nsdap in the german history . 
  regarding my account of the french nation :  the pamphlet ( you mean sieyes ' ? , spinasatapom ) can be seen as an early draft of the ideas marx would later have and revolutionary france went through basically every political system in the book , but in the end we had a french `` nation '' which again defined by exclusion ( being french ) . 
  we have that situation today , for example a reason why most french people i know refuse to speak english when in france . 
  well , sieyes ' pamphlet was one of the most printed pamphlets of that time and was quite influential , especially regarding what the french idea of a nation was . 
  i did n't mean to imply by citing him to make * any * statement about modern france . 
  this has to be understood in different terms ; i meant to have a contrast the german idea of a nation . 
  first you talk of the us as an exclusive nation :  the usa built their idea of an american nation by excluding themselves from the british and violently gaining independance . 
  after that the us entered a phase of complete isolation in foreign politics for about a hundred years . 
  then you shift the categories and measure germany by the extent of the territory :  in fact , if anything the first idea of a unified germany was inclusive , after all all germanies were sovereign countries at the moment . 
  the idea to unify several countries was about as bold as suggesting to merge the benelux nations into one nation . 
  when i said `` inclusion '' i meant the very basic question of any nation : `` who is part of that nation ? '' . 
  traditionally , you get the right of a citizen in the us if you are born there . 
  in germany , traditionally the ancestry of your parents is what 's the deciding factor . 
  this is why i quoted the jus sanguinis . 
  i think your points may be valid . 
  however , i do n't see how they are relevant for the measurement of the exclusiveness of a nation . 
  while politics are to a large degree contingent , the question of being part of a nation is a core element of that very concept . 
   you also conveniently ignore the march revolutions ( where we first would see black-red-gold as a flag ) and the frankfurt national assembly . 
  yeah , i cheated on that one . 
  but i did so because 1848 is such a clutter of ideologies . 
  i like to argue with the time of the german campaign 1813-1814 because they are not as ideologically-laden . 
  if you talk about the march revolution , we first have to talk about its relevance . 
  the paulskirche is a sacred place of the frg and it likes to call upon the tradition of the revolutionaries of 1848 . 
  the fathers and mothers of the grundgesetz liked to set themselve in that tradition . 
  this does n't mean , however , that it had any historical influence . 
  1848 is used to establish a good german tradition . 
  it is used to veil the german campaign , and the very fact that it had no real influence : germany was born because prussia wanted it , the weimar republic , because the old forces were ruined in wwi , and the only stable democracy on german territory , the frg , because the us imposed it on the german people ( which i 'm happy for ) . 
   march revolutions ( where we first would see black-red-gold as a flag ) it 's wrong to attribute the flag to 1848 , it traces back to , again , the german campaign against napoleon . 
  the colours were used by the l\u00fctzow free corps , a unit of the prussian army and were then adopted by some students , who made them popular in 1848 . 
  ** ( b ) the consequences of ( a ) **  correlation does not necessarily equal causation no , it does n't . 
  but while this is true , it does n't mean that there is n't a connection between the rise of nationalism ( with which i mean the party-nationalism of 2006 and the following years ) and the the rise of attacks on `` foreigners '' . 
  surely there are more factors than flags at a football game . 
  however , if you create an atmosphere of a relaxed nationalism , you make it much easier to promote certain ideas . 
  iirc , there were polls that showed clearly that people were more at ease with saying `` i 'm proud of germany '' or `` i 'm proud to be a german '' after the 2006 . 
  again , this does n't mean it was caused by the celebrations of the nation . 
  however , the discussion in the media and in public was about the great party-nationalism , how germans can now be finally proud of their country again . 
  i think that a causal nexus is very likely here . 
  that party-nationalism creates an atmosphere in which it is much more easy for neo-nazis ( by which i mean their ideas and actions promoted by those ideas ) to seem normal . 
  ** ( c ) your conclusions **  if you look at the historic tradition there is basically no difference between german idea of a nation and other ideas i 'm sorry , but your argument showed a lot , but it does n't prove that point ( see ( a ) ) . 
  you compared the france of today with the early germany as an idea of 1812 , and mixed the us foreign policy with the question of what constitutes a nation . 
  your argument does n't lead to that conclusion . 
   none of your articles actually prove patriotism to be politically wrong . 
  that depends on your first conclusion , which is logically wrong . 
   the `` good reasoning '' for germans to celebrate its nation is as follows : people tend to identify themselves with other people they happened to be unified with . 
  there is nothing wrong with that , it does not necessarily promote xenophobia and it 's a way of getting everyone to achieve a certain goal ( take the moon landing for example ) . 
  it promotes xenophobia , racism , antisemitism as it evokes a tradition in which these are core elements . 
  this i tried to show above as best as i could . 
  when i asked for a `` good reasoning '' , i meant that i do n't see how nationalism or patriotism is working in a democracy in good way . 
  the democratic state should be there to help fulfilling my needs , to enable me or to guarantee my freedom or human dignity .
