  it did n't mean change , just so that journalists had something to report . 
  progress itself is not a left category . 
  why should it be ? 
  yeah right , the big jewish population in hungary is the reason for their antisemitism . 
  over here in germany we have only a few jews left and still antisemitism is huge here : http://forward.com/articles/168948/german-travelogue-unveils-stubborn-anti-semitism/?p=all so , antisemitism is n't something which jews are in any way accountable for . 
  it 's about having a culprit . 
  edit : looked up the numbers . 
  according to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jewish_population_by_country there are about 10,000 jews living in hungary . 
  that is n't even that much . 
  never heard about antisemitic problems in france or the us ( and in anyway not in that extent as in hugary ) for example , which have a greater jewish population ... 
  well , it misses the very sad recent developments . 
  i mean the antisemitic and antiziganistic gouvernment and the huge support it has amongst the population . 
  i could n't come up with a good english source for that right now , but here is a text which supports my statements : http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/24/opinion/bruni-in-hungary-the-usual-scapegoats.html?_r=0, 
  please do note that `` unemployment rate '' is a bit of a misleading concept as it includes people in eduction as well ( a ) . 
  there is a reason to do so , i suppose , as studying is often used as an excuse when there is no proper job available . 
  however , the figure does not represent those of the youth who are in need of a job . 
  if you are interested in statistics , check out [ eurostat ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/youth_unemployment ) ( from which the statistics cited stem most probably and which gives you free access to a lot of numbers ) . 
  they also [ explain ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/youth_unemployment ) the above mentioned reason why `` 65 % '' is often understood wrongly . 
  another interesting figure shows that more than 31 % is at risk of poverty and social exclusion , 15.2 % are severely materially deprived ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/europe_2020_indicators/headline_indicators ) . 
  * this * is shocking in a country part of the eu , which consists of some of the richest countries in the world . 
  i think this is a fine example how badly the press is reporting on greece . 
  you could , just as an example , interpret the bad rating greece gets as a sign that austerity is n't the answer . 
  however , in germany the news nearly in unision say something like `` they do n't save enough ! '' . 
  you just get very few reports on the really shitty living condition in greece . 
  you get nearly no in-depth analysis ( for which the journalists often just do n't have time , i presume ) . 
  i for one do n't have an opinion here anymore . 
  i just know : what germany , large part of the troika wants is just wrong . 
  this has been shown . 
  what we need is to look at europe at large in order to understand what can be done in greece ; with the same currency , on a economic level the euro group is nearly as much integrated as the us . 
  if i read about detroit , no one only talks about michigan . 
  we have to talk about the far to cheap labour in germany and the massive export excess . 
  if there are surplus funds on the one side , there must be money missing on the other !, 
  this is obvious !, 
  so let 's raise our salaries in germany ( just to get it on a level with productivity ) especially and the eu in general ( to a lesser degree , as the income has risen much more in relation to the productivity in recent years ) and let 's see what happens . 
  maybe that helps more ? 
  a few years ago , this was a position argued to be just obvius by radical leftists . 
  now even an eu commisoner says so : http://euobserver.com/economic/119984 ( a ) this i * guess * here as the newspaper linked does not provide a source for their figures . 
  as you can see in my statements above , this is however likely if the number has n't exploded from 16 % ( 2012 ) to 65 % ( 08/2013 ), 
  depends if the bakery has a slicing machine . 
  most bakeries have . 
  or something alone that line . 
  that 's an expected question in a bakery and if they do n't have a machine they will politely reply that they have n't a possibility to do so . 
  pretty straight forward :-) ( and if your german is n't good enough , try it in english or make some gestures . 
  nearly all german , who are in working age , have a decent command of english . 
  just do n't yell `` cut it !! '' . 
  that could be creepy . ), 
  what ? 
  where ? 
  one more reason to go there , 
  some bakeries carry that , too . 
  just go look around . 
  it often comes as * kastenbrot * . 
  personally i 'm not a big fan of them ... 
  interesting though , there is n't really a good translation for * wurst * . 
  to my knowledge there is n't any . 
  and there is a variety of wurst . 
  and it sounds so very , very german : wurst ( `` voooourrsd '' ) , like something sneaking up on you in a dark alley and desiring to put you slowly trough a * fleischwolf * ( mincer , literally meat wolf ) . 
  it used to be different , as i heard , though . 
  it started to go downhill when the uk privatised their infrastructure . 
  this is the way germany is headed , too . 
  and in 30 years or so no one will remember any more that it was better and could have once even be good . 
  yeah but that 's such an ugly thought . 
  as if the * common people * were so dumb to succumb to such an act of trickery . 
  but then ... 
  because there are like 250120 different kinds of bread !, 
  if you do n't like sonnenblumenbrot , try some kartoffelbrot or stuten ? 
  what about a good hefezopf ? 
  i also like my schwarzbrot . 
  and a brezel with a bit of butter , it 's nice , too !, 
  * ( * ) sadly , nowadays you really have to search a good bakery . 
  most of them are only heating up frozen lumps of dough . 
  because germans do n't like to pay for food . 
  ever compared the supermarket prices of germany and pretty much any other european country ? 
  i know it 's a cliche . 
  but ... 
  i really like the selection of bread we have over here . 
  and quark !, 
  but beside this two things , there is n't anything which comes to my mind . 
  even the beer selection is great in other places , too . 
  well , firstly you misinterpret politics as making symbolic acts in order to make people seem comfortable with something . 
  it is not . 
  politics is not about telling a tale of honey and milk , it 's about interests . 
  secondly , is saving really the right way ? 
  did it help greece ? 
  did it help japan ? 
  did it help indonesia ? 
  did it help argentine ? 
  how would that be helping anyone ? 
  would n't it be a boost to an economy if all the salaries were raised by 20 % ? 
  i for one am a fan of high salaries . 
  for everyone . 
  well , i think the rise of the us to a superpower is much more complex . 
  and regarding reperations : we have to differentiate between the gdr ( ddr ) and the frg ( brd ) . 
  here is a good summary of what has ( not ) been paid : ( in german : http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/reparation#deutsche_reparationszahlungen_nach_1945 ) . 
  the figure here is quite interesting : the frg has paid 2,1 bn dm ( prices of 1953 ) , the gdr 99,1 bn dm ( prices of 1953 ) . 
  thus the gdr has paid , per capita , 130-times more . 
  with the beginning of the cold war , the claims had been suspended until a peace treaty was to be signed . 
  which happened ( 2 +4 treaty ) , but which did n't raise this topic anymore . 
  i find it interesting that we today are , in a way , still profiting from the largely intact industries after ww2 , which allowed the frg to build up its economic power of today . 
  thus germany has been punished for ww2 with wealth .
