  http://news.yahoo.com/hungary-says-migrant-influx-stops-114617312.html from 10000/day down to 41/day from one moment , no fence , to the other , fence . 
  thats a drop of 99.5 % . 
  * [ the guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/26/rotherham-sexual-abuse-children ) : * `` vital evidence was ignored '' * * [ independent ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/rotherham-child-sexual-abuse-scandal-the-lessons-we-need-solutions-not-scapegoats-9701623.html ) : * between 2005 and 2010 when evidence on the scale of abuse became unambiguous * * [ bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-29957511 ) : * `` the evidence that i 've seen and the girls that i 've spoken to , tell stories that suggest to me that there 's something going on at a systematic level , where the police [ were ] actively preventing cases going forward against these perpetrators . 
  '' * every evidence is weak if systematical hidden , ignored and covered up . 
   i 'll accept that nobody really cares if merkel or you accept something . 
   you can vote for them i am not allowed to vote . 
  i am migrant . 
   why on hell did this whole mess had to happen ? 
  why ? 
  because merkel . 
   skinheads and more neo nazis . 
  ah , the old classic of labeling anyone who is n't inline on merkel 's death-drive a nazi . 
  sorry to break the news : it does n't work anymore . 
  just look around you and realize that the situation is [ shifting ] ( http://www.derwesten.de/staedte/essen/der-essener-norden-schafft-das-nicht-id11442282.html ) . 
  people demand to [ restore the control ] ( http://www.nzz.ch/meinung/kommentare/deutsche-ablenkungsmanoever-1.18674206 ) and right now that means voting extremists like afd , csu or maybe even ( unlikely ) fdp . 
  yes , true . 
  we should only let in who had asylum granted already . 
  means we should process outside like e.g. 
  we have many who `` escape '' all the time . 
  * some old [ examples ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/3n7f5q/de_maizi\u00e8re_fordert_ankommenskultur_der/cvli2u0 ) that people vanish all the time from centers and are not seen anymore . 
  nobody knows or cares whats with them . 
  * also our situation is probably similar to [ sweden ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ob8ou/swedish_police_many_refugees_disappear_without/cvvqa00 ) where for every asylum seeker another one enters who does n't even register for asylum ( 1 to 1 ) . 
  nobody knows or cares who or where they are . 
  of course our media and officials went complete silent on this aspects . 
  so , if you read news like `` cologne gangrape attacks , only 60 % asylum seekers '' then there is a reason no details are given about the other 40 % ... 
  the [ gallup report ] ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/124028/700-million-worldwide-desire-migrate-permanently.aspx ) from 2009 , ie before syria/afghanistan/etc : * roughly 210 million adults around the world would like to move to a country in the european union * and since then we reach each year [ new all-time highs ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/558193896.html ) as war and persecution increase . 
  that while world population grows rapid , in the most poor countries , and climate change start to hit in , mostly at the most poor countries again . 
  i am not aware of any forecast that does n't predict future heavy growing number of migrants/refugees in the years to come . 
  as the [ unhcr says ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/25/eu-refugee-crisis-tip-of-iceberg-unhcr ) : * `` i do n't see it abating , i do n't see it stopping . 
  if anything it gives an indication perhaps that this is the tip of the iceberg , '' *, 
  it does [ not work in sweden ] ( http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/swedens-ugly-immigration-problem/article26338254/ ) too . 
  thats why they [ closed there borders ] ( http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/46/46719/1.html ) too now . 
  afd is somewhere at 9 % now and they still gain with the recent shift not counted in . 
  there is no doubt that they will get in . 
  the biggest question is if they manage to become second biggest power till then . 
  we will see . 
  it seems to be some kind of write-only database . 
  maybe the recycle bin database ? 
  more `` funny '' keypoints : * the man was registered under 4 different names/aliases . 
  * he was registered as syrian , moroccan , georgian . 
  * he did commit criminal activity in the past and was known by police . 
  * one day he just vanished from the center and that was it . 
  edit : fixed `` typo '' . 
  thanks / u/thachauda :-), 
  obviously well educated people , who like to work hard and profit from results , are welcome no matter the origin . 
  we need basic migration strategies like backgroundchecks , a point-system , etc. 
  and proper select matching candidates . 
  in short : the thing us , canada , every sane country , does . 
  we do n't need to stop migration from middle east or africa . 
  but we need to start to look at the people . 
  we do not want the criminal fallout of those ( or other ) countries but the educated ones . 
  by opening the doors and offering everybody a free pass , including erasing/forgetting about there criminal past , we are sucking in exactly this kind of criminals . 
  only problem is that re-education is very hard to impossible . 
  you will have to trust into your parents and surroundings to get proper values , like raping is not ok , into your mind early on otherwise its probably to late . 
  you have to see that in the context of all the past months media reports . 
  in that context every single sentence is a master piece . 
  here in germany we are happy to find articles in regular massmedia that do not pr-bullshit 100 % . 
  its really an exception . 
  but the real surprise is its spiegel . 
  i never would have guessed that they may the first to do journalismn again . 
  whats next ? 
  bild writing articles in proper german ? 
  we opened the doors . 
  of course do all kind or people enter now and try to use the situation . 
  the thing is , it works . 
  so , why are you surprised now ? 
  because you did n't try them when 20 of your `` wingmans '' surround and grope your target ... 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/biometric_passport#countries_using_biometric_passports * currently , the british and irish biometric passports only use a digital image and not fingerprinting . 
  * * according to eu requirements , only nations that are signatories to the schengen acquis are required to add fingerprint biometrics . 
  * http://www.schengenvisainfo.com/schengen-visa-countries-list/ * ireland and the united kingdom remain opt-out *, 
  in [ 2007 ] ( http://dipbt.bundestag.de/extrakt/ba/wp16/81/8198.html ) . 
  old passports where still valid till expired . 
  see [ \u00a7 4 and \u00a7 6 at pa\u00dfg ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/pa_g_1986/bjnr105370986.html#bjnr105370986bjng000100319 ) . 
  note that we are talking here about the * passport * and not about the optional , unneeded and useless plastic-toilet-paper of * national id-card * . 
  4 abs . 
  * short translation : there is no requirement , as in limitation by laws in place , that the fingerprints are only stored and used for the passport . 
  thats the ruling of the highest european court . 
  netherlands stores them in a central register already for example . 
  of course do we - in germany , the country of vds and ttip - store them too . 
  data is gold and gold is worth hard money . 
  also it will come in handy for slashing down future riots of the poor . 
  national id-cards ( aka plastic toilet paper ) , which you maybe refer to when writing `` passport '' ? , are not but reisepass , travel passport ( aka the real thing ) , are . 
  thanks . 
  * only 2 % of refugees have jobs . 
  http://de.reuters.com/article/domesticnews/iddekbn0tx0h520151214 * only 10 % have the minimum qualification required for any jobs . 
  http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/45/45952/1.html * 90 % are on social welfare . 
  http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article149555085/fluechtlinge-sollen-arbeitsmarktstatistik-nicht-verderben.html * 65 % can hardly read and write . 
  http://www.zeit.de/2015/47/integration-fluechtlinge-schule-bildung-herausforderung * 70 % abort in germany started education programs . 
   this is an eu problem , because germany is also bound by eu regulations national interests always trump whats left of the eu . 
  welcome to reality . 
   shall develop they shall plan to do since decades and nothing happened . 
  when riding a dead horse ... 
  have been fingerprinted since its mandadory if you need a new passport . 
  translated : countries using language analysis have lesser deportions according to eurostat . 
  its not an eu wide problem . 
  now that sweden closed its doors only germany is left . 
  all other eu countries are just on the route like all the non-eu countries where . 
  passing through till germany decides its closed too ** is ** the eu-wide solution . 
  not have a passport and not cooperate when ask where you are from is enough .
