see iceland . 
  the reform started last year . 
  nothing to do with the cologne attacks . 
  most people in germany do n't even know about sanders . 
  today : oggersheim . 
  the people who have read about the so called invitation are able to read any other information , too . 
  yeah , sure . 
  today an interview with a manager of a company that produces mailboxes . 
  and this shit is clogging the media right now . 
  no more panama , no more ttip , ... 
  and then ? 
  who should take over ? 
  i fucking hate this bullshit . 
  there 's even a version with turkish subtitles : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=349vwbgicuq, 
  the germans who still have to test wild boar meat for cesium isotopes because of chernobyl ? 
  thank you . 
  this was really ridiculous . 
  every media outlet was quoting the same sources and everybody was believing it . 
  now german media is quoting ` het laatste nieuws ' . 
  fun show to see how this is developing . 
  too important to just rely on rt. 
  are there any other sources ? 
  that 's old thinking . 
  take a look at / r/futurology / and come to the 21st century . 
  concerns ? 
  less is better . 
  we have limited resources . 
  yeah , germany is winning !, 
   i assume there will be a 180 degrees change in policy by merkels in early summer . 
  the first elections are in march . 
  and mid february they want to [ say something ] ( https://www.bundesregierung.de/content/de/artikel/2016/01/2016-01-18-flucht-und-asyl-aktuell.html ) . 
  do n't you think she looks tired ? 
  there is nobody else . 
  there are huge billboards in africa with psas about not raping women . 
  a few years ago i laughed about the absurdity of it . 
  people from western societies have traveled into muslim countries and behaved just fine , most of the time . 
  why should n't this be possible the other way around ? 
  you do n't run naked on the beaches of dubai . 
  you do n't drink alcohol . 
  you do n't order bacon . 
  can somebody please explain this to me : they use the internet . 
  they find information on the internet about the best route to the country they want to flee too . 
  they keep contact to the people they left behind and to the ones they know in the countries they are going to . 
  why do n't they find the following information : * the people who get you into europe are dangerous criminals who do n't care about your life and do n't care about keeping a promise and fulfilling a contract . 
  * it 's very risky to travel in overcrowded and unsafe boats over the mediterranean sea . 
  many people die . 
  among them a lot of small children . 
  * you risk the life of your children . 
  * you do n't find a paradise . 
  do n't believe the lies about $ 1000 , an easy job , and a house . 
  * you ca n't behave like an asshole . 
  * there are no welcome parties anymore because of the actions of a few . 
  the pictures of dead children are all over the news . 
  why do n't they reach the refugees ? 
  there was a green card program during schr\u00f6der 's time as chancellor . 
  the first few new immigrants with a green card were unemployed a short time after it . 
  seems like there was no real demand . 
  germany does n't really need workers . 
  it 's a lie . 
  i drive a french car and use an american phone manufactured in china . 
  maybe it 's time to accept that it 's not possible to keep everybody employed . 
  the future developments in automation ( robots and software ) will lead to more unemployment in a faster rate than before . 
  another plan is needed . 
  it worked well for us ( and very well for few of us ) the last few centuries but now times have changed . 
  germany . 
  nothing happened . 
  boring week . 
  not good . 
  now it reminds me of [ frenzy ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068611/reference ) . 
  i now count 3 different people who frequent the garbage cans behind the local supermarket . 
  i can see it from my window at work . 
  2 elderly men and recently a younger ( middle aged ? ), 
  woman who is dressed well . 
  old policies for a new world . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  that 's a perfectly straight song . 
  * sipping my appletini . 
  this is better : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rhine-neckar, 
  see https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4rc2np/this_van_is_currently_driving_through_london/d4zxh55?context=1 ;-), 
  [ ich will nicht nach berlin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4udrz3stqes ) ( kraftklub ), 
  especially when it 's from the [ fdp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_democratic_party_ ( germany \\ ) ) . 
  the party with so much economic wisdom that they are in debt . 
  that 's the right attitude . 
  germans will always tell you that their english is n't very good and then start talking about complicated grammar topics . 
  fdp is missing on this list : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_frivolous_political_parties, 
  people do n't learn . 
  i watched fawlty towers . 
  i think this is the world famous british humo ( u ) r. 
  a lot of people are getting hammered now . 
  at least he will be remembered . 
  if there will be any records of it after the next european war . 
  they do n't magically become a member of the eu after this . 
  they need to apply and wait . 
  take a number . 
  what i 'm wondering : why is a simple majority of the votes enough for this big decision ? 
  other countries need at least 2/3 more `` yes '' voted for this to happen . 
  rich brits can still afford european food . 
  shit , he is on to us . 
   and germany has been ramping up coal power what 's your source for that ? 
  on wikipedia : https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/kohlekraftwerk#/media/file:energiemix_deutschland.svg ( ... kohle = coal , kernenergie = nuclear power ) and the here is a list of planned coal-fired plants : https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/liste_geplanter_kohlekraftwerke_in_deutschland their status : * plan invalid * planning on hold * planning stopped * intend to start building in 2017 * planning .
