do not fear . 
  this new project , codename `` flugursula 2020 '' , will be different . 
  it will be 3 time more tax money wasted !, 
  of course chuck norris was there first . 
  on an unrelated note its named moscow chuck norris parade now . 
  [ planned in germany , trained in the us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hamburg_cell ) . 
  knowing our services it was probably news to them that isis plans attacks in europe . 
  he may able to give 2-3 more important insights to them . 
  whatever helps to end the war should be done . 
  that should be the by far biggest priority . 
  if assad helps on that then so be it . 
  only very small numbers of refugees are in apartments . 
  our housing situation is of course very bad because nobody did proper plan in advance . 
  fact is turkey does an amazing job here and there is no reason to not acknowledge it . 
   a refugee is someone whose application for asylum has been accepted . 
  not in germany . 
  you can be accepted as refugee without ever getting asylum . 
  in fact our [ article 32a ] ( http://www.info4alien.de/auslg.htm#32a ) even demands that refugees , accepted under this article , cancel pending asylum requests . 
  the reason we not apply 32a but give asylum is caused by the question who pays for all that , merkel or the states . 
  with asylum its mostly the states and they can not even reject or decide about anything unlike with 32a . 
  probably its similar like in sweden where for [ every asylumn seeker one goes underground ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ob8ou/swedish_police_many_refugees_disappear_without/cvvqa00 ) , 1:1 . 
  we indeed do not even count how much enter , how much of them claim asylum vs go underground . 
  no official is interested to drastical grow the scary numbers even more . 
  so just not counting them is our long-term solution . 
  we also exclude asylants from our unemployment statistics now to keep the numbers sexy . 
  let me explain how it works here : our highest court , guard of our constitution , is n't some regular court . 
  they do not decide the case itself but decide about the fundamental things related to our basic laws surrounding a case . 
  what happened is that a german court below used the echr convention 8 as reason for a ruling . 
  then the father went to the highest court because his basic laws where violated by that . 
  thats when our highest court comes in . 
  they decided a few things to the case itself : * basic laws where violated . 
  * the ruling of the lower court is void . 
  * another lower court needs to handle the case again . 
  remember that court is not responsible for such details like the future processing of the case . 
  but it 's responsible and did futuremore decide that : * european court of human rights are not always binding on german courts . 
  this is a fundamental decision because it means what it says and it applies to all our courts . 
  google for a followup-case like `` hannover v. germany '' where our minister of justice even explicit did not appeal because `` echr is not binding to our courts '' based on the decision of our highest court . 
  when this decision was done , and the link published in 2004 , that where the decisions . 
  set in stone . 
  the case itself got moved back to a lower court , it took that decision of our highest court in and reruled later the fathers case again according . 
  case closed . 
  uk is doing the same : [ 1 ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/12030457/david-camerons-plan-to-scrap-the-human-rights-act-delayed-until-2016.html ) and [ 2 ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/may/24/british-courts-echr-leveson ), 
   in favor not the case . 
  see [ this ] ( https://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/shareddocs/pressemitteilungen/en/2004/bvg04-092.html ) case from 2004 where a decision by the echr did violate a german father fundamental right of our consitution basic law . 
  our highest court overturned the echr to prevent that from happening and restore basic law for that father . 
  i would say russia makes sure , just like germany did over 10 years ago , that the current layers of protection including constitutional basic rights stay in place and can not be `` adjusted '' by some random european entity . 
  there citizens will love it like ours do :-), 
  in 2004 germans highest court , guard of our constitution , [ overruled the european court of human rights ] ( https://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/shareddocs/pressemitteilungen/en/2004/bvg04-092.html ) too and also declared that judgments handed down by the european court of human rights are not always binding on german courts .

  this is about `` active whatsapp users '' . 
  if you not regular login you are not counted as active user . 
  [ stats about whatsapp penetration in selected countries ] ( http://www.statista.com/statistics/291540/mobile-internet-user-whatsapp/ ) . 
  its for example active used on 57 % of mobiles in germany . 
  thats a hell of a reach . 
   products with high profit margins the users are the products . 
  think beyond ads . 
  [ iran takes steps towards legalising cannabis ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/drugs-laws-iran-takes-steps-towards-legalising-cannabis-marijuana-a6709176.html ) . 
  that may render the alcohol prohibition , and other things , lesser relevant :-), 
  i am not sure i understood your point . 
  it sounds like it tries to argue about something thats is irrelevant as defined above or ? 
  when the fences where build dublin ii was still active . 
  so , either let them in and handle it all yourself or not let them in and let someone else handle it . 
  the first would result in the greece + italy situation : hungary has to handle and pay it all themself , nobody else cares , there is no problem since its hungary 's problem . 
  the later did result in huge media echo and public awareness . 
  that did then open the theird option : pass through . 
  and only that did result in the eu finally realizing its an european problem that needs a solution ( we are still waiting for the second part but well ) . 
  no doubt is orb\u00e1n an asshole but hes definitive not the only one in europe . 
  sometimes an asshole is the better solution to counter others . 
  looks as this was such a case . 
  majority of germans disapproves this clusterfuck . 
  thats why merkel does another u-turn now . 
  the failure orb\u00e1n 's govt did is to not handle the whole thing alone , so northern countries could keep on to ignore and pretend there is no problem , like greece and italy did past years . 
  he basically answered : this is also your problem and not only ours , so f + ck you , we are not going to play the chinese wall for you and play buffer . 
  of course only neonazi lunatics riot against refugees . 
  the other riot against how there government handles the situation and how the eu fails so spectecular misserable to find working solutions . 
  most , if not close to all , of this leftist people are not violent . 
  they are not there to act like animals . 
  its only a very small minority . 
  i would assume thats true for both sides . 
  which of the animals stays alive is irrelevant since nobody cares about them . 
  the problem is they bring there mental issues forward and push them onto the normal humans . 
  right/left/politics / religion/etc are just the usual excuses to group and justify . 
  blair 's law applies , the far right and far left extremists are just the same messy extremists . 
  there is no difference between these idiots and they form one big giant . 
  now his point is : go fuck yourself giant and stay away from us 99 % non-violant normal humans . 
  if these autonomous ~ ~ left ~ ~ extremists realized meanwhile how they got used to sabotage the real left , support the right , and how well that worked out ? 
  i fear not even that . 
  or look at the [ korean prisoner training ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hmnk7lh9m3o ) to counter a zombie-apocalypse . 
   it does n't matter who made them ... ... or who sold them . 
  signed by serbia and germany :-), 
  in theory . 
  in [ reality ] ( http://www.veenweiden-oras.nl/upload/climate%2520scenarios%2520knmi%25202006.pdf ) countries like the netherlands , which is already in large parts below sea level , can handle a future increase of 1.5 m without problems . 
  the scenario expects 1-3m till year 2300 ( page 56 ) . 
  guess we have many time left to invent , optimize and increase investment into infrastructure like keeping valuable land . 
  also [ chapter 19 of the wgii tar ] ( http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch19s19-3-7.html ) : * there is high confidence that developing countries will be more vulnerable to climate change than developed countries *, 
  [ in 2011 ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/greece-plans-border-fence-to-keep-out-illegal-immigrants/a-14747138 ) greece actually asked for support from frontex . 
  finally [ yesterday ] ( http://frontex.europa.eu/news/frontex-accepts-greece-s-request-for-rapid-border-intervention-teams-amcpjc ) frontex accepted the request from greece . 
  its the eu that refused things like a [ `` pointless border fence '' ] ( http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/greece-immigration.f17 ) in 2012 because these are `` short term measures that do not solve issues in a structural way '' and of course we know , by now , how much the eu cared to apply its `` structural way '' of doing nothing , panic , trying and failing horrible with there structural way of forcing quotas and sending strong worded letters around . 
  that system is out of touch far beyond its missing democratic legimitation .
