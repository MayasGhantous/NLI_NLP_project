  now lets ignore that this numbers are about ** registered ** ( detected ) cases and [ compare ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/eu-border-agency-frontex-records-soaring-migrant-numbers/a-18656908 ) with the frontex numbers first 6 months : `` almost 340,000 migrants were seen at the border in the first half of the year '' that ** seen ** ( detected ) number doubled from first 6 months to first 9 months . 
  thats ** factor 2 ** within last 3 months . 
  take the numbers and extrapolate over a year but add that grow-factor in for your own interest . 
  i am sure your numbers would be lesser optimistic then mine . 
  * german : [ regierung rechnet mit steigenden fl\u00fcchtlingszahlen aus afghanistan ] ( http://m.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/a-1057336.html ) * english : [ government expects increasing numbers of refugees from afghanistan ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a//m.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/a-1057336.html ) [ roughly 210 million adults around the world would like to move to a country in the european union ] ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/124028/700-million-worldwide-desire-migrate-permanently.aspx ) and thats from 2009 ... http://www.ibtimes.com/europe-refugee-crisis-630000-refugees-entered-eu-illegally-frontex-chief-says-2126124 `` one thing is clear , the movement is not going to die down , '' said babar baloch , the u.n. refugee agency 's representative in the balkans , the associated press reported . 
  `` what we are seeing right now ... it 's just the tip of the iceberg . '', 
   this is bad extrapolation yes , it is . 
  i took the monthly number and extrapolated it to a year by multiply with 12 . 
  of course its very unlikely that the numbers stay constant linear over next 12 months . 
  but can you imagine what the results are when calculating the grow-factor august/september or 2014/2015 in ? 
  also any such grow-factor would be of course very unprecise cause of various factors like fluctuations , seasons , changing situations , etc. 
  so i just removed , ignored , the grow-factor completely and just assume linear numbers . 
  if you have a better idea how to extrapolate into the future , without being to much off the one or other way , then please say so . 
  thats what we are here for , to communicate with each other . 
  no reason to shame and blame for that . 
  just relax and give me some good arguments . 
  i listen :-), 
  and when 400.000 register then the total number is [ 800.000 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ob8ou/swedish_police_many_refugees_disappear_without/cvvqa00 ) in little bit over a month . 
  thats around 10 million a year assuming the numbers/day not continue to grow future . 
  well , that [ escalated quickly ] ( http://orig13.deviantart.net/01b8/f/2012/351/0/8/well_that_escalated_quickly_by_corey_chaos-d5od0xt.jpg ) . 
  thanks for the clarification . 
  then i agree with you on the main point . 
  of course `` not complying with orders '' is rather ... blur . 
  what if the order is `` stop , not continue climb over the fance '' and if thats ignored ? 
  then the officer needs to physical prevent this since its there job and thats when things get problematic i guess ... 
  the throwing of stones cases point into the direction that the officers are keeped on distance . 
  that written , do n't they have lesser drastical ways like ... water canons or something that does n't direct kill while still does the job to prevent people from entering ? 
  from your own source : `` under the border patrol 's use-of-force guidelines , agents are permitted to employ lethal force against rock throwers if they pose a threat . 
  large rocks have seriously injured many agents and many agents have resorted to wearing riot gear as a result . '', 
  that confirms op 's point that `` they certainly do and they have the right to use force if necessary '' . 
   every time they have anyway they 've been charged with human right abuses . 
  no , they have not . 
  read your source and follow there source [ 27 ] ( http://www.laprensa-sandiego.org/archieve/june16/analysis.htm ) which explicit writes that : `` human rights activists wonder why the press and people of conscience are not doing anything about the human rights violations '' there are no sources given for that statement . 
  its unclear which `` human rights activists '' are referred to . 
  its unclear what cases exactly are referenced . 
  its unclear who , beside the author , wonders about what . 
  its only clear that there are no charges ( as in yours `` everytime '' ) except for cases where indeed , human rights violation happened and a court found the agent guilty . 
  thats how it is , laws apply and courts are responsible to decide , not some random author who `` wonders '' in the name of unknown `` human rights activists '' . 
  there is another [ source ] ( http://forms.nomoredeaths.org/abuse-documentation/ ) which seems to be way better in assemling the situation . 
  they not seem to confirm your `` every time '' either ... do you happen to have a source that does confirm your opinion ? 
  emergency does n't deport , they are not the cops and are not required to call them or coperate with them except in very special cases . 
  attenting schools is indeed possible even when illegal . 
  schools are not the cops either . 
  i do think its very good , human , we allow both of this to happen . 
  half of the people not even bothering to register is a real issue and its shocking its so much . 
  it means that half of those entering not enter because of asylum or migration ... [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ob8ou/swedish_police_many_refugees_disappear_without/cvvqa00 ) nails it . 
  quotas ca n't work because they only can be applied to half of all `` refugees '' anyways . 
  only that half that does register . 
  i am more concerned about the other half . 
  my guess is that if you apply and get rejected and then caught later on its more difficult to get out again and continue selling drugs . 
  you could end being deported when caught . 
  if you not apply then you can just pretent to be in the process to apply forever ... how should anyone notice with no passport and no records ? 
   a feminist group was the driving force in the creation of the rape center source ? 
  according to the article s\u00f6dersjukhuset , the largest hospitals in stockholm , opened this . 
   would n't the muscle relaxant part prevent erection ? 
  ever woke up with a boner ? 
  you can sleep , completely passed out , and your dong works . 
  unfortunately opposite can happen too but thats another , unrelated , problem . 
  if `` muscle relaxing '' means no muscle works any longer at all you would stop breathing and be death . 
  it seems to be very much free speech with lefties and righties being allowed to communicate there views without some left/right sjw though-police censoring everything they not agree with . 
  of course in todays world some righties , lefties or other extremists may shocked that such places still exist and feel offended by reading things they not fully agree with . 
  so this communication-platform may not be the `` safe place '' you where looking for since you may find challenges questioning your views here . 
  trigger warning : divisive opinions . 
  not confirming op 's take that `` because of '' but like to point at two sources giving a bit more background about the world-wide , in particular asia , hitler cult : * https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/relations_between_nazi_germany_and_the_arab_world#arab_perceptions_of_hitler_and_nazism * http://www.cracked.com/quick-fixes/4-baffling-ways-continent-asia-loves-hitler/ not everywhere people assign hitler only with the holocaust . 
  its insane because the logistic to handle this numbers does not exist what is a direct consequence of politics of past years and result of how things where and are done right now . 
  `` riots '' are to a certain extend unavoidable but that so many `` agree with the why but not the how '' , the majority actually , is result of exactly these politics . 
  its cheap to blame the numbers ( `` evil terror migrants ! '' ), 
  or reactions ( `` all nazis ! '' ), 
  while the real issue is : merkel 's politics . 
  not the why but the how . 
  * http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/einwanderungsgesetz-quoten-punkte-sensationen-1.2585618 * http://www.cicero.de/berliner-republik/merkels-marschbefehl-wie-sich-die-kehrtwende-der-fluechtlingsfrage-erklaert/59822 point is trump takes valid critics voiced by many but then he slightly changes the focus making it sound like the migration and reactions are the problem while this are results of the real problem : politics of past years ( which continue right now unchanged , hey lets sell more weapons into syria ! ) . 
  of course its his agenda . 
  blaming others but not the politic that lead to all this since hes doing exactly the same merkel did past years : ignore , block , be surprised if things explode , panic reactions , be surprised again , blame others , continue . 
  if we would have applied the 2001 reforms , see first link above , and worked past years to a ) prevent implosion in middle east , b ) support countries who where left alone with the problems past years , c ) started this earlier and proper cherry picked candidates like us and canada do for example and d ) strechted the numbers over years rather then weeks then the whole situation would be very different . 
  thanks . 
  here a source which seems to confirm this : http://scienceline.org/2008/01/ask-stern-cannibal/ of course the question would be if this are significant numbers or more inline with other riscs we have to take when eating stuff . 
  i am left in doubts in particular about a comparision with todays [ fastfood ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/super_size_me ) . 
  that sounds like a sensible answer , thanks !, 
  and its bad news for human vegetarians ... 
  make the last answer `` 3 jobless on rocks '' . 
  sorry , failed to resits after reading the title and asking myself : and nobody eat each other during that trip ? 
  it depends . 
  do you voluntaire yourself ? 
  good move . 
  i find it hard that we not even try to prioritize . 
  families with kids should be reallocated to better places before the majority of single man in there 20-30 . 
  people complain about food ? 
  wait a week longer to learn the lesson that this is not a 5-star hotel . 
  these who get into fights , destroy properties , commit crimes should be deported to free resources needed for anybody else . 
  that looks way better then what army provided me while being forced to stay with them for a whole freaking year which was still better then some of the holes i had to life in during years of no-money student-times . 
  that place exists . 
  in tv , cinema , magazines and the internet . 
  all available channels that air our `` daily life '' into the world . 
  looks as the wife integrated faster then the husband into our society where its just quit normal that married people have no or very less sex . 
  somebody needs to explain it to the husband and explain him what stripclubs , beer and soccer are . 
  cats do actually taste rather good . 
  i never understood why people are fine to eat cows but not cats . 
  we should just eat what our surroundings has plenty off to fullfit mother nature . 
  if eating humans would be more acceptable we could solve hunger crisis from both ends .
