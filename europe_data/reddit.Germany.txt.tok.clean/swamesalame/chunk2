   profitable low skill jobs thats a point we passed long ago . 
  we have since some years now so called 1 euro jobs where workers are payed around 1 euro/hour . 
  of course its not profitable but thats not the point . 
  welfare is n't profitable either but thats not the point too . 
  its preventing social unrest with a growing number of people not being able to work to pay bills without composation payed by the system . 
  this is the kind of shift away from welfare to sponsored cheap labor market i am expecting to see growing . 
  of course it can not be a long-term solution . 
  but politics seldom thinks beyond next 4 years , ie a legislative period till next votings . 
   either higher taxes ( . . ) or reduction of social welfare both of course . 
  on top smaller wages e.g. 
  by adjusting the minimum wage down and/or introducing exceptions . 
  and there we identified the motives . 
  you have to also name the advantages : an increasing sector of cheap labor forces . 
  pretty sure someone will profit from that too . 
  welcome to europe : - /, 
   her `` mother theresa act '' , which is presented as the catalyst for this crisis there where many happenings past 15 years , or to be more precise past decades , that lead to the situation as-is . 
  the quoted s\u00fcssmuth-case is imho the most notable one because of the pure amount of very good steps combined with the long time till `` it hit us '' . 
  there where of course many more like heiligendamm 's fortress europe in 2007 , etc. 
  anyhow , memories are short and attention is drawn to bigbang-effects . 
  the named august happenings , which all happened months before already but only got confirmed official in august btw , fall in that category . 
  they of course are the strong messages that made it around the globe and did accelerate an already accelerating situation . 
   palestina girl causing a `` pr-hell '' search for `` merkel reem '' ( or an imagesearch for '' #merkelstreichelt '' for some lulz ) , the case draw even attention far outside of germany . 
  of course thats not the only reason too why merkel switched from her `` multiculti has failed '' to `` we can do it '' either . 
  the keywords are , and in case of merkel ever where , power , public opinions and agenda . 
  schroeder , our powerhorse before merkel , named her refugee-politics `` agenda 2020 '' for reasons . 
   a magnitude of the refugees would have come since beginning of the time . 
  but past decades , in europe , also in past years merkel politics , its was a matter of [ decreasing ] ( http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2006/10/352363.html ) the number of permanent migrants . 
  but again , when we look only at year 2015 we miss the big picture . 
  someone needs to look far beyond this year , in the past and future , to understand what is happening why . 
  the current situation is by no means unexpected . 
  is it planed ? 
  ask who profits , how `` germany '' benefits and draw the line . 
   source for the palestina girl and her family getting a permanent permit [ teenage asylum seeker who confronted merkel allowed to stay in germany ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/17/teenage-reem-asylum-seeker-merkel-tv-allowed-stay-germany ) . 
  thomas die misere : * `` so , we get 800.000 migrants this year ... '' * . 
  merkel : * `` we can do it !, 
  '' * gabriel : * `` we can do it every year !, 
  '' * all together : * `` dublin ii suspended '' * media and people : * `` welcome !, 
  '' * world watches , reports , praises , wonders , merkel nominated for nobel peace price , million people around the world got your message and accept the invitation and ( prepare to ) reallocate . 
  months later : * `` yeah , well , you understood it all totaly wrong . 
  now go again !, 
  '' * it is like it is . 
  accept the consequences and not shift germanys responsibilities to others , blame afghans , eastern europe and greece . 
  eat your dogfood now . 
  meanwhile i buy more popcorn to watch the newest sommerm\u00e4rchen . 
  you guys put us in deep shit once more and now its on people like me to enjoy the show :-), 
  thanks for the sources !, 
  the case , merkels responbility for the current situation , goes [ back to 2001 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3urmjd/hundreds_involved_in_mass_brawl_at_berlin_refugee/cxhtvqd ) . 
  greetings . 
   and how come the german federal agency for asylum already projected 800,000 asylum seekers for 2015 two weeks before she started all that ? 
  because they did n't and you made it up . 
  prove me wrong and give a source . 
   no reasonable candidate its even more worse . 
  the alternates are gigantic failures like ttip-gabriel or g36-zensursula . 
  before that happens even i would vote for merkel . 
  for example [ spiegel : bye bye merkel doctrine : german foreign policy shifts focus to refugees ] ( http://m.spiegel.de/international/germany/a-1062116.html ) * with the refugee crisis showing no signs of abating , germany is rapidly changing its foreign and security policy focus . 
  gone are the days of democracy promotion . 
  now the primary goal is that of preventing people from migrating to europe . 
  money , same like with turkey . 
   she clarified source ? 
  if you did n't realize merkel turned into the [ mother of all refugees ] ( http://m.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/a-1057336.html ) and is a world-wide hero among these who like to reallocate . 
  we know since months that migrantion , also from afghanista , is accelerating rapid as result . 
  this is cause by : * merkels announcement that 800.000 will be accepted . 
  it turned , in case of afghanistan , into at least 800.000 afghani will be accepted . 
  * dublin-ii was suspended what turned , in case of afghanistan , into dublin was suspended for the afghani people to allow to resettle direct to germany . 
  * same goes for e.g. 
  you only saw the [ tip of the iceberg ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/25/eu-refugee-crisis-tip-of-iceberg-unhcr ) yet dear germany . 
  way [ more ] ( http://www.zeit.de/2015/45/migration-fluechtlinge-grenzen-grenzsicherung-interview ) are coming and your gov continues to lose time with pseudo-actions . 
  problems are more that over 80 % arrive without papers . 
  when deporting some of the 20 % its also likely that many just go underground and vanish . 
  so , we are talking here of a very small percentage who will be deported . 
  and of course way lesser will be deported then arrive new each day . 
  sorry , its not a solution . 
  its only an illusion to spread the impression something is done , things are under control . 
  just more time lost . 
  yeah , looks as we improved since the turkey-deal and pay now before announcements :-), 
  i find it rather hard to believe that taken [ this ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/01/world/europe/how-the-paris-attackers-honed-their-assault-through-trial-and-error.html?_r=1 ) into account . 
  i mean serious ? 
  wtf ? 
   lawyers and judges who are trained to look for cultural traits and regional dialects rofl . 
  lets also solve hunger crisis and stop wars forever while on it . 
  ca n't be that hard too . 
   i 'm pretty sure i read an article explaining this * http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/15/eu-states-migrant-rescue-operations-mediterranean * http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/20/eu-italian-proposals-outsource-mediterranean-migrant-patrol-africa the dirty parts are outsourced , in spirit of the gaddafi deal : * http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/01/eu-muammar-gaddafi-immigration * http://www.theweek.co.uk/6515/how-libya-kept-migrants-out-of-eu-at-any-cost * http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/05/european-commission-third-country-immigrant-processing-centres, 
  of course . 
  why should it be different then with our secret services who get billions to blow on mass-survilance while unable to monitor some hundred extremists ? 
   acceptible damage taken how fast otherwise unacceptable steps are applied and justified using that damage it seems more that for politicans its a [ welcome opportunity ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20151119-fears-french-style-usa-patriot-act-following-paris-attacks-terrorism-constitution ) . 
   and we have resettled 38,500 syrian refugees from refugee camps in 2013 already . 
  probably i should leave it at `` what can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence '' but ... 1 . 
  its 30000 for 2013 +2014 and the slots are not fully used 2 . 
  its not necessarly from camps 3 . 
  its not necessarly from syria 4 . 
  its still necessary to apply in germany ( as per law ) 5 . 
  its only for family-members of germans 6 . 
  more conditions apply sources : * [ proasyl ] ( http://www.proasyl.de/de/home/syrien/ ) * [ bamf ] ( http://www.bamf.de/de/migration/aufnahmesyrien/aufnahmeverfahren-syrien-node.html ) please give sources what also makes sure you did research rather then guess . 
  thanks . 
  in short : merkel politics . 
  in long : since over 15 years we know this situation is coming . 
  thats why in 2001 the schroeder , before merkel , government came up with the [ s\u00fcssmuth bericht ] ( http://www.bmi.bund.de/cae/servlet/contentblob/123148/publicationfile/9076/zuwanderungsbericht_pdf.pdf ) . 
  this was a set of very clever asylum-reforms aligned to canada and us ( point-system ) , included european solutions ( quotas but in a different way then we got them forced through now ) , integration , work , investment , housing , etc. 
  and also such an external solution to apply for and progress visas/asylum outside of germany ( page 181 ) . 
  this set of reforms made it into a new law .
