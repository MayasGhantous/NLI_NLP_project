  that law was about to pass in 2001 . 
  the majority of votes did vote for `` yes '' but due to a first-time used very questionable strategy prevented by [ angela merkel ] ( http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/einwanderungsgesetz-quoten-punkte-sensationen-1.2585618 ) herself . 
  this was one of her steps to kill of competition within her own party , damage the government , secure power and influence and it worked out : she took over government after schroeder ever since then . 
  the law was killed , the topic closed behind doors in a dark room and all [ warnings of experts ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=t02b2rqxkmo ) got ignored for 15 long years . 
  a young palestina child cried in front of merkel cause she was about to be deported . 
  life on camera . 
  merkel , as she is , acted cold , answered `` we can not do it '' and pr-hell did break lose . 
  she lost a few public opinion points over that and ... changed strategy from `` we can not do it '' to `` we can do it '' . 
  the palestina child , and her parents , got permanent permit , the since years going on syrian civilwar was discovered and medial sold , doors opened , etc. 
  and she did win public opinion points . 
  unfortunately she did a huge mistake , one she always prevented to do in the past learning well from her mentor , the dark sith helmut kohl , and turning his to-the-point politics into flexible-soap-politics : she assigned herself with that decision . 
  in the past she would never do that to keep the option to backtrack any time when public opinion shifts . 
  this time , the first time ever , she did it all herself . 
  there is nobody else , nobody she could `` volles vertrauen aussprechen '' ( pawn sacrifice ) and backtrack . 
  also the situation developed such rapid that her usual strategy , waiting and doing nothing till last minute , did worked against her up to the point that just reversing was n't possible any longer . 
  so , now she tries full speed to limit damage while keeping face/votes . 
  fences ( in turkey ) , more fences ( around europe ) , push problems to someone else like europe ( forced quota ) , so called `` service-centers '' at the european border to prevent income , more frontex , etc. 
  and we still have no long-term solution . 
  the s\u00fcssmuth-bericht and its associated law are still closed down in that dark room due to her political strategies . 
  our , germany 's , el presidente in 2001 the johannes rau wrote a rather good [ statement ] ( http://www.bundespraesident.de/shareddocs/reden/de/johannes-rau/reden/2002/06/20020620_rede.html?nn=1951762 ) about this , merkels , strategy and the huge damage she did there . 
  who would have guessed that 15 years later one of her many steps to break the previous government , competition within her own party and take over the power would have had such huge negative effects ? 
  and even if , would that have changed anything if it gained the desired decision-maker-mutant-antihero-turtle powers ? 
  do not underestimate her . 
  she would let someone push the red button if it gains some public opinion points and eat that someone afterwards if opinions shifts . 
  they do n't need to because canada is clever & smart and opened a [ refugee processing centre in jordan ] ( http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/ministers-refugee-processing-centre-jordan-1.3342699 ) . 
  they do all the processings , background checks , prepare ( housing , paperwork , visa , etc ) there and then transport whole selected families to canada . 
  pretty sure one day even us , dick & doof , will realize that this is the proper way . 
  meanwhile : who comes first , survives the trip , is willing to leave family behind , sell everything to pay smugglers , is willing to arrive illegal , send only there strongest males : welcome to our burning mass-brawl tent-colloseum . 
  beware of the lions and smile into the cameras . 
  what you may have missed is that this is a very tiny minority expressing themself using violence . 
  the big majority does n't do this . 
  do n't try to justify some peoples behavior away by attributing there clusterf * ck on everybody who there is . 
  thats relevant because those who not do that , the normal people , suffer most right now by the actions of those violant minority who does that .

  its cocaine otherwise they would n't care whats going on . 
  both , religion and ideology , are used to group . 
  in reality its about interests , power , influence . 
  thats why there are hundred of groups fighting each other and why we are in too . 
   isis is already being demonized by the news . 
  really ? 
  i received it similar to amok-cases : pure heroism . 
  media reports about every aspect , dives deep into the person , the `` reasons '' . 
  a huge stage to spread the committers `` message '' . 
  someone like isis is turned into a famous boygroup , our media are fans , groupies and there ideals actions are rewarded by unbelievable lot attention .

  you actually have to follow specific rules , not present in the west , in many islamic countries due to there laws . 
  try walking around as male without t-shirt in saudi arabia or do one of the [ eleven things women in saudi arabia can not do ] ( http://www.theweek.co.uk/60339/eleven-things-women-in-saudi-arabia-cannot-do ) to figure out . 
   let 's just say it turned out badly . 
  source ? 
  from various official [ sources ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/niq\u0101b#iran ) this actually worked very well for iran . 
  correct . 
  '' [ the niqab is a cultural tradition and has nothing to do with islam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/niq\u0101b#criticism ) '' . 
  see also [ views among muslim scholars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/niq\u0101b#niqab_in_islam ) . 
  the niqab is usually passed on to the daughters in very young age with a set of other rules that do force separation from society to some degree . 
  we have many laws , like e.g. 
  compulsory school attendance and school dressing code ( in some countries ) , limiting parents in there infinite power over there children . 
  not necessarly a bad thing in interest of our common society and the children themself . 
   fights a terrorist insurgency nobody cares about sufferings of terrorists . 
  its the suffering of civilians that matters . 
  unfortunately ypg is another such group that brings such sufferings to civilians . 
  its that today , with all these in the civilwar participating interest-groups , [ there are no good guys ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/syria-s-moderates-have-disappeared-and-there-are-no-good-guys-a6679406.html ) left and civilans suffer . 
  this ( proxy - ) war needs to stop . 
   one of the signatories read the article . 
  she visited bush in person . 
  that `` open letter '' was another followup . 
  and her statement that `` military actions should never be questioned '' is hardcore . 
  other such cases include but are not limited to : * http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/einwanderungsgesetz-quoten-punkte-sensationen-1.2585618 * http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/17/angela-merkel-german-multiculturalism-failed * http://www.cicero.de/berliner-republik/merkels-marschbefehl-wie-sich-die-kehrtwende-der-fluechtlingsfrage-erklaert/59822  complete silence yes , her strategy of doing nothing as long as possible is another big problem .

   97 % of dead doctors and medical workers are attributed to assad note thaf phr [ stopped ] ( https://s3.amazonaws.com/phr_syria_map/web/index.html ) counting in 2013 and isis [ started to focus ] ( http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/in-recent-months-isis-targeted-hospitals-doctors-journalists/ ) on doctors , medical personal , hospitals , journalists , etc. 
  in syria only end of 2013 when they controlled larger parts of syria . 
   unicef regularly says assad tortures children in their prisons . 
  what [ unicef did say ] ( http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/content/unicef-400-children-killed-11-months-violence-syria ) is : * at least 400 children have been killed in 11 months of violence in syria and almost the same number detained * its only about the first 11 months in this 5 years long civilwar and who killed , detained is n't future broken down by unicef . 
  also seems there are no newer numbers given by them . 
  probably because its not only difficult to count who did what but to count at all . 
   none of the rebels in syria are moderate [ syria 's ` moderates ' have disappeared ... and there are no good guys ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/syria-s-moderates-have-disappeared-and-there-are-no-good-guys-a6679406.html ), 
   violations of human rights and conduct of war [ amnesty ] ( https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/10/syria-us-allys-razing-of-villages-amounts-to-war-crimes/ ) names it warcrimes , co-ordinated campaign of collective punishment of civilians . 
  arbitrary arrests , unlawful detainsions , burning houses down , etc. 
  according to the article its systematic large scale but indeed not limited to specific ethnics cause it hits all kind of civilians . 
  merkel was actually supporting the iraqi-war for example and , when in power back then , would have send german troops . 
  she even meet up with bush to bad mounth the german government back then for not going full war . 
  one of her many big scandals people forgot about . 
  damn humans ruining earth for us reddits . 
  fify :-), 
   all terrorists are humans agree there . 
  the world would be way more human without humans . 
  blaming someone else for own failures is an easy way to shift responsibilties . 
  particular those people blaming hungary , greece , russia , ... , everybody but themself , most are those who suffer most at the end whats then seen as confirmation .
