  one result is op 's point that :  europe has asked for huge cuts in our budgets what results then in the question how to fund `` union problems '' when the same union , well some countries within it , spreads austerity . 
  this question is valid far beyond the current military case but also applied , for example , at past years handling of refugees/migrations where the south ( specially greece and italy ) was left alone funding a solution to an european problem while at the same time got fiscal waterboarded ( specially greece ) by that same `` union '' making the problem more worse . 
  its not working and we need a new deal . 
  either close the euro chapter or expand the union from currency to decision making including proper democratic processes . 
   but first ask `` europe '' whether the other 28 member states see things the same way . 
  says the german :-)  that for example the states at the eastern flank have other views do there views matter now to europe ? 
  just wondering when it changed . 
  nice [ guardian article ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/03/us-isis-syria-iraq ) covering the situation . 
  i think we agree that `` deash is just the symptom '' . 
  the point is in `` another group would have filled this position '' . 
  there was only a position to fill because of us . 
  i doubt anyone , without interests in destabilized syria , thinks the current situation is better then it was the 45 years of assad regime before the , our , invasion . 
  syria used to be a raising power . 
  damascus was center of science , education and a secular socity . 
  now its a place to die . 
  its exactly not `` assad is the cause '' this changed . 
  its us destabilizing syria like we did with iraqi and afghanistan and isis is in [ lybia ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_state_of_iraq_and_the_levant_in_libya ) too now and guess who did a [ military intervention ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_military_intervention_in_libya ) in lybia against gaddafi before ... we have now 4 such countries and its always the [ same pattern ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/tony-blair-s-acceptance-that-the-iraq-war-facilitated-rise-of-isis-is-a-first-step-to-acknowledging-a6708421.html ) . 
  do n't you think we should just stop doing that ? 
   your problem is using wikipedia as your source [ asiannews ] ( http://m.asianews.it/index.php?art=28219&amp;l=en ) : * syrian observatory for human rights ( sohr ) , an organisation set up by syrian rebels in exile . 
  [ ... ] for nearly two years , sohr has reported only acts of violence by the regime against the rebels . 
  [ ... ] sohr continues to defend islamic extremists * [ the guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/12/syrian-opposition-doing-the-talking ) : * that name , the `` syrian observatory of human rights '' , sound so grand , so unimpeachable , so objective . 
  and yet when abdulrahman and his `` britain-based ngo '' ( afp/now lebanon ) are the sole source for so many news stories about such an important subject , it would seem reasonable to submit this body to a little more scrutiny than it 's had to date . 
  * [ global security news ] ( http://global-security-news.com/2012/06/09/syria-major-media-outlets-shaming-themselves-over-syrian-observatory-for-human-rights/ ) : * the syrian observatory for human rights is none of these things . 
  instead , it is merely a single man , sitting behind a computer in a british apartment , who alleges he receives `` phone calls '' with information always incriminating the syrian government * [ reuters ] ( http://uk.mobile.reuters.com/article/iduktre7b71xg20111208?irpc=932 ) : * `` i came to britain the day hafez al-assad died , and i 'll return when bashar al-assad goes , '' abdulrahman said * * some of abdulrahman 's family refuse to speak to him , supporting assad out of what he said was fear or ignorance . 
  * * one of his brothers has pictures of news outlets , which have featured negative coverage of assad , on his floor to walk on in a sign of disprespect , abdulrahman said , laughing . 
  * [ al-akhbar ] ( http://www.webcitation.org/6syiswgfc ) : * abdulrahman told al-akhbar that some members of the syrian opposition are waging a war against him due to his own opposition to nato intervention * * as of january 24 , abdulrahman 's group puts the the number of dead at 4,382 civilians and 1,617 military ( regular military , security members and defectors ) excluding those who died in the damacus and kfar sousa bombings or in hama between august 3 and 10 of last year . 
  of the various groups cataloguing this information , this is one of the lower overall figures , but they have recorded higher numbers of casualties for the military . 
  azzawi 's group ( as of january 14 ) claimed 5,746 civilians plus 529 military ( `` regardless their loyalty '' ) had been killed . 
  *  sohr is very well connected in syria that abdulrahman , real name [ osama ali suleiman ] ( https://priapusdionysis.wordpress.com/2013/04/09/rami-abdulrahman-muslim-brotherhood-and-human-rights-observatory/ ) , receives all his infos via phone from syria , cause he was n't once in syria since over 13 years when he illegal immigrated into the uk , is and ever was an unproven claim . 
  even the un stopped to differ in countings between civilians , forces and the hundred of groups because `` its not possible to accurate differ '' . 
  [ read up ] ( https://syrianfreepress.wordpress.com/2012/02/01/syrian-observatory-for-human-rights-a-useful-fake-for-false-propaganda/ ) about him and his one-man show , the sohr `` organization '' . 
   the reliability of sohr reports varies you mean like [ his claim ] ( https://nocheinparteibuch.wordpress.com/2011/08/08/brutkastenluge-von-cnn-und-rami-abdul-rahman-syrian-observatory-for-human-rights-entlarvt/ ) that assad forces killed incubator-babies in hospitals ? 
  sounds familar ? 
  probably because we got the exact same story from the hill & knowlton pr-company at the beginning of the iraq-war . 
  of course this new story was [ proven a lie ] ( https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/how-cnn-helped-spread-hoax-about-syrian-babies-dying-incubators ) too . 
   fsa they are not more . 
  most joined al-nustra/al-qaeda , isis , assad or left syria . 
  the only moderate and secular forces where never supported by the west as promised and literally fighting with nails on a wooden board against billion dollar extremists with tanks . 
  we f * cked that up too . 
  * http://www.ibtimes.com/four-years-later-free-syrian-army-has-collapsed-1847116 * http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/syria-s-moderates-have-disappeared-and-there-are-no-good-guys-a6679406.html  if we go in with the plan [ ... ] we will create a new isis exactly : - /, 
   not actually my country especially your country . 
   there is a concern about nations in non-stable locations having nukes thats why nations like to have nukes . 
  it makes sure other nations work to keep your nation stable rather then opposite . 
   and to everyone in the middls east being murdered ? 
  thats whats happening right now and why many flee . 
  this was n't the case before war-on-terror at afghanistan , iraq , syria which all collapse into fail states as result . 
   how about when isis takes baghdad ? 
  would n't have happened without saddam being replaced with a power vacuum . 
  do you think it will be different if in syria once we replaced assad with a power vacuum ? 
  afghanistan is rapid collapsing right now too and may next on the isis-list . 
   this is n't a nation state you are dealing with no , its a caliphate and they expand rapid . 
  everytime we mess around in a country they take over whats left . 
  where `` they '' refers not specific to al qaeda , al nusra , isis , etc. 
  but extremists bloody taking over . 
   nation state tactics it makes no diff . 
  same at vietnam , iraq , afghanistan , syria and soon probably lybia : mess around , lose huge . 
  read your link at least . 
  250.000 syrians died in total and not by assad . 
  the whole article is rather bad journalism . 
  here :  between january and july , assad 's military and pro-government militias killed 7,894 people , while the islamic state killed 1,131 there are hundred of groups and this compares assad and all pro-gov groups ( including shia militias from iraq and hizbullah fighters ) with only isis ? 
  and that only during a 6 month period ? 
  9000 death in 6 months , so whats with all the other death people in that 6 month to reach 250.000 in 4 years ? 
  ohhhh ... 
  but it gets better , the source for that claim is :  according to the syrian network for human rights , a monitoring group based in britain . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/syrian_observatory_for_human_rights `` the united kingdom-based sohr is run out of a two-bedroom terraced home in coventry by one person , rami abdulrahman , [ 3 ] a syrian sunni muslim who also runs a clothes shop '' hahahahahaha . 
  read up on that `` source '' . 
  hes a known islam extremist and isis supporter . 
  wtf is going on with washington post ? 
  since when do they write such bad articles ? 
   assad is the cause and deash destabilizing iraq , syria , afghanistan , leaving power vacuums and chaos are the cause . 
  guess who is reponsible for that . 
  you can war on different levels . 
  financial by pressing every single of the 40 countries doing business with isis , eg oil and drugs , to stop doing so . 
  political isolating isis and building a world-wide anti-isis front . 
  this absolute needs to include islamic countries , assad and russia . 
  medial by stop reporting about them , stop giving them a world-wide stage to reward there actions . 
  start supporting moderate muslims , hunt down the extremists , learn to differ political , medial and in actions . 
  bring the f * cking syrian civilwar to an end , stop proxywars , stop messing around in middle east . 
   that 's why it is so difficult to prosecute radicalism , it can also be abused to prosecute people critical of islam . 
  if the critic of islam is as radical , `` kill them all '' , then whats the problem ? 
  we are talking here about a level of radical that denies others there existence , that denies laws and human rights in favor of there `` own laws '' . 
  this kind of radicals are what we call [ verfassungswidrigkeit ] ( https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/verfassungswidrigkeit ) and not different from other movements , like criminal mafias or radical right-wings , we prohibited and slashed down . 
   assad chemical attacks [ assad did not order syria chemical weapons attack ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/08/syria-chemical-weapons-not-assad-bild ) . 
  do n't fall again for the iraqi weapons of massdestruction pr . 
  also [ west ignored russian offer in 2012 to have syria 's assad step aside ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/15/west-ignored-russian-offer-in-2012-to-have-syrias-assad-step-aside ) . 
  isis is financed by 40 countries [ including g20 members ] ( https://www.rt.com/news/322305-isis-financed-40-countries/ ) and is the result of georg bush 's [ war on terror ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/03/us-isis-syria-iraq ) . 
   why ca n't groups unite under assad and against the islamists because each of the [ hundred of groups ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_armed_groups_in_the_syrian_civil_war ) every group has very own interests . 
  even `` the islamists '' ca n't unite . 
  isis declared war against taliban just [ a month ago ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/608187/islamic-state-isis-war-taliban-afghanistan ) . 
  there are not two fronts , there are hundred of fronts . 
  groups , warlords , wild wild west , everyone against everyone , civil war . 
  syrian democratic forces , ypg , a pkk-branch , labeled by turkey , us and eu as terrorist group , accussed by amnesty international of warcrimes on civilians . 
  * http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/13/us-backed-kurdish-forces-committing-war-crimes-against-syrian-civilians * http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/10/syria-turkey-right-groups-accused-kurds-rojava-of-war-crimes.html * https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2015/10/syria-us-allys-razing-of-villages-amounts-to-war-crimes/, 
  because the un refugee convention is probably as incompatible like the [ declaration of human rights ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/cairo_declaration_on_human_rights_in_islam ) ? 
  police + services where maybe to busy [ monitoring the masses ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/05/france-passes-new-surveillance-law-in-wake-of-charlie-hebdo-attack ) and had no time + resources to follow up on specific warnings ? 
   merkel , just as anyone else she is n't anyone else and her famous leaked talk with zuckerberg was as cancelor of germany . 
  same goes with heiko mass , our minister of justice , who talked in his role as minister of justice .
