  this is illegal ( once gg # 20 is finally applied , hint for students ) . 
  the don corleone way of `` i 'm gon na make him an offer he ca n't refuse '' is force because its don corleone and refusing the offer has effects . 
  everybody knows that refusing an `` offer '' from merkel and mass has effects - see the guardian article . 
  so , what , facebook bends in and mass gives a `` flexible list '' with topics they censor next . 
  great , one step closer to [ `` better protect personal rights in the internet '' ] ( http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/umstrittenes-gesetz-tuerkei-weitet-internet-kontrolle-drastisch-aus-1.1880974 ) or a local variant of the [ `` deutscher provider unterst\u00fctzt russische zensur im ausland '' ] ( http://www.golem.de/news/reporter-ohne-grenzen-deutscher-provider-unterstuetzt-russische-zensur-im-ausland-1408-108452.html ) ( non - ) scandal . 
  mass and merkel . 
  vorratsdatenspeicherung and bka survilance . 
  next : install censor taskforces in private companies . 
  wtf ? 
   kanzler can urge people to not commit crimes . 
  ** if ** crimes are committet then our judicative and executive take over . 
  our system was explicit build to prevent the legislative from taking `` she short path '' and that is so to protect [ us ] ( https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/artikel_20_des_grundgesetzes_f\u00fcr_die_bundesrepublik_deutschland#absatz_2 ) . 
   the ministry of justice can build task force on why crimes arent prosecuted its the job of the [ judicative ] ( https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/judikative ) to decide if crimes are committed and only them !, 
  the executive forces these . 
  these separation of powers is essential and our legislative is per law bound to it . 
  cases like the recent [ intervention ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/german-prosecutor-says-justice-ministry-hindering-treason-investigation-of-journalists-1438690717 ) of our minister of justice into the judicative are for very good reasons limited and need to be questioned every single time . 
  why is it so hard to understand that merkel , that the legislative , needs to stay out of this . 
  our laws are very clear on that and its the base our [ rechtsstaat ] ( https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/rechtsstaatsprinzip ) is build up on . 
  they even do disallow our legislative to write laws for single cases , like facebook now or like google before . 
  its prohibited and there are no buts , whens and ifs . 
  our legislative needs to follow ... [ our ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gg/art_92.html ) ... [ laws ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gg/art_97.html ) ... read up christoph kappes great article about [ facebook & hass : ma\u00dfnahmen , verantwortung und ein l\u00f6sungsversuch ] ( http://christophkappes.de/facebook-hass-massnahmen-verantwortung-und-ein-loesungsversuch/ ) for more insights . 
  ** if ** thats the case then what are we discussing ? 
  there are plenty ways for our judicative and executive to apply laws . 
  following sentence from the guardian article is what makes me curious : * the german chancellor , angela merkel , urged facebook to do more this year on the matter , while the country 's justice ministry wants to set up a taskforce with the company * its ** not ** the legislative , ie politicans , job . 
  we have separation of powers ( gewaltenteilung ) for very good reasons . 
  this is a clear violation and needs to be rejected . 
  volksverhetzung is covered by law and as such , if ruled by a court , facebook needs to remove this ( and that is good so ) . 
  but the guardian article names `` racist comments '' , '' hate speech '' and `` xenophobic comments '' . 
  the german-based managing director of facebook says `` there has been no violation of german law by facebook '' . 
  so what should be removed here ? 
  if its illegal , like volksverhetzung , then sue the money out of them , throw them into a prision , etc. 
  use all the force to execute laws . 
  but if its not covered by law ( and right now it looks so ) ? 
  then something is very wrong here and its not facebook doing the wrong not playing willing censor for opinions that are lawful , not prohibited , some would even saw protected by freedom of speech . 
  law needs to apply . 
  for everybody . 
  also and especially for our government . 
  if law does not cover it then try to change the law . 
  but do not , never , force others , instrument then , to build up an unlawful censor-system that may now used for racists comments and tomorrow for politicial critics . 
  the whole thing stinks . 
  haha , what a great job he did . 
  near impossible to tell the difference between chemical and comical ali :-), 
  she seems to control herself well to not burst in laught and roflcopter around while reading such statements . 
  [ chemical ali ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ali_hassan_al-majid ) `` was sentenced to death for the fourth time on 17 january 2010 and was hanged eight days later , on 25 january 2010 . '', 
  it changes with age and experience . 
  you are just a bit ahead others your age . 
  i wonder why ? 
  oh yeah ... * http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/03/us-isis-syria-iraq war on terror in middle east seemed to work as well as war on drugs in mexico ...

  more worse then that . 
  development aid is drastical cut future to finance europeas refugee adventure . 
   the largest single economy in the eu has the largest influence for a single country ? 
  no , that is to be expected . 
  and thats a huge part of the problem since as you wrote yourself :  germany looks out for both its allies and its own self interest - it 's difficult to keep the balance right . 
  as it is now there are no mechanism to keep europeas interests balanced . 
  its always germanys interests who weight more in then anybody else interest . 
  thats a serious problem and a reason the eu is in such a bad shape . 
  what we need is to proper balance interests and find working consensus . 
  the way quotas was forced through is not how broad agreement , how an union should or can work . 
   syrian passport -  process * [ migrants buy fake syrian passports for asylum ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/migration-fake-syrian-passports-asylum-request-frontex/ ) * [ fake syrian passport market is booming ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/fake-syrian-passport-market-is-booming-2015-9 ) * [ 1/3 has fake syrian ids ] ( https://www.rt.com/news/316570-eu-false-syrian-refugees/ ) its just one more service provided by smugglers making the business even more lucrative . 
   `` syrian '' , no passport , speaks arabic -  please wait in this group housing until nationality can be determined . 
  how can it ever be determinated ? 
  if it can not it means no evidence , no way to deport and since in already its https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/duldung_ ( aufenthaltsrecht ) in worst case . 
  she knows since at least 15 years , since 2001 , and worked hard all the time to prevent any solution .

   syrians we do n't know how much who enter are really syrians . 
  we only know 80 % enter without passports . 
  we also know there is a lucrative market for syrian passports . 
  we know that majority claims to be syrian . 
  we know we can not verify this claims . 
  we know too that our governement has no idea how much people really entered since its still uncontrolled chaos . 
   weeks before her invitation the federal agency for migration and refugees already estimated that 800,000 people will enter germany in 2015 source ? 
  asking because its logical wrong . 
  the 800.000 estimate was adjusted only very rejecently end of august . 
  before it was 400.000 and before 200.000 and before ... 
  a better , more balanced , [ source ] ( http://eulawanalysis.blogspot.com/2015/09/relocation-of-asylum-seekers-in-eu-law.html ) with more details . 
  for doubts : this are `` laws '' / `` binding agreements '' / ... of course are there many questions how they apply at cases . 
  more so since we never had the situation before . 
  its not even clear to what degree this `` decisions '' are binding , if they are in conflict with other `` laws '' / `` agreements '' / ... thats why we have courts and its there job to sort this out . 
  also , as i wrote before already , it could as well be a legal strategy to delay in which case the result does n't even matter . 
   79 ( 5 ) only is an exception for article 79 , not 78 and grass is green !, 
  serious ... article 78 and 79 used to be both under article 63 . 
  the both articles where grouped as 1-2 and 3-4 . 
  its written direct under the article numbers !, 
  the 79 ( 5 ) exception applies to work and as such includes working asylum-seekers ( see my previous comment why thats relevant ) . 
   visas this is hard . 
  visas is a so unrelated topic that its not named once anywhere for good reasons . 
  we talk about migration here . 
  not visa , mastercard and bitcoins . 
  you not need a visa to work . 
  you need a work-permit . 
  a working visa is a visa with work permit . 
  there are big differences between those . 
   the people under the quotas are n't coming from third countries , they 're coming from eu members . 
  your take is that because you pass a country you turn from third-country national into local and/or not come from the third country but from that country you passed now in context of quotas ? 
  sounds like an interesting interpretation . 
  i would n't agree but luckely i not have to . 
  we have courts to sort such things out :-),
