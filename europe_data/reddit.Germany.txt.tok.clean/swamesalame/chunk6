  article 79 tfeu : * 5 . this article shall not affect the right of member states to determine volumes of admission of third-country nationals coming from third countries to their territory in order to seek work , whether employed or self-employed . 
  * that means article 72 can only apply if asylum-seekers a ) not , never work and b ) the quota only applies provisional , temporary . 
  as far as the intro goes europe will have to pay a ) while b ) is indeed a problem since after some time , 1-2 years i assume , 72 ( 3 ) can not apply any more else its permanent , whats not covered by 72 ( 3 ) , and then ? 
  solving the doubts now , in front of a court , sounds like a sensible decision . 
  i am also sure there are various tricks someone could use to either infinite delay or use a loophole to bypass . 
  where demand there ways . 
  and its not slovakia whos in a hurry here . 
  [ this reddit ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ny9or/merkel_slams_eastern_europeans_on_migration/ ) for example where yourself even defended her in the comments for slaming all of eastern europe . 
  that was only 1 month ago . 
  remember it ? 
  here some more sources just in case : * http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/angela-merkel/11919548/angela-merkel-attacks-east-european-leaders-for-ignoring-their-past-over-refugees.html * http://www.politico.eu/article/merkel-eu-needs-to-consider-treaty-change/ * http://mobile.reuters.com/article/iduskcn0s211o20151008 more at google . 
  the first pages are full when just searching for `` merkel eastern europe '' . 
  same for '' merkel greece '' , `` merkel russia '' , and so on . 
  the blame game is a constant pattern of her throughout all the years . 
  there is nobody who is n't guilty if things went wrong , and a lot went wrong , except herself of course . 
  everybody knows that enjoying her attention ( `` volles vertrauen '' formally known as `` bauernopfer '' ) equals death penality . 
  and of course is our massmedia part of the system merkel . 
  not that different from how it worked for berlusconi : * https://bilddung.wordpress.com/2014/08/22/merkelwurdige-kaffeetanten-regieren-unser-land/, 
  its a blame game . 
  our gov needs someone else to blame and we ca n't take greece again , or blame russia for that too , so its eastern europe this time . 
   is it because of their economy ? 
  yes , we are using that and the financial weight within europe . 
  the european institution is mainly germany at this point . 
  but we often enough get some other countries , like france , on our side to play the `` its an european solution '' card . 
  just like war but financial rather then military where the strongest rules the house . 
  remember your grandparents warning you from the germans ? 
  its true . 
  germans fear them , our gov , too . 
  look what mess we are in . 
  and that was only one german , merkel . 
  imagine you have millions of them . 
  around you . 
  all day !, 
  point is the current conditions are unhealthy for a common europe . 
  an europe with mainly one party controlling the structure can not and does not work . 
  we need a new deal for europe in best interest of all of europe . 
  uk is our last hope for bigger changes absolute needed . 
  the war was going on for 4 years before the merkel happening . 
  there are all kind of wars going on since forever . 
   it is about helping peple  how is funneling everybody into germany a solution for germany ? 
  its you who like to help people by mass migrating them into your country . 
  others think this is the wrong way to help them . 
  you picked your way , thats your solution for germany . 
  the problem at hand is that the migration will not stop . 
  it needs to be stopped . 
  thats the first and main step . 
  thats the job of the merkel-government . 
  once they did there job we can talk again . 
  meanwhile have fun with your problem at hand your own . 
   i 'm amazed the german chanchelor shows her disgust for the german people . 
  i am not . 
  its how many germans see the country and work done by there parents and grandparents that gave them education , healthcare , jobs , warfree times , wealth . 
  many not realize how great of a deal that is and thats why you see so less defending this to keep it present for future generations . 
  the understanding of a flag as symbol for that or even a basic understanding to value what you got to pass it on is not present at all . 
  merkel just does the same the average german does . 
  no respect , do not care what comes after me , do not care what i got , lets screw it . 
  its the 70 ' disinterest combined with missing knowledge how things are outside and a strong believe things are given , not going to change depending on your actions . 
  buy popcorn and watch fate teaching an ignorant socity . 
  eu countries , and in particular germany , needs skilled workers . 
  not more cheap labour with low income . 
  germany used to wall itself rather successfully in the past . 
  they did n't had much experience with larger numbers of migrations yet . 
  thats why many ride on to compare the current situation to the working migration of turks decades ago not realizing any differences . 
  every country needs to collect its own experiences there . 
   most mass immigration waves in history have been successful in integrating and it took generations , every single time . 
  as was written above :  the costs of this migration situation will be paid over the course of the twenty-first century . 
  that task is n't going away for generations to come . 
  note how the linked report only names housing and education for 2015 . 
  the same ifo-institute estimated the total spendings to be around 40-50 billion a year . 
  and after the golf read up [ some ] ( http://m.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/a-1061993.html ) [ sources ] ( https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/asyldebatte#ausl.c3.a4nder-_und_asylpolitische_kontroversen_1982_bis_1986 ) for the context of `` unkontrollierte massenimmigration '' ( uncontrolled mass-migration ) - or golf more and blame others . 
   did n't we just agree , that it 's not uncontrolled ? 
  sounds like you qualify for a leading position in our government :-)  from what i get , the german government is far from claiming that there is n't a problem . 
  there is no problem but we are not claiming there is no problem and if there is its the fault of somebody else and not our problem . 
  thats the spirit of the dark force . 
  now pass on what you have learned , luke . 
   what 's the reasoning behind this ? 
  because where to deport them too ? 
   wo n't those people end up as illegal immigrants that do n't receive any benefits and will get exploited on the black market ? 
  if https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/aufenthaltsstatus_ ( deutschland ) #ohne _ aufenthaltstitel _ .28 geduldete .29 does not apply ( illegal but social benefits as described at https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/duldung_ ( aufenthaltsrecht ) #sozialleistungen _ .28 unterhaltsleistungen .29 ) then options here - like black market labor , bagging , crime , support within the growing community of illegals , etc - may still better then somewhere else . 
  probably a decision each individiual has to do for himself . 
  each may have different reasons . 
  many seem to conclude to stay . 
   if enforcement is not possible , what is it people expect from the right-wing parties ? 
  stop the uncontrolled migration maybe ? 
  who comes in , stays in . 
  logical result is to close merkels open doors and not let anybody in who reaches `` borders '' through a corridor she just opened . 
  same like we still do at airports for example . 
  same we did past decades . 
  same all countries do . 
  the thing that used to work for decades here too till merkel went on a world-wide pr-stunt . 
  for many it seems to be rather visible that control was lost and many seem not willing to keep a state going that has zero control of what happens . 
  our chicken government polishs there egos , blames everybody else but themself , loots the people while igores the problems if not even making them more worse with each single step . 
  people look for someone whos able to bring back control and its not the establishment who continues to serious f * ck up . 
  of course do extremists win since they are the only ones who actually admit there is a problem that needs to be solved . 
   according to this quite official looking site , that should n't be the case . 
  thats not what they write . 
  you can easy prevent the later by not having a [ passport ] ( http://www.welt.de/regionales/hamburg/article147659007/jeder-fuenfte-fluechtling-ist-ausreisepflichtig.html ) for example . 
   it 's not implemented/enforced properly ? 
  enforcement is an illusion taking the current numbers . 
  finding enough places to sleep is already a logistical nightmare we fail at right now .
