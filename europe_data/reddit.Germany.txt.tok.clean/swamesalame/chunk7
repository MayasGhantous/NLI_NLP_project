  deportion needs much more then that . 
  its just impossible . 
  the option left is passing on to a neighbour using quotas or another `` european enforcement mechanism '' to deport within europe which not works either . 
  reality is , whos in stays in . 
  thats why germany pushes for outer european camps now to prevent entering . 
  then we can process outside , leave rejected alone , claim fences are not around germany but around europe and human responsibility is with someone else . 
  reestablishing the last decades solution of a fortress europe because open doors not works - doh !, 
  you do not need citizenship to stay and get social benefits . 
  as of now you only need to enter germany , claim asylum . 
  if rejected or accepted does n't matter . 
  in is in . 
  throw your passport away to be extra sure deportion will not happen . 
  in this case ( 4 ) may apply since `` aufenthaltserlaubnis nach \u00a7 20 , \u00a7 38a oder eine blaue karte eu '' is n't a given . 
  the option does exist , its only a matter if/how its used . 
  these  70 % young males going to be very angry and our socity as a whole will suffer . 
  of course its the worst our gov can do . 
  thats why i think it will be done . 
  maximizing the damage and problems is the goal or did you got another impression ? 
  first close to nobody is send back . 
  second its uncontrolled because there are no checks done , no point-system in place , qualification or background are not taken into account , not even passport control happens . 
  whoever manages to survive and arrive at the border is in . 
  merkel ( suspension of dublin ) and german media ( broadcasting the `` welcome-sommerm\u00e4rchen '' around the world ) did . 
  i bet they will not . 
  2-3 times the current numbers , where the whole mess started only ~ 2 months ago with many more months ahead , cause of family reunion is undoable . 
  things are escalating very fast right now . 
   `` we 'll take the men but the women and children must stay behind . '', 
  sounds like a great idea to maximize the problems with those who end here ( the  70 % young males ) . 
  this is going to end very ugly . 
  that , uncontrolled migration , seems to be the most important aspect and many are willing to ignore there other points , even when on disagreement , to at least get that in . 
  people underestimate how important that single topic is for many . 
  because they are neoconservatives , a kind of german tea-party movement with a highly incompetent set of leaders . 
  most who are going to vote for them will know they will earn a worse-then-fdp . 
  but its the only party not being all open-doors & take what you can carry what compensates other disadvantages so it seems . 
  it used to be , past . 
  this days its used just for about everything . 
  ttip demonstrants , anti-globalization , merkel critics , its all nazis . 
  of course not being a merkel fan can be seen as worst insult that exists in germany ... or the opposite . 
  i am kind of shocked to find so less infos about all that :-( so , ok , giving up on my previous not-link-extremists policy since i not like to contribute to this silent mess . 
  * [ no magida ] ( https://www.facebook.com/block.magida/ ) * [ magdeburg b\u00fcrgerwehr ] ( https://m.facebook.com/hashtag/b\u00fcrgerwehr ) - also linked by no magida btw . 
  mdr again , is there any other media reporting about such stuff left ? 
  i am now actually not sure any longer that the 30 `` hooligans '' are related to them . 
   i do n't know how the mdr article could know for sure that the 30 hooligans do n't have a right wing affiliation . 
  yes , thats also something i did asked myself . 
  also that they ( mdr ) wrote afghans unlike all other sources and unlike a previous victim . 
  or its different groups of 3 but then why did n't they wrote so ? 
  as more i try to dig through such things as more i realize how bad of a job our media does this days . 
  one source in max , everybody copycats from everybody , speculations everywhere , journalists add or remove infos here and there as pleased , self-censoring , terrible : - / ** update ** there are a few such b\u00fcrgerwehrs springing up everywhere . 
  [ schwanewende ] ( http://www.taz.de/!5237412/ ) and [ perleberg ] ( https://dokmz.wordpress.com/2015/07/26/staatsschutz-ermittelt-das-wars-mit-der-burgerwehr-in-perleberg/ ) . 
  a short google search shows that lot of them exist . 
  you germans are fast forward moving into very serious problems and censorship will only accelerate it . 
  thanks . 
  i browsed through there facebook but was n't able to find this particular post . 
  can you maybe link it ? 
  the mdr article also reported that the 30 hooligans not have a right wing / neonazi background . 
  so , maybe not the same group or maybe one of the sources ( mdr or no magida ) added speculations . 
  good possible . 
  unfortunately this days press is complete silent on such cases ( on both sides ) making cross checking incredible difficult . 
  horrible self censorship : - /  neonaziaufmarschs in # halberstadt my google gives me only april 2015 for such a happening . 
  seems they do that every year or so since at least 2006 . 
  that happens if you not have a proper job and no intentions beside being against something and blaming others . 
  they learned well from our politicans , lol . 
  please please sources . 
  i would love to read more about this side of the story . 
  thanks in advance and lot of thanks for speaking up :-), 
  http://stgeorgewest.blogspot.com/2014/05/swedens-totalitarian-feminist.html you even did send triggergirl to the european parlament to share your problems with all of us . 
  nice try but we are still far ahead with our fiscal dynamite duo thedarkmerkel and sch\u00e4ubleboy . 
  only found biased media links . 
  impossible to find other media this days : - / additional sources to balance welcome . 
  quote from the article :  both of them had served on a now-defunct commission that had been set up by pope francis in 2013 as part of his drive to reform the holy see 's finances . 
  thats hard enough . 
  but it gets even harder ...  one must keep in mind that the leaking of confidential information and documents is a crime '' under a law enacted in the first months of francis ' papacy , the vatican statement said within the first month the new pope made wistleblowing such financial crimes a crime too . 
  so , you missed to find additional details then ? 
  ok , no big deal . 
  keep on looking . 
  how is your comment even related ? 
  of course anything written in any article is speculations till police investigations are done and a report published . 
  and if this results in a court-case then we may not know till the court decided and even then ...  anyone else with more sources , details about this case ? 
  that was the key-question . 
  the in the topic linked article is full of speculations too hence i asked for more sources with more speculations to balance the [ spiegel sucks ] ( http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/46/46413/1.html ) effect away . 
  so , looking for more details about that case . 
  what i found so far : the [ original mdr article ] ( http://m.mdr.de/sachsen-anhalt/unbekannte-ueberfallen-asylbewerber-in-magdeburg100_zc-a2551f81_zs-ae30b3e4.html#mobilredirect ) writes : * a 24 years old was arrested short after but cause no evidence left free . 
  hes a known hooligan . 
  * speculation is that the 30 people are hooligans who planed there attack online . 
  * speculation is that these 3 syrians committet at least some of the assaults and rapes . 
  * the region seems to have a big problem with at least 4 known rapes in october alone . 
  according to the mdr source linked above all offenders , not clear if its always these 3 , are believed to be refugees . 
  now i ask myself why this 3 are set free ? 
  unfortunately there are no additional details or i did n't found them . 
  anyone else with more sources , details about this case ? 
  ** update : ** not sure if but i may found the facebook-group named in the article . 
  to low quality and to much hate to link it . 
  but reading fast through it they seem to describe themself als `` b\u00fcrgerwehr '' and there may indeed not a direct connection between the 3 syrians and the other cases ( second mdr link ) . 
  violant people making problems to solve problems cause `` nobody else does '' . 
  gosh , things escalate :-( ** update 2 : ** [ more ] ( http://mobil.mz-web.de/mitteldeutschland/sexuelle-noetigung-in-magdeburg-syrerin-wird-mit-messer-bedroht,23886144,32228900.html ) and [ more ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvdkkzbalpq ) from [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/3r5vhg/19_year_old_girl_in_german_city_becomes_victim_of/ ) reddit threat . 
  for many the option to get caught makes the thing actually even more interesting . 
  if you never get caught then that extra may turn out to be an illusion and vanishs :-( so , getting actually caught can result in more satisfaction next time because you know , you experienced , you really can get caught and its aweful hot to know this can happen anytime . 
  that why outdoor-sex , sex in airplane toilets , sex in public , is such widespread . 
   you could , but why would you want to ? 
  never question your fetish , enjoy it . 
   where they might stay jobless even in germany lesser then 10 % qualify for a job .
