  cheap labor , no language knowledge , no option . 
  * http://www.visegradgroup.eu/refugees-in-poland-the  at least get benefits and a place to stay , even if its just a tent/camp working some days illegal in germany brings you more cash then a whole month social benefits in most eastern europe countries . 
  and come on , you can not leave them in tents or things are going to explode . 
  read up what the housing + homeless + benefit situation for refugees is in eastern europe . 
  there is just no money in eastern europe to handle that . 
  its going to be mass tent camps like in turkey but more cold . 
  you think they would stay there after leaving exact that situation to head to germany while now being only some hours away ? 
  really ? 
   in the poor country they at least get the chance to create a decent/good life they flee from having poor tent-camps without perspective . 
  thats the exact same situation they end in when deported to eastern europe . 
  of course will they move on once more . 
   in the rich country they will be criminals/outlaws taken that 90 % arrived europe without passport thats not new either ... 
  if you can pick between illegal ( not necessarly criminal ) or poor what would you pick ? 
  and come on , they are not alone , outlaws . 
  masses are going to be in the exact same position , forming there own parallel socity . 
  and we can do nothing about that because we can not handle , deport such masses again and again if they just come back because they are just some hours of travel away . 
  the only way this could work is when we apply , hungary-like , laws to imprison illegal migrants or deport them far far away outside europe so coming back is not that easy . 
  but even if , we not have the capacity to even handle a fraction of the current numbers . 
  the whole quota story is a strawman . 
  the only benefit is for germany to have lesser numbers on the official papers , pay lesser social benefits , and ignore the problem by forcing many to stay illegal in germany . 
  and the side-effects , like parallel socities , increased crime ( due to limited perspective ) , social unrest and all the other problems are ignored , for somebody else left to solve . 
  from your own [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/inner_german_border ) quote :  it was made one of the world 's most heavily fortified frontiers so , why do you think that was so ? 
  the answer is in the sentence direct following your quote ...  in the hinterlands behind the border were more than a million north atlantic treaty organisation ( nato ) and warsaw pact troops . 
  and direct the sentence afterwards says ...  the border was a physical manifestation of winston churchill 's metaphorical [ iron curtain ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/iron_curtain ) that separated the soviet and western blocs during the [ cold war ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/cold_war ) . 
  it marked the boundary between two ideological systems got the difference or do i need to go more into historical details ? 
  and that one :  despite this people still illegally crossed the border by that logic we not need prisons because there where prisonbreaks , not need police because there are unsolved crimes , not need hospitals because some people still die in there . 
  come on . 
   the weakest link you probably refer to the `` wasserbetteffekt '' and not realize that the weakest link used to be staying in safe surrounding camps . 
  that was the case past years . 
  the weakest link changed when borders got opened , dublin suspended and everybody invited to join . 
  merkel ... 
  mutter der fl\u00fcchtlinge \u00fcberw\u00e4ltigende willkommenskultur '' what effect do you think a fence has beside being a fence ? 
   once everything is fenced off you need to be able and willing to protect these fences with force . 
  you assume that the target is to keep everybody out using this fences . 
  what if the target is to direct the flow to `` check-points '' ? 
  what if registering and maybe even pre-processing needs to happen there ? 
  what if only these with legal asylum claims can legally enter ? 
  follow the latest discussion about merkel 's transitzones to see that the legal framework is in place already and ever was . 
  remember the gaddafi deal ? 
  i would be very ashamed , but not surprised , if we start to punish poor children for doings of our politicans or use children to put pressure on the wrong people not responsible for the situation . 
  i gave links to article and quoted them . 
  not sure why these articles confuse you ? 
  i suggest to read them again since they write explicit about ** land border ** . 
  where did you got the silly idea from to build fences at sea borders ? 
   why isnt everyone living in a schengen country who cant find a job in his country not already in germany doing that ? 
  because not everybody is willing to abort everything , leave family and friends behind , leave your native country and native culture + language to join another country + culture + language with similar perspectives , no ( legal ) job , like at home . 
  the situation is of course different when you already did that step and moved . 
  then the question is not if to reallocate but where to reallocate to . 
  would you rather stay jobless in a poor or rich country ? 
  would you rather join a country which has already plenty of people from your cultural background in a similar situation , who can help you , or stay alone surrounded by working natives in some small town poor country ? 
  how do you think ghettos happen ? 
   children can not go to school etc. 
  not correct . 
  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/greece-turkey-border-fence_55f9ab73e4b0d6492d63ec12  the decision to build the fence was controversial . 
  the european commission argued in 2011 that it `` would not effectively discourage immigrants  [ ... ]  the effects of the fence were instantly felt , according to the authorities , with migration numbers in the area falling as much as 90 percent immediately after it was erected . 
   [ ... ]  though the flow of migrants and refugees crossing the northern land border reduced , the numbers of those arriving on the eastern aegean islands rose considerably from 2012 to 2013 , and dramatically from 2014 onwards they have fences , it works , but they not have fences everywhere and now the flow goes through where no fences are . 
  you not need forces , you need fences . 
  http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/eu-refuses-to-fund-greek-border-fence-with-turkey.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=13346&amp;newscatid=338  the european commission rejected feb. 7 a request from greece to help pay to build a fence along its porous border with turkey , calling the project `` pointless . ''  [ ... ]  the cost is estimated at 5.5 million euros . 
   [ ... ]  `` fences and walls are short term measures that do not solve migration management issues in a structural way . '' that was over 3 years ago . 
  yeah , we solved it different in a more long-term structural way meanwhile ... greece finances are under control of eu which is under control of germany . 
  realize that the current situation is wanted . 
  it was prepared and worked on since years . 
  thats the news/media only . 
  the sleeping masses think we can not handle it and lost all control . 
  thats a big one because its an opener for extremists who promise to bring back control . 
  there are yet not much forces using this opportunity successfully but we see raising number of forces ( csu , afd ) who try . 
  no doubt are we moving to a situation where a real hardliner can take it all over . 
  i think most not realized that yet and fight there strawmans on relative harmless side shows labeling everything nazis while helping effective to lower the barrier for real extremists . 
  things will shift , no doubt there . 
   are apparently nazis so is anybody who speaks against ttip . 
  its just a common deployed strategy this days and any claim xyz are nazis can not be taken serious . 
  unfortunately there are to much dumb people in germany who believe anything media tells . 
  its a growing problem that the masses are not proper educated and continue to vote for the cdu+spd disaster . 
  spd+cdu has that majority and please not argue that spd will not change its position . 
  they are known as `` umfallerpartei '' ( no bones , no promise that is n't broken ) for reasons . 
  transitzonen , camps outside of europe , are coming . 
  fences , to prevent people leaving this camps and walking straith into europe , are a consequence . 
  of course , due to merkel 's keeping face strategy , this are not traditional fences but `` safety zones '' labeled `` einreisezentren '' or `` weiterreisevorbereitungsgewerkschaftskommunen '' to make it sound all different , human , a rainbow and unicorn solution soooo different from hard , cold and evil fences . 
  our walls will be around them rather then us and be pink !,

   duldung / toleration is an legal status that allows them to stay thats exactly not , see https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/duldung_ ( aufenthaltsrecht ) . 
  toleration is a temporary suspension of deportion and is is an illegal status . 
  short translation : still illegal but due to temporary suspension of the deportion , which can be executed later , the illegal state is n't punished by law , ie no prison . 
  that means duldung comes automatically if you cannit be deported cause , for example , no passport . 
  80 % of the refugees/migrants have no passport . 
  questions ? 
  please give sources for your statements . 
  just a matter of time till ikea offers `` asylbyr\u00e5 '' , a set of products ranging from rage-friendly funiture over bulletproof tents and fire-resistant housing to do-it-yourself fences . 
   these were wrong reports no , these leaving by themself are mostly european migrants . 
  the rate of middle east and africa migrants leaving by themself once rejected is near zero . 
  below 10 % of those who need to be deported are deported . 
  the other 90 % end `` geduldet '' , while should be deported are not deported , and get the whole social benefits package . 
  and do n't believe for a second this is going to change . 
  deportion is difficult , a very long and expensive process . 
  the whole `` german army has two airplanes '' , `` new laws to accelerate '' , blabla is gamesmanship . 
  there is no way we can deport 10000 people a day to keep up . 
  we hardly managed it to deport 10000 people a full year . 
  locals work seldom illegal because it actually sucks since there are not much such jobs , most are physical exhausing with no enforced work protection laws , the money is rather small , often enough you not get payed at all , etc.
