  well , opened the german doors and asked hungary to let them pass . 
  both together is what enabled the corridor and that resulted in an ever since then growing number of people who use that , by her opened , corridor . 
  this was a per-case court-decision and in that case reason was the medical need of the asylum-seeker after losing eye and leg due to bombs . 
  the decision does not apply in general but only in this special case . 
   expect you to know your stuff . 
  they 're not there to hand hold you . 
  sounds like a typical job description . 
  if you have problems with that , and not even like to work on solving these problems , then you may not and never will qualify for the job . 
  and to use the chances provided by our society you need to do something . 
  learn , improve , try . 
  most of these arriving here start from scratch just like first grade school children . 
  things not fall at you for free while sitting at your coutch . 
  you need to grap opportunities and spend serious time , years , to open doors and build up qualification . 
  only once you passed that you can join higher education paths like universities , find tons of good payed job , rule your life . 
  most of refugees not can skip that and walk straith to a university . 
  thats not how things work . 
  they need to build up qualification needed for everyone to attend a university first . 
  this is our education-path and it works like that for everybody . 
  this is only work education and not even higher level education like university . 
  abort because to difficult , to less money , takes to long . 
  suprise , you are not well payed to make use of the opportunities the society offers you . 
  and its like that for most of us . 
  welcome to reality where education , money and living your dream is actual hard and years long work . 
  and you think its a lose for france that g\u00e9rard depardieu left ? 
  think again :-), 
   it is practical to close of short spaces of the border its only south germany , the entry route , that needs to be closed what is a short border . 
  this are 816km in total . 
  the german wall , massive and very effective splitting eastern and western germany over decades , was 1378km long . 
  your opinion does n't hold against cold hard facts like recent history of our very own country . 
  [ factor 3 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ozzae/germany_registers_409000_migrants_in_40_days/cw2d6or ) so we talk about 10 million a year . 
  the common deportation scheme across countries is germany , lol . 
  [ the eu does whatever a eu does ] ( http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1r828rfd2ai ) and ttip . 
   free healthcare i bet this is n't going to stay for much longer . 
  its the opportunity to move forward on privatization of the whole health sector . 
  same with social benefits which will be massive slashed down forcing more people to work cheaper then cheap labor . 
  of course certain taxes will be increased . 
  the [ mehrwertsteuer ] ( http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/71899/umfrage/einnahmen-mehrwertsteuer/ ) for example , which hits the poorest most , while there will be , of course , no [ reichensteuer ] ( http://www.nachdenkseiten.de/?p=27848 ) or any other form of [ lastenausgleich ] ( https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/lastenausgleichsgesetz ) to actually make use of [ germanys wealth ] ( http://www.nachdenkseiten.de/?p=27480 ) . 
  no , its the poor and working population who have to pay all that , by paying more for less , like usual . 
  and its other poor groups - refugees , migrants , nazis , communists , jobless , age-groups like pensioners or the youth , religious groups , killergamers , etc etc - going to be blamed . 
  divide and conquer . 
  well , hungary build the wall to keep refugees out . 
  we build the wall to keep germans in . 
  thats the difference . 
  just jocking maybe :-), 
  its fascinating how a link can trigger all kind of cruel reactions :-) so whats your point in the context of deporting to north africa , lybia , madagascar and similar historic relations ? 
  i am not able to read anything between the lines of rage : - / no need to feel offended when looking at the past , more so if we look at things unrelated to both of us but related to the situation . 
  relax , breath , apply logic and gim me some smooth talking points please . 
   banks obviously want their money banks got there money back and fat profits on top . 
  who do you think the greece bailouts where for ? 
   at the expense of the greek people they suffer most but do n't make the mistake to think you and me will not have to pay for that too . 
  somebody has to pay the huge pre 2010 profits and the post 2010 bailouts . 
  its not going to be those who made the profits and its not going to be the poor greence population alone . 
  cash is not burned it just switches ownership moving from bottom to up . 
  oh boy , what did my little comment result in ? 
  : - / now we are at madagascar ( [ german ] ( https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/madagaskarplan ) / [ english ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/madagascar_plan ) ) again ... 
  one more case on the table is that our pension system is [ collapsing ] ( http://m.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/a-977029.html ) . 
   we will need to either raise the taxes drastically , or cut other spendings both . 
   they do n't do it on purpose as german i not agree : its on purpose . 
  we fiscal waterboarded greece and it was full on purpose with majority of germans , influenced through our media , being disappointed it was n't smashed harder . 
  then it all went full rage against hungary , russia and just anyone who can be blamed shifting the frustration away from merkel . 
   patience , respect , good/thought-out arguments and strong will the way the quota-case was forced through does n't show the mutual respect absolute needed on european level to make this union work . 
  this is caused by undemocratic european structures as much as merkel-germany controlling them . 
  thats not how the thing can or should work . 
  we need a new deal on european level . 
  build fences and control borders works . 
  see hungary . 
  apply that at european level if needed for every country . 
  thats the alternative plan .

   the ones that are aggressive should be deported without a question but the peaceful should stay and since that does not happen things escalade . 
  surprise not . 
  there is no way around drastical slashing social benefits and increasing taxes for the working population . 
  the biggest problems are with the pensions but that horrible part of the story is not visible yet . 
   which will multiply the number of refugess with an estimated factor of four factor of two . 
  only 1/3 bring family member . 
  each of the 1/3 brings in average 6 family members . 
  that equals factor two . 
   it actually does n't border any of the countries at war not yet but we are moving there . 
  build fence around merkel . 
  make a corridor from outer europe into merkel 's fence place . 
  of course you need an id and show it . 
  you not need a visa . 
  good point . 
  if op likes to count only these who register for asylum then he maybe likes to add family-members which enter due to family-reunion laws . 
  according to [ spiegel ] ( http://m.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/a-1056379.html ) around 1/3 do that and each of them brings 4-8 family-members over ( median 6 ) . 
  but we also need to shrink the 3.7 because only asylum-seekers who got asylum can bring there family over . 
  unfortunately it seems to be hard to find proper numbers for that . 
  lets assume 35 % ( cause 20 % are syrians which get 100 % followed by afghans which also get asylum by majority ) . 
  so , your number : 3.7 million + 3.7 * 0.33 * 0.35 * 6 = 6.3 million a year . 
  not 10 million but closer . 
  this are only fully legal and accepted asylum-seekers . 
  and of course we still assume linear , means zero future grow , numbers . 
  ** update : ** seems i missed an important [ change in laws ] ( http://www.fluechtlingsrat-lsa.de/2015/08/erleichterter-familiennachzug-zu-subsidiaer-schutzberechtigten-auch-rueckwirkend-seit-1-8-2015/ ) : since two months even `` geduldete '' asylum seekers ( reject but not deported what equals 90 % of all asylum seekers as of now ) can bring there family members over . 
  that changes a lot since it means our calculation now looks like : 3.7 million + 3.7 * 0.33 * 0.9 * 6 = ** 10.3 million a year . 
  ** there we are at the 10 million a year again ... 
   can be interpreted in different ways , in an interview with a swedish guy so the official statement from the police , that only half of these who enter do register while the other half vanishs , can be interpretee in different ways . 
  enlight us how you interpret it please . 
   as we 're told we are told the numbers that register since this are the only numbers counted . 
  ] ( https://www.tz.de/bayern/hat-bundespolizei-zahlen-von-fleuchtlingen-in-bayern-geschoent-5558188.html )  a third/half are from balkan and never getting asylum since only 10 % of rejected asylum seekers are deported it makes no difference . 
   frontex only report 710.000 arriving in europe in the first 9 months the thing only started in september and in september alone 300.000 where counted in germany .
