i 'm half turkish and i agree 100 % about not letting erdogan 's turkey in , get him the fuck out we want secularism back !!!, 
  sorry english is n't my first language , sometimes i slip up, 
  damn rip to all the brits who actually enjoyed there freedom of movement, 
  i do n't understand them , if i were fleeing from a war zone i would be so grateful to get asylum in any european country , you do n't get to pick and choose . 
  half turkish cypriot half german and i can say we are very secular and every europeanized , i always feel so bad for turkey because of the way it 's becoming :(, 
  do n't think this is 70 % american, 
  turkey has been wanting to settle this issue for a while now ? 
  and so do the northern cypriots , i 'm pretty sure it was the greeks cypriots that just recently halted the talks, 
  let 's hope they reach an agreement, 
  rip france, 
  agreed i definitely think they should be able to join, 
  do you consider yourself european ? 
  good for romania !, 
  poor thing , could n't imagine finally getting to the final and then this happen, 
  i do n't mind the hijab , but burkas are just way too much , imo, 
  yay !, 
  the reason why they should n't be dropped is because turkey wo n't be like this forever , in time things will change and turkey will have a new government that will be eager to work with the eu after what 's happened with erdogan , even with not having turkey join , the eu chapters would make turkey a better place once they have been implemented . 
  because it 's a part of greece malta is its own country so it gets a dot , your dot is on main land greece, 
  yep, 
  try r/askeurope, 
  yes slowly we will build our way up to taking over all of europe muwahahaha, 
  it 's called freedom of movement mate , just pop over and let them know you 're there to stay, 
  my beautiful m\u00fcnchen :(, 
  i 'm a turk and i 'd rather you guys take it rn , you 'd do much better with it considering where this is going, 
  if they are nice and do n't cause any problems for bosnian 's future eu integration and bid and recognize kosovo then yes they should be a member state at the time of meeting all the requirements, 
  i know i 'm not the only turk who wish the took the bloody shot and rid the world of that bastard , maybe just maybe we could have had our secular turkey back , anything would be better than what 's to come, 
  america , uk , australia and new zealand should have freedom of movement and tariff free trade, 
  then push the turkish gov to stop sliding on democracy, 
  poor turkey , rip secularism , i feel so bad for the westernized turks, 
  i 'm sorry but does n't everyone want him out anyways ? 
  call your internet provider and tell them to suck your kura\u0107 for having speeds that low, 
  apparently we are n't european enough for him , everyone hates us, 
  yeah i can agree they should integrate more , i have but then again i really am german , but at the same time i 'm also turkish cause i 'm literally half and half , but it could be cause my family is from izmir so they were always very western and europeanized , i love deutschland with everything in my heart, 
  i 'm actually half german half turkish , no reason to be hateful not all turks are islamist, 
  yeah i 'm confused cause i 'm half turkish and every time i meet a greek or been to greece it 's been nothing but love, 
  nah pretty sure it was sarkozy that really made us mad , he was just plane rude and racist, 
  the turkish people will not be happy about this, 
  what a time to be alive, 
  thank you portugal dir avenging us, 
  yeah dads is a turk from \u00c7e\u015fme ( near greece ) mom is swiss german live in germany through swiss passport also have an american passport it 's complicated, 
  well if the british passport you have is from the uk and not an overseas territory , then it does n't matter how long you are there because you still have freedom of movement at this time ( the uk has n't left the eu yet ) so it would n't matter how long you are in the schengen area ? 
  it 's one of your rights as an eu citizen, 
  half turk and i love iove love loveeeeee greece, 
  hate my life, 
  please, 
  little late now wales, 
  really good looking, 
  good at least they have some since, 
  fucking bullshit article, 
  can we please remove him and get secular westernize turkish gov back, 
  honestly if cyprus is europe why not just cut the half of turkey that 's in the med and include it ? 
  i 'm all for you guys !, 
  hope we play each other in the finals !, 
  i was on edge during the pens literally could n't take my eyes off the screen, 
  honestly i would be happy with efta and eea like norway has , they do n't want us to make decisions then that 's fine with me, 
  i also never thought the uk would leave the eu but honestly i think the main thing holding back turkey is erdogan and honestly if he was out of the picture anything could happen, 
  seriously now is the perfect time to give in and reform the country , we could actually have a chance at eu if they would stop being so stupid, 
  what a guy , really like him, 
  pls no, 
  i do n't understand why europe ends at the bosporus ? 
  the half of turkey is in the mediterranean surrounded by europe , if kazakhstan has land in europe and has a land border should n't more than half of turkey be considered europe , or maybe i 'm just autistic, 
  love how they say we need to fix the cyprus issue but the greek cypriot government was the one who suspended talks on reunification recently while turkey and the turkish side are pushing for them to continue . 
  mhm, 
  stop , we wo n't done have to give up of erdogan , thing change all the time . 
  it would be good for us to be a part of a united europe when we meet the requirements, 
  please , turkey has a lot of potential, 
  keep dreaming mate, 
  i honestly would n't mind , but i think we should have all the current candidates join and funky adopt the copenhagen criteria . 
  then start on russia , and slightly worried cause russia 's land mass is so big, 
  3 hours holy shit, 
  how about we fix ties with europe too while we 're at is pls, 
  bosna, 
  it was so beautiful, 
  and people say turks are bad, 
  wish he can fold and fucking let these eu reforms happen, 
  agreed we should, 
  nice flag designs, 
  sorry i do n't think 1.9 % difference should be accepted when you have people saying `` i did n't think my vote would count '' `` i voted for a laugh '' and when people google `` what is the eu '' after they voted . 
  rip, 
  and i 'm sure you can i learned german in a year and now i 'm fluent, 
  bloody shame the same kind of people who do n't even know what the eu is robbed people like you who need and deserved those rights from you . 
  :( hope there is another referendum, 
  you could move to another european country , you have at least two years till you 're out of the eu , and if you 've been in the new country for two years i 'm sure at the time of britain 's actual exit you would be given a permanent resident visa and wait another 2-7 years depending on the country and apply for citizenship there and boom you 're back into the eu, 
  i feel your pain , i was kinda in the same boat but then i got my swiss citizenship , hopefully if there 's a scottish referendum and maybe you could move up before the vote and then get citizenship there since you would be living there at the time of separation ? 
  any way there would be a referendum to join the republic of ireland ? 
  or is religion still a big push to be separated, 
  i agree they 're should be another referendum, 
  they 're the lucky ones , at least they 're eligible to get and eu passport, 
  do n't people in northern ireland have republic of ireland citizenship alongside british ? 
  so atleast they still have eu rights, 
  i would rather turkey be an efta state , like norway etc, 
  good the scottish people should get there independence and join the eu, 
  honestly turkey is the issue with there eu bid , the turkish gov is n't implementing the chapters . 
  if they did all the reforms they could have visa free and eventual membership . 
  my family is in izmir :(, 
  amen, 
  fuck this is going too far , this asshole is going to put turkey back into the storm ages, 
  this does n't represent all turks just erodgan 's puppets, 
  let 's hope she can make a well needed change !, 
  turkey has existed long before him and will exist after him , i just hope he does n't damage things beyond repair,
