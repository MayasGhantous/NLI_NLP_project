why would you wear a white shawl * and * a cravatte at the same time ? 
   you can easily replace 1930s with 1960s - nothing would change . 
  dude , you should really read up about the history of life in the su . 
  there 's no point arguing with you otherwise . 
  wtf , take a breather . 
  this is n't personal , the su fell more than a generation ago . 
  btw , we are n't discussing the 30s , you are commenting in a thread about discrimination in the post-stalin su . 
  also , applause !, 
  you just managed to cram both godwin * and * [ ` lynched negroes ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/and_you_are_lynching_negroes ) into one post . 
   no `` preferred ethnicity '' in ussr https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russification it 's like with women 's rights . 
  officially the su embraced the equality of sexes , but in reality women had to contend with a glass ceiling limiting them to non-important and token status . 
  except jews were a minority and were disadvantaged in favor of the majority russians , who certainly needed no uplifting in a system which considered them the preferred ethnicity . 
  and do you really consider having a certain ethnicity to be a legitimate security risk ? 
  the overrepresentation of jews in the intelligencia was one of the reasons for limiting jewish access to higher education . 
  the quotas were based on population numbers , so they strongly impacted jews , which culture put a premium on education . 
  discrimination of jews was [ never an ` open ' policy ] ( https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0015_0_14969.html ) , since it ran contrary to soviet ideology . 
  from first hand accounts i know that people were often unexpectedly impacted by this discrimination . 
  for example job offers could suddenly be rescinded without an official explanation or , as happened in one memorable case , * all * fresh graduates of a nuclear physics department would be sent to work in a closed city ( very prestigious ) , except the single jew , who was forced to switch to a completely different type of physics . 
  actually , there was at least one holdover from stalinism till the dissolution of the su : official discrimination of jews . 
  if your registered ethnicity was jewish , you could be denied admission to schools , universities and places of employment based on a quota system , which put a hard limit on the amount of jews allowed . 
  it did n't matter how good you were or whether there were positions open , if the quota was full , they had to deny you . 
  jews were also considered an ` unreliable ethnicity ' and were excluded from sensitive positions and could not work in some industries , most notably anything involving nuclear . 
  this was one of the reasons a lot of jews emigrated when given the chance . 
  for them , stalin 's discriminatory policies never ended . 
  actually , staging a coup during the leader 's absence is probably a good and [ familiar strategy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_soviet_coup_d%27%c3%a9tat_attempt ) , since away from their center of power they have less chance to resist and are more vulnerable to being isolated . 
  of course it all goes down the drain if you somehow fail to actually arrest the leader . 
   we would have to violate libyan waters . 
  it 's not like libya can do anything about it . 
  and if they do n't agree we could remind them how much aid money they receive and ask them if they remember what happened to gaddafi after he pissed us off . 
  merkel publicly declared that she does n't feel herself bound by the resolution and declined to personally support it . 
  the opposition [ called merkel 's move ] ( http://www.mdr.de/nachrichten/politik/ausland/bundesregierung-distanz-armenienresolution-tuerkei-100.html ) a de facto distancing from the armenia resolution and an affront to the parliament . 
  [ official statement of the government  ( http://www.bundesregierung.de/content/de/artikel/2016/09/2016-09-02-seibert-armenien.html ) no disavowing of the armenia resolution . 
  the federal government protects the sovereign rights of the bundestag . 
  the agreement between turkey and germany was only signed in ' 61 . 
  turkish guest workers were invited to work in the booming economy of the wirtschaftswunder . 
  if you want to talk about rebuilding germany you should look to the italians who came as gastarbeiter in the 50s . 
  private businesses are usually more efficient than government run ones . 
  hypothetically this could mean a win-win for both sides of the deal . 
  the government stops losing money on the yearly subsidy while the buyer turns a bureaucratic loss-leader into a well-run cash cow . 
  railroads operate on the transport market and compete against a lot of substitute products : goods can be transported by truck , ship or airplane ; passengers by car , bus or airplane . 
  railroads do not have a monopoly on transport , they are constrained in their price setting by the same market forces as every other business . 
  railroads are insanely expensive to run and mainly survive through direct or indirect subsidies . 
  nobody in his right mind would pay more than peanuts to acquire one . 
  why do you think so many slavs have blonde hair ? 
  parts of eastern europe were settled by vikings who travelled through there extensively on trade routes to the byzantinum . 
  no , if a law forces the publisher to change a game or be penalized by having its sales restricted , that is the very definition of censorship . 
  also do n't forget that in germany games can be almost or completely banned as well ( indizierung and beschlagnahmung ) , solely based on their content . 
  in the us there is no law forcing publishers to change anything . 
  [ english version  ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_waffg/englisch_waffg.html#p0163 )  ( 1 ) by way of derogation from section 4 ( 1 ) no . 
  1 , a licence to acquire and own guns and ammunition for the purpose of shooting as a sport shall be issued only if the applicant is at least 21 years of age . 
  small calibre weapons are excempt from that requirement , as well as owners of hunting licenses . 
  all applicants < 25 years of age ( including hunters ) have to undergo a psychological evaluation for a non-small calibre wbk . 
  yep , current german law already prohibits < 21 year olds from owning the kind of weapon he used . 
  it 's a measure that was designed to stop school shootings . 
  dude , you should read up on your history a bit . 
  russia ( the su ) was hitler 's ally for the first three years of wwii , right till hitler betrayed them in 1941 . 
  in fact wwii was started by germany and the su invading poland * together . 
  * and if you think that 's ancient history , you should read some of the propaganda produced by russia for internal consumption today , instead of what they put out in english for foreigners . 
  russia is still playing the great game , for them every nearby country not under their thumb is a potential danger . 
  right now russia is limited by american hegemony to destabilizing ukraine and georgia . 
  but should that protection ever disappear , the baltics would be the first target of an unchained russia . 
   eu ( a bureaucracy ) the eu is not a bureaucracy , it 's a supranational union of states which guarantees its citizens four freedoms ( free movement of goods , capital , services and people ) . 
  when the company 's founder speaks about eu staff he is talking about eu citizens who enjoy the right to live and work in the uk due to this citizenship . 
  when the uk voted to leave the union , they voted for rescinding that right for every foreign union citizen living in their country . 
  maybe they 'll eventually install a visa scheme or bilateral treaties , replacing this right with an uncertain privilege , but for at least the next two years the uk voters fucked over * a lot * of their fellow countrymen . 
  angela has [ learned from the best . 
  voting on legislation is the very last step of the legislative process , * after * a consensus in the council has been reached . 
  beforehand you have months of backroom negotiations . 
  so if uk 's consent is required for a law / treaty change , and its government opposes it , they either change the legislation to suit the uk or it just never reaches the voting phase . 
  so you can have major frustration building up in other countries ' governments about the uk blocking changes , without it ever being openly visible in the voting record . 
  an additional factor is the psychological pressure to not vote against majority supported legislation , which is why countries often register their opposition through informal notices , rather than nay votes . 
  there 's a very interesting [ paper on that topic ] ( http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/sn06646.pdf ) by the uk parliament . 
  nope , it 's [ a socialist thing . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialist_fraternal_kiss ), 
   it 's a moot point now since the eu 's lawyers have agreed that the article needs to be formally and deliberately triggered and can not be inferred indirectly . 
  is there an actual official statement about this ? 
  because the only thing i 've seen linked is a newspaper article citing anonymous sources talking about unspecified lawyers . 
  it 's a legal principle that if a statement by someone contradicts their actions , the statement can be disregarded . 
  if someone steps onto a subway train and loudly exclaims ' i do not intend to contract with the london subway authority ' , a court may disregard that statement because the action of stepping onto the train contradicted it . 
  one could argue that first calling the referendum and then accepting its result contradicts the pm 's statement that he is not invoking article 50 . 
  yes , by voting for your government ( which has a seat in the ec ) and by directly electing your meps . 
  the story and ending as a whole are pretty clich\u00e9 , but damn if it is n't one of the most memorable things i have ever watched . 
  tilda swinton [ killed it ] ( https://youtu.be/_47ph6evqpu ) in every scene she was in and there were just so many awesome or plain comical details that it 's a movie i just ca n't get tired of rewatching .

  [ ] ( / scootacheer ) so who 's your waifu ? 
  so you ca n't even defend your own statements against the simplest of logical challenges ? 
  and then you recommend yt videos ?!, 
  i think we are truly in the / r/im14andthisisdeep territory . 
  that 's sad , i hoped you had some ideas of your own and were n't just parotting half-remembered anarchist slogans . 
  if you do n't want to consume , then who exactly forces you into a rat race ? 
  if you think consumption 's bad then why not just work some part-time job and otherwise ignore professional life ? 
  and if consumption is bad , then an income above the poverty level is useless anyway . 
  so why should anyone care that the rich get richer ? 
  it 's after all them who are trapped in the world of consumption . 
  that sounds more like a terrorist organization . 
  needs more [ random capitalization .
