  do n't you have your government representing you on the eu level ? 
  it eliminates the pull factor . 
  once merkel is gone and the borders are sealed , people will realize there is no bright future for them in europe and wo n't try to cross the mediterranean in rubber boats . 
  there were a million balkan refugees in germany during the 90s , there were asylum homes burning and it was the time the nsu got radicalized . 
  it was far from a peaceful time . 
  but that 's a coucil of europe organization ( * not * the eu ) , their most fearsome weapon is an angry letter telling the addressee how angry they are . 
  the fact that it 's a meme does n't mean it 's not stupid and should n't be banned . 
  the unconnectedness is the meme . 
  the statement about obama made no sense in the original context either . 
  it 's a meme , based [ on this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coos-ft7s2c ) . 
   in my opinion they should n't make it legal per se why not ? 
  it 's legal in germany and aside from some school pranks there have n't been any problems with it . 
  the sad [ tale of kukly ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9a%d1%83%d0%ba%d0%bb%d1%8b_%28%d0%bf%d1%80%d0%be%d0%b3%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%bc%d0%bc%d0%b0%29 ) shows the fate of satire in modern russia . 
  it was once one of the most popular shows on television , [ making fun of everyone ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezjx9bgwdv0 ) and everything . 
  in 2000 the [ nyt reported on kukly ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/18/world/tv-s-impious-puppets-on-kremlin-s-hit-list.html?pagewanted=all ) as the litmus test for the state of press freedom in the country :  the very fact that '' kukly '' can broadcast such heresy on national television , of course , is evidence that freedom of speech lives here , something mr. lyubomirov freely allows . 
   the question , he says , is not whether , but for how long . 
  a year later the governent seized kukly 's host station and shut the show down . 
  and we 'd be much better off without them . 
  i do prefer being able to breathe to carrying around a symbolic phallus on my chest . 
  shhhhh , do n't let the frenchies hear you say that !, 
  the only ones who cling to the [ oktoberfest myth ] ( http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/die-uebergriffe-in-koeln-und-falsche-zahlen-von-der-wiesn-14004617.html ) are the greens , purely out of ideology . 
  the oktoberfest is a party attended by millions of men and women yearly with a miniscule number of sexual assaults and certainly without mobs of men roaming about , making women fear for their lives . 
  you know , until this week i dismissed the small-town rumours floating around about supressed reports of sexual assaults on women near refugee centers , but the behaviour of the government and the media have made me doubt my earlier assessment . 
  google news also has nothing , so maybe you misheard it ? 
  huh , do you have a link ? 
  sadly , police reports concerning refugees have been classified as secret with police [ asking media to not report on them ] ( http://meedia.de/2015/10/23/wie-die-kieler-polizei-versuchte-die-berichterstattung-im-fluechtlingsumfeld-zu-beeinflussen/ ) for fear of backlash . 
  in this light i would n't trust published figures . 
  ok , you are now the mayor of cologne . 
  a group of international journalists is sitting in front of you . 
  one of them asks you : `` ms mayor , how can women keep themselves safe during public celebrations ? '', 
  please formulate a reply in under ten seconds that will not offend anyone . 
   asscher claimed that it gave the impression that women could 've ` helped themselves ' that 's on the media then , not the town mayor . 
  during a press conference she gave a response to a very specific question , which was then taken wildly out of context . 
  maybe a more media-savy politician would have navigated that pitfall better , knowing the spin such words can generate , but it 's pretty unfair for a foreign country leader to demonize a freshly-elected * town mayor * for not handling international media like a pro . 
  maybe this is the very reason that foreign polticians should n't comment on internal matters , since they rarely have a complete picture . 
  to be fair , the mayor did n't claim the advice would have kept the women safe during the attacks . 
  she was [ responding to a journalist 's question ] ( http://www.sueddeutsche.de/panorama/koeln-eine-armlaenge-empoerung-1.2806458 ) regarding general safety advice in the context of an informational brochure published by the town . 
  the article says all prison transports were full . 
  that 's what they want you to think !, 
   why do borders exist if they are evil ? 
  i think that 's a question for your priest . 
  every religion has [ its own answer on that . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/problem_of_evil ), 
  is that somehow bad ? 
  is n't that the whole idea of the eu with the four freedoms and schengen ? 
  what do you mean by that ? 
  \\  agitating against a jewish businessman while calling undesirables `` rootless barbarians '' now where have i [ heard that before ? 
  when you sponsor someone you link your brand to their image . 
  usually the brand reputation profits from it , but if your sponsee starts spouting sexist statements your brand suffers from it as well . 
  even if you ignore ethics , in pure business terms it makes no sense to keep sponsoring someone who hurts you . 
  well , corporation tax rates are the perfect example for why we need the eu . 
  right now , every country does what it wants , so we have a race to the bottom and corporations that pay basically no tax . 
  only the eu could force member states to close tax havens and improve the situation for everyone . 
  one of the basic [ principles of the eu is subsidiarity  ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=uriserv%3aai0017 ) it can only enact laws if the issue can not better be handled on the national or local level . 
   i somewhat trust in national representation to care for national interests however i do not trust nor expect victor orban to care or look after the uk . 
  so do you trust the lower house mp for london to care about scottish interest ? 
  or do you rely for that on the scottish representatives ? 
  because that 's exactly how the eu works , too . 
  the eu is built in a way so that every country is represented on every level . 
  every country has its ep representatives , its commissioner and its seat on the council . 
  well , you 'd need quite a few of these dictatorships to influence the eu , there 's also the eu parliament and the commission that are their own beasts . 
  all in all , it 's much easier for a dictator to wrest control over a single country than for even a couple working together to move the eu . 
  concerning the referendum , it seems the uk will have one too , which is what we are discussing in this thread after all . 
  but even without a referendum , we are living in representative democracies and it 's our democratically elected representatives who built the eu over half a century . 
  so you are opposed to a system that does n't exist ? 
  you ca n't exactly ` come into power ' in the eu , it 's specifically set up in a way to diffuse power as much as possible . 
  btw , do you have any particular reason to prefer national rules over local or supranational ones ? 
  because i could ask the very same question as to why for example scotland allows non-scots in an english building to create laws they and their kids have to live by . 
  looking at his face , the first thing that came to mind [ was a different kind of plot . 
  ] ( / r/watchitfortheplot ), 
   the troops were on base and did not leave . 
  [ who occupied ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj-gfshjk7u ) the crimean parliament ? 
  who [ besieged the ukrainian bases ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsunxb6izdy ) how can you deny that which even [ putin himself admitted ? 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31796226 )  contrary to western propaganda , there were in fact no scenes of special forces rounding people up in trucks to go to vote or go to gulag . 
  ah , so [ tv stations getting their power cut and editorial offices raided ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/sb10001424052702303824204579421314047183636 ) is now no sign of a putsh ? 
  even the [ osce condemed the crackdown . 
  ] ( http://www.osce.org/fom/143861 ) and of course , dissidents [ are n't being disappeared ] ( https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/10/07/crimea-enforced-disappearances ) , they are just taking a vacation in siberia . 
  and [ torture is not used ] ( https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/03/25/ukraine-activists-detained-and-beaten-one-tortured ) , russians are just training their thai massage skills . 
   they are almost universally delighted yeah , very delighted . 
  no power , no tourists , no traffic . 
  but as long as they have putin-tv trucks , everything is well i suppose . 
   the autonomous crimean legislation organised a referendum , as democracies seem to like to happen . 
  you mean the legislature that was at the time occupied by a foreign army , which prevented any not moscow-friendly legislator from entering ? 
   the local inhabitants overwhelmingly voiced support to rejoin russia as a member state of their federation . 
  you mean the * remaining * local inhabitants , after a massive propaganda campaign , censorship of the local media and amidst a crackdown on dissenters `` voiced their support '' in an unmonitored referendum , that was being counted by * totally * independent authorities ? 
  if you want to see how a democratic referendum on self-determination looks like , scotland did it best : both sides had equal opportunity to make themselves heard , the people were free to discuss and make their own decision and the refendum itself was organised transparently . 
  the crimean referendum was anybut but democractic , it was a rushed hack-job , orchestrated to legitimize the occupation ex post facto , [ soviet style . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_pact_invasion_of_czechoslovakia#letter_of_invitation ), 
   by banning them you dramatically increase the cost of them on the black market . 
  i do n't know about cost , but what you certainly would accomplish is to dramatically increase demand , which if other prohibitions have taught us anything , will drive up supply . 
   right , license them to hunters only then , with all the exams that entails . 
  that 's already being done . 
   keep them locked up at the ranges . 
  does n't work because there is n't * the * range for a lot of shooters and they often have to take them to competitions . 
  also the police is against storing weapons at ranges because it creates publicly known and unsupervised arm caches in secluded places that can be looted . 
  russia has been [ implicated in manufacturing the scandal that cost saakashvili his office and has been increasingly active in georgian politics ever since .

  by `` criminal oligarch '' , do you mean the former [ president of georgia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikheil_saakashvili ) , who is lauded for drastically increasing economic growth and [ causing the largest reduction of corruption ] ( http://siteresources.worldbank.org/inteca/resources/act3.pdf ) among all transitioning countries during his tenure ?
