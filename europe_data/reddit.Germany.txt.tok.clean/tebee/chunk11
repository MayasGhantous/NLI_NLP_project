  the former president who 's prosecution in absentia has been called political ( [ influenced by russia ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/melikkaylan/2014/05/31/on-the-ground-in-ukraine-how-the-new-president-can-learn-from-georgia/ ) ) by the us and eu ? 
  i know that half the time i use google a warning is displayed that search results have been suppressed for one reason or another . 
  that 's pretty worrying . 
  actually , looking at the us in particular , presidential systems tend to produce really bad gridlocks * by design * . 
  in a parliamentary republic the chancellor enjoys the trust of the parliament ( or the parliament replaces them ) , so laws and nominations pass with little hindrance . 
  the only difficult part is agreeing on a coalition government in cases without a clear majority . 
  presidential systems on the other hand tend to produce an adversarial system between parliament and president , since they compete for influence and are often headed by different parties . 
  this means that every law and nomination turns into a tug-of-war with parliaments stalling and subverting initiatives of the president while he threatens to veto or not implement laws passed in parliament . 
   they may be poor , but they 're rich enough to buy a rope , smart enough to tie a noose , so start stringing people up . 
  do you even realize what you are advocating for ? 
  the last thing the ukraine needs right now is for a robespierre or stalin to come to power . 
   so many people suffer every day , though me paying taxes that disappear in the pockets of ukranian billionairs and thiefs is n't improving a damn thing for anyone of these people . 
  i know most people in central europe only view the eu as a monetary redistribution system nowadays , but for the people on the periphery the old ideals are still alive and worth fighting for . 
  it 's the collective hope of the ukrainian people to one day be part of our area of freedom , prosperity and justice that provides [ the fighters ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/ukraine-chef-reformer-raschkowan-im-interview-a-1038407.html ) [ against corruption ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/ukraine-georgische-ex-politiker-setzen-reformen-durch-a-1047287.html ) the political power to oppose the entrenched system . 
  should the netherlands really vote against the preparatory treaty with the ukraine , it would be a highly symbolic blow to their efforts . 
  after such a rejection , i would n't even be suprised if a lot of ukrainians turned back to russia in disappointment , since europe would not seem to want them . 
  for the people of the netherlands , the outcome of the vote wo n't matter after a few days of newspaper headlines , but for the ukraine it might decide the fate the nation . 
  so i would really urge you to think hard about what you are really voting about . 
  it 's a modified copypasta of [ remove kebap . 
  that sounds so backwards . 
  the people of ukraine suffered through two revolutions , a civil war and an economic crisis to fight the corrupt system and reorient themselves westward , all in the hope of a better future in a united europe . 
  how would you feel if after all that has happened and all the lives that were lost your efforts would be negated by a simple referendum in which the citizens of one of the most prosperous countries on earth decided to reject you for not meeting their lofty standards ? 
  is n't that a greek flag in your flair ? 
   not with my money . 
  that 's what a lot of germans said about greece , for the very same reasons ... 
  they are also one of the few countries that actively tries to reform itself . 
  reformist forces in the ukraine need to be supported , demonizing the country only strengthens the corrupt elite . 
  because you ca n't publish what does n't exist yet ? 
  hah , that would be pretty hard to keep up here in germany , too many people say nasty things about firearms . 
  i can tell you however that this proposal has the community in uproar . 
  it 's the hot-button issue during competitions , forums and newsletters . 
  there 's even [ an online petition . 
  ] ( https://www.change.org/p/council-of-the-european-union-eu-you-cannot-stop-terrorism-by-restricting-legal-gun-ownership ) as you can imagine , people are n't happy that the eu wants to take away their property and force them to undergo regular medical examinations . 
  heck , i was looking forward to buying a semi-automatic rifle of the type they want to ban once i got a flat big enough for the necessary safe . 
  you can imagine how i feel now , i even already took the test for ipsc rifle just to see how it would feel like . 
  now i may never get to experience it :( also do n't forget small businesses . 
  it 's pretty shitty to just outlaw your business because you chose to follow the trend and sell over the internet and not through a storefront . 
  and how many shops will have to close because they relied on a media-mix to keep afloat ? 
  gun stores are usually not that profitable so they ca n't afford a mainstreet location . 
   but other parts are quite reasonable , like improved tracking of firearms and some better controll of deactivation . 
  those are n't the parts i 'm worried about either , besides the possibility of increased costs . 
  it 's the other parts that are the problem . 
   i googled the critique you linked and the author is part of the german rifle asscocation and of course they will be against tightening up the controll on firearms . 
  well , duh , does n't make her critique less true . 
  also , i 'm a member of several firearms organisations , too . 
  when you are part of a group that is threatened from outside , you tend to band together . 
  the proposed directive and accompanying documents are linked at the bottom of the [ commission press release . 
  ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-15-6110_en.htm ) i have to warn you though , it 's pretty unreadable , since it 's only a diff to the current version . 
  we live in the 21st century , wtf do n't they use wikis for such things ? 
  i also already linked to the [ best critique i have found . 
  ] ( http://www.firearms-united.com/images/download/marini.pdf ), 
  of course it 's only a proposal , but if we wait till it has passed both the parliament and the council it 'll be too late to do anything about it , which is why we have to petition our representatives right now to prevent or at least change it . 
   the law would be pointless the law is already pointless , since they only target legal owners of weapons that are almost completely absent from crime stats . 
  black market sellers of balkan weapons are of course not affected . 
  also there is a precedent for grandfathering : when the modern gun law was introduced in 1970s and again after reunification in 1990 a general amnesty was declared in germany on all existing weapons and they were `` legalized '' , i.e. 
  you could register and keep them . 
  thank you for your reply . 
  i appreciate your intent to focus on the illegal arms trade , but sadly the commission proposal does threaten both legal gun owners and small businesses . 
  the proposal seeks to bureaucractically encumber licensees with regular renewals and makes them dependant on unspecified and likely privacy-invasive medical tests . 
   certain semi-automatic weapons the semi-automatic rifles the commission is targeting are popular hunting and sporting rifles . 
  the commission does n't just want to outlaw them , they also want the states to confiscate them from existing owners without grandfathering . 
  small business are also targeted because the commission wants to require licensing for alarm pistols . 
  these are popular as self-defense weapons and are the backbone of many a local gunsmith 's . 
  in addition , prohibiting online sales will mean the end of non-stationary businesses . 
  the increased tracking requirements are also problematic . 
  in the consultation process the national governments expressed their satisfaction with the existing scheme . 
  increasing requirements and even tracking individual ammunition lots will only increase bureaucracy and costs . 
  legal gun owners are some of the most heavily policed and audited members of society . 
  increasing bureaucracy , expropriating law-abiding citizen , reducing privacy and increasing cost , and all that under the guise of combating terrorism , that 's something that i hope the liberals wo n't stand for . 
  hi catherine , how do you and alde view the [ commission 's proposal to radically restrict private gun ownership ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-15-6110_en.htm ) ? 
  with this proposal the commission is trying to take advantage of the paris attacks to push through a completely unrelated agenda by going after legal gun owners , despite the terrorists having used illegally obtained weapons . 
  the [ history of the proposal ] ( http://www.firearms-united.com/images/download/marini.pdf ) is particularly interesting . 
   in fact , if you find older economics books from around the sixties the possibility that the ussr will be the biggest economy is widely seen as plausible the very same predictions about the su were made in the 30s . 
  they were bullshit based on forged statistics then and they were bullshit in the 60s . 
  if you want to read how the soviet system really worked , there 's a brilliantly written autobiography aptly titled `` an american engineer in stalin 's russia '' ( [ free online ] ( http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docid=ft18700465&amp;brand=ucpress ) ) that shows how it looked from the inside . 
  it 's actually the other way around , the parliament is [ overwhelmingly in favor of staying exclusively in brussels . 
  ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/ficheprocedure.do?lang=en&amp;reference=2012/2308 ( ini \\ ) ) that 's where the de facto main seat is , where the parliamentarians live , where their staff works and where the commission resides . 
  in fact , france had [ to sue the parliament ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/meps-want-to-end-monthly-commute-between-brussels-and-strasbourg-a-934400.html ) because the meps tried to shorten the strasbourg sessions . 
  for the whole series of russian wwi anti-turkish propaganda ( including scenes of mass slaughter and rape ) : https://www.reddit.com/r/propagandaposters/comments/3uadr3/russian_ww1_posters_about_turkey/, 
  to be fair , france had not one , but two coups ( one [ successful ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/may_1958_crisis ) , one [ unsuccessful ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/algiers_putsch_of_1961 ) ) in the same time-frame . 
  singapore was originally a british colony ( like hk ) and of course both japan and korea were rebuilt based on american ideas , so their success can be seen as prime examples of the value of western civilization . 
  you know , when you have seen the same arguments , twisting of truth and lies repeated for months ad nauseum , there comes a time when you can just say : i know it when i see it . 
  of course , maybe i 'm being unfair and attributing to malice what can sufficiently be explained by an overdose of rt , but frankly i have better things to do than argue with that kind of people on the internet . 
  looks like i caught myself my first putinbot . 
  it even helpfully highlights the trigger words its script uses !, 
  seems like the old rule about female usernames on the internet also applies to ukrainian flags on / r/europe . 
  yeah , better be a poor , autocratic client state on the fsb 's leash then a prosperous western country with civil rights and government accountability . 
  meh , the parliament found that yanukowitsh had resigned when he fled the country . 
  it 's all nice and good to endlessly debate legal peculiarities , but when the country is in the throngs of revolution and the leadership has fled to a foreign country , restoring order by appointing a transitional government that has the trust of the people is the first order of business . 
  in the end , whether the retirement of yanukowitsh was legal or not matters little , since the interim government did its job and organized early elections , which in any case led to a government with a democratic mandate . 
  ... unless that bombing cosists of a fully loaded passenger airplane . 
  no , no , anybody but sch\u00e4uble . 
  we breathed a collective sigh of relief when merkel moved him from the ministry of the interior to finance . 
  at least there he can only fuck up greece , not our civil liberties . 
  i do n't want to imagine what he 'd do as chancellor . 
  the difference is : the first one is reporting on one 's own violence ( permissible ) , the second is supposedly inciting other people to violence ( not permissible ) . 
  you ca n't exactly forbid people from reporting on their own actions . 
  though this should still be punishible as membership in a terroristic organisation . 
  no , it 's just the normal appeals process . 
  both the prosecuter and the defendant have a right to appeal .
