  no , that 's [ the finns .

   you guys stop crushing them and your finance minister trying to kick them out of the eurozone that 's an oxymoron . 
  `` crushing '' them ( aka austerity ) was inteded to * keep * greece in the eurozone . 
  a default would most likely have led to a grexit ( from the euro ) . 
  if germany had wanted that , all they had to do was to stop providing loans . 
  critizing a * tasting * competition on reproducability is not what i would call valid criticism . 
  nevertheless , as the wiki article points out , the competition was actually reproduced several times afterwards , displaying generally the same result . 
  they are the only party that opposes merkel 's refugee policy . 
  since refugees are the main topic of this election for a lot of people , the afd has an easy time getting votes , despite being an absolute shit show of a party . 
  that leads to a lot of people supporting the afd who actually disagree with their far-right rhetoric , but simply want to send a message to the established parties . 
  wait , you do realize wwii was started by germany and the soviet union [ attacking poland in concert ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_invasion_of_poland ) , right ?

  do n't let the polish hear that ... 
  numerous factors : * the estimated price was set so low for political reasons . 
  it was known before-hand that it would rise , but kept secret even from the parliament to get approval . 
  * the people the city put in charge of handling the general contractor were way too few and way too incompentent . 
  they let the contractor walk all over them . 
  * the architects and the general contractor hated each others ' guts and refused to work together , making coordination almost impossible . 
  * the city insisted on starting to build before the architects even finished planning , forcing numerous changes to already built parts * the general contractor refused to build according to the architect 's vision , citing safety concerns . 
  that lead to a drawn-out legal war and construction halt . 
  * etc. 
  i do n't know how you even found that site , because it 's hilariously outdated . 
  it 's supposed to summarize parts of the eu constitution , but that treaty was [ rejected in 2005 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_establishing_a_constitution_for_europe ) . 
  the articles it references never went into force . 
  which are entirely useless when the person is already in the country and will probably never be deported because the civil service is completely overwhelmed and he threw away his passport . 
  the right to asylum only covers politically persecuted persons . 
  that does n't apply to ~ 99 % of the people who immigrated over the last years . 
  you forgot the san escobar [ football association . 
  it seems it was four days , but otherwise yeah . 
  i 'm not sure we are disagreeing on anything here .

  dude , there 's an entire [ committee of enquiry ] ( https://www.landtag.nrw.de/portal/www/gb_i/i.1/pua/pua_iv_16._wp/mmd16-10798_einsetzungsantrag.pdf ) looking into the `` coverup '' that happened in k\u00f6ln . 
  uhm , so ? 
  the pope 's joke was inappropriate as hell and pretty worrying in itself , but that does n't matter . 
  the protestors could be quoting ghandi , what matters is the context . 
  and in this context such a quote can only be taken as a threat or at least a justification of the massacre . 
   have you even read the article you linked to ? 
  have you [ looked at the photo ] ( http://imgur.com/a/anief ) at the top of the article ? 
  `` insult my mum and i will punch you ! '', 
  how would you interpret such a sign , a month after fellow moslems massacred the people they are protesting against ? 
   and then two burglars decide to rob the embassy . 
  and are thwarted by the elaborate traps of the diplomat 's son , who got left behind by accident when everyone else was expelled ? 
  this is a german school . 
  the pupils there are supposed to be immersed in the german language and culture . 
  this denial is part of [ an organised propaganda campaign ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/lebenundlernen/schule/empoerung-ueber-weihnachts-verbot-an-auslandsschule-in-istanbul-a-1126432.html ) by the akp , trying to spin the original report as fake news . 
  multiple teachers at the school have confirmed the order to cease christmas activities . 
  it 's a german school for turkish kids , part of a cultural exchange program started during wwi . 
  i think he 's confused about polish death camps . 
  spiegel neither did the caricature themselves nor put it on their cover , unlike wprost . 
  edit : okay , [ better ? 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/markokmezic/status/684350074240036864 ) polish media loves to portray germans as nazis , so they can fuck right off themselves . 
  [ turnabout ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/12/polish-press-nazi-imagery-war-of-words-eu-angela-merkel ) is fair play . 
  ukraine is culturally much closer to western europe than turkey . 
  they are also a people who fought two revolutions over the past decade for a western way of life , both against a corrupt elite and against a regional hegemon . 
  a lot of people rightly feel that ukraine deserves a chance at european integration . 
   they can dispute is as much as they want , the constitution says something else . 
  we are arguing international law here , local spanish law is n't very persuasive in that context . 
   self-determination does not mean you get your own country . 
  yeah , there 's a lot of talk about [ regional autonomy as a compromise ] ( http://www.gcsp.ch/news-knowledge/publications/can-autonomy-fulfil-the-right-to-self-determination ) between self-determination and territorial integrity . 
  it seems this approach [ was tried ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statute_of_autonomy_of_catalonia ) but rejected by the spanish constitutional court , which lead to the current situation . 
  huh , i 'm not aware of a significant opposition to the modern interpretation of the right to self-determination as applying to peoples instead of states . 
  the un , the eu , the us and russia all have in the recent past invoked that right - rightly or wrongly - in cases such as south-sudan , kosovo and crimea . 
  btw , i edited my above post after your reply . 
   what you 're saying is a modern reinterpretation . 
  good thing it 's the * modern * interpration that counts in law , especially in international law which is more customary than anything . 
   national sovereignty which would only apply in this case if you presuppose spain to be a * nation * state , which is exactly what the catalan independence movement disputes . 
   do you know the principles of territorial integrity and national sovereignty ? 
  those are n't absolute but must be balanced by the equal [ right to self-determination of peoples . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-determination ) finding a balance between these opposite ideas is one of the major challenges of international law . 
  and it 's completely legitime to criticize countries which suppress one in favor of the other . 
  also good for a lot of us eu citizens with friends and relatives in ukraine or georgia !, 
  germany recently [ decided to join as well . 
  [ same in germany  ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p0923 )  whosoever publicly defames the president of the federation , in a meeting or through the dissemination of written material shall be liable to imprisonment from three months to five years . 
  this law is rarely enforced because the president has to authorize prosecution and that rarely happens . 
  that looks like a historic inspiration for [ this map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fos3yq8.jpg ) ( [ broken source ] ( https://www.keiththompsonart.com/pages/grandmap.html ) ) .

  so smoking is prohibited on one side , but not the other ? 
  no , visa costs go to governments , not countries . 
  peoples constitute countries , governments only rule them . 
  visa costs are also supposed to be cost-covering , not profit-driven . 
  so the government wo n't lose anything if no visas need to be issued anymore . 
  family members can finally visit each other without lengthy , complicated and costly visa procedures . 
  you need to differentiate between pull - and push-factors when talking about migration . 
  the migration wave we witnessed last year was a combination of both worsening conditions in the near east pushing migrants out and northern europe 's open door policy pulling them in . 
  bad conditions in their native countries push migrants to come to europe . 
  that 's something we can do little about and which the fence does not affect . 
  on the other hand , the high living standard of nothern europe and merkel 's `` invitation '' act as a pull factor , convincing people who would otherwise have stayed to leave their country and incentivizing people already on the move to come here . 
  the fence , significantly inhibiting migration north from greece , mitigates the pull factor of northern europe , meaning more people will either stay in their home countries or move to refugee camps near them . 
  very few migrants see greece as a desirable destination .
