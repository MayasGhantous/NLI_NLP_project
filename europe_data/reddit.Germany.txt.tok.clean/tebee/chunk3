  most refugees do n't brave the dangerous sea route just to get into europe , they specifically want to get to germany or scandinavia . 
  when the balkan states closed the transit routes , the dream of endless welfare and a free house collapsed and the refugee numbers dried up . 
  it 's pretty hypocritical for a european to criticize the outdated us election system , when the eu 's more modern one is arguably worse , giving a maltese voter [ * ten * times the voting power ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_parliament#members ) of a german one . 
  yeah , sch\u00e4uble may not be a charismatic figure and a lot of people still remember the party donation scandal , but imho he would be the only chancellor-candidate capable of wiping out the afd at the polls . 
  well , seeing as it 's also happening in austria , i hope you 're right about that salary . 
  he eliminated the pull factor , leading to the decrease of refugees crossing the mediterranean . 
  that 's exactly what everyone was saying about the us election ... right till the night of the vote . 
  there 's also sch\u00e4uble . 
  to be honest , i 'd really love to see how he would fare as chancellor . 
  he 's a very talented politician , he just has to be kept away from the post of interior minister . 
  the simultaneous translations in the ep are often atrocious , particular if they go through an intermediary first ( e.g. 
  estonian --  english --  german ) . 
  that 's why most ep members stick to english , if they want to be understood . 
  there 's only one commissioner per country ... 
  ... and that 's when half of sweden discovered their new fetish . 
  that was despite communism , not because of it . 
  the intelligencia was always treated as a subversive group by the communists . 
  the labeling could be wrong . 
  it 's tagged as january 01st 1903 after all , so at least the first part appears to be a placeholder . 
  those pictures are n't even from the 20th century . 
  [ this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0btfjug.jpg ) features a poster advertising the opening of a store planned for february 1899 . 
  there 's a bible [ quote for everything  ( https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/luke%2022%3a36 )  then said [ jesus ] unto them , `` but now , he that hath a purse , let him take it and likewise his pack ; and he that hath no sword , let him sell his garment and buy one . 
  ok , so for the pedants : polish death camps in germany . 
  that is correct . 
  only loriot humour is acceptable humour . 
   also , they 'd lost their know-how in this kind of big ship construction , so they did n't want to take too many risks by redesigning from scratch some very complex machineries , like catapults and reactors . 
  and that 's why the us is constantly building so much armament , even if it [ sits in the desert ] ( http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/09/army-to-congress-thanks-but-no-tanks/ ) afterwards . 
  if you stop producing , even for a short while , you immediately start to lose know-how . 
  people switch jobs , retire or just forget . 
  this `` brain drain '' does n't just affect the engineering disciplines , but even more so the skilled labor actually building the armament . 
  no matter how much lean manufactoring tries to change it , much of the knowledge required to run a production process is undocumented or implicit . 
  a lot also comes down to workplace culture , which can [ make or break a factory . 
  ] ( http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-change-a-culture-lessons-from-nummi/ ) you shut down a factory for a few months and it may take several years to get it up to speed again . 
  it 's the cooling tower , so relatively unimportant and permanently moist ... 
  well , it 's not an entirely new phenomenon . 
  the franco-prussian war was essentially started by bismarck [ shitposting about the french ambassador . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ems_dispatch ), 
   people voted against yeah , ~ 20 % of the voting population voted against it . 
  that 's really significant !, 
  heresy !, 
  do you work in that field ? 
  because the german wikipedia [ claims ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/physikalische_chemie ) that physical chemistry and chemical physics are interchangeable names for the same field , the application of the principles of physics on chemical processes . 
  as / u/countvontroll pointed out , merkel does n't have a bachelor 's degree ( those did n't exist in germany at that time ) . 
  she has a graduate level degree ( diplom ) and a phd . 
  the diplom was technically in physics , but her thesis was on the topic of chemical physics , just as her later dissertation . 
  she 'd make a great teacher !, 
  account made in 2014 , posting russian propaganda with eu flag ... dare i say it ? 
  enough lebensraum for everyone ? 
  i ca n't be the only one who [ thought that ?!, 
   legislative branch : strasbourg you 'd first have to reorganize the entire way the eu functions . 
  because if you 'd move the legislature to strasbourg , nothing would remain in brussels . 
  the commission , the council and the parliament together [ form the legislature ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_legislative_procedure ) . 
  and most controversial laws are decided by the [ trilogue ] ( https://euobserver.com/investigations/123555 ) of those three institutions . 
   the main problem with the ivth republic was that it was too easy for parliament to topple the government . 
  germany seems to have fixed that problem by requiring a [ * constructive * vote of no confidence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constructive_vote_of_no_confidence ) . 
  basically , parliament ca n't depose the government without electing a new one at the same time . 
  under such a system even a minority government would remain in power , if the opposition parties could not agree to form a coalition . 
  this system was implemented to prevent a repeat of the weimar republic , in which governments were regularly removed by a parliament composed of a large number of parties which could never actually agree on anything besides votes of no confidence . 
  i was actually surprised when visiting western ukraine that , unlike older generations , some young adults could barely speak russian at all , despite russian being widely used in ukraine media . 
  was n't the last [ ankara election ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ankara_mayoral_election,_2014 ) considered rigged ? 
   total capacity of 16 ( ! ), 
  beds . 
  supposedly , germany has the capacity to treat 50 ebola patients at once . 
  heh , seen that way , should n't the netherlands be at the very bottom because of zwarte piet ? 
  have you ever thought why this is the case ? 
  hint : it 's abbreviated nato and ukraine is begging to join it to also live in that safe and peaceful world . 
  yeah , it sucks , but the organisation has to finance itself somehow . 
  they do n't accept sponsors and get only a relatively small amount of state support , so they do have to sell their results . 
  but it 's generally easy to at least find out the best rated products through media reports on the test results . 
  the stiftung warentest ( highly regarded german consumer testing organisation ) regularly tests vacuums , always coming to [ the same conclusion  ( http://www.test.de/staubsauger-im-test-1838262-0/ ) wattage is in no way related to sucking power . 
  driving up wattage is just a cheap marketing trick at the expense of the environment , which is why the eu decided to regulate it to stop the practice . 
  if someone seriously has problems getting animal hair out , get a better designed vacuum or buy an electrical brush ending for their existing one . 
  what people often do n't realize is that the whole ukrainian conflict is happening in a [ very small part of the country . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:ukrainian_presidential_election_2014_map.png ) for ninety percent of the population life goes on as usual . 
  there will need to be a lot of rebuilding in donbass , but it wo n't be an insurmountable problem for the country . 
  ukraine has demonstrated incredible resilience in this trial by fire . 
  despite widespread unrest , an invasion by a neighbouring country and a government that abandoned its responsibilities , they managed to keep the country together , hold free and fair elections and push back the seperatists . 
  i was actually quite disturbed when i first made that connection . 
  we had been taught in school that the stalin note was a trick that adenauer was smart enough to see through . 
  that it was either a lie or a way to rob us of our allied protection . 
  tellingly , austria was never mentioned in our history book . 
  so when i stumbled upon information about austria 's post-wwii history i first realized that twisting history is not something limited to ` evil ' authoritarian states . 
  interestingly , germany was [ offered the same deal ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stalin_note ) , but chancellor adenauer declined , and thus germany was divided for 40 years . 
  guantanamo looks like a tropical paradise compared to a normal russian prison . 
  also , i highly doubt anyone would like the americans to leave for the foreseeable future , considering recent events ... 
  article : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/11035401/russian-armoured-vehicles-and-military-trucks-cross-border-into-ukraine.html, 
  [ some context ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glory_to_ukraine ) : it 's a popular slogan from ukraine 's historical fight for independence . 
  until recently it was more associated with right-wing nationalists , but that has changed somewhat due to a renewed sense of nationhood , born from the struggle against russian influence . 
  using ode an die freude as an opening at the olympics or as a birthday song does not in any way demonstrate that it symbolizes the german nation . 
  in any case , in the modern setting , ode an die freude is widely known as the [ anthem of europe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anthem_of_europe ) . 
  in germany , it 's played as such every night - together with the national anthem - at midnight on the national broadcast radio . 
  the upper courts have been applying it more rarely in recent times , but people are still terrified of it . 
  case in point , they just turned off internet access completely at my university 's residence hall because of it . 
  the current government promised to address the issue , but with the geriatrics in power and media lobbying i would expect the situation to become even worse instead of better . 
  just offer free lodging and an open invitation and / r/powerwashingporn will take care of the rest . 
  here 's the rest , so it 's actually six dead novaja gazeta journalists already : http://cpj.org/killed/2000/igor-domnikov.php no wiki article :( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yuri_shchekochikhin http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anastasia_baburova http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/natalya_estemirova, 
  nobody was forced out of the elections . 
  from the [ osce report  ( http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/ukraine/120549?download=true )  the cec registered candidates in accordance with legal provisions and in a largely inclusive manner . 
  symonenko himself was on the ballot , too . 
  [ he received 1.51 % .
