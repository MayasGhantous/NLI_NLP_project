  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_presidential_election,_2014#results ) -- off-topic : just found this in the osce footnotes :  the cec closely scrutinized the application of nominee darth o. vader . 
  it decided that his supporting documents and his electoral programme did not comply with the legal requirements and referred the matter to the prosecutor regarding potentially falsified documents . 
   we saw what happened during the presidential elections . 
  what did we see ? 
  the ukrainian presidential election had [ a 60 % voter turnout ] ( http://rbth.com/news/2014/05/26/ukrainian_presidential_election_turnout_tops_60_percent_-_chief_election_36931.html ) , excluding [ the 10 % of voters ] ( http://tsn.ua/vybory-2014/vybory-prezidenta/lishe-tretina-viborciv-donbasu-zmozhut-progolosuvati-25-travnya-eksperti-351172.html ) who did not have access to polling stations due to the conflict . 
  that 's almost 20 points more than the european parliament election . 
  the election itself was fair and transparent . 
  the osce [ issuing a positive report ] ( http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/ukraine/120549 ) , concluding :  [ the election ] was characterized by high voter turnout and the clear resolve of the authorities to hold what was a genuine election largely in line with international commitments and with a respect for fundamental freedoms in the vast majority of the country . 
   this was despite the hostile security environment in two eastern regions and the increasing attempts to derail the process by armed groups in these parts of the country . 
  by the way , i was present in western ukraine during the election and witnessed active campaign advertisement , an open discussion on candidates on tv and in print and a well-organised voting procedure . 
  only a [ small portion of ukraine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:ukrainian_presidential_election_2014_map.png ) was held by seperatists during the election . 
  it 's estimated that just [ 10 % of the voting population ] ( http://tsn.ua/vybory-2014/vybory-prezidenta/lishe-tretina-viborciv-donbasu-zmozhut-progolosuvati-25-travnya-eksperti-351172.html ) was not able to vote . 
  it would n't . 
  since green energy sources do not provide a stable base supply and nuclear power will remain stable / be reduced in the future , we would need to switch to coal . 
  compared to coal , gas is a very clean energy source . 
  in fact , we could save a lot of greenhouse gases and reduce polution considerably if we were to switch all coal plants to gas . 
   revolted away ( crimea revolted ? 
  the whole crimean mess started the morning when * little green men * occupied the crimean parliament . 
  it was completely quiet before that . 
  afterwards , they replaced the government with a pro-russian one , blockaded ukrainian state installations and forced everyone out . 
  how can this be called a `` revolt '' ? 
  if you look at the article , yougov did ask several questions , one of which was whether the person believed in the existance of human rights in general . 
  what i find even more frightening though were a few questions from [ the full report ] ( http://cdn.yougov.com/cumulus_uploads/document/5a36trmrkq/internalresults_140718_human_rights_w.pdf ) : 50 % ( vs 37 % ) believe that suspected terrorists should not have a right to free speech . 
  what 's happening over there ? 
  wow , that reads like something out of national geographic . 
  the author 's talents are clearly wasted on confidential embassy dispatches that no-one probably ever reads . 
   gadzhi 's kaspiysk summer house is an enormous structure on the shore of the caspian , essentially a huge circular reception room -- much like a large restaurant -- attached to a 40-meter high green airport tower on columns , accessible only by elevator , with a couple of bedrooms , a reception room , and a grotto whose glass floor was the roof of a huge fish tank . 
   the heavily guarded compound also boasts a second house , outbuildings , a tennis court , and two piers out into the caspian , one rigged with block and tackle for launching jet skis . 
  why does this make me think of a bond villain 's lair ? 
  your statement may be true , though you can see my other post on my opinion about it . 
  but the incident you linked does not support your argument . 
  as the article itself describes , the famous linux backdoor was n't found because of the open nature of the code , but because one of the kernel 's developers noticed the traces of the break in . 
  the very clever obfuscation of the backdoor would probably have withstood general scrutiny otherwise . 
  this scenario could have played out exactly the same in the larger proprietary project ( though it probably would not have been made public ) . 
  you have to differentiate between intentional backdoors and the exploitation of unintentional bugs . 
  there 's no difference between open source ( os ) and proprietary code when it comes to bugs . 
  lousy programmers , bad style , lack of unit tests and fuzzy testing is not dependent on the nature of the code 's availability . 
  as openssl showed , even the most widely used os project 's code can look worse than a cs first year 's homework . 
  conversely , one may argue that code produced by paid programmers in * well-managed * corporations is safer , because they are bound by stringent rules of code-style , testing and documentation . 
  corporations can also direct programmers to focus on specific parts of a program that need work . 
  os on the other hand relies on the donation of labor by volunteers . 
  os projects lack the means of enforcement of any rules ( besides rejecting work ) and rely on programmers choosing what parts of a program they want to work on , which is not necessarily the part that needs fixing . 
  contrary , open source software should be more resistant to intentional backdoors , because the code is open for everyone to see , making them harder to hide . 
  in practice though , a backdoor in an os program will not be called ` getnsakey ( ) ` , but will masquerade itself as a non-obvious bug , to ensure complete deniability . 
  this is partly why heartbleed made people worry . 
  because if an intelligence agency had placed a backdoor in openssl , it would have looked exactly like that kind of bug . 
  one should also remember that in an os project , the adversary too has access to the code , making it easier to attack than an opaque program that has to be broken by trial and error . 
  in the end , it 's mostly a subjective matter . 
  people trust well-known os projects more when it comes to security . 
  but well-audited proprietary code can still be considered more secure than os code of a project nobody besides the programmers has ever looked upon . 
  the only winners in this are probably os projects managed by corporations , like android , which benefit from both openness and a corporate code culture .

  in response , heise security on [ wiretapping typewriters ] ( http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/spionage-so-hoerten-die-sowjets-schreibmaschinen-ab-2260408.html ) ( german ) . 
   national socialism or fascism in general was a force of its own , not simply a `` natural response '' to socialism . 
  i do n't doubt that the ideological ideas of ns existed on their own , but i posit that it would never have received the broad support and following necessary to topple governments if it had n't been seen as a somewhat extremist but controllable counterbalance to communism . 
   if national socialism was a reaction against the threat of communism it was one against the threat of communism within . 
  that 's true of course . 
  the conservative forces were afraid of a communist revolution , and not without reason . 
  the sailors ' revolution , the hamburg uprising and the bavarian soviet republic amply demonstrated the communist threat . 
  but this threat did n't exist in a vacuum . 
  the communist forces were supported and controlled by the su . 
  with the su in existence the conservative forces would never feel secure . 
   for every historical `` what if '' scenario there are always hundreds of factors undermining the theory . 
  it is effectively a pseudo science . 
  it may only be a pseudo science , but that applies to every ` science ' that ca n't be tested experimentally . 
  and anyway , it makes for a very interesting topic of discussion . 
  national socialism was a reaction to the threat of communism . 
  the movement was financed by industry and supported by the petite bourgeoisie who were terrified of the `` red manace '' . 
  if the bolsheviks had n't come to power in russia , there may never have been a strong nazi movement . 
  we may still have had another war , but it could have played out quite different , without the force of blind ideology driving the german forces . 
  in particular , there may not have been a reason to fight against russia in the first place . 
  a rational acting head of state would have been satisfied with the easing of reparations and return of land which the allies were ready for without war , as part of appeasement . 
   the rossiya crew had been taken to the scene of the shelling by taxi . 
  they were escorted by the self-defense forces in a village near lugansk and headed toward a local checkpoint . 
   the journalists wore no bulletproof vests or helmets http://rt.com/news/166496-journalist-dies-ukraine-shooting/ so they were hit while accompanied by insurgents , standing near a checkpoint that was under attack and they seem to have not worn the usual markings .

  **  be on reddit at least once per day to review the mod queue ** yes . 
  ** for the past four years , i 've been almost constantly on reddit . 
  and even when i 'm not , i get notifications on my smartphone for mail/modmail . 
   moderate at least one other community of 1,000 subscribers ** yes . 
  ** ( / r/falloutequestria ~ 2.000 subscribers , and some smaller ones ) ___  ** interview questions : ** #  do you have any experience with automoderator ( / r/automoderator ) , css or the mod toolbox ( / r/toolbox ) ? 
  ( not required ) ** yes . 
  ** we had quite a troll/spam problem in / r/falloutequestria , which i took care of by contracting the automoderator . 
  i also did the sub 's css , flairs and emote system , though i 'm by no means a css expert . 
  i have the toolbox installed on my home computer , mainly as a tool to quickly check the modqueue . 
   what timezone are you in , and when are you generally on reddit ? 
  ** berlin ** time zone . 
  i 'm generally on reddit the whole day , except the core night hours . 
   what is your favorite/least favorite thing about r/europe and what could be implemented to make it better ? 
  as others here have already pointed out , the weekly whiyc threads are probably the best part of the sub . 
  as a close second i like the diverse opinions from different countries/social spheres that gather here to discuss . 
  / r/europe truly feels like a cross-roads of cultures . 
  honestly , i like the sub as it is right now , which is the reason it has slowly became my favorite place to browse on reddit , and which is why i 'm writing the application right now . 
   what would make you a good moderator ? 
  i like the challange and duty responsibility brings with it . 
  i first became a moderator almost by accident , but took the challange head on and grew a * very * niche sub from some 200 subscribers to almost two thousand by investing a lot of time advertising it , adding interesting features and even supplying the content till the sub could stand on its own . 
  i am already constantly checking the / r/mod modque , even though it 's empty for me most of the time . 
  in fact i have been developing an android app that periodically checks the modque for new entries .
