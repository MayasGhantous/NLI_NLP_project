  there are banks of interpreters trying to translate , playing chinese whispers , and at least half the meaning gets lost . 
  every white color job nowadays demands for the applicant to speak english , why ca n't we expect the same from politicians representing us at an international organisation ? 
  linguistic pluralism has its place , citizens should be able to write to eu institutions in their native language , but within the organisation using english would streamline a lot of processes , reduce an enormous waste of taxpayer money and improve decision making . 
  seriously though , this is a debate between politicians who want to become the head of an international organisatition . 
  they will have to speak english the whole day , every day should they be elected to this post . 
  the least of all qualifications i would expect from a eu president is the ability to explain their basic political ideas in the world 's lingua franca . 
  that 's because of [ other similar treaties .

  honestly , it 's like reading news from arstotzka . 
  this weekly thread is the only reason i even know nkr exists . 
  for those who do n't know : the first poster is a reference to a popular [ `` euromyth '' ] ( http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ecintheuk/euromyths-a-z-index/ ) about the [ eu regulating the curvature of cucumbers . 
  ] ( http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ecintheuk/ec-to-ban-curved-cucumbers/ ), 
   russia have basically done in crimea what the ` west ' did in ukraine but with less subtlety and less bloodshed . 
  are you seriously comparing a military invasion with a popular revolution ? 
   so russia is bad for wanting a russian version of the eu . 
  except you know ... the eu does n't need force or threats for countries to want to join them . 
  you are seriously twisting the meaning . 
  if they wanted to ask that they would have . 
  as the question was posed , the respondent does n't have to agree with the decision , only express his understanding of the reasons behind it , which is evident in the disparity between the answer to this question and to the direct ones . 
  and hey , the past months have been a really good demonstration how obsolete nato has become . 
   oh , and if russia is no threat anymore then there is n't any reason to fear a first strike , right ? 
  btw , if the russian spetznaz had just distributed hotdogs to the crimeans , i do n't think anyone would have complained . 
  can you actually read russian ? 
  i wo n't speculate as to why they posed the question like this , but they did . 
  anyway , they also asked several other questions and the respondents also directly stated with 46-36 that they favored the eu over the russian customs treaty . 
   i 'm sure those who got 50 % pension cuts are feeling the beginning of symbolic part of the association agreement alright ... yeah , cause that 's totally the eu 's fault ( which is trying to keep the ukraine from insolvency ) and has nothing to do with russia literally invading part of their country , doubling gas prices and sending provocateurs into the industrial east disrupting the economy . 
  the 48 % you are citing belong to the question whether yanukowitsh had * a * reason not to sign the agreement , not whether people approved of him not doing it . 
  the actually relevant is the next question which shows an overwhelming majority ( 55-27 ) favour a continuation of the talks . 
  nonetheless , the ukraine [ only signed the symbolic part of the association agreement ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26680250 ) to show solidarity in the face of the russian threat , the actually important part was left for after the election . 
  so every ukrainian will get their voice heard , well except those living under occupation ... 
  well , i guess we will never know what the crimeans would have chosen in a free and fair referendum . 
   let 's remind the number of troops never went above what was authorized by the partition treaty on the status and conditions of the black see fleet [ 1 ] signed between ukraine and russia . 
  that 's so dishonest , it 's almost comical . 
  did the treaty also give russia the right to storm the crimean parliament and depose the local government ? 
  did it give them the right to occupy the host country 's military bases ? 
  to scuttle a ship to block the harbor ? 
   and indeed , were n't the good conditions of the vote confirmed by neutral observers ? 
  there were no neutral observers present ( no osce monitors ) and the vote was a farce , since it did n't feature the option to stay in the ukraine . 
  the only options were the 1992 constitution ( independence ) or joining russia . 
  in any case , you ca n't call a referendum legitimate if occupiers turn off all independent tv stations , kidnap and torture pro-ukrainian activitists and institute a propaganda campaign based on fear and lies . 
   why are they removing russian delegates ' right to express their country 's views ? 
  they did n't remove their right to express their views , only their voting rights were suspended . 
  thank you for the copy . 
  it 's an interesting read but i would say it paints schmidt in an even worse light than the spon article . 
  he really does seen to be mentally stuck in the cold war . 
  he legitimizes the annexation by equating russia with the ussr , questions the legitimacy of the ukraine 's border , utters confusing nonsense about the ukraine having ceased to exist due to the revolution and does indeed disavow the ukraine 's status as a nation . 
  interestingly , schmidt belongs to the same generation as [ stepan bandera ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stepan_bandera ) , a famous ukrainian nationalist and resistance leader during wwii . 
  i wonder what he would have said to schmidt 's statements . 
  yep , i could n't believe it myself , but he seems to have truly lost it . 
  schmidt is 95 , he probably has n't even realized the soviet union does n't exist anymore . 
  that 's the only explenation i have for his claim that a ukrainian nation ( as opposed to a state ) does n't exist and that putin therefore has the right to take whatever he wants .

  he only ever appears when he has to act as a host for foreign first ladies and when he and merkel visit the theater in bayreuth . 
  so , who cares about the truth ? 
  who would you trust to report unbiasedly ? 
  england has a lot less at stake in crimea than russia , so yes , the bbc is probably more trustworthy . 
  conversely , would i trust them to report fairly about the falklands ? 
  no , but in the case of crimea they are definitely preferable to the outlets run by the very state that occupied the disputed territory . 
  besides , i just ca n't stand the ` we are surrounded by enemies and all our problems are the result of foreign agents ' mentality espoused by the russian state media . 
  the only sources for the article you linked are rt and itar-tass , both owned and controlled by the russian state . 
  i would n't trust a word they report on the referendum . 
  besides , with a [ voter turnout of 123 % ] ( http://www.dailydot.com/politics/crimea-referendum-123-percent-sevastopol/ ) , and a [ ballot that did not provide a `` no '' option ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26514797 ) , the whole referendum is a joke . 
  in that case she actually did it though ... 
  she does what the people want .

  diem reached bis position long before the third reich :  his career in national sport preceded the nazi regime by decades , and he was appointed to organize the 1936 games years before hitler decided to put his own indelible mark on the berlin competition . 
  his speech in front of the hj before the fall of berlin is another matter , but that has to be seen in the context of total war and an existential threat by an enemy who 's purported savageness had been elevated to almost mythical proportions . 
  actually , if you read the article you 'll notice that he was neither a nazi not a nazi sympathiser , indeed his wife and closest associates were jewish .
