   i 'm not some mafia cunt that 's exactly why you 'd want to appeal . 
  you do n't appeal because you think you are guilty . 
  / r/polandball, 
   what 's funny though : even within bavaria there 's separatist sentiment in [ franconia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franconia ) . 
  at least , [ they are well-armed ] ( http://www.frankonia.de ) . 
  i know this will cause some resentment , especially with our french friends , but in this day and age there is only one international lingua franca , and that is english . 
  i know four major languages and i have to say , english is definitely the easiest one to learn . 
  is it really too much to expect from politicians wanting to represent their electorate in a united europe to know english well enough to hold a political conversation in it ? 
  do we really have to coddle the parliamentarians by translating everything they say into 22 languages ? 
  i have been at some of these debates as an intern and you can listen to the live translation on the parliament 's webstream . 
  it 's really quite bad . 
  i know simultaneous translation is difficult , particularly when it has to go through an intermediary step first , since often enough the translator does n't understand the original language him/herself , but in any case the translations are usually patchy , hard to understand and sometimes just stop for half a minute and then try to catch up by summarizing everything in a single sentence . 
  if you ever have to deal with eu parliamentary debates , i recommend to everyone to only use the english translation since it 's usually the best . 
  just imagine how much more efficiently everything would run , how many misunderstandings avoided and how much money could be saved by having everybody speak a common language . 
  yeah , i 'm not sure they 'd pass the integrationstest to get citizenship . 
  me neither . 
  but it 's no wonder , these harbour areas have been [ abandoned for fifteen years now . 
  ] ( http://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/hamburg/hafen/geschichte/der-tschechen-hafen-in-hamburg-verfaellt,tschechenhafen101.html ) container ships do n't fit into the harbor basin and river shipping has become unprofitable compared to trucks . 
  they can move there , but they still wo n't be able to claim benefits as non-germans/english . 
  and if they come to work , there are a lot of companies desperate for people . 
   but what is even worse , is that many of these young males are syrians who leave the women and children behind in the danger . . 
  these men brave the dangerous crossing to europe because once they 've applied for asylum they can get their family flown in safely . 
  op is not describing a hypothetical situation , he 's describing the realities of the syrian civil war . 
  is n't that * your * fault and responsibility ? 
  should n't the spanish demand accountability , the spanish police investigate and spanish politicians implement tougher laws against corruption ? 
   what has europe done about it ? 
  nothing . 
  so what should europe have done ? 
  i do n't remember any country ceding police authority to brussels . 
  op is already complaining in this very post that it is too difficult to get access to eu funds due to anti-corruption measures . 
  or maybe you are willing to finance a eu that can station olaf inspectors in every hamlet across the eu ? 
  you do n't fix a trade surplus by reducing production . 
  can you even imagine what that would mean ? 
  you would crash the entire economy . 
  trade surpluses can only be realistically alleviated by stimulating internal demand . 
  there are different ways of doing it . 
  germany is currently increasing wages and importing ~ ~ people ~ ~ consumers , which will both help bring down the imbalance . 
  if you were to redesign the eu , it would most likely give germany more power not less . 
  the current setup is designed to undemocratically constrain germany 's power , giving smaller countries much more weight in the eu parliament , council and commission than their size would warrant . 
  again , benefits do n't have anything to do with shengen . 
  no benefits for non-germans has been the law for a long time . 
  it 's not exclusive to greeks , the case decided by the eu court was about [ a swedish woman being denied benefits in germany . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34256969 ) so if you give refugees passports , the only country they will be able to claim benefits in , is your own . 
  benefits do n't have anything to do with shengen . 
  as a non-german you do n't have a right to benefits in germany . 
  the european court just [ confirmed this as legal this week . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34256969 ) so your newly minted greeks would have no reason to go to germany in the first place . 
  once it becomes common knowledge that a greek passport is worthless in germany when it comes to benefits , you will have a lot of newly minted greeks rioting in athens and you ca n't even deport them . 
  so i would be very careful about unleashing that genie . 
  merkel already said that [ she wo n't apologize . 
  playing this stupid blame game brings us absolutely nothing . 
  yeah , rifles are difficult if you have a small flat , but if you 're only interested in handguns then you just need a small box that can be put in a wardrobe . 
  dae remember usenet before the eternal september ? 
  / u/rc -1262 's explanation was very simplified . 
  in germany you also have to reapply for every handgun and ( semi-automatic ) assault rifle . 
  the process is somewhat quicker than the first time , but you still need `` proof of need '' from your gun club each time you reapply . 
  he 's also not entirely correct about the number of handguns . 
  without demonstrating a special need , based on competitive activity , you are limited to two handguns and three semi-automatic rifles in germany . 
  if you have n't already , look into trying [ ipsc ] ( https://youtu.be/lpg-xg_mczi?t=73 ) . 
  it 's sport shooting on steroids and the closest german law allows us to practise `` practical '' shooting . 
  depending on where you live , it can be somewhat hard to find a club that has an ipsc section and you have to pass a special exam ( * sicherheits - und regeltest * ) , but once you 've tried it you 'll never want to go back to static shooting . 
  that 's not a quote . 
  that 's the author paraphrasing [ a long explanation by merkel ] ( http://www.rp-online.de/politik/deutschland/angela-merkel-das-grundrecht-auf-asyl-kennt-keine-obergrenze-aid-1.5383275 ) about the fact that the law does not allow you to reject refugee applications based on their numbers . 
  it does not mean that germany has to or will let unlimited numbers enter to make such an application . 
  in the same interview she says that countries have to follow the dublin agreement and that she 's working on a fair distribution system for the whole of europe . 
  that was a forecast , not an invitation . 
   tell all refugees that they can come to germany repeating that falsehood does n't make it true . 
  nope , because the minute one would become popular it would get * abgemahnt * into oblivion . 
  repeating falsehoods does n't make them true . 
  nobody ` invited ' them , foreign media just took some very selective quotes from long interviews to make it appear so . 
  no , merkel never said that . 
  she said that they ca n't legally refuse refugees based on their number , but there is nothing that would prohibit redistributing them afterwards . 
  nobody doubts the evils of the civil war , the cruelty of the whites is legendary to this day . 
  the interesting thing is not that lenin did bad things to win the civil war , it 's that by doing these things he betrayed the very ideals he was supposedly fighting for . 
  in the end it were the very measures taken to save the revolution that doomed it . 
  well , your argument regarding kronstadt boils down to `` that 's how you react to mutinies '' , ignoring that lenin claimed to lead a government of soldier and peasant sovjets . 
  and i did n't find anything in the argument chain adressing the fact , that lenin forbade `` factionism '' ( i.e. 
  disagreement with the leadership ) in the party and instituted the nomenclatura . 
  oh , herr kuchendieb , pray tell what you find unfair in my `` accusations '' . 
  xaxaxa , the lenin who ordered the violent suppression of the [ kronstadt rebellion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kronstadt_rebellion ) and afterwards implemented his own * gleichschaltung * of the party , laying the groundwork for the totalitarian su ? 
  a collective bargaining agreement ( tarifvertrag ) [ can be made universal ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/arbeitnehmer-entsendegesetz ) in germany by , among other things , a decree of the minister of labour . 
  this tool has mainly been used to protect the construction industry and cleaning services from eastern european wage-based competiton . 
  well , the lawyer has to defend him somehow , that 's her job . 
  she ca n't claim he 's innocent , as he 's been caught red handed , so she can only try to reduce the charge . 
  if she can throw enough doubt at his motivation to get them to drop the terrorism charge in favor of robbery , that would be the best case scenario for the accused . 
  case in point : [ the volgograd train station attack ] ( https://youtu.be/cuvsusikfyi ) specifically targeted the people queuing at the checkpoint just inside the entrance . 
  then you 'll like what the other putins have [ in plan for him . 
  ] ( http://www.theonion.com/graphic/putin-learns-putin-behind-plot-to-assassinate-puti-29315 ), 
  there 's a simple solution : every taxi driver needs to be licensed , why not prostitutes ? 
  introduce registration , regular medical checkups and require prostitutes to prominently display their licenses . 
  punish clients of unregistered sex workers . 
  the carrot ( medically safer prostitutes ) and the stick ( criminal law ) should create enough market pressure from the demand side to effectively eliminate forced trafficking . 
  yeah , for example polish media likes to spin tales about german child protection services `` kidnapping '' children because their parents spoke to them in polish . 
  [ klammeraffe did gain popularity in the 90s . 
  ] ( https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=klammeraffe&amp;year_start=1900&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=20&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3b%2cklammeraffe%3b%2cc0 ), 
   the admiral kuznetsov ( russia 's aircraft carrier ) has to [ be ] accompanied by tugboats . 
  [ would you like to know more ? 
  ] ( https://medium.com/war-is-boring/your-aircraft-carrier-is-a-piece-of-crap-f3f52d299588 ), 
  nah , just polish death camp . 
  we forgave them .
