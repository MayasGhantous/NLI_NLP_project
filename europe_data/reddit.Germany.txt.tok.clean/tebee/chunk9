  yeah , cause the professional burglars who specialize in high value targets will be deterred by you blurring years old photos in sv . 
  why are you in finland ? 
  come to germany !, 
  the it job market is crazy here in hamburg . 
  there are so many job offerings and so few qualified applicants that the company i work for has been unable to fill multiple openings , and it 's not due to lack of trying . 
  because nobody cares whether they draw sarkozy or not , but people blow a gasket when hebdo * dares * to not publish a mohammed in their new issue . 
  we have a right to our weekly mohammed caricature , damn you !, 
  just look at the reaction here , that 's all the context you need . 
   twice as much as the maximum an american president can hope she also has much less power than a us president . 
  * she 's not commander-in-chief ( except during a wwiii-type situation ) . 
  * she does not select nor appoint judges . 
  * she ca n't veto legislation . 
  * she ca n't issue executive orders , only broad policy guidelines . 
  * important questions have to be decided by the whole cabinet . 
  * in reality , she ca n't even select the ministers , as this is decided during coalition negotiations . 
  the chancellor 's true power lies in the allegiance of the parliament majority . 
  in that way they are more powerbrokers and coordinators than `` deciders '' . 
  problem is , just posting to facebook can be seen as non-private use , since you make it available to the public . 
   ask how the weekly witch-burning went . 
  yeah , who still does that ? 
  that 's [ so 90s . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/satanic_ritual_abuse ), 
  it 's exactly the other way around . 
  the ` eu government ' ( commission & parliament ) are for abolishing roaming charges . 
  it 's the national governments that have been successfully lobbied into blocking it . 
  the difference is , obama prosecuted government employees who violated their duty to confidentiality , not the journalists who were doing their jobs and exercising their right to free press . 
  a journalist has no duty to be loyal to his government , an official/soldier does . 
  so russia and texas are [ closer than i thought . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/eg6x-xtvask ), 
  source ? 
  cause that sounds like a misunderstanding . 
  the lissabon treaty expanded the rights of the parliament . 
  hey , no offense mate , but you did vote for staying under the english yoke . 
  just call it england , everybody does it anyways . 
  have n't you heard ? 
  [ capitalism apparently kills .

  oh noes , two diplomats do their job and talk about their opinions concerning foreign politicians and their strategies . 
  it must be a conspiracy !, 
  the phone calls revealed nothing more than diplomats doing diplomacy . 
  the only `` surprise '' was to hear them talk frankly instead of in diplomatic terms . 
  lenin was , lenin is , lenin will eat . 
  dunno about cameron , but merkel has pretty low visibility domestically . 
  she is kinda famous for never commenting on issues until a consensus has been reached , so her ministers enjoy a lot more airtime . 
  when merkel is shown in german news , it 's usually in the context of international relations , so she might very well disappear unnoticed till people start wondering why she has n't phoned putin recently . 
   juncker said he had no intention of visiting the uk when he was running for commissioner , i doubt he 'll bother now . 
  juncker was specifically [ told not to campaign in the uk by the labour party . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/07/uk-may-have-no-say-eu-top-job ), 
  there 's a recent co-production between sweden , danemark and germany called [ the bridge ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_bridge_%28danish/swedish_tv_series%29 ) ( not to be confused with [ the other bridge ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/die_br%c3%bccke_%28film%29 ) ) , about a crime that happened on the \u00d6resund bridge , right on the border . 
  it 's actually pretty well-made and not your usual sunday night murder . 
  it 's on [ eu netflix . 
  ] ( http://www.netflix.com/wimovie/70254188 ), 
  i was talking about the ikea bike linked above , not the consulate one . 
  are we looking at different bikes ? 
  i see absolutely no lights on that bike . 
  and no reflectors on the spikes either . 
  wait , that thing 's not street legal !, 
  it has no light !, 
  in this case it 's not the general insult law that matters but the [ special one for foreign heads of state . 
  there are no records of this law being enforced in recent times . 
  they do n't even know which government agency is resposible for handling it . 
  have you looked at these `` documents '' ? 
  those are very basic esl mistakes , not something from a spy movie . 
  tovarish , you have to use [ calendar of glorious russian faith , ] ( https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=today+in+julian+calendar ) not the heretical imperialistic one . 
   how is this dooming ukraine ? 
  because this agreement , while little known in the west , has huge symbolic value for ukraine . 
  this agreement is what the people on the maidan [ protested for . 
  ] ( http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/234303.html ) it 's what the `` cyborgs '' of donestsk gave their life for . 
  it 's what the army and volunteer battalions defend daily in the east . 
  signing this agreement strengthens and solidifies the position of the pro-western reformers in the country . 
  its defeat would mean a huge victory for the pro-russian side and a possible return to the old client-state ways down the road , just as happened with the orange revolution . 
  was n't the conflict between turkey and the pkk largely peaceful in recent years , till erdogan deliberately restarted it to win the election ? 
  not according to [ reporting by spiegel ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/russland-das-verfahren-gegen-nadija-sawtschenko-ist-ein-schauprozess-a-1083122.html ) : supposedly both cellphone data and photographs of her arrest prove she could not have participated in the shelling she is accused of . 
  if you really want to argue like that , then no , * obviously * ukrainian weapons did not destroy any part of the airport during poroshenko 's term as president . 
  since his soldiers were defending the airport against outside attackers , they were firing away from it . 
  only the seperatists were firing at the building . 
  so `` objectively '' putin `` has sole of the blame '' for destroying the airport . 
  because it 's nonsense . 
  poroshenko [ was n't even in office ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27745278 ) during the [ first battle of donetsk airport ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_battle_of_donetsk_airport ) , when ukrainian forces recaptured the airport from seperatists . 
  he was in office during the [ second battle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_battle_of_donetsk_airport ) , but that was a continued assault by seperatist forces on defending ukrainian ones , so there 's no way to blame poroshenko for that . 
  they invited the countries that are ready to work together . 
  greece will never support a move to limit the flow of refugees and germany ... is germany . 
  you know you are doing something wrong when people prefer nazi germany over you . 
  so , what does that have to do with the question at hand ? 
  the hesse constitution still prescribes the death penalty , but the federal ban supersedes state laws . 
  union law supplanting national law , supplanting state law , supplanting local law is a long established principle and people on all levels have always been grumbling about decisions from higher up . 
   yeah that 's when they get into the hoc to vote . 
  just like in the eu . 
  national governments come together in the eu council and vote , using a system of double majority , which actually provides the minority with more protection than your hoc does . 
  there 's also the eu parliament , on which merkel has very little influence . 
  if you believe merkel can just single-handedly `` go on a maverick rampage '' in the eu , you really should read less sun . 
  so the danish government does n't have layers ? 
  or do you elect every mid-level bureaucrat ? 
  no matter how many layers , eu laws are proposed by the commission , headed by commissioners selected by member states and approved by parliament , amended and voted upon by the council , representing elected national governments , and the parliament , directly elected . 
  could it be more democratic ? 
  of course . 
  but the real problem are national politicians , who like to blame the eu as a scapegoat for everything wrong , no matter that they agreed to it in the council . 
  they ca n't ? 
  good thing parliament does n't exist , or those damned non-local mps could band together and vote on a law affecting your constituency . 
  do you vote in all constituencies in your home country , or just the one you reside in ?
