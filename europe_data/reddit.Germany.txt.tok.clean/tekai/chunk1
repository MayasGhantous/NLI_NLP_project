they def are . 
  you should look up their stuff on youtube , like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgpgsycreja, 
  err no . 
  the article says it was scrapped in 1933 and reintroduced in 1939 to finance the war , esp . 
  the submarine fleet . 
  it says nothing about the submarine fleet of the frg . 
  if you check the center of the picture , you 'll notice it 's actually hamburg from space, 
  apparently she 's taking both jobs seriously , still weird, 
  how about `` not really comparable '' ? 
  one side intentionally , order to do so by the head of state , spied on the government for years . 
  the other side accidentally spied on the foreign minister when spying on terrorists and deleted the records w/o informing their own government and then instituted a policy of deleting such stuff immediately w/o the agencies upper management . 
  the other side only found about this through their double agent . 
  but this is only government stuff , lets not forget that someone as been indiscriminately collecting information on every on the internet incl . 
  their own citizens . 
  what actually seems comparable is the bnd spying on turkey . 
  little green men, 
  did you read the article ? 
  it does talk about what they did , like merging kindergardens , firing the ceo & 200 people at a local utility company etc. 
  well , the kiev government was elected in free & fair elections for starters and they 're ukrainians , the same ca n't be said for the separatists in the east . 
  the tallinn city government & the estonian government do n't really like each other, 
  hm afaik opinion polls see her at less than 10 % whil poroshenko is at 50 + %, 
  basically this , a european country with solvable issues . 
  now it regressed to an imperialist state which does stupid things to be `` respected '', 
  but they can as libreoffice is free , ms can improve support for odf ( but the other way round its not possible ) , for forms you can use pdfs etc. 
  do you think he 'll have a chance to stay after 2015 ? 
   gripen 's are well manoeuvrable and good in dogfights though , however that will rarely happen nowadays . 
  given that the uk is a f-35 customer you better hope so . 
  they have the right to 25k troops in their bases but not for walking around armed encircling ukrainian barracks and asking them to hand over weapons , blocking streets and occupying infrastructure . 
  some more , mostly german https://twitter.com/golinehatai ard reporter ( german ) https://twitter.com/bbcdaniels not reporting from the ukraine , but about it https://twitter.com/demmerich n-tv/rtl https://twitter.com/smirnova_welt die welt https://twitter.com/steffendobbert die zeit , do n't know if he 's reporting from within the ukraine, 
  well estonia & finland just signed an agreement on building seperate lng terminals and estonia has shale oil . 
  that was a wtf moment for me , thought they 're like spain, 
  hm sounds similar to mr. savisaar in tallinn, 
  captain_englishs [ reply ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/britishproblems/comments/1t6e1p/the_porn_block_is_bad_but_the_real_tragedy_will/ce512ao ) to your post is well worth a read too ( as you already note ), 
  because that 's the only possibility ... 
  better than the catalan log, 
  heh storbritannien , more like st\u00f6rbritannien ( from german st\u00f6ren , disrupt ) , 
  but hands , mouths & hair ? 
  pls fix and resubmit, 
  how about finnish then , ~ 5mil people and makes it easier to understand estonian , 
  are you studying estonian or planning to ? 
  you somehow forgot to link the video, 
  indeed but our tf2 version is better imho, 
  hm afaik the article is imho a bit weak on two points . 
  according to the news reports i heard this is n't going to be a eu ban , but currently rules forbid banning plastic bags . 
  that rule is going to be relaxed so individual members can ban them . 
  the other issue is which kind of bags . 
  the article says `` single use '' and afaik this means those really thin bags you get to transport fruits , vegetables or a kebab . 
  while i do understand the issue and agree that they 're bad i wonder how to replace them . 
  well yes it is possible to not see him in a positive light and i certainly do understand the necessity to differentiate between him and what the nsa did . 
  but that does n't make him a traitor . 
  and while greenwald might be playing fast & loose at times , he 's not the only person working on these articles , nor is he the publisher . 
  there is an editorial process which involves more than just him . 
  but both those things are missing the point a bit , like it does n't matter that his girlfriend was a stripper . 
  you 're drinking too much of your gov 's kool-aid . 
  he did n't dump secrets into the public , stuff that get 's released has been carefully selected . 
  it 's not just that it 's unethical by his standards , some of the stuff he revealed is simply illegal and possibly unconstitutional . 
  there 's even the possibility that he has n't committed treason at all . 
  to the mighty ibex !, 
  yeah what happened in belarus ? 
  could n't you just have copied the much shorter bbc headline ? 
  seriously lithuania , klaip\u0117da & butinge are your only ports ? 
  it really looks like former communist countries on the baltic sea did n't want too many ports . 
  uhm , i do n't really like this . 
  when talking about banning smoking/tobacco everybody immediately thinks of cigarettes and their health hazards . 
  and while they 're probably the biggest users of tobacco there are other uses of tobacco : - pipes - hookahs - cigars all those are afaik used a lot less often and usually smell a lot more pleasant . 
  a tobacco ban would make these illegal too . 
  ( disclaimer i sometimes smoke a pipe but do n't like cigarettes ), 
  ofc it is , how about some [ salty herrings ] ( http://www.katjes.com/our-products/salzige-heringe/ ) or [ piratos ] ( http://www.salmiyuck.com/2010/09/haribo-piratos.html ), 
  hey , we north germans love liquorice too !, 
  i have to support cvt , tannz\u00e4pfle  astra , imho astra mainly causes headaches . 
  there is at least one, 
  reminds me of [ this ad ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnfe-nr-ex4 ) , only the reverse, 
  ha , only city in the list to get a special mention, 
  another moron who does n't know that it 's an easy mistake to make ... 
  please do n't insult other users, 
   the same author would whine about how all the regulations are stifling the economy . 
  well if they are stifling & manage to destroy the business then yes . 
  it 's not like all regulations are good . 
  but afaik the economist mostly likes to point at the [ icelandic success ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/12798518 ), 
  how could you mix up your neighbours ? 
  it does n't . 
  georgia left in 2009 and the baltic states were never in it . 
  hmm , pies , fish & chips etc. 
  * 1066 battle of hastings * though generally their cuisine is bad , i love the english breakfast with bacons & beans * wait , that 's england , easy to mix them up * churchill * the sun still does n't set * great tv shows like dr. who , peep show , the it crowd , top gear , the thick of it, 
  [ russification ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russification ), 
  how is russia protecting its trade routes by telling the ukraine not to join the eu ? 
  afaik russia is trading with both and its very unlikely the ukraine will trade much less with russia given its proximity .

  thank you a lot !, 
  yes , that would be nice, 
  i feel my homestate/city is under represented , even / r/polandball has a hamburg flair, 
  just move the setting to spain/france ? 
  and you 're set, 
  estonia gets it right , it does n't discriminate between those who it does discriminate against . 
  what does territorial integrity mean ? 
  i ca n't quite comprehend how spain can use it to lay claim to gibraltar . 
  heresy !, 
  i do n't know any dialects so i can only talk about standard finnish which i 've been taught and that had no future tense as such . 
  instead you have to express it semantically as in i will be there tomorrow . 
  but afaik that 's just the standard and not what is spoken in daily life .
