  twisting it a little more , no sex either, 
   conan o'brien resembles the president not anymore , sauli_niinist\u00f6 was elected last year after conan err tarjas final term,

   virtually unheard-of uh lidl and others ? 
  opposition from the employer is n't the norm , but unheard of is imho a bit of a stretch . 
  i welcome our new german austro-slovenian overlords , but why did we let our islands in the baltic sea secede ? 
  given the downvotes , what should be the used to interact with the government ? 
  and how come you have to use the free services of fb/twitter to interact with the government ? 
  you really should make state run tv your only source for information from the government, 
  ah , that explains estonia at 0.37 while its president is fairly active, 
  was this made by you ? 
  can we see the data behind it , which accounts were included etc. 
   the world wide web , invented at cern in 1989 by british scientist tim berners-lee , has grown to revolutionize communications worldwide http://home.web.cern.ch/about/birth-web the net was created by darpa , the web by cern , kinda, 
  i 'm sure they 're having a laugh about it whenever somebody brings that up, 
   toomas hendrik ilves @ilvestoomas  precedents exist err . . medievally : formosus , pope 891 to 896 , was posthumously tried by his political enemies in the so-called cadaver synod, 
  you use numbers ? 
  that 's weird to me . 
  we simply add an e like k\u00e4se -  kaese, 
  what do you use instead of \u00f6 , \u00e4 and \u00f5 ? 
  i ca n't comment the quality of their estonian counterparts , but err & postimees seem more reputable have more articles than bbn . 
  what 's your impression ? 
  estonia recently got a new english site : http://news.postimees.ee/, 
  pretty much the same here , the golden days of adventures when you actually had to type words helped my english skills tremendously, 
  like the brits have n't done this before ...  after the end of world war ii , the allies sold captured enigma machines , still widely considered secure , to a number of developing countries . 
  the russian military supposedly used them for some time too , not knowing that the code was broken ... 
   i find it very disconcerting that as a left winger you would rush to such a knee jerk defense of western corporate owned media . 
  for me there is little distinction between western policy and western media . 
  they go hand in hand , as the media is the mouth piece for imperialist policies . 
  please stop thinking in black and white misguided by some ideology , it helps no one, 
  style over substance , a pity you do n't have die partei in . ch , you would love their `` inhalte \u00fcberwinden '' motto, 
  nbs given that they needed the bailout to pay their debts ... 
  thanks, 
   please sign in i do n't want to , can someone c & p the text here ? 
  so you would like a policeman on every corner ? 
  have n't you seen the police statistics posted earlier , finland is literally a police state , outrageous, 
  a another comparison from the economist : [ the holy roman empire : european disunion done right ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/christmas/21568659-old-empire-offers-surprising-lessons-european-union-today-european-disunion-done ), 
  for all we know it could be the flag of berlin, 
  eh , that 's confusing, 
  the submitted title is really really misleading, 
  somebody did n't study his tufte, 
  come one nobody is of rich enough to simply give away potatoe , is preposterous, 
  for some people it makes sense to give them food handouts/vouchers instead of money which could be spent on stuff not that essential, 
  i 'll one up you and say they wo n't even pass the 5 % hurdle, 
  i 'm not contesting that later they tightened the limits , but you apparently have no clue how referencing works . 
  so lets try something different . 
  please explain what [ regulation 297/2011 ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexuriserv/lexuriserv.do?uri=oj:l:2011:080:0005:0008:en:pdf ) does and why it references the older chernobyl regulations . 
  it does n't matter when the chernobyl regulation expired . 
  what they did was say something like `` for the actual numbers refer to page 5 '' but instead of `` page 5 '' it was and older regulation . 
  i mean why else did they reference those regulations ? 
  no , because it 's all in there . 
  after fukushima drafted a new regulation allowing higher levels radiation for produce from japan . 
  they based those levels on an old regulation for chernobyl . 
  but instead of simply copying the old numbers they simply referenced them as hausgeist already said . 
  that the old regulations had an expiry date and only applied to stuff near chernobyl does n't matter , because the new regulation is about fukushima and only uses the radiation levels in them . 
  the rest of those regulations can be ignored . 
  they actually loosened the limits and only later tightened them , the op is right . 
  woah woah , the dutch ca n't claim frisia solely for themselves . 
  east and north frisia are in germany . 
  so it 's even possible to keep your own culture etc. 
  across borders, 
  swiss ... weird secretive people, 
  hmm [ cornershop ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm7h0oov_o8 ), 
  well if you compare it like that , it 's 68 years since '45, 
  it 's not complete bs , they would have to renegotiate to stay/rejoin the common market . 
  and if that does n't work/isn ' t desired , they could try bilateral agreements . 
  i do expect the uk to do that , but it 's a matter of when and how much the eu is willing to give . 
  that was n't indonesia either ... 
  go on ... 
  seriously ?? 
  germany and estonia differ very much in their views on privacy/it security . 
  my impression is that estonians just trust their government and let it do a lot online in central databases and also do a lot of business online with a debit/cc card . 
  germany not so much . 
  we 're one of the most untrusting ppl regarding anyone handling/having our data . 
  we kicked the electronic voting machines out again . 
  we like paying by cash ( at least for smaller items , groceries ) . 
  a another difference might be that estonia might not have to deal with legacy systems so much but started with a relatively clean slate . 
  relevant satw : http://satwcomic.com/epic-battle, 
  exactly , hrodlands comment certainly deserved the downvotes but hammymans not so much . 
  you 're forgetting switzerland . 
  it 's not that unusual , hungarians & finns call their countries magyarorsz\u00e1g & suomi . 
  poor non-us countries then , being so irrelevant they should just shut up and take it in silence, 
  that would make it impossible for germany to get a seat so of course we could not accept it , unless we manage a compromise and the person who gets sent there is always a german . 
  imho not an important issue . 
  the eu needs to work better on its united foreign policies before getting veto powers . 
  ( imho the vetos are a bad thing ), 
  here you go  aides to hollande said paris was in no hurry to strike a deal this week . 
  `` france has time until 2014 , '' they said . 
  paris 's biggest issue is a proposed cut of around $ 60bn in the common agricultural policy compared with the seven years until 2013 and that fact that france now funds around a quarter of the uk rebate . 
   `` the united kingdom is paying less than its wealth , france more , '' said a senior french official . 
  `` france pays a billion of the 4bn cost of the british rebate . '', 
   both the germans and french appear sanguine about the prospects of stalemate and failure over the next few days , with paris incensed at being the biggest contributor to the british rebate and the germans anxious about having to pay more to finance the eu . 
  +3 $ for 3d +2 $ because it 's so long, 
  that was meant as a joke  `` sending fake passports '' is a very poor explanation for ~ 1k movies per year, 
  you 're too pessimistic , opposing france is something germany likes the uk for , and the smaller/newer states like being supported by one of the big three . 
  the key is to win allies so the uk does n't stand alone . 
  they need those to ship movies so they can send dvd boxes with fake passports in them to spain ( source : documentary about customs at frankfurt airport ), 
  reducing the cap while allocating more to the newer members to gain some allies might help too, 
   we 're in the schengen hahaha good joke , ireland and the uk are not part of the schengen area . 
  source : [ schengen_area : eu member states with opt-outs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schengen_area#eu_member_states_with_opt-outs )  unsubstantiated . 
  my claim or their lies ?
