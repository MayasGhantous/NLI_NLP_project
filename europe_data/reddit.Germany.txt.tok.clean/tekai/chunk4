  turkish & romanian , are backed by nation as the official language , as a place to live , where millions of people use it and cultural products such as books , movies & newspapers are released . 
  bilingualism is very much possible even for the village idiots . 
  bavarian , swiss german ( not languages but different enough that i in northern germany ca n't understand them ) are still alive and i presume most speakers could talk and definitively understand hochdeutsch , it might not be perfect but enough to converse . 
  if you really want to learn more about bi - / trilingualism take a closer look at romania/hungary ( which german schools too , a friend from there wound up trilingual ) or swedish in finland , mixed with english . 
  what minority languages imho need is state backing ( schools , official language status ) , a big enough peer group ( for day to day use outside the home and literature ) and a sufficient social prestige ( for parents wanting/not objecting that their kids learn it ) . 
  with those things even idiots should be able to command two or more languages . 
  europe would be doomed , no sex , no future, 
  ... you 're right their investment division sits in london and the [ former head is now their ceo ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anshu_jain ), 
  probably , but they were founded in 1972, 
   ryanair [ micheal o'leary talks about his issues with the eu ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4hyssrlcq8 ), 
  this diversity can be an advantage too . 
  take [ groupon/mycitydeal ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mycitydeal ) for example . 
  groupon started as a us company and focussing on that market almost exclusively . 
  mycitydeal copied their idea launched in germany but quickly expanded into other countries . 
  in the us groupon was king , but internationally it was mycitydeal . 
  so while groupon was a bit pissed because of the copied idea , they bought them anyways to acquire the international business & experience .

  currently i think a frog is befitting . 
  things are slowly heating up but the frog does n't react until it is too late . 
   reeperbahn never ever give away your credit card , do n't let your dick do the thinking . 
   fallen madonna with the big boobies fyp, 
  i ca n't find numbers atm , but a significant part of the funding for part those projects should come from the eu cohesion fund, 
  out of curiosity , why did you think t-mobile is n't true german ? 
  as is the germany anthem , it 's a drinking song `` german women , ... german wine '' and the melody is originally from the ( hre/austrian ) emperors song . 
  why does it have to be enforced ? 
  it 's illegal and you can be sued for piracy . 
  it 's not enforced for books or cds either . 
  imho it 's not a `` new '' issue , there already is piracy , and there is already a lot of drm etc to enforce the use of only licensed software . 
  re : licenses as i understand it the ruling is about those . 
  when you buy a software you mainly buy the license to use it and when you do n't need it anymore you can sell that license . 
  not yet , but it 's coming next year but atm we already have to pay for pcs . 
  i 'm more surprised that the dog is still alive, 
  hm to me they 're in a different color , but regardless they 're in the same family , although , as said , quite distant, 
  wait they did what ? 
  do you have an article or so on that ? 
   the final german loan repayment was made in 1971 downvotes for all of you, 
  so you are against the way it 's currently done in germany , amtshilfe ? 
  i think it 's good , but now that we do n't draft anymore it 's probably better to invest more into thw etc. 
   france , london city states ? 
  germany is n't all l\u00e4nder . 
  berlin , bremen & hamburg are cities with their own representation, 
  for them we 're all saxons : saksamaa, 
  my wild guess as to why you were taught about it is that finland suffered a similar fate , losing parts of karelia , viipuri etc. 
  ( twice ) and thus having to deal with refugees from those areas . 
  i did n't know about the finnish concentration camps , but then it 's somewhat non-suprising as my impression is that everybody who got a chance ran some . 
   also it only went east and there is no scattering in the west . 
  i guess it 's simply explained a political map of that time : [ europe 1914 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:map_europe_alliances_1914-en.svg ) as you can see , eastern europe as it is now simply did n't exist . 
  even the states between austria & turkey only ( re - ) gained their independence in the 19th century . 
  while in the west only belgium was relatively new . 
  france and the netherlands were nation states for a long time , even `` possessing '' ( incl . 
  belgium ) colonies around the world . 
  the east was split between the multi-ethnic empires of germany , austria and russia . 
  although north-west germans and dutch people certainly did/do understand each other the idea of being of a different nationality was much stronger in the west where you had nation of your own . 
  after having studied finnish i came to the conclusion it 's best to start with estonian , afterwards every other european language will be easier . 
  hfs , they 're reminding me of deutschmark , very similar design & colors imho, 
  one of the tweets by ilves : https://twitter.com/ilvestoomas/status/210475404526501888, 
  it think atm it 's not that suprising . 
  merkel managed to stay clear of scandals , looks like a saint amongst sinners in the current euro crisis and the opposition has n't been able to challenge her . 
  unless things change drastically she 'll probably stay for a 3rd term next year . 
  tbh , pics of policemen with mps in other countries seem scarier to me, 
  ever heard of free to play ? 
  you can download and play for free , but once you want certain items , compete on a higher level or just want a fancy avatar you have to pay a modest fee . 
  at least for mmo/online games it seems to work . 
  a slightly different but old method is shareware , keen 1 was free and fully playable but you had to pay for keen 2 & 3 . 
  but i do n't think the pirates want to force anyone to offer their stuff for free but rather to accept the reality that sharing will never go away and that users should n't be criminalized but given incentives to buy stuff and support artists/developers/products they like . 
   skype was founded in 2003 by janus friis from denmark and niklas zennstr\u00f6m from sweden . 
  the skype software was developed by estonians ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skype#history, 
  the grammar in that article confuses me, 
  i 'm not sure those places are a good argument . 
  look at the european democracies at the start of the 20th century and what happend after a few years and yet one of the worst offenders became a model democracy afterwards . 
  imho you ca n't just install democracy or libertarianism and expect it to work when people/society have not grown used to the ideas of it and that it might happen to them . 
  most/all third world states got their independence in the last two centuries and were managed by an elite white society before that . 
  european states & america had a lot of time to develop and exchange ideas about democracy etc. 
   different groups have been calling out against this proposal in the media and on facebook for some time now , it 's become a pretty big issue and i 'd say it 's pretty obvious the general public are against the idea . 
  that perplexes me somewhat , the article says participation was low yet you say it 's a big issue with several groups speaking out against it . 
  so unless officials are lying it was n't a big enough issue for ppl to actually go and vote on it . 
  my guess is that there are a few loud voices against it ( maybe more outside tallinn ) , ~ 51k support it and ~ 348k do n't care . 
  the self proclaimed spa\u00df-partei dug its own grave . 
  by supporting cronyism and elitism instead of liberalism . 
  by appointing the wrong people to the wrong posts ( westerwelle , niebel ) . 
  i would love to support a lib party , but not the fdp . 
  grml spam blogs, 
  at least angie is still alive https://twitter.com/#!/angela_d_merkel,

  this is wikipedia , go and edit/improve the map the map, 
  nah , all we have canceled plans and a test track . 
  the only german built maglev trains are operating in china, 
  it 's a news report about a study conducted by an independent international group of experts . 
  it 's exactly not tabloid shit , if you want to form your opinion of it ( it 's not just hitler , hitler , hitler etc. ), 
  and can read german here 's the link : http://www.bmi.bund.de/shareddocs/downloads/de/themen/politik_gesellschaft/expertenkreis_antisemmitismus/bericht.pdf?__blob=publicationfile, 
  did you only read the article or have you tried to read the study itself ? 
  tell the queen her ancestors should n't have conquered so much of the world :p, 
  britain ? 
  ireland ? 
  ah so that 's the post to create scandals to the media can report about them ? 
  i doubt that those 25 % will move out of scotland . 
  why do you want the irish one ? 
  is n't the uk one `` better '' in terms of traveling w/o a visa ? 
  wikipedia says it 's just 12 years 20 years could produce the interesting situation wherein an unmarried couple ( swiss mother ) gets a baby and the child could vote 2 years before the father can .
