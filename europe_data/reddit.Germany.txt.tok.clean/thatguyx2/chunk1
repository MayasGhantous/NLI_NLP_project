  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/icon#catholic_church_view  the roman catholic church accepted the decrees of the iconodule seventh ecumenical council regarding images . 
  there is some minor difference , however , in the catholic attitude to images from that of the orthodox . 
  following gregory the great , catholics emphasize the role of images as the biblia pauperum , the `` bible of the poor , '' from which those who could not read could nonetheless learn . 
   catholics also , however , accept in principle the eastern orthodox veneration of images , believing that whenever approached , sacred images are to be reverenced . 
  though using both flat wooden panel and stretched canvas paintings , catholics traditionally have also favored images in the form of three-dimensional statuary , whereas in the east , statuary is much less widely employed . 
  the point is that many underaged boys were abused , and since it was the most common form of same-sex relationships between males in greece , this information should point out that ancient greece is not a good model for the view on homosexuality today . 
  people just write homosexuality in ancient greece but do n't mention this depressing fact . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homosexuality_in_ancient_greece#pederasty  the most common form of same-sex relationships between males in greece was `` paiderastia '' ( pederastry ) meaning `` boy love '' . 
  it was a relationship between an older male and an adolescent youth . 
  a boy was considered a `` boy '' until he was able to grow a full beard . 
  in athens the older man was called erastes , he was to educate , protect , love , and provide a role model for his eromenos , whose reward for him lay in his beauty , youth , and promise .

  eastern european folk music is influenced by church music and vice versa . 
  the church influence comes from musical notation that was not present in old folk traditions . 
  another influence comes from the institutionalization of musical tradition . 
  while gregorian chant is present in the west church ( roman catholic ) , folk music of orthodox countries have more similarities to orthodox byzantine notation tradition . 
  here 's a classical example [ gregorian chant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlr90nldp-0 ) example of an [ orthodox chant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcgqxnpuk6c ) the main similarity in style between catholic and orthodox chants and slavic folklore is that they are often polyphonic . 
  the music styles from the churches were brought into folklore trough notation traditions .
