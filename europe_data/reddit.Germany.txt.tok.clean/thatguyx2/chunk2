  portuguese names sound to me always like football players . 
   i hope ~ ~ g\u0336e\u0336r\u0336m\u0336a\u0336n\u0336y\u0336 \u0336e\u0336u\u0336r\u0336o\u0336p\u0336e\u0336 western europe & parts of northern and southern europe ~ ~ the civilized world can snap out of it , before more terror attacks force them to . 
  hold my rakija : tesla was pure serbian beethoven was pure dutch marco polo was a croat, 
   unlike europeans turks care about bosnians what the hell are you talking about ? 
  austria for example was one of the main investors for rebuilding houses trough donations . 
   turkey should have stopped it . 
  what kind of help are you talking about ? 
   unfortunately we had weak government . 
  how do you see your current government ? 
  turks `` invading '' cyprus because turkish cypriots are massacred is a bad analogy to turks invading bosnia for bosniaks being massacred . 
  you mean fryderyk franciszek chopin / s i know , i was just kidding . 
  i prefer polish melodies https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qeuvoibhk, 
  since abnormality is a statistical deviation from the norm , it would not be a surprise that those who are on the top of a social hierarchy have extreme high scores of relevant psychological traits . 
  bosnian muslims are not turks . 
  [ there 's still hope ] ( https://i.imgur.com/lnterfj.jpg ), 
  you often see comments joking about germany invading poland . 
  they should read [ this diary ] ( http://www.warsawuprising.com/witness/schenk.htm ) . 
  here are examples :  they were speeding up a polish woman in a long coat . 
  she was holding a little girl in her arms . 
  people crowded on the tank were helping her to climb up . 
  someone took the girl . 
  when he was handing her back to the mother the tank started moving forward . 
  the child fell down under the tracks and got crushed . 
  the woman was screaming in terror . 
  one of the ss-men frowned and shot the woman in the head . 
  they continued driving . 
  those who tried to escape were killed by ss-men . '', 
   `` or that polish woman '' ( schenk does n't remember which action it was ) . 
  `` every time , when we stormed the cellars and women were inside the dirlewanger soldiers raped them . 
  many times a group raped the same woman , quickly , still holding weapons in their hands . 
  then after one of the fights , i was standing shaking by the wall and could n't calm my nerves . 
  dirlewanger soldiers burst in . 
  one of them took a woman . 
  she was pretty . 
  she was n't screaming . 
  then he was raping her , pushing her head strongly against the table , holding a bayonet in the other hand . 
  first he cut open her blouse . 
  then one cut from stomach to throat . 
  blood gushed . 
  do you know , how fast blood congeals in august ? '', 
  i know it is just a joke and i ca n't blame people , but at least it should be known what horrifying suffering it brought over the people who were seen as subhumans by the nazis . 
   i suppose ~ ~ ghandi ~ ~ ** gandhi ** achieved freedom for india by killing all the englishmen then . 
  fucking pop history with its symbolic figures . 
  the context , purpose and way of protest was different in india . 
  not every peaceful protest is like gandhi 's . 
  humanity on the eastern front by nazis :  `` after the door of the building was blown off we saw a daycare-full of small children , around 500 ; all with small hands in the air . 
  even dirlewanger 's own people called him a butcher ; he ordered to kill them all . 
  the shots were fired , but he requested his men to save the ammo and finish them off by rifle-butts and bayonets . 
  blood and brain matter flowed in streams down the stairs . '', 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/36th_waffen_grenadier_division_of_the_ss on the topic of eastern front i can recommend the movie [ come and see ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091251/ ) . 
  it is considered as one of the darkest and most realistic war movies ever made . 
  what i like about it , it does n't glorify anyone . 
  you should be able to find it on youtube . 
  here 's an analasys of it : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqkdg5ppzsg, 
  this is one of the scariest videos i have ever seen . 
  the footage is mostly from wwi trench wars and the consequences . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4pd527gn48 ( nsfw ), 
  to bad i only understand serbian and a few words of bosnian . 
  i wish there were subtitles . 
  / s i hope there will be soon again a sense of such unity . 
  thanks for the link btw . 
  tv kalendar is maybe the best thing hrt has ever produced . 
  you are anytime welcome on the balkan , even with your flag and hussar uniform . 
  sorry , in my head it sounded like `` and he 's even a hero in croatia '', 
  why would he not be a hero if he lead an uprising against forced magyarization ? 
  the potential today is so big that it would be called megalomania if someone would use it in full force . 
  we get it , you dive, 
  you say that now because you still do n't suffer from your government . 
  any alternative is great to humiliation . 
  lol , i know a few who define themselves as germans , not slavs . 
   they also looted and ransacked many villas that belonged to wealthier people . 
  i would n't mind at all if it happened today in balkan countries , because it is a perversion to drive your brand new bmw next to half broken houses roads . 
  do n't understand me wrong , i have nothing against hard and honest work , but most rich people today profited during the war and exploit their workers . 
  i hope a mob of people who had enough and who are driven by desperation forms one day . 
  the people are definitely there , we saw it in bosnia a few years ago , but a collective movement is not there yet . 
  a short documentary about the turbo folk scene in belgrade https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k15lkh4l6sk, 
  arhim . 
  nikodimos kabarnos has also a great voice https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6y31x9ijuo, 
  that comment section is hilarious . 
   this is ethereal and utterly beautiful . 
  you should check out this chant from georgia in aramaic language https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d-nc0n9jt8, 
  then your state should not give any fucking money . 
  i hope they reach their demands in this case . 
  would you say they represent the 80 million people of turkey . 
  no flags piggybacking protests in turkey ? 
  what detail ruins this speech ? 
  any snapshots , any jokes about his hair or intelligence ? 
  i wonder what language they spoke . 
  the dutch are responsible for the massacre . 
  no , armenia and georgia are the only states in the caucasus where the majority of people are orthodox christians . 
  the state azerbaijan and russian region chechnya are predominantly muslim . 
  `` let 's make my my joke funny by defending it in the comments . '', 
  this one is about the eu not about europe . 
  there should be a caricature that says `` greeks will not shot you '' . 
  hands down , belgium was one of the worst colonial powers . 
  the visegrad group is evolving into a 12 nation initiative https://visegradpost.com/en/2016/08/28/the-three-seas-initiative-central-and-eastern-europe-takes-charge-of-its-own-destiny/  the three seas initiative has 12 member countries along a north-south axis from the baltic sea to the adriatic sea and the black sea : austria , bulgaria , croatia , czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , romania , slovakia and slovenia . 
  all , except neutral austria , are ex-communist countries .

  in what did you invest 40h in the past week that you can show off ? 
  what 's the thing with those symbolic performances ?
