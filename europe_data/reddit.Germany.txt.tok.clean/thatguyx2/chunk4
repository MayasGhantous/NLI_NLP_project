  it 's mostly uncircumcised males who are against circumcision . 
  just think about it , if circumcised males ( who are usually heads of their families ) would feel mutilated then they would not have done it to their sons and the circle would have been stopped by now . 
  the whole thing is a political campaign to restrict religious practices trough legal the legal system . 
  damn , i live on the balkans and even here i do n't see any military patrols . 
  maybe in kosovo but that 's it . 
  do you think they will soon not be necessary ? 
   must have been driving a volkswagen explains the smog . 
  do you have now military patrolling in your cities ? 
  it will happen as long the money flows . 
  i just think that uk is not that disorganized as it is shown in the comic . 
  they are playing a diplomatic game , which is normal , since every nation wants the best deal . 
  since his heels are not showing i assume he 's a western spy . 
  the strong confident eu that makes a deal with the politician who wants to leave the union because he has no idea what he 's doing . 
  that 's totally the reality and there 's nothing wrong on the eu side . 
  i 'd usually argument about georgia and armenia now , but since you are an ukrainian i ca n't blame you for bashing russia .

  let the man rest in peace and stop using his corpse for such political agendas . 
  nazi shit should never be mentioned , except for the horrors it brought over the world . 
  cool pic but i am personally not a big fan of staged political images . 
  any close contact between two guys is seen as sexual nowdays ? 
  i know the badge says homo , but do you think they are now homosexuals because of this ? 
  sorry to break it to you , but nobody outside of reddit gives a shit about the opinions and memes here , especially nobody cares about / r/europe . 
  what do you mean by serbia 's [ dragostea ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9ybicd43mc ) ? 
  it was probably only [ dies irae ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlr90nldp-0 ), 
  i am not for the current mafia regime , but i am at the same time worried that russia might fall one day into the opposite and become what it was under yeltsin , an american puppet state . 
  hope that country will have a soft change , from oligarch mafia state to what the people really desire . 
  honest question , is there a politician in russia that is not corrupt ? 
  to understand balkan politics you hae to live here for a few years . 
  first thing you will learn is that labels make sometimes no sense . 
  bosnia had also its first grassroots movement that was formed during the big protests a few years ago . 
  it never really became politically active and was absorbed by the usual big corrupt parties . 
  in serbia and croatia such movements can have a bigger success because those countries are in a much less degree fragmented than bosnia . 
  south-slav and not greek here . 
  what have modern macedonians in common with greeks ? 
  most of them are slavs or albanians and have no direct historical connection to hellenic history besides ** a part ** of ancient macedonia being in the same region . 
  the whole obsession with ancient greece is cringy and should stop . 
  macedonia has its own culture , especially in form of great music . 
  why not be more authentic orientated instead of becoming a meme . 
  is the city something for snobs like me who prefer functionality over useless decoration ? 
  what has russia to do with this ? 
  i 'd welcome any day 10 million ukrainians for permanent residency in the eu over people who do n't want to give up a part of their culture for integration , i. e. from turkey and arab countries . 
  i thought the point of mods is to reduce my mouse distance . 
  you mean `` i 'll sue your ass ! '', 
  [ devshirme ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/devshirme ) is still in balkan collective memory . 
  a reason why muslims are disliked over here . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pan-slavic_colors you are right about the dutch flag , since the slavic flag is related to it . 
  in 2000 years future civilizations discover the buildings under the sea and claim greece was the peak of civilization in 2017 . 
  so ugly , i love it . 
  because they do n't go on vacation . 
  compare the romans with the more `` advanced '' ottomans , who built donkey paths . 
  split and pula are still impressive . 
  real words actually in croatian : brz = fast ( for masculine gender ) vrh = peak mrk = dark ( for masculine gender ), 
   not because bulgaria is going to attack serbia . 
   excommunication sucks dude . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrt2ckvjlle edit : if anyone is interested in the chant . 
  it 's called dies irae : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlr90nldp-0, 
  i do n't hate them , because i understand that they put everything on one card to escape misery and go to live somewhere where all those people in movies and other popular media are successful . 
  poverty is horrible , not only on the level of basic human needs but also psychologically . 
  if those economic migrants have nothing to lose , since they already live in a shithole , why would they care if the people where they are heading to will hate them ? 
  the problem is , letting everyone into europe is not the solution . 
  maybe it is for a small number , but when you let in one million economic migrants , then you can ask why are the other billon not allowed the same privilege ? 
  the only solution is to help in the poor countries . 
  the first step should not be to pump money into corrupt political and social structures , but to forbid our own governments to exploit some of those countries , i. e. not buying diamonds and valuable metals from labor slave farms , not allowing monopolizing the water in poor countries etc. 
  i am not one of those naive people who blame ( modern ) colonialism for all the misery in the world . 
  it is about reducing our own part of fault . 
  after our part deals should be made with reasonable conditions that reduce the risk o corruption , that is for example : investments into infrastructure as long it is under eu control , investments into education with the help of our specialists , reducing the price of food and water trough subventions but in return the migration should be made harder etc. 
  only help in the epicenters of crisis makes sense . 
   let the shitstorm comments ... 
  begin !, 
  which is actually horrible . 
  people will argue , like in similar threads , to relativize systematic mass murders . 
  such events are for us only historical abstract concepts and we ca n't imagine the fear and suffering of the victims . 
  whatever someone argues , nothing changes for the victims of fanaticism . 
  thanks , i will check it out . 
  can you find another official source or copy paste the title of the study so i can find it on google scholar . 
  it 's not that i do n't believe you but i do n't know this website and do n't want my pc to get a virus or something . 
  you are right , the unemployment rate is low because of refugees . 
  the creators did an ama on / r/europe last year and answered the question about the similarity to samurai jack   the animation style to me kinda looks like samurai jack . 
  was that the style you were looking for ? 
   dimitar : well , kind of , yes . 
   our style is inspired by the great illustrator and artist eyvind earle . 
  his work has had a tremendous influence over animation - and samurai jack was also heavily influenced by him . 
  however , what we aim to do is mix the more familiar eyvind earle style with some very new and exotic elements - like eastern european and balkan architecture , costumes and typical ornamentation . 
  the more our characters venture into this magical world , the more relevant these elements will become .

  some more details about the story : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjfhl8bd2im the folkloric music is also great : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epkmdwq7cuk, 
   the tricolour flag of russia was itself inspired by the flag of the netherlands . 
  now we know who really pulls the strings behind the eastern curtains . 
  here 's a bit about the colors :  the flag combines the colours of the flags of the kingdom of croatia ( red and white ) , the kingdom of slavonia ( white and blue ) and the kingdom of dalmatia ( red and blue ) . 
  those three kingdoms are the historic constituent states of the croatian kingdom . 
   the red-white-blue tricolour has been used as the croatian flag since 1848 , and the [ pan-slavic colours ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pan-slavic_colors ) are widely associated with romantic nationalism . 
  while the banovina of croatia existed within the kingdom of yugoslavia , it had a similar flag without the modern crown above the chequy . 
  during the independent state of croatia , the flag was like the modern , but without crown and there was letter `` u '' at the top left of the flag . 
  also , the first field of croatian chequy was white . 
  while croatia was part of sfr yugoslavia its tricolour was the same , but it had a five-pointed red star with a yellow border in place of the coat of arms . 
  the star was replaced by the coat in may 1990 , shortly after the first multiparty elections . 
  the current flag and the coat of arms were officially adopted on 21 december 1990 , about ten months before the proclamation of independence from yugoslavia and a day before the constitution of croatia on 22 december 1990 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_croatia#history, 
  and today the life expectancy of macedonians is 73.5 years . 
  only +13 years in over 2000 years of history . 
  crazy , huh ?
