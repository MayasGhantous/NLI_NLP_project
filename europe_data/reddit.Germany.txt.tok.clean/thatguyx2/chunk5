  how is this relevant at all ? 
  you seem like your political views are formed by reddit . 
  most of these politician `` reaction images '' that get posted here regularly are only a glimpse of a moment caught with the camera . 
  do people really believe it represents anything ? 
  some more : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaax58vccak https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fevzul1d-zk ( no translation needed ), 
  yes , why ? 
  the topic is the corrupt of the church . 
  some think apparently that the church claims that all associated with it are good people . 
  i do n't think they ** all ** are ** full ** of hate . 
  priests are also human , and therefore there are good ones and bad ones . 
  being a priest does n't make being without sin . 
  [ 2 corinthians 11:13 -15 ]  for such men are false apostles , deceitful workmen , disguising themselves as apostles of christ . 
  and no wonder , for even satan disguises himself as an angel of light . 
  so it is no surprise if his servants , also , disguise themselves as servants of righteousness . 
  their end will correspond to their deeds . 
  [ 2 peter 2:1 -3 ]  but false prophets also arose among the people , just as there will be false teachers among you , who will secretly bring in destructive heresies , even denying the master who bought them , bringing upon themselves swift destruction . 
  and many will follow their sensuality , and because of them the way of truth will be blasphemed . 
  and in their greed they will exploit you with false words . 
  their condemnation from long ago is not idle , and their destruction is not asleep . 
  there are those who follow the teachings of their religion , but just because you do n't know about them from media it does n't mean they do n't exist . 
  what makes you think those in the video are full of hate ? 
  well , the title would be homophobephobic . 
  on the other side , georgia 's orthodox church has probably the most beautiful [ church music ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d-nc0n9jt8 ) ( chant in aramaic ) . 
  the beauty and fanaticism seems like a paradox . 
  maybe because he 's french , writing in english . 
  or you could just learn both scripts . 
  i 've learned cyrillic in about 3 hours while procrastinating in between . 
  there 's also linux . 
  thanks mr. torvalds/finland,

   young people  do it !, 
  also , do n't forget to think for yourself and buy into the empty `` young people '' phrase . 
  hungary is part of the eu , sa not . 
  do you personally think there should be a military intervention against orban since he seems to be a dictator ? 
  where do you have this information from ? 
  is it from your own experience or are you repeating what you read in media of your choice ? 
  let 's say he 's authoritarian , that 's a very broad term . 
  i ca n't say he is n't since i do n't experience his rule first hand . 
  if he is a dictator , should n't nato , eu or some other organization intervene and help the hungarians ? 
  the thing is , they have the right to protest and should do it if they feel like it . 
  if after the next elections orban wins they should also accept the democratic choice of the other people who live in their country . 
  they can go on with protesting against him or his decisions but in contrast with democratic decisions it makes them look like they think they are the enlightened ones and the rest of the population is made out of brainwashed zombies . 
   so , it should worry you a lot that the amount of protests have gone up . 
  it means a lot of politicians are fucking shit up . 
  many countries in the eu , including hungary had in their history never such a high living standard ( even if it 's lower compared to some other countries ) and have rights to protest and voice their opinion without the military threatening then ( which was always the case in the past ) . 
  i think those people are only looking to be part of a movement to give their live a higher meaning . 
  why is he against the ngos ? 
  so you say most of the population is brainwashed by the media ? 
  does n't the eu have a law against a president controlling all the media of his country ? 
  great sign for a facebook profile picture . 
  that 's all about , right ? 
  protests seem to have become a hobby . 
  why do n't they just vote him out of the office in the next election ? 
  it would make much more sense to go the normal way instead of constantly whining . 
  if they do n't get the majority then they should accept it since they live in a democracy . 
  of course it 's their right to protest but so more often they happen so less people take it serious . 
  sadly, 
   this kind of idiotic western attitude is fuelling anti-gay sentiment in traditional countries . 
  i agree . 
  they fail to realize that their own society is not the mirror of all other societies . 
  sometimes it looks like they think what they do is for a good cause and those methods should be used everywhere because it is ultimate good . 
  cultural colonialism at its best . 
  it 's like they think `` the eastern european savages do n't know they need our civilization '' . 
  great , thanks . 
   if you want to watch a guy make up bullshit stories on the go without batting an eye like that buddhists praise the devil now i really want to watch him . 
  thanks for your answer . 
  why do n't you feel represented by it ? 
  serious question , do all gay people feel represented by such gay pride campaigns ? 
  i mean , are there those who do n't like it ? 
  give it some time . 
  a controlled leave might be better than being a part of the eu while it gets hit by a major financial crisis . 
  you know that greece is still the `` achilles ' heel '' of the eu . 
   europhiles/eu employees there might be a correlation . 
  some political ideologies would argue that this is the case . 
  from how much poland suffered in the war ( like many other nations ) , he has all the right to mention it whenever he wants .

  i knew janusz korwin mikke could n't be that bad . 
  can i find it on youtube ? 
  do n't forget to save them only on your current hd . 
  did n't all these connections come from shared historical struggles ? 
  i think the eu has also that potential if it stays relevant and can connect people in future crisis times , but it takes a lot of time . 
  bureaucracy and protests alone ca n't reach that . 
  my feeling is , when i look at the past five years , that some nations drifted apart , which is sad because the eu is a big chance for us all . 
  it 's the eu that needs to find answers , blaming single nations is contra productive and makes the people only more opposed to it . 
  i do n't oppose the eu . 
  for me it 's just too distanced and abstract to feel emotionally connected . 
  it is more like a corporation in organizational terms . 
  being emotionally involved is for me like loving a product brand . 
  i support the eu as long it does n't threatens my culture . 
   so is usa and they seem to be plenty patriotic . 
  you do n't have to have a completely uniform population in order for them to share common values . 
  true , but usa is a special case . 
  take the afro-american population for example . 
  their roots were violently cut off by slavery for generations . 
  the situation would probably look different if each of them knew their roots . 
  since humans look for a collective identity they took the one of the north , the america that freed the slaves during the civil war . 
  it was their only choice .
