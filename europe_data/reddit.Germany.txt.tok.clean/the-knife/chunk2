  maybe ** you ** ca n't figure out wine and cheese . 
  we 're doing just fine . 
  how is that a good thing ? 
  nobody is allowed to legally use force against other people , other than the police . 
  just because you sympathize with the leftist mob does n't make it `` good '' . 
  or no mass extinction events like big wars , famines , epidemics etc. 
  surely the usa can not be blamed for every war and conflict that people are fleeing from . 
  they also can not be blamed for the culture and the people that made those countries what they are today . 
  that is a dumb political talking point . 
  yes , opinions contrary to yours should be deleted immediately . 
  hmm , okay . 
  sorry for posting this in an unrelated thread , i guess that is why i got 4 downvotes in three minutes , ha . 
  what happened to the stickied immigration megathread ? 
  why is there not one post on the frontpage with `` asylum '' or `` immigration '' or `` refugees '' ? 
  hey shill , you sound like a broken record . 
  official safe channels in africa , which would have to deny 99 % of all applicants . 
  those people would n't just be like `` oh , okay '' and go home . 
  sure , there 's a leftist twist to the truth on just about anything . 
  your socialist agenda is blinding you to the facts , one of its facets is our unparalleled wealth and economic independence , unlike anything we have ever had in germany . 
  enjoy voting die linke !, 
  domestic policies have little to do with trade surpluses . 
  why would you even think that ? 
  we had to reform our labor market , and we were damn successful with these `` austere '' measures . 
  employment is at an all-time high . 
  we export so many goods because they have the best quality money can buy in the world . 
  cars , machines , chemistry , high-tech ... our wealth is not founded on the backs of the greeks , but on our own hard work and ingenuity . 
  wow , whining and begging for solidarity for months , then when you get the billions stuffed up your ass , you whine about `` degradation '' !, 
  losing national sovereignity in regards to policies like immigration , refugees , labor restrictions can lead to unwanted measures , dictated by technocrats and politicians of other nations , which are not supported by the majority of your own people . 
  no european country wants refugee quotas , for example . 
  centralized power structures can just enforce this ambition . 
  denmark just recently sent a clear message that it does not want to be controlled from outside , and that it wants to set its own rules regarding immigration , i think this is what / u/silmariel is getting at . 
  but 25 % body fat ? 
  surely not . 
  those numbers seem very unrealistic . 
  you must have had no muscles at all . 
  nobody agrees with you . 
  you must be like , super fat . 
  greeks do n't give a fuck at all , do they ? 
  so germans fighting for the `` wrong '' side are disgusting and shameful , but germans fighting for the `` right '' side are good and strong heroes !, 
  it is true , history is written by the victors . 
  soldiers are soldiers , regardless of their cause . 
   always nonsense malnutrition can lead to slower population growth ( infant death ) . 
  scarce ressources can lead to war . 
   certain death in their war-torn country what war are you talking about ? 
  `` certain death '' ? 
  where ? 
  these people might be poor , but they 're not exactly being hunted for sport . 
  if you increase measures to patrol the sea and rescue every boat , you will increase the amount of illegal immigration , it 's actually a very simple correlation . 
  it would be damn effective at stopping this kind of immigration , however evil it is . 
  besides , they do n't have the infrastructure to support this kind of growth . 
  who should feed all these people ? 
  these desperate measures are called `` austerity '' , not making radical threats and acting like utter fools on the international stage . 
  if they actually try to make good on their threat , it should be a no-brainer for the eu to exclude greece from the schengen treaty . 
  poor isolated immigrants , how come we do n't give them jobs , houses and free money ? 
  how intolerant of us !, 
  it 's nice to hear a romanian say that about my grandparents ' people . 
  my grandpa grew up in hermannstadt , my grandmother in klausenburg , they left their home during and after the war . 
  people like this are why we are in this mess . 
  bj\u00f6rn h\u00f6cke is not the party leader . 
  that would be frauke petry . 
  your comment is not about economics , it 's a political talking point . 
  small businesses by refugees will save germany 's export oriented economy ? 
  what a dumb comment . 
  that 's where you got your downvotes . 
  quit trying to paint yourself as the poor victim here . 
  your leftist ideas are not popular anymore , people are looking past the socialist bullshit and demographical engineering . 
  if you flat out deny that the zeit blogs are leftist , you once again prove you have no grip on reality . 
  even the newspaper they publish is hardly ever politically neutral . 
  i think the influence of 3 $ - d\u00f6ner consumption , some ten-thousand euro start-ups , compared to the ** billions of euros ** exports in all kinds of high-tech sectors is ** negligible ** , to put it mildly . 
  you 'd have to be pretty fucking optimistic , even naive , to think that refugees will help the german economy , one of the most developed and skill-based in the world . 
  we need skilled immigration from developed countries , not an uncontrolled mass exodus of muslim immigrants , that could maybe help in an industrial , labor-intensive economy . 
  that blog article to that leftist site you linked is based on the most hilarious naive assumptions . 
  every refugee , man , woman and child , will have a full paying job after 2 years ? 
  and keep paying taxes for 38 years ? 
  are you fucking kidding me . 
  if you believe those phantasies , you have truly lost grip on reality . 
   a caf\u00e8 , a restaurant or other easy-entry level businesses will pop-up . 
  therefore germany will get a bit less dependent on exports . 
  what ? 
  how will more tea shops and d\u00f6ner places help us get less dependent on exports ? 
  please elaborate how those things are connected . 
   but this self perception that germans did n't even realise they had has also been shattered due to the wv scandal on the emissions test . 
  this is what some media want to make us believe . 
  looking at the stock prices , talking to friends and colleagues , you get the impression that the `` scandal '' was blown way out of proportion . 
  the values and successes of german industry are not dead due to one company 's digressions . 
  immigrants are not the problem per se , islam and stone-age culture is . 
  do n't be dissuaded from opposing islamic immigration . 
  no tolerance of intolerance !, 
  use mixed housing to identify extremist elements , and remove them from the asylum application process . 
  two birds , one stone . 
  conveniently , no refugees reached munich 's inner city because direct train connections from salzburg were scratched all-together , and border controls were instated . 
  during oktoberfest and up until today , the refugees come through passau , freilassing , and the green borders in between . 
  they were then loaded into special trains and distributed to their camps . 
  we do n't know what would have happened if the thousands of refugees had mingled with the drunken masses , it just did n't happen because they were diverted . 
  ok , stay in your happy peaceful liberal bubble , that 's fine . 
  but for god 's sake , use the apostrophe ' , not \u00b4 . 
  you are literally the minority , when no one you talk to is worried . 
  check the latest allensbach poll . 
  right . 
  nothing will ever change for the ethnic working class in germany .
