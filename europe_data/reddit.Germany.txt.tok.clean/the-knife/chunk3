  struggle for jobs , for living space , all polemical fearmongering !, 
  / s downplaying or ignoring these huge problems is what makes people distrust the media and politicians , attesting them a lack of sense for reality . 
  yes , it will be a gradual change . 
  it only takes a few generations of differing birth rates . 
  have you ever even been to switzerland , actually talked to those `` smug and narcissistic '' people ? 
  blinded by the very same ideology that got us into this situation . 
  nobody ever asked for consent . 
  if only it were european ... islam has nothing to do with our values and culture . 
  he might not have started it , i.e. 
  built the first one , but he initiated a huge public works program to expand it . 
  there 's even a mildly successful tv format about this , called [ `` the world 's strictest parents '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_world%27s_strictest_parents ) in the uk , or `` die strengsten eltern der welt '' in germany . 
  they do n't cost billions in social welfare , they do n't destroy cultural cohesion ( since there is n't any to begin with ) and they do underpaid shit labor , which is not possible due to minimum wage laws in europe . 
  i think refugees are worse for europe than illegal mexicans for the us . 
  i do n't think she personally expected them , she just lied and promised them , to appease the critics . 
  i drive my bmw 316 touring at 5.2 l/100km on average . 
  it is extremely efficient . 
  factory says 4.5 , so i ca n't complain too much . 
  it 's only 15 % over . 
  our culture has changed , has n't it ? 
  theirs has n't , in regards to a lot of values we westerners take for granted . 
  i actually like the discussion culture on / r/europe . 
  it definitely is n't the echo chamber some believe , i think there is a great diversity of opinion and lively discussions . 
  this `` my totally reasonable , well-put and researched opinion gets instantly downvoted to oblivion ! '', 
  trope is not even based in reality , it just screams persecution complex . 
  if people formulate their comment in a valid , reasonable , non-trollish way , they do not get downvoted . 
  case in point , look at all these upvoted comments in this thread , circlejerking how persecuted they are , while collecting upvotes left and right . 
  it does n't add up . 
  fair enough . 
  then why are you calling them immigrants ? 
  by all means , integrate , educate them , bring them into the workforce . 
  that worked so well in that past !, 
  we could expedite this by cutting off their total reliance on welfare . 
  anyway , this legislation changes nothing about the stigmatization . 
  an imbalanced , special treatment will only make the tax-paying population more upset , if it goes towards sustenance , and not betterment . 
  you and i both know that the recent roma immigration waves come from the former eastern block , to which we have opened our borders , our economy and more importantly our welfare state . 
  anyone who sees the immigration of unskilled human masses as a ** positive ** development needs to be honest about their agenda . 
   radical cdu voter i chuckled . 
  the idea that handing out welfare checks to people that do n't belong here in the first place , who do not contribute to the welfare of the society , could somehow result in a ** net gain ** because * supermarkets * earn more is plain ridiculous . 
  you do n't congratulate the lion that tears off your limb for increasing meat consumption . 
  you 'd rather the lion stay in the fucking savanna . 
   many are poorly educated and live off state welfare . 
  well , ai n't that a surprise . 
  so what are we protecting them from ? 
  claiming personal responsibility for their livelihood ? 
  oh a nazi joke , how inspired . 
  persecution complex ? 
  look at op 's post . 
  this is a non-argument . 
  as long as the people causing the problems identify with islam instead of a civil society , there can not be any progress . 
  you ca n't change the people without having them forsake their religion . 
   ** anyone who disagrees with me is a racist fascist !, 
  how does * having talked to random people * change facts , statistics , cultural impact , an objective assessment of immigration ? 
  ban free speech and kill all dissenters , obviously . 
  it 's the socialist way . 
  i am actually kind of glad about the shift . 
  people have always had these opinions , it 's about time they got more pronounced and less taboo . 
  discrediting and shaming differing opinions as `` racist '' and `` fascist '' is just so typical of a leftist douchebags like op here . 
  fuck off , we have a voice now . 
  multiculturalism has failed , and it 's time for real europeans to stand up for their rights and interests . 
  only then will you be human !, 
  they can be unemployed all they want , as long as it 's not at the expense of the rest of europe . 
  the thing about immigrant crime is that it * could have been prevented * by not allowing working class immigration . 
  because it is . 
   because taking the law into own hands and burning shit to the ground that 's not defending , e.g. 
  not what i meant  is so much better than the immigrants what ? 
  how can an activity be better than an object ? 
   and the roma are the cause of all this huh ? 
  by `` all this '' i assume you mean `` panhandling , social and educational neglect , petty and violent crime '' , and yes , those problems are systemic in roma populations . 
  you 're the only one mentioning germans in this thread . 
  what 's better , being xenophobic and willing to defend , or being a helpless witness to and victim of panhandling , social and educational neglect , petty and violent crime ? 
  france is n't one single entity . 
  the french government condemned the attacks , some french village people burned down a camp . 
  not hypocrisy if it is n't the same person . 
  never gon na happen . 
  unless people collectively lose their mind and put actual communists in power . 
  * next !, 
   doing the world an unintentional good indeed , by making everyone reaffirm their low opinion of islam and muslims . 
  fucking jihadists , living on our welfare . 
  schulz did a fantastic job at explaining the european position , but then again , it 's his whole entire job to be informed and knowledgable about it . 
  he is a journalist asking contrarian questions , i do n't see a problem with this . 
  i dislike puff-piece interviews , this was n't one of those . 
  no , not really . 
  the current government 's stance is one of continued national autonomy . 
  a proposed fiscal union is not a eu government . 
  oh okay , you just do n't know what the hell you 're talking about . 
  all 83 million of them ? 
  you need to be more precise . 
  eu government ? 
  who ever proposed that ? 
  are you mad ? 
  and you get a crate of these for 6,90 $ ? 
  sorry for being so hard on you on this one . 
  just want you to admit that beer is more expensive . 
  found some interesting stuff [ here ] ( http://www.braulotse.de/startseite/bier/biersorten/bierpreise.html ) . 
  name one . 
  oettinger is n't beer . 
  we should do business . 
  it 's not circa 3,50 $ , it 's exactly 3,10 $ . 
  in bulgaria ? 
  here it 's 1,50 $ for the crate plus 8 cents per bottle , 20 bottles per crate = 1,60 $ bottle deposit .
