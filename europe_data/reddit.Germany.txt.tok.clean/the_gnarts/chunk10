  though you should have included the citation in the post itself . 
  whoa , is this some kind of alternate history copy-pasta ? 
   those are paying off the mortgages ... and property in germany is not cheap at all . 
  proportionally this is n't as big an issue as in other countries as more people rent anyways since , as you mention , real estate is insanely expensive over here . 
   from the polish ( but also the czech ) perspective , nato is the cornerstone of our security , it 's the most important security guarantee we have and the us ( at least until trump got in power ) is the strongest and most reliable ally against russia . 
  nato is part of the problem though and in a global context that solo move inviting us missiles to be stationed on polish territory is just another degree of escalation of american posturing . 
  to the detriment of the position of the eu to negotiate an alternative solution . 
  in the end , it made the polish government look like the us puppets as which russia likes to seem them portrayed , and -- as you yourself admit -- with trump it turned out they were betting on the wrong horse in their overreliance on the us as the main defense partner . 
  tough luck . 
  it severely undermined the momentum as the kick in the butt that the eu countries arguably deserved to take the matter seriously , which is imo the most deplorable part about the affair . 
   a significant part of german politicians think about nato the way you think about nato . 
  the political landscape is sort of split between the atlantic bridge who prefer to intensify us-german relations , and those who opt for more self reliance . 
  the borders between the two ends of the spectrum do n't map to party borders so there 's never going to be a clear vote to be had on which direction is more popular . 
  but you 're correct , the us meddling with local affairs is overwhelmingly perceived as a threat to stability . 
   but it 's not just ns2 . 
  for example for a long time , poland has been trying to secure pernament nato bases in their country . 
  and not only germany never supported that , they were also arguing against it . 
  nato as a military pact is entirely orthogonal to the eu as the defining project of the continent . 
  the objections against e. g. the presence of us rockets and the guidance stations were definitely reasonable . 
  if it was an issue debated as part of a genuine european defense plan , the situation would likely have been different and the rest of the eu would have been more likely to find a common ground with poland and czech republic . 
  this is n't the case , obviously , and conflating the two does n't further the argument . 
   because it would be provoking russia , it would be too much of warmongering . 
  specially spd talks like this very frequently . 
  extending the decidedly anti-russian nato presence right until the russian border was bound to increase the already existing tension in eastern europe . 
  if you ask me , sacrificing stability in europe over some tangential organisation like nato -- in which eu countries , if they have any say at all , only participate unilaterally -- was not justified . 
  irrespective of how much of a military threat russia in fact is , nato is n't the proper forum for giving shape to a combined eu defense politics . 
   all i 'm saying is that if you ( german people ) keep voting for politicians who push for projects like nord stream 2 , then you 're not likely to have the most close relationship with poland regardless of who is in power in poland . 
  i absolutely agree . 
  the whole issue ( again ) betrayed the lack of historical sensitivity and political spine of our elected officials . 
  how germany weaseled its way around eu-russian affairs is unacceptable and the subsequent escalation of bilateral tensions was entirely predictable . 
  the cynical silence of the other eu players , mainly france and the uk was surprising too . 
  in some ways it did resemble the constellation of the mid 30s . 
   there are two sides to that relationship , with germany being one of the sides . 
  your government is just as much responsible for the bilateral relations as poland is and some of the steps taken by the german governments have not been very polish-friendly too . 
  there 's no denying that , but i was less concerned with the immediate bilateral relations than with the commitment to the eu as the common political framework for them . 
   so perhaps if you 'd like better polish-german relations , firstly think about who you vote for instead of who polish people vote for . 
  disregarding the presumptuousness of you divining my voting preferences , i do n't think this was ever a direct choice of the german electorate even if they were actually interested in it . 
  granted , i 'm not the most political person , but from my limited grasp on the exterior politics of the parties that have or have had a realistic chance of participating in a government , none of them would have promised a change in direction wrt . 
  our relation to poland . 
  as in , corporations [ habitually greasing their way through to lucrative contracts all over the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siemens#controversies ) , yes indeed . 
  there 's always the `` skilled immigration '' loophole ... 
  from many conversations with exile poles in germany and czech republic , i kind of understand the sentiment . 
  in any case , germany will welcome you if you are capable ( certified , if possible ) to perform manual labour for a little less than market price and can accept not to live in the most hip regions or cities . 
  indeed , polish immigrants are among the best kinds and have been valued here [ since the 19th century ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ruhrpolen ) . 
  on the other hand , it 's sad to witness our neighbor 's country being progressively emptied of its more open minded population . 
  continued brain and culture drain will only worsen the situation in the country in the foreseeable future . 
  i 'd love to see our relations improve to the level of commitment to cooperation that french-german relations are on now . 
  that will be even harder to achieve if all you less stubborn folks keep fleeing the country like in the past decades . 
  the more expensive `` bio '' chains often do , but often they 're sold out early . 
  learned this the hard way by scouring supermarkets for yogurt raw material . 
   cheese is fine since the lactose gets broken during the process not necessarily , since technically cheese requires only coagulation of casein by means of rennet . 
  lacto-fermentation , the process that breaks down dairy lactase using bacteria , is an optional , albeit very common treatment . 
  **  so you 're claiming there is no such thing as a indigenous european ? 
  h. heidelbergensis perhaps , or h. sapiens neanderthalensis . 
  cro-magnons and other amh were definitely immigrants by all known standards .

  you know you messed up when they start using your name to mean `` traitor '' ... 
   if you would have been there you would n't say that . 
  think so ? 
  in fact i 've ** grown up there ** . 
  during the 90s i witnessed the craze when every other person bought a watch with an `` authentic '' piece of frauenkirche sandstone in it . 
  i also happen to be familiar with the works of fritz l\u00f6ffler and have the utmost respect for him and what he achieved to conserve the city 's treasures under an unfriendly and sometimes outright hostile regime . 
  i also think that the building is an improvement on dresden 's skyline . 
  however , i disagree on the matter of rebuilding the frauenkirche as an actual church . 
  it serves no purpose at all ( saxony does n't need another church , not in dresden , not anywhere else ) and should have been turned into a museum in its entirety . 
  that 's why i preferred the ruins . 
   and turned it into its main reconciliation memorial . 
  it turned into a church . 
   the gdr did n't really do the whole preservation of historical monuments thing not far from this church , the zwinger was rebuilt under the socialists . 
   basically the only thing they did was to declare it a monument and leave it as it is . 
  which was actually not that bad an idea . 
   i for one would like to see the dresden model being applied to other cities like bucharest or warsaw ... otoh due to the reconstruction , dresden lost its main anti-war memorial right in the city center . 
  not to mention that they could have chosen not to consecrate the building and use it as a museum . 
  it 's not like there 's a lot of demand for more churches in the region . 
  dutch beaches tend to be a bit repetitive .

  you know , adjectives do n't magically begin to make sense if you string them together and uppercase them at random . 
   it has always been a country of white christians and secularists who lived in a geographical place called germany , and spoke the germanic language . 
  it has n't though . 
  neither has it been one country for long , nor did the christianization happen until well into historical times , nor has the collective area always been called germany , nor were germanic languages prevalent everywhere . 
  sorry to burst your bubble , but you should really take a history class some time . 
  hate to see you missing out on so many facts .

  i 've been wondering why [ uk mps do n't get a desk ] ( https://i.imgur.com/ura2dxm.png ) . 
  do they just record every session and listen to it later or is it the job of their assistants to keep track of the relevant points of the debate ? 
   i mean obviously it was a long time coming but it 's been like 2 days since ` gay marriage might be a thing in germany ' hit the news and now suddenly it 's all over and settled .

  not efficiency . 
  the context demanded opportunism from merkel and she gave way . 
  however , as someone who 's been allowed to vote here for over a decade , this is still the weirdest thing i 've ever witnessed in this country 's politics , hands down .
