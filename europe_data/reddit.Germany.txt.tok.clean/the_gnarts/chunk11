   sarkozy saw himself as half napoleon half de gaulle which according to basic arithmetic made him a 1/4 person . 
   saturated fat * citation needed, 
   the names of uk , france , germany and russia contains `` guo '' . 
  besides this four , chinese only use `` guo '' to write the names of 4 other countries , china , usa , south korea and thailand . 
  `` guo '' means state or country . 
  czechia as well . 
   i would never place it to ireland . 
  at least it looks better than , say , fjords in africa . 
   why is the summit called sn\u011b\u017eka while snow is called sn\u00edh ? 
  is it standard process in czech ? 
  the * \u00ed * in this case is the elongated version of \u011b , the sound the old slavonic \u0463 ( * yat ' * ) evolved into . 
  polish , lacking vowel quantities , hat the more obvious variant * \u015bnieg * . 
  oh , that and the * h * \u2192 * \u017e * alternation which corresponds to * g * \u2192 * \u017c * in polish . 
   they excluded greenland from denmark as well . 
  ... however they included [ mt. 
  pico ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mount_pico ) . 
   its nice when you have to cycle to school and work everyday , no tiring hill climbs . 
  the thing i miss most from my last apartment was the 100 m elevation gain on the commute back from work every day . 
  so no , i humbly disagree , mountains are part of what makes cycling amazing . 
  in the netherlands you eat headwind all day because of the lack of mountains to shield you from it . 
  not a too pleasant experience as far as i remember it . 
   this is r/europe , nobody knows how to spell poland . 
  well it is kind of hard in many languages to differentiate between polakia and polenia . 
   i have 3 friends with a von in their name who would disagree with you . 
  the habsburgs will rise again habsburgs are the wrong country though . 
  austria [ made carrying nobility titles illegal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austrian_nobility#abolition_of_nobility_in_1919 ) after wwi . 
  germany however weaseled itself around the issue by permitting the predicates to become flexible parts of the name . 
   every single detail of her life is meticulously planned . 
  what about her death . 
  did that get canceled repeatedly ? 
  have you ever . . worked for a company ? 
  or in the public sector ? 
  your inexperience may be excusable but not the confrontational tone . 
  it 's perfectly normal for expenses to be paid as a fixed part of the regular salary especially for people who need them on a regular a basis like for travel costs . 
  the justification is exactly what i was asking about : that the additional overhead of tracking each and every bill would needlessly waste company resources . 
   now sorry but not all of the green ones come from `` poma '' , in fact most look like they come from `` pomum '' through latin vernacular though ( a. k. a. 
  `` vulgar latin '' ) which gradually lost the differentiating endings , especially the ones ending in nasal consonants . 
  * poma * is just the classical plural of * pomum * which is the form this class of words converged on . 
  so yeah , initially an educated roman of 2000 ya would have used * pomum * or rather * malum * to refer to the apple they were eating . 
  but 500 years of a living language developing later the distinctness of these forms was already being largely eroded . 
  splitters !, 
   members of parliament , local representatives and senior civil servants , instead of being given a sum of money for expenses without having to justify expenditure , will need to produce receipts to be reimbursed for what they had spent ; sounds like a lot of overhead is required to follow through with this . 
  how many people 's receipts have to be examined ? 
  how big a staff is needed to do it frequent and thorough enough for the law to be effective ? 
  how much would that cost and will it offset the loss from politicians abusing their expense allowance ? 
   h\u00f4tel de boisgelin [ link fixed ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/h%c3%b4tel_de_boisgelin_\\ ( paris \\ ) ), 
   this is n't a us problem , this is a diversity problem . 
  the more immigrants that go to europe , the more of this you will see . 
  having more or less official , albeit utterly asinine racial categories ( caucasians , african americans , hispanics , asians , all that garbage ) kind of exacerbates the problem in the us . 
  it 's important to prevent this kind of institutionalized stereotype from cementing , regardless of the actual extent of immigration . 
  impressive pics and description , but what i 'm curious about is actually how these tunnels beneath the city are drained from groundwater . 
  there has to be some active pumping taking place somewhere in the system lest they fill up to the water table . 
   how the fuck u learn that shit on high school xd . 
  by constantly making fun of ridiculous entities like `` [ schaumburg-lippe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/principality_of_schaumburg-lippe ) '' and betting on whether they 'll still be around the next year of school . 
   frankly , if you really want it , take back alsace ; just convince them to export boar meat ( they are still hoarding it all ) . 
  i think we can have a deal , m. ob\u00e9lix . 
  there 's more than enough boars in germany already . 
   it department in one of the larger companies in germany operates until 12.00 pm 12 noon on fridays . 
  is this the norm in germany ? 
  absolutely not . 
  it people usually have the shittiest working hours because they 're perceived as an interruption to the work of others . 
  it 's not unusual for people in the business to work early or late shifts work days and then weekends . 
   this is calculated by dividing the total hours worked by number of workers , and includes part-time employment . 
  so ... completely useless absolute numbers . 
  here 's a thing i * do n't * know about finland for a change : is the olkiluoto plant completed yet ? 
  how much power does switzerland import from its neighbors ? 
   i meant in the shape of the virgin mary . 
  see by yourself . 
  sorry , this clearly lacks any visual cues of the portrayed woman being a virgin . 
  besides , why even focus on a random detail like that ? 
  way to be a creep , that 's for certain . 
   virgin-shaped would n't that just be regular girl / woman shaped ? 
   bog ohrani , bog obvarji   nam cesarja , avstrijo , my brain intuitively started orchestrating my reading of these lines with `` gott erhalte franz den kaiser '' . 
  is it far off ? 
   closed stadium looks pretty open to me . 
   so if i were to eat only the equivalent of 1000 calories of white bread per day for an entire year , you 'd say that i will not only get scurvy , but also fat ? 
  unless you 're leading an extremely sedentiary life you 'll probably starve to death at only 1000 kcal / d . but you 'll probably do so with slightly higher insuline resistance than if you ate a balanced diet including other macronutrients . 
   carbs do n't make you fat . 
  disproportional intake of carbs , especially short-chained sugars ( = = higher glycemic index ) causes insulin resistance due to constantly high blood glucose . 
  which is a dead sure way to get obese and drastically increase the risk of becoming a type-2 diabetic . 
   we are taught to eat at least 2 fruits per day that 's a lot considering the macro nutrients in fruit boil down mostly to sugar . 
   everyone has to do it for himself by himself . 
  only true if there were no public health systems . 
  the damage obesity does affects not only sick individuals but society as a whole . 
  thus it 's only consequential to address it not only on a medical level but also as a matter of national economics . 
   which makes clear that the tories want to introduce huge changes to the way the internet works . 
  apart from the obvious fact that thought crime seems to enjoy a renaissance as a political scarecrow , this seems to be more concerned with the www than the internet . 
  censorship , surveillance , the same authoritarian package , as unoriginal as ever and devoid of any innovation . 
  that legend is useless . 
   instead is from `` ine stede '' , meaning `` in place '' . 
    pretend comes from latin `` prae tendo '' . 
  well yes , but etymology does n't change anything in this case . 
   - in stead  - pre tend those are prefixes . 
  as such they 're quite different from compounds which consist of two or more nouns . 
   conjugate adjectives * decline apart from that , spot on . 
   for this to work huge amount of training data is required , there 's no way around it . 
  ( at the moment ) . 
  there is enormous potential for care improvement here . 
  especially image detection tasks that require the attention of tens of thousands of trained professionals could be entirely automated and be made available to the public in the next few years . 
  then make it a public research project entirely on public funds with strict data protection guidelines and a complete isolation of private companies from any of the data .
