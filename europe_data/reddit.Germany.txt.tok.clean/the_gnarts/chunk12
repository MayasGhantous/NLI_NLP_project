  granting ibm unrestricted access to the medical records of your citizens is admitting that your country 's reseach capabilities are lacking in the first place . 
   how do people imagine scientific progress happens without sharing data ? 
  what a strawman . 
  the data is n't the problem . 
  it 's who it 's shared with . 
  it 's normal for studies on sensitive issues to not publish data and grant access only to trustworthy researchers . 
  sharing all of it indiscriminately with some overseas company in exchange for an `` investment '' does n't benefit science . 
   czech where vowel lengths disappeared quite a long time ago can you clarify that ? 
  czech even has diacritics for vowel quantities . 
   the construct is a bit more complicated , it is a credit ( studienbeitragsdarlehen ) without interest , but the amout you have to pay back is capped together with baf\u00f6g , so if you relied on baf\u00f6g you are at the cap anyways and never pay anything of the 500 $ student fees . 
  it still subtracts eur 500 from your semester 's budget which is almost a month 's worth of full baf\u00f6g support . 
  believe me , if you 're studying in a place where rents are already high , this is hard to recover from , regardless of whether you 're going to have to repay the money eventually or not . 
   70 % of those titles stopped being relevant 200 + years ago . 
  tell your monarch to just let it goooo 100 % are irrelevant today . 
  all i need to know is that i 'm going to go there next saturday . 
  in a tram . 
   it is a simple fact that america has a completely integrated , well funded market of over 300 million consumers in which tech companies can grow and expand . 
  europe has ( as of now ) nothing comparable . 
  there 's enough market in the eu for it with private customers , businesses and infrastructurally demanding public projects . 
   glofo in dresden produces amd 's chips . 
  they 're mostly x86/amd64 though . 
  not sure whether their insignificant arm line is being produced in the dresden plant . 
   we still make arm arm is just `` ip '' that does n't get `` made '' except in some metaphorical sense . 
  the actual production takes place elsewhere . 
   and this is where he lived . 
  and this is where lord langdon lived who refused to speak to us ... 
  when you visit , do n't miss the [ museum of archeology ] ( http://www.konstanz.alm-bw.de/de/ ) . 
  also just across the lake there 's the open air [ museum of stilt houses ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pfahlbaumuseum_unteruhldingen ) . 
  before you plan a trip there , check the opening hours though !, 
   47 % of spanish salaries are under 1000 $ + short time contracts + under 25 unemployment rates about 40 % . 
  i do n't get how spain failed to become the outsourcing magnet of europe . 
  should n't every company in the eu want to move big parts of their operations there ? 
  i 'm not saying i appreciate underpaying workers but it sure would redirect significant funds to the country . 
   almost 1 hour and half to reach workplace using public transport . 
  that 's insane . 
  cycle commute ( downhill in the morning ) and still think about how to truncate the boring flat section . 
  do n't you ever regret losing 3h of your life every working day ? 
   when i went to lund some years ago i had to bundle up with 4 other people just to afford rent . 
  basic did everyone have one room ? 
  in germany , sharing an apartment where everyone has their own room is probably the most common kind of student residence . 
  however , i 've experienced differently in czech republic where i once lived with two girls in three rooms ( two of them each shared one room , i had mine ) and later briefly with five girls in two rooms . 
  ( i 'm a guy and got kicked out of another apartment earlier so i moved in for two months with the girlfriend and here roomies . 
  that was fun ... ) dorm rooms are also shared there which they never are in germany . 
   i do n't think anyone here considers living in a dorm or a student apartment while you 're at uni as ` moving out ' . 
  unless you 're back home every week from friday to monday , that 's exactly what i 'd consider `` moving out '' . 
  at least in germany , most students live in shared apartments or small places of their own and if they ca n't afford the rent , they 're entitled to support from the state anyways . 
  so in most cases their parents ' contribution consists in filling out a form about their income ( as of two years ago ) every year in autumn . 
  almost all of my friends from university permanently moved out when they started studying , some even earlier if you want to count voluntary civilian service and military service which not seldom takes place 1000 km and more from the family . 
   when students move out to go to college , their place is registered as a `` temporary residence '' and their parents ' place is still listed as their `` primary residence '' so it would n't be reflected in the statistics as `` having left your parent 's place '' . 
  german towns with a potentially high ratio of secondary residents ( i. e. most university towns ) levy a fee unless you switch the primary residence there . 
  that way these people count toward this city 's population which in turn means more federal funds . 
  most affected people for who this is a significant amount ( i. e. students ) usually just ditch the secondary residence altogether since it does n't offer any real benefits . 
  that might account for some of the stats in germany . 
   i lose more time going between austria and germany ( awesome bavarian border controls with sleeping police officers , but one lane nonetheless ) than when i fly into the eu from asia . 
  is that a car thing ? 
  there were n't any controls on the train in january . 
  ** be quiet !, 
   king is literally a president who is in the office for his entire life i did n't vote for him . 
   and who has some hereditary lands and buildings the connection between the two being purely coincidental . 
   the continued existence of royalty is nothing but a source of embarrassment for `` europe '' . 
  absolutely . 
  it seems like it 's become respectable again to cheer for some random idiot in historical drag who claims superiority over everyone else merely because their ancestry consists only of similar idiots . 
  the whole notion is revolting and contrary to all political progress made in europe since the peace of westphalia . 
  it has no place in modern society . 
  a year ago i confronted the owner of one the foremost cheese stores in town about why saint-nectaire is n't available anywhere in the country . 
  he explained that the reason for this lies in the buying habits of germans who just wo n't pay any extra for food . 
  thus , french exporters prefer the uk market where customers are ready to pay any price as long as the quality is right . 
  as a consequence , the saint-nectaire and most other aop / aoc dairy products end up in british stores leaving only a couple few of the more common ones for the rest . 
  sad , but true : /, 
   ~ $ host en.wikipedia.org  en.wikipedia.org has address 198.35.26.96  en.wikipedia.org has ipv6 address 2620:0:863 : ed1a : :1 that 's weird . 
  for the a-record of wikipedia.org is 91.198.174.192 . 
  $ dig + short - t a en.wikipedia.org 91.198.174.192 this is `` text-lb . esams.wikimedia.org `` according to the ptr record . 
  198.35.26.96 has points to `` text-lb . ulsfo.wikimedia.org `` and uses the certificate you get . 
  the certs are from different assurers ( globalsign and digicert ) but either cert chain validates : 198.35.26.96:443 depth = 2 ou = globalsign root ca - r3 , o = globalsign , cn = globalsign verify return :1 depth = 1 c = be , o = globalsign nv-sa , cn = globalsign organization validation ca - sha256 - g2 verify return :1 depth = 0 c = us , st = california , l = san francisco , o = `` wikimedia foundation , inc.

'' , cn = *.wikipedia.org verify return :1 i 'm guessing wikimedia prefer a different server depending on your location which of course would be the smart approach . 
  ... and that is correct . 
  a bit of searching on their wiki reveals how it 's done : https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/servers -- so for now you 're good and those sites do n't appear like they 're being mitm 'd . 
  i 'd vote for it just to have saint-nectaire sold in supermarkets . 
   how long until france and germany merge as a nation ? 
  the prototype already exists , it 's called a * belgium * and also has a dutch part because it 's the luxury edition . 
   turkish wikipedia is just shitty . 
  the german one too . 
  no surprise here . 
  most serious contributors of * any * country will prefer improving the international one , leaving the regional ones an insignificant circlejerk . 
  the real damage done is primarily due to the blocking of `` en.wikipedia.org `` in the process . 
   here is how wikipedia looks to me right now :   http://i.imgur.com/o5ffuhv.png that 's pretty bad . 
  can you try https://91.198.174.192:443 directly ? 
  you will get a certificate warning because your browser ca n't associate the cert with a host name . 
  that 's expected . 
  if you get so far ( which means they 're merely blocking dns ) please check whether the fingerprint of the certificate matches this one : sha256 fingerprint = e8 :04 : b7 :5 c : f2 : b5 :0 b :1 f :41 : ee : b1 : bb :90:81:17:8 d :86:86:3 f :93:25:3 d :10:0 d :85:8 d : fb :3 d :51:20 : b8 :6 b in any event , looks like you 're in deep shit . 
  i sincerely hope that your country will recover from this before the damage becomes irreversible . 
   here is the sha256 fingerprint : 05 7a a6 b4 58 fd 66 b7 f1 a0 72 2b 2e 0c 9e it 's truncated . 
  sha256 has a hash size of 256 bits ( duh ) . 
  as a rule , truncation of a cryptographic token makes it less secure / veracious , so do n't do that unless you know what you 're doing . 
  anyways , those bytes you posted do n't match those i get here , not even partially : sha256 fingerprint = e8 :04 : b7 :5 c : f2 : b5 :0 b :1 f :41 : ee : b1 : bb :90:81:17:8 d :86:86:3 f :93:25:3 d :10:0 d :85:8 d : fb :3 d :51:20 : b8 :6 b this means that either wikipedia serves you a different cert ( unlikely ) , someone serves you a forged cert ( possible thanks to x. 509 ) , or you messed something up in the process . 
   i can access it but i am using dns . 
  what ip address does wikipeda.org resolve to for you ? 
  ~ $ host wikipedia.org wikipedia.org has address 91.198.174.192 wikipedia.org has ipv6 address 2620:0:862 : ed1a : :1 wikipedia.org mail is handled by 10 mx1001.wikimedia.org . 
  wikipedia.org mail is handled by 50 mx2001.wikimedia.org . 
   would n't that have a different fingerprint ? 
  well , guess why i was asking them to post the fingerprint .
