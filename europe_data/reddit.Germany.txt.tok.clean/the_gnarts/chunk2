  * they * have it hard !, 
   do you guys learn flags in school ? 
  our geography class made us remember flags , capitals and locations of like eighty countries - all of european ones , most of american , more than half of african ( that was pretty hardcore to be honest ) and such . 
  same here ( de ) . 
  as you say , africa was torture . 
  it 's also the knowledge most frequently invalidated . 
  shit , now i wish there was a way to re-enable css per subreddit . 
   kinda hard to be socialist without being internationalist though [ comrade stalin already sorted out the ideology for that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialism_in_one_country ) so it does n't make for much of a counterargument . 
   appenzell innerrhoden : confidential one of the [ least progressive ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/appenzell_innerrhoden#women.27s_right_to_vote.2c_1991 ) areas of europe , of course you 'd expect them to keep it secret how much they strayed from the righteous path , 
   according to this map not all of them are the map says absolutely nothing about that though . 
  just because they 're a single parent does n't mean they 're not ok , nor that they 'd be better off sharing parenthood with somebody else . 
   source : getting to si , ja , oui , hai , and da . 
  source ? 
  lol . 
  no references , just a graph without any hint about where the data originated . 
  that 's about as solid as daydreaming . 
   the germans have another kind of parenthesis , which they make by splitting a verb in two and putting half of it at the beginning of an exciting chapter and the other half at the end of it . 
  can any one conceive of anything more confusing than that ? 
  these things are called `` separable verbs . '', 
  the german grammar is blistered all over with separable verbs ; and the wider the two portions of one of them are spread apart , the better the author of the crime is pleased with his performance .

  fun fact : the most recent model of passenger trams ( now that we need to make that distinction ! ), 
  in dresden are famous for having been the longest in any german town at the time of their introduction . 
  in the meantime i believe other cities like leipzig ordered a batch of the same model so that 's no longer true . 
  * i worship the shadow !, 
   ehm ... this data might account for people who live say just across the border in annecy but work in geneva . 
  they 're swiss , just chose to live in a cheaper suburb . 
  probably basel / weil / saint-louis as well . 
   pretty shitty score and cinematography though . 
  that would depend mostly on the reader . 
   however , any full-scale cyber attacks abroad would have to be approved by the german parliament , just like any other military mission .

   what 's the bitrate on that ? 
  bandwidth-wise , nothing beats sending hard disks in the mail ( or by the truckload if you 're serious ) . 
  it 's the latency that sucks . 
   so . . goodbye privacy ? 
  not at all . 
  if you 're affected by this , then you 've said `` goodbye '' to your privacy long ago . 
  what they 're lamenting is :  at the moment , prosecutors , judges , also police and law enforcement authorities , are dependent on whether or not providers will voluntarily provide the access and the evidence . 
  this is not the way we can facilitate and ensure the security of europeans , being dependent on some voluntary action they 're concerned with data that these `` providers '' ( mostly companies whose business model consists of hoarding tons of data about people ) already possess . 
  for privacy reasons , it makes no difference whether it 's facebook or the police department of luxembourg can access the data , or both . 
  if it 's out there , unencrypted , in the hands of a third party , then * you * already lost . 
  this shit here is just government vs. companies fighting over turf . 
   why can these people not get it through their fucking skull that this will do nothing to prevent terrorism . 
  that 's not the point . 
  the core of the powerplay is our politicians laying a claim to the same data that us law enforcement has access to because of the explicitly sabotaged encryption in services like skype . 
  it 's about being afforded equal status ( = = access rights ) by companies that have users or even customers on european soil . 
  the solution is -- as it always has been -- to not donate your data ( nor your company 's nor your customers ' ) to a third party . 
  i. e. either build your own infrastructure or at least ensure that things you upload to other people 's computers ( a. k. a. 
  `` the cloud '' ) is encrypted in a way that the storage provider never has access to the plaintext . 
  ( the latter is just common sense , always was even before the cloudflare catastrophe of last month . ), 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/junker edit : the article is surprisingly good , i recommend you read it even if you 're familiar with the term . 
  they have n't figured out how to put them in the vacuum suits yet , but the research is ongoing . 
  looks like a promising research project to invest all those funds in that they took from nasa 's earth sciences program . 
   yeah i really wonder why german shows are n't famous world wide , when everyone speaks english as their second language . 
  in this case it 's not about the language , really . 
  the productions just suck badly . 
   news of the dutch elections and wilders ' debacle take a little bit longer to reach the moon what the hell are they using for a medium of transmission ? 
  ca n't be radiowaves , the latencies would be much shorter ... 
  my favorite : the * [ palochka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d3%80 ) * \u04c0 ( cyrillic letter palochka , u +04 c0 ) . 
  used as a marker for aspiration in various caucasus languages , it technically lacks a lowercase variant . 
  ( or more precisely , the casing property does n't apply to it . ), 
  but the unicode folks , anticipating that nothing is as hard to eradicate as bad programmers ' habits , added a makebelieve lowercase variant ( u +04 cf ) as well . 
  also just for the lulz i 'll throw in the `` multiocular o '' \ua66e which is little more than a doodle by some monk scribe that found its way into a few copies of religious texts . 
   counting y and \u0423 as the same letter but they are . 
  in ancient times , greek \u03c5 / \u03a5 denoted a vowel much closer to / u / , especially in dialects , just that the language eventually converged on something closer to / \u00fc / . 
  it found its way into cyrillic via the first branch as \u0443 / \u0423 , and into latin via both as u\\/u and y/y . 
   it 's a pity that usernames are n't ordinarily canonicalized when checking the uniqueness . 
  canonicalizing names ? 
  that 's a futile effort if there ever was one . 
  you can resort to disallowing anything outside the ascii letters or posix portable set , but do n't attempt to fix up users ' inputs with arbitrary rules . 
  it wo n't work because [ names are the most diverse and irregular part of language ] ( http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/ ) , not to mention pseudonyms used as handles on websites . 
  the only sane thing is to mandate that the input consist of valid unicode code points and nothing else . 
   and there was greek majuscule at the time that used c shape for sigma . 
  to be more specific , it 's the so called [ `` lunate sigma '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lunate_sigma#lunate_sigma ) . 
   one of the books i studied for my comparative law exam is `` an introduction to comparative law '' by konrad zweigert & hein k\u00f6tz . 
  i looked it up on amazon . 
  [ one critic ] ( https://www.amazon.de/review/r3i8k9h2ahugqx/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=utf8&amp;asin=3161465482&amp;channel=detail-glance&amp;nodeid=299956&amp;store=books ) gives it a low rating because it 's a mere collection of descriptions of individual cases and field studies , not accessible unless the reader already brings with them solid knowledge of comparative law . 
  that does n't sound like it 'd work as an introduction for lay people who do n't have the luxury of a university course or lecture to accompany the book . 
   any answer that goes deeper than that would require a crash course in comparative law . 
  any book recommendations for familiarizing oneself with the differences between common law / code civil / german law as a non-lawyer ? 
   and once again portugal is the eastern european of western europe that 's geographically sound . 
  the globe wraps around , after all . 
   it 's `` 10p cheaper than xyz '' , the actual price is higher . 
  especially if you factor in the long term cost for society caused by the damage to the readers ' minds . 
   bbc does a daily feature on the next day paper covers . 
    http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-the-papers-39426107 `` daily star 20p cheaper than the sun '' -- rofl . 
  i guess it 's still true that [ the sun readers do n't care who runs the country as long as she 's got big tits ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgscoauww2m ) . 
   they get crowned by the business economists in german universities and often talked about in lectures . 
  never understood why . 
  cause bwl , 
   used to live in berlin , and the consensus among other developers there is to stay the fuck away from any rocket company . 
  or even simpler , to `` stay the fuck away from berlin '' entirely  jokes aside , rocket internet are a disgrace . 
   let 's not overreact , yes it causes some extra deaths , just like it prevents deaths when people get to sleep one extra hour in october . 
  an extra hour of sleep is n't the problem though . 
  you can have that quite easily by ... duh , sleeping an hour longer . 
  doing that once a year will likely have no measurable effect on an individual 's overall health . 
  the nasty bit is the pervasive change in the daily schedule that messes up the circadian clock . 
  for the extra hour in autumn it 's easy to compensate , whereas the `` stolen '' one in spring has drastic consequences .
