  the circadian rhythm is a weird thing : while it 's easy to adapt to a later period ( e. g. cest \u2192 cet ) , the other direction is much harder and it takes weeks to get up to the same performance levels as before , even if it 's `` only an hour '' . 
  for general health reasons , there 's pretty much only evidence against it , though depending on where you live , the `` summer time '' or `` winter time '' -- whatever is closer to local time under the normal business hours -- may be the preferred choice . 
   would n't mind some sources * https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24679223 * https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25979095 * https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17964164, 
   it 's wrong . 
  very . 
  not , wrong , just missing some late latin deformation , 
   just another proof that russia does n't like having a strong opponent next door . 
  * the soviet union, 
   there still could 've been a great monarchy if only you were willing to join prussia !, 
  not again . 
  poor france ... 
   as if that is really all we do around here !, 
  you also know the secret of creating soil from saltwater . 
   hey , chances are you work for a company that would n't sell shit compared to its competitors if it was n't for the marketing bullshit they did . 
  plausible but irrelevant . 
  it does n't make marketing any less bullshit . 
   your ability to correctly fly a flag , not so much . 
  what an amazing failure at maintaining symmetry . 
  i never knew !, 
   it 's pretty much how all design works . 
  * marketing bullshit * is the proper term . 
   do n't think it 's indo-european actually , but obviously the same as latin . 
  wiktionary has some [ decently sourced speculation ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%ce%bf%e1%bc%b6%ce%bd%ce%bf%cf%82#etymology ) on the topic . 
  [ * v\u012bnum * ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vinum#latin ) are considered to derive from a common pie predecessor ** w\u00f3yh \u2081 nom * with analogues in other mediterranean language families . 
   i 've never understood the appeal of coffee , personally . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caffein#enhancing_performance  i ca n't get over the disgustingly bitter taste . 
  there 's so many varieties of coffee and not all of them taste bitter . 
   you are a history major that wants to spread bad history ? 
  they 're a history major who appreciates a good joke . 
   flying the german flags is still , at the very least , borderline . 
  otoh they 're probably not out-right nazis as those would n't be seen dead flying those colours , black-red-gold being the colours of german democracy , after all . 
  that 's an important distinction . 
  you can recognize nazis by the black-red-white ( instead of - gold ) colors of the reich . 
   amsterdam-brussels at 200kmh wait , that goes for `` high speed '' over there ? 
   yes ... 
  yes you do . 
  if copyright can expire , and it can in germany ( sorry to lecture you on your own country here ) there 's such a thing as public domain . 
  gemeinfreiheit is a different concept . 
  german law disallows relinquishing author 's rights to the benefit of some entity ( selling them ) or everyone ( putting your work in the public domain ) . 
  the latter is clearly the situation referenced by the post i was replying to :  there are public domain works * licensed * in germany ( my emphasis ) . 
  people do n't `` license '' things by being dead for 70 years . 
  an author can not release their work to the public domain in germany even if they wanted to , so using an actual license for the work is the way to go . 
  mit or cc0 , depending on the use case , do the trick and express the intention most people have when they want their work pd ' ed . 
   there are public domain works licensed in germany , that are part of the public domain everywhere . 
  there are no `` public domain works licensed in germany '' . 
  german law does n't even have the concept of `` public domain '' . 
   internet is already way too regulated indeed , but some companies unilaterally imposing ridiculous conditions like `` the requirement for any user of the services worldwide to sue the company in the state of california '' is n't a desirable status quo either . 
  between them and some nation state , it 's just another turf war about whose cohort of suits gets to make the rules . 
  not that i 'm much of a fan of either side but in doubt i 'll go with the elected ones . 
   angela merkel looks like a kindergarten teacher nowadays . 
  kindergarten physics teacher . 
  she should really consider that for her retirement . 
  this time the arms dealers went with payment in kind ? 
  i agree with you actually . 
  i 'd be voting much more frequently if i did n't have to bend the weekend plan to accomodate a formality . 
   he is n't the one doing the `` ourdissage '' ( plot-hatching ) , he is the target of it , so no . 
  yeah , [ i just got that too ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=accb44cc8ui ) . 
   however you could call him a corrupt hypocritical piece of shit . 
  what about calling him an autist ? 
   has opposed to elections during weekends when everyone just goes off to the beach/mall and neglects to vote ? 
  over here , malls are closed on sundays not only when elections take place . 
  we do n't have that many beaches though i would n't be surprised if those are closed as well . 
  nl elections take place on a workday ? 
   my dictionary tells me `` ourdissage '' my dictionary knows neither term . 
  i suck at french but please tell me : if fillon is convicted because of this , do we get to call him an `` ourdisseur '' ? 
   i generally do n't care about internal news to china or india , which is all you 'd see if it were just raw number of interested viewers . 
  unlikely . 
  search engines do n't consider raw supply numbers alone . 
  otherwise even in the english part of the language continuum , ads would dominate the field and , e. g. a site like wikipedia would be outranked by random clone of itself with every search . 
  same for online participation , where english is the de facto standard that the world converged on long ago . 
  neither chinese nor any of the many languages of india even get close to this kind of dominance . 
  geoip increases the potential an individual has to overcome in order to participate and thus contributes to more people remaining on the inside of the bubble they happen to start out with . 
   / #exbrit backslash ( `` \\ #exbrit `` ) !, 
  good one nonetheless . 
   i thought r/europe was a default r/all sub . 
  no , that 's a geoip induced illusion . 
  sadly , using the internet as a means of escaping your local information bubble is getting harder every minute . 
   they obviously drive poor polish felows to their early graves . 
  can confirm . 
  had a polish girlfriend years ago . 
  her ex killed himself . 
  luckily i got away before the same fate hit me . 
   these towns are what i like about germany the most . 
  unfortunately i did n't make it to rothenburg because it seemed to be impossible to go there with public transport ( from mannheim ) , get a touring bike  i passed franconia last year and crossed the tauber river a bit downstream from rothenburg . 
  i remember it as one of the most picturesque parts of the entire ride . 
   there is considerable speculation as to why the observable orthodoxy is composed almost entirely of ordinary orthodox believers as opposed to an even mixture of orthodox and anti-orthodox . 
  this asymmetry of orthodoxy and anti-orthodoxy in the visible mankind is one of the great unsolved problems in theology . 
  [ 6 ] the process by which this inequality between orthodox and anti-orthodoxy believers developed is called ecumenogenesis . 
   people here should read on the events . 
  it 's always good to have more information before forming your opinion . 
  complementary reading : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genocide for the definition . 
   technically , since the graph says `` leasure time '' , would commuting count ? 
  unless you 're being payed for the commuting time , it certainly should count as leisure . 
   running , for example , is pretty boring to me as well , if it 's the leisurely `` jogging '' style that 's so popular everywhere . 
  shorten the distance , add steep slopes and sprint intervals , and you 'll be exhausted quickly without ever getting bored . 
  i 've grown quite indifferent to people boasting they completed [ 1/2 ] marathons since i discovered that running could be so much more . 
   sangria is what you make when someone gifts you spanish wine . 
  some of them are good for cooking too if applied with restraint . 
  ca n't say that about their olive oil . 
   i just wonder why that girl sucks the dutch flag .
