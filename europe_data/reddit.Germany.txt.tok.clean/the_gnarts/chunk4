  is n't it unpatriotic ? 
  that pic is also plagiarizing one of france 's most renowned cultural achievements : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-iysdfu_tq, 
   both are numbers but float has decimals . 
  you can have decimals with integers too , just scale them as you like to slide the decimal point . 
  the difference is much more profound . 
  `` floats '' ( probably doubles ) use a very different representation than integral types : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ieee_754 -- on many types of hardware this maps to machine types that use different registers than integers and may have distinctly [ weird bit width ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extended_precision#need_for_the_80-bit_format ) . 
  edit : recommended reading : http://www.validlab.com/goldberg/paper.pdf, 
   pretty sure it 'd still be 150 do n't mix float and int without casting . 
  it 's bad style and can introduce subtle bugs . 
   aldi talk : yeah , but the real question is : can aldi s\u00fcd talk talk to aldi nord talk ? 
   church has to stop being the highest authority in this country and it wo n't be long after that . 
  the current pope looks like he might just be the type to issue such a decree , thereby saving poland the hassle of getting rid of their religion first . 
   , racism is a really really minor problems in homogenous states such as czech republic and japan you do n't have the slightest idea of what you talk about . 
   quantum computing could change that . 
  when talking about quantum computing i have to remind people that there are some challenges to quantum computing that we are never able to solve . 
  actually , there 's been a ton of research already into post-quantum crypto so it 's not like we 're going to be taken completely by surprise when the first machine runs shor 's algorithm : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/post-quantum_cryptography, 
  behold , another variation on the traditional `` senile bureaucrats vs. mathematics '' theme . 
  too bad they again will have to take it back the next time they 're up for an ass kissing trip to the banks . 
   why is it so averagely sized now ? 
  who taught you how to do averages ? 
   fake flags the technical term is `` false flags '' . 
   the rhineland was full of raw materials like coal and steel that is important on jumpstarting the industrialisation of prussia/germany . 
  at that time , silesia equally contributed to prussia 's economy . 
  two powerhouses about an equal distance to the east and to the west , respectively , which fueled the pomp and the wars of berlin . 
   wait till you see baarle-nassau/hertog ... 
  honorable mention : the dutch-french border of [ saint-martin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_martin ) . 
   hoerenzeune that translates well into german , actually . 
   police confirms no foreign background the car has a hamburg license plate . 
  does that not count ? 
   i 'll be in nrw all around  as they say : `` rheinl\u00e4nder raus ! '' ( jk , enjoy your carnival . 
  it 's perfectly normal for a grown up individual to have this kind of kink , or so say the psychologists . ), 
   you actually ca n't cycle on this particular street ( pedestrians only ) as of last year due to some stupid regulations . 
  sounds awful . 
  i was really curious about those mountains though , 
   dude , this is fasching weekend . 
  i 'm partying for three days straight , starting tomorrow . 
  considering fasching fun will get you committed in these parts of the country . 
  thanks for the summary . 
  but regarding that mountain  -- from the looks of it it 's got to have its share of grueling climbs . 
  amazing view . 
  how 's cycling in the area ? 
   cape verde one are n't exactly waves but that was the best i could find . 
  this one looks the most interesting btw. , like reoccuring parabolae . 
   we 're all netherlands on this blessed day even spain ? 
   and klopse are afaik cooked and not fried in a pan like frikadellen . 
  on the first day . 
  the second day you fry the leftovers , naturally . 
   a beefsteak is something different . 
  what 's wrong with sachsen ? 
  fwiw among older people it 's pronounced * beffsteck * ( approx .

  glorious . 
   i remember him as vercingetorix , only ever read the comics in german . 
  i 'm referring to the first movie : http://www.asterix-fanclub.de/lexikon/db/haudraufwienix.php they really butchered this one . 
   aw , you 're missing the joke with assurancetourix there ( the bard ) !, 
  the german translation is pretty meh in general . 
  you do n't even want to know what they did to vercingetorix ... 
   the dutch barley wash their hands not sure you 're reading this right . 
  the map says `` washing with * soap * and water '' -- which is a bad idea to do too often since it wipes out the bacteria living on your skin , making room for alien , potentially pathogenic microorganisms that would otherwise not stand a chance in that environment . 
  most of the time when washing your hands , water is all the solvent you need . 
  now write that 100 times !, 
   there 's got to be some major downsides to having these agencies scattered in 40 different cities . 
  sure you 'll find some . 
  but decentralization just proves itself robust in the long run . 
  look how only two institutions need migrating off the sinking ship now instead of potentially dozens . 
  [ no time toulouse !,

   i just came here for balkan banter . 
  there 's some things one can still rely on in this day and age . 
   the netherlands is the biggest agricultural powerhouse on this map though in terms of net exports . 
  at the polder museum the guide claimed that reclaimed land is the most priced soil among dutch farmers . 
  yet on this map it 's awarded only a 4 or 5 in terms of quality -- looks like most of europe does n't have much to complain . 
   strangely enough , this seems to almost correlate inversely with economic development . . 
  i see a stronger correlation with climate , latitude ... 
    typical german `` fairy tale '' castles . 
    as if there 's a whole bunch of those , hehe . 
  there is . 
  in fact that epithet fits most 19th century romanticist builds like for instance [ hohenzollern ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hohenzollern_castle ) . 
  it 's also not exactly specific to germany , considering [ one of the prime examples ( carcassonne ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eug%c3%a8ne_viollet-le-duc ) is in france . 
   the elites should rule not some dirty citizens just as the czech president used to be assigned by the parliament until quite recently . 
  we all know [ how it turned out ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo2l25rk750 ) when that was changed ... be that as it may , nobody would say german presidents have been particularly presentable in the past : - weizs\u00e4cker , son of a high ranking ss official and christian lobbyist ; - herzog , who could n't distinguish the warsaw uprising from the uprising the warsaw ghetto ; - rau , coal subsidies and another christian lobbyist ; - k\u00f6hler , not smart enough to not tell the truth ; - wulff , christian fundamentalist who could n't handle petty corruption ; - and gauck , a priest who did n't mind the surveillance state unless it was run by commies . 
  considering these people , it 's only fair to not have them wield any real power . 
   thats look beautiful it 's the quarter called [ `` little france '' ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/la_petite_france_\\ ( strasbourg \\ ) ) ... 
   wait , that exists ? 
  not officially , i suppose . 
   100k usd per year is n't very much it is in most places . 
  the number of people affected by the double tax is negligible . 
   the reason americans expat is typically for high paying jobs ( same reason everyone else expats ) ... i mean why else move out of your country , your home ? 
  for any number of reasons . 
  i 'm not certain any of the expats i know -- and they may even be the majority of my acquaintances -- moved to another country for economic reasons . 
  better climate , experience , the culture , food , general curiosity , a decent job ( not necessarily better paying ) , friends , ... it 's pretty much the same spectrum of motivation for moving around inside your home country . 
   which means our gdp is like ~ 10 % more than it looks , so out debt/gdp is like ~ 157 % only that 's the * official * debt . 
  how much is your * shadow debt * ? 
   the one caveat is if he made under a certain amount that year , approximately 100k usd ... so he probably owes the irs nothing since you do n't earn that in africa . 
   now if he lives and works in another western country he probably makes over the ~ 100k usd cutoff and he has to pay tax to the irs as well as whatever country he is in . 
  i discussed this with an american the other day .
