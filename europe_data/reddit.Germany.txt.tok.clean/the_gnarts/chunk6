    if the state pays for your upkeep ? 
  in case you had n't noticed , a subsidized job is exactly that : the state paying for people 's upkeep . 
  except that fictional jobs take away actual work because noone is able to compete with subsidized wages . 
  which amount to a loss for society as a whole because that money could have been spent on research or infrastructure . 
  just an example where a government willing to pay anything to increase the number of `` jobs '' created on their bill : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zalando#controversies, 
   `` hmm that job barely pays enough to feed my family and i will likely face eviction , it would be irrational to accept it . 
  a more rational option would be to starve . '', 
  `` hmm that job does not pay enough to feed my family and i will face eviction regardless of whether i take it . ''  you really know nothing about how people live in most of the world . 
  do you ? 
    then it 's simply irrational to accept the job   are you fucking twelve ? 
  people need to eat and feed their families . 
  do you live in some sort of bubble ? 
  that 's the point : it 's irrational to accept a job that does not allow one to `` eat and feed their families '' . 
    better spend that time doing something useful instead : staying healthy , volunteer work , educating yourself , etc. 
  that is a net improvement for everyone . 
   i know your daddy has always payed for everything you need but in the real world people have to work to survive . 
  do you realize that , right , mr. ultrarationalman ? 
  you know a lot , mr. 
   between people not working and working for low wages , i will always go for low wages . 
  that 's an oversimplification . 
  if the wages are so low they need to subsidized by the public ( coal subsidies anyone ? ), 
  then it 's a net loss for everyone . 
  if they are not subsidized at this kind of low rate , then it 's simply irrational to accept the job . 
  lastly , there is no point in keeping people working at all costs like some surrogate work programs do , because the extra stress on the individual ( for no economical gain whatsoever ) will end up being paid for by the public via the health system and pensions . 
  better spend that time doing something useful instead : staying healthy , volunteer work , educating yourself , etc. 
  that is a net improvement for everyone . 
   til macs allow forward slashes in file names . 
  could be u +2215 , u +2044 , or pua trickery if they control the font . 
  but i agree it 's * very * weird . 
   german vice chancellor sigmar gabriel said after friday 's inaugaration that germany might need a new economic strategy geared towards asia if the us government imposes protectionist policies . 
  which btw . 
  is a huge embarrassment to say because he implicitly admits that this kind of fallback plan concerning economic policy does not exist yet . 
  because it omits the czech part of silesia . 
  `` b\u00f6hmen , m\u00e4hren und schlesien '' would n't be a bad fit , albeit a bit unwieldy even in german . 
   `` tschechei '' was considered innappropriate because the word started life as a neologism more or less invented by the nazis , so people felt a new word was needed . 
  you mean `` resttschechei '' , do n't you ? 
  `` tschechei '' was common before 1933 to refer to the parts of czechoslovakia with predominant czech population collectively . 
  before the czech nationalist movement established itself in the 19th century , the constituents bohemia , moravia , silesia were usually used individually to refer to the respective administrative regions . 
  `` tschechien '' now is sort of a neologism but since it 's a proper derivative from the noun `` der tscheche '' ( cf. 
  `` armenien '' < - `` der armene '' etc. 
  ) , it 's really not half bad . 
  the situation is worse in czech , i believe , where `` \u010cesko '' has been officially declared the verbum proprium but most people will use \u010cesk\u00e1 republika or just \u010cr in conversation . 
  or worse , `` \u010cechy '' , which actually refers to just bohemia . 
   since we have solved all the technical issues lol . 
  did n't they withdraw the demanding initial concept and ditch the air-suspension and other innovations ? 
  i guess it 's appropriate to say they `` solved '' this problem in some respect , just not the * technical * one . 
   to build a system connecting the 80 miles between brno in the czech republic to bratislava and then 140 miles south to the czech capital prague . 
  medieval units of measure aside , did anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of geography proof-read the article ? 
   https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/7697424908_785e26c5b9_o.jpg?w=738 that 's by far the shittiest image of prague i 've ever seen . 
   proclaimed in versailles , ended in versailles . 
  it was as true back then as it is today that the worst thing to happen to germany is a weak france . 
   man , people knew how to dress back in the day . 
  you mean [ those guys ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:napoleon_iii_otto_von_bismarck_\\ ( detail \\ ) . jpg ) ? 
   he ca n't have been to great , i can imagine in his class saying   `` between 1939 and 1945 nothing happened whatsoever '' that 'd be a miracle considering from my years of history lessons in germany i barely remember we talked about anything * but * nazi germany . 
  ( hyperbole , sure , but not by much . 
  i almost failed my final history exam because i drew a question about napoleon and could n't remember ever having heard about the guy in class . 
  had to improvise with what i could recall from war and peace ... ), 
   and let 's not forget schr\u00f6dinger 's immigrant , stealing jobs and benefits at the same time . 
  i thought that was the plan with hartz iv subsidized pseudo-jobs all along ? 
  for those of us who are n't into cars it would be informative to know the retail price of each model . 
  prague had the [ world 's largest monument of stalin ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/letna_stalin_sousosi.jpg ) located in the letn\u00e1 park overlooking the city from where the metronom was erected later . 
  finished after comrade dzhugashvili 's death , it was [ demolished ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/blowing_up_the_stalin_monument.jpg ) already in 1962 during the anti-personal cult measures of khrushchov . 
   but that 'd mean we 'd have to make rome to capital . 
  this has the potential of solving the brussels / strasbourg controversy in an instant . 
  also why not ? 
  rome deserves to be the seat of a second political power of worldwide renown . 
  after the vatican i mean . 
   how about the greater hanseatic league ? 
  make l\u00fcbeck the historical capital and keep everything else in brussels ? 
  too localized , too commercial . 
  also we 'd have to get russia into the boat too because of the role of novgorod 's gotenhof . 
  `` this is supposed to be a happy occasion . 
  let 's not bicker and argue about who killed who ! '', 
   holy european empire ? 
  bring back the hapsburgs ? 
  you know what , i 'll upvote that just because i 'm in austria this week . 
  other than than , why not revive the pre-caesarian roman republic ? 
  they were determined anti-monarchists and more roman than the hre could have ever gotten . 
   some very nice shades of green with no-script . 
  is that battery ever going to be fully charged ? 
   ca n't we just keep the european union as name . 
  we do n't want to come across as a knock off . 
  does it really matter ? 
  unless it 's '' kingdom of europe '' or anything in that vein discussing the name of the project is mere bikeshedding . 
   well if you 're looking for good soviet sci-fi you can move on the strugatzkis and lem !, 
   the share of companies facing problems in finding skilled employees in romania is double compared to the eu average , said corina-bianca gonteanu , manpower marketing director for europe . 
  what the actually wanted to write is `` ... problems in finding skilled employees * willing to work for the salaries offered * ... '' . 
   where do people eat other than the few tourist traps around the square ? 
   i think this also has to do with the fact that reproducibility and peer review are less of an organisational issue there ( due to the nature of the work being done ) . 
  reproducibility is of very little concern to the publishing process . 
  review sure , but many studies are so bleeding edge that the necessary equipment for reproducing them is out of scope for most labs except for maybe a handful worldwide with the same area of specialization . 
  even those ca n't allocate resources just because someone wants an article published . 
   so it 's basically open access via the back door . 
  emailing the authors for a pdf copy usually works too . 
  still a huge mess if you want a central repository of knowledge or at least index of metadata . 
  information age my ass . 
   as other posters said . 
  dismissing an entire article simply because you do n't like the publication is a weird and worrying trend around here . 
  a link to the original study would be the best solution . 
  no middle-men like focus that only diminish the credibility of facts .
