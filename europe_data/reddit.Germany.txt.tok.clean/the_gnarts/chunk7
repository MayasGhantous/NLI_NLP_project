  of course the monarchies exist . 
  the intrinsic superiority of certain humans by virtue of their mere birth is what 's deluded and despicable .

   what about austria and later austria-hungary ? 
  furthermore , the 1804 construct of the austrian empire never achieved the necessary interior stability to form a long term political entity . 
  what 's left of a czecho-moravian and slovakian unity ? 
  only the fact that after b\u00edl\u00e1 hora they belonged to the habsburg crown . 
  that 's little to nothing compared to what the numerous unions of lithuania and poland achieved from krevo to lublin : both countries merged into a single entity over the progress of centuries . 
  imo the little precedent for the formation of the first republic in 1918 made it a much more impressive accomplishment . 
  ukraine is really a missed opportunity at a pun on the [ union of brest ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_greek_catholic_church ) . 
   other than language and ethnicity , we 're identical , given our shared 700 years of history . 
  more like the exact opposite . 
  slovakia and the czech lands did not have a `` shared history '' until 1918 [ 0 ] . 
  also , their languages are mutually comprehensible and form a linguistic continuum with pretty recognizable gradient through moravia . 
  [ 0 ] unless you want to count `` great moravia '' until 1000 but the extent of its territoriy is still largely speculative . 
   that 's all you got ? 
  very disappointed . 
  looks to me like this is from a bohemian perspective . 
  in moravia it 'd be you who 'd get the predicate `` big sister '' .

   margaret thatcher agreed that it was better to go with the american shuttle , which was cheaper and had a better safety record . 
  [ ... ] the shuttle launch was priced at # 58m -- # 23m cheaper than ariane . 
  can someone please shed a light on how this would make sense ? 
  for one , the shuttle itself , technological miracle that it was , was one of the most expensive and oversized projects ever undertaken by mankind . 
  even the megalomaniac soviets wondered what the assumed hidden military purpose could be behind it because they had done the math and found the size and construction effort in no way justifiable . 
  on the other side we have the ariane , a program dedicated to * commercial * -- as in `` economically viable '' -- spaceflight . 
  did the us really offer the brits that great a deal on shuttle flights ? 
  as to the `` safety record '' this is a strange thing to pull entirely considering the shuttle was built to carry a handful of humans into space along with the cargo . 
  the ariane was always an unmanned vehicle , so whatever `` safety '' numbers one can pull , they are purely economic circumstances and the risk of losing payload occasionally on account of an ariane crashing would have to be factored into the estimated launch fee . 
  i 'd totally jumped to their support if they had argued that the shuttle is by far the more awesome vehicle and therefore deserved support more than the much more boring ( and commercially appealing ) ariane . 
  but those two reasons stated by thatcher i ca n't buy unless they are accompanied by solid numbers . 
   not that i want to defend these obvious idiots , but being a ` national socialist ' is not necessary a nazi , is it ? 
  there is at least one influential political party of that name that preceded the nsdap : the [ `` czech national social party '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_national_social_party ) of austria hungary and later czechoslovakia . 
  one of its most prominent members was edvard bene\u0161 , the foreign minister of the first czechoslovak republic and first postwar president of czechoslovakia . 
  ( afair he personally would have preferred to remain independent and only joined the party though due to pressure from other politicians who disliked the idea of a minister without a clear political affiliation . ), 
  politically , this party had little in common with the nazi movement that came to power in weimar germany in the 30s . 
  interestingly though , there existed a very close ideological counterpart to the nsdap in czechoslovakia : the [ dnsap ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_national_socialist_workers'_party_\\ ( czechoslovakia \\ ) ) whose founding in 1918 predates that of the former and which served to some extent as a model for hitler 's organization . 
  so you are indeed correct in that not all national socialists are in fact nazis , but most of them are and historically , most of them have been all along . 
   just a question , i thought germans read about the norse gods , no ? 
  probably because the names look unfamiliar ? 
  we 're used to slightly different spelling and pronounciation : * frej : freyr ( or \u201e froh `` if you 're into wagner ) , * oden : wodan or odin , * ymer : ymir , * as far as i can tell , ale and atle are n't gods but common given names . 
   the stuff is next to free , piped to my kitchen and safe to drink . 
  why would i not drink it ? 
  tap water is often chlorinated ( it varies , ask your local supplier ) and so could kill your gut flora which in turn would be detrimental to your immune system -- lots of hypotheticals here since despite some trying i have n't yet found any quotable research on that topic . 
  there 's also some findings regarding other negative health effects of common drinking water additives : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26186212 -- i 'm partial to tea myself so drinking water quality is quite a concern to me . 
  so i finally took the time to go through the survey . 
  when i clicked `` submit '' , i was immediately presented with this 400 error :  bad request   the browser ( or proxy ) sent a request that this server could not understand . 
  no proxy involved , normal firefox with all the js enabled for that site .

   i considered self defence classes for our boys but belive me no one would play along , they leave their families for a week maybe two up to even three . 
  when they come back they 'd rather spend time with their wives , play with kids or go out for a walk . 
  they do n't need such nonsense - a spedition firm owner explains . 
  unless , of course , the classes were to happen on company time . 
  but educating your workforce does n't appear a worthwhile investment even under the serious threat of them being robbed in their sleep .

    elsewhere in the reports , which are shared among eu officials and diplomats , frontex says people rescued by ngo vessels were often `` not willing to co-operate with debriefing experts at all '' with some claiming `` that they were warned [ by ngos ] not to co-operate with italian law enforcement or frontex '' . 
   this should be a felony with a lengthy prison sentence . 
  not at all . 
  it 's just generally good , practical advice that everything said before le unless filtered and supervised by an expert lawyer can only work to your personal disadvantage .
