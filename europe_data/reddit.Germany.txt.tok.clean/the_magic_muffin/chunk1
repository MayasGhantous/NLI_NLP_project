`` obersalzberg '' is a parody of the german version of `` the office '' called `` stromberg . 
  most is lost in translation but when you understand german it 's hilarious . 
  most of it is n't available with subtitles but [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oggos9mucae&amp;spfreload=10&amp;hd=1 ) 's one example . 
  * enters hitler * * hitler looks at stalin sitting on the wrong side of the couch * * laugh track * hitler : heil everyone !, 
  * laugh track *, 
  to be fair , the site is translated into `` munichpukes.de '' . 
  * i wrote this comment for the repost thread of this article , did n't see this post before . 
  * this has happened throughout isaf and rsm . 
  interpreters have been stuck in countries like germany for a long time , waiting for the government to recognize them . 
  most of them had to get there themselves , paying an incredible amount of money , families still at home , threatened by militants . 
  i remember a documentary where they interviewed an interpreter who tried to get to germany after working with the german army in kabul . 
  he was threatened with a knife , one night criminals fired at his door while he and his family were sleeping . 
  after that and numerous conversations with german government representatives he was allowed to come to germany , his family ( mother , father , wife and young child ) had to stay in afghanistan . 
  another example was a man from kunduz : he received multiple phonecalls by alleged taliban , they told him that he was no longer safe and they would kill him next time he left his house . 
  he also talked to german government representatives , they however claimed that he might be lying unless he comes up without any evidence . 
  taliban do n't write letters signed by the taliban .

  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_np8nyth1_m&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1h26m16s ) with more and more provinces and regions handed to the afghan security forces , interpreters have no chance other to flee on their own , often leaving family behind . 
  the situation is truly disgusting and one of the reasons why i expect future afghanistan to believe that we ( nato and western countries ) betrayed them . 
  afghanistan is a weird country but in kabul criminals do n't just randomly shoot at peoples doors . 
  the ones that threatened him with a knife made it clear that he is on their list because he worked as an interpreter .

  shooting guns is fun once in a while but when it becomes routine it ends up a lot less spectacular . 
  i always wanted to shoot an old bolt action on a shooting range , i assume that 's a lot more fun than modern rifles . 
  how is `` fear of the walking dead '' ( without spoilers if possible ) ? 
  i like the original series , did n't hear about the new one until recently . 
   also eu is unofficially a christian club shh . 
  do n't tell sweden , he might get upset . 
  having an increasing mexican minority is a lot safer politically than an increasing russian minority . 
  [ halt !, 
  come to us , we ran out of target practice . 
  jokes aside , i never ran over a bike and i never got run over but if you want to ride every day here you may want to wear a helmet . 
  http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49e48e0fa7f.html refugees in turkey might go up to 1.9 million this year , the sheer amount of people is too much to handle for turkey alone . 
  that 's what you get for exposing takeo ischi to the infidels . 
  the guy besides / u/freddie _ appshero - you 're shadowbanned . 
  bare in mind that almost none of those muslims are hardliners . 
  same goes for pretty much every religion in germany . 
  i know quite a few muslims , none of them eat pork however only one actually prays . 
  while running out of ammunition might be a bit problematic , shouting `` bang '' during training is nothing special . 
  pretty much every army around the globe does that now and then . 
  they hate us cause they ai n't us . 
  sweden no ? 
  they need a land bridge to crimea . 
  what 's better than being dragged away and a possible punishment by isis fighters ? 
  being caught in a firefight between isis and turkish forces where they may even be used as human shields . 
  oh wait , that 's not better . 
  that 's actually worse . 
  they would have fired back , leaving the soldiers without a chance unless they accept massive civilian casualties . 
  political circlejerk aside , the situation would have been much worse if one of the soldiers decided to intervene . 
  when a german soldier arrives at the airport in tropentarn ( desert camo ) i feel like people would rather spit in front of his feet than welcome him . 
  i enlisted a couple years ago and within the first few weeks of basic training i 've been called a murderer and shit like that numerous times ( mostly by punks sitting at the trainstation but that does n't make it better ) . 
  never underestimate the mighty sanctions !, 
  how can russia invade us when we blacklist their politicians ? 
  it 's not that we did n't like you guys or your empire . 
  we just did n't like that it was n't ours . 
  you ca n't say we did n't try . 
  i thought it was so obvious that i did n't include '' / s '' . 
  are you calling big bang theory dumb ?!, 
  i 'm not an expert on but the bmi is a not a good index since it only compares weight to height without including body fat and muscles . 
  for example a very muscular man would be counted as obese just like an actual overweight man . 
  what 's with that gluten free bs anyway ? 
  it 's all over the place on the internet but in reality i have never heard anyone mentioning it . 
  jimi hendrix liked those gypsy eyes .

  our sanctions would crush their advance . 
  our restrictions will shatter their dreams and haunt their nightmares !,

  the new hotline is a tin can telephone , easier to cut once things go wrong . 
  stalingrad for example was portrayed for decades as a strategic retreat by the red army , only a few years ago they released files that claimed that stalin wanted the soviets to fight until death and make sure that the wehrmacht did n't even made it there . 
   unless you have something against islam per se i have a problem with merging religion and state , no matter the country or the religion . 
  i consider the islamization of turkey by erdogan and his party a reason . 
  since people are stupid ( first comment i read on the guardian page was n't very bright ) i would like to add that germans do n't think this is normal either . 
  [ there 's a reason we used to call them landships .

  he just realized that he left his favourite cookies on the table at home and the dog will eat all of them . 
  we 're already doing that , trust me . 
  within the first two weeks of basic training you get your rifle but maneuver amunition does n't grow on trees and you have to clean the whole thing after you 've fired a single shot , therefore you often just pretend to shoot . 
  i also knew a former nva soldier who showed us wooden ak replicas they would use on a regular basis when going outside so they would n't have to clean their rifles afterwards . 
  ** tl ; dr ** this is completely normal , almost everyone does that to some degree . 
  i agree with your first statement . 
  bolt action rifles with iron sights , that 's fun to shoot , especially if you treat it as a sport . 
  the reflex sight and 3x scope of the g36 however are not . 
  they 're efficient and therefore eliminate the challenge you get from an iron sight . 
  i do n't understand why civilians would pay money for such an assault rifle . 
  sure but i do n't consider it worth a few hundred bucks plus money for ammunition so i can shoot at targets on a range . 
  after five magazines it ceases to excite , it just becomes routine . 
  why would a civilian need a rifle in switzerland ?
