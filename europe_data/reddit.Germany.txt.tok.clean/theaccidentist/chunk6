  probably means getting rid of the nazis was ultimately a victory for the population which i 'd wholeheartedly agree to . 
  but what 's with the * little culture germany had * ? 
  this is quite big a deal, 
  you might be thinking of actual sociopaths which most prisoners are not . 
  would you please translate that into english ? 
  that 's power but certainly not * hard * power, 
  how is that ? 
  they have basically taken africa into their sphere of influence by now . 
  i guess so . 
  pro climate change scientists ... weather terrorists ruining good ole murica so to speak . 
   breaking : france experiences worst drought in history after influx of ~ ~ climate scientists . ~ ~ climate change sympathizers !, 
  i understand what you are saying , i would just like to add - planned economy \u2260 socialism . 
  in fact planned economy is rather exotic amongst the different economic models and that is because , yes : - bolshevism is quite exotic . 
  it became absolutely dominant and shaped what most people know as ** the ** socialism but it 's not . 
  that 'd be like saying manchester capitalism was ** the ** form of liberalism . 
  - communism is a misnomer entirely . 
  no society has ever described itself as communist , not even the soviets . 
  * communism * is to socialists what paradise is to christians : not there yet , and they know it . 
  - pe is not a cooperative model , not in the least . 
  it is literally a military chain of command . 
  - most things we associate with capitalist societies have nothing to do with self-interest , say liberal democracy for example - last and most important : if you define socialism as * only that one system these failed states had when they failed * and capitalism as * only those systems that survived * then by definition , we 'll have a winner . 
  i do n't think that 's a meaningful comparison however . 
  planned economy certainly does n't work well enough . 
  there are many other ( even quite a few other socialist ) models . 
  neither capitalism nor stalinist socialism are without alternative . 
  haha , in that sense the eastern block withstood greed and corruption just fine - it had both for a long time and the economy did n't collapse . 
  it was the people who would n't put up with the shit anymore politically ... which incidentally is exactly how the eastern block came into being ( revolution ) , right ? 
  so if anything both systems failed the same way in the same countries . 
  so ... capitalism is a bad model ? 
  wait what ? 
  there are hundreds of attempted murders against people who do n't look german enough but after one major event where some people who seem to be mostly some kevins having a blast loot some stores you 're scared of the left ? 
  when we protest and we expect media to cover it , why would we not have some slogans in english ? 
  it helps get our point across to a broader public . 
  it has little to do with it being not real . 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  he said they * can * be and yes , that means he compares the worst case with the usual case - which is exactly the point . 
  for example none of us would want to live in attic democracy . 
  augustus was widely held to have been a great ruler , as were trajan and hadrian . 
  no , i am not . 
  i said that for the given set of countries the left was the better side historically . 
  all the rest is a discussion you are having with yourself . 
  uhm yeah no . 
  south america . 
  and there cuba before < after revolution pinochet < democracy and so on . 
  both seem to not be in sa . 
  also they were staunchly stalinist . 
  whether that 's even leftism is debatable but it definitely is pretty crazy . 
  and even then it is hard to tell if the ussr was really worse than the tsars . 
  i 'd say they were not even that different in terms of human suffering . 
  maybe not good but looking at the history of chile , mexico , argentina , nicaragua and , heck , even venezuela and cuba i 'd say the left side was definitely the * better * side , for what that 's worth . 
   austrians should have gotten rid of their nazis instead of blaming ~ ~ the germans ~ ~ the other germans, 
  yeah ... well ... it 's not that simple . 
  big parts of the state pretty much refused to support democracy ( including their own government ) in many places . 
  that 's not even the bad part . 
  the really worrying thing is the reliance on astronomical amounts of money neesed to even run for office . 
  sanders being the obvious but unsurprisingly unsuccesful exception . 
  in economic theory shit has started before pistmodernism . 
  that 's a shame ... let 's leave him hanging as a warning for the others . 
  i def hope so but i have seen american 's statements in r/europe that were crazier than that and not a joke, 
  i think he did . 
  as i said : already weird but still in style . 
  wow , now that is some screwed up logic . 
  point being that one can only retract , if one had already made allegations . 
  possibly falsely . 
  but maybe not . 
  and all other governments are doing the same stupid thing !, 
  hitler up , buddy !, 
  username checks out . 
  if someone has to retract rape allegations ... 
  back when presidents already were weird but still had all the style . 
  not in the least but atleast he 's a halfway decent person so that way he might look very distant to republicans . 
  weird how he is famous for ww2 while being stuck in ww1 mentally . 
  prussia was the part of germany that resisted the nazis the most and became rather pro democracy . 
  according to the eagle - double stronk !, 
  i was friends with many poles in school , so i had the advantage of being guests to their moms . 
  for my own good i will just go with the idea that those moms also run their internet and i will not double check this one . 
  they were attacked , seized to exist , were re-formed and pushed to the west by stalin . 
  whatever the legal framework , they had little say in how it all went down . 
  oh well , are n't danes just norwegians with a hot potato in their mouths * , anyway ? 
  ) * how a norwegian friend explained the language difference to me, 
  slightly different dimensions , though . 
  well that was pretty much what patton suggested , the old fart . 
  wtf over 7bn ? 
  that is insane . 
  i 'd expect it to be rather homely , with a faint smell of cabbage and much less drunk than you 'd guess from the size of those glasses . 
  poland had a rather nasty government during that time . 
  of course hitler would have attacked anyway but that 's not to say there would n't have been conflict even without the nazis . 
  the whole concession of gdansk ( and how it was put into place ) was a tinderbox right from the start . 
  yep . 
  second roman empire right around the corner, 
  i do n't think they really needed any justification for that, 
  hehe ... hehehehe ... german here , i say : do it . 
  and report back how far you 've come in , say , two weeks from now ? 
  ... and everyone else west of modern day india, 
  i call your tabloids and for christ 's sake , i declare breitbart right here . 
  i beg you pardon , sir ? 
  fuck you , too  [ edit : let me rephrase - your kind is not welcome on this sub , go troll somewhere else . 
  i hear t_d is beautiful this time of the year ], 
  10 years is pretty quick . 
  usually it takes a couple of centuries until germans get the lesson from italians .
