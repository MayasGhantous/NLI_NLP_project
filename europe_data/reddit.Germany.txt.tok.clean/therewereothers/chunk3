  junker 's plan would have assigned 12000 refugees to poland . 
  you 're right , poland has n't signed any treaty forcing it to take in refugees from other eu countries , but if the eu can not show solidarity and adept in situations like this , standing agreements may be called into question as well . 
  to the intolerant thing , i did n't like your `` abide culture and traditions '' request , because that can be understood as asking people to give up their identity . 
  `` behave nicely '' is something i wholeheartedly agree with . 
   eu did not send the message to the northern africa , it was mostly germany if we talk about recent happenings . 
  there has not been an invite from germany either . 
  there have been talks about allowing people from camps near syria to apply for visa , but as it stands it 's only possible to apply for a asylum if you 're on german soil . 
  the only thing that did change was that our government allowed for refugees that had already been registered in other european countries to stay . 
  mostly because the countries responsible for them according to the dublin convention seemed incapable of handling the amount of people ( and given that greece and italy have been hit by the euro crisis and that hungary is comparably poor and small that 's understandable ) . 
  of course this step may have increased the pull towards the eu a little , but it 's far from inviting anyone . 
  the point is simply that we have open borders within the eu and people tend to travel to the countries where they expect the best accommodations . 
  legally hungary is responsible to host several times more refugees than germany does , but since that does n't work with such a huge number of refugees and we do n't want people to starve so close to our borders , our government has decided to accept most of them . 
  an all-european system ensuring that refugees with a legitimate claim to asylum get a right to stay and are provided for while their application is processed would probably decrease the overall number of refugees . 
  for one because knowing that they might not reach the country of their desire could deter economic refugees in the first place and because having more countries and hence more immigration officers handling the applications would make deporting economic refugees easier . 
  please do n't forget , no country has been asked to accept economic refugees - germany denies about two thirds of all applications for asylum and we 're currently implementing measures to make deporting people easier - but the ones that really needed to flee from the likes of isis should find a safe place in europe . 
  i know how the eu 's aid is distributed . 
  the point is , that poland does profit immensely from this money . 
  and please do n't forget that many , probably most , roads built with eu money would have been build anyway , hence the money does indeed work as a contribution to the state budget . 
  the point is that you can not cherry pick which part of a union you want . 
  you either take all or nothing . 
  that necessarily means accepting some disadvantages of the membership , so in the end your government will have to compromise , either by taking more refugees or less money ( well technically taking the same amount as before but paying a fee for not accepting refugees ) . 
  i 'm also a bit worried by your understanding of tolerance . 
  if you expect every immigrant to assimilate perfectly , you 're not really tolerant . 
  the word in itself means to [ `` accept or endure '' ] ( http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/tolerate#tolerate__2 ) [ '' the existence of opinions or behaviour that one dislikes or disagrees with '' ] ( http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/tolerance ) . 
  so while you can and should expect every new member of your society to learn the language and comply with your laws there is not much more you can ask for in a free society . 
  freedom of religion and asylum are human rights guaranteed by the eu charter of fundamental rights . 
  having a homogenous society is n't . 
  maybe . 
  the brain-drain thing is extremely hard to calculate . 
  on the one hand loosing physicians and other highly educated people can be problematic for a country , on the other hand it 's not only educated people that may relocate in the eu but everyone ( we 've had issues with immigrants from romania and bulgaria who allegedly only came here to receive welfare ) , so your brain drain may be one of the reasons why unemployment is comparably low in many eastern countries . 
  additionally diasporas tend to sent quite an amount of money to their families back home . 
  so open borders might actually be a win-win situation or a win-lose with the loser being the richer country . 
  western europe pays , via the eu 's development programs , billions of euros in aid towards the eastern countries ( and greece ) . 
  so it 's more like asking them to continue taking money but spending a fraction of it on refugees . 
  if poland opts out of taking refugees ** and ** taking the 12 billion $ it receives from the eu in net payments , everybody would be fine with it ... 
   if they want to act like the eu is a federal state , then we demand fiscal transfer and eu government so we can pay our doctors competitive wages so they stop leaving . 
  there is fiscal transfer to some extend . 
  germany pays about 12 billion euros more to the eu it receives , while romania receives 2 billion more than it gets . 
  if you 'd ask me these sums would increase . 
  i 'd be fine with imposing and eu-wide unemployment insurance and at least some form of medical coverage . 
  sadly that is n't going to happen , but i believe even the current sums are enough to expect a little help in other areas , i.e. 
  dealing with refugees . 
  secondly , i think you should know that the current voting systems for the ep mostly weakens bigger countries . 
  so if every vote counted equally germany and france would profit the most . 
  `` somehow it ended up in a push and shove with the police and she was ended up on the railway lines with riot police trying to pull her ** back ** '' i fail to see how the narrator blames anyone for anything here . 
  of course the information they gave turned out to be incomplete and misleading but it 's not even factually wrong . 
  in the end [ hanlons razor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hanlon's_razor ) applies :  never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity . 
  of course some will try to continue their journey , but that does n't mean that quotas would n't work in the long run . 
  you ca n't really use people in a overcrowded train only a few hours away from their desired destination as an example . 
  there are thousands of refugees in austria and from what i 've read those that stayed at a few days were quite content and okay with staying . 
  now i imagine the accommodation in some of the eastern countries may end not to be as good as in western europe ( although the wealth gap , is only a fraction of what it once was ) so there might still be an incentive to get to germany , but i doubt you 'd have to do more than refuse to accommodate people already registered in another country . 
  in terms of actual outcome : no in terms of bargaining power : yes it is - to a lesser extend - the same situation as in the last negotiations with greece . 
  if one side has more to lose than the other they will probably reach fewer of their goals . 
   2.2 % is n't catastrophic . 
  it 's a set back of roughly 1 year at current growth rates . 
  no , but 6,3 % to 9,5 % is catastrophic enough to let any politician loose the next election . 
  hence the eu side would have quite the amount of bargaining power when negotiating a free trade agreement . 
  which is why i do n't think your deal would be better than norway 's . 
  given that the remaining eu countries might have an incentive to deter other countries from leaving as well it might be worse . 
  ` punishing ' you for leaving might actually be something many countries ' leaders might deem necessary . 
  one percent of the uk 's gdp is about 30 billion $ , so if we 're using first year economics , the maximum charge for entering the eu market could very well be astronomic . 
  of course saying you pay 100 billion pounds a year just to stay inside the free trade zone , wo n't fly , but it 's not unrealistic to estimate that the net payments towards the eu ( which are comparably low , thanks to thatcher ) wo n't change . 
  of course there will be some kind of free trade treaty . 
  it 's likely to be similar to norway 's . 
  so you 'll probably [ pay a few billion pounds a year and still have to follow eu regulations in most areas ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/16/britain-would-be-diminished-by-leaving-eu ) . 
  i 'm not saying that you would n't gain some independence and save money in some areas , but unless you want to risk a catastrophic recession leaving the eu wo n't mean as much independence as you might expect . 
  it also means loosing the bargaining power being the biggest economic entity in the world brings with it . 
  we built excellent submarines ... 
  that is n't entirely true . 
  while most of their current area is located in syria , the preceding organisation was the [ islamic state of iraq ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_state_of_iraq#revival_isi.2fisil_in_iraq ) which was part of the insurgence against the american troops . 
  we 're not doing nothing . 
  not that we did n't try but when millions of people appear on your shores and borders it 's not really an option . 
  to blaming the us . 
  now of course the usa did n't create isis ( though your secret services may have armed some groups that now support / belong to isis ) . 
  and the real perpetrators are the fanatics fighting for isis . 
  however , it 's hard to argue that the american invasion of iraq has n't been a factor in destabilizing the region . 
  maybe the iraq would have descended into anarchy anyway - syria did with little foreign help - but given that saddam was a sunni i doubt the isis could have spread out over such a big region . 
  many current members , including current isis leader al bagdhadi , were also part of the islamic state of iraq ( isi ) and fought against the occupying forces of the us . 
  so all in all it is n't too far fetched to say that the usa shares at least to some degree a responsibility for the current situation . 
  at least in germany it 's not criminalized ( \u00a7 95 aufenthg if anyone wants to look it up ) if they have a case for asylum . 
  even in illegal cases , it 's not a really a crime but a misdemeanor . 
  we do n't lock people up for stuff like that . 
  i really do n't want another police state . 
  we 've had more than enough of that . 
   what i mean is , until their asylum is aprooved , why are they allowed outside refugee centers ? 
  because they have n't been found guilty of any crime . 
  and the vast majority are n't pirates . 
  he was talking about refugees who are already in turkey and have europe as the target of their journey . 
  if they could apply for asylum from turkey many would n't have to pay human trafficers but would just take a plane like tourists do . 
  i do n't think you could consider that outsourcing . 
  it 's a bit hard to say ( at least based on what i know ) . 
  during their first few months of stay they get 143 $ in ` pocket money ' . 
  but housing and food are be provided as well . 
  theoretically the total value of that has ( due to a bverg/supreme court decision ) to be the same as what people on welfare ( hartz iv ) receive , which is 359 $ plus rent . 
  6000 dk is about 803 $ but prices are about 4 % higher in denmark ( i used gpd/ppp data on wikipedia to calculate , no idea where to get the actual data ) . 
  so worth about 770 $ here . 
  given that rent is n't that expensive in most places in germany , i would guess that they can afford more in denmark . 
  but it does very much depend on where you live inside the country . 
  if it was copenhagen vs munich the german deal with included rent is probably better . 
  as far as i know france does , at least on principle , accommodate refugees .
