  the main difference is that the bnd 's programs in question were stopped two years ago . 
  actually even before they became public . 
  of course they are n't innocent and if you asked me there are probably hundreds of agents and government officials that should go to jail over this , but there is a difference between bad and worse . 
  could n't you simply do it with the same method used for calculating life expectancy ? 
  comparing the number of marriages ended by divorces in the n-th year with marriages ended by the death of at least one partner the n-th year . 
  then you could use this data to say how likely a newly wed couples marriage lasts . 
  did n't you legalize divorce only two decades ago ? 
  that might still skew the data . 
  if we did allow for unrestricted immigration this would indeed happen . 
  the current influx is just enough to offset the number of people the labour market lost due to overaging in the last few years . 
  so , unless this continues for years , the consequences will hardly be drastic . 
  that might happen and is probably my biggest fear regarding the whole refugee situation . 
  i do n't really expect welfare benefits in northern europe to go down to the american level , but if the economy does n't stay as good as it currently is , there might be some painful cuts in the future . 
   immigrants are not the same as illegal immigrants . 
  i know , hence the use of the word `` may '' . 
  if you regard all immigrants as a single group the lower rate of violent crime is fairly obvious . 
  what we can take from that is not that illegals are much more or much less likely to become criminals than natives , but that the difference is n't very big . 
   tell that to the citizen construction worker who ca n't get hired because illegal immigrants are undercutting him . 
  yes , there are people who will face increased competition and mainly for uneducated natives illegals undercutting them , may indeed lead to unemployment . 
  on the other hand anyone from the middle-class and above may actually from cheap labour . 
  my point is n't that illegal immigration is a good thing , but that there is no reason to panic . 
  the overall effects on the everyday life of the average citizen are indeed limited . 
   as company you are done if you get caught and many do not even want to risk it anymore . 
  trust me , that is n't true . 
  even if it were , the consequences would be miniscule . 
  we 're not talking about high tech conglomerates here , but smallish gmbhs that only have a handful to a few dozen employees and offer cleaning services , maybe also renovation or run a restaurant . 
  if anyone gets caught they can always let their company go bankrupt , sell everything to their wife 's / aunts/cousins new company and go on like nothing ever happened . 
  in taxes alone [ 50 to 60 ] ( http://www.taz.de/!5046928/ ) billion euros are illegally evaded every year . 
  there 's simply not much supervision . 
  to be fair in the other states the controls are stricter and there are other ways to find out about tax evasion and illegal labour , but both the tax offices and customs ( ` zoll ' which for some reason investigates informal labour ) are [ hopelessly understaffed ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/mindestlohn-finanzkontrolle-schwarzarbeit-fehlt-massiv-personal-a-998118.html ) . 
  by the way here are newer numbers about our informal sector : http://www.welt.de/finanzen/verbraucher/article137237503/schwarzarbeit-wird-jetzt-schnell-zum-existenzrisiko.html 335 billion $ of 2945 billion $ total gdp . 
  that 's still 11 % and twice what the us have . 
  say what you want , but everything i could find points to the fact that working illegally in germany is easier or at least more profitable than working illegally in america . 
   europe and us work very differently . 
  for example we have also tons of controls for illegal work so the chances to get caught by it are pretty good in the city . 
  i once believed that , too . 
  than i stumbled across the actual data : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/informal_sector#estimated_size_of_countries.27_informal_economy apparently the informal sector in germany is about twice as big as in the us . 
  i guess that some illegals in america actually pay taxes and therefore do n't end up in the statistic , but all in all europe appears to be a better place to do informal labour than america . 
  healthcare , okay i can believe that even though i 've heard that lack of a ` personnummer ' can cause problems . 
  but for anything else they 'd have to register ; the authorities wo n't just transfer money to an account number a random person gives them . 
  the same goes for housing and accommodation . 
  that 's what i was getting at . 
  making sure everyone has documentation is more of a protection for immigrants than for the rest of the population . 
  it 's bad for the illegals , yes . 
  the negative consequences for the rest of society are limited , though . 
  in the us [ immigrants may actually be less likely to commit violent crimes than the indigenous population ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mythical-connection-between-immigrants-and-crime-1436916798 ) . 
  yes , they 're likely to engage undeclared labour , but that 's hardly anything the police sets a focus on . 
  especially since the informal sector is in the double digits anyway . 
  but they will have to avoid anything that brings attention to them and most crimes do exactly that . 
  if i decided to shoplift the prosecutor would probably drop the charges if i paid a fine . 
  an illegal immigrant would risk deportation . 
  so the incentive to behave is much stronger than for the general population . 
  i do n't see that much of a problem with it . 
  not that i 'm in favour of people without documentation , insurance etc. 
  roaming around , but they do n't burden the welfare system and have a very strong incentive to follow the law , since being arrested implies a very high chance of getting deported . 
   it would be like sneaking into n korea and claiming you went there to play golf . 
  [ well apparently people actually do that . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dprk_amateur_golf_open ) even redditors : https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/3fk5y8 we have more than seven billion people in the world and some have the strangest ideas about what a good vacation should look like . 
  i agree with you that travelling to afghanistan is suspicious but it 's in no way proof of guilt .

  i agree with you that travelling to afghanistan is suspicious but it 's in no way proof of guilt . 
  i think more or less everyone has enough of a murderous fanatic in them to become violent after being imprisoned , mistreated and tortured for years . 
  from his point of view the west is evil because it did evil to him . 
  thus he has every reason to assume our press is lying and that isis ' propaganda is more believable . 
  that 's why guantanamo and other human right violations commited by the west are so terrible . 
  they do n't only cause harm to the direct victims but harm the credibility of western governments and media . 
  the problem is that it is n't impossible that he was in afghanistan for peaceful reasons . 
  thousands of western people went to afghanistan to provide aid , report for the media and some were probably crazy enough to play tourist . 
  if i had to guess i 'd assume that his motives for travel were rather sinister , but that is n't how it works . 
  he 's innocent until proven guilty . 
  no , it is n't . 
  they can be changed but only within strict limits . 
  i 'm assuming you can read german , so here are a few sources : https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ewigkeitsklausel  nach dem wortlaut von artikel 79 abs . 
  19 abs . 
  https://www.uni-trier.de/fileadmin/fb5/prof/oef005/andrea_grundrechte/fall_8/d3_fall_8_ewigkeitsklausel.docx.pdf  da art . 
  79 abs . 
  and that 's only what i found on google 's first result page ... additionally the bverg has derived quite a lot of things from article 1 . 
  my point was that most countries have found ways to `` convince '' refugees to to apply for asylum in them . 
  the expectation that they will be ( legally or illegally ) deported is enough , but i do n't think this expectation just came out of thin air . 
  anything added after the initial version does n't fall under the eternity clause . 
  and only basic rights are protected . 
  irc , the right to asylum as guaranteed by the grundgesetz does n't go further than what the european charta of human rights dictates . 
  so the fact that most asylum seekers in europe go to germany means that other countries simply go further in exhausting the constitutional limits to whose application can be denied or they violate the charta . 
  from what i 've read it 's probably a bit of both . 
  sort of . 
  german law is usually applied with regards to the intentions of the lawmaker . 
  given that it 's obvious that the people that wrote this law did n't want the articles 1 and 20 to be changed and that the option of making changes to article 79 ( 3 ) would contradict the whole idea of an eternity clause , article 79 ( 3 ) is more or less unanimously regarded as unchangeable , too . 
  the [ `` free and liberal constitutional order '' ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/freiheitliche_demokratische_grundordnung ) is sort of defined by the basic rights . 
  so you can not abolish any of the articles 1 to 19 without violating article 20 . 
  20 abs . 
  79 abs . 
   refugees are not entitled to chose their favorite country . 
  absolutely true . 
  redistributing refugees throughout europe and helping turkey to improve the conditions in their camps would be very good ways to mitigate the current problem . 
  i just wanted to say that it 's not possible to simply set a cap . 
  bavaria is kind of our texas ... 
  this is n't possible . 
  [ article 79 ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gg/art_79.html ) of our constitution says that the tenets of the articles 1 and 20 can not be changed .
