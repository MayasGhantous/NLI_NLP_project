  i can sort of read dutch , spanish and portuguese too . 
  i also like when people in international forums use abbreviations specific to ~ ~ the us ~ ~ their own country and assume everyone would have to magically know what those mean . 
  if i want to send something to another eu country , it 's * easier * for me to use my own stamps than to acquire stamps from the target country ( and anyway , i 'll just take it to the post office ) . 
  the post office people look up how much it costs , tell me how much to pay , the end . 
  how would * taking it there myself * or having to acquire stamps from the target country be easier ? 
  can i send a letter to germany from the us if i put on german stamps ? 
  i 'm a musician - is that `` white-collar '' ? 
  i have some repeating fixed appointments each week , then appointments , meetings and so on that occur at various random times , some of which i can schedule myself . 
  everything else , such as my office work , i can do whenever i like and mostly at home . 
  the appointments include mornings , afternoons , and evenings , depending on the day . 
  it 's all in various locations , so i 'm seldom in one place for more than three hours or so . 
  my work week and salary is calculated for 39 hours ; some weeks i do less , some weeks i do more , and it all evens out in the end . 
  it 's quite nice as i can make it fit my personal rhythm ; mostly i can avoid getting up early and rather do things late at night . 
  as long as i do n't miss my appointments and do all the work my job entails well , no one is going to ask how many hours i worked or when . 
  working at home i wear whatever is comfortable , for most outside things i wear normal street clothes , and for concerts etc. 
  formal clothes . 
   no , believe it or not , not everything we do has to do with the us . 
  seriously . 
  from posts here , you 'd think no other country ever would make any change to anything unless they either wanted to emulate or distance themselves from the us . 
  i 'd say there are still some differences though . 
  particularly , we played basketball in school ( none of the other ones were even featured ) , and during the last years where we had elective sport courses , there were always basketball courses . 
  some of the boys ( the ones who did n't play football ) played in local clubs that were in competitive leagues too . 
  but then of course there were other `` other sports '' about as popular as basketball , such as handball or hockey . 
  by the way , op , if in germany someone talks about `` hockey '' without any additional qualifier , it 's assumed they talk about field hockey , not ice hockey . 
  still , i 'd say out of the sports op named , basketball is the only one where i suspect most germans can name one german player : dirk nowitzki . 
  the majority would probably have trouble to name * any * player of american football , ice hockey , or baseball , of any nationality . 
  also be prepared for germans correcting you when do something wrong . 
  i shall now demonstrate : your german is quite understandable , very nice !, 
  just one thing : if you can not type a '' \u00df '' , * do n't * replace it with a b because it looks a bit similar . 
  it 's a completely different letter . 
  imagine replacing every `` o '' in a sentence with a `` d '' because the dne dn ydur keybdard is brdken . 
  `` grob '' in particular is technically `` grob '' , which is `` rough , uncouth '' and a bunch of synonyms . 
  rather , it goes like this , replacing typical german letters with ones that actually have the same value : \u00df = ss \u00e4 = ae \u00f6 = oe \u00fc = ue so , it 's `` gross '' , not `` grob '' . 
  it would be a misspelling from a schoolchild writing by hand , but in a situation where you do n't have the '' \u00df '' available , such as urls , it 's the accepted alternative . 
  in the `` most hated '' category , red bull ... erm , i mean `` rasenballsport '' leipzig is giving them a run for their money though . 
  because it was a very fun post , [ here ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/5in4a1/i_just_realized_if_tuition_is_free_from_german/ ) is a vintage post by an american who thought they 'd found the way to perpetual `` free college '' plus perpetual deferment of us student loans by taking free online courses from german universities . 
  tl ; dr : there are none of those . 
  `` normal '' german universities require you to be there physically . 
  there are some universities that offer correspondence courses , though only one of them has a really good reputation . 
  however , that university 1 ) teaches exclusively in german , 2 ) still requires you to be there for exams and occasional weekend courses , and 3 ) charges money . 
  well , if we go into that , i actually call them kreppel ( unless i have to buy them in shops where i live now , where that would not produce a result ) . 
  particularly not berliners , as they actually call the item in question a `` pfannkuchen '' ( weirdos ) . 
  really , i suspect that the few germans who actually know that he supposedly made a big , hilarious mistake found that out from americans on the internet . 
  yes , doing the numbers on that with a meter would be a nightmare . 
  hm , i think taxis here have to use meters , although the concept of drivers just telling you an amount has charm !, 
  tipping in taxis is n't totally necessary here , but for instance a taxi drive i regularly did in my last place of living ( train station -  home at night if i was a bit tipsy , or the weather was lousy ) was 5,50 , so paying 6 was what i did . 
  i sometimes get tips ( i 'm a musician , and when i do freelancing things outside my fixed job that people pay extra for , some like to round up to show appreciation ) , and it 's always nice to have a bit extra in the envelope i did n't count on . 
  so when i 'm in the situation to do so and the service warrants it , i tip people in positions where tipping is customary , too . 
  haha , when i went to ireland some years back with a friend , she * totally * over-tipped a taxi driver ( here in germany , you 'd tip somewhere around 5-10 percent , normally rounding up ) . 
  i think she must have tipped a third or so . 
  the man actually was puzzled , and i must have given her quite a confused look , but really she was just a bit flummoxed by the english language and the accent and everything . 
  i hope the driver had some beers on us after his shift ended . 
  no need - it 's just that your posts makes it sound as if tipping is some grand us invention , when in fact it 's 1 ) an old tradition at least in some european countries , and 2 ) the way it 's done in the us , from the point of view of many here , a consequence of lousy treatment of workers . 
  it 's not `` catching on '' here - it has been customary in many areas for a long time . 
  the difference is just that * tips are n't required for servers ( or any of the other groups that are often tipped ) to make a living * . 
  as there 's no chance that wages here are ever going to fall so low that waiters are n't paid any more by their employers , but rather directly by customers , i strongly doubt we 'll ever go the us way . 
  and that 's a good thing . 
  as the other commenter said , the concept of being `` a good tipper '' because you tip ... what it is it in the us , 20 percent ? 
  does n't exist . 
  here , it 's perfectly acceptable and sufficient to round up in a restaurant so the tip is something in the 5-10 percent range . 
  i usually do that , but i see no need to give more . 
  i think most people who watch do so `` ironically '' . 
  everything by loriot . 
  come on , say that you mean they 're `` brown '' . 
  did they also ask what percentage of them are european ? 
  that would be quite interesting to see as well . 
  well , the person who was asking about the slums was n't from the `` western world '' , iirc , and it seems also that these things are a lot rarer in places like canada and the us . 
  germany has a related term too , alternative to the `` schrebergarten '' one : an entire compound of them is called a `` kleingartenkolonie '' , that is a colony of small gardens . 
  you 're welcome !, 
  it 's funny , those really puzzle people from countries who have nothing comparable . 
  i remember someone in / r/germany a while back who 'd seen them in passing from a fast train and , coming from a country where such things exist , was wondering if it could be a slum settlement . 
  yes , and particularly at the time of their foundation , people living in rather cramped and bad conditions . 
  they 're an urban feature . 
  in the country , if you really want something with a garden , even it 's `` only '' a flat , you can find it , and there 's lots of greenery around anyway . 
  for instance , the house i recently moved into has three big flats stacked on top of each other . 
  as i have the ground floor flat , i have use of the garden ( with bigger plots , that is sometimes shared between all the parties ) . 
  the others can still look at all the gardens out the window though , they 've a balcony each , and one of the berry bushes belongs to the neighbour above me . 
  she also does the front flowerbed , which suits me fine , as she 's all about making things `` presentable '' , while i 'm all about having a natural garden with birds and butterflies . 
  the term `` community garden '' seems to be applied to some sort of communal gardening on the same plot of land , and that 's very much not what happens there . 
  depending on local rules , those are people who fine each other over someone having the wrong kind of plant in their border hedge , or letting said hedge grow 2cm too tall . 
  speak for yourself . 
  i do n't find my existence racist at all . 
  it 's what we call schreberg\u00e4rten : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allotment_ ( gardening ) #germany, 
  well , not `` community '' as such - they 're individual , rented plots , about which people are quite proprietary . 
  seriously though , the glass used , including the size , depends on the type of beer . 
  for instance , k\u00f6lsch ( yes , yes , i know i 'm going to get people who claim that it is n't real beer , move on ) is served in very narrow [ glasses ] ( http://static7.depositphotos.com/1241729/772/i/950/depositphotos_7724325-klsch-glas.jpg ) that contain 0.2 l. 
  the glass is sometimes called a `` stange '' , that is `` pole '' . 
  the reason why a small pole is better than larger glasses is that k\u00f6lsch has a low co ^ 2 content . 
  it grows stale and loses its foam as soon as it 's drawn , therefore the smaller the surface exposed to the air , the better . 
  also , in a traditional cologne pub you do n't need to order a k\u00f6lsch . 
  the `` k\u00f6bes '' , that is the waiter , goes round with a [ `` wreath '' ] ( http://www.brauer-bund.de/download/archiv/sorten/00288_d.jpg ) and puts one before you . 
  you have to say if you want something else ( and be prepared for some verbal abuse if it 's something he considers silly ) . 
  you also have to signal if you do n't want an empty glass replaced with a full one by default . 
  * a * folding rule . 
  it 's an object named `` folding rule '' , quite superiour to a 30-inch ruler or the equivalent ruler with a cm scale , at least for anything longer than said ruler . 
  and if you want to measure the * exact * size ? 
  say , you need to buy some sort of floor covering , or you want to rent/sell a place and therefore need precise numbers ? 
   in america alot of times we use cm and mm if we need to measure something smaller than an inch precisly so , in those cases the metric system is actually superiour ? 
  you 're contradicting yourself a bit . 
  how do you measure the size of a big room ?
