  it 's just that there is no culture of 1 ) everyone having to have one , 2 ) their ownership being a human right , or 3 ) needing them for self-defense . 
  even the gun-owners i know find , say , us attitudes to firearms bizarre . 
  what 's your definition of `` better '' here ? 
  aww , thanks !, 
  all that procrastination i 'm doing right now is good for something at least !, 
  the german one is very clickbaity , and when they talk about german customs etc. , often factually wrong . 
  it 's because t_d has a narrative of `` white people good , brown/black/muslim people bad '' going . 
  on some groups such as jews they 're a bit undecided , but leaning towards `` globalist elite controlling the banks '' . 
  t_d has a rather simplified idea of most countries , the population of which they consider far too stupid to see that they 're , say , being run by incompetent politicians or alternatively evil masterminds fostering white genocide . 
  their ideas can usually be summarised in very short sentences , i.e. 
  mention sweden and they reply with `` rape statistics !!!! '', 
  ( which are very high in sweden * because sweden compiles their statistics differently * ) . 
  in / r/germany , after the events on new year 2016 , we were heavily brigaded by them and other rightwingers for months . 
  the so-called `` alt-right '' is working on controlling the narrative in many of the big subs , which is why you can find horribly racist comments in just about anything that reaches the main page . 
  / r/germany though is one place where the sub 's population has n't let them get away with it , and the mods actually mod things like holocaust denial . 
  for a while though you could ask about `` where to get [ pork dish xy ] ? '', 
  in / r/germany , and you 'd be guaranteed to get at least one reply along the lines of `` pork will be banned in germany soon anyway ! '', 
  right . 
  in that case ... 
  i 'm a single woman . 
  there have been zero changes to my life , the level of threat i feel , the amounts of crimes i 've been a victim of ( zero since the refugees came , in the years before that two bicycle thefts and a car breakin , plus an exhibitionist years ago ) . 
  i frequently travel alone , including at night , and i spent several days and nights in cologne on my own in december . 
  if you mention that city in t_d , they will tell you it is a no-go-zone . 
  people i know personally who 've been victims of a violent crime : my cousin , who was raped by her first boyfriend ( who was a white german boy with no migration background ) , and did n't tell anyone for years . 
  and i suppose i and all my female schoolmates from around eighth year were victims of our sports teacher , who liked to ogle us under the shower and touch girls during gymnastics exercises . 
  the school was informed of these things and did nothing . 
  which is why i like to mention them to people who pretend that germany was some sort of paradise for women without sexual abuse and rape before all those refugees arrived . 
  by the way , some of the most anti-refugee politicians we have * also * voted against criminalising rape within the marriage , which happened in the 1990s . 
  that 's it . 
  i know no one who was a victim of a `` criminal refugee '' or whatever . 
  hm , there 've been so many people from t_d in / r/germany who were just `` asking for information/experience '' and got really nasty when we did n't tell them what they wanted to hear that i find it hard to assume good faith any more . 
  it 's rather more likely that this post here is just bait , so you can go back to t_d and crow about how deeply in denial we are when we tell you that , no , this country is still vastly safer than the us . 
  the most dangerous thing citizens here do is participate in traffic - which afaik is * also * safer than the us . 
  if you 're `` terrified '' , you probably ca n't handle living in a foreign country anyway . 
  hm , that rings a vague bell , but i 'd suspect it to be regional , i.e. 
  from the northern areas where there are harbours/sailors and their relatives . 
   pj\u00e4tt / kull/tage ( and a bunch of regional names for essentially the game of tag ) that 's funny - here in germany , too , this game is one that has a great variety in names between dialects . 
  there 's an atlas here where linguists map certain dialect words , and the [ map ] ( http://www.atlas-alltagssprache.de/fangen-spiel/ ) is one of the more colourful ones . 
  we have some of the widespread ones , like black cats etc. , but one that i think surprises foreigners is about clinking classes . 
  when you do that , it 's absolutely mandatory to look the person whose glass you 're clinking into the eyes . 
  else you 're going to have seven years of bad sex . 
  there even used to be field handball ( played on a football-sized pitch ) ; for a while , there was a nationwide league for the sport here in germany . 
  technically ( and i know you know this , i 'm just being pedantic for the sake of the non-germans ) , the fees you cite are not `` tuition fees '' - they 're called `` social contributions '' or similar , paying for student services , the public transportation and so on . 
  they do not go into the university budgets . 
  and the `` average '' name for men , as in the most frequent first and last name , is ... thomas m\u00fcller . 
  people made an actual movie , [ `` wer ist thomas m\u00fcller '' ] ( http://www.wer-ist-thomas-mueller.de/ ) ( who is thomas m\u00fcller ) , reporting on the lives of some of them , including * that * thomas m\u00fcller . 
   i might be able to sleep knowing that i can move to europe if the going gets rough and not be ostracized . 
  ( in other words , this trip is feasable ) * that * has far less to do with what people here think about americans , and a lot more with whether you 'll be able to get a visa that allows you to . 
  permanently moving to europe is not easier for a us person than moving for the us is for a european . 
  in my country for instance , a whole concept was developed after 1945 for a military that * does not * just mindlessly fulfill orders , as we 've seen where that leads . 
  here 's the [ official english translation ] ( http://www.kommando.streitkraeftebasis.de/resource/resource/mzezntm4mmuzmzmymmuzmtm1mzmyztm2mzizmdmwmzazmdmwmzazmdy4njqzndm3nmu2ntmynjkymdiwmjaymdiw/zdv_10-1_englisch.pdf ) of the regulations governing that - the whole thing is so specific to my country that the wikipedia article on this has n't even been translated . 
  essentially , soldiers here are required to be `` citizens in uniform '' , and their superiours are required , in addition to a bunch of other things , to take care of their civic education . 
  that document also lays out the conditions under which soldiers are not only allowed , but required to ignore orders . 
   all of those who are saying you have to learn the language are just being negative , as if learning a new language is a bad thing . 
  note that except for the american , presumably all the other commenters told op about studying requirements in * what is to them a foreign language * , so that 's quite an accusation to make . 
  as op already asked about studying in english , it should certainly be pointed out when that is n't an option . 
  and as for duolingo ... granted , i only went through the german to english program in an afternoon out of interest , but if the english to [ insert european language ] programs are in any way similar , they 're definitely not enough to gain c1 or even b2 level , which here at least are mostly required . 
  [ as per your other post ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/5ts6ik/what_college_towns_like_closest_to_international/ ) , a good first step would be not to ( badly and in a `` clever '' way that does n't work ) try to circumvent our laws . 
  fair enough . 
  but still , you ca n't visit the `` most beautiful '' or `` most important '' or `` most famous '' places in two weeks anyway , so why not pick one area and really enjoy it rather than to tick off `` looked at big ben '' on a list and run on ? 
  mhm , i 'm currently debating whether i should spend two or three weeks in a small holiday house in denmark . 
  while , yes , i do plan on going to look at lots of things in the region , the thought of `` doing europe '' in two weeks is slightly horrifying . 
  the divisions in there seem way too large , though . 
  i can easily tell you if , say , someone is from frankfurt , the middle of hessen , or ( if they still speak dialect , which many do n't ) somewhere from rural nordhessen . 
  yep , from reading i can understand it too - but it takes me about as much brainpower and looking-at-it-from-the-side as if it was dutch . 
  and that i definitely can not understand clearly if it 's spoken . 
  why ? 
  we make other things . 
  for instance , germany makes highly specialised machines that are used in factories all over the planet to make other things . 
  you could equally ask if governments everywhere should subsidise billions to copy that industry . 
  did n't even have to click the link , knew which post it was . 
  its fame stretches far across reddit . 
  well , agreed on the glamour , but we did manage a bit of scandal with k\u00f6hler and wulff . 
   if you compared it to pre-2001 , then sure . 
  meh , the raf was a thing . 
  well , 500 years ago people in my country were just about to start a religious conflict that would go on for centuries , and just seven years from a civil war in which several hundred thousand people were about to get killed about issues such as religion , rights for peasants and so on . 
  there were rather too busy with each other to consider building a wall and making the ottoman empire pay for it . 
  apart from that , which `` country '' ? 
  there were oodles of states of all sizes . 
   and i did n't even know for sure until we got a dna test there you have it . 
  i 've never heard of a german doing a * dna test * to find out whether they were german . 
  that 's not a thing . 
  who ? 
  to be honest , apart from hiv , stds are n't far in the public consciousness here . 
  i 'm not sure , but i think i recall reading that our rates for many are a lot lower than in the us , probably because schools here actually have sex ed that talks about how to prevent them . 
  we do n't really go `` oh my god sex '' , at least not in my country . 
  and i 'm not `` freaked out about stds '' , it 's just that herpes is n't considered an std here as most people have it anyway , and not from sex - as i said i got it as a small child , presumably from another child . 
  it 's odd , yes . 
  i think i dimly recall getting the lip bubbles ( here we just call them that , or herpes , and it does n't really have the std association ) as a teenager once , and then some years back when i was totally stressed and otherwise sick and my body just took any chance it could get to show me i should take some time off . 
  otherwise , i do n't even think about it , and do n't see myself as carrying some horrible disease . 
  interesting cultural difference , i suppose . 
  i got one of the herpes-related diseases , stomatitis , as a small child , most * definitely * not from sex . 
  since then i 've had those small bubbles at my lips twice at the most . 
  put a salve on , they went away , the end . 
  i do n't go around thinking `` oh no , i have an std '' . 
  as you say , that idea seems to be a fairly american one . 
       based on all these comments it seems i was mistaken as seeing europe as a single culture . 
  i guess you could say i see the eu more like the us . 
  individual states under a larger government . 
  while that is a misconception many americans seem to have , it 's just that - a huge misconception .
