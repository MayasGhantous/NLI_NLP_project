  sure , you have regional differences in the us , but we have those within our own countries as well . 
  those differences , as well as the differences between countries , often go back many * centuries * . 
  i doubt you 'll find an english-language show on germany where german people call in to discuss , in english , their experience of living in germany . 
  what would be the point ? 
  we have our own language . 
  zero interest . 
  i tried to watch matches once or twice , and i had no idea what was going on or why i should care . 
  there are other sports that i do n't regularly watch that i can still appreciate , like both kinds of hockey or handball , hell , i can watch * curling * , but american football is plain odd . 
  the tv station that was showing the superbowl here went all-out in american-style ads for the `` biggest sport event in the universe !!!! '', 
  and that 's just ludicrous . 
  the biggest sports match on the planet is the world cup final every few year . 
  american football is a regional sport . 
  i also find the things i 've read about/seen that take place around the superbowl a bit weird . 
  there seems to be more emphasis on the patriotic displays , the ads , the music performances , than on what actually goes on during the match . 
  did that , did n't turn out well . 
  nationality is asked for on forms as it 's actually relevant to many issues , but i 've not in my life seen a form that asked me for my `` race '' . 
  if any forms of that nature were officially used , there would be a great outcry and huge public discussion . 
  i also expect that many people would either not know what to put there or fill it out wrong just to make a point . 
  `` race '' is also not that relevant when it comes to many issues . 
  polish people or russian-germans are `` white '' , and russian-germans are probably `` ethnically german '' , but that does n't mean they wo n't face problems because of their origin . 
  in other countries , italians are probably considered `` white '' , but i still remember from my childhood that there were people who were quite racist , using slurs and everything , towards italians who 'd come here as guest-workers or were their descendants . 
  as for `` race '' , that is not a concept that is considered up-to-date here at all , except by racists who 're so far into it that they do n't even go `` i 'm not a racist , but '' . 
  that whole `` white people are caucasian '' thing * at best * calls up 19th century `` racial theories '' , and at worst rather worse things . 
  it sounds to as if someone is going to start measuring heads next . 
  i know you asked about `` visually '' , but there 's also the * loudness * in public settings . 
  our police is run by the states too , but they do manage to gather statistics of that sort . 
  yup . 
  what with various hordes of mercenaries , other armies , plagues and assorted nastiness , there were whole villages completely depopulated and given up afterward . 
  not really , no . 
  you can say `` ich bin berliner '' or `` ich bin * ein * berliner '' , which adds emphasis . 
  and as others pointed out , in berlin the baked good in question is n't even called `` berliner '' . 
  really , it 's possible for an expression to mean multiple things . 
  for instance , if a newscast says `` der hamburger b\u00fcrgermeister '' ( the mayor of hamburg ) , no one is going to claim they said `` der hamburger-b\u00fcrgermeister '' ( the mayor of hamburgers ) . 
  the whole `` he said he 's a jelly donut , and everyone laughed at him ! '', 
  is an american fabrication . 
  whenever , before seeing that interpretation on the internet , i saw references to that line in germany , it was in a context of him stating his support for berlin , and berliners and west-germans being very touched and heartened by it . 
  the only thing that perhaps amused people was his rather absurdly american accent . 
  wow . 
  i literally do n't know what to say to that . 
  there 's also the fact that authorities in the us do n't seem to care one bit how many people are shot , even if it turns out that they were unarmed/not a threat/innocent bystanders/children in a house police were storming . 
  afaik they do n't even collect official statistics on shootings ? 
  here , every * bullet * police officers fire is accounted for , and every case of weapons used against a human being is automatically investigated afterward . 
  they also try to shoot to disable , which the american internet tells me is not something that can be done . 
  people had to prove they had n't been involved in nazi crimes , particularly if they worked in official jobs . 
  there were several categories of what level of involvement someone had had . 
  many were `` mitl\u00e4ufer '' , people who just `` ran with the crowd '' . 
  people who were suspected of taking part in nazi crimes tried to get what people called a `` persilschein '' ( `` persil '' is a washing detergent , schein meaning all kinds of vouchers ) . 
  in that , someone who was demonstrably not a nazi testified to their character/lack of criminality etc. 
  that led to situations like my grandfather , who was the local contact person for the allies because he was a local authority figure without nazi associations , being asked to fill out persilscheine by the same people who had previously bullied him up to threatening he 'd be shot for not being a nazi . 
  the whole process did n't really work well . 
  the americans gave up on it quite quickly once they focused more on posturing against the ussr , so many , many people just slipped through the cracks . 
  government officials or judges of all ranks who had taken part in persecuting others just remained in their comfortable government posts until they were pensioned off with nice pensions , while the people they had persecuted ( if they were even alive still ) often having to wait for decades until they were rehabilitated . 
  there were plenty of nazi schoolteachers and such after the war . 
  my mother had one in the 50s who 'd taught in a napola . 
  hartz iv is n't `` yay , free money '' , it 's intended to support people until they find a place in the labour market . 
  and for that , yes , society can expect their cooperation . 
  we have people like yourself here . 
  they try any trick to get out of doing anything , like intentionally showing up unwashed and smelling of alcohol at the job interviews they have to prove they went to . 
  they 're giving * everyone * on hartz iv a bad name , meaning being on it is quite stigmatising . 
  and most people who get it would really prefer not to , they just have for various reasons ( age , physical problems , being in a dying trade , living in a high-unemployment region ) little chance in the job market . 
  the conditions under hartz iv are very hard , such as what is paid and what is n't , especially for children . 
  people are under tight supervision and suddenly have to ask permission for all sorts of things . 
  for families who previously were living on a decent income , it can get very hard and demoralising . 
  and people of your sort from pure laziness take money from the system which could much better benefit those who actually need it . 
  the first time i learned that he supposedly said something funny was when i started to interact with americans on the internet . 
  this is a non-issue here . 
  `` berliner '' , just like `` hamburger '' or `` frankfurter '' can mean both a food item and an inhabitant of a city , and context tells you which is which . 
   unique not really . 
  we 've even been getting this one in country subs . 
  - `` two daft [ people ] , one thought . '', 
  from what i 've seen of it , thelocal just takes articles from wherever and translates them to english . 
  there 's a lot of clickbaiting and `` ten things about germany you never even guessed , click this image gallery to find out '' . 
  i 've seen inches on measuring tapes sometimes . 
  as for the pfund etc. , it may exist colloquially , but it 's i guess you 'd say `` metricised '' - it consists of 500g , not whatever it used to be way back ( unit size varied locally , what fun ) . 
   hockey i always find it funny to see people from other countries call ice hockey just `` hockey '' . 
  in germany , if someone talks about `` hockey '' rather than `` eishockey '' , they mean * field hockey * , which is the `` default '' . 
  there seems still to be a lot fo forced prostitution going on , mostly of foreign women . 
  also , very few prostitutes actually registered for taxes/the social system and so on . 
  both of which seem to go back to the fact that a law was made , but there are very few efforts for enforcing it . 
  [ here you go . 
  make sure you read the comments on the linked original post , as there are a lot of quite snarky londoners in there . 
  ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/shitamericanssay/comments/4h3toi/can_i_find_tropical_fruits_in_london_im_from_a/ ), 
   americans with german ancestry are likely to be somewhat culturally different from americans with italian ancestry , for example . 
  they will have very little understanding of what it means to be a modern german , though . 
  the ones we get in / r/germany tend to make that rather comically clear by asking about things like whether it 's a done thing in germany to have the crest of the german empire tattooed onto your body . 
  ( hint : it is really definitely not . ), 
  that is fine as far as it goes , but it gets rather irritating once they also claim that their `` heritage '' gives them expertise on modern germany . 
  `` gypsy enclaves '' are n't a thing here . 
  and in 2006 there were already areas inhabited by many turks etc. , but those are n't `` no-go zones '' . 
  at least all the ones i ever entered in places like cologne are n't . 
  and yes , [ in 2006 a former government spokesman talked about ] ( http://www.zeit.de/online/2006/20/nogoareas-heye ) how how there were `` small or mid-sized towns in brandenburg and elsewhere '' which he advised dark-skinned people not to enter , because `` they possibly would n't leave them alive '' . 
  and yes , that is how the term `` no-go zones '' was discussed here at length . 
  before calling other people 's statements about what happened in their own countries `` silly '' , it 's generally advisable to at least consider they might know what they are talking about . 
  did you follow german media in 2006 ? 
  i did . 
   does n't no-go area mostly refer to places with a lot of neonazis or other racists , where people of color may not want to go . 
  that 's how it first was part of public discourse here , i think , yes . 
  those types of commenters generally are . 
  having been to both france and the us ( speaking better english than french , sadly ) , i too found france a lot easier to understand . 
  sure ( apart from the language ) everything looked different somehow , but it was easier to grasp and get accustomed to than the differences to the us .
