  that 's the level of understanding they have of our culture . 
  they can put it where the sun does not shine . 
  i always have to correct that one , as my parents lived close to rotenburg at the time and routinely drove past the house etc. 
  our phone calls for quite a while afterward got a bit awkward when we were talking about meals , and someone mentioned sausages . 
  rotenburg ( an der fulda ) , not rothenburg ( ob der tauber ) , actually . 
  just in case someone goes to rothenburg , as tourists do , and thinks they 've been in the hometown of the famous cannibal . 
  many watch it `` ironically '' . 
  i do n't think most really care about the results one bit . 
  which would make it rather ironic - was n't ( and i do n't have that from a tv shows ) economic pressure , lack of farmland etc. 
  in the countries of origin a major reason for people becoming vikings and trying to settle elsewhere in the first place ? 
  have you ever been to norway - or really , to * any * foreign country ? 
  you should probably first evaluate your quite obvious tendency of imagining foreign places as some backwards yet charming idyllic clich\u00e9 . 
  do you seriously think that a modern industrialised country like norway would have places that are `` traditional based '' to a point of not having electricity or cars ? 
  how 's it with the drinking - have there been changes over time ? 
  when my classmates did military service in 2000 , there was still a lot of it going on from what they said . 
  but i know a retired oberstleutnant - i guess he must be out ten years or so - and he said that there was real pressure to crack down on excess alcohol use . 
  he told how he had to fine some poor sod who 'd gone to a laundry room or something with a can of beer and was all shocked when the oberstleutnant barged in on his drinking . 
  not op , but german - we definitely do n't have the `` thank you for your service '' reflex here towards soldiers . 
  i could own one . 
  however , note that * owning one * does not mean `` being allowed to carry it around '' . 
  people who do competitive shooting or hunting are allowed to carry their firearm , secured , to the shooting range or their hunting grounds . 
  they 're not allowed to carry it in the supermarket or for `` self defense '' . 
  people who are only collectors have to keep the firearm at home . 
  if you want a license to carry a firearm , open or concealed , you need to work in a job ( police/security guard ) where you actually need one . 
  and no , there has been no situation in my life when i wished i had been armed . 
  and i 'm a single woman living alone and going alone wherever i like at any time of day . 
  apprentice - lehrling journeyman - geselle master - meister guild - gilde ( not really used any more ) chamber - kammer ausbildung is roughly equivalent to apprenticeship ( i think technically you could say that all apprenticeships are an ausbildung , but not vice-versa ) . 
  azubi is `` auszubildender '' , someone who is doing an ausbildung . 
  all lehrline are azubis , but not vice-versa . 
  the apprentice/journeyman/master structure is used more in older jobs or ones related to manual crafts , not so much in office/retail etc. 
  environments . 
  it has nothing to do with `` unions '' . 
  it has to do with our education system , in which it 's considered worthwhile to have an educated , professionally qualified workforce on all levels ( with qualifications related to their actual work ) , rather than separating between `` no college degree '' / `` college degree , even if it 's a random bachelor bearing no relation to what a person actually does '' ( sorry if that is a bit too pointedly expressed ) . 
  there is n't really a concept here of `` entry level jobs '' that people take without having qualifications to then `` learn on the job '' and `` rise through the ranks '' - the `` learning on the job '' thing happens during apprenticeships , but is combined with schooling and results in a specific certificate . 
  there are chambers which control the opening , licensing etc. 
  of handicraft businesses , but they 're not `` unions '' as they consist of people running their own business , as well as the journeymen who work for them . 
  just like the apprenticeship system , this goes back essentially to the guild system in the middle ages . 
  it * is * possible to open businesses in some ( but not all ) craftsman branches without being a master of the craft . 
  but of course taxes , having to provide social insurances for the workers etc. 
  still apply . 
  and for serious work that has to be done by professionals , people tend to prefer true professional companies . 
  in the german apprenticeship system that covers most manual trades as well as office/service jobs or the likes ( almost everything that is not a university job ) , being a gardener is a skilled trade , and people running a gardening/landscaping company might be masters of the craft . 
  and hiring skilled craftsmen , even if they 're journeymen rather than masters , costs . 
  really depends on location . 
  in the old settled areas of villages the plots can be big enough to grow all the potatoes and vegetables a family needs over a year , if you use all available land . 
  in germany it 's not considered good behaviour to display that you 're `` doing well '' , at least if it 's `` doing better than the people living next to you '' . 
  i live in the ground floor of a house with three flats stacked on top of the other . 
  the garden is mine , both to care for and to use for growing things/enjoyment . 
  i have an arrangement with the man living in the flat above re : lawn care though . 
  it 's not getting mowed every week however . 
  i suspect even his wife , who 's somewhat compulsive re : cleaning and no leaf being out of line , would find that excessive . 
  you could n't even * park them * in most underground parking garages or on public parking lots in cities here - that is not `` versatile '' . 
  and of course gas consumption on the bigger ones would be downright bizarre . 
  my own country was separated by a deathly border , people on both sides were prepared for invasion by the other , and we would have been turned into a nuclear wasteland by our `` allies '' from either side . 
  also , of course , we were * nazis * 75 years back . 
  how 's that for an `` internal crisis '' ? 
  if the us civil war was a factor in `` trusting you '' , or not `` considering you savages '' , where would * we * be ? 
  how would we be dealing with our neighbours and allies , most of whom we attacked . 
  there are other reasons , especially right now , not to `` trust your leadership '' . 
  in conclusion : the us really are n't as special or exceptional as you 'd like to see yourselves . 
  another example is depression . 
  public reaction is markedly different for someone who is `` depressive '' compared to someone who has `` burnout '' . 
  while from what i 've read , many `` burnout '' cases are actually depression , `` depression '' is `` sitting around at home and wallowing in misery and laziness '' , while `` burnout '' is `` this person worked so much that they now need a good rest '' . 
  the thing is that `` refugees '' are n't a new phenomenon . 
  the ladies ( now over 90 ) that i 've met who came out of the east with nothing but what they could carry after wwii are `` refugees '' just as much as the two small syrian girls i met a while back , who could already speak very good german after a year here . 
  we 've had dictatorships from both sides in my country . 
  both were bad . 
  but one had a significantly higher death-toll than the other . 
  yes , that 's what i meant . 
  tipping is n't some sort of outlandish custom here which would flabbergast your server and which only americans do . 
  it 's just not something you absolutely * have * to do if you do n't want the server to starve , and not tipping is not quite the big gesture it would be in the us - i think you 're even supposed to tip if the service was bad ? 
  that would seem to defeat the point for me . 
  here , rounding up to something in the range between 5 or 10 percent in a restaurant is quite customary . 
  people also tip delivery drivers , hairdressers , taxi drivers , and hotel cleaners . 
  i 'm a musician , and people tip me on occasion - i charge my usual amount for a certain service , and find some extra money in the envelope afterward . 
  i do n't expect it , but it 's nice when it happens . 
  it 's not that i need that money desperately , it 's just a small gift like when people give flowers , chocolate , or a bottle of wine . 
  if that venezuelan 's `` 1/2 german ancestry '' means that one of their parents was german at the time of their birth , they 're a citizen and can do as they please . 
  if that `` 1/2 german ancestry '' means that half of their great-great-grandparents emigrated from germany , they 're venezuelan . 
  and as for the catholicism thing , as a protestant that 's a foreign culture for me , too . 
  also , catholicism is n't genetic . 
  * genetics * ? 
  you mean people roll up with one of those 23andme things and we say `` yay , you 're german !!! '' ? 
  and no , op , you can post as many times as you like , you wo n't get people here to agree that americans should get priority on immigration because the us are deteriorating . 
  list for us , please , the foreign languages you know , as well as your level of fluency for each . 
  i 've heard stories of acquaintances trying to do it , but ending up releasing the carp into the wild because it had become a pet within one day , and no one felt able to kill it . 
  believe me , we get people in / r/germany who think all germans are blond and blue-eyed , too . 
  they even use some of the same theories , like not capitalising names or the whole `` lieschen from the family of m\u00fcller , a sovereign human being '' lingo . 
   even the germans should be happy that they did n't win . 
  did you honestly think we are n't ? 
  ( apart from some few nazis ) that 's why that `` two world wars and one world cup '' thing is so silly - it only works as a taunt if the people hearing it are sad that they lost wwii . 
  i 'm sure everyone would be so much happier under a nazi-ruled greater germany covering all of europe . 
  after all , who cares about living in a system that persecutes just about everyone it encounters , as long as there 's `` unity '' . 
  / s at how many millions of dead would we be by now , i wonder ? 
  during my us exchange , we skipped over the border to look at the niagara falls . 
  i could definitely imagine going to canada again , with all the beautiful nature . 
  haha , no . 
  i knew the difference too , but my brain just decided to take the other word . 
  english : year 5-11 ( compulsive ) . 
  french : year 7-13 .
