  post it when you 're done ? 
  i 'm trying to see it in front of my mental eye , and ca n't quite make it work . 
  i 've heard about a few `` i did europe in a week '' type things , but this is absolutely bizarre . 
  when do you even want to spend that money ? 
   or would they take action by simply having more children ooh , i know . 
  we could give medals to women who have plenty of children for the fatherland . 
  * that one * has n't been tried bef ... oh , it has . 
  sorry to disappoint you , but i for one am not going to have children , should i decide to have any , for the reason of `` outbreeding '' , as foreigners `` concerned '' about us like to call it , brown people . 
  what 's really interesting about this is that i remember from my childhood how some people were quite xenophobic towards italians and greeks , and xenophobia towards polish people is perhaps even more recent . 
  `` native europeans '' are not the happy family of white people some foreign `` experts '' seem to think . 
  it 's a thing that is portrayed as a `` german tradition '' in the us , hanging a pickle-shaped ornament in their christmas trees . 
  which , as your question marks indicate , is not a german thing . 
  perhaps if you find an international company in the us that deploys to abroad ... but even then , in order to negotiate with people , you will obviously need to know local laws and the language . 
  i 'm honestly curious - as an educated person , how had you thought this immigration thing would work for you ? 
  in european monarchies , spouses inheriting crowns is n't a thing . 
  it 's either the eldest child , or the eldest son , depending on how they do it , and then on to more remote relatives - but relatives of the king/queen , not of their spouse . 
  can i , as a german , simply move to the us without any special , sought-after qualifications ? 
  the answer to that tells you something about how it works in reverse . 
  and no , being american in itself is not a special qualification , and `` i 'm a native speaker , so i can teach english '' is not a job skill . 
  haha , no . 
  `` my ancestors emigrated from [ german town i ca n't spell ] to the us in the 19th century , and we always hang a pickle in the christmas tree '' does n't give you anything . 
  the * only * thing in germany that is vaguely like that is people who were stripped of their citizenship under their nazis being able to reclaim it , at which point they can obviously move here . 
  and if you have very recent german ancestors , i.e. 
  your mother , things are different too . 
  but what us people think of as `` ancestry '' is generally far too remote . 
  in my parents ' household ( and yes , my parents are educated , this is n't a `` class '' thing or them not knowing other words ) , low-level profanity has always been a thing . 
  my father not so much , but my mother does n't blink at `` schei\u00dfe '' , `` mist '' , `` arschloch '' , `` verdammt '' . 
  there are other , cruder terms though that i 've never heard there , or even said myself in my life . 
  and with the lower-level profanity it was always clear that there are words you do n't use when talking to strangers or grandmothers . 
  my one grandmother even considered `` hallo '' vulgar and preferred `` guten tag '' , `` good day '' , and you can be * sure * that once i 'd figured that out , i always said `` hallo '' . 
  she was an awful old woman . 
  good grief . 
  people in / r/germany have been giving you some good answers already - if you redefine your terms to be as wide as possible , you can `` win '' any argument . 
  so i 'll just add that my own litmus test of something being `` banned '' , which i think is not entirely unreasonable , is `` we possess a historic copy of that book , would be be in any legal trouble or even just have it confiscated if we mentioned that to a police officer ? '', 
  to which the answer is , and has been , no . 
  i mean , i quoted from the damn thing in a school paper in the mid-90s , a quote which was * not * in our school books , giving a full citation of what edition i had been using , and the history teacher did * not * start an investigation regarding how i 'd gotten that quote . 
  also , wow . 
  i 've had spirited discussions with friends about the veracity of this or that , but if either of us published a blog post about it dripping with smugness and personal references like your `` buddy 's '' , we 'd re-examine that friendship . 
  * again * ? 
  do n't you get bored ? 
  those are done here too , and the grandparents of a friend almost fell for it . 
  these people are incredibly clever in how they direct conversations and make people themselves give them hints on what to tell them , it 's scary . 
  the targets are people with `` old-sounding '' first names ; there 's also a segment that 's specialised in targeting `` russian-germans '' , that is people who recently came to germany from countries in the east due to german ancestry . 
  some of the old people do n't speak german well , and they have little familiarity with how the justice system works here . 
  so a phone call in which their grandson needs several thousand euro to pay to the police after an accident might pass as `` well , if that 's how things are done in germany , we have to pay '' . 
  what ? 
  someone from the leadership of the berlin pirate party seems to have murdered his boyfriend and then committed suicide ; there are indications that he was mentally ill . 
  politicians do n't generally run around murdering each other here , for political reasons at least - there is no conspiracy theory about this that i know of . 
  in germany , i associate it with munich `` high society '' ( i.e. 
  people trying to be posh who are n't ) . 
  i hug my friends , but cheek kisses would be * weird * . 
  but this is a question of * fact * , not opinion , and answers can be sourced and everything . 
  if you were to get `` different responses '' , the people giving them would n't be in possession of another truth , they 'd either be mistaken or lying . 
  i `` care lol '' because it is rather tiresome to have foreigners , usually us people , coming into our sub with supposedly innocent questions about our country , and then * refuse to accept what we tell them * because they had wanted a different answer . 
  do you honestly not see how disrespectful that is ? 
  would you like people repeatedly coming into subs dedicated to your country doing that ? 
   also you can always choose between different `` third '' languages ( beside german and english ) like russian , french , latin , spanish , greek ... well , `` always '' depending on your school . 
  mine offered exactly three foreign languages . 
  and accounting , economics or informatics were n't taught either . 
  well , americans coming into / r/germany about free university like to talk about these , and as op already mentioned one , i thought i 'd address the others too . 
  * why * , though ? 
  every single person in / r/germany told you the same thing . 
  do you think we were all lying ? 
  in germany , `` work experience '' , `` leadership skills '' , `` motivational essays '' etc. 
  are mostly irrelevant ( `` work experience '' in particular , except for some very specific german issues involving qualifications you wo n't have either ) . 
  previous university degrees are what you need . 
  even if you find a program in english that you 're qualified for ( and a philosophy ma wo n't get you into with things unrelated to philosophy ) , you 'll generally need to prove german proficiency . 
  and courses in the humanities are usually taught in german , what with the rather large corpus of , well , german-language things to tackle there . 
  not most of germany . 
  nowadays , i do n't think many people even know what the traditional dress of their area even looks like . 
  people themselves did too . 
  both my sets of grandparents were given the default copy at the registrar 's office when they married ; one of those copies ended up on the midden after the war . 
  the court , police and so on shows ~ ~ that i might or might not be watching when doing mindless stuff around the house ~ ~ are on sat1 . 
  i think the one with the teenagers is on vox , yes . 
  i only ever saw that while switching channels , and it was in a wholly different category of bad . 
  too sweet . 
  even with baking recipes , the default first step is to adjust them so they are n't that damn sweet . 
  nice answer , but you could have saved the time . 
  we went over this * excessively * in / r/germany . 
  op kept saying that his `` friends '' do n't believe him that it has never been banned , even with sources , but i 'm starting to think there are no friends involved . 
  oh , i think there 's a hospital one too , and one with emergency services ... 
  i guess the services in question see it as a sort of public education campaign and therefore take part . 
  sure , that too . 
  i mean , those people playing all the roles probably get free catering and a few euros . 
  i rather marvel that so many people volunteer for that sort of thing . 
  all those very scripted `` reality shows '' . 
  i think there are some about the supposed lives of teenagers that are really bad , and there are oodles of court/police/detective / lawyer shows that are scripted and ( apart from the main roles which are taken by real lawyers/police officers/detectives ) played by really , really bad amateurs . 
  of course they 're on tv because people watch them . 
  i myself have some guilty pleasure in watching people acting bad stereotypes ( `` teacher '' / `` pastor '' / `` rich person '' / `` pimp '' ) in the `` court shows '' , and trying to guess from the seemingly unimportant details included in the setup who actually committed the crime . 
  ( because in those shows there are always surprise revelations in the courtroom . 
  i 've read that when those shows started , real life courts actually started to have trouble with people from the audience shouting into the proceedings , which happens quite frequently in those shows but is not the normal standard of a german court . ), 
  aah , thanks , i knew there was something like that . 
  terry pratchett seems to have had some inspiration there . 
  not our war , but did n't some country go to war over someone 's ear ( ca n't remember the circumstances ) ? 
  i mean , i can understand that the person who lost it had previously been very attached to it , but a whole war over that sort of thing ? 
  yes , that came through in the article i linked too . 
  it also seemed as if prison management , not any agency of the justice system , determined if people were released early and so on . 
  on the other hand , in the prison the reporter visited , things like prisoners stabbing each other were n't treated as , you know , new crimes . 
  rather people just lost credits for good behaviour , or were put into solitary confinement . 
  where i live , that sort of thing gets people a new trial .
