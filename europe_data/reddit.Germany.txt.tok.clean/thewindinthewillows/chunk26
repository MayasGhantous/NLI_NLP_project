  in german schools , we no longer make children `` play soldiers '' , because we have seen what that can be used for and where it can lead ( by the way , teaching `` leadership skills '' by letting children `` lead '' slightly younger children was a big thing then too ) . 
  our society also does n't have any kind of military worship , for lack of a better word , such as `` thanking people for their service '' , discount for soldiers , or thinking that `` the military is unique '' . 
  i 'm not saying you 're a member of the hitler youth , but i 'm trying to explain why for most europeans what you 're describing is incredibly bizarre . 
  and the fact that you do n't seem to see that but rather minimise the militarisation effect does n't mean it 's actually harmless , it just means that it works really well . 
   i mean , it 's really just another high school class . 
   also , it 's not paramilitary because , in the grand scope of things , we 're really just sort of playing marines . 
  and the fact that this is how you view these activities shows how well the indoctrination is working . 
  as you see , in hardly any place in europe would that sort of thing be `` just another high school class '' . 
  in my country , no one would even bring up the idea of doing something like that . 
  we had something like that , though the abbreviation was shorter , and it did n't end well . 
  and i have to say that from an outsider 's perspective your description of this very military-sounding program with all the military elements and the `` building esprit de corps and patriotism '' part , while simultaneously insisting that it 's not a military program , is either scary or hilarious or possibly both . 
  [ much of the rural east , and parts of the rural west ] ( https://www.immobilienscout24.de/immobilienbewertung/immobilienpreise.htm ) - the map gives rental prices for flats in euro per square meters . 
  of course there are reasons why it 's cheap there - anyone who possibly can ( mostly educated people who can find jobs elsewhere and afford to move ) is moving away from the * really * rural places . 
  yup . 
  i 'm sure that i 'm far from the only person who has never driven one . 
  in fact , besides taxis , i 've only ever been in one car ( belonging to an old man ) that had an automatic . 
  i 've never heard anyone say `` herr/frau professor '' - that seems too subservient and outdated . 
  as for using the title at all , usually one makes a pro-forma attempt at `` herr/frau professor x '' the first time , but once it becomes clear that that particular professor does n't need their ego stroked by constantly being reminded they are one ( good professors do n't need that ) , it 's just `` herr/frau x '' . 
  in germany , too - it 's not solely a language matter but very much a cultural one . 
  the only of the things the other commenter quoted that we do here too would be `` herr professor schmidt '' - but * not * for school teachers , just university professors who went through the whole doctorate + habilitation thing . 
  it 's a common stereotype here that austrians * love * titles , everyone 's a geheimrat there . 
  i 'd * like * to see disdain and derision . 
  however that is not something they can do , the world simply does not work like that . 
  i would hope and settle for them not bending over for everything the us do even if it violates our own laws and rights . 
  as i do n't think he 's the type who can handle complex and subtle negotiations , i think other leaders should gang up on him . 
  but i 'm not holding my breath . 
  not just the police , the press did its part too by deciding to call them `` d\u00f6ner murders '' and following the police line that it was organised crime . 
  that made things even more horrible for the victims ' families , who had to defend themselves and their lost ones from suspicions of being criminals . 
  i remember very few days where it was actually cancelled , and yes , definitely due to road conditions . 
  during winter , we always had the big hope waiting at the bus stop in the morning that the school bus might not come , at which point we would have gone home again . 
  and i recall them sending us home early once . 
  we made it back to our village all right ( we could go along the river , on the grass etc. 
  ) , but in the village i was utterly lost because i could n't get up the damn hill our street was on . 
  i was just trying to get from lantern to doorpost to fence somehow when my father came down and rescued me , having heard that we 'd been sent home and wondering where i was . 
  in my school they measured the temperatures in the well-shaded office of the principal . 
  guess which rooms were not shaded ? 
  the classrooms . 
  the whole `` german sounds angry ! '', 
  nonsense seems to come from people watching hitler speeches , really . 
  [ mark twain ] ( https://www.cs.utah.edu/~gback/awfgrmlg.html ) still chided the language for being too soft and gentle ( among many other things ) . 
  but yes , if you exclusively choose material from someone whose whole mode of communication is angry shouting in an absolutely weird accent , of course it will sound angry !, 
  they conquered the rest of italy too though , there were wars between rome and the other tribes and everything . 
  so by that logic , the only people the question would apply to would be people from the original rome . 
  yep . 
  i know people who do own firearms , including a retired high-ranking military officer . 
  none of them think that us-style `` needing a gun on me for self defense '' ideas are sane . 
  are you constantly wearing a builder 's helmet too ? 
  because you never know when something will fall from a building facade or a room ceiling . 
  ireland . 
  gorgeous landscape , various old monuments , nice towns and villages , and very friendly people . 
  ah , really ? 
  i was under the impression , especially judging by people complaining about cash in / r/germany , that americans for instance pay everything with credit cards . 
  for me it 's the other way round . 
  debit cards , fine , if i have to ... but using * credit cards * for buying daily necessities ? 
  no thanks . 
   never seen a bagger in europe , the mere idea seems very weird to me . 
  when walmart tried to conquer the german market , one of the things they introduced that really weirded people out were `` baggers '' . 
  it 's funny really , when one discusses the idea with people here , the usual reaction is `` but as soon as the cashier scanned them , those are * my * things , no one touches them ! '', 
  contrary to how i guess op experienced it from what they 're used to , for us `` baggers '' are a weird intrusion , not `` customer service '' . 
  well , he 's a german citizen , was born and grew up here , speaks accent-free german , went through the germany school system , and decided to play for germany . 
  what more do you want ? 
  in case you 're american , are you actually american , that is native ? 
  in my country for one , we do n't ask people to prove aryanhood any more , sorry . 
  you might be able to find statistics about recent immigration background , but you wo n't find anything about people being `` caucasian '' ( wtf is that even about , i 'm not from the caucasus ) . 
  [ these men ] ( http://www.bz-berlin.de/data/uploads/2016/06/mannschaft_1464987014.jpg ) are all german , and by extension european . 
  yes , even the one in the top left corner , before you ask . 
  they genuinely seem to have thought that the american way was so superiour that we 'd only need to see it to love it . 
  they also had * real * trouble with the idea that our workers ' protection laws are actually enforced . 
  and some of the stuff they did was just cringy , like making workers perform their morning motivational shouts . 
  that 's so against the german character , as well as against what people consider appropriate for an employer to demand from them ... amazing . 
  there was a walmart near the flat where i first lived alone , and i went occasionally because it was the biggest supermarket . 
  by the time , the us superficialities were n't done there any more , so it just was a large , badly organised warehouse with shouty signs and huge packages of bad products . 
  that , too , was something they did n't seem to understand : germans do n't really go in for huge `` fill the whole car with bags '' shopping trips ( any more ? 
  i think i used to see people with piled carts more often in the past ) . 
  as a single person , my usual grocery haul is 35 euros or so . 
  i do n't buy the cheapest things or anything , i just go several times a week . 
  no need for 60 rolls of toilet paper in one pack on the german market !, 
  i think macdonald adapted here , too . 
  a while back they started to really emphasise the origin of their ingredients etc. , trying to make people believe they were good-quality , hah . 
  of course they did n't have quite the competition they 'd have in the netherlands - food vendors here had done chips before , but they 're not as widespread and important as in the netherlands , i 'd say . 
  scroll down a bit in the / r/germany [ faq ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/wiki/faq ) for some suggestions . 
  mind , not much of it sounds like health food . 
  yep , for the whole eu . 
  the same is true for sending things to the us . 
  same in germany . 
  in germany , we do n't really go into shops to have a `` shopping experience '' . 
  we want to be able to find what we need quickly , with the product in good quality and reasonably-priced . 
  it 's quite ok if interaction with employees is kept to a minimum . 
  a great example is how walmart fared when they thought they 'd introduce us to the joys of us-style shopping . 
  they failed for a number of reasons ( running up against our labour rights , using americans to source products who had n't the slightest idea about what germans buy , the high point being them buying huge amounts of pillowcases that they could n't sell because * germans use different pillows than americans * ) . 
  but anyway , the us-style `` shopping experience '' did n't go over well at all . 
  they had `` greeters '' , which weirded people out . 
  then , the cashiers were made to smile at people ; male customers thought they were flirting . 
  that does n't mean that germans are always rude , but german politeness can be done with a neutral face , not with manic smiling . 
  and then they had `` baggers '' , but people really disliked others touching their groceries after they had paid . 
  walmart must have thought that germans would be enchanted by all the great service , but germans just felt it was intrusive . 
  now , i realise that i 've done a us-germany comparison more than talking about how we see things , but i guess it might give you some hints . 
  and it lines up with my feelings as well . 
  i do n't , say , need a cashier or waiter to make fake-personal conversation with me , when we both know that they 're just doing their job and have been ordered to `` be nice '' . 
  as long as they do their job well and we have the same level of polite interaction i 'd have with any stranger , it 's all good .
