  you 'll probably not be able to get a fresh bread roll or an icecream or similar items sold in non-supermarket shops in most places . 
  that 's not citizenship though . 
  pretty much none of those 50 million self reported `` german-americans '' for instance have citizenship . 
  edit : ah , never mind , just saw that there is some citizenship information in that table . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://www.bpb.de/gesellschaft/migration/kurzdossiers/160471/auslandsdeutsche ) , it 's very hard to track how many german citizens live abroad . 
  the number appears to be at least a million , possibly up to 3.4 million . 
  you think we do n't have that here ? 
  when neighbouring cities play against each other in football , they need huge police forces because there 's no better venue for a bunch of drunk young men to fight out their long-cultivated hatreds for people who 're just like them , but have the bad taste of living a few kilometers down the autobahn . 
  and that 's cities * in the same state * . 
   that 's amsterdam , and brothels are not a thing , we have cabins where women by their own choice can sell sex . 
  there are strict rules about that in place . 
  also , you want to travel and you want to go to a brothel ? 
  seriously ? 
  you should see / r/germany . 
  we regularly get questions about brothels etc. 
  and yesterday we had someone who had found a post about erection problems on a relationship forum and wanted us to diagnose what precisely the man who was mentioned there ( his girlfriend had posted , not himself ) was and was n't able to do with sex . 
  when the post was removed , i got a pm insisting i diagnosed the man 's erection issues . 
  as for this op , i love how `` girls '' are a commodity . 
  i would n't eat it , but that 's due to culture . 
  in the end , assuming that all animals had been treated well while alive and slaughtered in the most humane way possible , there 's simply no reason why eating cows and pigs are ok , while eating dogs is horrible , except that in our culture dogs are pets and not meat animals . 
  there 's something similar to it here , actually . 
  in some regions of my country as well as neighbouring ones , horse meat has traditionally been eaten , but many who eat other animals without issues would never touch it . 
  yes , my car radio is very insistent on telling me . 
  we do n't actually eat much sauerkraut . 
  average consumption per person and year is one kilo . 
  if the current ikea radio ad for tomato plants is n't lying , we eat 22 kilos of tomatoes in the same time period . 
   european language i speak a european language ( well , three ) , so that means i can speak all the others ? 
  grand . 
  also , supposedly that krampus thing is typical for germany when it ( he ? 
  i 'm not even quite sure what it is ) is practically unknown in most of the country . 
  ah well , if speaking fails totally , i can probably still manage `` jeg taler ikke dansk '' , and i hope i 'll be able to read things by coming at them from both german and english and knowing a little grammar . 
  i always feel weird abroad if i do n't know at least a little of the language . 
  i 'm german , actually . 
  but that probably does n't make it better , i suspect ? 
  there 's one in `` br\u00f8d '' , i think ? 
  i 've been trying to do it , but i 'm sure i ca n't do it right !, 
  aww . 
  i 'll still be able to read signs and things though !, 
  depends on the situation . 
  if you 're stopped by police in germany ( rather than just getting a parking ticket or being caught by a speeding camera ) for a high enough fine , they make foreigners pay at once before they 're allowed to drive on . 
  i guess they know why they 're doing that . 
  danish . 
  going to travel there in autumn , want to be able to at least be polite . 
  i 'm starting by using duolingo ( i 'm on a 65-day streak now ) , but i also have a classic book with exercises and several cds , as i know i really need more structure at some point . 
  sadly there are no rl courses within a realistic distance . 
  if we take the aspect of `` being in a hidden place waiting to come back in some far future and to rule again '' , it has to be friedrich barbarossa . 
  he 's sitting in the kyffh\u00e4user , waiting for his beard to grow around a stone table . 
  in switzerland perhaps ? 
  i have n't heard it in germany for many years . 
  oh yes , i remember the one about the `` fernsehturm '' , where people discussed in epical width what is the difference between a funkturm and a fernsehturm . 
  i 'm more pedantic and convinced of the rightness of my opinions than most people , i fear , but even i know that at some point you just have to * let it go * . 
  i do n't know the precise history , it 's just something that grew to be used less and less because women did n't like it any more . 
  i was born in 1981 ; when i was in elementary school , there were still two or three old women in our village who * insisted * on fr\u00e4ulein because it was very important to them for some reason that they were unmarried . 
  we even had two neighbours , sisters , both unmarried . 
  one , the one who had the command over the household , was `` frau lastname '' , the other was `` fr\u00e4ulein lastname '' . 
  some interesting implications there . 
  some very few old people also addressed me and my age mates as `` fr\u00e4ulein '' when we grew to very young adulthood . 
  apart from that , i 've been `` frau '' my entire life . 
  the implications of `` fr\u00e4ulein '' are problematic for several reasons : there is no distinction in address between married and unmarried men . 
  yet a woman would be required to disclose her marital status whenever she met a new person . 
  also , `` fr\u00e4ulein '' literally means `` little woman '' , it 's the diminutive of `` frau '' . 
  so a woman is not a full-grown woman until she 's married . 
  again , no such distinction is made for men . 
  `` fr\u00e4ulein '' is now used in certain pop culture contexts , `` ironically '' . 
  apart from that , it really only appears when someone is scolding/winding up a young girl , as in `` fr\u00e4ulein , you 're not going to get any ice cream until you 've tidied up your room '' . 
  for germany , yes . 
  you say `` entschuldigung '' , or you catch their eye and slightly lift your hand ( subtly , no waving or beckoning or anything , just a slight lift ) . 
  they 're on the lookout for that . 
  not an `` inconsistency '' as such , but there is a mindbogglingly long discussion on the [ discussion page for the `` fr\u00e4ulein '' article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/talk:fr%c3%a4ulein ) . 
  someone ( plus several sockpuppets ) who claims to have lived in germany yet can not spell even the simple word `` frau '' is totally convinced that `` fr\u00e4ulein '' is not in fact obsolete and fallen out of use but that this is merely some feminist conspiracy . 
  they claim that `` educated members of german society and those concerned with proper etiquette '' are in fact still using it constantly . 
  i am totally unable to comprehend why someone would * care * that much about something like that enough to make sockpuppets and invent work experience in germany and whatever , just to propagate a narrative that is false both according to sources like dictionaries and style guides and according to the everyday experiences of 80 million germans . 
  they have the best trolls . 
  bigly so . 
  elon musk is so young that , funnily enough , the majority of europeans will have left school before he did anything noteworthy . 
  and really , the only people who seem to be downright worshipping him are americans online . 
  ah yes , the best proof for any claim is a random quotation by some fellow who many europeans probably have n't even heard of . 
  which `` categories '' do you lead in ? 
  mind showing some stats ? 
   the us is the number one country in the world by a big margin . 
  in what metric ? 
  oh , and in which war did the us single-handedly defeat europe ? 
  well , the both are n't exactly equal-sized , are they ? 
  i only learned about both through reddit . 
  i doubt the average german in the street knows who musk is or what he does . 
  it depends on * how * it 's brought up . 
  a factual , interested discussion in which it 's admitted that i might know more about my country 's history than you ? 
  fine . 
  considering it the only relevant fact about my country , and/or treating me as if i personally had committed crimes and lost the war ( bonus points if it 's done in a gloating way that makes clear that the actual victims do n't matter compared to scoring points ) ? 
  you can go shove it where the sun does not shine . 
  german ( native ) english ( fluent ) french ( some , used to be good at it in school , but am quite rusty ) latin ( three years in school , with a certificate and everything ) italian ( did a course , know mostly music-related terms ) danish - currently trying to learn some in self-study , traveling there in autumn and do n't want to just speak english at everybody . 
  can sort of read and/or understand , extrapolating from the other languages , dutch , spanish , portuguese , scandinavian languages . 
  well , if anyone wants to hear about fringe people , there was that family who asked for asylum in the us , claiming religious persecution , because they were n't allowed to `` home-school '' their children . 
  ( and no , there is no objection in germany from the two big mainstream churches to schools teaching about science or sex education , objecting to that is a true fringe thing here ) . 
  they were welcomed by us conservatives , because apparently refugees are ok if they look like [ this ] ( https://www.hslda.org/hs/international/germany/romeike_fam_fall_2013_web.jpg ) . 
  and then there was a family of `` reichsb\u00fcrger '' , that is our version of `` sovereign citizens '' who think our state does n't exist . 
  they fled to * russia * and asked asylum from the `` brd dictatorship '' . 
  among other things , they believe that children are victims to `` early sexualisation '' in kindergarten and schools , they think that humans are going to be forcibly injected with microchips , there are going to be `` forced vaccinations '' , people are supposedly not going to be allowed to `` say anything about foreigners '' ( note the irony in going abroad and asking for asylum because of that ) . 
  also chemtrails , bin laden being alive , and so on . 
  those people lived in a vw bus with eight people , among them a six-month-old baby , for several weeks .
