no surprise . 
  williams got a lot of his scores from the classics . 
  in starwars it was holst ( the planets , mars  main theme ) and chopin ( piano sonata no . 
  2  imperial march ) . 
  she was asked in an interview why cannabis has n't been legalized yet and that was her answer . 
  it 's also remarkable how often she mentions alcohol ( as a `` good '' drug ) when asked about other drugs . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojepatxrby8 ) she even tells that she once went a few weeks without drinking . 
  of course it 's pure bullshit . 
  these politicians insist that legalization = uncontrolled distribution , which no sane person ever wanted . 
  they go as far as even doctors and pharmacists ca n't be trusted because there * could * be some bad apples . 
  german federal drug commissary marlene mortler says , it ca n't be legal because it 's prohibited . 
  other politicians claim that criminalization makes drugs less available to minors . 
  how do you reach people in such a state of delusion ? 
  cucumbers pickled with mustard seeds . 
  they 're not only deliciously sweet and sour , they 're also a perfect combination with hot peppers as they ease the pain but preserve the taste . 
  basically the same in germany . 
  after the first frost everybody goes crazy over the first batch of kale . 
  more important is that they now teach religion ** s ** instead of a single denomination of one religion . 
  funny that you mention it . 
  today i met with a friend for a private election party . 
  he 's a a legitimate ` victim of the sed regime ' and he voted die linke because cdu and spd were just trying to sit the problem out for the last 25 years . 
  eli5 : all the day 's work is done by commisions which are dominated by coalitions of one or the other side . 
  those commisions have to work together to get things done . 
  imagine a district councillor of one side , who just got shunned by his side , tipping the scale on a controversial issue . 
  indeed , looking at the `` afd voters against merkel '' . 
  there wo n't be an afd senator but outside the senate coalitions have little meaning . 
  every seat in any function is given either proportionally or in terms . 
  the csu does n't run outside , nor the cdu inside of bavaria . 
  it 's an agreement they made after the war . 
  alas , the others have to . 
  [ my comment below ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/53crhw/state_election_in_germany_berlin/d7s4vr7 ), 
  the only problem is the way the parliament and district councils work . 
  they are organized consensual , so there 's no legal way to cut out a faction by ignoring them . 
  the last period put the pirates in charge of the ber airport commission , which turned out to the biggest pile of shit that could ever hit fan for those involved . 
  otoh , this usually sorts the weed from chaff quickly , even within factions . 
  sarrazin is still on his crusade against the local saracens . 
  sound like the same bs they come up with every other year . 
  let 's put up blinders for joe average and call everyone else a `` dangerous paedocriminal hacker '' as german minister ursula von der leyen once put it . 
  they should fine the managers instead of the smokers . 
  in berlin a bar owner would think twice before letting anybody smoke in a non-smokers bar , because tickets start high and go up to very hurtful next time . 
  is it illegal to smoke in public places ? 
  if not , people will keep smoking because it 's legal . 
  if yes , then people will ignore the new law as well , as long as nobody enforces it . 
  luckily we are 1 . have plenty of 2 . and 10 sundays a year . 
  you should get them . 
  they really tie the neighbourhood together , especially at night . 
  dark alleys become lively streets because people have a reason to go outside , which attracts more people to go and see who else is outside and so on ... 
  one more reason not to go back there . 
   ^ brb , ^ need ^ more ^ beer ^ and ^ some ^ fresh ^ bread, 
  one of the big questions in berlin 's upcoming elections is , how to handle all the `` sp\u00e4tis '' ( late night shops ) which do n't give a fuck about closing times . 
  everybody loves them . 
  almost everybody . 
  five parties are near 20 % at the polls , so this `` little '' issue could tip the scale . 
  in germany it 's complicated . 
  there are federal laws , then state laws , all the way down to town councils . 
  all of them can make exemptions for various reasons . 
  [ see here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4u3ltr/shots_fired_in_munich_shopping_centre/d5o2aqc ), 
  [ article \\ ( in german \\ ) ] ( http://www.welt.de/politik/article157245606/zeuge-wollte-amoklaeufer-mit-bierflasche-stoppen.html ) about the family that lives below the video guy . 
  the father got slightly injured by a stray bullet when he went outside to see what 's going on . 
  ok , still a bad idea when there are other people around who might not be aware of the imminent danger . 
  there was the octoberfest bombing by a neo-nazi suicide bomber in 1980 . 
  12 dead , over 200 injured . 
  each bullet aimed at an apartment building could hit anybody behind a window . 
   now stop smoking do n't tell me what to do , i 'm not in bavaria !, 
  the inmates are only there for a day or just hours . 
   approximately 300 meals to inmates , with 642 people spending time in the cells seems that most do n't spend enough time there to get hungry . 
  stupid sexy scotsman !, 
  not gon na happen with the unions . 
  they fought too hard for the five day week and they 're just as influential as the churches . 
  what 's that ? 
  yes . 
  nothing wrong with that . 
  i still have six albums . 
  he 's been my role model for 35 years now . 
  they 're all 45cm frames . 
  i ca n't ride on such a small bike . 
  it looks like most are in pictures of regional food , including the beverages . 
  knowing how proud the french are of their cuisine , this is n't too surprising . 
  the kiel canal has a little beach where swimming is allowed at your own risk . 
  it 's a small bay , so each time a big ship passes by the water rushes out and back in . 
  needless to say that you would n't want to swallow the water . 
   more fun . 
  serdar somuncu is ten times more fun than all of them combined and he 's as multikulti as it gets . 
  btw . 
  die partei is very good !, 
  i do n't know about your country , but here we have the freedom to express our personal opinion on whatever we want . 
  looking at berlin 's potsdamer platz , i think that 's not the way . 
  it 's a cold soulless place made for cold soulless high-society people who are completely detached from the rest of the city . 
  [ similar plans ] ( https://www.fastcoexist.com/3065494/berlin-is-ending-car-traffic-on-one-of-its-most-iconic-streets ) in berlin . 
  it 's time to reclaim and rebuild the cities for people instead of cars . 
  they 're not incompetent by themselves but mostly mislead by incompetent politicians , like senator henkel who abused them for his personal war against one house . 
  like angela merkel , dilma roussef , park geun-hye , tansu ciller ... almost hillary clinton . 
  you name them . 
  many know him as `` our guy in brussels '' . 
  few know what he was doing there and even less what he stands for . 
   strong female leaders maggie thatcher, 
  she is not supposed to fix things by herself . 
  she 's supposed to take care that things that need to be fixed on a federal level get fixed . 
  yes , but who 's the alternative ? 
  gabriel has no chance , everybody hates him .
