  schulz is largely unknown and has the charisma of a fax machine . 
  still the most reasonable choice for an unlikely red-red-green coalition . 
  ( better than kretschmann , imho ),

  can somebody do the [ italian ] ( http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/drachen/images/8/8d/grisu.gif/revision/latest?cb=20140717154153&amp;path-prefix=de ) version ?

  from my memory jewish guy : `` we 've been bullied by the romans and where are they now ? '', 
  italian mobster : `` they 're standing right in front of you . '', 
  according to that guy from the sopranos they still are . 
  he 's 70 or 80 . 
  not sure if he still cares about his balls . 
  my landlord is austrian and he thinks wearing more than a shirt and shorts is for pussies , even at -10 \u00b0 c. 
  surely not against the heat but it helps reducing the damp . 
   humidity jumps to 80 % ouch !, 
  maybe a dehumidifier ? 
  they cost about as much as a good fan , starting at 30 $ . 
  the best thing is to keep the sun and heat outside by day and let in the cool air by night . 
  neither the question nor the answer is in the transcript .

  i live close to one of the best gyros stands in town , but the guy is so greek that he 's unable to serve it without onions . 
   how to use the western toilet by far not only the chinese . 
  i work in a house with guests from all around the world . 
  everybody thought it was a joke when i put up instructional signs on every toilet door , but they save 100-150 $ per month on broken toilet seats .

  all your questions have been answered a thousand times . 
  au contraire !, 
  clearly means `` another compassionate acab believer '' . 
  there was a tribe that vandalized most of europe , until people started referring to them just as `` the vandals '' . 
  proof of their continuing existence is the cult around their alleged leader , named `` acab '' .

   hitler has nothing to do with this discussion legion condor rehearsing total war for the blitzkrieg ?

  he just had his kaiser-wilhelm-kanal built , which is internationally regarded as a huge improvement to the dangerous route around denmark . 
  tja, 
  two years ago a woman who grew up in east-germany said `` the simpsons '' are not as funny as `` pittiplatsch '' . 
  well yeah , a family sitcom may have a different target audience than a puppet show for toddlers . 
  my point : artistic styles do n't always translate well . 
  afd only 42,5 % away from a landslide win in september . 
  it is . 
  take the internet karma if you like . 
  i just went to my `` late-night muslim immigrant store '' ( he was smiling from ear to ear ) to fetch more beer and walked across a very cheery party in front of the new french caf\u00e9 . 
  that 's enough good feeling for today . 
  i 'm celebrating twice today . 
  my home state voted 94 % against the far-right , too . 
  you 're right that the afd wo n't do much harm on a federal level , but it 's satisfying to see them going down . 
  s-h has a very fragile economy and the people are very aware of that . 
  the right-wing has no economic concept apart from `` hurr-durr the immigrants '' which nobody buys after a minute of thought . 
  they 've coped with a hundred times more refugees after the war . 
  must be because it 's the anniversary of it 's premiere in 1824 . 
  meanwhile , today germans right-wingers afd took an epic nosedive in schleswig-holstein 's state elections . 
  barely over the 5 % threshold . 
  they 're already walking the plank , like the pirates did before .

  i 'm not a fan of the linke at all but opposite to merkel 's party , i do n't see a will to instate a surveillance state with censorship and lapdog trade unions . 
  wtf is this ? 
  tell me more . 
  who forced her to become not only a member of the fdj but a secretary of agitation and propaganda ? 
  then tell me why the cdu had the most ex-members ( per capita ) of the stasi in the first united bundestag . 
  so is merkel . 
  i 'm sure most people do n't like the idea of of putting a clueless sockpuppet in charge of anything . 
  why am i not surprised ? 
  they did n't just walk , they conga lined into mordor . 
   poor immigrants tend to all move to low income neighbourhoods . 
  they often would n't get any other place to move in . 
  integration was n't even wanted in germany for decades .
