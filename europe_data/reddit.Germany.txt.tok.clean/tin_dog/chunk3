  it was easier to do nothing to help the immigrants integrating and put all the blame on them . 
   gigantic beards overheard some young turks lately : - `` get a shave , dude !, 
  you look like a salafist ! '', 
  - `` fuck you , i 'm a hipster ! '', 
  is n't that illegal gay propaganda ? 
  if you plan a poutine airlift to ukraine , could you drop some on berlin ? 
  there are [ starving canadians ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/berlin/comments/1lustd/good_poutine_in_berlin/ ) here !, 
  mind the gap !, 
   museum piece loved the old schienenbus , even had the m\u00e4rklin model . 
  i had to smile when first i saw a turkish `` kuaff\u00f6r '' , because that 's exactly how a german would write `` coiffeur '' too . 
  one thing that makes me mad is teaching kids to focus on the light only . 
  they stand there like sprinters waiting for the shot , than run across the street without looking left and right . 
  all supervised by their kindergarteners . 
  after tax and everything less than 1000 $ . 
  that 's slightly above welfare level . 
  all the time : '' ... but it 's an automatic , can you drive that too ? '', 
  [ dithmarscher mehlbeutel ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/mehlbeutel#mediaviewer/datei:dithmarscher_mehlbeutel.jpg ) , a huge * pudding . 
   fromage blanc or flammenkueche both very common in germany , too . 
  study the music of humans in their natural habitat , as far as one wrapped it up for me . 
  [ currywurst und pommes mayo ] ( http://37.media.tumblr.com/f2c78cf909f7aac013f4f45c5b4607f9/tumblr_mqhv80zmxe1qbih6so1_500.jpg ) . 
  it 's okay , you can steal my bike . 
  then i can point at you if the dutch come asking again . 
  i rarely eat d\u00f6ner . 
   some other party cdu true , spd had to start from scratch and i still think b\u00fcndnis90 and gr\u00fcne should 've stayed apart , like cdu and csu . 
  in the first united bundestag the cdu had more ex-stasi members than any other party . 
  1000 $ a week ? 
  sorry france , you used to be cool . 
  it 's used as a park , good enough description for those who use it . 
  none of the plans prohibits plants , benches or a temporary ice cream stand . 
  the airport building is in full use . 
  it 's about new buildings on the field which is now a park . 
  edit : no , there are no weed plantations . 
  more like 10 % with all the construction sites in summer . 
  [ cato institute ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cato_institute ), 
  german feminists ( namely their figurehead alice schwarzer ) started to embrace the conservatives , since all sane progressives turned their back on their taliban-like stance of sex = rape . 
  [ good luck !, 
  ] ( http://www.viruscomix.com/page382.html ), 
  again , what about the other non health related aspects ? 
  are they irrelevant because biologists say so ? 
  reducing the whole debate to the question if it 's safe to eat does n't sound very scientific to me . 
  what about biodiversity and the huge socio-economical impact ? 
  speaking of belief , we all know that science is always infallible , right ? 
  my mum went there with the red cross in the early nineties . 
  from what she told the russians dumped them decades ago . 
  `` it has been said that on earth alone in our galaxy is [ krikkit ] ( http://hhgproject.org/entries/krikkit.html ) ( or cricket ) treated as a fit subject for a game , and that for this reason the earth has been shunned . '', 
  try harder , or less , i 'm not your mom . 
  then , why is n't it called worstminton ? 
  itt : [ eighties retro galore ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t-_7atmx-0 ), 
  reminds me of les rita mitsouko and plastic bertrand . 
  i love it !, 
  makes sense . 
  in lower-german it 's literally called `` old year 's eve '' . 
  munich , [ deutsches museum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deutsches_museum ), 
  i imagine something like the slang in ' a clockwork orange ' . 
  like that ? 
  they 're cool guys . 
  when you work with them imagine you 're on set with samuel l. jackson and you 're fine . 
  absolutely not in my experience . 
  yes , but with all the `` 2 $ / slice '' places it 's getting hard to pick a really good one . 
  i got some free stuff from a food fair . 
  pasta and pickled olives . 
  i 've been warned but it was even worse . 
  barilla , like the company that 's known for watering down their olive oil ? 
  sasha baron cohen as the referee and both coaches . 
  the north-frisians are officially a protected ethnic minority like the danes and sorbs . 
  northerner here . 
  it 's barely comprehensible for me . 
  dutch campers . 
  dutch campers everywhere !, 
  like [ this one ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bungsberg ) ? 
  sounds like `` rotkohl mit fl\u00f6he '' ( red cabbage with fleas ) to me . 
  a classic [ loriot ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f2jzbw3leq ) ( skip to 0:20 ), 
  believe me , it would n't . 
  major kottan !, 
  [ inspektor gibt 's kan. ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su5koqxnxn8 ), 
  veggie days * are * optional , so where exactly is the big difference ? 
  they 're taking away our daily meat !, 
  at least that 's what we were told about `` veggie days '' until last week . 
  `` rats fleeing the sinking ship '' is a common figurative phrase . 
  way more complicated because the bed was differently taxed than the included breakfast . 
  i 'm sorry for you . 
  [ i 'm ** so ** sorry . 
  ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/raining_david_tennant.gif ), 
  aaaand ... they 're toast !, 
  same with b\u00fcndnis 90 in the east and die gr\u00fcnen in the west , or the conservative/liberal swabian greens vs. the progressive/leftist greens in berlin or hamburg . 
  their slogan was `` effort must pay ! '', 
  they did n't specify whose effort would pay whom . 
  they promoted easier tax laws for everyone but the only thing they came up with was a reduced tax on hotels . 
  turned out they got a huge donation from the affiliated business association . 
  good thing that the german right-wingers have the same problem . 
  the unification of their main parties npd and dvu left them weaker and even more fractured than before . 
  fdp and linke are struggling . 
  if they both drop out then the majority will change from cdu/fdp to spd/greens . 
  this would cost the coalition 5 out of 15 seats in the bundesrat . 
  most greens and leftists see each other as either direct competitors ( west ) or bitter enemies ( east ) . 
  liberal rats are fleeing the sinking ship . 
  the fdp lost two third of their voters , mainly to the cdu , many to afd and pirates .
