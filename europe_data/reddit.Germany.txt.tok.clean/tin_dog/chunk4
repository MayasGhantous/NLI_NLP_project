  well done . 
  it looks like our tolerance for [ drunken politicians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/otto_wiesheu ) is a lot higher than yours . 
  we should import some of your attitude . 
  no german news about it at all . 
  maybe nobody noticed or gave a fuck , maybe it 's a hoax . 
  i see you can quote the teachings of con fu zem . 
  alas , her efforts to keep a clean and well supervised internet like in china are still lacking . 
  in colonial times edeka was a cooperative of groceries for imported food , like coffee or oranges . 
  i guess they 've built up some connections over the last twelve decades . 
  aldi were afaik the first in europe to put their warehouses on the street ( just-in-time logistics ) , thus making the taxpayer pay for the storage space while putting all the risk on the subcontractors . 
  germans spend too much time trying to bend the rules instead of just saying either `` jawoll ! '', 
  when the green light turns red they just freeze on the middle of the road , calculating the time to reach either side . 
  well , edeka was founded by colonial merchants who imported exotic food . 
  aldi introduced maximum efficiency in food logistics . 
   edeka not aldi ? 
  it 's getting worse since every upper class twat studies `` communication sciences '' while doing internships at local radio stations . 
  i hate it when they talk about `` fork music '' or `` loaf songs '' on the radio . 
  excellent choice !, 
  you 'd like an akg with this ? 
  move it to mars !, 
  let 's see how those medically enhanced superhumans do in a really challenging situation . 
   swedish left party politican accidentaly ( ? ), 
  tweeted a picture of his penis . 
   swedish left party youth wing wants to ban porn . 
  go home sweden , you 're drunk !, 
  regard billboards , acquire languages !,

  swedens voldemort, 
  laut google translate reden hier alle irisch . 
  it was very refreshing to have a danish co-worker for the last months . 
  as he 's from slesvig and i 'm from holstein it was like meeting a fellow expat . 
  it 's now called checkpoint disney since some investors turned it into a theme park . 
  the gallery is the east side gallery which is in friedrichshain district . 
  subscribe to / r/balkanmusic if you have n't already . 
  there 's way better stuff . 
  remember , it 's austria . 
  it 'll be more like a shotgun wedding . 
  do the dance of joy !, 
  what 's better , a clown president or cloned potatoes ? 
  meaning that youth projects will receive more cuts in favour of a new billboard campaign . 
  the south of france always felt very american to me . 
  endless plains and suddenly a giant store with a small town attached . 
  up to 10m native speakers of low german do . 
  for three minutes the snow outside was gone and the yard was full of flowers . 
  listen to their [ music ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yrivm8sc7m ) . 
  man , they got the blues !, 
  and an austrian linux distribution . 
  and her good friend liz mohn with whom she likes to have coffee with their chancellor . 
  i have a job , can i have an income now ? 
  i tried a japanese knife on german bread . 
  a lot of blood was involved . 
  that 's what happens when you give a hattori hanz\u014d to a lumberjack . 
  berlin is best in april/may or july/august . 
  weather in june is mostly meh . 
  there are tolls and taxes and fees and fines everywhere but there never seems to be enough . 
  i 'm all for shifting money from private to public transport . 
  it 's similar to taxing smokers for public healthcare . 
  that just does n't happen with our current politicians . 
  roads ai n't that much ? 
  are you kidding ? 
  the csu has good reasons to be nervous . 
  the absolute majority is gone and their only * willing * coalition partner fdp has become a loose cannon . 
   cricket aka [ krikkit ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/krikkit#krikkit ) . 
  `` krikkit also managed to leave other marks besides the destruction of numerous worlds : due to racial memories , the earth sport of cricket and the pan-dimensional sport of brockian ultra-cricket were based on the krikkit wars . 
  slartibartfast enjoys the game of cricket , but he notes that most sensible citizens of the galaxy find the sport to be in rather bad taste . '', 
  as a rabid anti-monarchist ( like my ancestors back to the 12th century ) , i 'd like to thank you for taking one for the team . 
  [ could be worse ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eefclydo06m ), 
  see it that way : they represent our mainstream political spectrum abroad in exchange for information/inspiration from there . 
  many poor but talented students receive stipends from those foundations . 
  i 'd say it 's a love/hate relationship . 
  while most people agree that there needs to be independent journalism , there 's a lot of dissent about the means . 
  many people argue about the programming . 
  they 're supposed to provide basic information as the constitution demands but that gets buried in dumbed down entertainment , commercial plugs and biased main news . 
  the organization that collects the licenses is hated by everyone since they act like a secret police . 
  yes , dozens of tv and radio stations . 
  most of them filled with the same crap you get from the commercial channels only with a higher production value . 
  they have 7 billion ( ! ), 
  euros to burn each year . 
  mandatory tv license ( 18 $ ) for every household , no matter if you own a tv or not . 
  when nursing old people their children may accuse you of theft or taking advantage . 
  happens quite often . 
  some people have fridging habits `` outsiders '' might think are weird . 
  ever had flat mates ? 
  and it has to stay in one piece when you spread half-frozen butter ( or cold nutella ) on it . 
  fun fact : you ca n't spread german nutella out of the fridge on non-german bread without ripping the slice apart . 
  different recipe . 
  noodles with nothing but sugar . 
  loved it as a kid . 
  [ do n't look at me ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=g9agcxcnnsu#t=158s ) . 
  it 's not only unbelievable , it 's 50 % bullshit and 50 % massively exaggerated . 
  the german sources are an infamous tabloid ( bild ) , a forum for xenophobic conspiracy nutjobs ( pi-news ) , and russian government propaganda ( rt ) . 
   there 's no reason why telekom should get preferential treatment there 's one reason . 
  as the former monopolist they own like 98 % of the copper wires and they 're still obliged to offer a land-line for everyone . 
  no surprise , they try to squeeze every last cent out of what they have . 
   his point is right-wing insanity ftfy, 
  this guy is truly a superior asshole . 
  i 'll certainly vote pirates again in local elections . 
  the do really good work in the community . 
  that 's what i think where they belong , doing grass-root work , not big politics . 
  the first slave workers were the unemployed .
