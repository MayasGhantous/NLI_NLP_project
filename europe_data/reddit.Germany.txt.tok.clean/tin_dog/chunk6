  an idea is not a proposal . 
  - define `` personal cars '' . 
  imagine cars as a cloud service, 
  yet another problem that has been solved more than a century ago by industrials like siemens , ford or borsig . 
   how does less competition equal lower prices ? 
  it does n't . 
  competition and prices are not directly related . 
   not just get rid of it altogether welcome back to square one . 
  nobody ever proposed that . 
  you 're still thinking inside your `` no more car , nothing else changes '' box . 
  delivery and other transport services could be much cheaper if they did n't have to compete with personal transport . 
  think about life quality if streets are not littered with cars but only those needed to keep things going . 
   everyone needs it at about the same time each day that 's not a natural law and it 's already changing . 
  flexible working times have been a thing since the late 80s . 
  nothing that ca n't be solved with a little bit of planning and networking . 
  thanks to the internet we already have the infrastructure that just needs some software and the will to use it . 
  if you need it for most of the day , you 're probably running a business . 
  that 's outside of personal transport and should be exempted , logically . 
  yeah , every car owner has their own personal issue , since we were socialized to depend on it . 
  it 's time to teach people how to find new ways , not to ban one thing without providing alternatives . 
  80 % of all people i 've lived or worked with are from all over the world . 
  these regional differences are mostly irrelevant outside their regions . 
  in berlin , london or paris it does n't matter if you 're from chile or peru . 
  i identify myself as a member of my subculture , not of my nationality . 
  there 's no distinction from koreans or fins in my view . 
  well , if you assume that banning cars as a one-stop solution without taking on other problems , you 're right . 
  first you have to improve all other ways of transport while making individual traffic less attractive to the majority . 
  in berlin supermarkets are so evenly distributed that even you grandma can walk there with her shopping trolley , even in the outer districts . 
  buses run all night every 30 minutes with stops within 10 minute walking distance , subways run at night on weekends . 
  too bad there 's absolutely nothing that can be done about those problems . 
  who said that car sharing , taxis and rentals would be banned ? 
  nobody needs a car 24/7 . 
  how often do you have to transport large things ? 
  i can easily rent a car or truck whenever i need one . 
  combined with a monthly ticket it 's still much cheaper than owning a car that just stands around 22 hours a day , costing taxes and insurances , wasting space , etc. 
  too bad that commerce in berlin fights for every parking spot and every centimetre of roads until death . 
  a kid got a surprise cavity search for buying long papers . 
  joke was on the cops , he was the only one in his group who did n't carry anything . 
  * also bavaria, 
  the company is a german cheese reseller , so probably made anywhere in the eu . 
  it just made me giggle . 
  germany guarantees you a basic income called hartz4 provided you agree to - work full time on a wage that merely keeps you alive - lay out your life before the jobcenter officials - temporarily resign some of your basic rights yes , statistically our standard of living is quite high . 
  too bad if you 're in the lowest 30 % . 
  edit : yes it 's all relative , but one compares to what one sees all day . 
  imho it does n't really matter who 'll be in or out , the only probable coalitions will be with merkel . 
  red-green wo n't happen , even less with a third partner . 
  only vans at work . 
  when i have the choice i prefer the mercedes sprinter . 
  where do you live ? 
  in berlin public toilets are also rare but they 're fully automated , very clean and cost 50 cents . 
  the company ( wall ) in turn gets free advertising spaces from the government . 
  great comment : i see that the desire of muslims applied here is ridiculed . 
  that 's what happens , because most ca n't put themselves in their shoes . 
  well , maybe the hooligans , but they should imagine that every two / three days would be bayern against kaiserslautern before they make fun of the muslims , even place themselves above them . 
  i did n't count in the deposit since i always bring it back . 
  hasser\u00f6der is not bad , kindl `` jubi '' and berliner pilsener are okay , sterni export is drinkable , so is holsten pils . 
  a kiosk in berlin : 14 litres of sterni at any time a kiosk in bavaria : no beer after 10pm, 
  okay , lets say a decent beer , good enough to drink all night . 
  berlin prices in the cheaper parts of town . 
  you can easily pay twice as much . 
  * dinner for two in a cheap restaurant with wine or dessert * cinema for two with drinks or popcorn * cheap jeans or shoes * basic internet or tv * a weekly ticket for public transport * two crates of good beer * three grams of good weed, 
  interesting . 
  now what do danes think about the [ danish chef ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw-z_fayivc ) ? 
  the default store brand is always esl but even my local netto has two or three brands of fresh milk . 
  sounds strange . 
  every supermarket i know has fresh milk , they just doubled the price . 
  i hesitate calling esl milk `` fresh '' but imho the difference in taste is negligible . 
  lawyer up or hit the gym . 
  german laws differentiate between opinions ( i believe he 's nuts ) and insults ( this guy is an asswipe ) . 
  our constitution starts with : human dignity is untouchable . 
  period . 
  a good start , if you ask me . 
  this inevitably leads to certain laws about personal honour and how not to hurt it . 
  bold resolutions sometimes get you more than you asked for . 
  i figured that . 
  `` nazi mentality '' come on , you can do better than that . 
  you sound like me when i was 17 , and i was still * very * naive back then . 
  you 're certainly an angry young man , which i can relate to , and i like your enthusiasm but imho your aggression is a little out of place . 
  wow !, 
  you 're so anarchist , you could n't even bother to read the topic of this thread . 
  now go out and tell your friends how you got oppressed by the nationalist mob . 
  actually they were excluded from ** every ** public office , even postal workers . 
  yes . 
  they can deliver any popular majority you want . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcvhb1wpfzk ), 
  after decades of being pampered , it 's about time for bavaria to pay something back . 
  do n't you think ? 
  [ i did n't ] ( http://www.google.de/publicdata/explore?ds=ds22a34krhq5p_&amp;met_y=gd_pc_gdp&amp;idim=country:de&amp;dl=de&amp;hl=de&amp;q=staatsverschuldung+deutschland#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=gd_pc_gdp&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country&amp;idim=country:de:uk:fr:it:es&amp;ifdim=country&amp;hl=de&amp;dl=de&amp;ind=false ) * [ u.s. numbers ] ( http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/165786/umfrage/staatsverschuldung-der-usa-in-relation-zum-bruttoinlandsprodukt-bip/ ), 
  you still have some things that are bigger than ours . 
  power outages for example . 
  do i trust my fellow citizens to behave responsibly ? 
  hell , no !, 
  most people i 've met waste resources like there 's no tomorrow . 
  do i trust society as a whole ? 
  well , it 's mostly better here than elsewhere . 
  we must be doing something right enough to make it work somehow . 
  i remember running around with the setup case . 
  it was quite a procedure to install a terminal . 
  do n't mention the kohl-era !, 
  confirmed .
