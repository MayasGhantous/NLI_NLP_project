  my brain says : we can try , let 's do our best !, 
  edit says : [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooi-ah73ac4 ) . 
  seriously , do something about it !, 
   he has a doctorate in history cum laude . 
  his dissertation is widely regarded as laughable . 
  wonderful !, 
  on second thought ** $ ** instead of ** e ** would 've looked much better . 
  [ as you wish ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1k6j4.jpg ) . 
  you 'd also have to pay a fine if you did n't pick up your dog 's shit . 
  does n't mean it ever happens . 
  ... at least in my area . 
  if urinating in public was illegal here , half the population would be in jail . 
  i like how it 's handled here in berlin . 
  a general ban in public places with the exception of `` smoker 's clubs '' i.e. 
  very small pubs without employees . 
  nobody gets forced to smoke second hand but smokers still have a few places to go . 
  i grew up with lower-german ( platt ) . 
  since it was a lingua franca of the north for a long time ( through the hansa ) it makes most germanic languages readable at least . 
  written dutch and platt are almost the same , only we do n't use the `` ge '' in infinitive verbs , like english , unlike standard-german . 
  pronunciation is a different thing . 
  most germans do n't understand platt at all . 
  [ yes , it is true ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8wkohdpifc ), 
   it needs to consider its neighbours as family firstly the german states need to consider * each other * as family , which wo n't happen in our lifetime . 
  just do n't deal or do them in public and you 're fine . 
  the cops are busy catching dangerous fare dodgers . 
  yes , do n't we ? 
  looks like i 'm not one of * your * germans . 
  jews have gone rather well with me as far as i remember . 
  come over , try our free methadone programs and our lax laws on small amounts of everything !, 
  100,000 is n't very much for a * pro * - government rally , especially if the government has a 2/3 majority . 
  just saying, 
  friede springer and liz mohn . 
  springer is a jellyfish compared to bertelsmann 's kraken . 
  [ this does n't sound fine at all . 
  ] ( http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/19/hungarys-constitutional-revolution/ ), 
  i 'm sure they 've seen murkier times before . 
  i 've read that mussolini was a major pain in their ass by using their own methods . 
  nothing that a government would dare to do nowadays , not even berlusconi . 
  dear fdp , `` effort must pay ! '', 
  was the slogan you were elected for . 
  where have all the voters gone ? 
  they took you by the word . 
  good bye and thanks for nothing !, 
  i remember driving around with eight ( 8 ! ), 
  people inside . 
  greatest prank : a guy went outside from a party to find his duck disassembled in the parking lot . 
  took him two hours and a wrench to put it together again . 
  i 'd love to have one , no matter what engine . 
  too bad the only ones available now are held together only by paint and good faith . 
  neubauten jumped the shark with that album . 
  labrassbanda is the shit , ca n't stop listening . 
  movie : kebab connection, 
  as a descendant of the peasants republic of dithmarschen , regarding what luther thought of peasant 's human rights , i have to say : ** fuck luther !, 
  we 'll send many couriers with money next holiday season . 
  just welcome them as you always do . 
  make that 36000 for berliners . 
  thank you , wowi for reinstating the old sch\u00f6neberg-connection that brought us into this mess . 
  do n't forget you 're navigating through pirate waters now . 
   they should also differentiate between germans and their government first rule of tabloid media : the others are communazi child molesters . 
  i was at the next control point , at invalidenstrasse , at that time . 
  it felt totally surreal. , i was sitting at my desk , writing a letter , listening to the radio , when that line hit me : `` die mauer ist weg . '', 
  ( the wall is gone ) . 
  years of wtf ensued . 
  bielefeld is exactly half way between brandenburg and belgium . 
  it must be them !, 
  there are wolves in brandenburg . 
  must haved slipped through western germany like ninjas . 
  good question ... 
  it was different , but not very much . 
  both kreuzberg in the west and prenzlauer berg in the east were populated by the young , creative and rebellious part of their societies , long before the wall came down . 
  in the 70s/80s it was sexy enough for david bowie , iggy pop and nick cave . 
  who am i to disagree ? 
  you can have flensborg if you give us r\u00f8m\u00f8 . 
  deal ? 
  berlin has always been in a constant state of flux . 
  we could handle the wall and we surely can handle easyjetsetters and schwabylonians . 
  we are berlin , you ( or your kids ) will be assimilated , resistance is fruitful !, 
  up ewig ungedeelt !, 
  i 'll have dinner at a greek restaurant , does that count ? 
  so , we need new methods of law enforcement because the old ones have repeatedly been proven sufficient . 
  i get it . 
  titanic keeps a horde of top-notch lawyers to get away with jokes like this . 
  when in berlin you should do some music on the streets . 
  people will appreciate it . 
  it 's a damn shame , that each society has to go through this phase . 
  probably , with a little help from the eu , things will change soon . 
  it 's not only little kids . 
  what about the youth ? 
  the [ knaack-klub ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/knaack-klub ) had to close after more than fifty years because some assholes moved into the neighbourhood and found out that a club next door is too loud . 
  some kids get frustrated and torch up some of those asshole 's suvs . 
  who do the media blame ? 
  yeah right , those terrorist kids . 
  let 's put them into jail , together with those who could n't pay their train ticket . 
  snacks ok platt ? 
  obviously not a northern part . 
  i completely agree with you , i just wanted to clear up the false or misleading statements . 
  i wo n't call out the us for censorship when i ca n't watch hulu . 
  just tried it . 
  [ first ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfe3cu_xw84 ) [ two ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omu1aesndze ) videos worked just fine here .
