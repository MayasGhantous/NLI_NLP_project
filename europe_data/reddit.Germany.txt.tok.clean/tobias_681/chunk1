but asking to quit nato , because it ` could reduce russia 's ability for a nuclear retaliation ' is ridiculous . 
  on top of that are individuals who ask for an abolition of the bundeswehr . 
  both of these ideas are so massively unpopular that they could never go through with them . 
  they would probably need to rule alone ( have more than 50 % ) to do that . 
  apsrt from that , i do n't think a majority wants to abolish the bundeswehr , only reduce it ( which i would welcome ) . 
   another thing is their stance on refugees and actually everything concerning foreigners . 
  if a interview or a speech comes to my attention , it is unconditionally in favour of the seemingly weak . 
  that gives me the impression , that they do n't think delicate topics through , but show knee-jerk reactions . 
  i think some of the only sane and forwardthinking ideas i 've heard about this came from the left . 
  the parties in general do n't really support the sane proposals though . 
  for instance wagenknecht ( who is afterall the biggest figure of her party ) was heavily critizised for her comments about refugees by the rest of her party . 
  kretschman was by the greens too for agreeing to a compromise . 
  however i do n't think there is such an overwhelming difference between left and right . 
  both sides mostly have knee-jerk reactions and then a few have thought more in depth about it . 
  the knee-jerk reaction of the right is mostly focussed on just getting rid of the refugees and not about actually solving the problems ( it 's in no way more conciderate than the left side knee-jerk reaction ) . 
  i think the left has made better proposals for the future but especially the greens have also said a lot of stuff which was detached from reality when it came to tackling the crisis right now ( at times it even seemed like they thought it was a good thing ) . 
  generally i would support stricter regulations here but then also a lot of help to the regions which are the most pressed ( you ca n't flee from syria to germany for instance , if the situation in the neighbour countries were better , people would n't even come here ) . 
  however the current crisis in this mose acute form is over and right now we need to invest as much in integration as we can ( because otherwise these people inevitably drift into criminality ) and at the same time be prepared to send the people back if the war ends soon ( syria surely needs those people to be rebuild ) . 
  likewise the entire west needs a different orientation towards 3rd world countries because we breed the refugees of tomorrow by war ( mostly the us to be honest ) , climate change ( which disproportionally hits poor countries ) and eonomic overpowering ( with all the shit we 've done and still do in africa it 's no wonder they have trouble building up their own economy ) . 
  the problem is that no party really represents this stance but at least it is echoed in parts of linke ( for instance i think it is relatively close to wagenknechts stance ) . 
  the rhetoric of the right parties is focussed on getting rid of the problems of today , while building even bigger ones for tomorrow , i 've rarely seen them think beyod the current crisis . 
  for instance i think it 's dangerous that first we let so many refugees in ( more of a left stance ) , then we have a rechtsruck and then we do n't increase integration spending or perhaps cut other important benefits . 
  then the refugees becomming criminal really is a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
  i would wish we would have coherent politics in those regards but it 's almost impossible in todays political landscape . 
  discourse is almost dead , it 's all about opinion now . 
  i would have rather expected that wallonia would lack behind , they seem to generally do worse than flanders ( in most fields ) . 
  it 's not like my opinion on belgium is based on anything though , just the occasional slander you pick up here and there . 
  i 've never been there myself . 
   i do n't refrain from voting afd per se well , one of their campaign promises is actually to cut politicians income . 
  still they are basicly an even worse version of the cdu . 
  who would want that ? 
   go full retard and commit seppuku with the sed ? 
  they 've done a very good job as an opposition party ( and we both know they 're not the sed but one of multiple modern european left parties ) . 
  you do n't have to be afraid of them governing if that 's what you 're concerned about , it 's very unlikely . 
  hm , interesting questions . 
  i think if she does not become chancellor again there is the chance that she might step down . 
  however the cdu does n't really have too much of a replacement i think and she is `` only '' 62 so perhaps they might still keep her around because she is really popular and she draws a lot of votes which the cdu would not get if they put up a chancellor which is as conservative as the party in general . 
  if a replacement would be just as left is a somewhat tricky question because the cdu would certainly need such a replacement to stay relevant but i do n't know if they have such a person . 
  mrs. karrenbauer from the saarland seems quite popular but i have no clue about her positions . 
  oh , well that 's indeed an effective strategy . 
  it feels rather shady though , i 'd rather the cdu would lose fair and square . 
  but then again : if the cdu would have such an oppurtunity , they would n't hesistate for one second i guess . 
  oh , i was n't implying belgium would lack money , i just intuitively would not have expected them to be big in green energy . 
  lol , what 's the point of this ? 
  the cdu will not agree and they know it . 
   a majority of the population is for legalizing same-sex marriage  cdu ( including merkel ) do n't want it . 
  the cdu is 20 or so years out of touch with the population . 
  the only way they keep relevant is by swallowing the proposals of the opposition once they become popular enough . 
  even merkel is already way to the left of the cdu . 
  hurray for double standards !, 
  i am disappointed by the netherlands ( probably due to all the liberalists in government ) , denmark , luxembourg , austria , liechstenstein and maybe belgium and ireland a little . 
  it 's obvious that the other states do n't have enough money for this shit . 
  yes , i know . 
  something must have went wrong in the formating . 
  it is there when i click to edit the text but when i save it , it disappears . 
  ah , yes there he was known as the poet soselo . 
  here is one of his poems : the bud has blossomed ; now the rose touches the tender violet . 
  the lily , bent above the grass by gentle breezes , slumbers not . 
  the lark , signing its chirping hymn , soars high above the clouds ; meanwhile , the nightingale intones with sweet , mellifluous sounds : `` break forth in bloom , iberian land !, 
  let joy within you reign . 
  while you must study , little friend , and please your motherland ! '', 
  yeah , kind of . 
  they 're trying to be more modern now but they 're still the fdp \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
   and vote cdu instead to continue the current grand coalition because if there is anything that truly excites the people it 's a grand coalition . 
  also i must say that personally die linke is the party i have heard the least factual arguments against and yet everyone and their mother on reddit seems to hate them . 
  is everyone here from the ddr or what ? 
  simple solution : just do n't vote cdu . 
  what would be the use anyway ? 
   my real question was directed at the benefits to the population/system/state at large . 
  oh , in that case i do n't think there are many benefits ( if any ) . 
  yes , her campaign really was a gigantic blunder . 
  i think picking warren as vp could have already given her the victory ( i 'm unsure though , i would love to have data from a parallel universe on that ) and generally those personal attacks were such a ridiculously bad strategy because it removed all accountability from trump , because his policy positions were never really challenged ( you do n't attack a clown by calling him a clown , that only makes him more popular ) . 
  i think this is truly the biggest lesson to take from this election : only substantive arguments , no name calling , no circus . 
  i 'm a little bit frightened because in europe i see similar strategies as hillarys against right-wingers ( although they 're not remotely on the same level of absurdity ) because people do n't realize that demonizing them only helps them , while their weak point are their policies . 
  the way it is right now , right-wing parties criticize a few problems in our society that the other parties do n't want to confront so openly ( kind of like with trump and his `` crazy ideas '' ) and that 's what people hear , while the rest of their program is often appaling . 
  note : i really do n't like clinton though , so maybe trump winning is the comeuppance the democrats needed so that perhaps next time they will allign more with people like sanders ( who i 'm quite positive would have won in a near landslide ) . 
  i think 4 years clinton might have just bred another trump in 2020 . 
  4 years of trump might breed a great president in 2021 . 
  this is extremely theoretical though and we would still have to go through 4 years of trump ( ouch ! ), 
  ** here is a study on hilary 's campaign ads ** ( done by an outlet that actually supports her ) : http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/3/8/14848636/hillary-clinton-tv-ads ** tl/dr ** ( or just the first lines of the article ) : `` hillary clinton 's campaign ran tv ads that had less to do with policy than any other presidential candidate in the past four presidential races , according to a new study published on monday by the wesleyan media project . '', 
  and ** hillary ** spend and incredibly ammount of money on those ads , much more than trump . 
  i think 25 % concerned policy . 
  policy was very much not one of her strenghts the way she ran the campaign , she might have known quite a bit about it and she might have had some of it in her plans but she never talked about it . 
  and many of her promises sounded like lies or oppurtunism ( tpp for instance or gay marriage ) . 
  saying policy was one of her strengths is an insult to quite a few politicians who actually discuss substantively in public and not just behind closed doors . 
  personally i think her campaign was abysmal . 
  as for ** trump ** : he really sounds more like someone 's crazy uncle . 
  he said a lot of things but they usually contradicted each other : famously he had 2 different opinions on abortion on one and the same day . 
  likewise he promised to stand up for the lgbtq community ( directly after he won ) but he also promised to install a super conservative judge on the surpreme court . 
  i think a lot of people ( even many of his voters ) did not take a lot of what he said seriously ( i mean how could you if he seems to have 2 opposing opinions on many topics ) . 
  people cherrypicked from what he said . 
  i do n't think that goes for substance ( his ads were overwhelmingly more substantive than clintons though , according to the study 70 % of trumps attack ads contained some discussion of policy , compared to 10 % for clinton with 90 % going only after trump as a person ) . 
  note : i did n't say that either ran on no substance at all , just that they both ran on very little substance . 
   what would be the benefit of a candidate in an election waiting until after the vote to set out their political viewpoints ? 
  -  they ca n't be attacked based on their political viewpoints -  noone can accuse them of not living up to their promises later -  they can smear the other candidates and present themselves as a cure against all the bad stuff that is happening ( and it 's kind of hard to counter them because they have n't said what they are going to do ) in the time they would usually need to explain their viewpoints . 
  quite a few politicians today run on very little substance , they would n't do it if there was no benefit . 
  i mean look at trump or hillary . 
  * sorry for replying to a rethorical question but i could n't resist . 
  i do n't necesarily think that 's gorbachev 's fault . 
  the udssr was incredibly fragile and unsustainable when he came to power .
