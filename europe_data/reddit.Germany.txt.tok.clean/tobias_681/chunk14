  enforcing existing hate speech would be to drag an individual user to court over whatever he posted on facebook or twitter which to my knowledge is already possible . 
  the idea of this is precisely to keep the courts out of it . 
  it 's meant to be effective but in reality it will streamline discussion . 
  how can private companies shield themselves from being dragged to court ? 
  they ca n't monitor everything that happens on their websites manually . 
  they 'll use algorithms that will delete much more than they 'd have to . 
  it 's censorship . 
  it 's scary . 
  the newest poll still has cdu+spd at 63 % after this . 
   ~ ~ well intentioned but ~ ~ stupid law . 
  fixed this for you . 
  i see no good intentions . 
  ~ ~ fuck ~ ~ ehr , i mean all hail our glorious f\u00fchrer mr. maas . 
  ok , on a serious note : why do we have to pass such a regressive law ( which is probably illegal itself while we 're at it ) ? 
  just why ? 
  and i thought we were concerned about not looking too much like nazi germany ... 
  i mean i already dislike my government but this is one of the few things which does n't just depress me but makes me straight up angry ... 
  where did iceland come from ? 
  seems like it . 
  ba-w\u00fc looks very weird . 
  yeah , i figured he must have meant the actual value of it and not just the numbers on coins and bills after posting . 
  but still the max lira being less than 200 euro would be weird . 
  thanks for clarifying . 
  oops , here 's an italian 500 lira coin then : http://coinquest.com/cgi-data/cq_ro/response_380/italy_500_lire_1958.jpg, 
  you mean like [ these ] ( https://image.stern.de/6695266/16x9-940-529/8cdc4a039209460ff81e2e039ebce3fa/fd/5-euro-muenze-planet-erde.jpg ) ? 
  austria also has [ some nice ones ] ( https://www.muenzen.eu/tl_files/bilder/oesterreich/5-euro-kupfer-feldhase-2016.jpg ) there is also [ this 50 euro coin ] ( https://www.muenzen.eu/tl_files/bilder/deutschland/50-euro-lutherrose-2017.jpg ) . 
  they are all officials coins but more something for collectors . 
  often prizes are higher than the vlaue printed on the coin . 
  the worth of the material of the 50 euro coin is around 300 actually . 
  the austrian coin i think you could get in exchange for 5 euro though . 
  got ta catch them all ? 
   even 200 $ is already more than twice the largest franc note there ever was , twice the largest italian lira ... [ why do they make 150 lira coins then ? 
  ] ( http://www.antalyacollection.com/prodimages/fao1979_150tl_on.jpg ), 
  nazi architecture is fairly derivative and there 's tons of just ugly blocks . 
  everything has to suggest grandeur and that 's the prime goal . 
  however much of it is actually quite impressive like the olympia-stadium , the reichskanzlei or the parteitagsgel\u00e4nde in nuremberg for the sheer size . 
  they really are incredibly affective buildings , though rather simplistic . 
  hitlers taste in art was full on kitsch but he surrounded himself with more capable people . 
  i see where you are comming from calling it anti-creative but they were trying to build a foundation for a new society , i 'd say some of it was very creative ( like germania or goebbels bureau which was much bigger than it needed to be to intimidate people ) but much was n't realized . 
  of course it got nothing on weimar which it destroyed and often the kitsch levels are over 9000 . 
  the cdu alone does not have a majority and public opinion would have been with spd . 
  well , the 3 other parties in parliamanent could have just pushed for it anytime if they wanted . 
  they had the majority . 
  wait , she 's only 48 ? 
  just do n't vote for her ( cdu/csu ) ? 
  i know i wo n't . 
  wikipedia says it 's every year : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberation_day_ ( netherlands ), 
  but in that timeframe they were 1 among 2 major parties ( the other being the democrats ) . 
  further they were not reformed into the republican party but they fell apart any many former members joined the republicans but many other former members joined other parties aswell . 
   ( presuming you 're talking about the uk ) no , i 'm talking about the us party . 
  should have specified that i presume . 
  it is possible for big parties to be totally eradicated in a first past the post system . 
  you ever heard about the whig party ? 
  anyone know why the numbers are so high for switzerland . 
  is it muh freedom ? 
   politicians and eu supporters obviously mean to convey that the eu has a larger economy than the usa when they recite this statistic but it 's not true [ it is true , it 's just still not the biggest market ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp ) without the uk it will likely not be anymore though . 
  they do the vote before the election . 
  i think that 's fair . 
  they ca n't promise you to do it after being elected if they already did it so if gay marriage is something you would vote on , this is effectively removing that incentive . 
  according to surveys our acceptance towards gays is the 2nd highest in the world right after spain . 
  i disagree . 
  i think it depends on your definition if you can call him a nazi sympathiser or not . 
  ** english ** :  election gains of nazi party candidates in municipal , state and national elections in 1930 and 1932 were significant . 
  adenauer , as mayor of cologne and president of the prussian state council , still believed that improvements in the national economy would make his strategy work : ignore the nazis and concentrate on the communist threat . 
  adenauer thought the nazis should be part of the prussian and reich governments based on election returns , even when he was already the target of intense personal attacks . 
  political manoeuvrings around the aging president hindenburg then brought the nazis to power on 30 january 1933 . 
   by early february adenauer finally realized that all talk and any attempts at compromise with the nazis were futile . 
  cologne 's city council and the prussian parliament had been dissolved ; on 4 april 1933 , he was officially dismissed as mayor and his bank accounts frozen . 
  `` he had no money , no home and no job . '', 
  after arranging for the safety of his family , he appealed to the abbot of the benedictine monastery at maria laach for a stay of several months . 
  according to albert speer in his book spandau : the secret diaries , hitler expressed admiration for adenauer , noting his civic projects , the building of a road circling the city as a bypass , and a `` green belt '' of parks . 
  however , both hitler and speer concluded that adenauer 's political views and principles made it impossible for him to play any role in nazi germany . 
   adenauer was imprisoned for two days after the night of the long knives on 30 june 1934 , but already on 10 august 1934 , maneuvering for his pension , he wrote a ten-page letter to hermann g\u00f6ring ( the prussian interior minister ) stating among other things that as mayor he had even violated prussian laws in order to allow nsdap events in public buildings and nazi flags to be flown from city flagpoles , and added that in 1932 he had declared publicly that the nazis should join the reich government in a leading role . 
  indeed , at the end of 1932 , adenauer had demanded a joint government by his zentrum party and the nazis for prussia . 
  - wikipedia ( note : the texts are not direct translations but the german and the english wikipedia entries respectively ) . 
  yes , that could be argued . 
  however he did n't effectively support the nazis after they took power and changed sentiment about them . 
  but effectively he did nothing against them either . 
  a resistance fighter would have made a better figure as a 1st chancellor ( not that he would have necesarilly been the better chancellor on policy ) . 
  he is a little like merkel during the gdr . 
  silent and rather conform to the system on the outside ( of course the comparison is a little off as adenauer did go to prison and tried to stay as unnoticed as possible while merkel led a normal gdr life ) . 
  only that addenauer comes with a little more baggage as he was among the hitler-enabler-wing in the centrum party . 
  but even though i think the failure of centrum is among the least forgivable ones ever ( and adenauer was a part of this ) , i 'd give everyone the chance to learn and grow . 
  we ca n't judge people by their past mistakes forever when they clearly moved beyond them . 
  however i 'm still not a fan . 
  i think his mistake with the nazis is also somewhat connected to a flawed character ( = huge conservative bias , not the greatest thinker ) . 
  as for first chancellor we could have done a whole lot worse though . 
  holy shit . 
  conditions in russia are worse than expected . 
  could n't they at least pick lenin ( or even khrushchev ) ? 
  [ not officially . 
  as of now their party leader only recommended it ] ( http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/bundestagswahl/fdp-macht-ehe-fuer-alle-zur-koalitionsbedingung-im-bund-15075368.html ) . 
  so we will have to look for updates on this about wheter the party actually goes along with him . 
   interestingly enough they still entered a coalition in 1957 regardless , so my point stands . 
  coalitions were part of every single government . 
  but my point stands aswell . 
  they had a total majority . 
   that a person that is running to become prime minister or chancellor does n't actually win when they become prime minister or chancellor well , they still need to be voted for by the majority of the government but as far as the election goes , their party did n't `` win '' . 
   the second party and staying in opposition for the ** next four years ** . 
  right , that 's not going to happen .
