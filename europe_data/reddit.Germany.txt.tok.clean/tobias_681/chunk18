  further paul ryan is n't any more clear-minded than trump because trump is perfectly sane . 
  he just knows shit about leading a country , he 's not the sharpest knife in the drawer and he 's immature . 
  that 's some bad qualifications to become president but it does n't make you insane . 
  and that 's not the end of it . 
  look at this !, 
  ** m ** argaret ** t ** hatcher ** t ** heresa ** m ** ay now if that is n't conclusive evidence i do n't know . 
  some scary shit is going on . 
  i do n't think that 's likely but they only need 313 anyway ( because of sinn fein not taking their seats ) and they got that already . 
   plus sein fein do n't actually vote so the majority mark is really 323 322 actually as they gained 3 seats . 
  you have no 2 party system ( fptp ) either . 
  the vikings should have just kept england under their control back then . 
  it would be a much better place ( because of no fptp , vikings would never have such crap ) . 
  con+dup sounds like it 's almost certain . 
  lib-dems have stated already that they will not form a coalition with the tories . 
  do n't they need 312 ? 
  how likely is a con+dup coalition ? 
  it looks like that 'll be a possibility . 
  snp did actually outperform the projection by now . 
  it had them at 32 . 
  now they have 33 . 
   they 're going to get in while the majority of scottish people have nothing but contempt for everything they stand for . 
  then many of the people who hate them must not be voting because in the constituencies they are winning they get more than 40 % . 
   a split vote between the snp and labour caused a lot of the seats to be given to the tory 's . 
  that 's not really the case . 
  try to check the changes in the individual constituencies . 
  labour gains a very small ammount . 
  conservatives gain big time and snp loses a lot . 
  here 's angus for instance ( i picked it completely randomly but it 's the same about everywhere ) : conservative ( +16.2 ) , snp ( -15.7 ) , labour ( +4.2 ) , ld ( +0.5 ) . 
  labour and ld together have about 15 % . 
  technically it 's true that if every labour voter voted snp , they would have won but that 's not the explanation for what is happening here . 
  former snp voters are voting conservatives this time . 
  gains and losses match almost 1:1 . 
  sinn fein gaining 3 seats , dup gaining 2 . 
  now northen ireland is devided between 2 parties ( and one independent candidate ) . 
  starting to look like a con/dup coalition . 
  dup gained 2 seats already and conservatives only lost 3 up until now ( edit : 7 now ) . 
   by the election polls it would take every single other party joining forces , unlikely at best . 
  nah , they could do without 1 or 2 of the minor parties depending on how big they are . 
  for instance labour could get a majority without dup but then they really need all the others . 
   minority governments are not very rare in parliamentary systems -- canada had minority rule between 2006 and 2011 , for instance . 
  denmark currently has one . 
  i think they only have about 25 % of the vote . 
   pence would be bad , but bad within normal human standards * rolls eyes ... *, 
  if pence really goes too , it 's president paul ryan . 
  there are no reelections . 
  best case scenario is if trump stays until 2021 . 
  yeah , sure but the exit polls tend to be very accurate . 
  they were swallowed by the conservatives . 
  sure but usually you still need a majority and i do n't really see where they should get there . 
  if labour want to get to a majority , they need almost all other parties behind them . 
  minority government is of course a possibility or the actual numbers differ from the exit polls in a way that matters . 
  the question is which coalition government . 
  if numbers hold true it would be hard for most coalitions to get to a majority . 
  conservatives + both northern irish unionist parties would still not get there ( assuming they do n't gain any seats ) . 
  i guess it could be a minority government or the exit polls swing a little towards the conservatives yet . 
   what does it mean ? 
  can labour and snp form a government with some little parties in this scenario ? 
  not with those numbers . 
  labour , snp & ld combined have as many seats as the conservatives . 
  but it 's only an exit poll . 
  it does n't need that much change to tip it in either direction . 
  exit polls in the uk tend to be relatively accurate though . 
  this looks interesting . 
  i guess the conservatives could coalition with some ni party ( the 2 unionist parties likely ) but if this result holds and neither of the ni parties gain any seats , they will still have no majority . 
  labour would also have a hard time getting to a majority . 
  labour , snp & liberal democrats would only just get to the conservative number . 
  but of course there can still be fluctuation in all directions . 
  [ this actually seems surprisingly accurate . 
  ] ( http://www.people-press.org/2017/05/03/public-trust-in-government-1958-2017/ ), 
   i do n't know how anyone can justify staying home on election day ... might be because it 's illegal in your country . 
  are those seats or percentages ? 
  edit : i assume probably percentages . 
  edit2 : you 're actually missing the qriously/wired poll which has labour at a 2 % lead or is that one somehow less trustworthy ? 
  yes but i was confused because it said neither eastern roman empire nor byzantine empire . 
  yeah , i know , it 's basicly a catholic invasion of the byzantine empire . 
   i 'm asking for a friend . 
  it 's odd that it says italienisches kaiserreich ( italian empire ) instead of byzantine empire . 
  edit : i just realized i misread . 
  it says lateinisches kaiserreich ( latin empire ) . 
  it 's the empire established after the 4th crusade . 
  that sounds really weird , especially as the brits could potentially get in a situation where plaid cymru and snp are the king makers and from my understanding snp is closer to labour than to the torries but i might be wrong . 
  we 'll set it up on the north pole and then we turn it on ... and zapp !, 
  we 've got them all glued to our giant magnet within minutes . 
  sounds like a good plan . 
  lumping up liechtenstein with luxembourg due to both being small nations in the middle of europe is a rather big mistake because liechtenstein is in fact so small , it makes luxembourg look big ( it has 1/15 of luxembourg 's population which is about the same ratio as luxembourg and germany ) . 
  my city has almost 3x its population and my city is barely among the 100 largest german cities . 
   hence why greenland left and the faroe island and iceland never joined it 's a little more complicated for those as people in greenland are actually citizens of the eu . 
   greenland , an autonomous constituent country of the kingdom of denmark ( which also includes the countries of denmark and faroe islands ) is one of the eu 's overseas countries and territories ( oct ) . 
  greenland receives funding from the eu for sustainable development and has signed agreements increasing cooperation with the eu :  greenland joined the then european community in 1973 as a county along with denmark , but voted to leave the ec in 1982 and left in 1985 , to become an oct. . citizens of greenland are , nonetheless , eu citizens owing to their danish citizenship . 
  faroe islands are actually not part of the eu ( because of , you guessed it : fishing ) . 
   poland and hungary seems to be the primary beneficiary http://i.imgur.com/5spqoax.png?1, 
   we have been in unions several times before * and it never worked out * so we are natural skeptical . 
  is that a euphemism for being controlled by forreign forces for half a millenia ? 
   yes , but a slight temperature rise will probably make us suffer a lot more than that flooding , drought and famine in the rest of the world . 
  flooding will also affect europe serverely . 
  wow , luxembourg has the 2nd highest gdp per capita in the world but their eu contribution per capita to the eu is ranked 11th ? 
   `` there is no longer any soviet union but nato is still there . 
  the question is , what for ? ''  `` if you 're not intending to attack anybody , why increase your military spending ? '' these are the central statements . 
  i think in essence he 's right . 
  the problem is that it does n't allign with his politics .
