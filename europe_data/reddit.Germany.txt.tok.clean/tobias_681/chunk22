  this is n't news . 
  obviously we 're not interested in a war with russia . 
  apart from that it reads like war propaganda . 
  putin is not going to invade the baltics or anything . 
  maybe if russia gets another president but right now there is no reason why russia would invade eastern europe . 
  yes , evidently the spd is trailing the cdu by 12 points . 
  schulz severely lacks profile . 
  oh ok , i knew that the danish crown was and thus assumed the swedish would be aswell . 
  is n't your currency linked up with the euro anyway ? 
  it would n't make much sense ... 
   now it will be hard for him to get that topic back from the cdu the cdu 's attitude towards europe is basicly that they buy our stuff and they provide us with cheap and/or educated labour . 
  and then perhaps they give them some money so that they can continue to buy our stuff . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  taking the theme or europe from them is easier than stealing a lollipop from a baby like we say in germany . 
  lol, 
  wait , how does that work ? 
  do you go to prison for not voting ? 
  war is an authoritarian thing i 'd say . 
  you 'll have a hard time winning a war if everything is up for a vote . 
  being a democracy is n't inherently connected to have the most will to win the war either . 
  look at japan vs. usa in ww ii for instance . 
  it 's pretty clear that the japanese were more determined , however they were outperformed by american tech . 
  nazis are very close to center on the left-right scale but on the very upper edge on authoritarianism . 
  the irony is : mussolini used to be a communist . 
  mussolini is no top right , he 's top center . 
  political compass usually has parties more to the right than general opinion has them . 
  are the libdems more libertarian than the green party though ? 
  snarky oneliners are pretty shit tbh . 
  oh , that sucks , is study-time at least shortened ( like you 'd only have to do one extra year if you have the education in another state already ) ? 
  well , the authoritarian hardliner stuff came after hitler came to power , he did n't run on a promise of becomming a dictator or something like that . 
  i do n't think as much authoritarianism as late 30 's nazi 's is currently even possible in western europe . 
  so the conditions are different but ideologically i still think it 's a fairly good match . 
  why ? 
  no , they 're in the reagan/tatcher corner ( neo-conservatives ) . 
  if anything [ le pen ] ( https://www.politicalcompass.org/images/france2017.png ) is [ litterally hitler ] ( https://www.politicalcompass.org/images/axeswithnames.gif ), 
  which uk party is eu center then ? 
  huh , i 've never heard of that . 
  at my school in schleswig-holstein we had a teacher from bavaria and i assume he studied there aswell . 
   when is a nondemocratic government better ? 
  for instance in war democracy is usually scaled way back . 
  look at roosevelt or churchill for instance . 
   they called it like that , that 's about it . 
  not even that . 
  yes , i 'm aware he 's overwhelmingly popular . 
  steinmeier is more popular but it 's hard to be unpopular as president because you have no real power . 
   macron has killed them more like sucicide ... 
  the problem is that the cdu/csu has no visionaries , at least none with a vision which i would like ( a la privatization of highways ) . 
  if merkel would be pulling sch\u00e4uble 's ears it would be alright but that 's not what she or anyone is doing . 
  they almost seem a little afraid of him . 
  now that babi\u0161 guy truly sounds terrible ... 
  i was n't saying you should vote for them but if you do n't want right-wing politics you should probably not vote cdu either and this is what it 's all about afterall why the cdu is doing so well , not why the spd is doing so poorly . 
  it does n't make much sense to vote cdu if you dislike that the spd is doing right-wing stuff . 
  spd is n't doing too great in polls either . 
  they 're lagging 7/8 % behind cdu . 
  what are peoples reason to vote for him ? 
  i did n't say that germany would have defeated the ussr but without pressure from the other front they could simply have fallen back to poland or so and easily have held their defences . 
  i think i confused something . 
  interest rates are n't that high actually but the greek still have to massively cut pensions and welfare . 
  you 're right , he is right now . 
  sch\u00e4uble is # 2 with merkel . 
  but steinmeier is president . 
  it 's easy to be popular when your job is to sit round in a castle and visit other countries . 
  [ congo is about the size of the dutch empire ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/dutchempire15.png ), 
  the usa would have never gotten involved the way they did if britain fell . 
  it 's not that clear really . 
  without uk/us , the ussr could n't have defeated germany and without the ussr , uk/us could n't have defeated it . 
  if the question merely is about who did the most to win the war it should probably be ussr because of all their soldiers who died . 
  but if it 's about who was the most instrumental , it 's hard to say . 
   `` few responded that it was another country besides the three listed , but 4 % of germans did , and many of them wrote in `` germany '' or `` germany itself '' '' way to go, 
  well , you have to consider that in the last election 40 % of germans ( who voted ) actually voted for the cdu . 
  often i do n't understand it either but that 's just what they want i assume . 
  [ looks like steinmeier overtook him some time but he was formerly the most popular and is still # 2 ] ( https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/169582/umfrage/beliebtheit-von-politikern-in-deutschland/ ) [ here 's the politicians rated from +5 to -5 ] ( https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/1817/umfrage/noten-fuer-spitzenpolitiker/ ) note : steinmeier is our president though . 
  he has nothing to say , that 's probably why he 's so popular . 
  it 's dubious if sch\u00e4uble and schulz really mean the same when they talk about a common budget though . 
  i mean sch\u00e4uble also agreed to give money to greece , only at astronomical rates and with the condition that the greek fuck over their pensions and stuff . 
  means nothing as long as he 's not either winning the election or is able to convince [ our most popular politician ] ( http://noch.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/schaeuble-ohr-540x304.jpg ) of his plan . 
   i hope that , ** if ** germany wants it too , we will achieve it within 10 years . 
  not as long as sch\u00e4uble and merkel are our 2 most popular politicians . 
  [ they were a satelite state and thus part of the bloc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_bloc ) you mean that they were not part of the union which i never claimed they were . 
  but it changes nothing about that they were controlled from moscow . 
  estonian gdp per capita is still 10 times that of tajikistan . 
  in relation you 're doing well . 
  for comparison : a country with 10 times estonian gdp per capita would be by far the richest in the world and would be about 3 times as rich as # 2 . 
  ah thanks , that 's interesting to know . 
   not to mention 1 `` small '' piece of land in the middle of africa does n't make you a colonial power . 
  and if your `` small piece of land '' is 76 times the size of your country and the 11th largest country in the world ? 
  that 's only half of the truth . 
  the czech republic , poland , baltic states ( and then some more ) and the german gdr were formerly part of the capitalist west and they were significantly haltered . 
  all 5 former german gdr states have a significantly lower gdp per capita than the west-german states . 
  bavaria has 172 % of the gdp per capita of mecklenburg vorpommern . 
  germany only has 145 % of czech gdp per capita . 
   all countries got leveled to piss poor . 
  that 's a blatant lie . 
  czech gdp per capita is still 4 times that of ukraine or 5 times that of uzbekistan or 6 times that of moldova or 9 times that of kyrgyzstan or 11 times that of tajikistan ( all are former sovjet republic states ) . 
  meanwhile german gdp per capita is n't even double the czech gdp per capita . 
  the baltic states are an exception . 
  it 's the area of the former teutonic order and throughout the years it has been part of sweden and germany . 
  you were basicly a port between east and west with massive influence from scandinavia and germany and with huge trading capacities . 
  it 's more or less the benelux of the east only with more war .
