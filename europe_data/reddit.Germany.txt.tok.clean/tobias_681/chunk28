  we care a billion times more about our national heads of state and the majority of people do not understand how the eu really works ( this is partly because there really is a lot of bureaucracy though ) . 
  if the eu should work we need to overcome this and at the same time we need stronger regional governments to take care of their regions because you ca n't pay close attention to individual regions from brussels . 
  so i guess a little more like the us . 
  we also need to ** fix our disjointed economy ** to make the individual regions allign better with each other ( not like the north/south line we currently have ) . 
  this would basicly be handled by shrinking national governments aswell . 
  then the eu could actually tax the same everywhere ( with slight differences between regional governments ) , invest where it 's needed and maintain a financial policy that works best for the entirety of europe . 
  currently each state tries to be the best and within certain limitations that 's fine but if we start to build renewable energy in places where it 's less effective than in others just because of state competition that 's incredibly stupid ( just one out of many examples because we actually do that in germany between the states and i find it ridculous ) . 
  we also need ** better cultural understanding ** , ** less us-culture import ** ( who needs that anyway ) and ** more exchange within europe ** . 
  we do legitimately have much more culture than the us ( the us is less than 250 years old ) , why the fuck do we import so much from them ? 
  look at films for instance , all from america . 
  you could tax them for instance or subsidize national cinema more . 
  when germany blocked foreign film imports around ww i , it initiated the best decade in german film history . 
  the goal should be to at least balance the culture import/export between europe and the us and to further exchange within europe . 
  i 've never seen a film from hungary for instance or greece but i know that they have relevant cinema . 
  why not promote that more ? 
  films are perhaps the best media we have to stimulate cultural understanding . 
  if you see the world through the eyes of people from greece or slovenia or spain or sweden , etc. 
  they become much more relatable and it 's easier to be sympathetic to them and their problems . 
  i strongly belive that change has to come from the bottom of society , not from the top . 
  so above all we need cultural renewal , eu culture and not an eu culture of levelling down but of an eu culture of shared diversity . 
  note : this is n't multiculturalism though as the eu has a deeply connected history already . 
  our culture is similar enough to talk about a european culture in a broad sense . 
   why do you think electing someone else is going to stop one of the biggest industries in the country from having a say ? 
  simple : https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article138941661/parteispenden-wer-von-wem-wie-viel-geld-bekommt.html short breakdown : this is a graph of donations to parties above 10.000 euro in the 2013 election cycle . 
  as you can see csu and cdu get about 2/3 of all donations . 
  the joke is that they 're basicly one party ( or at least a very close union ) . 
  about 75 % of the remaining 1/3 goes to the fdp . 
  and the last 25 % of the last 3rd are split between 3 parties . 
  and the party that took the least , linke , does not take donations from corperations at all . 
  if you google linke and lobbyism the only thing you 'll find is basicly them fighting lobbyism and their policies to do so ... 
  so if they 'd get 51 % in election our lobbyists will probably have to find new ways . 
  even if fdp and cdu/csu perform poorly lobbyism would take a big hit already . 
  clearly melenchon who has been fighting the le pens for more than a decade sees it as his duty to vote for her ... / s, 
  macron says that frexit will be the climax of the status quo . 
  he does not even explicitly say that he would n't do it . 
  melenchon says that he 'd frexit himself if the eu does n't reform . 
  they are basicly saying the same thing ( when it comes to the reason melencon was labeled an eu enemy at least ) as it does n't matter who frexits if they both think it 's ultimately the consequense of an unreformed eu . 
  the media better portray macron as an eu enemy now if they want to seem believable . 
  i 'm sorry but i have to laugh so badly right now . 
  the media spent all this time building the portrait of the big eu enemy melenchon ( even going so far as to downright compare him to le pen ) and now macron says about the same ... what will the media do now ? 
  probably just overlook it i guess but it reveals their glaring ignorance . 
  and macron even confirms melenchon 's hesistation to vote for him when he says :  `` so i do consider that my ** mandate ** , the day after , will be at the same time to reform in depth the european union and our european project . '', 
  no macron , with 24 % in the first round you do not have a mandate . 
  god , this is revealing . 
  what else does `` doing his duty '' mean then ? 
   has he officially said that he will vote for macron ? 
  he said he will do his duty . 
  i think that 's quite clear . 
  100 % agreed . 
   he should tell that he will vote macron because he really does n't want le pen to win which is just what he did ... 
   is this really the best time to play `` beat the ideologically impure lefty '' instead of trying to illustrate why macron is a viable candidate to bring france into the future ? 
  or is the media just going to keep playing into conceding the whole ideological battle to le pen but painting her as too scary to vote ? 
  he merely says that he does not support macron 's plans . 
  is it his job to suddenly step behind macron and like everything macron wants to do just because macron won barely the first round ? 
  no , it 's his job to stand up for his supporters and stand for the politics he campaigned for which are in direct opposition to what macron wants . 
  he said that he will do his duty ( vote against le pen and thus for macron ) but he does not do it out of support . 
   that 's just winning the current battle but conceding the ideological war to her . 
  she 's either going to win in the next election or a new white-washed party that offers exactly the same she does but in a less scary way will . 
  could n't melenchon win the next election ? 
  he only got about 2 % less than le pen and he gained 13 % this election compared to the eu election , le pen actually lost 3 % or so . 
  ehrm ... he said that he will vote for macron ... 
   both meckpomm and saxony had them for two legislative periods in a row up until their respective last elections when they were replaced by the afd . 
  oh , i did n't know that ( but maybe in saxony it is to expect ) . 
  nice to know . 
  but do n't you see , they decided completely voluntarily to remain like a poor as shit 50 's version of korea because obviously they 're doing much better than the south . 
  that 's funny because the npd even has `` democratic '' in their name . 
   you have a neo-nazi party ?!?!, 
  yes , but they never made it to the federal parliament . 
  they made it to at least one state parliament in the past but that 's long ago and they 're doing rather poorly today . 
  but the results that macron and le pen have are misleading because they suggest that they have more support than they actually have . 
  the reason for the 22,23 % not voting does ultimately not matter . 
  the point is however that none of them supported macron or le pen either . 
  ultimately whoever of the 2 will win , does effectively represent less than 1/5 of the french population . 
  yes , 46 is closer to 50 than to 33 ... 
  ... but only about 35 % voted for either macron or le pen and neither of them got even 1/5 of all the french people behind them . 
  i explicitly wrote 1/3 of all french people , that also includes the people that did not vote at all , presumably because they liked none of the choices . 
  the bots are taking our jobs !, 
  great way to get them to participate / s, 
   did you mean should have ? 
   what is point of their protest ? 
  to show that they like neither of the choices they are offered ? 
  ultimately only about 1/3 of all french people voted for either macron or le pen in the first round . 
  democracy is participatory . 
  if you are dissatisfied with your government ( or the government that is to come ) you have to protest it to show opposition . 
  if noone stands up politicians eventually do what they want and pretend they have a mandate or some bullshit . 
  if they are constantly protested , even before elected , they 'll have to play it safe and cater to the wishes of the protesters , at least a bit . 
  if some of them turn to vandalism , that should of course be condemned . 
  i do n't get why everyone is against this . 
  what 's wrong about voicing your opinion ? 
  ultimately one of them will be elected and of course they know that but if you think both choices stink , you have every right to protest the system and show that you like neither choice . 
   now i known the far left hates democracy but they are just going to have to deal with it . 
  protesting = hating democracy ? 
  which of these defintions did you reinvent ? 
   they just adjust a bit to better fit some country specific differences . 
  so are bit more anti eu , some more anti muslims , some are anti gay , some okay with it ... 
  yes , exactly . 
  each of these parties is adjusted to the general bias of the individual country ( however the fn still matches better with our npd than the afd ) . 
  i would actually prefer the fn over the afd but it 's really a choice between death by hanging and death by poisoning . 
  le pen is a national socialist . 
  she does match better with our npd ( aka .
