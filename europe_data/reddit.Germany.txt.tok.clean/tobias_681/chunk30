   and macron would n't be a catastrophe , he 's at worse gon na continue what holland has been doing , at best gon na transition us towards a german model as far as workforce goes which is n't necessarily a good thing , but that 's not catastrophe by any stretch . 
  if slightly worse than now is a catastrophe for 20/25 years old people , well there is a perception problem in this country . 
  if he would continue like hollande who has an approval rating of almost nothing by now that would be a shitfest . 
  the catastrophe in it is that developments today are very fast and there are certain things we do have to react to very fast . 
  in theory i could see macron actually doing something about some of it but i rather expect hollande 2.0 . with more liberal economics ( which will worsen the situation for the poor and shrink the middle class further ) . 
  there is n't an actual catastrophe in the scenario itself , nothing that would be entirely unfixable but we 're not rational beings and our system is very stale . 
  the real macron catastrophe would be increased social unrest and then le pen 2022 . 
  a clear downwardsspiral into the abyss , while not adressing any of the many problems we face today ( the maybe impending dissolution of the eu , incredibly unequal distribution which could unleash mass imigration that would make the refugee crisis seem like a joke , global warming and the destruction/poisoning of the enviroment we have to live in , a better chance of war than we had in a long time , a seeming inability to transition the job market into the future , etc. ) . 
  it 's not so much that macron is a disaster . 
  i do n't hold anything against him personally and i do n't think him dumb ; the disaster would be if macron wo n't do anything to prevent the disaster . 
  i agree almost entirely with your 2nd and 3rd paragraph . 
  i do n't agree with people not voting macron but i wo n't call them childish , as i said , i respect their beliefs . 
  i agree that neither melenchon 's plan nor macron 's plan seemed like a real solution . 
   who votes for socialism ? 
  socialists ? 
  i have another question : who votes for liberalism ? 
  when has an 18 % lead become dangerously close ? 
  that 's basicly about the same it 's been the entire time . 
   casting invalid/blank vote is literaly the same as not voting from dictionary.com * literaly * = * actually ; without exaggeration or inaccuracy : *, 
   and just like hollande be a puppet for merkel it 's funny that you say so because the german government more or less endorsed him ... actually it 's not very funny . 
  i 'm sorry , i just think it 's very stupid and arrogant that they did it . 
  when has liberal become synonymus with left . 
  the sovjetunion was the excact opposite of liberal . 
  are they right wing now ? 
  nah , he 's economically liberal aswell . 
  but fillon is too . 
   and therefore macron is too * liberal * for me fixed that for you . 
  economically le pen is further to the left . 
  that 's the same everywhere but it 's not reflective of the entire left because there is a grand spectrum . 
  for instance the leader of our left party advocated for a more restrictive policies regarding immigration/refugees ( not the position of her party btw ) , then some people threw a cake at her at the convention ... my overall concern is that people say they are left but they care jackshit about economics ( which is the prime concern of left politics or at least has been for like 100 years ) , only identity politics and then they antagonize right wing parties but are unable to win discussions agianst them ( they do n't even try ) . 
  in germany in the east there are also a lot of poor people voting left because they 're the successor of the sed and they oppose the satus quo . 
  however the best reflection of what you described in germany are the greens , not the left . 
  the left actually advocates for policy that cuts the money of rich people quite a lot , i do n't think they would be compelled to vote for them . 
  the greens on the other hand ... let 's just say they 're extremely inconsequential ... ( they do have politicians i like but they 're split between being identity politics neoliberals , a left leaning progressive party and conservatives + ecology ) . 
  our traditional left party ( spd ) kind of became indistinguishable from the cdu ( christian-conservatives/neoliberals ) . 
  to be fair : the new left is n't necesarilly progressive . 
  the left in germany is in love with the 70 's . 
  they might be more progressive than most of the other parties but overall they 're still conservative . 
  there is a very interesting discussion between a progressive philosopher and the leader of the left party and it gives one an overwhelmingly clear impression when he tells her , there might not be enough jobs anymore and she maintains that we need to reverse agenda 2010 and make jobs turn out a living wage again . 
  it wo n't work ( expect if you expect to pay people for useless jobs or to put a super-tax on robots ) . 
  the sad part is , that i 'll probably still vote for them because the vision for the future of the other parties is effectively an oligarchy the way it 's going right now ( ok , part of the afd also offers fascism , to be fair / s ) . 
  the leader of the green party in my state has a progressive agenda but he lost the vote for their prime candidate . 
  i think that 's about as close as we get . 
  from my impression other left parties are similar , although i was somewhat impressed by melenchon 's comprehensive reform program ( i was n't completely won over by the details but i think he adresses some of the big problems , you know the problems that macron denies do even exist ) . 
   it 's childish ; i ca n't have what i want hence you will all suffer !, 
  i 'm saying this about the people that know and admit that fn will be a catastrophe for france and europe but still choose to willingly increase its percentage in the second leg . 
  that 's childish . 
  what if people think macron would be a catastrophe and would higher the chance of a le pen victory come 2022 ? 
  another consideration that could go into this : high percentage wins are usually seen as a mandate ( which macron does by no means have but if he wins 70/30 against le pen people might construct it that way ) . 
  if you do n't want macron to have a mandate and look at the polls the reasonable thing would be to either not vote or to vote le pen . 
  this could obviously backfire horribly and i would n't encourage it but people do n't understand that some people are really , really unhappy with macron winning . 
  it 's not just that they do n't got their preferred choice , it 's that they think he 'd be horrible . 
  personally i do n't think that 's necesarry a given ( although i certainly think it 's not unlikely ) but one got to respect the opinion of people at least , instead of calling them childish fools . 
  that would actually enhance democracy , if we would discuss that stuff instead of accusing the opposing sides of being idiots . 
  do n't you remember how that worked out for clinton ? 
  `` trump voters are a basket of deplorables '' , well turns out that does n't help you to gain voters ... gee , who would have thought ? 
   spoil the vote ( vote blanc ) . 
  this is engaging with the process but refusing to express a preference between the remaining candidates . 
  this is the same as saying `` i 'm fine with either outcome for the second round '' . 
  more like : `` i 'm ** not ** fine with either of the outcomes '' . 
   it is true that in countries where gerrymandering is possible there problems of legitimacy . 
  well , there are different concepts that are more and less democratic . 
  i 'd say the swiss system is quite democratic . 
  if democracy means that the people have the power , it 's pretty darn close to communism though ( because money = power ) . 
  yup , germans seem to be especially bad when it comes to understanding this ( but to be fair : people generally are regardless of nationality ) . 
  we are merely outraged at brexit , le pen , trump , afd & co. but we do n't really question why they are so popular , beyond calling the people that vote for them stupid at least ( great tactic , ehr ? 
  i think all of the aforementioned are ridiculously stupid btw but there is a reason people are voting for them , even intelligent people . 
   i personally voted leave because the eu eventually wants political union , but i do not , i think the more local a voting area the better . 
  there is no contradiction between more local government and more europe government , it merely implies : less national government . 
  as i see it that is our one and only chance if we do n't want to end as a toy between china and the us . 
  that 's what i 've always been saying : by our standards hitler was a brilliant politician . 
  that 's less a positive for hitler than it is a negative for our political system ... 
  i have the same impression but i think it 's a dumb idea if we meddle too much with other countries politics . 
  it was also dumb that our government more or less endorsed macron because that 's an argument le pen can use against him . 
  of course you have to make your stance clear to the german public but german politicians shoot way beyond that much too often . 
  from http://www.rense.com/general37/char.htm:  ** powerful and continuing nationalism ** - fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos , slogans , symbols , songs , and other paraphernalia . 
  flags are seen everywhere , as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays . 
  - should be obvious ...  ** disdain for the recognition of human rights ** - because of fear of enemies and the need for security , the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of `` need . '', 
  the people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture , summary executions , assassinations , long incarcerations of prisoners , etc. 
  - le pen considered to put death penalty on a referendum . 
   ** identification of enemies/scapegoats as a unifying cause ** - the people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe : racial , ethnic or religious minorities ; liberals ; communists ; socialists , terrorists , etc. 
  - this should be pretty clear ...  ** supremacy of the military ** - even when there are widespread domestic problems , the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding , and the domestic agenda is neglected . 
  soldiers and military service are glamorized . 
  - she wants to sharply increase military and police spending . 
  they vote for her in high numbers ( 50 % in last election i think ) . 
   ** obsession with national security ** - fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses . 
  - again clear . 
   ** religion and government are intertwined ** - governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion . 
  religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders , even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government 's policies or actions . 
  - `` we need to save our christian values ''  ** obsession with crime and punishment ** - under fascist regimes , the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws . 
  the people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism . 
  there is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations . 
  - again clear , especially considering what i already said about death penalty and her position on is , refugees , etc. 
   ** rampant cronyism and corruption ** - fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability . 
  it is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders . 
  - pretty apparant when you consider the le pen families position in the party . 
  the following i could see le pen doing when elected :  controlled mass media - sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government , but in other cases , the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation , or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives . 
  censorship , especially in war time , is very common . 
  -  corporate power is protected - the industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power , creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite . 
  -  labor power is suppressed - because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government , labor unions are either eliminated entirely , or are severely suppressed .
