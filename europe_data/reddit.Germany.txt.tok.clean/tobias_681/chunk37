  that 's not cool . 
  let 's maybe not do that . 
  ** netherlands ** : yes dude , i feel you . 
  ** others ** : hm , no idea man . 
  but stars are cool , the americans have that too and they 're gigantic things allover the nightsky , everyone enjoys them ... ** luxembourg ** : but what do we do with the stars . 
  ** france ** : do n't know but we kinda like the number 12 . 
  all the superstitious hated us for making 13 regions in france but we here in the government thought it was a good number , even de gaulle personally said he thought it was pretty cool . 
  maybe we could make something close to that but more neutral . 
  you know , like 12 , everyone can get behind that . 
  ** germany ** : yeah , twelve is great . 
  i do n't know why but i just kind of like the number . 
  ** belgium ** : yeah guys , i really like the idea . 
  we here in belgium always liked 12 , already before everyone else . 
  it 's a good number . 
  ** netherlands ** : i can see it in front of me . 
  12 is the best number i tell you !, 
  the very best !, 
  but we need to put them in a ring so that it will look big and connected you know . 
  ** italy ** : yeah guys , it 's not like we really care but 12 is better than other numbers i guess . 
  i mean like it 's not 13 , that would be bad , and it 's not one so vietnam ca n't sue us . 
  also 2 would be uncool , then we would be germany , france and co. . we here in italy would prefer not to be `` and co. '' . 
  but 12 is vague enough that noone will know what it means . 
  everyone will ask , why must there be 12 stars and noone will know . 
  we like that idea , it 's a good tactic to confuse potentital enemies . 
  ** all ** : ok , lets just put 12 stars on the flag because ... it 's simply a good number . 
  and then they made their report and in their reasoning they explained : `` we picked 12 because it is a good number '' . 
  this gives one a good idea about the effectiveness of our sanctions : http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2016/02/blogs/graphic-detail/20160206_woc909.png * putin anexes crimea ( and we sanction ) = putin 's popularity skyrockets by 20 points ( which is more than hollande has at all ) from 60 to 80 . 
  * rouble collapes = putin 's popularity remains unchanged . 
  and how exactly do you want to do that ? 
  kinda yeah . 
  that 's great and the fdp actually keeping the state small were i want it to be small . 
   diversifying european oil and gas supplies made a priority how about actually , you know : reducing emissions ? 
  apart from that schr\u00f6der can do whatever he wants . 
  he 's not our chancellor anymore . 
  sanctions will not help to stop putin from killing his enemies . 
  they could actually help putin because then we 're the enemies of the russian people and that 's what we do n't want . 
  information is our ally on this , if russians could be better informed on the shady side of putin 's government that would be great but putin is already very controlling over the media that gets into his country . 
  for instance there is no facebook . 
  but i would assume there would be something in this line we could do . 
  we have to convince russians that we 're doing better than them . 
  that 's the best we have . 
  are n't the us the ones that label us progressive ? 
  as of now there are still only 4 parties in the bundestag and the spd only sits there with 25 % , the cdu with 40 + . 
  i agree with you on everything but the `` realit\u00e4tsbezogenheit '' of the parties . 
  i do n't think any of them does that well as i have said and in that department i see no difference between linke and cdu . 
  they just are cut off from reality in different ways . 
  privatizing the roads for instance ( which would also require spd support ) is an asbolute idiot move and will not improve anything , their refugee politics are a disaster because they do not remotely care about the future ( neither in germany nor outside ) . 
  they should have given aid to the stable regions around syria from the beginning ( or at least from when it started to get bad for real ) to avoid something like this . 
  now we have to pay even more . 
  they should speak up against arming the rebels . 
  their politics polarize europe and might implode it . 
  there is much more . 
  yes , a corresponding party is basicly # 1 in the netherlands . 
  i assume it 's partly because of bad leadership ( even with better leadership they would never be close to the biggest party though ) and partly that there is no german tradition for it . 
  pure conservativism and socialism has always been more what formed the discourse in germany ( although socialism is heavily toned down today ) . 
  we had the hanse i guess but that 's very long ago and that was only the north . 
  maybe if a north and south germany would have formed in the 19th century , the north would be a bit more like the netherlands . 
  and maybe another problem of the fdp is that they have trouble setting themselves apart from other parties and that we like enviromentalism . 
  in that case maybe voting for the greens or cdu is more alluring to many people . 
  but personally i do not want them in the bundestag . 
  westerwelle ( their former leader ) was against going into libya and for that i apllaud him and the fdp but otherwise ... meh . 
  but he also promised to put in a highly conservative judge on the surpreme court ( who will surely rule against it ) and that 's what matters in practise , not what he personally says about it . 
  it 's not given that they would rank higher , although i assume at least one of them would . 
  a very sad reality . 
  there is n't much to say about it other than r.i.p. 
  they do seem like on the upper end but of course you ca n't look through the categories . 
  maybe `` wirtschaft/handel '' means `` kassierer '' but i doubt it . 
  it 's not bad that they would have good education though . 
  i just wish we had more philosophers , scientists and artists and less lawyers , officers , teachers , buisnesspeople , etc. . that 's not to say i do n't want lawyers , buisnesspeople and the likes , of course we need them too but their representation is outside of any proportion and they tend to have no vision for the future . 
  ideally we would have all major jobs represented in some way ( maybe not in the same proportions ) , i 'm sure they all have something to offer . 
  and likewise it would be nice if politicians would be better to curate . 
  on almost every field they discuss , they could find someone more knowledgeable . 
  why not involve them more ? 
  what i 've always been saying is why not get a national debate on climate change for instance and then every party can nominate one scientist . 
  then we can see how convincing the arguments of the afd really are ( here 's a hint : they follow a philosophic doctrine which is almost completely rejected today and in their scenario we can basicly only lose but noone points that out , regardless of wheter climate change is true or not their argument is shit , that 's a new level of bulshit-artistry ) . 
  sorry for digresion but i wish we would do stuff differently . 
  they are the 3rd biggest party in the bundestag and on course to become that again . 
  of course many people do n't like them but people on this sub and especially r/de do love to shittalk them . 
  that most people do n't want them in government does n't explain why it 's oh so scary . 
  th\u00fcringen had n't become the next sovjetunion last time i checked . 
  some of their top politicians ( like gysi ) are very rational . 
  the broader spectrum of them perhaps not so much . 
  i do n't think the other parties are great at that either . 
  they only aknowledge the realities they like and govern according to that . 
  there is nothing that speaks against left rationalism . 
  i do n't think the cdu is particularly rational about many things for instance . 
  and many of the left 's principles are commendable like their firm anti war stance . 
  i would not like them to compromise there and in some cases the compromise is not neccessarily the sane position for the future . 
  but of course they are willing to compromise , they are in multiple state governments , do you think they got there by screaming : `` no , never ! '' ? 
  it 's as much the spd ( or their voters ) that do not want to collaborate . 
  they had the chance last time but rather formed a grand coalition . 
  no , that 's often part of it but populism is broader than that , it means appealing to the masses ( opportunism ) , once you start to put more into it , you 're bending the word and start to ideologize it . 
  this is something the english wikipedia does not aknowledge ( german wikipedia and duden do actually ) . 
   yes , our governments get more money even at the same tax rate since we 're richer , not sure what you 're getting at ? 
  i was saying that you probably need that money for your system to work because your governmet spending is very high aswell . 
   right ? 
  le pen has quite a few social policies . 
  the afd used to be small state conservatives . 
  they are moving in the le pen direction but they 're not quite there yet . 
  petry leaving the afd now is probably another stepping stone in that directions .
