  it 's only relevant for macron vs. 
  le pen and seems shoehorned for that . 
  yeah , it 's debatable . 
  i also do n't think he is as far right as they have him ( i would put him maybe in the middle right ) . 
  if everything would work out as he says , it would n't be that bad but i 'm not convinced it will all work like he envisions . 
   edit : tried to google this specific outlier and ft seems to think it 's total bullshit . 
  no us libertarian would ever say this in a million years : well , the nordic economy model thing is definitely major bs though . 
  have you ever looked at their taxes ? 
  i actually live at the danish border . 
  danes come here all the time to buy stuff because it really is considerably cheaper . 
  furthermore their cars and houses cost so so much more and even food is really noticeable ( food is mostly what they buy here , especially beer ) . 
   so my early conclusion would be that this political compass thing seems like complete bullshit . 
  their focus is not to represent what is public opinion ( public opinion would be that macron is a centrist ) but to create an easily decipherable and logical representation . 
  left for them is purely economical and means protectionism . 
  right is economic liberalism . 
  i explained a bit more why i like that further down in the thread . 
  yeah , i assume in the case of such a big and old party , loyality could surely play a role . 
  it starts to baffle me how many people seem to think melenchon is anti eu though . 
   i did not downvote your post , if that 's what you 're asking . 
  no , i did not mean to suspect you , i only took the opurtunity and mentioned it on general terms as an appendix to the answer . 
  oh , that 's good to hear . 
  hopefully they actually get some decent jobs that are somewhat connected to the field they are trained in . 
  yes , the popular vote polls were actually only off by about 1,2 % , that 's a very normal divergence . 
  well , why not ? 
  i commeted one or 2 spaces above that it is not the usual definition of left and right but that it does make a lot of sense ( maybe it will interest you to hear that they also place hitler about where they place le pen , their definition of far right is much different ) . 
  i would not place macron that far to the right myself but economically his policies are really liberal . 
  he wants to cut the state down and open up for european trade . 
  if all of that would really work the way he says ( which i doubt ) , it 's not even that stupid if the tax cuts end up benefitting primarily the poor . 
  but in my opinion he is much too easy on corperations and he cuts the public sector too much ( he wants to do it mainly by making stuff more effective but promises like that always come with a grain of salt even though i support the idea of making stuff more effective generally ) . 
  also right-wing is not a swearword as some people use it . 
  macron is obviously preferrable to fillon and le pen , probably even to most left wingers . 
  it is not a reflection of the usual assesment of what 's left or right . 
  if you would ask in the streets , macron would be close to center , le pen would be more right , no idea about fillon , maybe more center , melenchon perhaps as he is or maybe more to the left . 
  many of the questions in their test are also quite dubious ( and it possibly has a left-libertarian bias ) . 
  however i like their perspective a lot in that here left and right actually means something and is easily decipherable . 
  left means economic protectionism and right means economic liberalism , while autoritarian/libertarian apply to social stuff ( like legalizing weed , gay marriage , underage sex or stuff like that ) . 
  in our current political climate people throw around left and right as they see fit and it becomes completely meaningless but still discussion much too rarely extends beyond that . 
  the definition of the political compass is easy to understand and to decipher . 
  i like that they split the economic and social stuff because that 's also where politicians also have a divide often ( see macron ) . 
  generally i find it commendable and i wish we would use it more when we talk left and right instead of those arbitrary phantom pictures we always paint from it . 
  i just noticed my text on the chart does not show . 
  here is what i wrote : personally i find it quite agreeable this time around ; although i 'm surprised macron is as far to the right as libertarians . 
  i knew he went in that direction but would have expected that he has some restrictions somewhere and that overall fillon is more to the right . 
  likewise i would have expected le pen to be further to the right but they describe her as a national socialist and i also think hitler belongs a little further to the right than they place him ( though not to the far right ) . 
  but i read that the fn is split on this between a more socialist north and a more liberal south and obviously le pen does actually have quite a few leftist points in the program . 
  she 's certainly to the left of fillon and macron economically speaking but considering she promised tax cuts , i think they placed her too far to the left . 
  i very much agree with the other commentor , center is a matter of perspective . 
  you might have noticed that on the chart le pen and melenchon are also closer to the center . 
  that 's very likely not the perspective of most people . 
  good question ? 
  how far to the right is hollande economically ? 
  or perhaps the better question : what has he done in those respects ? 
  that 's definitely not true unless he plans something noone else knows about . 
  macron is probably the furthest away from a dictator , at least going by his policies . 
   most opinions i see posted on here are `` m\u00e9lenchon is anti-eu '' , or `` macron is dangerous '' or `` le pen and m\u00e9lenchon are both terrible '' . 
  that 's easy to break down actually . 
  ** melenchon ** is only anti-eu if you think his plan is to make the negotiations totally unagreeable for the eu and thus to provoke a frexit but that 's very assumptive and as far as i 'm concerned he never said anything along the lines of that . 
  it seems more likely that he 's in line with the common leftist perspective on the eu , he likes the social side of it ( e.g. 
  not going to war or generally open borders ) but he dislikes the neoliberal economic side with vastly differing economic models of countries that lead to tax haevens and outsourcing , lobbying in brussels , etc. 
  '' ** macron ** is dagerous '' i have n't really heard but he does seem very close to hollande ( who at one point had a 4 % approval rating ) , also being a former minister in hollande 's government ( economy i think ) . 
  if he 's really hollande allover again , things will probably look worse in the future and le pen could potentially really win come the next election . 
  macron has been somewhat secretive about his plans . 
  he published a programm but he 's been somewhat vague . 
  here is some sum up on what he seems to stand for ( in a somewhat order of importance ) : * tax-cuts generally speaking ( the biggest part of his programm ) * save lots of money ( in unemployment benefit , public health sector , public service modernization & local authorities spending ) * some public investments in the future ( job-training , infrastructure , energy/enviroment , health sector , modernization of public administration ) * do n't change retirement age or work hours ( a little dubious though , as he leaves the negotiations to the companies ) * slightly increasy military/police spending ( more a compromise because fillon and le pen are big on this ) * more independence for schools * subsidize acces to more culture for the young * introduce a `` buy european act '' to limit public contracts to companies with at least half their operations in europe he has outlined 6 main priorities in his program . 
  education , work , economic modernization , security , democratic renewal and international engagement . 
  you can read more here : http://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-election-macron-programme-fact-iduskbn17g19h?il=0 or here : https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-03-02/macron-unveils-program-to-cut-french-labor-costs-boost-growth as i have said , i think they put him too much on the right but his program is vague as hell . 
  some stuff i 'm actually really on board with , more independence for schools sounds incredible , subsidizing culture for the young is great ( but is n't it done a lot already ? ), 
  and i 'm also in favor of modernization and do n't necesarily mind if he wants to cut taxes according to savings in this but it 's very easy to promise and quite hard to do in practise . 
  however if he pulls it off , that 's cool obviously . 
  i do n't much like the rest and generally , he wants to change very little aside from taxation/spending . 
  on that basis you could argue for him being a libertarian . 
  are melenchon and le pen both terrible ? 
  they are both hard to predict and unprecedented . 
  ** melenchon ** has a very interestingly sounding platform . 
  from all what i 've read it sounds incredibly expansive ( he 's also been workingat it for quite some time and wrote books and all that stuff ) , building a new constitution ( the 6th republic ) with a random assembly of people , renegotiationg terms with the eu , tax increases for rich , etc. 
  and he has worked out plans for this from what i read . 
  i ca n't sum it all up but another poster posted about the eu stuff in another thread : https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/64vybf/anyone_care_to_explain_the_political_situation_in/ if it is really that bad depends on what you think the outcome will be . 
  he definitely adresses some of the key issues in the eu today , which i do n't think any of the other candidates does . 
  if his plan will lead to positive change is debatable but i would assume it would work because if france leaving the union is at stake i assume they will find some form of agreement , otherwise it 's kindergarten and other eu officials would be just as faulty as melenchon if they are unwilling to compromise . 
  as for ** le pen ** , she has her 144 points which i assume you could google ( do n't know about translation ) . 
  she wants to sharply reduce migrants , increase military/police , cut taxes , lower retirment age to 60 ( she migth have compromised on that though ) , generally not privatize , she also wants a frexit referendum ( and generally more sovereignty ) and possibly a referendum on capital punishment . 
  she wants to make france a world power ( france first ) and she wants to increase the importance of france and rebuild national identity , also by making french compete with english ( god , please not more french stuff noone wants to translate ) , she is firmly protectionist ( generally a leftist thing ) and in that she somewhat resembles melenchon but generally his voters do n't much like her , while her voters like him quite a bit . 
  that 's a 90 % income tax on everything you earn above 400k a year . 
  i know noone who earns that much and my family is probably upper middle class . 
  even lawyers and doctors do n't earn that much , not even many managers . 
  film or football stars perhaps , really rich buisness people . 
  try to look at taxes in the us under eisenhower . 
   is that adjusting for likelihood of turnout , though ? 
  yes . 
  maybe things will look different if le pen actually progresses to the next round but as off now she loses in every single poll , usually by 20 + % . 
  one recent poll against macron even has her losing by 42 % ( in the sense that she actually gets 42 % less than macron ) but that seems like an outlier . 
  the closest she got was 5 % with fillon , that 's possibly striking range , especially considering there are 2 more weeks of campaign between the first and the 2nd round of election that could mix up things a bit . 
  winning against macron or melenchon seems almost impossible . 
  while we 're at it , i 'm somewhat curious someone would downvote my above post , it 's purely analytically going by the polls numbers . 
  i did not say melenchon is likely to win , merely more likely than people might think . 
  i mean you can say that they are wrong but they are not thaat wrong : https://www.politicalcompass.org/france2017, 
   i mean is n't that what the cdu/csu is trying to do well , the cdu/csu does not have the majority in the parliament to do that and the fdp is n't in so only blaming them is really unfair . 
  if we really get this , i 'd rather blame the spd ( and maybe partly the greens ) because on paper they are against bullshit like that but in practise they are always the guys who push for stuff like the agenda or afghanistan . 
  and that 's because it 's easier for them . 
  if they do stuff like that , noone comes after them .
