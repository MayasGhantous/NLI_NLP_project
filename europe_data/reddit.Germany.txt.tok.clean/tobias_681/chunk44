   note : moderate right ( fillon ) has still the same score as m\u00e9lenchon . 
  his line is `` reducing the debt , by firing 500000 public workers , and privatizing healthcare system '' . 
  this is so stupid that it possibly puts anything going on in german politics to shame . 
   note 2 : the polls ca n't be trusted . 
  i 'm unsure if they are really that inaccurate . 
   so did the kings and queens we had before , when the subjects where in fact personal belongings of the ruler ; and thats as far conservative rightwing you have to go ; even the romans and the tribal societys of the stone age took care of their population since otherwise they might die , or run away , and you never get the house build ; social programs are not leftwing by nature ; leftwing it is if you go to make it an unchangeable and undividable human right to live , be fed and educated ... but thats not what nationalists can ever accept since the blessing of the higher birth and therefore the division of rights is in their names ; they make up blood-legacy stories with are totally similar to the old nobility trying to prove that karl the great was their ancestor . 
  well , nazis were conservative rightwingers i never said otherwise , they are however not far-right and in most countries more right-wing parties exist . 
   anarchism was from the beginning part of the liberal-sozialist movement , with the mayor differences that they did n't believed that giving power to the workers would change anything ( as we can see when we notice who is getting elected with equal voting rights ) . 
  the anarcho capitalists well ... if you talk about the european ones ; they are mostly liberal-social-democrats-who-are-not-stuck-in-19ct , while the american version called themselves libertarians and are anti-liberal-pro-monopoly-eco-darvinists who simply do n't get the good old `` blood and iron '' - logic ... if you believe them that they really believe what they say and do n't want the dictatorship of those who can afford the most guns . 
  so they are rightwing , or looneys . 
  none of this is anarcho-capitalism . 
  i get that as an idea it 's not really alive today but there is no way you can say that liberal-social-democrats are anarcho-capitalists . 
   fdp is a eco-conservtive party these days , willing to do whats necessary to protect the eco-strong from whatever ; yes thats rightwing ... but thats also anti-liberal . 
  yeah , they 've been on the conservative end lately but they are placed to the right of afd and cdu and they are not as conservative as these parties . 
   estonia , latvia , lithuania , bulgaria , romania well , they were part of the sovjet union . 
  sweden is definitely considered western , greece is the cradle of the west , finland is also mostly considered western . 
   it has the stigma of europe being no different from the us and combines anglo-saxon nations under an umbrella with the insane diversity of continental europe but somehow seems to imply all of those are just variants of the anglosphere . 
  in all honesty , i would n't mind if it fell out of use . 
  well , africa is also incredibly diverse but still european countries are much closer to other european countries or the us than to a single african country . 
  because we too often equate 3rd world with poor countries in development ( because many of them are ) . 
   especially now with the rift between the us and europe , it seems outdated . 
   in many south american countries , the west ( in cold war terms , so us-centered , not the european-centered cultural definition ) was usually associated with interventionism and right-wing dictatorships . 
  historically , people in favor of democracy had to be enemies with what you define as `` the democratic world '' . 
  yes , chile ( and salvador allende ) is a great example . 
  i did n't know about this specific instance until recently but really it 's horrible . 
  it 's scary how indifferent we still are to all the american interventionism around in the world . 
  geographically it makes no sense and in a political sense it 's somewaht understandable but still pretty dubious ( talk about oecd countries instead or something like that ) . 
  historically it bears a lot of significance and makes sense but just talking about nato would perhaps be more clear . 
  there is always a better term but it is a popular and thus important . 
  i think sanders would be center left in much of europe , in some ( eastern ) countries moderate left . 
  in some countries clinton could perhaps be considered far right , it 's a little hard to fully adapt her to europe . 
  the gop bursts our system into an unknown territory , that even the csu only sees short glimpses of in their wildest dreams . 
   like anarchist being rightwing and nazis leftwing-stuff if you set the questions right . 
  these are n't really paradoxes . 
  nazis would still be center/moderate right ( but left of cdu and fdp ) . 
  try to check the stances of the npd for instance . 
  the npd in saarland was pro bge ( supposedly because we give too much money to asylum seekers while many germans are poor - you ca n't make that stuff up ) . 
  generally nazis like social programs as long as germans are the benefitors . 
  hitler established tons of social programs to create work for people . 
  autobahn and stuff was all paid by the state and created countless jobs . 
  he was by no means a socialist though , defintely to the right . 
  anarchism is hard to define if you just say anarchism . 
  there is anarcho-capitalism which is the most right wing you get but there are also left-wing interpretations of anarchism . 
  it 's all very vague and theoretical though . 
  most of our spectrums actually define it similar to this . 
  fdp is always the most rightwing party . 
  well , hitler murdered the socialist wing , made deals with the big buisnesses and then focussed on the nationalism part ( he is by no means a socialist ) but on the political compas he would still be left of clinton , tatcher or reagan and the likes . 
   schulz would be centre-left socially and economically . 
  his campaign at least , he basicly campaigns against his parties politics of the last 20 years or so ( which was more economically right/center ) in multiple regards . 
  will he really pull through with it ? 
  `` where would you place yourself on the subject of policies regarding social values '' was hard to answer because socially i 'm incredibly liberalistic but i do n't think borders belong in that conversation and i think as long as he have nationstates like today , borders have their importance . 
  so i ended up opting for center-left , while far-left is probably closer to my actual beliefs but in practise i 'm more pragmatic . 
  i often have the feeling once i start to talk too much about anything both right and left wingers would kick me out the door but i prefer pragmatic solutions over ideologues . 
  well german is a thing in south america and mexico but i do n't feel particularly close to them . 
  the biggest film ever made in low german ( one of the most distinct and hard to understand german dialects that is also close to dutch ) comes from mexico though , stellet licht . 
  it was very strange to find that . 
  i 'm actually from the region where low german was historically spoken . 
  older people in my family can speak it but i ca n't and i think it is slowly vanishing like many dialects . 
  well , we have [ this ] ( http://ichfragmich.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/angela-merkel-und-ihrer-raute-wie-besessen-von-rauten.png ) but we do n't know what it means numerous attempts have been made at deciperhing it ike [ here ] ( https://www.tz.de/bilder/2014/01/21/3324952/799440481-raute-ahxq7zs3pa7.jpg ) or [ here ] ( http://bilder.bild.de/fotos/qf-wahlplakat_34350055_mbqf-1378477166-32287686/bild/1.bild.jpg ) otherwise the leader of our left party [ was attacked with cake during the party convention ] ( http://bilder.t-online.de/b/77/96/65/18/id_77966518/tid_da/wagenknecht-sekunden-nach-der-tortenattacke-.jpg ) we also have a lot of politicians from bavaria which are basicly walking memes - like [ horst seehofer ] ( http://ais.badische-zeitung.de/piece/03/8f/2c/d7/59714775.jpg ) who talks in a very odd manner and [ laughs a lot ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayutwxwyboi&amp;t=40 ) , also at less approriate moments , then there is also [ the guy who always stands behind seehofer ] ( http://bilder.t-online.de/b/78/95/26/42/id_78952642/517h/c_raw/tid_da/csu-chef-horst-seehofer-demonstriert-neben-dem-csu-generalsekretaer-andreas-scheuer-gute-laune-.jpg ) and [ markus s\u00f6der ] ( http://bilder.t-online.de/b/53/93/72/80/id_53937280/920/tid_da/die-kultveranstaltung-fastnacht-in-franken-in-veitshoechheim-bayerns-politprominenz-gibt-sich-muehe-bei-den-kostuemen-finanzminister-markus-soeder-kommt-als-punk-.jpg ) who puts everyone to shame when it comes to being a dickhead . 
   melenchron seems more old school left rather than this new ` centre-left/neoliberal embracing ' left we 've seen become more popular in recent times . 
  that is what i meant by new left . 
  it is a movement primarily associated with the 60 's / 70 's and i meant those more fundamentalist-left groups embracing those values that seem to reemerge in europe . 
  i do n't think the neoliberalists are left and the spd embracing stuff like that is excactly what led to the formation of linke ( which seems similar to france where people are disappointed by the socialists and opt for the more principled melenchon who seems to have definitely went past hamon by now and if melenchon gets the rest of hamon 's share he would probably win ) . 
   my only iffy feeling about him is he 's a ` soft ' eurosceptic i think that 's generally overdone . 
  as i understand it he likes the idea of the eu on paper but not the current excecution , so he 's on one side with most people there . 
  the only question is how far excactly he would go and how high his bar is for `` succesful negotiations '' . 
   i 've yet to see any english article at least on what changes he wants , so maybe someone who can read french could assist there . 
  yes , finding information in non-french is difficult . 
  hopefully some french people will respond here . 
   i think european integration is the most important aspect in europe right now because future challenges ( climate change , automation , the failures of neoliberalism , migration etc ) can only be achieved through incredibly close cooperation . 
  yes , cooperation is incredibly important right now . 
  unfortunately i think merkel disrupted a lot of the trust in the union even if that were not her intentions . 
  even though macron has a strong pro-eu rhetoric , i do n't completely trust him on this , he seems eerily similar to what the french already had in hollande , if he 's really that allover again stuff will be worse come the next election . 
  why is he controversial ? 
  i do n't think french litterature is well known outside of france . 
  i do legitimately not know the first author at all , hugo is obviously famous for les miserables , voltaire i know only as a philosopher , maupassant i have heard before but i have little idea what he wrote , louis-ferdinand c\u00e9line i have likewise never heard the only french novel i have ever read is camus ' the stranger . 
  otherwise i could distinguish proust , balzac ( mainly from watching rivette films ) , sartre , flaubert ( only for bovary ) , verne and moliere although i have n't read anything by them ( aside from small sartre snippets ) . 
  i must say i 'm very pleased that i 've seen goethe quoted in multiple of your films . 
  however is n't goethe bigger than any of your national poets ? 
  edit : i have actually read some jules verne as a kid . 
   giuseppe tomasi di lampedusa - the leopard the film is definitely a masterpiece . 
  hm ... as i 'm partly dane partly german i will do both . 
  also because denmark is really easy , they have close to no internationally well known books ( aside from h.c. anderson ) . 
  however ** denmarks ** big national epic ( which i think possibly has a similar stature there as the divine comedy in italy , faust in germany , proust in france ) , ** the fall of the king ** is amazing , it is deeply poetical but also vulgarly brutal historic fiction and a real pageturner with only 200 pages or so . 
  i certainly adore it . 
  translations do exist but i do n't know how good they are . 
  it 's certainly the most beautiful danish i 've ever read . 
  as for ** germany ** it 's a lot harder to evaluate what is well known and what is n't and it 's also so incredibly vast ( when we talk about classical litterature i think it 's much more extensive than english litterature ) . 
  i mean are goethe or schiller commonly read outside of germany ? 
  i think i 'll split it into the 3 main genres : * * poetry * : ** rilke ** and ** hoelderlin ** blow all the english poetry i 've ever read completely out of the water . 
  i have no idea if adequate translations exist but i know both have their ( small ) following in the english speaking world . 
  rilke wrote multiple poetry cycles like for instance the book of hours , which are fantastic . 
  hoelderlin wrote little and went insane pretty early but some of his individual poems are earthshakingly beautiful . 
  i completely adore `` h\u00e4lfte des lebens '' but i 'm unsure if translation could do it justice . 
  * * plays * : arthur schnitzler 's ** reigen ** ( also often known by the french name la ronde ) is something you can read in less than 2 hours , it 's based on an amazing concept , completely revolving around sex with different partners and schnitzler has a wonderful sense for the milieu of the characters and their language . 
  * * epic poetry ( i.e. 
  novels and stuff ) * : ** hermann hesse 's fairytales ** is basicly my favorite book of all time ( especially piktor 's metamorphosis i 'm completely in love with ) and it 's not very well known ( hesse himself is , sure but not this book ) . 
  i also love his ** beneath the wheel ** . 
  otherwise schnitzler 's ** traumnovelle ** which eyes wide shut is based on is incredibly short and captivating . 
  max frisch 's ** homo faber ** is likewise an incredibly fascinating novel that is still entirely contemporary ( it also has the odd distinction that the best part about it is a love story between father and daughter - with sex and all - simply because it 's such a very well written and tangible lovestory ) .
