  they 're a strange people for sure . 
  each president may only serve 2 terms . 
  yeah , i got extra irritated because i actually knew this but did n't think about it in that instance . 
   i read somewhere that east germans perform well in school and exams the statistics are rotten . 
  they 're true but misrepresentative because a lot of other factors go into it aswell . 
  the difficulty of school varies between the states ( berlin is usually said to be the easiest ) and some states are more selective . 
  bavaria is for instance supposed to have the hardest school time , still their exams are among the best - but that 's because they are the most selective about who gets to gymnasium in the first place . 
  th\u00fcringen - who is supposed to have the best exam grades in the entire country is the east german state ( besides berlin ) that generally does the best though i think . 
   but why is this not translating into jobs ? 
  is it culture ( entrepreneurism feels alien to them ) ? 
  i would assume it is translating into jobs . 
  the people who get very good exams are just not that likely to stay in east germany ( except berlin perhaps ) . 
  the problems are structural . 
  the thing is : that 's illegal . 
   also , the broken voting system makes it relatively easy for a candidate of one faction to win within the democratic party and then tank in the general election . 
  people said that about trump and the republican party aswell . 
   and it is not even only the socialist thing that could sink a candidate . 
  the democratic base contains groups that are on average very religious ( african-americans , latinos ) , so an atheist or possibly-atheist intellectual might also get problems there . 
  the people who buy that trump is a christian are idiots . 
  it 's not half as important as it is sometimes made out to be and it 's much , much more problematic for republicans , still trump won . 
  the thing is : in the end people are likely to fall in line . 
  most hardcore bernie supporters did so with hillary and trump even won against the mormon candidate in utah . 
   i hope they get their shit together . 
  but imo people should not be complacent and assume that the steaming pile of trump or imperator pence will be easily beaten by democrats in 2020 oh trust me , after their post-election performance i 'm not holding my breath . 
   please . 
  show me ** one ** negative ad  wow , ** two ** youtube ads . 
  are you satisfied if i remove one of them ? 
   no one talks about his negatives expect people on reddit which do it a lot ? 
   please . 
  show me one negative ad here are 2 ( the clinton campaign deleted the official ads but in these videos they come in after a few seconds ) ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5n5igjc1iok https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gndpevao8yk also there is something like this : http://fair.org/home/washington-post-ran-16-negative-stories-on-bernie-sanders-in-16-hours/, 
  yes , i know , i was only wondering why he got abreviations while the others did n't . 
  made him seem like some b-grade rapper . 
   why is east germany like this ? 
  is it a relic of communism sovjet socialism really . 
  a communist society looks much different than the former gdr . 
  but yes , it does come down to the aftermath of being a sovjet satelite state . 
  it 's somewhat comparable to poland ( who are not the most hospitable to imigrants either ) just that east germany has a more distinct heritage ( once being the power center of the largest military power in the world in a time when poland has ceased to exist - formally at least ) and got somewhat of a boost after being reunified with the west . 
  however like most former socialist states in europe , it 's a very homogenous society ( which makes people more suspicious towards foreigners ) that is n't very wealthy ( which does n't help hospitality either ) . 
  what is almost never spoken about is that in many ways reunification has failed because the 5 new states in germany ( which are the former gdr ) are the 5 poorest and if you put the city-state on berlin on top of that ( which is half former west and half former east germany ) , they make up the 6 statistically least happy states aswell ( they do n't do well in most statistics ) . 
  in contrast : i live in the poorest west-german state but it also bears the distinction of being the state with the happiest people . 
  now you may not consider this stat to be all that important but people do not want to live there . 
  young people move away from east germany in waves , only with a few cheap , big cities being able to attract students ( leipzig for instance is quite popular and relatively thriving ) . 
  it 's generally a teritory in regress though th\u00fcringen is doing okay and so are certain areas ( like the brandenburg area around berlin which is incredibly wealthy or the holiday resorts in mecklenburg vorpommern ) . 
  everytime i 've been there it actually was quite great though and there are a lot of things to like about it ( and even things to like about the gdr government - like the area around seas being public instead of plastered with rich peoples houses - and also the area being less urbanised ) but that 's also because where i 've been are basicly the weatlhy hotspots ( berlin , usedom , r\u00fcgen , potsdam ) . 
  the most problematic regions are mostly smaller cities . 
  in some of these areas the afd was the very biggest party , while nationally they 're set to get below 10 % . 
  i do n't think prussian pride is too big a factor . 
   two have been impeached . 
  one was clinton . 
  maybe i got confused with the wording then . 
  i meant that the impeachment was never actually followed through on as to permanently remove a president from office . 
  google gave me a faulty translation there . 
  i actually meant that no president was ever actually dismissed from office . 
  google transalted that ( amtsenthebung ) to impeachment and i was foolish enough to not follow up on it despite actually knowing that impeachment does n't mean dismissal from office ...  mike pence is slightly more popular than chris christie , and despised the most in the state he used to govern . 
  i commented elsewhere on him , but there is zero chance he could ever win an elected office at the national level beyond a tiny district in the house . 
  i 'm 100 % with you there . 
   please , tell me when someone has talked about sanders besides sanders supporters ehr , you know that he is one of 2 senators in vermont ( funnily he is the junior senator ) ? 
  he has represented these people for more than 10 years , obviously they talk about him quite a lot . 
  here are the senator approval ratings : https://morningconsult.com/july-2017-senator-rankings/ and sander 's seat in senate is a traditionally republican one . 
  last time a democrat got it was when that party was still called democrat republican . 
  still he is overwhelmingly popular . 
  i am offended pope francis did not rock this ( though pleased merkel is not # 1 ) . 
  also why do you call him russia today erdogan ? 
  i very much disagree with that . 
  red scare did n't work with corbyn either , in fact labour had their best result since 2001 . 
  likewise sanders is the most popular senator in the us and he was able to compete in an uphill battle against a candidate that was backed by almost the entire democratic establishment and deamed set already despite calling himself a socialist . 
  further america is in an increasingly desperate situation . 
  they are approaching a 2 class system and the people feel that . 
  people voted for trump because they wanted change and you doubt they 'd vote for a sanders-like candidate just because he/she claims to be a socialist while otherwise seeming reasonable and likeable - when their alternative is pence ( who is much , much worse than hillary ) ? 
  the next election will be about cahnge again and it will be like that until america finally gets its shit together ( which is n't foreseeable in the near future ) . 
  pence is a conservative . 
  he 's in a very bad position to run for change . 
  i also very much disagree with your last point . 
  i think a candidate would be surprised how far authentically proposing change could take you , it worked for trump already without being authentic in the least and with him being up against a much better candidate than pence ( and i say that as someone who thinks hillary is awful and unfit to be president ) . 
  i also like how you say the ads will sink the democratic candidate when you could hit pence so , so much harder . 
  why not try an add in [ this vein ] ( https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-urzcklhdddu/wcjilgzgp9i/aaaaaaaatmo/vmy4hmenx1ksugylzmmdwic-ewyceti_qclcb/s1600/pence%2bgays%2b2.jpg ) ? 
  however this is not how it 's going to play out . 
  the sanders faction is n't winning and they do n't have a sanders 2.0 . 
  ( your best bet is tulsi gabbard or elisabeth warren but neither of them has as much appeal as sanders and in the current climate being a woman could be disadvantageous ) . 
  currently your best bet seems to be corey booker or maybe kirsten gillibrand and in that case i feel like puking and i want hillary back ( for real , they 're both like hillary on steroids and compared to them hillary looks like a saint to me ) . 
  in that case it will also be about who got the most dirt on his opponent because none of the candidates will have any considerable propositions for the future . 
  sure , i was n't saying you need more , just that you sure make a lot of fuss about the few you do have . 
  oh yeah , i mixed that up , my bad . 
   both can fuck off while they want to do that . 
  we need neither of them . 
  polarization is excactly what the terrorists want . 
  to create lasting peace and tackle the problems of the future we actually need both of them . 
  we only need to understand that we should be the puppet of neither of them . 
  we much too often supported bullshit from the us in the past . 
   then , once trump falls into one of the dozens of bear traps he has set for himself , pence will become president and republicans and moderates in the us will rejoice at the end of the turmoil . 
  it 's genuinly hard to get impeached as president . 
  it has never happened before ( it would have with nixon though if he had n't stepped down ) . 
  i doubt it 's going to happen . 
  the republicans know they have nothing to gain because if trump gets impeached they 'll definitely loose the midways in 2018 and definitely in 2020 aswell . 
   but if pence , by virtue of not being trump , activates all of the republican base and maybe even motivates some `` moderates '' , things look very different . 
  pence is virtually unelectable and i 'm not saying that because he 's horrible but because the opposing candidate would have to be historically awful for him to even have a shot , think the worst candidate the democrats had since buchanan or so ( or if they resurect hitler ) . 
  pence speaks to a much too small fraction of the country . 
  trump actually had relatively wide support in the different parts of society . 
  despite people claiming he 's a racist , he did much better with blacks and lations than romney .
