   you frequently run into contradictions that are inescapable in life . 
  you always do that . 
  i think you misunderstood me there , i was not commenting about the sanctions , i only wanted europe to go it 's own path in the future ( be it with or without sanctions towards russia , that 's secondary and there are arguments for both sides - though the sanctions have so far not lowered putin 's popularity , which is why i would consider lifting them ) . 
  however i 'm very much against breaking existing agreements , so i do n't think breaking them in this case is the right path , no , but i was n't even talking about it in the first place . 
   who does that ? 
  especially lately . 
  both parties had not so great pr lately . 
  mostly eastern europeans who are afraid russia will invade them from my experience . 
  i can even somewhat understand them but i still think it 's a very bad strategy and that there is no way putin would invade them . 
  my hope is that with trump on one side and putin on the other , europe will be more likely to stand by itself and not by others . 
   die only right path . 
  oh germany  ... 
  i usualy despise such wording but in this case i think it 's appropriate because in this case i really think the only way is for europe to develop it 's own positions ( and the political structure to make it authentic ) , otherwise europe will end up as a playing ball between the us and china in the long run . 
   you ca n't reason with a country that completely lacks self-criticism . 
  if that was the case , putin would n't have to mind over an opposition anymore . 
  he would n't imprison or kill them in the first place if he was n't afraid of them . 
  the country is not a unified bloq . 
  of course there are russians that are very critical over the current situation but putin is very popular ( and he 's gotten more popular over the crimea invasion ) . 
  and we 're helping putin if we paint the russians as evil because then we drive them into putin 's hands . 
  putin is not in a comfortable spot . 
  if his succesor ( sometime in the future ) does not like him ( or even just pretends to not like him for pr ) , he 's a dead man ( or likely he would just flee the country ) . 
  i imagine he 's probably very afraid and he 's sitting in a position that is much more fragile than many believe ( he 's basicly reliant on russians good opinion of him ) . 
  we have nothing to win by acting agressive towards the russians . 
  sure , we have to work against what the russians do towards us but with anything we do beyond that we 're only losing and extending putin 's rule or possibly paving the way for someone worse than putin . 
  keep in mind they do actually elect their leaders ( under very dubious circumstances with lots of propaganda but the results are likely real ) and if they elected someone like putin ( who you clearly not like ) , they are very much capable of electing someone much worse but also of electing someone better . 
  we have the best cards here if we do not outright antagonize them . 
  if russia goes to war against finland , our only choice is to bomb them into anihalation ( or that 's definitely what would happen ) . 
  sadly i would not expect to survive this so i 'd very much prefer to avoid it . 
   if having a cynical leader and a corrupt caste of oligarchs is not evil first of all : try checking the probable alternatives to putin and in turn you might find out that he 's really not the worst . 
  compared to western european standards such a leader would be horrendous but by russian ( a country that never had democracy before ) standards we 're clearly not living in the worst parallel universe . 
  putin has actually gone a bit against the oligarchy , whereas jelzin ... yeah . 
  i mean i can understand why we might like jelzin better ( he was basicly just a drunk idiot ) but i can also understand why russians like putin better ( he did achieve progress in russia after the jelzin years ) . 
  i always find the construct of evil very worrysome in such cases . 
  people have to understand that something is only evil because we say it is . 
  there is no objective quantifier of good or evil anywhere and if we start to call someone evil , it 's an argumentative tactic ( that we ourself might buy fully into ) where we build a wall between us and the supposedly evil and then say : `` either me/us or him/them '' when in reality such a sharp distinction does n't exist ( or to quote star wars iii : `` only sith deal in absolutes '' ) . 
  this is purely about narrative . 
  i mean the usa invaded iraq over a false claim ( basicly nothing ) , are they evil ? 
  i certainly do n't think they are . 
  in politics everything has a reason , i 'd rather we strive to understand the reasons then call something evil . 
  we clearly have to mind our sphere of influence , we ca n't let our guard down in the face of russia as it is but this does n't mean that we have to act excessively hostile either . 
  russia is n't remotely as strong as putin makes it seem to the outside . 
  the russian military budget is out-matched 3-4 times by the eu alone ( not even speaking of america ) and putin is n't dumb . 
  he knows he has little to win over this , there 's not much he can do and i doubt there is much more he will do ( crimea only worked in the first place because it has a huge russian population and because it was gifted by khrushchev to ukraine in a manner that was actually illegal - this is of course no defense of putin 's actions but only an explanation for why it seems to work ) . 
  the point is that from a military standpoint russia is in a hopeless position . 
  if we alienate the russians , they might follow a future leader ( not putin ) into a hopeless and incredibly stupid war . 
  if we show the russian population ( not putin ) some good will and they start to see their leadership as evil ( because we have it better here ) , that 's our best hope of a peaceful transition , like with the ussr back in the day . 
  one of the problems today is that russians by into a lot of propaganda . 
  russians probably have a much more positive view of russia than germans of germany . 
  however propaganda only works if you want to believe it . 
  if russians see that we are hostile towards them , they are more likely to buy into propaganda and less likely to challenge their government in a constructive way . 
  i think currently we 're on a very wrong path . 
  the only positive signals the west is sending about russia are about putin ( look at the alt-right , putin 's their wet dream ) . 
  our actual narrative should be that we lead a better life and as russians do actually have access to a lot of data ( censorship is a big issue but still considerably better than china , iran , turkey , egypt , libya , let alone north korea ) they might come to agree with us if the narrative was more level-headed ( i.e. 
  if we stop telling them they are the bad guys and instead tell them that they are the victims of their elite ) . 
  personally i think that time is our ally . 
  if we do not escalate the situation the oppurtunity for better relations will come . 
   that countries either are fully self-deciding or not one last note to show that things are n't black and white . 
  russia is neither a working democracy nor a dictatorship , it 's a complex situation , that depending on your view i guess you could either frame as a semi-democracy or a semi-dictatorship or a semi-oligarchy . 
  we 're not winning anything by portraying russia as the big evil wolf and america as the good guys . 
  the only right path would be to develop a spine oneself for god 's sake but in recent years the eu has done a better job in destroying itself than in establishing themselves on the political map . 
  that there even is a question about wheter the usa 's increasing armament throughout the 80 's under reagan or gorbatchev 's policies were more instrumental in opening russia is ridiculous and a clear indication of propaganda . 
  many of the things you can read on here about russia , sound like people are ready to go to war with them anytime , that 's clearly no consensus in western society but i nontheless find it very worrying . 
  in germany i think the consensus is clearly that we strongly disagree with many of russia 's recent policies but that we are not willing to go to war with them , whereas the general sentiment in the west becomes increasingly hostile towards russia . 
  and what is the threat here is that if you construct such a narrative ( where russia is the big bad wolf ) over years and years , eventually people start to believe it and are more willing to go to war with russia . 
  i find that approach should be more evenhanded , where we have to put ourselves in the perspective of russia aswell and question why they are doing what they are doing and how to best achieve bilaterally peaceful realtions . 
  bilateral peace does of course include no more invasions like crimea . 
  i find currently we 're possibly destabilizing the situation . 
   the death penalty is not a violation of basic human rights in a lot of civilized countries basic human rights have nothing to do with the country . 
  the very point is that they apply to everyone , regardless of nationality . 
  besides , some of these countries might be in some conflict with their constitution over this issue : `` we hold these truths to be self-evident : that all men are created equal ; that they are endowed by their creator with certain ** unalienable rights ** ; that among these are ** life ** , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . '', 
  so i guess people who are sentenced to death are not really people . 
   that not supremacy of the military . 
  thats `` increased military spending '' . 
  something macron promised as well by the way . 
  i wrote `` sharply increase '' . 
  just about everyone wanted to raise the military budget ( do n't know about melenchon though ) but macron 's increases are relatively mild compared to le pen . 
  le pen said she wanted to boost military spending to 3 % of gdp which is close to us levels ( us is at 3,3 % , france is currently at 2,3 % - already over world average ; and for reference - germany is at 1,2 % but has less problems with terrorism - perhaps because germany was likewise less involved in destabilizing the middle east ) . 
  le pen also talked about progressively reinstating compulsory military service . 
  you 're blind if you do not see where she 's going . 
   sure . 
  because they have terror attacks every few months/weeks or a riot . 
  try to look up the situation in italy before mussolini took power . 
  noone is saying the problems are n't real but le pen instrumentalizes them . 
   same goes for all other points , but at this point nobody really cares about the term `` fascist '' anymore , i guess . 
  were in for a bright future then , i guess . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/67pc7e/the_french_communist_party_has_called_its/dgsa5dk/ ) is a list i made some time ago . 
   however , in my experience it is not out of the ordinary to meet germans in high positions who have less than satisfactory skills in english . 
  while english skills in germany are far from perfect ( they pale very much in comparison to denmark ) , according to the eurobarometer we 're 18 % above eu average in terms of being able to have a conversation in english ( and 17 % above france ) , well or maybe we 're just overconfident . 
  see [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf ) on page 23 . 
  that 's because the eu is not a country and because integration is lacking . 
  most countries in the eu could no remotely take it up with china alone and even germany has less than half their gdp . 
  but eu economy is likewise only larger if you go with ppp ? 
  well , the question is specifically about world 's leading economic power , not the largest economy . 
  still more realistic than south korea or japan tbh . 
   but economical liberalism is not a left or right thing . 
  not really . 
  certain definitions of left and right are make only that distinction . 
  economic liberalism is right-wing , whereas economic authoritarianism is left-wing . 
  and it 's certainly a considerable part of the mainstream definition aswell . 
  well , i was n't referring to ardent but i suppose the majority of germans does not know what it means , no .
