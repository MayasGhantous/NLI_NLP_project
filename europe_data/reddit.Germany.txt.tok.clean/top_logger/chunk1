this is hybrid war . 
  russia against ukraine . 
  * oh , really ? 
  why we do not see massive uneploument , environmental damage and so on in poland ? 
  on in ... choose any country from eu ... * a fighting in donetsk is not civil war . 
  existence of northern cyprus is ignored during many years . 
  pure bullshit ... * there is no civil war in ukraine . 
  * there are no 15 millions pro-russian in ukraine . 
  * if big company and industry are pure evil , why poland as a eu country is growing so fast and stable ? 
  work better , not longer . 
  i can confirm it . 
  unfortunately , germany ( and europe ) knows nothing about this russian victory . 
   i do n't know if this is true or not a democracy guarantees private property . 
  private property leads to capitalism . 
   although people also vote for things that moderate capitalism 's excesses : old age pensions , welfare , health care , civil rights laws , laws against anti-competitive behavior , etc. 
  it is normal , modern western society is built around the idea to have compromise . 
  probably the capitalism does it . 
  the problem is a democracy is n't possible without the capitalism . 
  the idea is excellent , but i feel that the implementation will be terrible if any . 
  yes , title is misleading . 
  it is absolutely crucuial , that jobs should be created in middle east, 
   russia 's current foreign policy is sort of centered around not allowing any bordering nations to join nato . 
  `` russia can go fuck itself . 
  this is none of their business . 
  if you want security and peace , you have to join nato . 
  look around , not nato countries are involved in assorted conflicts with russia : moldova , georgia , ukraine . 
  and nato countries ... 
  good point , mate . 
  ok , thanks , you are right about german police . 
  i missed the idea of the your post . 
  my post points exclusively out the shitty/bad/unlucky title . 
  read the `` human dignity '' fucking definition before posting bullshit . 
  how deportation violates human dignity ? 
  it is possible to deport a criminal with all possible respect . 
  or alternative method is to put criminals in a prison for few years and deport them after imprisonment . 
  the title is suggesting that there are good excuses for rape in the world ... also it seems , that according to `` telegraph '' a cultural difference is an excuse for some crime ( not so terrible as rape ) . 
  no , po did not change the rules . 
  even pis did not change the rules in the past . 
  i would suggest krakow ( we have an office there ), 
  the law is too soft . 
  i propose to forbid photography at all . 
  because almost every building in the world is design object . 
  almost every peace of clothing is design object . 
  every car is design object . 
  we are also design objects ( ask your parents ! ), 
  yes , its possible . 
  but what is new or interesting in using obsolete outdated os ( windows xp ) ? 
  come on . 
  they just tried to find isis for next round of bombardment !, 
  and disabled transponders help them to stay hidden for isis . 
  and will you believe people which tend to leave when shit happens ? 
  this is the problem . 
  you have no chance , my friend . 
  just for my understanding ... 
  if we have a crisis in eu ( refugee , greece , terrorism , whatever ) then cameron would leave eu . 
  but if no crisis , then cameron stays in eu . 
  nice idea , david !, 
  absolutely . 
  you mentioned correctly the reason i forgot to say about . 
  the price of the lng terminal is fully covered by lower gazprom prices not possible without the terminal . 
  btw , using `` modern '' fab-500 and `` modern '' su-24, 
  nope . 
  you are wrong and wrong badly shipment is included in the spot price . 
  * regasification ( and lng terminal of course ) * costs 0.35 $ / mcf or 0.35 $ per 1000 btu or ** 1 $ per 1 mwh ** not a big deal when price is quite approximate 8-9, 
  what russia does in syria ? 
  1000 m3 natural gas generates according to wiki 10.8 mwh 17x10 .8 x1 .1 = approximately ** 200 dollars per 1000 m3 ** . 
  are you sure that gazprom is selling natural gas such low for lithuania ? 
  i do n't believe because : in ** 2014 ** price was ** 484 per 1000 m3 ** ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-05-08/lithuania-offered-lng-cheaper-than-gazprom-natural-gas ) spot prices ** lng ** - as $ 8 per million british thermal units ( mmbtu ) , i.e. 
  not only commies . 
  stalin is beloved in russia now . 
  never . 
  sorry , but russia is ussr now . 
  you may do n't like that , bat you must live with that . 
  misleading title . 
  the law states that any international treaty may be invalidated at constitution court will . 
  better late than never . 
  so serbia is daughter of the mother-russia . 
  clear . 
  but who is the father ? 
  because not every poor man is starving . 
  i know that a lot of people in ex ussr are quite poor but they are not starving . 
  soup kitchen for 2 millions poles ? 
  doubtful . 
  i see absolutely no problems here , if pakistan or any other country refuses to get their citizens back , europe should stop to issue visas for those countries immediately . 
  - 5.6 % for poland is approximately 2,000,000 . 
  two millions in poland are starving ? 
  come on ... - `` poor people '' is not the same as `` starving people '', 
  difficult to believe in this . 
  i am visiting poland pretty often and never heard about starving . 
  this article is a bullshit . 
  update : when i tell starving i mean starving , not just poor : starving is not the same as poverty . 
  on the pictures you can see crimea and kremlin mobile tv . 
  deal done . 
  do not forget to scream `` no evidence !, 
  no evidence ! '', 
  everywhere . 
  on pictures you can see crimea with kremlin tv trucks . 
   could not like the actions of other countries , but you hate it so much , you fucking spend your time on research and commenting that would lend you a few upvotes on reddit , but will not really convince anyone , but yourself . 
  my friend , your english is so pathetic ... may be you find a little time to improve your answer a bit ? 
  to make your , no doubt , wonderful thought not so blurry and elusive .
