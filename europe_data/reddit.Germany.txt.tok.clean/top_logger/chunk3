  for everything without exception . 
  asylum-seeker has neither meldung nor ausweiss . 
  it is not possible to get reasonable money without registration . 
  and in germany any suspicious person will be reported to police literally in few days . 
  black market in germany is almost non-existent because of mini-job system . 
  and again , illegal person will be quickly reported by citizens . 
  correct , they celebrate racism in russian embassy, 
  how ? 
  in germany you can stay illegal only being on the road . 
  for everything , including job , flat , bank account you need `` meldung '' and `` ausweiss '' . 
  and germans do not tolerate people living illegally . 
  expect that you will be reported and contrary to us , for example , german police always checks your immigration status . 
  you are joking . 
  greece must keep borders safe . 
  period . 
  in germany almost impossible to stay having no legal status . 
  luxembourg is paid 142 euro per capita ? 
  come on . 
  it is bad joke . 
  it is just wonderful !, 
  just for my understanding ... 
  being in eu greece should keep borders safe . 
  this is mandatory condition for eu membership . 
  why greece ignores own duties ? 
  this looks as a typical fraud . 
  yes . 
  probably , we need a law which obligates asylum seeker lo leave european union after situation in their homeland will be normalized . 
  and make this obligation a mandatory condition to obtain asylum status . 
  free housing in germany is not possible as far as i know . 
  the article lies  under the current german rules , asylum-seekers are entitled to free shelter and some of the most generous government benefits in europe . 
  free shelter . 
  yes . 
  but this shelter is not for everybody , conditional and simply bad . 
  generous benefits ? 
  i am sorry , but asylum seeker gets nothing except roof , warm and special bones ( not money ) 100-200 + / - euro per month which may be changed in a shop for a food . 
  my friend works with asylum seeker in a camp . 
  despite common opinion , the life in germany is not easy and nobody will give money just because you are asylum-seeker . 
  i like such eu . 
  really . 
  right move , swiss . 
  why escalate ? 
  because - you were warned . 
  - you were warned twice . 
  - erdogan - turkey has a right to protect own air space . 
  confirmed by russia . 
  confirmed also one death soldier . 
  tell me about those options . 
  what do you propose ? 
  ignore airspace violation ? 
  17 seconds . 
  good reaction for such short period . 
  us and france are nato allies of turkey . 
  russia is declared itself as an enemy of nato and us ( personally ) . 
  so what reaction do you expect from enemy ( turkey ) air forces ? 
  zero . 
  but there is a chance of stopping provocation from the russia . 
  official reports from russian ministry of defense . 
  russian air forces do n't fight with isis/daesh . 
  `` we warned you : do n't fly in our air space ! '', 
  wi-fi is already fast enough theoretically . 
  in practice situation is much worse . 
  what ? 
  probably those countries had got strong russian lobby in the past when russia have a lot of money from the oil and gas , but now russia is average developing country with dead economy , terrible management and lack of the future . 
  only crazy/marginal european politic will try to tie own future with russia . 
  in less , than half year russia will begin yet another propaganda company against europe and us : `` let 's kill them all ! '', 
  and `` all europeans are gay-beasts '' . 
  ok , agree , in europe we could find many crazy politics , fortunately they are not decision makers . 
  bla-bla-bla `` let talk with russia how to kill isis '' is mandatory speech meaning `` we are nice . 
  we are estimating everything . 
  we are not racists . 
  we are open-mind '' . 
  they tried ... generators are quite expensive . 
  for generators you need oil and only reliable route for oil is through ukraine . 
  soviet government was not stupid ( may be crazy , but not stupid ) and returning crimea back to ukraine was pure economic decision . 
  well calculated decision , by the way . 
  very interesting and funny theory . 
  i suggest you to write a book about alternative history , this genre is very popular in russia . 
  probably you do nor understand even simple english . 
  just for you i emphasize my initial statement ** polling in totalitarian countries has no sense **, 
  crimea belongs to ukraine , my russian friend . 
  period . 
  are you serious ? 
  crimea was independent country approximately during 500 years crimea was part old russia during approximately 150 years . 
  crimea was part of russian federation in ussr during approximately 40 years . 
  crimea was part of ukraine during approximately 60 years . 
  crimea was populated by ukrainians and crimean tatars . 
  falsifying history - is nice statement . 
  you are russian , my friend . 
  only russians talk non-stop about falsifying history by their enemies : poles , americans , ukrainians , etc. 
  correct . 
  this is good illustration what is an opinion poll in totalitarian country . 
  yet another interesting theory . 
  you certainly should try yourself as fiction writer in genre alternative history . 
  in russia great success waits for you !, 
  who cares about polls in russia ? 
  millions of years !, 
  millions !, 
  check , please , public opinion polls in germany . 
  in ** totalitarian ** countries public opinion poll has no sense . 
  http://www.bbc.com/ukrainian/ukraine_in_russian/2015/09/150917_ru_s_crimean_tatars_blocking_roads google translates this page good enough one of the leader of crimean tatars had been arrested and sentenced .
