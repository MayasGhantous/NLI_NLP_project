  i do not understand . 
  it is not common practice to aggressively deny even possibility of a terrorist attack and run in tv non-stop programs describing metrojet as evil company , conducting searches in metrojet , interview with former crew `` how bad airplanes in metrojet '' , proposition in duma to forbid usage of old airplanes . 
  peskov , putin press secretary , told officially that terror act in the case of the a321 is ** pure speculation **, 
  during a month kremlin tried to convince people that a321 is just technical accident , because it was bad pr for putin to have russians people killed in terror attack immediately after bombing syria by russian air forces . 
  but now situation is different , and a321 crash can be bind with isis officially . 
  putin looks desperately how to break international isolation and terrorism is very good reason . 
  plane crash during a month had been explained by kremlin as a routine technical problem in very , very , very bad air company metrojet ( former kogalymavia ) . 
  what do you expect ? 
  russia supports only assad . 
  assad support only himself . 
  so answer : no . 
  in fact - two : ak and wp . 
  not counting assorted independent forces but rather very small, 
  germany and sweden can not stay alone . 
  it is impossible . 
  so mass deportation looks as inevitable . 
  not so much . 
  and you are absolutely not obligated to have private insurance . 
  according law you have to have state insurance . 
  and german state insurance is ** not ** business . 
  business is oriented on profit . 
  it is by definition of the word business . 
  krankenkassen are oriented on satisfied government requirements . 
  and nothing more . 
  russian media are propaganda by their nature . 
  their are paid by kremlin to support kremlin . 
  that 's all . 
  western media are not propaganda by the nature . 
  usual business . 
  and , please , do not tell me about russia , my young and na\u00efve friend , i know russia thousands times better then you could dream . 
  russia is normal fascists country with absolutely crazy government . 
  not . 
  give . 
  https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/gesetzliche_krankenversicherung#krankenkassen in germany most of insurance are up to so called krankenkasse . 
  it is not business at all . 
  private insurance is another story , but it is for more or less rich people, 
  you ? 
  yes , anti-putin press is trustworthy . 
  where is the problem for you ? 
  aha , you read only pro-putin press ... congratulations again, 
  and what the problem here ? 
  most of those investments go back to germany , italy , austria , etc. 
  yes , it is ** possible ** source of growth , but influence is rather moral and infrastructural, 
  still i can not understand people with base math knowledge which may believe in homeopathy . 
  it is just usual nonsense . 
  may be in germany homeopathy is kind of a tradition , something like santa klaus for adults ... 
  pfff . 
  you do not know the situation . 
  article in http://www.kp.ru/daily/26456/3327283/ pro-kremlin media , extremely popular in russia ultra-pro-putin author , well-known in russia . 
  translation of the title ** `` dreams about replacing the food imports disappeared as a smoke '' ** you may use google translate to understand how bad situation with food in russia now . 
  expensive , low quality and most important future is dark . 
  modern air defense is just sweet wet dreams of russians . 
  what do you propose ? 
  to stabilize the country with the largest nuclear stockpile in the world ? 
  sorry , but i do not believe . 
  yes , of course , i speak german . 
  now you had understood that i know situation with `` modern '' air defense in russia much better than you . 
  probably . 
  do not understand why you hate / r/ukraina . 
  are you , russians , supposed to be brothers with ukrainians ? 
  as you want , sir . 
  i was in the army and know about air defense `` a bit more '' than average man . 
  especially about soviet air defence, 
  you are kidding , my friend . 
  in fact , nobody cares about `` modern air defense '' , because there is no such thing as modern air defense in russia . 
  did you learn libya lesson ? 
  i did . 
  modern western electronic warfare overwhelm russian air defense . 
  did you learn iraq lesson ? 
  i did . 
  an air defense is destroyed at the first stage . 
  it looks a bit strange for the country which - pretends to be world leader , but not have money in budget to heat old men - exporting millions of ton oil yearly and asking for donated firewood, 
  living standards in russia ? 
  oh , really ? 
  - lack of roads in 21 century ? 
  - lack of toilets in 21 century ? 
  - lack of running water in 21 century ? 
  tell us how in russia people are asked for the ** firewood donations ** for the poor old men . 
  not so many . 
  and poles live and work in west countries . 
  what is the problem ? 
  many of them return back . 
  by the way , many germans live and work in us . 
  what is the problem ? 
  very , very , very good news for europe . 
  it is not true . 
  who cares ? 
  for eu economy food export to russia is about 0.1 - 0.01 % . 
  it is statistical error , no more for example , polish farmers had increased apple production after their apples had been banned in russia . 
  nice , yes ? 
  latin america !, 
  wow !, 
  imagine how complicated is logistic , how great is a `` quality '' and , of course , special extreme high price is guaranteed . 
  good luck , russia , good luck . 
  it is special kind of news , i.e. 
  in reality there are a lot of serious problems in russia . 
  for example , one of the latest articles in pro-kremlin ( ! ), 
  media komsomolskaya pravda by ultra-pro-putin ( ! ), 
  skoybeda states literally that `` everything is lost and we , russians , are loosing the war with western for our economical independence '', 
  as far as i recall poland is growing non-stop .
