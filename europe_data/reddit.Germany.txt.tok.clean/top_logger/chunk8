  as usually . 
  do not use facebook at all . 
  what is the problem ? 
  i have account in facebook just to have contact with some people in the future . 
  our civilisation is ever-changing . 
  culture also . 
  for example slavery was normal in 19-th century . 
  russia was western country never . 
  just accept this . 
  do you understand russian ? 
  seems not  \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0445\u0437\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0447\u0430 \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 -- \u0431\u043e\u0440\u044c\u0431\u0430 \u0441 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0435\u0439 `` historical supermission of uk is fighting with russia '' ( c ) kiselev , vesti nedeli , official kremlin propaganda channel . 
  i wrote about 21 century . 
  in 19th century definition of the west was not the same as in 21st . 
  19th century germany was a western country . 
  what is the problem ? 
  russia was always middle asian country . 
  what is the problem ? 
  do you know the history ? 
  may be you have to read some historical books ? 
   that can change . 
  nope . 
  ha-ha-ha . 
  russia is not part of the west . 
  it is official . 
  and it is the fact . 
  russia is part of middle asia . 
  russia is mortal enemy of the west . 
  and by west i mean western civilization : free market , democracy , justice , science and technology . 
  never ever . 
  russia is mortal enemy of the west . 
  as you want . 
  i speak russian and watch russian tv time to time . 
  so i know a lot about how russians hate west in common and uk especially . 
   the uk having a bad relationship with russia is in no one 's interest . 
  the uk having a bad relationship with russia is in west interest . 
  russia is enemy of the west . 
  russia hates uk : just check russian state tv . 
  ok , give me few examples auto service flat rent restaurant dinner milk eggs meat public transport i am comparing those things every month , because i have to visit our subsidiaries in poland . 
   absolutely not true . 
  oh , really ? 
  we have two offices in poland : gdansk and krakow . 
  and you tell me what is not true in poland ? 
   certain things are cheaper in poland , general living such as food , drink etc. 
  do not forget ... service costs . 
  any service . 
  flat/house . 
  difference here is not 20-30 % as for a food or drinks , 2-3 times . 
  i pay for haircut in germany 15 euro average . 
  in poland 5 euros . 
  auto service is yet another interesting point . 
  what about double/triple price for similar job in germany compared to poland ? 
  health care . 
  implant ? 
  double price . 
  medicines ? 
  often double price , even after prescription in germany . 
  i checked this many times . 
  even ikea is cheaper ... and , believe me , i do not know why . 
   clothes , electronics , and other stuff you need in your life are actually the same price you are right . 
  same price or a bit higher . 
  with very reasonable choice of really cheap goods in poland . 
   fact it 's not at all . 
  not all . 
  ergo : life standards in uk are much more high than in poland , but this difference is far to be huge . 
  i would say that difference is noticeable . 
   because comparative earnings are astronomical between ** uk * minimum * wage ** and ** polish * average * wage ** 30000 and 12000 are both average . 
  but in poland you pay in average 30 % less for literally everything . 
  `` polish average wage '' and `` uk minimum wage '' are comparable . 
  in us , for example , average salary for software developer depending from localisation varies 1 to 2.5 . 
  in bay area salaries are extremely high , but living costs are astronomical . 
   because comparative earnings are astronomical between uk minimum wage and polish average wage polish average wage is 1000 euro . 
  average wage in uk is 2500 euro . 
  oh , moment !, 
  this is an average salary , not minimum . 
  and take in account , that you have to pay in uk at least at 20-30 % more , than in poland . 
  minimum wage in uk is comparable with average wage in poland . 
  do not work with russia . 
  simple , er ? 
  in fact murdoch has very limited and indirect abilities for propaganda . 
  he must express own audience 's opinion in any case . 
  normally a press follows to public ( target audience ) opinion . 
  how cruel french police !, 
  20 000 euros per one refugee ? 
  come on !, 
  my friend works with refuge as social worker ( germany ) . 
  in fact , financially they have bare minimum to survive . 
  integration ( language courses ) are not for everybody and cost of those courses is not so high . 
  probably 21.7 billions is everything including turkey transfers , security , etc. 
  but this is price of independence from brussel !, 
  they expected staying in single goods and finance market , but leaving single job markets . 
  no way . 
  because direct answer is `` uk must leave eu single market , we have no other option '' . 
  and now just imagine consequences for the uk economy , especially finance sector and high tech industry ... p.s. 
  the answer was known before brexit . 
   french national front leader marine le pen was told to repay $ 9 million of a loan from a ** russian-based ** bank everything what you should know about `` right patriots '', 
  correct . 
  but narrowing is taught to be sexist and racist . 
  a sypu can see german police must defend narrowing ... 
  what about gender profiling ? 
  is it too sexist ?
