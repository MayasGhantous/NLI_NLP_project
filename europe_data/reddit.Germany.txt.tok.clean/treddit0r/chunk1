three things 1 . 
  low tax 2 . 
  well educated workforce 3 . 
  english speaking and in europe, 
  which can take hours , i 've had it happen several times . 
  what would it take for me to be allowed to post without you having to approve them by hand ? 
  but you block the word refugee . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/search?q=homeless&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=week what duplicate ? 
  i meant the new refugees . 
  the border checks at denmark and sweden will protect norway , they just have to stop the russians letting them in . 
  do n't worry they are n't coming to norway . 
  you would be less impressed if you were the the poor sucker like me that has to pay for it . 
  i agree you can not use 1 months figures to estimate the total for the year . 
  but you can say that the figures so far do n't support a prediction of 30 % less than last year . 
  but just just out of interest , how many do you think will come this year , if the borders remain open ? 
  the study is based on the assumption that refugees in 2016 will be down 30 % on 2015 . 
  the refugee crisis has n't affected ireland at all , in comparison to what 's going on over here in germany . 
  just be glad ye live on an island . 
  blinded by kindness ? 
  ok i trimmed a bit off the end `` the costs of the refugee crisis the german government will have to spend 50 billion euros on refugees during this year and next '' https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/43qdsf/the_costs_of_the_refugee_crisis_the_german/, 
  how did you find this post ? 
  no , the 50 billion part is the news, 
  could you rephrase it neutrally . 
  right now the rt story is the leading post on this , and nobody wants that, 
  this story was n't posted here as a `` migrant crime story '' . 
  it was posted as [ `` russia wants explanation over germany 's handling of ` teen rape ' case '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/42spvo/russia_wants_explanation_over_germanys_handling/ ) it was an international story before it appeared here . 
  it was known that she was lying at the time about being kidnapped , but nobody wanted to call her a liar as she was also the victim of sexual abuse by several older men . 
  i 'm sorry i do n't like 90 % of what i have heard from the afd , but what exactly have they done that is anti democratic ? 
  are they calling for a dictatorship ? 
  the afd are a bunch of clueless yokels , since the leadership all left last year . 
  but they are not anti-democratic or `` subversives '' . 
  definintion of macarthism : mccarthyism is the practice of making accusations of subversion or treason without proper regard for evidence . 
  it also means `` the practice of making unfair allegations or using unfair investigative techniques , especially in order to restrict dissent or political criticism . '', 
  definintion of macarthism : mccarthyism is the practice of making accusations of subversion or treason without proper regard for evidence . 
  it also means `` the practice of making unfair allegations or using unfair investigative techniques , especially in order to restrict dissent or political criticism . '', 
  mcarthyism was when the government used the fbi to investigate `` unamerican activities '' i.e. 
  anyone expressing `` communist ideas '' . 
  he is pushing for the german ` fbi ' , to investigate the afd because he thinks afd 's policies are dangerous . 
  he does n't want to argue with them he wants them blacklisted from debates and tv interviews, 
  this reminds me of [ mccarthyism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mccarthyism ) when the fbi was used to investigate anyone with `` different '' political opinions . 
  i 'm not german i just live here now . 
  i do n't think americans understand the problem . 
  for you it 's clear if someone is breaking the law and refuses to surrender , you shoot them . 
  over here we would rather the criminal gets away . 
  shot dead by police in 2014 usa : 1104 shot dead by police in 2014 germany : 7 germanys population = 25 % of usa, 
  outside of war or natural disaster the army can not be deployed inside germany ? 
  that could cause a legal problem if the government wants to use the army to control the borders this summer . 
  i agree , i think using the army , tear gas and rubber bullets should be enough . 
  it worked for [ hungary ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2015/09/21/hungary-allows-soldiers-to-shoot-at-refugees-with-rubber-bullets/ ), 
  the police union just said that they would not be shooting refugees under any circumstances . 
  so i guess that ends the discussion , unless they want to bring in the army . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35452306 as for constitutional arguments , most countries have exceptions for `` national security '' or `` marshal law '' . 
  do you know if this exists in germany ? 
   big , rich country like germany should be able to deter people at the boarder without shooting them . 
  how , because i do n't want to see anyone get shot either, 
  probably , but the refugees do n't know that . 
  so they stay out of your country . 
  `` last resort '' of course if its possible to arrest them then arrest them . 
  we are discussing when normal procedure breaks down . 
  of course no individual crossing illegal is huge threat to the security of a country . 
  neither is a thousand coming in . 
  but how many million would need to cross before you consider it a big threat . 
  i do n't want anyone to get shot . 
  i 'm a very peaceful guy . 
  but you want to just let them in ? 
  yes for some reason the refugees seem to avoid bulgaria , i think i might know [ why ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/16/afghan-refugee-shot-dead-police-turkey-enter-bulgaria ), 
  so you do n't think the police should be able to use deadly force as a last resort ? 
  what would be your suggestion ? 
  i meant warning shots , but there probably would be casualties . 
  i mean [ there already was last year ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/16/afghan-refugee-shot-dead-police-turkey-enter-bulgaria ), 
  yes , the title is like something more suited to the `` bild '' . 
  however i believe among the significant minority of people who support the afd , this is n't going to upset them . 
  several would have to , hungary already has done it . 
  malta is irrelevant , only 106 refugees in the 2015 . 
  cyprus too , the refugees know they would never leave that island . 
  spain has secure border controls , less than 4000 refugees in 2015 . 
  greece would need to be `` suspended temporarily '' from schengen . 
  tte current government does not want to secure its borders . 
  a big problem is italy , the italians would need to set up camps in sicily and keep them there . 
  not in `` prison camps '' but just not have the right to leave the island . 
  after a few months the message would sink in , that europe is closed . 
  [ source for numbers ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34131911 ), 
  context : alternative for germany ( afd ) leader frauke petry has said police should have the right to shoot illegal migrants at the border `` if necessary . '', 
  i do n't think this is about `` wanting to kill '' anybody . 
  this is about not letting a police line be overrun as happened in austria , croatia , hungary and several other places last summer . 
  instead of just letting them through , you fire a few shots and then they run away . 
  as soon as germany ** really ** enforces its border , austria will do the same , then slovenia . 
  then the german/austria borders will be reopened . 
  we would only need strict controls for a month and the crisis would be over . 
  more ? 
  yes russian media did , but here on reddit we did not . 
  the only thing new is that the ` boyfriend ' she was with , was not one of the turks that was questioned . 
   girl turned up and ** claimed ** she had been kidnapped by 3 arab men and raped . 
   police interviewed her and her story ** changed ** , that is an accurate report of what happened , also the were multiple police reports about `` consensual sex '' . 
  here is the top comment from [ when this story was posted to / r/europe ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/42spvo/russia_wants_explanation_over_germanys_handling/ ) , this is new evidence but does n't contradict what was known  to anyone unfamiliar with the story , here is what happened . 
  13 year old girl disappeared for 30 hours in berlin , there were searches and appeals made via facebook . 
  girl turned up and claimed she had been kidnapped by 3 arab men and raped . 
  police interviewed her and her story changed , police claim she was willingly with a man ( ethnicity not specified ) and they had consensual sex . 
  ( the age of consent in germany is not 13 ) the girl is russo-german , and the russians here in germany are pretty pissed . 
  the only media stories about this now are about how russia is trying to cause problems in germany .
