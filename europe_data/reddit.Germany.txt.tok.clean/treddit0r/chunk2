  can you point to any news article about a rape or any other crime , where the story came from social networks ? 
  that is what this article is claiming . 
  the german media is so dishonest it is unbelievable . 
  on the front page of dw.com is [ this story ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/refugee-a-keyword-that-gets-german-media-every-time/a-19010124 ) its lesson from this `` syrian death mistake '' is that because of cologne , journalists are now publishing stories with the word `` refugee '' earlier , without fact-checking . 
  completely ignoring the fact that this was a pro-refugee article , and the complete opposite of every other story that was covered up for weeks ( cologne , berlin rape , kiel police not prosecuting refugees ... ), 
  i just read up on turkeys '' geographical limitation '' , yes greece is screwed . 
  they would have to declare war on turkey to make them stop . 
  according to the rules the entire population of asia can walk through turkey and swim to greece , and turkey would not be obliged to take them back . 
  i think its time greece rewrote the rules . 
  i do n't think turkey will declare war on greece for returning migrants . 
  you would only have to ship back a few thousand before the turks would start to actually do something to stop them leaving . 
  turkey does n't want a war either . 
  well ship them back to turkey and let turkey not accept them . 
  and if you need to know how it could be done look at australia , not hamburg . 
  if turkey can refuse to accept them back , then greece can refuse to accept them in the first place . 
  but that is just russia being an dick , and trying to cause problems . 
  if norway can legally deport people to russia , then why ca n't greece send some pakistanis back to turkey ? 
  greece has no borders with the rest of the schengen area , so is n't its membership pretty much meaningless ? 
  does any greek here see any changes if they leave schengen ? 
  did n't norway just try to deport several thousand refugee back to russia ? 
  by that definition no crimes were committed on nye in cologne . 
  so its ok because it is normal in germany to cover-up child sex abuse . 
  parents should not worry about strangers kidnapping their kids , because if they get raped at least the neighbours wo n't find out about it in the newspapers . 
  i believe he is telling the truth about germany `` covering this up '' . 
  germany does not want any publicity about this story no matter what the truth is ( 13 year old kidnapped and raped / ran off with turkish boyfriend ) i seriously doubt lavrov cares about the girl and fully agree he is using the story for his own political ends . 
  that does n't mean it is completely false . 
  this story is no longer about the statutory rape of a girl , but about what happened afterwards . 
  http://www.swr.de/landesschau-aktuell/bw/bericht-ueber-angeblichen-missbrauch-in-berlin-konstanzer-anwalt-zeigt-journalisten-an/-/id=1622/did=16854516/nid=1622/1rsayg0/index.html thousands protested across germany , a german lawyer even sued a russian journalist for inciting hatred for covering the story . 
  german media started attacking the russian media in germany . 
  if the german police had handled this better then this minor incident would never have become an international incident . 
   if you want to follow the logic of the people who think that the police covers stuff up . 
  after cologne everybody knows that the police do cover some things up . 
  that does n't mean every story is a cover-up , but now we know * it does sometimes happen *, 
  thanks for the link , i did n't make any claims they were refugees . 
   judging from your further posts in this thread you actually put rumours without any proof over information from the police because you do n't want to believe them after cologne . 
  seriously ? 
  ok so what exactly have i said that you do n't agree with ? 
  i have tried to be fair and have waited for 8 days to comment on this story . 
   according to spiegel , there are two suspects and none of them is a refugee . 
  can you post a link ? 
  everybody agrees that statutory rape has been committed , they have a suspect . 
  would n't that suspect normally be arrested and charged ? 
  what part is not confirmed ? 
  ok maybe i should better define `` cover-up '' . 
  its a cover up in the same way the cologne incident was a cover-up . 
  no `` lies '' were told by the police , no falsification , just the police putting a certain spin on things because they do n't want to give ammunition to the right wing . 
  they just refused to answer questions about the case and denied all allegations that were made . 
  this is n't just a story about one girl , many people believe the police do not care about protecting them and their children , just about the political consequences . 
  i do n't trust lavrov at all , but here he is telling the truth . 
  `` the information was covered up for a very long time during her disappearance for some reason , '' lavrov said during the press conference in moscow . 
  this happened over a week ago , there have been protests and marches in several places in germany specifically about what happened to this girl . 
  this is probably the first you have heard about this story . 
  the only official mention of this story before now was a [ hit piece on the russia media in germany ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/opinion-german-russians-and-russian-tv/a-19003990 ) * if you doubt me , just try post this story to / r/worldnews and see what happens, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal communities really do n't like it when older foreign men prey on younger girls . 
   it 's only a drama if you make it one . 
  it is only an international incident because the german police have tried to cover it up , or at least that is what the girls family believes . 
  and of course russia is happy to make germany look bad . 
  and maybe they will prosecute , but they will keep it as quiet as they possibly can . 
  its the cover-up that really upsets me, 
  the police say they have a suspect . 
  no details on his age . 
  `` romeo laws '' cover 14-17 , [ 13 is always illegal . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ages_of_consent_in_europe#germany ), 
  in germany its common knowledge what happened . 
  you wo n't find it reported anywhere internationally , until now . 
  it really happened . 
  to anyone unfamiliar with the story , here is what happened . 
  13 year old girl disappeared for 30 hours in berlin , there were searches and appeals made via facebook . 
  girl turned up and claimed she had been kidnapped by 3 arab men and raped . 
  police interviewed her and her story changed , police claim she was willingly with a man ( ethnicity not specified ) and they had consensual sex . 
  ( the age of consent in germany is not 13 ) the girl is russo-german , and the russians here in germany are pretty pissed . 
  the only media stories about this now are about how russia is trying to cause problems in germany . 
  yes i know russia lies all the time . 
  sometimes they kill people and lie about it too . 
  but that is russia . 
  in germany we do n't expect the government to lie , to cover up a `` rape '' story because it is politically inconvenient . 
  slovenian army has 7000 soldiers . 
  3000 migrants pass through per day . 
  they close the border and within a week have over 20,000 migrants that they can not stop . 
  other countries have tried , only hungary has succeeded so far . 
  i was refering to the afd not the npd , i think they are very different . 
  in my region , which has one of the lowest unemployment levels in the country , the afd is at 11.5 unemployed tend to support die linke , 3 . 
  if you saw any of the afd marches , they have a wide age spread , i do n't know about their employment status but they seem middle class ( if very white ), 
  the germans have a long history of far right parties since the war . 
  they have been ignored for years and attempts made to ban them . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_democratic_party_of_germany its important to know they exist , so people see what a real `` neo nazi '' party is like . 
  and to be honest if they were at 10 % i would n't have a problem with people objecting to sharing a stage with them . 
  unrestricted immigration , is that a policy of the left or the right ? 
  http://www.dw.com/en/germany-has-lowest-youth-unemployment-in-eu/a-18640125 i do n't think so . 
   am i allowed to be outraged by this ? 
  no , you should have been kicked out of schengen the moment this guy got control http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/islamic-state/11459675/greeces-defence-minister-threatens-to-send-migrants-including-jihadists-to-western-europe.html, 
  yes that is very strange , i 've never heard of a party getting an 8:1 gender split like that . 
  but then again i really do n't understand german women, 
  there is a slim chance of them winning a federal state in march , if things continue to get worse for germany . 
  if carnival turns into cologne nye but nationwide . 
  why are afd dangerous ? 
  or the others in france sweden etc. 
  there are `` far right '' ( as much as afd ) in power in poland denmark , hungary and they are not risking the breakup of europe . 
  instead it is the centrist governments that opened the floodgates to the refugees , that has ended up nearly destroying the schengen agreement . 
  if afd are lying can you point out some ?
