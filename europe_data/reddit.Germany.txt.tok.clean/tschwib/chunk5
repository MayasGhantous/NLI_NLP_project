  in fact with many turkish and arab migrants and their offspring , they actively try to prevent integration . 
  there was a minor shitstorm when \u00d6zil decided to play for germany although he never even lived in turkey . 
  and you know what ? 
  okay . 
  you ca n't force them . 
  but our politicians need to accept that . 
  they wo n't integrate and if we take more , the problem will get worse . 
  that 's the point . 
  it 's pretty sad that turks do n't integrate . 
  other migrants do . 
  and all of that was pretty much obvious from that start . 
  i 'm writing this for months in different boards : if you allow people without papers into your country en masse , you lose almost all control and open yourself up for abuse . 
  no , you provoke abuse . 
  i 'm okay with taking in large numbers of refugees * if we actually make sure they are in fact fleeing from war and oppression * . 
  if you just rely on the word of the refugee , you ca n't prove anything . 
   i said many things were linked to liberalism , of which secularism is a part of . 
  the point , again , is that most of these things have a root cause , and it spans across all cultures and religions . 
  you want to make this a battle of religion . 
  it is n't and that was never my point . 
  it was yours . 
   there is more than just liberal vs not liberal and it 's not just all connected to one thing ( wealth or liberalism ) . 
   it really is n't . 
  yes , it is !, 
  the murder rate in china is lower than of the us . 
  the murder rate in many countries in south america is among the highest in the world . 
  yet china has no secularity , while south america has . 
  you just say things without any evidence really . 
   so you 're choosing not to see what you do n't want to see . 
  the map is clear . 
  not counting authoritarian regimes like iran , china , and sa , 80 % of the map is a clear correlation . 
  the only places that are poor and secular are the 6 in south america and 11 in africa , 5 of which are muslim majority . 
  also , why are you ignoring the vast majority of countries in asia ? 
  the vast , vast majority of people and countries are over there , and fuck me if it does n't match perfectly . 
  it is not correlating at all !, 
  the biggest correlation i see is between with christianity and secularity . 
  this even fits with asia . 
  the second biggest is islam and lack of secularity . 
  there is not a correlation with wealth much at all . 
  china , huge chunks of africa , south america , mongolia , russia , north africa , middle east . 
  nothing fits . 
  it * only * fits for the west . 
  we were not talking about crime and murder though but specifically about secularity . 
  why are you talking about murder , corruption or treatment of gay people ? 
  yes maybe in these cases , wealth is the deciding factor . 
  but that is a completely different topic . 
   the fact that half the lightest countries on the map in africa are over 90 % muslim ? 
  there are few outliners but it is obvious that there 's more red in the north and that the north also is where most muslims live . 
  besides , did n't you say something about exceptions do n't prove the rule ? 
   see a pattern ? 
  in the vast majority of cases , the lighter the country , the darker on the other map . 
  no , as i said above . 
  it does not fit at all for africa and south america . 
  it really only works for western nations . 
  for everything else , i see no correlation at all . 
   actually , i said the exception does not prove the rule . 
  you wrote : we both know saudi arabia is a loaded comparison . 
  its literally theocratic . 
   because it 's saudi arabia for one , and two , a ton are n't . 
  how many stories have there been of saudi princes and other rich guys throwing around cash in western countries getting drunk and high and crashing their million dollar cars ? 
  a lot . 
  saudi arabia is a lot like iran . 
  the people are often liberals and do n't really give any shits about religion , but can not disclose it due to the country 's rules . 
  this is like asking how sa can be one of the top consumers of gay porn if they 're so islamic . 
  the answer is they are n't . 
  that is not really an argument against secularism . 
  why would they , if many are not really muslim , support a theocracy ? 
   this is what im talking about . 
  what you think it `` seems like '' is subjective . 
  it is not subjective . 
  if christianity or islam correlates with or against secularism is an objective question . 
  `` seems like '' just signals that i did not analyse the data scientifically . 
  look at these three maps : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/religiousfreedom.png https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/christian_distribution.png https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e4/muslim_percent_population_v2.svg/1280px-muslim_percent_population_v2.svg.png are you really going to tell me that you see no correlation there ? 
  yes , there are outliners that are seemingly explained by communism ( different topic ) . 
  but look at africa , north and south america , europe , australia . 
  it fits for a huge number of countries . 
  it 's obvious !, 
   do the 9 secular countries in south america outweigh the many more counterexamples in africa ? 
  where are all the counter-examples in africa ? 
  look at it , it fits pretty well . 
   rich nations have less crime , less murder , less corruption , etc etc. 
  as usual on the internet , everything is tied to religion , and everything becomes islam vs christianity . 
  okay . 
  so let 's look at the map of gdp per capita : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/gdp_per_capita_ppp_world_map_2005.png it does n't fit as well at all , especially in africa and south america . 
   actually , it would be like me saying all of asia is communist , and when anyone disagrees , saying `` yeah , well why is china so communist then ? '' . 
  saudi arabia is the single go-to country of a few million everyone uses to represent a billion . 
  exceptions do n't prove rules . 
  that is not what was happeneing at all . 
  i said : islam is bad for secularism you said : acutally it 's more about wealth i said : but look at saudi arabia . 
  it is pretty rich and yet is maybe among the worst nations in terms of secularism you said : but you ca n't compare that ????? 
   source ? 
  sauda arabia literally known for having an enormous problem with poverty , and even they are n't denying it . 
  20 % of the population live in actual slums . 
  http://time.com/3679537/rich-nation-poor-people-saudi-arabia/ okay , i was wrong about that . 
  but still , why are n't the wealthy saudis secular then ? 
  what about the other rich muslim countries ? 
   id like to see anything that is n't subjective from you . 
  i think i provided arguments for that . 
  look at south america . 
  they are very christian but also very secular . 
  see here : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/christian_distribution.png and now with islam : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e4/muslim_percent_population_v2.svg/1280px-muslim_percent_population_v2.svg.png in fact , it seems like secularism and christianity have more of a positive correlation .
