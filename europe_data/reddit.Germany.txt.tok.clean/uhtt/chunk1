that does n't look too bad . 
  is that an area with a lot of german immigrants/ancestors ? 
  because when i hear oktoberfest in the us i expect a lousy bastardization , but this is pretty authentic from what i can see . 
  ( minus all the square dancing in the photo gallery ), 
  yes , there 's quite a few western themed amusement parks ( e.g. 
  [ one in the south ] ( https://www.pullmancity.de/en_us/home/ ) ) . 
  i blame it on [ karl may ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karl_may ) , he really had a big influence on the german view of the wild west . 
  i think the festivals you refer to are all karl may festivals with threatrical reenactments of his novels . 
  or at least i do n't know any other western themed festivals . 
  shooting contest against texans ? 
  cowboy reenactments ? 
  not exactly overseas , is it . 
  i 'm wondering , does that mean they 've been missing the sub since october 4th or is the ns concord a clandestine support vessel ? 
  they do n't do refueling in those ( i suppose ) high traffic areas , do they ? 
  ah ok , thanks for posting this . 
  those iss passes are very regular though , several times a day/night , and there 's three passes in my location this week that are brighter than these . 
  of course it always depends whether you 're straight under it or looking at an angle . 
  i can really recommend getting a phone app that calculates these passes for your location , ( [ android ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.runar.issdetector ) , [ apple ] ( https://itunes.apple.com/app/iss-spotter/id523486350?mt=8 ) ) . 
  you can also set alarms so you do n't miss any  . 
  seeing that white dot move over your head so quickly and knowing there 's people just 300km above you floating in space is really amazing . 
  are n't those pretty regular ? 
  what 's special about those two ? 
  ( to anybody who has n't seen it : you should go out and take a look , it 's really impressive , i 'm just wondering if this is anything special ), 
  a joke about giving up and going home coming from a french ? 
  that 's rich . 
  found the wallonian . 
  not only people in the uk vote in the * european * elections , uknow ? 
   nando 's no idea , the closest nando 's is 900km away . 
  kfc is also pretty decent quality in europe , and they try to give themselves a craft food image through their advertising . 
  the wings and chicken at kfc is much better than that at any other fast food chain i know , especially mcdonalds or bk . 
  there 's free translators all over the internet . 
  [ yeah , 38 % is really an overwhelming majority , not . 
  ] ( https://www.tagesschau.de/multimedia/bilder/crchart-1307~_v-videowebl.jpg ) [ et en france . . ] ( http://m0.libe.com/infographic/2015/07/01/38e5e2d2-aed7-4526-8ab7-e1b29675d791.svg?modified_at=1435762692 ) . 
  the population is pretty much split in the middle , i 'll give you that . 
  but constructing an overwhelming majority for either side out of this is a bit much . 
   what is 1k ? 
  a good start . 
  i have a friend with a degree in an engineering field that never used the library as well . 
  it just baffles me how he did that . 
  it means you 're an alcoholic here as well . 
  but it 's socially accepted to be a high-functioning alcoholic ( which most students are ) . 
  yeah , because they 're backed by thousands , literally . 
  i guess if there 's only the wall to the right of you , even a liberal conservative-led country looks leftist to you . 
  there is no party right of the cdu that other parties would be willing to be in a coalition with , not even the cdu . 
  cdu * is * the right wing in germany . 
  your `` right wing wins an election '' would have to mean that suddenly 50 % + of the votes would need to shift to a extreme right party that is today not even in parliament yet . 
  and that frankly wo n't happen , not in the forseeable future . 
   germany supported it aswell [ lol no . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opposition_to_the_iraq_war#official_condemnation ) do you even [ history ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/governmental_positions_on_the_iraq_war_prior_to_the_2003_invasion_of_iraq#germany ) and it 's only 12 years ago , ffs . 
  how do people forget so fast ? 
  i like how he just grouped normal and anti-immigration people together like they 're on one side , and the refugees welcome people on the other . 
   fc bayern  left-wing , antifascist hahahaha, 
  that 's a 12 ton truck , and in the other story it 's a 7.5 ton one , but that does n't matter much , because the cargo area is approximately the same , and that 's what the limiting factor is , not tonnage . 
  like i said , businesses in high-risk areas are checked often ( i.e. 
  surprise visit ) , and fines are harsh ( i.e. 
  multiples of the suspected profit ) . 
  tax inspectors do n't just rely on reports . 
  also , if you 're employing illegal immigrants for a pay that is significantly under that of legal employees , you 're opening yourself up to criminal charges of [ human trafficking for the purpose of work exploitation ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p1928 ) ( \u00a7 233 stgb ) . 
  illegally employing people ! = employing illegal immigrants that 's what i 'm trying to tell here . 
  81 people were in [ this truck ] ( http://bilder.bild.de/fotos-skaliert/in-diesem-lkw-waren-die-81-fluechtlinge-zwei-tage-eingesperrt-47176225-42218596/2,w=650,c=0.bild.jpg ) for two days and survived . 
  yeah , that 's true . 
  hot temperature speeds up decompostion . 
  and how do you know how much the bodies were decomposed , did you see any ? 
  piled up inside and already decomposing . 
  there 's still a german embassy in syria , and if they manage to make it to turkey , there 's a chance they encounter stable internet and mail services . 
  i think it 's actually a good idea and wonder why it 's not yet possible to do that . 
  `` oh hey police , i 'm the boss of $ competingbusiness , this guy is giving illegals work '' . 
  next day he has a raid , needs to pay triple his profits as a fine and gets a criminal conviction on his record . 
  other countries should know that we germans do n't fuck around when it comes to ( small time ) corruption or tax evasion . 
  you 're confusing and conflating eastern european eu citizens ( which have a right to work in any eu country ) with illegal immigrants . 
  you can de facto not get work as an illegal immigrant , i.e. 
  a non-eu citizen without a work permit . 
  the areas that are prone to schwarzarbeit like construction , farm and kitchen staff are checked regularily by the tax inspectors . 
  the bulk of schwarzarbeit is legal residents committing tax fraud . 
  [ like this ] ( http://img.welt.de/img/deutschland/crop145265876/6769404852-ci16x9-w780/online.jpg ), 
   it could be they died outside this truck and they shoved the dead bodies into the truck and abandoned it on the highway ? 
  in what scenario does that make sense ? 
  not a refrigeration truck , but a box truck of the same size , with 81 people inside ( they survived ) . 
  many of them crossed the mediterranean or aegean already , a small river is n't going to be a big problem . 
  because it means you only see as far as you can see with the naked eye from the hungarian border , not thinking that issues further away might be relevant to yourself . 
  how is that still possible in the netherlands ? 
  in germany we have life sentences , which translates to about 20 to 25 years in prison , and sicherheitsverwahrung which is a rare instruction by the judge and not technically a punishment to keep people that are deemed too dangerous for release in prison . 
  there 's about 500 persons currently in sicherheitsverwahrung . 
  but the european court of human rights has judged some time ago that keeping people locked up for actual life violates the european human rights charta , and that sicherheitsverwahrung needs a reform . 
  is there not a similar discussion about life sentences in the netherlands ? 
  i 'm german , i feed myself thankyouverymuch . 
  also i did n't write that `` close the door on your way out '' . 
  edit : to expand a little and not just be polemic : i 'm in favor of the european spirit , and i 'd like to see europe come closer together , but if the eu fails for whatever reason , i 'd be not all sad about it as i think germany will still do fine on its own . 
  but the way the eu is now ( in regards to relations with britain , as that is the topic in this comment thread ) , i think it can not continue . 
  britain is the spoiled step child of the eu , that in all situations wants some extra benefits or is just opposed on principle . 
  in my opinion this is not beneficial to a closer eu , and it would help the progression of the european spirit if britain would either drop this behaviour ( unlikely ) or leave the eu . 
  and i think i 'm speaking for many germans here . 
  a ) hold your horses , we 're talking about the uk leaving . 
  and , sorry to burst your bubble , but there 's no signs the benelux or scandinavia will leave . 
  b ) sorry to burst your second bubble , but benelux and scandinavia [ contribute rather little ] ( http://media.repro-mayr.de/10/559910.jpg ) to the eu . 
  do you understand democracy ? 
  during his term , he 's free to do as he pleases . 
  if the electors are dissatisfied they can vote him out in the next election . 
  in many countries there is also a mechanism in which the parliament can force early elections , it probably exists in italy too .
