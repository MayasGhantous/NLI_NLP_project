  how do you think , in the absence of this event , that the electors ' will is not respected ? 
   eat like a german nooooo think about all the future restaurants . 
  or d\u00f6ner - it would n't exist . 
  i think if you take this sub as a benchmark for the general european population , you 'll have a double disconnect then . 
  it 's all about the implication . 
  and that 's despicable how ? 
  i agree that if they come illegally or do n't contribute to society they should not be allowed to stay here , but most of the time i feel like the consensus is `` they 're brown , fuck them , they 're not allowed to strive for a better life . '', 
  i even unsubscribed from / r/europe because i ca n't handle all the migration threads . 
  of course it 's a challenge to us . 
  but we can and will manage it , and it 's not the end of the country as so many people ( especially brits , who are the farthest away from the issue geographically and politically ) want to make us believe . 
  i 'm also tired of ( mostly ) brits trying to explain to me what the mood is like in germany and that the germans will collectively riot if the issue is not handled the way they like ( it 's germany , look up bahnsteigkarte ) . 
  and finally it 's all the same news bites all over / r/europe 's front page again , like i need to read 15 times that the predicted number of refugees was recently adjusted by the government . 
  it just drowns out all the other interesting , diverse content from other european countries that i previously came here for . 
  / rant edit : and it 's not just that the immigration topics drown out all the other stuff , it even seeps into relatively unrelated topics as well . 
  europe stocks take a plunge ? 
  `` herp derp first sign of migrants destroying economy '' germany has a budget surplus ? 
  `` herp derp better save for all the greedy migrants '' article about birth rates in germany ? 
  `` herp derp start breeding soon or you 'll all be overrun '', 
   europe 's future will be one of endless arab and african `` refugees '' overwhelming most countries yes , because that is a military problem , right . 
  you must be pretty stupid to be confident in european military power . 
  hey , i can starve , steal , or work and risk 6 months in jail . 
  real big deterrent . 
  number what recently ? 
  brainfart , i meant basketball . 
  because everyone has been ignoring them anyway for a long time . 
  the refugees should actually at least be registered in the first country they set foot on in europe , but we all have seen the goverments in greece and macedonia actually do . 
  lol . 
  just because they do n't wear ~ ~ baseball ~ ~ basketball shorts and a an xxl sweater does n't make this high end clothing . 
  ever been to a h&m ? 
  that 's the same single border breach that i 've already seen from 5 different angles . 
  how i know ? 
  that stupid cop dropping his baton at 0:08 and otherwise being pretty ineffective is really unmistakable . 
  [ most asylum seekers in germany are not from africa . 
  [ it ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/suhl-krawalle-in-fluechtlingsheim-a-1048941.html ) is [ not ] ( http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/gewaltausbruch-in-asylbewerberheim-scherben-einer-nacht-1.2615037 ) being [ ignored . 
  ] ( http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/zeitgeschehen/2015-08/suhl-thueringen-fluechtlinge-ausschreitungen ) but what you 're doing ( to stay within your comparison ) is calling an assault a multiple homicide . 
  that 's just not true . 
  so in a purely hypothetical scenario where you could choose between a closed-borders , whites only society with shit economy where everyone is poor and an open society that welcomes immigrants where everyone 's living standard is higher than in the first case ; would you choose the first option ? 
   citing the usa as a model of natalist over immigrant policy that 's rich . 
  you know who 's going to take that money and pump out kids ? 
  low income , low education families that need the money . 
  more kids from low education families is not what the future of germany needs . 
  and clearly it works out so well the way it is now . 
  nothing should change in any direction . 
  do n't just downvote me and throw me a sentence . 
  how is that whitewashing ? 
  with the same argument ( i.e. 
  simply ignoring the definition ) you could call this a holocaust or a genocide or an intifada as well . 
  oh you 're right , it 's totally ok to rampage and throw stones and fireworks because they did not literally kill a foreigner on video . 
  did they throw stones and fireworks ? 
  did they rampage through a construction site ? 
   pogrom  a pogrom is a violent riot aimed at massacre or persecution of an ethnic or religious group , particularly one aimed at jews . 
   massacre  persecution it 's not a ) a massacre since nobody died and it 's not b ) persecution because persecution requires a position of political power of one group over the other group which refugees really do n't have . 
  i do n't see how this would be a pogrom . 
  suhl ( if that 's what the op video is ) made headlines as well , and that mod has removed the exact same parent submission [ before . ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3i46aw/raw_right_mob_vs_police_in_heidenau_germany/ ) . 
  no idea why this one got to stay . 
   have more accounts ftfy, 
  he was just assimilating to the local customs to get a feel for the people . 
  selling the car would have brought him 190000 . 
  burning the car would have brought him 240000 , but he had to pay 45000 to his accomplices . 
  195000 remain for him which means the profit from scamming the insurance vs simply selling the car is only 5000 . 
  so wait , the car had a new value of 240000 , but was currently valued at 190000 . 
  he had it burned and paid 3 accomplices 15000 each . 
  he would have gained 5000 from that scheme . 
  that guy is just monumentally stupid . 
  need altitude and/or speed for an autorotation though , neither of which he seemed to have much of . 
  also no forward speed to allow the tail fin to stabilize the aircraft . 
  do you really think he would play at shady venues ? 
  did you consider that sweden is not a single entity ? 
  sweden is many people and different people have different goals and motivations , so it 's entirely likely that the person that checked him up for weed is not the same person that invited him in the first place . 
  weed is a drug , so i do n't see what 's wrong about `` pro-drug '' . 
  \\* shoot everyone until they find a few grenades . 
  it 's like with electronics , slimmer is more expensive . 
   jews  root canals and passports  stereotype til . 
  are those newest to oldest ? 
  i imagine you wanted to buy a camel in morocco , got a passport to travel there but your girlfriend got unexpectedly pregnant and you had to find out wether it would be better to solve the problem with a combine harvester or an abortion . 
   current per liter vodka pricing you have daily prices for vodka ? 
  also , it matters if you enter the query without an asterisk or not . 
  if i search `` how much does a * cost in germany '' the results are bmw , study , live . 
  if i search `` how much does a cost in germany '' the results are prostitute , divorce , stamp , tattoo . 
  funnily if you enter it with the asterisk but remove it , the results are porsche , big mac , meal , car . 
  the results get even more diverse if you leave out the definite article . 
  `` how much does cost in germany '' results in ivf , abortion , braces , health insurance , `` how much does cost * in germany '' in gas , beer , bmw , mercedes . 
  so unless you know more about how google 's algorithm produces suggestions , these mean shit . 
  ( with that i mean that we ca n't even be sure that the most searched term in a country is at the top of the suggestions list . 
  what if there 's a big current news story in the us about kidneys in iran and it 's on the top suggestion spot for the day , but over the course of the year , much more people google the gas price rather than kidneys ) . 
  all from an unpersonalized search ( logged out ) . 
  so that means he was a ... good guy ? 
  the knife was n't in full auto , it was just an old manual knife . 
  that 's why it was less dangerous . 
  is n't iso-9001 an iso standard on how well you follow ( iso ) standards ? 
  it 's actually because tsipras never wears a tie , i think . 
  he held it up to see what it looks like . 
  there 's still 40 % who voted differently . 
  world domination with a population of 11 million ? 
  i doubt that . 
   german people , they made the reservation for the hotel at least a month before hahaha , did you mean a year before ? 
  and i 'm not even exaggerating . 
  [ are you dense ? 
  ] ( http://meatified.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/futurama-fry-not-sure-if.jpg ) it means `` this is a dutchman 's [ way of using ] grammar '', 
  seriously , it 's a irregular use of the dative case to indicate posession that is considered incorrect in standard german but common in many regional dialects .
