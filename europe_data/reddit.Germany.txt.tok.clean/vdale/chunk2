  they deny the climate change . 
  they want out of the euro and back to the dm . 
  i 'm not against the support of the ukraine army , but if we send weapons to ukraine , russia will probably just send more soldiers , tanks and weapons to vacation in ukraine . 
  the crisis ca n't be solved by military alone . 
  russia needs to pull it 's forces out of ukraine . 
   and would merkel leaving the german political sphere even change anything ? 
  merkel just represents the cdu/csu . 
  the csu might be even more strict about austerity and other policies france and the southern european states do n't like . 
  the other big party ( spd ) is now also part of the government and they pretty much agree with merkel/cdu on most things . 
  the greens ( die gr\u00fcnen ) would n't change anything if they were part of the government . 
  `` die linke '' and afd wo n't be part of the government anytime soon , because they are populist parties . 
  here are the weekly polls : http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/forsa.htm, 
   you 're saying that we should appease russia no i 'm not saying that . 
  i 'm for new/harder sanctions for example . 
  even if they do n't work in the short term , they could hurt putin 's ratings in the long term . 
  the way i see it , the relationship between europe/america and russia can only normalize after the ukraine crisis if putin is n't involved in the russian government/politics . 
  i just do n't think that new nato bases close to russia will have any positive effect , probably the opposite . 
  the only positive is that it maybe gives the baltic states a ( false ) sense of security . 
  first let me say , that i 'm not a military expert . 
  also many countries do n't act rationally when it comes to military strategy/build-up . 
  why did russia and usa build so many nukes to be able nuke the whole world multiple times during the cold war ? 
  it 's not always easy to find a rational explanation for everything , if you exclude `` provoking the other side '' . 
  russia may think that the base and the troops who are stationed there could be used for an offense or at least help a nato offense . 
  that 's what everybody thinks of the russian troops which are stationed next to ukraine , even though russia says that there are there for defensive purposes ( some of the troops already seem to be in ukraine ) . 
  maybe the baltics desire them because they do n't believe that nato would otherwise help in case of an invasion . 
  there could be many reasons . 
  right now i do n't think that the german parliament would send german to the baltics , if there is no imminent and real threat . 
  as long as russia did n't officially declare war with ukraine , there is still hope that the whole situation will be defused even though it becomes more unlikely every day . 
  i do n't think that anybody wants a new arms race or a cold war . 
  it 's not all about putting ones feelings above another one . 
  it 's above not provoking a war , not giving russia more propaganda material , etc. 
  i meant the baltics . 
  i edited my previous post . 
  in my opinion it 's a different issue . 
  all parties do n't want a war with russia . 
  many eastern european nations think that the best way to prevent a war is to build military bases next to russia . 
  germany and some other western european nation have a different opinion . 
  everybody knows that a nato base wo n't help much , if russia really decides to invade the baltics with full force . 
  merkel in riga 12 days ago : `` i want to stress that ... 
  article 5 of the nato contract - the duty to provide mutual support - is not something which just exists on paper '' it 's pretty much the same message , just more diplomatic wording . 
  the rest of the eu is hiding behind germany . 
  germany actually did more than many other countries , because they stopped a military deal which was n't part of the eu sanctions . 
  germany does n't stop other countries from imposing their own sanctions . 
  london could sanction putin 's oligarch friends who live there . 
  there is a lot of finger-pointing at germany , but what exactly did the other nations do ? 
  here is a picture of this `` complete collapse '' https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bwb03nocuaeo24g.jpg, 
  it was a 20 min interview . 
  i do n't see what 's wrong with the sentence i posted above . 
  maybe it 's because my english is n't the greatest , but in german it is n't controversial in the slightest . 
  before that she said that unification of germany happened in peace and with the acceptance of it 's neighbors and that likewise ukraine has to go it 's own way ( or `` cut it 's own path '' , do n't know which is the right translation ) and used eurasia as an example ( germany/europe would n't make a conflict out of it , if ukraine chose that path ) . 
  i thought it was more like a slight dig at russia . 
  even without the context i do n't see a problem with this sentence . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmdu_kcq5oi ( starts at 2:45 ) for everyone who understands german . 
  read the article . 
  merkel did n't say anything controversial . 
  just because pladimir_vutin 's posts are upvoted , does n't mean they 're true . 
  he even invented some stuff ( e.g. 
  `` merkel talked mostly about coming to an agreement with putin and the `` decentralization '' of ukraine '' ), 
  i live in germany and i did n't meet one person who thinks like the germans you met . 
  itt : people who just read the title and make assumptions . 
  `` diplomats say '' , `` an anonymous official says '' . 
  that 's not proof . 
  it 's also just one article . 
  even if it was used by multiple newspapers , it does n't make it true . 
  so far information from anonymous sources about germany 's ukraine policies were almost all wrong . 
  last example : a english newspaper talked about a done deal with russia a month ago to end the war , which turned out to be made-up . 
  she talked about a ceasefire in kiew , but if i remember correctly she coupled it with full ukraine control of the border and we both now that russia and the separatists wo n't do it . 
   germany has been urging ukraine to not defeat the separatists outright to avoid humiliating putin no they did n't . 
  it was just one newspaper who reported that with an anonymous sources . 
  -  bullshit  merkel talked mostly about coming to an agreement with putin and the `` decentralization '' of ukraine what ? 
  merkel agreed with poroshenko about the decentralization of ukraine . 
  where did she say anything about an agreement with putin ? 
  did i read another article than the other posters here ? 
  `` and if ukraine says we are going to the eurasian union now , the european union would never make a big conflict out of it , but would insist on a voluntary decision '' merkel did n't say she wants ukraine in the eurasian union now . 
  in my opinion she 's basically criticizing russia , because they ca n't accept ukraine 's decision to move towards the european union . 
  it 's so annoying to read / r/europe these days . 
  people love to misrepresent the position of germany here and it 's becoming a huge circle jerk . 
   ** the majority ** of nato members, 
  i do n't think so . 
  i did n't see anything about that on tv or on the biggest newspapers . 
  this reminds me of the story a couple of weeks ago that germany already had a deal with russia to end the war . 
  it turned out to be bullshit . 
  i wonder who these anonymous `` officials '' are . 
  i doubt that germany is against a humiliating defeat for pro-russian rebels . 
  it is n't widespread at all . 
  do n't believe everything you read on the internet . 
  comments on newspaper-sites are worth as much as youtube comments . 
  they do n't represent the general opinion of germans . 
  i do n't agree with your antisemitism/xenophobia/us-hate analogy . 
  it 's just weird . 
  here are some surveys of the german opinion of the us/russia/obama : * [ usa ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/database/indicator/1/country/81/ ) * [ russia ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/database/indicator/27/country/81/ ) * [ confidence in the usa president ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/database/indicator/6/country/81/ ) i think the last one shows that there is n't a general anti-us sentiment . 
  people just did n't like the iraq war and people do n't like the nsa spying . 
  germans are overall very skeptical towards putin . 
  i think you described mostly `` die linke '' voters . 
  what ? 
  she pretty much assured that the nato will protect the baltics from russian aggression . 
  `` i want to stress that article 5 of the nato contract -- the duty to provide mutual support -- is not something which just exists on paper '' . 
  i 'm pretty sure that you misinterpret something . 
  i 'm sure you know better than the experts . 
  it 's a grand coalition of a center-right and a center-left party .
