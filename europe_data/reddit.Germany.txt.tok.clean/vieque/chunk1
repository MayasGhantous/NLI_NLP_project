`` protektorat von griechenland '' would be a protectorate that belongs to greece . 
  `` protektorat griechenland '' is protectorate that is called greece . 
  correlation does n't necessarily prove causation however . 
  single parent families are just often correlated with factors that impact children negatively , like the parent having less time for them , less money and so on . 
  the single part probably is n't the actual cause . 
  honestly , `` family foundation '' already sounds like one of these bullshit groups that always rage on against gay marriage and stuff like that . 
  -- they took them to some court ( [ icsid ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_centre_for_settlement_of_investment_disputes ) ) in washington , which belongs to the world bank . 
  ** vattenfall argues that the german government with the decision to abandon atomic energy in june 2011 destroyed the value of their assets . 
  ** this concerns the vattenfall-plants in brunsb\u00fcttel und kr\u00fcmmel . 
  [ ... ] as a swedish company they invoke the investment protection guaranteed by the [ energy charter treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/energy_charter_treaty ) . 
  it protects foreign investors in the signatory countries from violations of their property rights . 
  among other things it guarantees investors `` always fair and just treatment '' . 
  -- the article mentions that german companies with investments can not do the same thing , but are seeking compensation through other means as well . 
  yeah me too . 
  `` a dinner can with you go on a boat '', 
  unless the students start to run their own public transportation services , it 's not socialism , but bulk purchase of tickets . 
  negotiating 20,000 tickets at once is what gives them the upper hand in the negotiation . 
  no , there were always states with tuition fees ( i.e. 
  pay for the privilege of going to university ) . 
  administrative fees ( sign up , payment for copies and material , etc ) , fees for public transportation and so on are not tuition and will remain in effect . 
  they are generally ~ 250-300 euro or so per semester . 
  it 's not really used anywhere as a sole plug i believe . 
  it just happens to be designed to be compatible with what was there after the fact and since ground contact varies so much between countries you ca n't have it under these criteria . 
  if you want the most compatible one outside of that you 'll have to settle for a e/f combo system ( covering everything red and dark blue on [ this map ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:europe_plugtypeinuse.png ) ) . 
  they look like [ this ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:cee_7-7.jpg ) and are very common in central europe ( probably even more so than the europlug/c-type which is really only used for small appliances due to the missing ground . 
  there already is [ a standard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europlug ) and everybody in europe supports it except a handful of countries ( including the uk ) . 
  to be fair , to germans ireland is the whole island as well i 'd say . 
  i 'd say switch to something else to spite the esperantists , but who are we kidding , 
  measuring any kind of data across internet users in general is very difficult , but if you know your bias then that helps at least . 
  so you can actually view [ demographics of people ] ( http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/uimserv.net ) who are a ) stupid enough to install the toolbar crap and b ) do n't use adblock . 
  in google chrome you can always just right click on it , then `` inspect element '' and in the html you 'll see a span-tag with a class that gives you some of the initials of the country . 
  for you it 's `` flair-alba '' or `` flair-neth '' for / u/delbertgrady92 or `` flair-germ '' for me . 
  i 'd say it 's the same with german ( and probably most other languages ) and tourists who try and speak it . 
  even if it is understandable that they might want to train their language skills , realistically nobody wants to ( or has the time to ) talk to somebody who they think will only understand every other word even after dumbing it down , especially if you can converse in their language ( or utilize english as a vehicular language ) far better . 
  i think he means the camp is n't polish . 
  i doubt that he wanted to give away the land per se , and i doubt that germany would want a random exclave in the middle of poland either . 
  it 's just dark gray and latvia and lithuania are gray as well . 
  less than 20 % maybe ? 
  maybe they did n't know those were countries ( i kid of course ) ? 
  the micro nations andorra and lichtenstein are white , so they were probably just forgotten completely in this map ( or it means was n't considered for this question like the african/asian ones ) . 
  it 's a podcast that 's really good : http://www.dancarlin.com/, 
  well if the trend continuous you 'll be not only behind us but also behind luxembourg next year . 
  i think the main argument is that `` eastern europe '' is just a common way to say `` russia 's ( former ) front yard '' , regardless of where they are geographically ( as can be seen by the first map in the album ) . 
  if you want some drama filled discussion , there 's some on the [ wikitravel talk page for europe ] ( http://wikitravel.org/en/talk:europe/hierarchy ) ( and some more on the main talk page ) . 
  i 'm surprised that somebody would be surprised by dt 's incompetence . 
  took them a week of `` try rebooting your router '' before they noticed it was on their end when i had internet trouble with them for instance . 
  that 's true , but it 's still the wrong metric . 
  it is possible for a country to exist where they do n't have laws specifically protecting lgbt groups where the crime rate is low , just as it is possible for countries to have hate crime laws and an incredibly high rate of crime against lgbt groups . 
  the correct approach would then be to measure how successful a countries policies are in preventing crime ( e.g. 
  crime rates per capita ) , not whether they have specific laws or not . 
  not sure why you got down-voted . 
  it 's probably true for the majority of the population , even if i suspect most people who hang out here on an english language forum have above average knowledge of the english language , probably in no small part due to the fact that they watch a lot of movies in english . 
  best part here in germany is even he 's just speaking with a really thick accent , but is actually talking in german . 
  then they use subtitles with ` proper german ' as well . 
  pretty much all books and films are in german in germany as well . 
  at least unless you specifically look for them , which should be the same in france ( at least i found a shelf with english books when i was on vacation there ) . 
  i mean , there 's a ton of english music being played , but i doubt that 's the deciding factor . 
  the only dubbed version i kind of like is the one from `` hogan 's heroes '' ( ein k\u00e4fig voller helden ) since they dubbed it with funny german accents that suit the stereotypes of the german characters ( fat bavarian , strict austrian , weird saxon ) , but even with that it sounds weirdly unauthentic on whole . 
  yeah , i 've had english since 3rd grade ( which i think is n't standard across germany ) , but that really was n't as useful as one might think . 
  it was so incredibly basic and covered not much more than what you 'd find in the first few chapters of a beginners book over a duration of two years ( the remainder of elementary school ) . 
  the people who are good at english here , are usually those that either spend a lot of time abroad or who use it a lot in their free time with english-language media . 
  classes in school only really got the basics across to those who did n't engage with it outside of school . 
  although the final years of high school english were pretty decent since we watched a lot of movies , read books and worked on styles , idioms and so on . 
   first of all , who will decide what threatens democracy , and thus needs to be punished ? 
  that seems like too much power for one person or entity to have . 
  that 's wrong . 
  nothing is declared a thread and punished . 
  certain things are restricted or outlawed and only those who then use it are prosecuted for it . 
  in germany the grundgesetz or basic law ( i.e. 
  constitution in everything but name ) already gives everybody unlimited freedom of speech so long as it is within the bounds of the law . 
  the symbols like swastika are prohibited because they are considered a party symbol and propaganda for parties that are outlawed ( due to not conforming to the constitution in their goals ) can not be used for propaganda purposes . 
  it 's not outlawed in most other cases . 
  there really are very few other exceptions to free speech other than libel , youth protection and conforming to some other laws in a similar vein . 
   second , if you censor free speech , it goes against the basic idea of democracy that conflicting opinions need not be censored but challenged in an open debate . 
  with all facts and both sides ' opinions presented , the public can decide what is ` right ' and ` wrong ' . 
  there is nothing more democratic than that . 
  that 's not the definition of democracy at all ( here is one : `` a system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state , typically through elected representatives . '' ) . 
  just how it usually plays out . 
  direct democracy ( everybody discusses and votes on every issue ) like that does n't exist in most countries , they vote for people to represent them . 
  in germany that 's the bundestag , and they vote on what they consider to be the right choice in these matters . 
   third , it is vital for democracy to always question and critically approach status quo , rather then defend it and uncritically maintain it . 
  you can , so long as it does n't endanger minors , uses propaganda for outlawed parties etc. 
  what you can not do is go against certain articles in the basic law , such as the fact that germany is a democratic republic . 
  you can not form a monarchist party or a party trying to implement communist dictatorship . 
  what you can do is propose a new basic law system or attempt to change it ( which requires a 66 % majority vote and happens once in a blue moon ) . 
   fourth , let 's have a little thought experiment . 
  i take a megaphone and in the brussels ' main square i announce that ` demoracy is flawed , freedom of speech needs to be abolished and all jews need to be killed . ' there are a few possible scenarios from there on : all of which are horrible straw man arguments that are really neat in theory but still really stupid . 
  here is a `` little thought experiment '' experiment ( read : straw man bs that does n't have anything to do with reality ) about unlimited free speech . 
  i call up the police and tell them i planted a bomb in a local school . 
  it 's cool though , just expressing my opinion . 
  i am called to court . 
  of course i claim he did it . 
  i do n't like his hair cut , so i want him to go to prison for something . 
  not like they can bring me up on perjury charges , it 's just my opinion that he did it . 
  allergic against peanuts ? 
  yeah our `` freshly fried peanut chips '' do n't contain any . 
  at least in my opinion they do n't . 
  sometimes i just like to yell `` fire ! '', 
  for fun . 
  oh yeah , that 's just an opinion i happen to have .
