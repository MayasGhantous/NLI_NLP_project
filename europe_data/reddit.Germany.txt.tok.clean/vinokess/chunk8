  the asylum mechanism would at first helped italy and greece which have big , big problems with the incoming people . 
  but i see , for you is solidarity a one way street which has to help only poland . 
  thank you by the way to help to nourish isis . 
  the area they control was the polish zone of responsibility during the iraq occupation . 
  you did a great job there . 
  not really . 
  france might have problems at the time and merkel did n't care so much for the german-french relations , but in principle it is a duo . 
  also , the eu is not a tool of german hegemony , but a framework to integrate german hegemony into europe . 
  imagine a world without the eu . 
  germany does as it wishes with no checks at all . 
  poland and eastern europe would be just a buffer zone or cordon sanitaire between russia and germany . 
  on your second point we can partly agree . 
  the eurozone needs a further integration to function properly . 
  if poland wants to join it or stay aside , is just its decision . 
  if this works out for the polish people will be seen as it now played out in the uk . 
  i believe that the nation states are a relict of the 19th century . 
  poland is as big as the iraq and germany as big as turkey . 
  one can play the game `` let 's all be sovereign '' , but in reality one has then to follow a bigger state and obey multiniational firms . 
  look at the statelets on the balkan : all free and sovereign without any influence from the outside and a shining example for the world . 
  also the charter of fundamental rights of the eu : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charter_of_fundamental_rights_of_the_european_union#the_british_and_polish_protocol, 
  it is n't about richer and poorer countries . 
  it is about the political will and a functioning administration . 
  the baltics , slovenia and slowakia are more integrated than poland . 
  the czech republic could integrate more if it wanted to , just as poland . 
  and you seriously think that national politics are n't influenced by big companies ? 
  on the contrary , the national governments have much less power to hold multinational companies to account if you look at apple , banks , google ... that 's the policy field which works the best in the eu . 
  if you have two buddhists instead of one , buddhism grew by 100 % . 
  it was the novemberrevolution and not the following peace `` negotiations '' . 
  scheidemann even resigned to be not obliged to sign the treaty . 
  `` dictated '' is the right word . 
  brexiters never fail to deliver what would even embarrass enoch powell . 
  the backstab myth has nothing to do with versailles , by the way . 
  germany was n't even allowed to the table . 
  i see , the brexit meetings will be fun : `` we shall fight them at the beaches ! '', 
   `` negotiated '', 
  more demand side politics , softer stance on greece , more european federalism , less anglophile and transatlantic , more continental , more coordination with france . 
  and the point being made will be that the rule of law exists in the eu while the uk is an unreliable partner . 
  good luck with your trade deals with somalia . 
  perhaps it is just sad to post an article from 2016 with comments from 2015 citing a study of an unknown institute from 2013 . 
  so you will be developing an ever increasing class willing to do anything , living in crumbled holes and working in the shadows . 
  as long as they sustain themselves , erverything is fine . 
  makes sense from an strictly capitalistic point of view . 
  if this impoverishment program is sensible though , i have my doubts . 
   ith those unable to support themselves , or earning under a certain threshold being deported . 
  so you will adopt a saudi-arabian approach of an effective slavery class which has to be steadily monitored and whose rights are bound to their means ? 
  mmhh . . 
  but then you have to look in really nasty regions to attract the people needed and to find states which are willing to cooperate . 
   the uk relies on a non.eu immigrant workforce to fulfil roles in education , health etc. 
  with your above described approach this wo n't work . 
  nobody ran this line ? 
  quite astonishing . 
  but why did n't you reduce the immigration from outside the eu if immigration is such a burning problem ? 
  you have every right to do so already , but did nothing , although it is about the same size as immigration from eu . 
  is okkupert season 2 finished in the meantime ? 
  trump demands tributes from vassals not military contributions from allies . 
  ** enemies of da peoples forced ** appenzell-innerrhoden to give wifes the unrightly right to vote on canton level in ** 1990 ** !!!!!!, 
  apart from this anecdote , without the top down decisions in the other countries , the referendum would have never gained momentum . 
  it was already at least a quarter century late , if not a half . 
  lil ' teenie sad about his karmapoints ? 
  come on , give sweetie some upvote cuddles !, 
  and in switzerland women would still have no right to vote . 
  good times !, 
  nice . 
  would not will . 
  that 's normal reasoning . 
  with independence , scotland would have the prospect of staying in the bloc ; the uk will definitely be out , unless the may government collapses . 
  so scotland would have a competitive advantage and not a level playing field as now . 
  and the workforce could surely be easier convinced to move to a country with a similar system , the same language and just some hours driving away than to move overseas to the savage continentals . 
  in bavaria are so many companies because it was the american occupation zone and most of the firms from the soviet zone moved there . 
  might be an extreme example , but the mechanism is the same . 
  you might hope that it can be held foggy , but do n't forget that there is a lot of goodwill in the eu towards scotland . 
  the chairman of the european parliament committee for foreign affairs is even half scot . 
  as long as they keep following the eu regulations , efta can be copypasted and full market access is assured for the one or two years of the formal process . 
  i 'm talking about manufacturing . 
  for small and medium suppliers it might be the easiest way to leave , given the brexit talks will break down which seems likely to me since may is already antagonizing many people and obviously ca n't bear criticism as shown by the dismissing of heseltine and the envoy to brussels . 
  she is only responding to the daily mail crowd . 
  why ? 
  it is not in scottish interest . 
  if it declares independence during the brexit process with the clear and open option to join the eu - please do n't pretend it would be otherwise , that 's a lie out of whitehall - , it could even get a boost into its new existence . 
  many firms from the untied kingdom would chooose to move to scotland to escape the isolation may is heading to . 
  you have some points regarding the general shift to the right in this election . 
  but it was n't the big earthquake as some feared especially with this erdogan show . 
  it now depends on how the trump and brexit years play out . 
  is ruthless nationalism a functioning alternative for the strong states or is n't it ? 
  my prognosis : it will be harder to get weed in the netherlands . 
  the pvv and the fvd are strong in all german border regions . 
  it 's just a live thread . 
  wow !, 
  only 3 % for the pvv among the 18-24 old . 
  but they needed seven months to vote . 
  without the pvda it seems difficult to form a coalition . 
  after this crushing , groen-links might not be too keen to get into a centre right government . 
  or do you think gl will have no problem to enter a coalition . 
  would this constellation be more left or right wing than the current government : vvd , pvda , cda , d66, 
  or because it is the easiest way . 
  you know , all these boring details about open sky , euratom , cars , banks , farmers just suck . 
  let 's build a new precious royal yacht instead which will of course rot most of the time in some harbour and jet around the world feeling important and sovereign . 
  i still ca n't make it out if they are just dumb , ideologues or malisciously erecting an outright plutocracy . 
   suitcases full of money but they have n't . 
  although the uk has an extreme low unemployment and a functioning administration , they are deep into borrowing and their health system is near the collapse .
