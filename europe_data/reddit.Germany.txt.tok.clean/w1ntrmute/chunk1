the higher amount of women in tech and management positions is more likely a legacy from communist times though . 
   i 'm just incredibly confused by this article . 
  i do n't mind a bit of schadenfreude aimed at `` german engineering '' or whatever , it 's well-deserved . 
  but what on earth does this have to do with desperate refugees ? 
  or for that matter with a terrible tragedy like the germanwings disaster ? 
  using these as a literary device to make some weird point about national character ( hint : there is no such thing ) seems singularly tasteless to me , to be honest . 
  i think this comment is on point . 
   the snake bites it 's tail . 
  how exactly ? 
   german cars are generally well engineered , but the engineering is almost entirely focused on performance , not reliability . 
  i 'd put it differently . 
  german premium cars are mechanically well engineered , but anything related to electronics is usually a recall waiting to happen . 
  it 's a country of mechanical engineers after all . 
   luxury cars may therefore fare worse in the table , as spare parts can be more expensive . 
  seems like a really shitty method of ranking reliability . 
  thanks for your intelligent input general armchair o7, 
  one trolling asshole on reddit is not really representative though . 
   there is no point to write decent comments anymore . 
  well thank god you 're still around to contribute with [ your ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3l2dwy/bulgaria_according_to_spiegelde/cv2sh96 ) [ quality ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3l5dhb/as_much_as_us_westerners_like_to_complain_about/cv3j0f5 ) [ posts ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3l5dhb/as_much_as_us_westerners_like_to_complain_about/cv3hxx9 ) . 
  thank you for your service . 
  well she is actually german , but was born in russia . 
  and yes , her music still haunts my nightmares . 
   while it 's true that eastern/ex-communist states refuse to re-think their history and quite often even discuss their guilt in many events of the past ( germans expelling from czech republic , volhynia massacre , you name it ) , germans are affected by the very opposite approach . 
  that 's an exclusively eastern european perspective . 
  and a delusional one at that . 
  hooray for boobies !, 
  i do n't think the saudis remember the ottomans that fondly . 
  they probably really hated the ottoman occupation and wanted to erase the public monument reminding them of that time . 
  the fact that i was n't is really not of importance . 
  why do you mention that war as a german foreign policy failure ? 
  i do n't think trump would settle for a simple armchair thought . 
  he 'd at least go for a golden throne . 
  you know cuz is he is * classy * . 
   -- the history bit ( lets ignore the obvious ) : thirty years war - depopulated central europe by 25 % -40 % at least . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thirty_years%27_war[1] yeah totally germany 's fault . 
  top kek . 
   but i think the german government would be hard pushed not to buy from a german weapons company . 
  that 's one of my biggest fears . 
  i do n't want the army to end up with a subpar rifle because the vendor pulled the patriotism card . 
  oh yeah i actually meant the 416 . 
  i think a couple of thousands of them were already bought for overseas operations . 
  i 'm really curious how this whole affair will play out . 
  more like hk-417 , scar or tar-21 . 
  the firearms industry must be rejoicing right now . 
  does n't spain use the g36 , too ? 
  what are their experiences with it ? 
  i mean they use the rifle under much hotter conditions than the german army . 
  i have never read anything in that regard , which really makes me wonder what is really going in our arms procurement . 
  a lot of pro-brexit people have never moved on . 
  they delude themselves into thinking that the commonwealth nations are dripping balls to finally trade with their former masters again once the yoke of brussels is shaken off . 
  i do n't think anybody wants to join a sad group of former colonial empires who think it 's still 1952 . 
  you wan na steal the azores away from portugal ? 
  why ? 
   i would vote to paddle us out into the middle of the atlantic . 
  why stop there ? 
   http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article142467577/csu-prueft-wiedereinfuehrung-von-grenzkontrollen.html[1] temporary border controls are allowed under the schengen agreement . 
   http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/europa/fluechtlinge-muessen-auf-die-ganze-eu-aufgeteilt-werden-13775633.html[2] an opinion piece which mentions how the eu commission wants to propose a quota system ? 
  that 's your evidence for germany 's infringement on national sovereignty ? 
  you must be really dense to maliciously interpret that in such a way . 
   also germany in the 90s was the sick man of europe and the money from countries like italy and france contributed a lot in making what germany is today . 
  haha good one . 
  it 's still completely wrong though . 
   threatening with exclusion from schengen zone , withdrawal from nato obligations etc. 
  i really wan na see sources for that . 
   if you have literally no money , you ca n't find ` new flats somewhere ' . 
  i do n't see how you ca n't understand that some people are dirt poor . 
  literally zilch in their bank accounts after paying for food and other essentials . 
  you do n't seem understand the german welfare state . 
  if their income is below the threshhold of the unemployment benefits , they get their rent paid by the job centre . 
  if they are working poor they can get still housing benefits . 
   if they could afford to find ` new flats somewhere ' they probably would have moved prior to destruction . 
  the report mentioned that the inhabitants of these houses are former homeless people who made this their home . 
  i think they have a sentimental value for them which influences their decision whether or not to move elsewhere . 
  you already did . 
  at least in aquitaine . 
  otto beisheim is a private university so a lot of the complains mentioned in the article wo n't apply since they stem from a lack of funding . 
  university of mannheim is a bit smaller than cologne , so i imagine it being not as bad . 
  let 's entertain that possibility for a second : in what way is that of any significance in this context ? 
   also sorry for being hostile , but your initial , now gilded comment was totally hostile and snarky too . 
  i 'm not denying its nature , but it is appropriately phrased considering the situation . 
   so i think the rebuttals you got where in line with your delivery . 
  i wholeheartedly disagree . 
  you are still beating round the bush . 
   does the fact that a citizen did not want to do the first action matter in whether they should be in favor of taking responsibility for the new problem it 's irrelevant whether they are in favour or not . 
  the government acts as an agent on their behalf . 
  when the government does have to take over responsibilites , your opinion on it does n't matter . 
  if we look at an example : the german government occupied afghanistan with the nato forces . 
  public opinion disagreement was over 90 % . 
  then an german army sergeant caused the death of a dozen of civilians . 
  do you want to tell me that any german can deny any responsibility and subsequently demand that any kind of atonement be ruled out ? 
   and your further response saying governments can claim to be the will of the people , makes no productive sense in the discussion , considering what your argument actually was . 
  he brought up the whole ` against our will ' stick . 
  i told him that legally there is little of an argument that allows one to shed responsibilities piled up by your government . 
  it does n't matter if people object morally going to war . 
  legally speaking they gave their government a mandate and the government used said mandate . 
  moral objection is not a free pass to wiggle out of responsibilities you do n't like . 
   you realize most of the eu , and especially germany , is in bed with the us as well , right ? 
  they rely on the us for intelligence they ca n't legally obtain on their own , or do n't have the resources to gather , and military power . 
  nobody denies that . 
  still germany had no part in the iraq fiasco and the ensuing rise of the is .
