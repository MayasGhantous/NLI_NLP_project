  probably . 
  the rhetoric is the same from pis first run . 
  it 's what colbert called ` truthiness ' . 
  if the facts do n't align with your retarded world view , retreat into an echo chamber of rt and blogs . 
   is there much foreign competition in german rail infrastructure ? 
   it seems like siemens , bombardier and co. have it all to themselves , like alstom and france . 
  alstom has a manufactoring plant in germany , there are also vossloh , voith and ge transportation . 
  i think the bigger problem is the incompetence and the lack of oversight and assertiveness on behalf of db 's purchasing department .

  i 'm just repeating her opinion , not my own , 
  / signed whole industries thrive on the idea of improving things and processes . 
  i think it 's time our public sector follows suit . 
   compared to other first world nations we are at the very top . 
  it 's rather that some german redditors seems to be at the very top when it comes to self-adulation and complacency . 
  where is this disposedness to accept mediocrity coming from ? 
  our internet infrastructure and mobile networks are a joke and seriously impeding economic growth . 
  traffic infrastructure needs a lot more funding and faster planning processes . 
  so there is no reason to gloat . 
  db has been in a steep decline for 2 decades . 
  all investments cut in order to make the company ready to the stock market launch that never materialised . 
  so now they are in desperate need of working train engines and carriages and get fleeced by their suppliers who deliver subpar and overpriced equipment that does n't work . 
  the only competition in the last few years the company won was about who has most discontent employees . 
  every time there is an opening at my employer , we get bombarded with engineers and technicians from db who want to leave the sinking ship .

   usa rebuilt europe somebody has a reddit account named just like that . 
  some experts on all things muslim are having trouble keeping sharia law and shakira apart . 
  it 's the tiring shakira law trope propagated by fox news and the like . 
  no need to get your knickers in a twist . 
   taking a basket of items including property , stocks , art and expensive wine , the research concluded that wealth in germany and austria jumped more than 7 percent at the end of 2015 compared to a year earlier . 
  given the low share of real estate ownership and the low amount of people doing stock trading , would n't the conclusion be that a minority here profits from the current economic climate ? 
  but i guess that does n't make for a good headline . 
  ah yes , the blog that is too dumb to spell its own name correctly . 
  great source . 
  i 'm pretty sure the participants in berlin 's gay sex orgies are all doing it voluntarily though . 
  those are mostly masters though . 
  but unis have started to create bachelors taught in english with tuition fees . 
  lots of young men with slim statistical chances to find a partner in a land that banned prostitution . 
  that does n't bode well for the future . 
  automation , industrial robotics , industrial it , chemicals & pharmaceuticals , ...

  plenty of people will gladly tell you how much they hate the banksters from the city and everything they stand for . 
  doubt it . 
  anything british-made is an instant shelf warmer . 
  because there is such a gigantic demand british insurance policies in germany . 
  so you back up your bullshit with a file by the * austrian * red cross about a family with several disabled minors ? 
  please try harder next time .

  he may be lacking in the sexiness department , but he still likes sexy time with under-age prostitutes . 
  looking at the construction boom in my city i 'd say that your wife is more of a weird outlier . 
  you should also definitely check out the [ bundeswehr military history museum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bundeswehr_military_history_museum ) in dresden . 
  it 's germany 's biggest museum and if that 's not enough for you , then there is a satellite museum in [ k\u00f6nigstein fortress ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/k\u00f6nigstein_fortress ) . 
  frankfurt sucks , the bad reputation is well deserved . 
  if you just want beer and sightseeing , then munich it is . 
  i 'd really recommend the [ deutsches museum ] ( http://www.deutsches-museum.de/index.php?id=1&amp;l=1 ) , you can easily spend a good part of a day in there . 
  our pension system . 
  the highest building in ulm is the [ ulm minster ] ( https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54005bc7e4b0cd9fe3d1a7ae/t/543d5ea0e4b07f3c0253d9f7/1411494547787/6500x1600klein.jpg ) , the tallest church in the world . 
  so i assume your dad is spanish and your mum voted to leave the eu anyway ? 
  ` usually ' does not equal ` every ' . 
  the fact that you have to bring up obscure guides does n't exactly help your point . 
  the best-selling guides from publishers like [ merian ] ( https://www.amazon.de/merian-s%c3%bcdschweden-hefte/dp/3834208159/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1474041352&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=merian+reisef%c3%bchrer ) , [ marco polo ] ( https://www.amazon.de/marco-polo-reisef%c3%bchrer-dubai-insider-tipps/dp/3829727429/ref=zg_bs_299731_18 ) and [ lonely planet ] ( https://www.amazon.de/lonely-planet-reisef%c3%bchrer-neuseeland-deutsch/dp/3829723547/ref=zg_bs_299731_14 ) follow the design i pointed out . 
  it 's not true . 
  he 's just talking out of his arse . 
  / r/thathappened [ german travel guides have usually the destination and the publisher on the frontpage . 
  most popular : krombacher has taken back the crown of germany 's best selling pilsner from oettinger . 
  while the former is a drinkable pilsner , the latter is the beer of choice for the homeless , students or cheapskates with no taste buds . 
  nekane is my favourite too . 
  can recommend anissa kate and in\u00e8s lenvin as well . 
  swap austria for australia .

  yep that 's the one . 
  the insist on calling it a fee , not a tax though . 
  the end result is still a crappy public tv compared to our neighbours . 
   munich is just full of bavarians and us tourists who thing this is the real deal . 
  it 's an overblown hick town that sells a plastic bavaria light experience to tourists . 
  by doing so it manages to be hated by actual bavarians and germans alike . 
  you learn about the differences in spelling and pronunciation and get to chose between ae and be . 
  you then have to stick to one you chose . 
  few people end up with with something that you can call british english though , the influence of american media is just to strong . 
   the map is in croatian btw :d that is some great banter . 
  thanks for the translations . 
   can translate if somebody wants to know what it says . 
  yes , please . 
  i 'm afraid you will run into trouble transfering credit points in british common law into credit points in spanish civil law . 
  these two systems do differ quite a bit , especially in regards to criminal law .

   if there is a war , and we win , who gets konigsberg back ? 
  germany or poland ? 
  it 's a shitty port city with a russian population .
