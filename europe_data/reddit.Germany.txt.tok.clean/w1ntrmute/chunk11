  the courses that i know of require a complete bsc in disciplines like mathematics , cs , engineering or a natural science . 
  turks in germany are not secular at all . 
  in addition they are highly nationalistic . 
  these aspects lead to turkish quarrels with groups like kurds and alevites . 
  during the rise of isis these turned into mass brawls which sparked the pegida protests . 
   does the name maultaschen mean something like mouth pockets/bags ? 
  it would make some sense  in today 's german it does , but actually they were invented in and named after the monastery of maulbronn . 
   do they have their own football associations ? 
  they do . 
  the dfb is the federation of 5 regional associations with 21 state associations that [ do n't always follow state borders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_football_association#/media/file:karte-dfb-regionalverb%c3%a4nde.png ) . 
  pretty weird system , but it 's older than the federal republic . 
  french police just ca n't handle the banter . 
  definitely true . 
  it 's kinda sad that for 50 years you have n't noticed that this ` rivalry ' of yours is a one-sided affair . 
  indifferent . 
  well clearly you 're not a product of australia 's number 1 tier education system . 
  ( his words , not mine . ), 
  australia lost a war against a bunch of emus . 
  just saying . 
  how about stopping with these whiny threads ? 
  we 've had enough of those and it 's getting pathetic . 
  fixed ? 
  not really . 
  how about too long ? 
  it 's only 6 more months until the campaign for 2020 begins ... 
  lads on tour ? 
  i heard minsk is nice in august . 
  it 's the reputation east germany got during the previous immigrant crisis . 
  some people there still do everything in their power to uphold it .

  if i ever had to start all over again and begin a new life , i 'd probably try bavaria , austria or the switzerland first . 
  then the scandinavian and benelux nations and the anglosphere after that . 
  this is purely based on cultural differences , languages and my personal taste . 
  when i was living a more rural area , you had to use a car to get around . 
  now that i 'm living in a city with great public transport , i do n't even own a car and mostly rely on my bicycle , trams & buses . 
  another thing that made cars a lot less relevant for city dwellers in germany : car sharing programs . 
  only shopping centres , stores or offices have ac . 
  the only apartment building around here with ac installed is actually a brothel . 
  it 's an interesting question , for me at least . 
  glad i could give some insight . 
  i 'd love to see more of this and less travel advice requests to be honest . 
  i work in manufacturing . 
  iso metric is almost used exclusively here . 
  there are rare cases where whitworth is used , for example for connecting pipes . 
  the only industry that uses american npt and other threads in inches would be the oil & gas industry , where a lot of equipment is made in the us . 
  i doubt that hardware stores around here offer a huge range of non-metric threaded screws . 
  at least i have never seen it . 
  you would have to order them from industrial suppliers . 
  companies like w\u00fcrth offer any screw or fastener that exists . 
  they mainly cater to businesses though , so ordering only a few screws could be pricey . 
  but then again , i ca n't really imagine a situation where you would use non-metric threaded screws in your home . 
  frankfurt does have a ton of hookers and drug dealers though . 
   they may be willing to take a small hit now if it means a more certain level of continued integrity of the the eu and single market . 
  they outright stated that a few days ago . 
   it took switzerland 2 years to negotiate a trade deal with china and switzerland got nothing but vague access for financial services a decade from now maybe . 
  and in return they only had to bend over and spread their checks wide to let a ton of chinese goods into their country without tariffs . 
  what a great deal . 
  2002 was one of the worst years for germany post reunification . 
  it was at that time that schr\u00f6der decided to start drastic reforms . 
  the boom in the emerging markets that ballooned germany 's exports came a few years later . 
  so much for her economic credentials . 
  and the netherlands were more than happy to join . 
  some statements and demands from dutch officials surpassed anything a bavarian csu politician would dare to say . 
  so do n't make the whole greece fiasco a sole german affair . 
  that 's the nature of century-old laws that were largely forgotten . 
  you wo n't find a state attorney willing to put a case like that in front of a judge . 
  well , good thing b\u00f6hmermann never appeared in a court room . 
  the whole case was n't even put before a judge . 
  there are plenty of stereotypes about the hand gestures , men in their twenties unable to sever the naval cord , the omnipresent catholicism etc. 
  yours is the one i 've never heard of and i doubt it 's widespread in germany . 
  that 's not a stereotype germans have about italians . 
  well there is a difference between being eligible for a passport and having one . 
  were you asked whether you were german or whether you had a german passport ? 
  plenty of brits married german women , i have yet to meet the opposite . 
  and if you see manchester 's night life , you start to realise why that is . 
  since operation seel\u00f6we failed , that 's a task unfinished i 'm afraid . 
  what problem ? 
  that we do n't teach immigration law in school ? 
   you guys have 10 types of cabbage and genocide meh , still better than having 10 types of ugly women and toast sandwiches . 
   like `` ohh you speak german so well '' , yeah no shit you clown my mother is german . 
  do n't know why this offends you so much . 
  loads of arabs , turks and other mena immigrants in germany ca n't speak proper german . 
  to the extent that people are surprised if they met one who actually does . 
   i also been asked , in the presence of my mother ( who this person knew ) , at my parents home , if i had a german passport . 
  again , why do you get bend out of shape because of that ? 
  most germans do n't know what jus sanguinis means nor do they know the details of german passport & immigration laws . 
  it 's not surprise that belgians do n't drink a beer that has the charming nickname ` wife beater ' . 
  i never doubted the legality . 
  the amount west germany paid for the occupying forces was far more than they ever received in marshall aid . 
  he 's just a troll , do n't bother . 
  what 's up with the arm chair geopolitical experts and their brain farts ? 
  like you could afford it in the first place . 
  niedersachsen is not a state with any coherent history or identity , so there is no real local pride aside from your home town . 
  but those election results did make me proud of my home state . 
   i 've never heard of anybody leaving germany for scandinavia . 
  the working conditions for medical professionals are better in scandinavia . 
  childcare too . 
  there 's a recruiting event every month in the hamburg four seasons for doctors wanting to make the move to sweden . 
  it 's well attended . 
   but the average person most likely lives better in germany than the us .
