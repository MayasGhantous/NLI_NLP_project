true ... while that dormitory is a shithole , it would look way better if they just clean it properly at the beginning . 
  wo n't fix it all , but still ... 
  one shall not mention \\ / r/polandball src : sidebar, 
  the variation is smaller than i 'd expected, 
  maybe east frisia ? 
  or implies his flair the dutch frisia ? 
  oh yes i learned about it , but fairly little . 
  it was like a single page in our history books iirc . 
  i think back then just happened too much right after the war and my history class was merged with politics so it was packed with events . 
  germans in bavaria or in the east might have more knowledge in this topic , since education is up to the states and i 'm in the west . 
  could you make a list of all episodes ? 
  like / u/taenk did for [ `` what do you know about ... 
  '' ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1g16kp/index_of_the_series_what_do_you_know_about/ ) oh and most what we learnd about the czech republic was in the cold war periode . . that in the end the west german embassy was ` occupied ' by east germans who wanted to escape the east . 
  when we learned about wwii it was mentioned for sure , but i percieved it more in a ` one of the countries between germany and russia ' way ^ ^ sorry ^ ^ for ^ ^ generalization, 
  it 's like reddit silver in real life, 
  i did n't know that , but i like it !, 
  [ here 's a pic for the lazy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0gi22a8.jpg ), 
  some countries have it , germany has the brandenburg gate on most of its [ coins ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fywoxxy.jpg ), 
  well this is strange . 
  did you tried what they suggest ? 
  i do n't work for them or such , so i ca n't really help you . 
  maybe a german ip is required , but i think they would tell you if that 's the case . 
  edit : ok i just looked it up registration is for german ips only . 
  - sorry did n't know that, 
  [ web.de ] ( https://www.web.de ) ( german ) * 1 gb mailbox * 2 gb cloud storage * google drive like apps for pc and smartphone ** edit : you can only register with a german ip address **, 
  some context : http://www.thelocal.de/politics/20130717-50919.html, 
  it 's actually kinda reassuring that the nsa did n't get so far without our governments ' knowledge/coorperation . 
  on the other side it 's even worse that they do the same, 
  this is ridicules . 
  do other countries the same shit ? 
  i 'm fine with it , i think it 's more about geography than politics . 
  also : going into too much detail may be received as douchy . 
  if you traveled france , germany and italy in your vacation , it 's shorter and less boastful to say europe when you tell your friends, 
  people underestimate the benefits of the eu . 
  it 's more than just a shared currency, 
  i like this question , it shows international stuff from different views . 
  this should really be a weekly thing . 
  edit : as i just noticed , i 'm not the first one to suggest this : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1f2r1e/whats_been_in_the_news_this_week_in_your_country/ca6ads9, 
  tbh i do n't know anything about it . 
  when i think of countries in europe , it usually end with poland/finnland in the east and greece in the south ( the back sea as imaginary border ) , though i now there are acutally more . 
  culturally/ethnically ... 
  it seems like it had some soviet influence which make it as european as i.e. 
  kazakhstan ( to me ), 
  i made a rough outline of yellowstone national park as reference : [ mapfrappe ] ( http://mapfrappe.com/?show=9613 ) [ pic for the lazy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/b3iqhgx.jpg ), 
  5 guys ; in-n-out burger edit : i know it 's not a product , but i miss it, 
  wow , good job on this post !, 
  you clearly took some effort for this well quoted contribution have an upvote, 
  got ta recognize sweden . 
  they do a lot relative to their size, 
  vienna is also the [ world 's most livable city ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world%27s_most_liveable_cities ), 
  i agree . 
  i think it 's also because they expect better chances for a permanent residency in germany . 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pq-s557xqu ), 
  your depressing way to explain everything reminds me on this campain http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jan/27/uk-immigration-romania-bulgaria-ministers, 
  your flag is really good in doing it 's job though, 
  maps + gps is only for the route . 
  the precise steering which need that kind of accuracy relies on sensors in the car itself . 
  steinbruck supported a rise for the position he was applying for ( = chancellor ) , while merkel said it was not necessary . 
  it 's nice to know that people cared enough to prevent it . 
  it 's just sad that it had to be streetview, 
   most people did n't even know how streetview actually works almost forgot about that , i 'm curious how many peopleactually knew what they are against and how many thought it would be live . 
  yeah but there were too many blurring requests for google to handle , so they gave up on it . 
  i think the argument is somewhat valid , i 'd still like to have street view here though . 
  it could have been a success if the media did n't doomed it to fail , i think 90 % of the censorships where just because people suddenly felt the need to use their rights . 
  not that it 's my opinion but one argument was that the cameras are mounted higher than a typical human is tall , so technically a 2m fence that was made to block the view would be useless . 
  google had a form where people could request a censoring of their home . 
  the germans used it ... a lot . 
  too much for google to continue , so they stopped after view cities . 
  in german ? 
  both words are more about cheering up while streicheln is more about having physical contact, 
  she used the term `` streicheln '' ( engl . 
  to pet ) , sounds really wrong to . 
  there is a support for children called ` kindergeld ' that parents get for their children . 
  i think this also applies to gay couples who adopt . 
  the thing is thought gay couples do n't get the tax relief of married couples . 
  they claim that this tax relief is also to support the creation of families and thus not for gay couples . 
  their only argument is that a hetero couples can have children and they want to support that by granting tax releases . 
  of course this a bs argument because the issue could be easily fixed by binding the support for families to the actual families and not just married couples . 
  but apparently she just does n't feel like it , ca n't argue with that . 
  i 'm sure the bild will still dig something up to blame it on immigrants, 
  right but this makes the amount of signatures only more impressive . 
  moreover i think germany and austria ( and even us ) are similar enough to allow a rough estimation like i did, 
  that 's quite a high number considering that austria has a population of 8,5 m would equal ~ 2m signatures in germany or 8m in the us, 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  not only will criminals laugh at this , it will hurt the law abiding citizen and companies . 
  it 's just maths , how can it be illegal ??? 
  that someone with his power can come up with such a shit idea makes me worry . 
   would have sold not sure if you meant that , but they * did * sell those submarines http://www.wsj.com/articles/sb10001424052748703636404575352991108208712, 
  introducing a road toll was a shit idea to begin with . 
  haha seriously though , counting family members of powerful people as powerful because of this relation is basically counting double . 
  if bo has some power over obama , it also means obama is influenced by bo and thus less powerful ( to himself , if there was no bo ), 
  at least she actually is in power and not just a wife of someone who is, 
  `` blood ____ '', 
  i really struggle to find bread that i like outside of europe . 
  it often look like it has a decent crust on display but eventually it turns out to be another toast like softie, 
  arte is the best . 
  i also like it because it 's a joint between france and germany . 
  makes me feel more connected somehow, 
  makes sense to write the language in itself , but / u/i _ repost_from_top has a point here . 
  i think a combination might work best , and since most languages are named after a country , just pick that one .
