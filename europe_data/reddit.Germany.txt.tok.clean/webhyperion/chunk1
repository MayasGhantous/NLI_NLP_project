because the prices are 5 times higher in the usa than is every other country in the world . 
  it certainly is impressive , but then the wall of china is impressive too . 
  it makes him somewhat sympathetic . 
  i appreciate our few plumbing polish friends . 
  what the hell is your point ? 
  your comment is totally unrelated to what / u/ruck _ fussia said , the only thing it does it victimizing yourself so you look like the good guy we have to pity . 
  way better writing style . 
  god , that was written horrible . 
   when i see semi sovereign i get the impression that they do n't have final say on matters . 
  that 's what you get when you are occupied , no sovereignty . 
  the case before the unification was that west germany was granted almost full sovereignty by the allied forced ( gb , france , usa ) in the `` london and paris conferences '' though the allied forces reserved themselves some certain rights where the german government had no say in . 
  these rights included that in the case of an emergency the allied forced were allowed to deploy forces in the area of the federal republic of germany and they can do what they deem necessary to resolve the emergency without the need to ask the west german government for permission to do so . 
  another thing was the control ( basically occupation ) of west berlin by the allied forces . 
  and then of course the right of surveillance of west germany including the right to place the allied intelligence services outside the boundaries of german law . 
  i said ` semi-sovereign ' not occupied . 
  actually no , since the unification of germany ( see : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_on_the_final_settlement_with_respect_to_germany ) the federal republic of germany is a full sovereign independent country . 
  before that it was only semi-sovereign . 
  nah , the authorities ignore that they violate the law and when they do n't do as told they are prosecuted . 
  i feel like this is a coworker or something . 
  me neither . 
   haha `` grachtenkacker '' !, 
  hahahah what the hell . 
  i am only 22 years old but some years ago i watched some of the `` gendarme of st.tropez '' movies on a classic tv channel and really enjoyed them . 
  i went to france last year and also visited the old gendarmerie . 
  http://i.imgur.com/yodynp5.jpg lots of people there also taking photos . 
  they are going to have a problem then , all their electricity and shit comes from ukraine . 
  how can someone like [ that ] ( http://www.barnorama.com/wp-content/galleries/01/putin/01.jpg ) be evil ? 
  they are not evil , they are just different . 
  of course germany has power in the eu , but germany is not the only one and not the one who decides what is to be done . 
  they all decide collectively . 
  because it would have been a monopoly nationally . 
  volvo and scania , both are swedish manufacturers . 
   the deal eventually failed , after the european union had disapproved of the affair , saying it would create a company with almost ** 100 % market share ** in the nordic markets . 
  it would be the same as vw taking over bmw . 
  also , you know as well as i do that it 's bullshit that germany is controlling the eu . 
  haha no , i 'm just curious because i thought of travelling there . 
  offtopic : are you really from transilvania ? 
  elections are not enough in my opinion , there are hundreds of men like yanukovitch in the ukraine and what you do n't see are the string-pullers ( oligarchs etc. ), 
  in the back hiding from the people . 
  two of the best streams in my opinion . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_lfrmcoem4 ( espreso tv ) http://ukrstream.tv/, 
  [ sa wardega ] ( http://www.youtube.com/user/wardegasa/ ) , from poland , he mostly does pranks & similar stuff i know of https://www.youtube.com/user/boarderleinnosterafu which are from germany, 
  if you visit the link / u/gedasss posted you 'll find a ranking at the bottom . 
  lower number means it 's easier to do buisness . 
  right now denmark is the best with a number of 5 , bosnia herzegovina is the worst with 131 . 
  i would like to see a source too . 
  russia will really lose its shit when they win the esc . 
  the russian invasion has begun !, 
  this is a cultural effect . 
  we are not productive for the sake of it but because we strictly separate private life from work life . 
  if you are at work you do work , no facebook , youtube or other unrelated stuff from work . 
  and on the other hand work related stuff has no place in your private life . 
  being contactable by your boss after your working hours ? 
  wont happen . 
  we also have a strict 40 hours week , a majority of people also do n't work on saturdays and sundays . 
  i assumed he meant the 1 % in spain that do not speak spanish , because of his spanish flag flair . 
  so either he is a spaniard in poland or a pole in spain . 
  what language do you speak ? 
   other circumstances this comic also falls under historic use and teaching . 
  that 's not at all what i said but okay . 
  i responded to your comment not to op . 
  freedom of speech does mean that you can say whatever you want , it does however not mean that i have to listen to what you say . 
  yeah sure , lol . 
  i recently read that one of the reasons they have been so successful in germany is because of the german dub which added `` snappy '' sayings that did not exist in the original . 
   it also means accepting that you are german , not a turk . 
  i disagree . 
  i see a great difference between nationality and ethnicity . 
  at least you 're not norway . 
  that was almost 2 months ago , see the publishing day . 
  also , this was in the news nationwide and subject of extensive criticism in germany . 
  also see this from 2014 , same school : http://www.pnp.de/region_und_lokal/stadt_und_landkreis_passau/pocking_bad_fuessing_bad_griesbach/1325279_hot-pants-zu-sexy-fuer-die-schule.html they already sort of `` banned '' hot pants etc. 
  seems like the refugees were a welcoming bogus reason to tell the parents their kids to stop wearing that stuff without putting the blame on themselves . 
  germany : http://www.euanmearns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/germany_pc_en_gdp_line.png, 
  there is no problem . 
  this problem is artificial . 
  did you even read your own article ? 
  it says he fought for the `` free syrian army '' . 
   al saleh joined the free syrian army , the moderate , western-backed forces opposing president bashar assad -- but also fighting the islamic state group and the al-qaeda affiliated nusra front . 
  you are either incapable of reading and using google or you must be deliberately creating these false titles . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_syrian_army / / edit the article he linked to : http://news.yahoo.com/syrian-rebel-leader-seeks-europe-fleeing-govt-jihadis-163636165.html, 
  probably not lgbt but a peace flag . 
  https://duckduckgo.com/?q=peace+flag&amp;ia=images we do n't even know what was written on the flag . 
  of course there is bias . 
  germany is not helping russia , only german companies are . 
  and these are even not in the majority . 
   gazprom , e.on , basf/wintershall , omv , engie and royal dutch shell formed the new consortium for the project , a spokesman for the consortium said on friday . 
  e.on - german basf/wintershall - german so 1/3 of that consortium are only german companies . 
  just because you are against immigration does not make you racist . 
  calling people you disagree with racists is really not the way to go . 
  that was forseeable . 
  he did poker and lost . 
  people want stability and security and that 's not exactly what his party stands for and that also is not , what they did this year . 
  and in the 60s they said they do not intend to build a wall !, 
  10 years later the gdr was a prison . 
  i have seen a lot of anti-immigration posts . 
  but i think you 're making it yourself too easy by simply calling them racists . 
  by that you 're ignoring the fears and worries these people have . 
  in the end this is only solvable when you openly confront these people with arguments even they will understand . 
  in my understanding open and bold racism should be bannable . 
  but you 'd have to draw the line somewhere , making it transparent what being openly racist means .
