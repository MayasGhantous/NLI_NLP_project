  imho things that harm this subreddits wellbeing should not be welcomed here . 
  most likely an exchange student . 
  if i befriend him i will have won the fight . 
  well said my friend . 
  just watch this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucjl53x4tx0, 
   how often are you on reddit in an average week ? 
  everyday , several times a day . 
  first time during breakfast , during the day mostly with phone and when i come home i check reddit for all i missed and possibly answer posts that i was too lazy to answer to on my phone because i do n't like to write long texts on it . 
  so about 2-4 hours a day . 
   how often do you visit / r/europe ? 
  / r/europe is , with a few other subs , what i visit first when opening reddit . 
  i have it on my shortcut-list in res . 
   what country are you normally resident in ? 
  germany . 
   do you speak any languages besides english ? 
  ( if yes : which and to what level ? ), 
  beside english nothing . 
  i had some spanish in school but was terrible in it , i had no desire and motivation to learn it . 
  some of the few bits of spanish i still know . 
    what interests you about europe ? 
  i 'd like to see what other countries have to offer in regards of their culture , but for that to fully see you 'd have to visit them to experience it . 
  i am also interested in the inner working of the european union , so to speak politics . 
  it also fascinates me how we managed to live so peacefully for more than 70 years ( beside some smaller troubles ) . 
   what are your favourite and least favourite things about / r/europe ? 
  my favorite thing is that you see all the different perspectives from all the different people . 
  where else could you ask a greek and a brit what they think about the bailout . 
  least favorite is probably that / r/europe can sometimes be very one-sided on some topics . 
   do you have experience as a moderator or similar ? 
  i have created my own fun-sub / r/windrad . 
  beside that i do n't have much experience moderating on reddit . 
  in the past i had some positions on other websites and communities where i had powers similar to moderation on reddit . 
  for one year around 2009 i was a gamemaster in a private world of warcraft server with about 1000 concurrent players daily . 
  i quit after a year because i did n't want to play wow anymore and thus could n't do my duties . 
  at the end of 2010 i was accepted as an admin for the call of duty 4 league in the 4players liga . 
  i was expecting something else from the work as an admin there , and the league itself did n't have much to none activity . 
  so i left after half a year . 
  the 4players liga closed down in 2013 . 
  beginning of 2012 a few friends and i founded our own battlefield 3 clan with about 20-40 members . 
  i was appointed to maintain the website a bit , more about organisation and content than actually coding something . 
  i also was an admin in our own teamspeak . 
  over the course of 2 years most of us went inactive in bf3 and the clan slowly died . 
   why do you want to be a moderator ? 
  / r/europe is one of my favorite subreddits and it would really bother me if it would burn to the ground . 
  i want to help make this subreddit great . 
   why do you think you would be a good moderator ? 
  i have the necessary skills and qualifications to be a good moderator . 
  i also have the time to do what is necessary , as i am currently studying at university . 
  i am thoughtful and reasonable . 
  i 'd like to approach things from an objective point of view , get information from different sources and then proceed to see what fits objectively best . 
  friends would also say that i am very loyal and thoughtful . 
   do you have any experience with statistics , data mining or reddit bots ? 
  unfortunately no . 
   what is your opinion on the immigration megathread ? 
  what do you think went wrong ( if anything ) ? 
  the megathreads felt like a forced conversation . 
  frankly i think the only thing they did was limit the discussion happening on immigration , everything surrounding them was also very unclear . 
  people felt like they 're being censored on the biggest topic in europe right now . 
  to create a new one every few days also was n't the best idea i guess . 
  i think the mods had the right idea but the wrong approach . 
  you do n't want to see the front page of / r/europe filled with threads about immigration and refugees , after all this is not / r/immigration . 
  but then again immigration is a large topic in europe right now and maybe that warrants that the frontpage is filled with it . 
  ultimately i think there is no good solution to it , we should let the user base of / r/europe decide what should be on the front page and the mods should only set guidelines . 
   what 's one weakness you have ? 
  i am sometimes warm-hearted , but can be very strict when necessary . 
   would you rather fight one horse sized duck or one hundred duck sized horses ? 
  i would fight one horse sized duck . 
  i would befriend the duck with bread in my backpack and then gloriously fly on it around the world . 
  like this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adbmlte4wwg  what single word connects all of these three of the following words : europe , pussy cat , teacher ? 
  explain why i honestly think this is a joke question just to see what people come up with . 
  i also can not think of anything that would accurately connect all of these three words . 
  if they 're declared fit for work and they die 6 weeks later of natural causes you should really questions the assessment done . 
  `` processing centre '', 
  the last time i witnessed an outage was maybe 10 years ago . 
  place 28th . 
  if you talk about refugees you also talk about syrians . 
  because it 's ( if not state owned ) private property ? 
  you would n't expect to have 2 armed police officers in your house at all time to fend of burglars , do you ? 
  if you have a legitimate asylum claim i will gladly welcome you in germany . 
  france, 
  i think it 's anders breivik . 
  yeah , you 've seen them but did you live there and experience it yourself ? 
  a thousand refugees in a 50k population town or even a 200k town will not make a huge difference not to mention they wo n't have a devastating effect on local life ( what does that even mean to you ) . 
  how would you know ? 
  your country barely takes in any refugees compared to the rest of the eu . 
  this is 2014 : http://www.tagesschau.de/multimedia/bilder/asylbewerber-131~_v-videowebl.jpg this is 2015 ( january to april ) : http://www.tagesschau.de/multimedia/bilder/asylbewerber-143~_v-videowebl.jpg, 
  yeah and the report fails to mention when the people that got deported filed their asylum application . 
  asylum applications take months in germany , and the moment you 're actually deported could take another few months . 
  for all we know the people deported in 2014 could be asylum seekers from 2013 . 
  wrong , about 2/3 of asylum seekers are denied . 
  or here : http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/197867/umfrage/abgelehnte-asylantraege-in-deutschland/ for the year 2015 ( january to 30th of june ) 37,4 % are denied asylum , 26,5 % of the applications have not been accepted ( `` formelle entscheidungen '' ) meaning germany is not the country responsible for this application according to dublinii ( the vast majority ) or they have gotten german citizenship somehow ( e.g. 
  by marriage ) or have retracted their application . 
  that means ** 63,9 % ** of all applicants do not get asylum status in germany . 
   then he hit the gas pedal and began to run over the police , and two witnesses . 
  wrong , he did n't do that . 
  see : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3hfly1/german_diplomat_runs_over_a_policeman_in_ukraine/cu6ye6a, 
  / / edit of course these are no statistics which show how many are actually deported which is a whole different and mostly complicated process , and under circumstances can take years .
