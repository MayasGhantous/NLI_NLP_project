  well as a german , i really fancy a good czech black beer . 
  i meant the other dot , above vatican ( you know , where san marino is ) , that is san marino . 
  just guessing . 
  latin is the official language in the vatican , beside italien . 
  beer in latin is cervesia . 
  i heard the eurofighter typhoon is bad at dog fights because it can maneuver less good than other planes ( i forgot why ) . 
  then again you do n't really have dog fights anymore . 
   `` to base its claim , russia in this region used a broad range of scientific data collected over many years of arctic exploration , '' the russian foreign ministry said in a statement this week . 
  `` submitting the claim to the u.n. commission is an important step in formulating russia 's right to the arctic shelf in accordance with the united nations convention on the law of the sea . '', 
  if that is so it 's fine with me . 
  they only die when they have aids . 
  you can live just fine with just hiv . 
  http://www.aidsmap.com/how-long-will-i-live/page/2622625/  effective hiv treatment has brought about an incredible change . 
  many doctors now believe that , provided a person with hiv receives effective hiv treatment before their immune system has been severely damaged by the virus , and if they take their drugs as prescribed , they can live a normal life span . 
   that 's not to deny that people with hiv still become ill . 
  indeed , a few hundred people with hiv die each year in the uk , many as a direct consequence of their hiv infection . 
  but these deaths often involve people who are diagnosed with hiv late in the disease process , when their immune system is already severely damaged . 
  going back medieval style and using animal stomachs . 
  did anyone mention that the flag of montenegro looks kind of like the flag of nazi germany ( only in that small format ) ? 
  i had to do a double take to be sure . 
  he is mocking the glorification of `` war heroes '' . 
  that the holocaust ( and death camps ) was done by nazi germany should really be common sense . 
  he is not polish , he is franconian . 
  see https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/franken_ ( region ) also polands flag is upside down from the franconian one . 
  she ca n't legalize weed , the parliament does . 
  frankfurt is the gotham city of germany . 
  if the russian army is as good as their military parades the german army wo n't even have to replace their broomsticks with real weapons . 
  these guys look russian to me , the guy in the hat also spoke english to these guys . 
  i 'd rather have someone competent i do n't like then someone incompetent i do n't like . 
   but many companies , economists and even germany 's neighbors worry that the enormous cost to replace a currently working system will undermine the country 's industrial base and weigh on the entire european economy . 
  germany 's second-quarter gdp decline of 0.6 % , reported earlier this month , put a damper on overall euro-zone growth , leaving it flat for the quarter . 
  the cost is carried by the state , not by companies . 
  the article is from 2014 respectively so the second-quarter gdp decline of 0.6 % is from 2014 . 
  looking at this here : http://de.tradingeconomics.com/germany/gdp-growth-annual the author of the article seems to have been cherry picking his facts . 
  the decline of 0.6 % was because the first quartal had seen an exceptionally high growth of 2.6 % . 
   average electricity prices for companies have jumped 60 % over the past five years because of costs passed along as part of government subsidies of renewable energy producers . 
  prices are now more than double those in the u.s. could n't find anything indicating a 60 % increase of the electricity costs . 
  found this statistic : http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/252029/umfrage/industriestrompreise-inkl-stromsteuer-in-deutschland/ it shows the electricity price for the industry ( incl . 
  electricity tax ) . 
  from 2009 to 2014 the electricity went up 34 % , not 60 % , all of that increase is made up of taxes if you compare it with this other graph which excludes taxes : http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/155964/umfrage/entwicklung-der-industriestrompreise-in-deutschland-seit-1995/  one government estimate projects the energiewende by 2040 to cost up to $ 1 trillion , or about $ 1.4 trillion , or almost half germany 's gdp and nearly as much as the country spent on the reunification of east and west germany . 
  if you wan na change something it costs money . 
  it 's also $ 1 trillion over the course of 25 years which is $ 40 billion per year , which is about 0.012 % of the gdp ( ppp ) of germany . 
   sgl carbon , a maker of carbon-based products , in may decided to invest an additional $ 200 million to its plant in washington state on top of $ 100 million previously invested instead of investing in its home base of germany . 
  the company , which makes carbon fibers used to lighten the body of bmw 's new electric car at the washington facility , said electricity at the site costs less than one-third german rates . 
  surprise , gas prices in the usa are also lower , they are more than half of what we have in germany . 
  sacrifices have to be made . 
  germany 's gamble on renewable energy is less expensive than they make it be and energy is n't getting more expensive because of renewable energies , it 's getting more expensive because the government charges more taxes on them . 
  the energy came from all the windfarms in germany , not from the sun . 
  if you 're currently in germany you might remember that on saturday , july 25 , the weather was really stormy , in parts of the country the wind reached 50km/h or faster . 
  but that certainly does n't contradict your argument . 
  it simply was one day in the year where there were extremely favourable weather conditions to produce renewable energy and that 's why it was a 78 % peak . 
  ca n't read the article . 
  so from the same paul homewood that is a climate change denier ? 
  not very credible . 
  http://www.factcheck.org/2015/02/nothing-false-about-temperature-data/  the `` report '' to which palmer referred was actually a series of blog posts , written by climate change denier paul homewood , which were then highly publicized in two stories by christopher booker in the daily telegraph in london . 
  both writers focused on the adjustments made to temperature readings at certain monitoring stations around the world , and claimed that those adjustments throw the entire science of global warming into question . 
  this is not at all the case , and those adjustments are a normal and important part of climate science . 
  they do n't ask for your id .

  they should send someone with a google street view backpack to chernobyl .

  the fall of the fourth reich endl\u00f6sung der eurofrage, 
  there is nothing traditional about killing animals . 
   tallinn-helsinki for some reason i thought estland and finland are connected by land huh , you never learn out . 
  it will also make it easier for immigrants to get to sweden and norway by hiding in lorry trucks . 
  it looks very cool indeed .

  mostly people that make less than 1 % of the share i guess . 
  i agree it looks weird in the cake that you would n't disclose where more then 20 % of the people are from . 
  about 36 % are granted asylum , 37,5 % are deported back to their country . 
  the other 26,5 % are where the application is not checked because for example another country is responsible according to dublin ii ( most of the cases ) , the asylum seeker married ( a german ) or withdrew his application .

  huh ? 
  there are n't more albanians . 
  source : [ federal office for migration and refugees ] ( http://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/anlagen/de/downloads/infothek/statistik/asyl/statistik-anlage-teil-4-aktuelle-zahlen-zu-asyl.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ), 
  to be honest it does n't look that dramatic . 
  looks like it 's part of the daily life up there already . 
  the tax has been there forever , so it 's not really correlative . 
  people suddenly realizing `` oh honey , i just saw we have been paying tax to the church for the last 10 years , time to leave the church . 
  '' , yeah , not really . 
  but that has nothing to do with germany profiting because the euro is cheap . 
  it has to do with them being in a currency union and germany being better at production . 
  germany would benefit more in regard to say italy no matter how cheap the euro is in the scenario you describe simply because the production is better . 
  what you just said makes no sense and is not what / u/i30t said . 
  the other eu countries do not benefit less because germany benefits more , this would only be the case if germanys trade-surplus in the eu would benefit from it , germany only benefits for the trade-surplus for countries outside the eurozone which is also the case for any other country in the euro . 
  by investigating . 
  i am wrong though . 
   but if they are not fit to travel , there is no pass for a return or the situation in the country of origin does not allow a return , you receive a toleration until the deportation is possible . 
  this often takes years .

  the thing though is if you do n't have papers etc. 
  proving you are asylum eligible you will get deported . 
  you 'd be surprised but that 's exactly what he is saying publicly . 
  putin said it 's a shame the ussr dissolved and it 's the biggest mistake that happened . 
  that bank is owned by the german government and the minister of finance is automatically chairman of said bank . 
  so sch\u00e4uble does not profit from it . 
  uhm , that bank is owned by the german government and the minister of finance is automatically chairman of said bank .
