  the last time i looked france is still in europe . 
  that 's a really nice map . 
  like skoda ? 
  so what you are saying is that hungarians took german words and translated them word for word into hungarian because they did n't haven them ? 
  interesting . 
  by the way alter trottel means old jackass . 
  its called realpolitik . 
  it 's just slang of high german where you shorten words . 
  dat = das son = ( grammatically correct would be `` so ` n '' whereas the `` n '' stands for `` ein '' ) `` so ein '' nen = shortened form of `` einen '' ( grammatically incorrect in his sentence ) ne = shortened form of `` eine '', 
  you do in bulgaria .

   can you point to anything that would have happened differently if the power balance in the european parliament was different ? 
  i ca n't , so what difference does voting make ? 
  is that really the point of the parliament ? 
  i vote for politicians because i think they will represent most strongly my own political views in the parliament . 
  the point is not diversity in the parliament . 
  the eu is not inherently undemocratic . 
  it only seems undemocratic by how abstract the indirect democratic process is , you are not really in touch with the politicians in brussels & strasbourg and you do n't hear about them that much . 
  then again there is n't a lot of controversial stuff on a political scale happening in the parliament . 
  one thing i have in mind right now though is ttip . 
  you 're wrong : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rluphl04sc sure chrome is nothing special anymore since the other browsers catched up but it 's not crappy . 
  * software product, 
  it 's a shame really , a grave of my ancestor is part of the reason why my father has a bad relationship with his aunt . 
  my fathers grandfather had a grave and it was rented for like 20 years or so . 
  he had a good relationship with him . 
  part of the reason why my father had a good relationship with his grandfather was that his father died when he was just 13 in a car crash . 
  so basically what she did was , somewhere around the 90s or the 00s she got a letter that the lease for the grave is running out . 
  she did n't tell anyone and let it just happen . 
  the lease ran out and the cemetery `` destroyed '' the grave . 
  she did n't have the decency of telling anyone about it , the least she could have done was to ask if someone still wants to pay for the grave which is like 200 $ a year or so ( idk ) , so not that much money . 
  they were finally settled in the `` 2 +4 vertr\u00e4ge '' which was `` just '' 35 years ago , when germany did get unified . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_parliamentary_committee_investigating_the_nsa_spying_scandal because of this committee , we actually know about the bnd/nsa spying . 
  also this : [ spiegel : attorney general checks possibility of a criminal offense ] ( https://translate.google.de/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.spiegel.de%2fpolitik%2fdeutschland%2fgeheimdienst-bnd-generalbundesanwalt-prueft-straftat-a-1031686.html&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) and airbus going to court over the nsa/bnd spying . 
  yeah right , nothing will happen . 
  more so we just did n't shut down all of our nuclear plants , that 's not even possible from one day to another . 
  in 2011 the parliament made a new law which made 8 nuclear reactors lose their operating license . 
  there are another 9 left which will loose their licences as well in the coming years , the last one in 2022 . 
  at least we do something about it instead of pretending everything is ok . 
  merkel is a disgrace to germany . 
  i hate her fucking reactionary and populist politics . 
  thanks partially to our low birth rate . 
  yes , there are penions for civil servants , usually better than normal . 
  for example they get 71.75 % of their last salary ( gross ) as a pension ( but only after 40 work years ) . 
  there are other benefits compared to a normal pension . 
  the point of the outrage was that the usa spied on the average german citizen . 
  i fully expect them to spy on the german government , but anything else just smells like big brother and reminds us of times where the german people did n't have as much freedom as today and makes us wary . 
  and whoever said the bnd is not spying is naive , of course they do that 's their job . 
  in germany you are not all allowed to strike when working in the public sector , or to be more specific when you have the status of a civil servant which is not always the case . 
  this diagram does n't show how hard-working the average citizen is . 
  you can do a job in 4 hours time , working slowly and inefficient . 
  you could also do it in 2 hours working hard and efficient . 
  also , working hours correlate with social security , working rights , work culture etc. 
  in poorer countries you 'll find people working more than 1 job , working fulltime from 8am to 8pm because they are getting paid less for 1 job . 
  in asian countries you 'll find people completely devoted to their job , working all week . 
  so all in all this only shows which people work more , not harder . 
  also , arguing about which country is more lazy is just bullshit . 
  stop that . 
  you would have to define the capital anew everytime the european union gets another member . 
  that 's why you create laws to limit the abilities of unions in critical sections to the economy of a country . 
  not by cutting the balls off of unions all over britain . 
  for example in germany there are several laws and rules in place which limit the ability of unions to strike or not . 
  the strike has to be lead by a union . 
  only strikes which aim for a labour agreement are allowed . 
  political strikes for example which aim to influence the government or politics are forbidden . 
  the labour agreement they aim for has to be lawful . 
  strikes have to be the last means necessary . 
  means first there are talks and if these are not successful they are allowed to strike . 
  they are not allowed to strike when their demands are unreasonable . 
  also , in germany unions follow a simple principle : `` do n't kill a cow you are trying to milk . '', 
  it 's crap yeah , you do n't need schengen for a financial capital . 
  what is your point ? 
  in the eu there is frankfurt am main and london and i would say london is the bigger financial capital although frankfurt has the ecb . 
  it 's the reason why you can be so easily replaced by immigrants that are paid less . 
  yeah sure , like how you sacked margaret thatcher which did more bad to your country than good . 
  your country was fucked up way before the eu became a big thing . 
   it serves big business , as can be seen by the use of mass immigration to drive down wages and undermine the british working classes . 
  you must be fuckin kidding me . 
   the majority of our politicians do n't even want to give us a say on our membership now , totally bypassing any resemblance of democracy . 
  surely it 's the eus fault that your politicians are spineless kiddy fiddlers . 
  most notably hans and sophie scholl . 
  the whole internet and data is moving to a cloud based system . 
  speed is important . 
  as a german , words written out in dutch partially look similar to germans , i would n't understand spoken dutch though at all . 
  then there are words like `` maatschappij '' that just dont look like anything i know in german . 
  and '' ` luchtmacht ' is \u00e9\u00e9n woord , de afkorting is dan ook klu . '', 
  to a german dutch sounds and is written like a lovechild between english and german while being spoken by a drunken sailor . 
  they are n't and nobody is claiming that . 
  the turkish state is guilty of the armenian genocide , because it 's the successor of the ottoman empire . 
  the armenian genocide is largely accepted even by turks that it actually happened . 
  the point is that turks do n't call it a genocide , they basically call it a population transfer gone horribly wrong . 
  see this eli5 post : http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/33fkrr/eli5_the_armenian_genocide/cqkjsa0?context=4, 
  i was one my phone and did n't notice . 
  i do n't get it . 
  we have to be careful in that regard . 
  the economic crisis in the weimar republic is what partially laid the seeds for fascism too rise in germany . 
  without a doubt we have to hurt them but do n't bring them to the point of no return . 
  plus it 's pretty old . 
  greece wo n't do this because they do n't want to sour the german-greek relations . 
  right now the reparations are only functioning as a political leverage against germany , i do n't really expect anyone in greece thinks germany just gon na admit its guilt and pay the sum . 
  greece was excluded from being a signatory party in the `` 2 +4 vertr\u00e4ge '' to prevent war reparations , that 's the problem .
