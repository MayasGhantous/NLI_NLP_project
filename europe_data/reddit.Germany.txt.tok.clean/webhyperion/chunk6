  genscher , the foreign minister during these times was a genius man . 
  so germany indeed weaseled out but it already happened in 1990 . 
  so the thing now is since greece was `` excluded '' one could argue they still have legal grounds for reparations , because they did n't have the possibility to bring them forward then . 
  that 's juristically not possible without the agreement of germany . 
  the german government has given a declaration of submission to the international court of justice but that only counts for cases subject to things that happened after 2008 . 
  that 's not because they said so but because it only happened in 2008 . 
  that seems to be a common stance in russian foreign policies . 
  everyone get their tin foil hats out !, 
   because they do n't know anything about the eu . 
  italy, 
  is that an atomic bomb in the first picture ? 
  it 's from 2007 ... http://www.pewglobal.org/2007/06/27/chapter-6-views-of-world-leaders-and-institutions/, 
  because they do n't know anything about the eu . 
  might have to go to / r/longtail to see / r/europe posts . 
  with all the broomstick jokes , i did n't see any germans getting irrationally angry about it . 
  sentimental value is priceless . 
  you have to be fucking retarded if you think a comic about flag bearing balls that represent countries actually shows how real germans are . 
  beside most of the comics are not even made by germans . 
  k\u00f6nigsberg is n't even polish today , neither is fischhausen . 
  k\u00f6nigsberg was founded by the teutonic order in 1255 and has been under `` prussian '' rule since the 16th century until 1945 , when it was annexed by the udssr . 
  danzig is the only true polish city mentioned by the user above . 
  one thing i learned from poles is that they have a lot of pride in them , especially national pride and they are really unforgiving . 
  talk shit about poland or poles ? 
  you 'll have a flock of poles in minutes talking to you about how it is not true or they simply downvote you . 
  but i am generalizing here , a lot of poles though seem to be true to that stereotype . 
  there also is putty a ssh & telnet client , counter-strike source , dropbox and google drive . 
  that 's what you get when having 40 years of communism & planned economy . 
  of course , if you do n't publicly oppose the russian `` elite '' , like gathering people to protest etc or building an opposition you have nothing to fear . 
  russia might have a regime but the public is not as opressed as you think it is , it 's not north korea . 
  germans do . 
  i was grinning throughout the whole video , just perfect . 
  no it is n't if you watch the video . 
  nooo , they took our jerbs ! '', 
  your post made me really laugh and i am sorry that it is happening to your country . 
  exactly , the a2 is directly towards the `` truppen\u00fcbungsplatz altmark '' , a 230 km \u00b2 large training ground among other things for tanks . 
  it 's also called `` hillersleben '' , it was made by the nazis , then used by the soviets and then given to the bundeswehr . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncaorozdnxg the thick line is the a2 , the star indicates the location of the `` truppen\u00fcbungsplatz altmark '' . 
  yeah of course , let a greek court decide about the payment of 230 billion euro to the greeks . 
  not only would i argue is the verdict biased but it does n't hold any validation in germany . 
  let the international court of justice in den haag decide . 
  of course they wo n't do that because they know they ca n't win . 
  they are only having soldiers there now because in an event of an attack hundreds if not thousands of us soldiers would be killed and that would give them publicly enough reason to intervene without having the need for a nato or uno thing there . 
  it 's also a diplomatic nod to the baltic states and russia , that the usa is actively supporting them . 
  i think it 's good that the usa is doing that , but then i think it 's way too much back into cold-war thinking . 
  on the other hand , this was to be expected the way russia waves it dick around to it 's neighbors . 
  sa had 1.4 % population lose from 2000 to 2013 so i do n't know what the chart actually shows , the circle does n't seem to represent the whole sa but only a part of the region there . 
  no , the red circles are probably sachsen-anhalt and sachsen . 
  no italy , i repeat , no italy !, 
  i am pretty sure you 're confusing semesters with years , or either you 're talking about doing a bachelor + master which is not really necessary if you 're just looking for a moderately paying job . 
  ( note i am talking about germany here , so it might be different elsewhere ) . 
  a computer science bachelor is usually 6-8 semesters , even if you do it remotely . 
  there 's no reason that it would take double the time doing it remotely , especially in computer science . 
  the czech republic , slovenia and slovakia are probably your best bet while still feeling somewhat at home and not misplaced because of culture shock . 
  probably also easier for you to learn the language because of some similarities . 
  reminds me of this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njkpxb--vgm, 
  i can do that by offering gyros and kebab . 
  supposedly her uncle . 
  * lied, 
  when germans talk of `` s\u00fcdl\u00e4ndisch '' i.e. 
  mediterranean they mean more like looking like a stereotypical turk . 
  police handling is a matter of the federal state government . 
  looks amazing , almost as if it 's photoshopped . 
  really ? 
  i have this book with 80 of the brothers grimm fairy tales . 
  i took the liberty and photographed the colored illustrations of some fairy tales . 
  http://imgur.com/a/vaqa4 its originally from 1963 , i have the edition from 1996 . http://www.zvab.com/servlet/bookdetailspl?bi=16749655999&amp;searchurl=hl%3don%26isbn%3d3358000176 illustrated by https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/werner_klemke beside that , the czech fairy tale films have been pretty popular , especially the one about cinderella . 
  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070832/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drzcydb7aaq at least when i think about cinderella that 's what easily comes to my mind first . 
  when i think about snow white i have the rammstein music video in my head . 
  x ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stzcuaprrac, 
  this just shows that nothing has changed . 
  children playing ? 
  so dangerous !, 
  then make one . 
  even with machu picchu in the background . 
  that 's because they are using glonass . 
  supporting a kurdish state and reclaiming syria with assad are contradicting kind of . 
  you think other news agencies are gon na get a different answer from the russian government ? 
  turkmen rebels , not turk , there is a difference . 
  you can change the constitution . 
  you 'd just need 2/3 of the bundestag and the bundesrat . 
  there are also some parts that are barred from changing . 
  google translate because i am lazy :  any changes that you want to change the federal structure nationals or the fundamental participation of the l\u00e4nder in the legislative process , are prohibited . 
  prohibited are also changes in the principles of article 1 ( human dignity ) and article 20 ( state building ) . . ( article 79 paragraph 3 gg - . . 
  so-called eternity guarantee . ) . 
  if there is yet to such unauthorized modification , created unconstitutional constitutional law . 
  in german law treason is defined as basically `` espionage '' of state secrets of the german state . 
  https://dejure.org/gesetze/stgb/94.html it is however forbidden to fight in the armed forces of another country , in doing so you can lose your citizenship . 
  that law does n't apply for the french foreign legion , because of a treaty made in 2011 . 
  in the meantime we build this . 
  kafka is a famous author in german literature who is czech . 
  he went to a german gymnasium in czechia . 
  and coca cola made him dress in red . 
  you might be mistaken . 
  what we get credited for is popularizing it . 
  the german part of the british royal family apparently made it popular in britain . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albert,_prince_consort  popular myths about prince albert -- such as the claim that he introduced christmas trees to britain -- are dismissed by scholars . 
  in german ` curry ' just refers to the spice . 
  the map is not updated . 
  as of 2015 germans have visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 173 countries and territories . 
  i am infuriated , you tell me he found a sword but you do n't show a picture of it .
