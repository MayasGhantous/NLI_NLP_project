i 'd say it 's spoken in the middle . 
  3.10 $ would be spoken as * drei euro zehn * . 
  it really makes sense if you do n't think about it . 
  why would we want a greater bavaria anyway ? 
  i thought even serbia is slowly shifting towards the latin alphabeth . 
  am i mistaken here ? 
  the implications of the new coalition agreement between merkel 's christian union and the social-democratic party . 
  they 've been negotiating for nine weeks since the general elections . 
  well , i guess it 's still better than in belgium ... 
  ` who is this `` cour p\u00e9nal '' ? 
  i 've never heard of him . ', 
  the author also chose to ignore that to remain in the european economic area , norway has to enact eu laws in the areas of social policy , consumer protection , environment and company law . 
  all that without any democratic representation in the institutions of the european union !, 
  ( 1 ) din norms are not laws , they 're industry standards . 
  all national laws are available for free online . 
  ( 2 ) din is not a government 's body . 
  it 's a registered association ( e.v. ), 
  by the german industry . 
  ( 3 ) carl malamoud is threatened with a fine of $ 250,000 , not with jail . 
  ( 4 ) he would not go to jail if he ca n't pay , but if he is in non-compliance with a court ruling . 
  so , yeah , great article , boingboing . 
  as it happens so often in berlin , the riots did * not * originate from within the refugees , but from a group of extreme-left ` supporters ' . 
  only one person was arrested for breach of the peace and resistance ... a 22-year-old german . 
  oh , and also : fuck russia today . 
  do n't believe a word they write , they always hide pretty little lies in their articles . 
  [ das ist berlin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_a669rdv2c&amp;list=pl70a0136c9b790ba0&amp;index=7 ) . 
  actually a newspaper ad . 
  ` freedom ' is obviously the subject here . 
  i also particularly like [ this video ] ( https://vimeo.com/110554287 ) about the ` fall of the wall ' anniversary last year . 
  the [ saar offensive ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saar_offensive ) advanced a total of 8 kilometres - into villages that the wehrmacht had strategically abandonded . 
  it 's main objective was to strengthen france 's defence position in the border region , not to weaken or even defeat the german armed forces . 
  no , it comes down to moderators deciding what 's ` white supremacy ' and what 's just an arguably shitty opinion . 
  just now , someone in the megathread got called a ` nazi ' for posting a decidedly conservative comment . 
  saying this is a black-and-white issue is simply a fallacy . 
  comment history : european , coontown , coontown , coontown , european , european , coontown , coontown . 
  welcome to / r/europe , good-natured and well-behaving friend !, 
  edit : to be more on topic . 
  people * love * giving old clothes to those ` poor , poor africans ' . 
  well , maybe they do n't * need * all your old t-shirts and twenty odd socks . 
  in germany , aid groups that collect clothes mainly do so to sell them . 
  so they have enough money to spend on things that migrants actually need . 
  you know , like food and shelter . 
  you 've basically just outlawed the d\u00f6ner . 
   in an attempt to prevent invasion of poland by russian czar alexander i , napoleon decided to invade russia first . 
  that 's ... quite an over-simplification of the 1812 situation . 
  if they were allowed to , the same people who are shouting ` they do n't even work ! ', 
  right now would change their slogan to ` they take all our jobs ! ', 
  did n't say that . 
  i stand by what i said , though . 
  the iranians would n't have signed the deal if they did n't have something to gain from it . 
  and that ` gain ' , i suspect , is big-budget economic deals . 
  hello , little bot . 
  where did you come from ? 
  well , if social market economy does n't allow you to reward cooperative behaviour from otherwise ostrasized countries , then what 's the use ? 
  do you think the iranian government would have signed the nuclear deal purely out of love and friendship for the west ? 
   it  -- susanna turunen ( @turunensusanna ) july 20 , 2015 harsh words . 
   the question was about wolfgang sch\u00e4uble , her finance minister and fellow christian democratic party ( cdu ) member , who in an interview with germany 's der spiegel magazine on sunday said he was prepared to resign if ever forced to take a position on greece that he did n't agree with . 
  for . 
  the idea that sch\u00e4uble is playing with the thought of resigning has been rehashed by every single major publication , and it just does n't become any more truthful . 
  check the [ bildblog ] ( http://www.bildblog.de/67656/medien-spielen-mit-schaeubles-ruecktritt/ ) article if you can read german , or let me just quote from the [ spiegel interview ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/interview-with-german-finance-minister-wolfgang-schaeuble-a-1044233.html ) :  sch\u00e4uble : divergent opinions are a part of democracy . 
  in such a case , you jointly hash out a solution . 
  in that process , everyone has a role to play . 
  angela merkel is chancellor and i am the finance minister . 
  politicians ' responsibilities come from the offices they hold . 
  nobody can coerce them . 
  if anyone were to try , i could go to the president and ask to be relieved of my duties . 
   spiegel : are you thinking of doing so ? 
   sch\u00e4uble : no . 
  where did you get that idea ? 
  yeah , clearly this is a man who already has one wheel out the door ... 
  interesting . 
  can you cite a source for that ruling ? 
  do you think it is possible to change the constitution in a way to make this work ? 
   both germany 's elites and its citizens were almost willing to walk away from the entire euro project just on the mere suggestion yes , i remember how afd , the only serious anti-euro party , received a whopping 7 % of the votes in the european elections . 
  clearly , we * all * want to abandon the euro project ... 
  italy wants to sell its ... tubes ? 
  is that a weird way of saying ` macaroni ' or what ? 
  as far as i know , italy is mainly trying to get its business deals in oil , gas , and machine tools back on track . 
  should have used the time until security arrived to quitly put the money on the table and then leave . 
  there 's no need to * explain * your action to the journalists - as if anyone did n't understand what 's your message . 
  claiming lothar de maizi\u00e8re served the gdr ( east germany ) is rather misleading . 
  he was the first ( and last ) prime-minister voted into office in a free election . 
  and he specifically ran on a platform to bring the gdr to an end and seek reunification with the federal republic as fast as possible . 
  i never knew it 's a thing , either . 
  except ... 
  i have a photo of my father posing with a fake polar bear , too . 
  it 's ` sintflut ' , not ` sinnflut ' . 
  there is * no * way i do n't like the people in greece . 
  i 've grown up in a dysfunctional country , so i can quite emphasize with you . 
  my information comes from [ this article ] ( http://www.tagesspiegel.de/wirtschaft/ueberall-ist-niemandsland/8891202.html ) from * tagesspiegel * from 2013 , that said the land registraton project has completed about 35 % . 
  if that numbre has grown , then all the better !, 
  edit : maybe i should change my flare to ` gdr ' to make myself clear . 
  it 's an airport that nobody needed even when it was open . 
  now , it 's been closed for five years , so it 's probably not in best shape . 
  they 've tried for two years to find a buyer , without any success . 
  how much money would * you * be willing to spend on a completely useless airport ? 
  at least the chinese are planning to spend an additional $ 60 to 100 million on the place , which could lead to more contracts for spanish companies . 
   he even has the chutzpah to threaten merkel with his resignation should she force him to act against his convictions . 
  `` if anyone were to try , i could go to the president and ask to be relieved of my duties , '' he told spiegel in an interview . 
  from said interview :  spiegel : are you thinking of doing so ?
