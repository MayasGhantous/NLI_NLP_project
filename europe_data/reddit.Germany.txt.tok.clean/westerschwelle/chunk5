  they are not though . 
  let 's hope it does n't lead to new wars of the roses though , 
  i think both of you meant to say london , not the city of london . 
  he said islamic terrorists , not the kurds . 
  if he was unidentified , how did they know he was a 22 year old german citizen ? 
  also , who stabs someone ( to get away i presume ) only to then go on and stab themselves ? 
  i guarantee you everything will happen by the book . 
  no one wants to ruin the uk but they surely will not cut any corners for it either , if only to disparage others . 
  german government already said this . 
  what will happen to europeans currently living and working in the uk though ? 
  yeah . 
  i 'm really interested in how all of this turns out . 
  i do n't believe anyone is happy with how the eu is run . 
  i think some major changes are necessary and i hope this gets the ball rolling . 
  that does n't mean it does n't exist though . 
  edit : i do n't particularly care either way in regards to brexit , but i personally do think staying would be the smarter option . 
  i 'm really surprised wales is so much in favour of leaving . 
  ok , that 's what you `` feel '' is a lie versus the actual lies ( aka decidedly wrong statements sold to the public as facts ), 
  are you seriously so indoctrinated or disingenuous that you claim leave did n't lie to the people ? 
   england is a collection of city states with armed ** chavs ** roaming the wilderness that lies between them . 
  here you go . 
  no more free trade between the eu member states and the uk for now . 
  oh no she di'int !, 
  i do n't see the problem with sinn f\u00e9in . 
  you ca n't be both liberal and socialist at the same time , those are at opposite ends of the spectrum . 
  tell your father to cut off his nose then because mucus accumulates in it . 
  if you want to talk geographically that 's fine , but you should then know , that geographically speaking there is no `` europe '' . 
  it 'd have be be eurasia then . 
   and french guiana is a colony not part of europe . 
  it is a part of the eu . 
  because royalty and because geographically there is no european continent . 
  reporting in , 
  if only that were true :(, 
  parroting stupid stereotype ... much fun ... very humour, 
  [ yeah ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/738/025/db0.jpg ), 
  well apparently i had to tell you this . 
  fuck off tommy . 
  do n't you have a brexit to plan and a country to ruin ? 
  this is n't about postillon . 
  people who are happy do n't suffer from substance abuse . 
  exactly !, 
  yeah ok , but suicide is not homicide . 
   poor black males are four times more likely to commit crimes than poor white males . 
  i think what you mean is `` getting arrested for crimes '' . 
  basically , the problem is poverty . 
   if new york city were all ** rich ** , the murder rate would drop by 91 percent , the robbery rate by 81 percent , and the shootings rate by 97 percent . 
  ftfy, 
  except this comes from the united nations . 
  but nice tinfoil hat you 've got there . 
  what about alaska then ? 
  i do n't know how this bill is gon na be handled in practice but i know that i like this bill in principle . 
  democracy only functions when people can make informed decisions . 
  when there is a media outlet that spreads false information it disrupts the democratic process . 
  whose side someone is on does n't really factor into this . 
   the government gets to choose what is or is n't a lie no , the courts will decide that . 
  also , you should n't have anything to worry about big bad government because very soon it 's gon na be trump in power . 
  why would you then be worried about democrats taking away your freedom ? 
  edit : last but not least , if you think i 'm on the democrats ' `` side '' you are gravely mistaken . 
  what i 'm getting at is that they do n't have free press if they need to watch out or get arrested . 
   pedesta fell for a fucking phishing scam . 
  which is in itself fucking retarded . 
  so you 're saying they literally have journalists who are not in jail right now and that makes the press free ? 
  that bill is against outlets that flat out lie to the public . 
  asking the real questions . 
  `` mountains '', 
  but then he could be dealt with . 
  i got that but i think they should be far more blunt . 
  did n't know that . 
  that 's obviously bad , but why the fuck does a 13 year old boy have a tattoo on his arm ? 
  you mean his old german ones ? 
  turkish authorities acting like spoiled children as usual . 
  honestly ? 
  because i was tired : o, 
  it 's rommel, 
  me too :d better hit the hay :p, 
  but we love digging holes at beaches , you ca n't take that away from us !, 
  we have them at dunkirk so to speak ,

  we just want to bring some bread over :(, 
  the right answer is [ baumkuchen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baumkuchen ) of course ,

  do n't you still have your guillotines parked somewhere ? 
  sometimes i wonder if these people are actually retarded or of they 're simply evil . 
   i did my best to help hillary . 
  hillary is as bad as many of our right wing politicians . 
  you 've had your chance with sanders . 
  choosing between trump and clinton is like choosing what colour turd you want to eat . 
   `` mountain slope '' that 's cute , a mole probably dug a hill :d, 
  kinda like how the brexit referendum was non binding ? 
  yeah britain is more like 1984 . 
  the nazis were n't quite as good at surveillance . 
  like literally the thing that is referenced in this post for example . 
  he is being compared with hitler because he does and says many comparable things . 
  cool , thanks for taking the time to explain this to me . 
  maybe it 's a kind of germanism but i did n't know how to say it otherwise . 
  [ consequent ] ( https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/consequent ), 
  i think it 's only consequent .
