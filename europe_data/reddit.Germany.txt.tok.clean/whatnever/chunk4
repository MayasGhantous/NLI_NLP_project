  is that a bad thing ? 
  i think we need more spies like snowden . 
  how do you explain supplying the nsu with fake ids by pure incompetence ? 
  merkel expreses anger differently than normal people . 
  if she gets really , really angry with you , for example , she has breakfast with you . 
  after that , your career is over . 
  another way of hers to express anger is to express fullest trust in you . 
  a few weeks later , again , your career is over . 
  i think she meant full explanation more in the sense of an instructional explanation on how to play us again . 
  i think there are some `` i 'll show you mine if you show me yours '' agreements . 
  [ / r/conspiracy ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/interview-with-whistleblower-edward-snowden-on-global-spying-a-910006.html ) you say ? 
  i 'm still zooming ... 
  he 's a senile guy in his 70s , and a german politician . 
  what did you expect ? 
  see the positive side of it . 
  no matter how delusional and senile you once might become , you can always get a job as president of germany ... 
  how could they possibly get all that culture if they access the internet only by having their secretaries print them out emails and websites ? 
  the little thing that makes a difference might be the ease of access for one 's own government . 
  some governments are more willing to share information than others . 
  are you familiar with german internet legislation ? 
  if yes , you know why the typical german internet services suck ass . 
  ... use german web services instead to get some good old german spying . 
  overtime ? 
  german officials ? 
  you 're joking , right ? 
  if they should actually work overtime anyway , then most likely to destroy evidence on how much data on their own citizens the nsa handed over to them on their request . 
  true , but that does n't mean the spying infrastructure was dismantled afterwards . 
  it can serve so many other purposes than spying on [ insert current enemy ^ 1 here ] . 
  like for example industrial espionage ( i recall a scandal around the echelon network being used for that some years ago ) ^ 1 the definition of `` the enemy '' has gotten rather fuzzy lately , and can be interpreted to mean almost everyone anyway . 
  publicity . 
  people do n't like being spied on , so staging a huge outcry might increase the chances to get elected . 
   where does this come from ? 
  my best guess is european media copying american media who go apeshit after finally realizing that they have been spied on . 
  exactly . 
  fake and [ late ] ( http://www.reactionimage.org/1681843448.html ) . 
  echelon has n't been around since yesterday either . 
  unfortunately , the bnd is more on the nsa 's side here . 
  somewhere , some politician 's secretary is printing out this comment right now . 
  because that 's how politicians access the internet . 
  it goes back way more than only 15 years . 
  the echelon communications surveillance network for instance has been around for the most part of the cold war . 
  i find the sudden global outrage sparked by americans finally realizing that their government 's spy agencies do what ? 
  spy on people ? 
  really ? 
  both frustrating and amusing . 
  [ also way too late . 
  ] ( http://www.reactionimage.org/img/gallery/1681843448.jpg ), 
  he also says that it 's old news he has been speaking about for years . 
  why the sudden media attention ? 
  not really , especially in a situation where some voices are louder and more likely to be heard ( and listened to ) if unreasonable bullshit is repeated often enough , even the more reasonable people in a crowd will start to buy it . 
  good point , about the media . 
  at the current state of affairs , we 'd risk to be ruled by the tabloids and their mindless mob of `` readers '' , certainly not very pleasant . 
  but they usually did n't abolish themselves . 
  as our current political caste wo n't do anything that could reduce their influence . 
   why not take the leap and expand upon the democratic model ? 
  because politicians ... 
  do they also weld sewer manholes shut over there ? 
  they started this ridiculous bullshit with g. w. bush afaik ... 
  i wonder how excessive the safety precautions will be this time . 
  my best guess is anything short of rebuilding the berlin wall ... 
  the problem is that european states are n't exactly innocent when it comes to large scale spying on their own citizens . 
  the eu itself is responsible for fun things like an eu directive on data retention , for example . 
  i think it will be hard to find a service that 's not subjected to spying by one or another government . 
  it might make sense to choose a service in a country which is the most unlikely to cooperate with one 's own spy agencies . 
  bigots apparently think alike all over the world ... 
  it 's more like all dystopian novels had a huge orgy and we 're living in their inbred bastard child of a world . 
  i hate being spied on by anyone . 
  but unfortunately government backdoors in all sorts of communication services are a fact . 
  european governments do it , too . 
  no wonder the eu commission is keeping their mouths shut about this issue . 
  its hard to escape the spying , so i prefer using services where likely only foreign governments have backdoors into , because the last government i want to spy on me is my own so for me , as a german , i still prefer us based services over german services . 
  misleading title . 
  there has nothing been granted yet . 
  what happened is just that the constitutional court made a ruling . 
  it can ( and will ) take years until politicians make it into a law . 
   i 'm a fair bit higher than the river so would be well out of it but there would be plenty who are n't . 
  same here , but had to help out those plenty a bit last weekend . 
  i hope they 'll be able to keep their dry feet . 
  the rhine fortunately did n't get as much of the rain as the southern and eastern rivers . 
  the floods going on at elbe , danube and oder make [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1fij1l/central_europe_hit_by_floods_after_days_of_rain/caatyke ) look tiny in comparison . 
  lol . 
  just lol . 
  update : [ the dike has a leak ] ( http://www.morgenweb.de/newsticker/suedhessen-ticker/biblis-leck-im-weschnitz-damm-1.1059759 ) , but on a different location than the one that has been reinforced with sandbags . 
  rumor has it that making the infamous grey leberwurst is somehow connected to sweeping the floor of the butcher 's shop . 
  nonetheless it 's delicious . 
  it 's surprisingly delicious , especially if you add a pinch of salt . 
  i 'm a volunteer firefighter in the south of hesse , germany . 
  although i do n't live directly at a place affected by the floods , i 've been filling sand bags from friday night to saturday morning as a part of a county wide effort to secure and reinforce a flood dike that was under construction when the flooding started . 
  tomorrow at this time i 'll know if the measures taken were successful .

  to everyone living at a place affected by the floods : stay dry . 
  also ** a big thank you ** to all the kind people who are supplying the emergency workers with food , drinks , coffee and so on , it is much appreciated . 
  we could n't do what we do without you . 
  wherever they have been part of a government , they have been supporting the same social cutbacks as all the other parties . 
  the urge to stay in power appears to be stronger than principles . 
   mainly , cost for private sector goods - especially unforgoable regular cost like rent , water , electricity - will rise to largely capture surplus , not reducing the working week . 
  that 's why goods of basic necessity must be regulated . 
  without regulation , the prices will go up as high as people can afford to pay . 
  basic infrastructure like electricity and water should n't even be privately owned , because that comes with all sorts of shenanigans for profit 's sake . 
   even if you vote/protest a party out of office , there 's no guarantee that the new public 's sweetheart wo n't be lobbied into corruption all over again .
