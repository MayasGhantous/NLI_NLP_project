  where i live leaving islam is not punishable by death . 
  period . 
  when / u/obliviuns simply states it is without context , i 'd like to contradict . 
  i was distinguishing between `` many muslims say it is punishable '' and `` it really is punishable '' . 
  i never read any religious book and probably never will and in my opinion the statement  leaving islam is punishable by death . 
  is simply wrong . 
  it 's not punishable by death , because we have no law that makes it so . 
  yes , but these people have nothing to say in any european parliament . 
  i 'll stick to my local law books . 
  leaving islam is not punishable by death . 
  some people , who do n't represent the majority in swedish legislative , may think it should be , but it ai n't . 
  nowhere in europe and people living and who are welcome in europe are free to choose their religion and grant that right to every other european . 
   mock it [ ... ] pass laws demanding mandatory prison time for mocking jews that does n't sound very wise to me . 
  front row sign : `` deutschland halt 's maul '' ( `` shut up , germany '' ) . 
  that 'll further my cause !, 
  it is , i agree , but first you have to determine who is an economic migrant . 
  ca n't do that with tens of thousands of people at a border crossing . 
  what do you expect them to do ? 
  attack the asylum-seekers , as they do in heidenau in germany ? 
  sometimes you do that , if a certain fee 's use is determined and you want to shuffle money into that . 
  in this case , after / u/helm asked about rent , i wanted to emphasize that it 's net money and that i and many others i know lived on a lot less than 500 $ after paying for rent and everything . 
  i usually call that lagging behind after the first half . 
  we did n't . 
  the how do you pay taxes with that ? 
  and your water and electricity bill ? 
  if you know this , then this would be a nice comment on the post . 
   european based cloud storage providers ? 
  [ 3 tiny reviews inside ] people in / r/europe wo n't like it , because they read the title of the post . 
  last time it was posted it was criticized , that the video says at the end `` clips for the counter jihad '' . 
  is there something to show , that these are not some french nazi collaborator people ? 
  also , `` counter jihad '' !, 
  why would you use your opponents marketing slogans you wimps , man up !, 
  how do you handle illegal immigration right ? 
  when the people arrive at the beach , they are here . 
  their right for asylum is checked and if it 's denied , they are sent back , if not they get asylum , as long as there is a reason for it . 
  at the moment there are coming more people than in the last years , that 's why we are overchallenged with our current resources . 
  what other way is there to do this , what would the politically right parties do differently and what could they do differently ? 
  and supporting the guys who kill the shit out civilians , who in turn will become refugees . 
  and bombing people themselves who will contribute to the stream of refugees . 
  ok , but we need our broomsticks back on the next [ nato exercise ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/german-army-paints-broomsticks-black-to-resemble-machine-guns-in-nato-exercises-10054468.html ) . 
  do n't want to look unprepared . 
  i see , a beautifully fitting name , although lacking a monetary reference , as amber , or diamond , or aurel . 
  you do n't want her to appear as a broke communist . 
  as a matter of fact i know about the rigidity of german broomsticks and let me tell you , they can easily hold a machine gun . 
  a machine gun weighs about as much as a crate of beer , right ? 
  but what would the german do with the gun ? 
  we do n't need guns . 
  he would n't need a broom if he did n't leave his mk14s lying around everywhere . 
  typical ex-soviet lickspittle . 
  russia , canada and brazil are even bigger friends of europe . 
  we are friends with everyone !, 
  maybe soon ? 
  we could change you for the uk . 
  i do n't know , if a beggar spends 1 $ for breakfast while the richest man of europe spends 10000000 $ , i think you can safely say that one of them spends more for their breakfast , although the percentages of their income might be similar . 
  wow , i must agree , she * is * beautiful . 
  i assume her name is some city , or a season ? 
  80mio ger = 100 % 0,8 mio ger = 1 % 40 % - 2 % = 38 % =  38 \\* 0,8 mio = 30,4 mio that means the 42000 american soldiers must have 30,4 million guns to increase the numbers accordingly , on average 723,8 guns per soldier . 
  i know , that us soldiers are the best of the best of the best of the universe , but i do n't think that anyone of them could carry more than 10 weapons . 
  so this is still impossible . 
  we have schifffahrt only since the reform . 
  it used to , that the same three consonants were only written , if a fourth consonant follows ( sauerstoffflasche ) , otherwise you write only two ( schiffahrt ) . 
  [ now you write always all consonants . 
  [ found some !, 
  ] ( http://blogs.transparent.com/dutch/your-guide-to-dutch-abbreviations/ ) how do you teach that to foreigners ? 
  in my experience they get to know the good rules , the natives just learned them somehow . 
  examples , or you 're lying . 
  30-50 guns per 100 people in germany ? 
  [ never !, 
  ] ( http://www.zeit.de/2014/04/waffen-deutschland ) in some regions there are almost 2 % and not that we like peace or freedom , but [ we have oil ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mittelplate ) , too, 
  that 's what they told you . 
  i 'm sure they only expected the ugly ones to leave . 
  is sandy lane very expensive , or why do you have your whole address as your flare ? 
  you have those , too ? 
  i thought only we have the last pieces of shit politicians , acting for the acting not for the sense of it . 
  making it easier to write for out dumb pupils and doing a half assed job , by not getting rid of every \u00df , only of half of it , because it 's easier . 
  what a shit idea this shit . 
  and he could n't write properly . 
  he was frenchier than i 'd like to admit . 
  but his favourite city of all the cities in his frankenreich was ? 
  aix la chapelle , sukka , where the water smells like foul eggs . 
  he also got up from his grave to give his gingerbread recipe to a baker apprentice . 
  his ex ? 
  op , if you show people the naked underage pissing boy , make sure to pass by the town hall of bruges , then people are n't too disappointed . 
  two siamese twins, 
  do the planes `` belong '' to the carrier ? 
  i thought they just take the ones that come fully fueled out of the planewash . 
   short , blows load really quickly , less capable yep , that sounds british . 
  they also got two brand new helicopter carriers . 
  5 is good ? 
  margaret rutherford as miss marple and for the moment inspector barnaby . 
  one upvote for dinner for one , one downvote for mr bean . 
  i 'll never understand how the brits could turn facts and claim we are lacking humor . 
  savage ?!? 
  currywurst , pommes , mayo is the trinity of the food god . 
  i pitty the fool who 's mother country is not blessed . 
  yeah , but they always make it look like a bad thing . 
  are there more tent cities than the one in dresden ? 
  edit : yes , google knows . 
  i sure wo n't . 
  what they said was german muslim = best muslim .
