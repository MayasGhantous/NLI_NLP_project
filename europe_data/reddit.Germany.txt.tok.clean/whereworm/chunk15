  it 's called [ `` generic ? 
  masculinum '' ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/generisches_maskulinum ) . 
  there 's no english wikipedia page , sorry . 
  somebody argued convincingly that the fact that there are two genders and people would be brought up in one gender role , the person would change it 's behaviour accordingly . 
  that 's what education does , imo , but i can agree that something like gender studies could have it 's place in academia . 
  what i do n't agree with , is that some entitled pricks who , when getting the feeling that somebody listens to them , start talking louder , ca n't differ between their chosen field of research and the real world . 
  their shit would n't win them a nobel prize , but they act like it should . 
  if your sex is masculine and you like to play with dolls , fine do so . 
  no need to bother anybody about it . 
  if you are female and like to play football , feel free to do so , but do n't expect boys to lessen their fun by considering your weaker physique . 
  welcome to the world of not so strong boys . 
  and do n't get me started about making up new genders . 
  where does that shit come from ? 
  so , i do n't have a problem with effeminate men or masculine women . 
  i have a problem with people who act like it was n't there and like it was n't possible to be such in the last 100000 years . 
  i never disagreed with your opinion . 
  i even stated that there are only two genders imo . 
  i do n't know and i 'm fine with locking the gender to the sex , identified by the chromosomes . 
  there are exceptions to every rule . 
  just sayin . 
  there are abnormalities where you ca n't identify men and women , belonging to the only two sexes and genders there are , by their chromosomes . 
   my gender identity is non-binary , which in my case means that i neither identify myself as a man or a woman  i felt inadequate as a person , and as if i could n't fully exist , as if my full gender identity and identity were not acceptable you ca n't make that shit up . 
  would you say that they did do anything wrong ? 
  same in germany . 
  you do n't abort living humans . 
  embryos do n't live , so they ca n't die . 
  oi , the nazi argument . 
  1 point godwin to you !, 
  that 's no true slav squat . 
  they lift their heels off the ground . 
  blocked in capigalist germany . 
  toilett lenin , but works now . 
  they did n't qualify . 
  that 's a great idea , although i ca n't open toilenin . 
  ~ ~ so , kgb ruined europe ? ~ ~ nevermind . 
  erdogan will complain that it 's not about him . 
  did n't find much on the [ english wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nation_state#characteristics_of_the_nation_state )  they [ nation states ] have a different type of border , in principle defined only by the area of settlement of the national group the german one mentions that the ideal of a nation state would contain one complete nation . 
  i understand it in that way . 
  if parts of that nation lived among others , a nation state would thrive towards anschluss , because it would aspire to be a state for the complete nation , but maybe that is an additional step . 
   neither i nor my ancestors had part in that . 
  and if so , i would n't hold it against you . 
  yeah , no google translate and a free luxury apartment , a mercedes , nice clothes , various electronic gadgets and 2000 $ a month to spend . 
  [ wikipedia says ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/f%c3%bcnfter_sachstandsbericht_des_ipcc#beobachtete_ver.c3.a4nderungen_im_klimasystem ) that the heat is absorbed in the ocean and that the ice shields globally shrunk in the last two decades . 
  it also mentions that since the 50s mankind is responsible for most of the changes . 
  this is behind the first link in your ice article : `` nasa study shows global sea ice diminishing , despite antarctic gains '', 
  i agree that the negative connotation of the word `` nationalismus '' is due to an engraved , hereditary nazi conscience , but love does n't necessitate hate . 
  you can prefer something without a deviation from neutrality towards related things . 
  as , for example , i 'd prefer a * proper * currywurst-pommes-mayo over pea soup with mettwurst and a rubber role out of a goulash cannon , but i like the latter very much . 
  i would n't call waving your sports team 's flag patriotism . 
  especially when people would n't want to be seen with their country 's symbols after the media attention declined . 
  you mean , because the predominant people living in germany is of german ancestry ? 
  the german nation is not solely housed on german soil . 
  we need more lebensraum than that . 
  i could n't be patriotic and nationalphile at the same time , because some of us settled before you shrunk our precious motherland . 
  well i could , but i had to differ between `` ich liebe doch alle ... alle menschen ( deutscher nationen ) '' and `` hup hegemony hup '' . 
  if patriotism is the love for one 's country , then nationalism would be the love for one 's nation . 
  it does n't have to be negative towards other countries or nations . 
  germany is just no national state , so patriotism and nationalism does n't go together that well in our case . 
  i think it 's only natural that people are fond of the cultural habits , holidays , movies , or humor , since that is what makes up the `` good old memories '' or people behaving like oneself was brought up . 
  the disdain of others is not a feature of patriotism or nationalism , in my opinion . 
  for both it can be expressed inclusive/positive `` i like it here/i like these people '' and exclusive/negative `` we do this/are better than others '' . 
  mainland continentalism is what i am hoping for . 
  and i just read several posts how surprisingly civil this thread actually is . 
  hello ~ ~ darkness ~ ~ rawkz my old friend ... 
  when one opinion gets the upper hand , then commenters start to calm down , do n't they ? 
  [ rawkz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rybni0kb1bg ), 
  too much for germans . 
  just point on something that does n't affect the majority and say nazi , that 's how the public works . 
  few years ago some shops did n't accept debit cards for small fees , e.g. 
  below 10 $ , because the shop has to pay some cents either for the transfer or the identity check of the person ( checking the pin ) , maybe for both . 
  so , it 's cheaper for shops to identify you by your signature , but if you cancel the payment later , the shop has the problem . 
  i guess that 's why paying small amounts in cash is common . 
  have n't seen any bakery that accepted plastic . 
  did they get rid of your cancer ? 
  9,50 $ is too much . 
  they would waste their time by putting up content between the ads . 
  they know that if they do it on their own , nobody will visit their sites anymore , so they want to get a court to say no . 
  same is true with news snippets from their sites used in google search results . 
  they wanted a court to force google to pay for their snippets . 
  the court decided , that they could forbid google to display their news , but they refused to do that , because nobody would get to their site . 
  cool thanks , the spushi looks ok . 
  i think the `` pork with ham '' part is quite honest . 
  it 's an edible dish from a pig , with more from said pig . 
  yeah sure . 
  make up the most complicated word in the world , so that nobody can use it as an easy insult . 
  also , they should n't fall for the phobia idiocy . 
  you do n't have a somethingphobia just because you do n't like something . 
  spam the `` food '' ? 
  what has spam to do with hawaii . 
  i 'm offended by what you are implying . 
  there is only one korea . 
  if he were from alsace , it would come naturally . 
  `` has german under '' ? 
  you have a lot of tomatoes ? 
  thought the red water balloons came from the netherlands . 
  well , not * that * red ... 
  now that you mention it , i stand corrected . 
  how do you prevent a mormon to drink all your beer on your fishing trip ? 
  invite another mormon . 
  that 's it !,
