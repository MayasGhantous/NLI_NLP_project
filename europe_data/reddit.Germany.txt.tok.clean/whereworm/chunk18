  that also gave me the opportunity to learn several legal terms in english . 
   today , there are still some disparities in the protection of the presumption of innocence across the european union . 
  in what eu countries , except uk and denmark , do n't those points apply ? 
  i thought that were common rights , except in uk and denmark . 
  mission accomplished, 
  one or two weeks ago i wrote an e-mail to the federal agency for migration and refugees , if there is data to refute the concern , that refugees are lying to be underage , i.e. 
  by showing that there is no peak in 16-17 year old refugees . 
  i did n't receive an answer up to now . 
  not with adolf hitler . 
  herman g\u00f6ring is ok , too .

  typical italy !, 
  because he killed himself , otherwise he could 've lived 700 years . 
  [ i guess god told you so . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edcqf_ntpoq ), 
  bulgarians should flee the oppression of their country and apply for asylum in germany then . 
  ethnical cleansing . 
  i 'm glad that the paper is using the same vocabulary for right assholes as media uses for left assholes , but activists is clearly the wrong choice . 
  all are 1 . ? 
  germany could n't even force german radio stations to play * some * percentage of german music . 
  because nazis . 
  germany could n't even write in their constitution that people in germany speak , you know , german . 
  guess why !, 
  dutch is fine . 
  it 's cute when good looking women speak it . 
   however , due to the `` invisible '' effects of unwanted attention , crude comments and intimidating behaviour , women are less likely to report them as they would with physical attacks . 
  you have my full attention , if you want it or not . 
  i do n't care . 
  it might be the independent , but these examples kind of define school . 
  ok , i 'll have a look at the second google search results page , give me a sec . 
  edit : here they are trying to destroy [ mercedes benz ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/transport/eu-take-legal-action-germany-dai-news-532892 ) . 
  i had that already , but obviously harmful . 
  [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/scoreboard/_archives/2014/02/performance_by_governance_tool/infringements/index_en.htm ) the number of unjustified infringement cases against germany is in the red !, 
  the red !,

  there are literally dozens of cases against germany . 
  and maybe we just do n't as much wrong as one of those other countries . 
  booo !, 
  thank, 
  ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-12-530_de.htm ), 
  you are talking about our imports , right ? 
  erdogan , bringer of the good aspects of the flood ? 
  we should take iraq as an example . 
  they build a dam in the tigris to ease the floods and harness the flow , which is serviced and protected by italian soldiers . 
  does anybody who does n't like erdogan have an idea how it could be possible for greece to stop the crossing over of the refugees ? 
  give them the hose ? 
  beat them with jumper cables ? 
  yes , a joke . 
  i 'm a bit disappointed that they did n't have any eu flags in the background . 
  some days ago there was an article posted , which was about the big increase in real earnings in germany . 
   the only one horrified ought to be the insurance companies because that is how insurances work !? 
  they print money and do n't charge every person who buys an insurance policy ? 
  every person is paying for the actions of those fucking assholes . 
  not to mention the cost of the fire department and police . 
  and people living next to the torched cars . 
  but no , left violence is the good one , victimless crimes practically . 
  those people are the same shit as right extremist scum . 
  prag is great !, 
  if you turn right directly after crossing the charles bridge in direction of the castle , after 50m-100m there is a small backyard caf\u00e9 / pub on the right , really comfy there . 
  have n't been really far outside of the city center , except for my hotel . 
  next time i 'd like to visit chesky krumlov , because of the bird 's - eye perspective . 
  `` how was your vacation ? '', 
  `` great , best vacation eva ! '', 
  `` really ? 
  why ? 
  what was so great ? '', 
  `` the roads were empty ! '', 
  on my first day of work in spring i kicked around the leaves on the ground , which covered dog turd . 
  still nobody laughed . 
  that 's the point of this thread , cleandieselpowerbro . 
  welp , looks like we need a common border with you to sew on . 
  anybody oppose ? 
  if we repeat it enough it becomes true . 
  you should see the organizational comittees on carnival . 
  they march sturdier than the people they make fun of . 
  the proud people of [ kurdistan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurdistan#/media/file:kurdish-inhabited_area_by_cia_%281992%29.jpg ) live partly in turkey , syria , iraq and iran . 
  kurds are pissed at turkey , because turks forbade them to speak their language and tried to assimilate them by denying them their culture and calling them mountain turks ( bergt\u00fcrken ) . 
  turkey is also a bit nationalistic `` charged '' with their territory . 
  kurds on the other hand bomb and kill turkish soldiers/police men . 
  my eyes !, 
  call me hawk-eye !, 
  [ here ] ( http://www.sechel.it/erste-station-von-ns-stadtteilkonzept-leipzig-gruenau/ ) is one ( back to front ) . 
  the text says `` klagt nicht , k\u00e4mpft ! '', 
  ( do n't complain , fight ! ) . 
  i never heard it , or saw such a flag . 
  some sites say , that it was a slogan of the `` ns-fallschirmj\u00e4ger '' ( paratroopers of the wehrmacht ) , but i did n't find any neutral pages to confirm that . 
  the political party `` die linke '' ( the left ) asked the ministry of defense about an incident with said slogan . 
  the answer was , that no historical reference could be found between the slogan and paratroopers of the wehrmacht . 
  [ number 56 , page 47 ] ( http://dipbt.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/18/000/1800036.pdf ) written questions [ from members of parliament ] and answers from the federal government my opinion is , that from the looks of the flag the carrier wants to be identified with the far-right . 
  in proper german : i 'd say it 's a neo-nazi flag . 
  from [ their wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pegida#position_paper_.28positionspapier.29 ) * approves the right of asylum for war refugees and politically persecuted people . 
  * mentions zero tolerance towards criminal refugees and immigrants . 
  * indicates that pegida opposes any radicalism , whether religious or politically motivated . 
  so , you are pro pegida now ? 
  it is derived from [ this flag ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/wirmer-flagge ) , article is in german . 
  i never heard of that guy , but apparently it was suggested as a german national flag , which the german resistance should use after a successful assassination of hitler . 
  snobbish to me sounds more like [ them ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou0zzu7alui#t=3m54s ) to me , although they are not . 
  maybe i should have a look towards berlin , usually * capital * ists are snooty . 
   like , does religion/catholicism/any kind of broad christian sentiment actually get reasonably invoked by german politicians ?
