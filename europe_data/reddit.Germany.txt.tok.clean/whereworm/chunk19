  what did bachmann say afterwards about the incident ? 
  that 's embarrassingly true .

   mr osborne said : `` we have today secured a significant victory and strengthened the protections for the uk in the latest greek bailout and any future bailouts of eurozone countries . 
   `` i made clear to my european counterparts that this was an absolute red line for britain . '', 
   mr osborne added : `` these have been tough talks , but the agreement announced this evening means an impregnable ring fence around british taxpayers ' money , which will not be at risk in any way in this emergency financing for greece . '',

  you infiltrated the route long enough . 
  amsterdam a9 -  a12 claim to be asylum seekers at the border , then a3 -  a2 or you can take the detour over the a44 behind dortmund , then go towards the a38 , that 's always free , but top off the gas before . 
  a4 is also possible , but not before gie\u00dfen , otherwise you have to take the ordinary road for some time ( b429 , i suppose ? ) . 
  edit : but be especially careful on the a44 shortly before kassel . 
  there are some speed traps . 
  kankeranything !, 
  could you occupy neutral belgium as well ? 
  they stole our beck 's . 
  if you want , we have some nice , unoffensive and informatory leaflets .

  police and bnd/nsa have a hard time to undermine the left with mules ( v-leute ) . 
  if these informants are connected with a crime or are in the board of certain political parties , then it happens , that a crime is not persecuted , or a political party ca n't be forbidden , because it could have been the police who supported the radicalization of the party . 
  this is in the news now and then , but it is never about the left , since the mule tactic does n't work as well with them . 
  all in all it must appear as , there are many right-wing crimes , but police does n't do anything about it .
