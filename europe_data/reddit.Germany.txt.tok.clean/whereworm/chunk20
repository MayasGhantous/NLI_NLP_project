  f\u00f6rster also take care of recreational forests , do n't they ? 
  or what do you call that guys ? 
  at the moment those countries do n't take their citizens back . 
  things usually brighten up for me , once i get to the bottom of them . 
  who is we ? 
  i see them , when they walk from their camp to a supermarket , or downtown . 
  indeed . 
  this winter was very nice . 
  four days of snow and sub-zero temperatures , the rest of the time could have been some really nice spring days . 
  but brace yourself !, 
  refugees are coming !, 
  that 's a well integrated foreigner there . 
  the kind we like . 
  now you are * accusing * her of rape ? 
  they 're coming through germany . 
  wait till they are harvested and you can only mine amalgam fillings . 
  maybe people are well aware that `` ausweisung '' is not the same as `` abschiebung '' . 
  just like people from every other religion . 
   pepper spray and teasers that 's mean . 
  we protect our borders like we fight our wars . 
  we pay others to do it , because we do n't like to get our hands dirty . 
  we sure have no problem to close our border with you . 
  nope , just expensive . 
  samurai are japanese . 
  no human will ever walk on mars . 
  that was a pr trick of bush to distract from his fuck up with the war in iraq . 
  1 . dunno 2 . no 3 . yes united , especially uk, 
  the scenes from [ their parliament ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvjwnrqaeou ) are great . 
  [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0apzmzfj0a0] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0apzmzfj0a0 ), 
  who 's is that ? 
  the refugees know which country is better , a million times better . 
  you must be [ blind !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anarchist_pogo_party_of_germany ), 
  does n't make it better , if two countries have the problem . 
  private channels can do what they want . 
  they are not part of the billion dollar industry of the forced funding with illegal taxes . 
  the public broadcasters always argument with their duty to inform , educate and entertain , so that they ca n't broadcast only the good selling programs . 
  this is where they failed now . 
  onlya bittighter tosave space . 
  spd is a s left as the fdp . 
  disregard the last three weeks of comments from wagenknecht die linke in west germany is a fucking communist party . 
  what you are saying is , that every country that does n't guarantee a minimum wage is breaking the human rights ? 
  people in germany did n't suffer from a existence unworthy of human dignity two years ago , although we did n't have a minimum wage back then . 
  my  i do n't believe , that minimum wage is a human right . 
  meant that you either pay minimum wage to everybody , or no one . 
  but getting a minimum wage is not a human right . 
  a pittance is a pay , is n't it ? 
  and we germans , especially with our history , owe it to everyone forever to fuck ourselves over . 
  kypros has no houses . 
  what is the slur ? 
  so that i can avoid it . 
  do you have ovens in your huussis ? 
  do you fire up a oven for 2 minutes ? 
  i do n't believe , that minimum wage is a human right . 
  what i would like to read is :  so then you support the notion that these people should all be rejected and deported , since they failed to apply for asylum in the first safe country ? 
  because that 's also a rule , you know ? 
  no , it is not . 
  actually it works like [ this . 
  buuut the european country in which they arrived is responsible for reviewing their application of asylum , according to dublin 3 . 
  and if they apply elsewhere they are supposed to be transferred to said country . 
  your nay saying comment does n't really help anybody , not even your cause . 
  if you claim that an information is wrong , you could correct it . 
  i would n't say they can get out of it without losing face . 
  the only option they had was to invite everyone , without any biased preselection . 
  why `` inflated '' and not `` more precise '' ? 
   without losing face ?? 
  you may exchange him with kim jon un . 
  we need a chink in the list , because people might call us racist otherwise . 
  a few months ago our brand new navy helicopters could n't fly over water . 
  we , too . 
  what would parrot 's guts be ? 
  i first read that as papageiinnereien and not papageieier . 
  did you read the words ? 
  they are not intelligible at all . 
  `` sch\u00fctze '' sounds like an inaccurate pronunciation of `` sch\u00fcttest du '' . 
  the whole thing sounds like `` protect me !, 
  protect me !, 
  pour me another one , would you ? 
  [ he is singing !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qozqhh0vmpe ), 
  no , keep on consuming !, 
  yeah but russia 's gas is much appreciated . 
  maybe if there was a stream of it through the nord of europe ... 
  how do you draw your saber in a crowd ? 
  i guess they google translated everything from russian to dutch and some parts came out legible . 
  yeah , bff . 
  we even let them bring their hostages here and nukes . 
  they would n't attack neutral germany , would they ? 
  if only turkey would n't steal our oil !, 
   they 're `` afraid '' of the secure camp site that uses fingerprints for entry to ensure their safety . 
  first the hyphenated `` afraid '' part sounds exaggerated and second you omitted their crucial concern , that they might be forced to register in france and thus losing the opportunity to finally reach the uk . 
  very well . 
   but many migrants are reluctant to leave the tents , caf\u00e9s and shops they have set up in the jungle , and are suspicious about the new camp , which is surrounded by barbed wire and requires a fingerprint scan to come and go . 
   the migrants are also concerned that if they move into the new facility , they will be forced to apply for asylum in france , according to volunteer aid workers . 
  you did n't read the article , idiot . 
  oh , look at this guy from hungarydin nutg . 
  what a know-it-all . 
  it 's an access point to the mediterranean sea . 
  i would n't have given it up either . 
  same with the harbour in syria .
