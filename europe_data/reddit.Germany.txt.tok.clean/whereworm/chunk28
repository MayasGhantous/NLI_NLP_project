  well , not complete bs . 
  the german and most probably the dutch search terms are correct . 
  alas , google ca n't provide a sufficient answer . 
  did they have a passage like that in there ? 
  yeah , for striking a deal with libya by rescuing people at their coast and bringing them safely on the nearest land , instead of frontex watertaxiing them from international waters at the northafrican coast directly to eu mainland . 
  there is no substance to the article or what merkel said . 
   we did mistakes in the past nothing about a solution to the problems we have due to those mistakes . 
   it 's simply incorrect to say that terrorism came only with the refugees , nobody said that . 
  what people are concerned about is , that terrorism comes with unregistered , illegal immigrants . 
   germany will remain germany . 
  germany is changing .

  yes, 
  well , all in all it was supposed to be a joke , you know , in the wehrmacht fighting for the nazis and such , but some people like their monarchs , others are truly european . 
  so what ? 
  both of my grandfathers were voluntarily enlisted in the army and guess what they got !, 
  stupid greeks do n't even see this : you got ta spend ^ ^ ^ your money to make ^ ^ ^ our money . 
  your comment led me to learn this :  one of the main sources of confusion about [ clausewitz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_von_clausewitz#interpretation_and_misinterpretation ) 's approach lies in his dialectical method of presentation . 
  for example , clausewitz 's famous line that `` war is a mere continuation of politics by other means , '' ( `` der krieg ist eine blo\u00dfe fortsetzung der politik mit anderen mitteln '' ) while accurate as far as it goes , was not intended as a statement of fact . 
  it is the antithesis in a dialectical argument whose thesis is the point -- made earlier in the analysis -- that `` war is nothing but a duel [ or wrestling match , a better translation of the german zweikampf ] on a larger scale . '', 
  his synthesis , which resolves the deficiencies of these two bold statements , says that war is neither `` nothing but '' an act of brute force nor `` merely '' a rational act of politics or policy . 
  this synthesis lies in his `` fascinating trinity '' [ wunderliche dreifaltigkeit ] : a dynamic , inherently unstable interaction of the forces of violent emotion , chance , and rational calculation . 
  and not letting non-refugees in , that 's an option for australia . 
  dunno about the option of protecting your own border and not driving your ships to the indonesian border to take up everybody in a free water taxi . 
  after all we did last time , maybe we should * really * do something this time . 
  well uk is a net payer , so all `` hidden advantages '' aside the math should add up . 
  you paid more to the eu , than you got in subsidies and such or what does a country make a net payer ? 
  we already are !, 
  can we do something to change the future for the better by doing something else ? 
  like , going all stauffenberg on erdogan ? 
  converting to islam ? 
  securing the power of our dear leader over the south north korean sea ?

  you do not need to love the murdering part of your family , though . 
  yeah , we hope you die soon and if you did n't vote to leave , we would have killed you by now . 
  this is one of the reasons you prolonged the trident program and bought those attack helicopters . 
  you do n't live near a border , do you ? 
  it 's a pain in the ass , when you grew up with schengen . 
  we need working border controls outside of the schengen area and if there is a problem we should stick to the rules , not inviting everybody in . 
  ( do n't give me that markplatz post about merkel not inviting everybody in . 
  he just jumps over the important part with many details as a disguise . ),

  we the germans do and unfortunately the voters seem to forget everything immediately after they complained about it . 
  because we vote for them . 
  * [ dumb ] ( https://www.reddit.com/user/manthew ) with a b at the end . 
  i 'm stunned by the number of redditors in / r/europe defending the installation of a military dictatorship , but you ca n't even distinguish between treason by members of the military attempting a coup d'etat and driving a truck . 
  who did n't ever done something like that ? 
  nobody that 's who . 
  [ mostly german page .

   if necessary act against the government if it tries to replace the state of rights or the liberalistic democratic order . 
   a government that tries to dissolve the rule of rights ( in germany ) ~ ~ let 's say under these conditions soldiers ca n't be called traitors . ~ ~ phrasing !, 
  let 's say under these conditions the soldiers who decided to take part in the yesterday 's military coup in turkey ca n't be called traitors . 
  besides the point if the turkish soldiers are traitors , can a soldier or any judicial layman decide , when these terms are met ? 
  but more importantly , since it would refer to our discussion , and under the assumption that turkey has similar laws , would these conditions be met yesterday evening in turkey ? 
  real refugees use choppers !, 
  if there is no reason for asylum , of course they can deny it . 
  criminals can be sent back .
