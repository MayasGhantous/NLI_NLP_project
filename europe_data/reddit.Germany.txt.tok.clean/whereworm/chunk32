  on the other hand , i do n't know , if lying in front of the un about whatever incidents happened in some country , as the us did in both iraq wars , or ignoring it in the first place does any better . 
  no war within eu borders . 
  it 's not like no eu country has ever waged war outside of european union borders . 
  some of us do n't even need an un mandate to justify a war . 
  1 $ for an energy refill sounds like a good deal . 
  do they ship to germany ? 
  you mean the german maut ? 
  communists and suv environmentalists voted against it . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.bundestag.de/parlament/plenum/abstimmung/abstimmung?id=458 ) is the vote on the last change in the law . 
  there is no such thing as a `` boat tunnel '' . 
  the first sentence in the wikipedia article say it is is a `` schiffstunnel '' ( = ship tunnel ) , which links to the english page for [ canal tunnel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canal_tunnel ) . 
  on that page several existing examples are given for that old and lame technology , among which is the norwegian project of this well established and long existing infrastructure . 
  in germany , e.g. 
  in [ weilburg ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/weilburger_schifffahrtstunnel ), 
  i 've never seen rear mirrors on a train before . 
  how fast does it go ? 
  never heard that one . 
  remember that guy who got his arm stuck between rocks while climbing ? 
  he had to cut his arm off to survive . 
   no one has a wmd in his home like he has a knife . 
  to include the availability of the weapon in the comparison was your idea , i never did it . 
  i try to rephrase my whole point again . 
  you are in favour [ against constriction ] of legal ownership of certain guns . 
  your argument was , ownership of these guns should be allowed , because people have a [ far less dangerous ] item [ butter knife ] in their household , which they could use to kill a person . 
  so i chipped in and said ` well then we could allow the ownership of another dangerous weapon , because people have a [ far less dangerous ] item in their household , which they could use to kill a person . ', 
  until now i have n't heard a counter argument from your point , e.g. 
  where you would draw the line , what should be legal . 
  somewhere between guns and wmds/b -2 s i understand . 
  but it 's late , i 'm off . 
  i need my safe and peaceful sleep . 
  you compared a butter knife with guns , so i compared guns with wmds . 
  both comparisons lag to a huge extend . 
  i chose the ludicrous wmds to stress that point . 
  also , i believe a bomber does n't count as a wmd . 
  but is n't it also a big step from a butter knife to a gun ? 
  your argument against the stricter gun laws was , that it is not the weapon that is dangerous , but the person using it , by contradicting ` guns kill people ' with ` people kill people ' . 
  in the next sentence you gave an example by stating that one could even use a butter knife to kill someone . 
  and now my contradiction : if it is true , what you said , i.e. 
  that the danger comes only from the person owing/using the weapon . 
  then the kind of weapon does n't matter . 
  and therefore the weapon could even be something ridiculously exaggerated to make the invalidity of that statement obvious , such as wmds . 
  and guns are no  machette or a butter knife for all i know . 
  i was using your argument for guns and extrapolated it to wmds , without changing your argument . 
  thus , if it 's not valid for wmds , it 's not valid for guns . 
  it lacks at least some kind of constraint . 
  with your argumentation we could make weapons of mass destruction legal . 
  only bad people will use them in a illegal act , who could use a knife anyway . 
  good people are responsible enough to handle them . 
   cut politicians income what i meant was the income of the parties . 
  being able to determine your own salary is one thing , but with a predominant obligation to vote according to your party ( fraktionszwang ) , i ca n't imagine that change would be the result of consequences on an individual basis . 
  one good thing about the part-time communists ( and greens ) is , that they inform me , the interested voter , about my government by `` kleinen/gro \u00dfen anfragen '' . 
  the result is often an unpleasant truth , which would not have come to my attention otherwise . 
  but my impression of their work as opposition party is being opposed to everything , no matter what . 
  bringing peace by opposing to bring war to others is most honourable , but asking to quit nato , because it [ ` could reduce russia 's ability for a nuclear retaliation ' ] ( https://www.die-linke.de/die-linke/wahlen/archiv/archiv-bundestagswahl-2013/positionen/stichworte-von-a-bis-z/i-o/nato/ ) is ridiculous . 
  on top of that are individuals who ask for an abolition of the bundeswehr . 
  another thing is their stance on refugees and actually everything concerning foreigners . 
  if a interview or a speech comes to my attention , it is unconditionally in favour of the seemingly weak . 
  that gives me the impression , that they do n't think delicate topics through , but show knee-jerk reactions . 
  i 'm still leaning towards `` sonstige '' and thus helping to manifest the status quo . 
  although churchill excluded the uk of this union , did n't he ? 
  so selfish . 
  most selfish act since a certain point in time , not since the most selfish act until now . 
  the only way to show parties how dissatisfied one is with their work is to reduce their income , imo . 
  the only way to do so , is to get another party over the 5 % threshold , since they get their percentage of valid votes in money . 
  the pirate party seemed to be a good option , until they opened their mouth about topics beyond the concern of up-to-date-technology . 
  i do n't refrain from voting afd per se , but their stance on the eu is not worth discussing . 
  their dealing with the questionable vocabulary of members could be more determined , but ca n't be won or done well enough in `` public '' opinion , anyway . 
  so , what to do ? 
  help the cdu majority guarantor , tax reduction for hoteliers at any cost , gay-is-modern fun party fdp ? 
  keeping your vote secret and vote for the `` my suv is a hybrid , how did you save the world on facebook today '' - cdu in green ? 
  go full retard and commit seppuku with the sed ? 
  ah man , [ you bet me to it . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xetlzfi71hm ), 
  easy , we just unite all nations . 
  a united europe even ? 
  just kick out olanda . 
  that 's what i expect as well . 
  an alternative scenario could be to promise no net increase in cost and increase tax and toll after the election . 
  google gives me : kurva croat . 
  = whore engl . 
  kurva croat . 
  we should make both of them speak german again . 
   the first person rescued from a gondola told fire fighters : `` there are dozens of us ... 
  dozens . '', 
  just like data preservation , only to be used against terrorists ... and child molesters ... and murderers and for traffic violations . 
  biometric photo in passports ? 
  do n't let that information go to waste !, 
  the introduction of a mechanism is a big hurdle . 
  it 's expansion can be done in small steps , too small to care about . 
  new ways of communication demand a necessary way of intervening by the state , no question , but i think it should be monitored very carefully , because the forces introducing such a system might miss an advisable sensitivity . 
  we might not have to deal with that , if we pay attention to every little step we 're going in that direction . 
  restriction of freedom wo n't come in a big , easily recognizable leap . 
  good thing , that the hate speeches of jan hus were censored . 
  in your link it 's not the lowest , albanians have the lowest . 
  where is what on those maps ? 
  more radiation , less yield in crops ? 
  so the future is left ? 
  or is it a comparison between two the models and show a change in radiation ? 
  which model is where ? 
  this data presentation is a guessing game .
