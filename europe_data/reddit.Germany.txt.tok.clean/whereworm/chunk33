  well , did you start a war with them ? 
  like a pig at clockwork , in german . 
  you ca n't spell eu without you . 
  one of the best spiegel articles i 've ever read . 
  sober information and the motivation for possibly questionable police actions are presented . 
  if there was a newspaper or magazine full of articles like this , i 'd even pay money for it . 
  the author must 've started after brexit , refugees and pegida . 
  sounds more like a european army to me , than a joke . 
  if somebody acquired a single new citizenship , then he is to be treated as any other citizen . 
  if not , then not . 
  it 's not a summit , is n't it ? 
  that would have to be unanimous , but with uk not attending it is ... different , i read . 
  your comment used every letter in the english alphabet !, 
  to celebrate the occasion , here 's some free reddit silver !, 
   after a few years what are you talking about ? 
  [ 2020 it might be . 
  some air traffic controllers ca n't delay their retirement past 2018 . 
  then we might not have enough air traffic controllers until 2020 . 
  those are the guys with the [ european overtone ( guttural ) singing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwvcmvbgcpa&amp;t=49s ) . 
  i never zip my jeans to the top , i 'm more albanian than i thought . 
  same product , same price , is ok ? 
  since when is the united kingdom called great britain ? 
  that 's the german writing and pronunciation . 
  you wo n't be the last . 
  can i have some pineapple with that ? 
  you better watch your mouth , boy . 
  swamp germans are still germans !, 
  the stepdad had me ? 
  mmh , orange wine concentrato spritzer . 
  we are germans living in germany speaking german . 
  it should n't strike anybody as odd , that we use a german word for it . 
  at the end , your countress * does * know what tagliatelle are , she just does n't know the italian word for it . 
  and no korinthen kacken about breitbandnudeln or something . 
  the average supermarket in germany sells the spaghetti bolognese on the right as well . 
  \u00d6h , like this : \\ [ addres \\ ( s \\ ) \\ ] \\ ( text \\ ) i just copy-pasted it to be honest . 
  edit : wait no , the other way around . \\ [ text \\ ] \\ ( addres \\ ( s \\ ) \\ ) actually , the post looks like this , dunno how it did it : did you mean \\ [ this \\ ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_london_%281839%29 ) ? 
   your 5 $ bottle of wine in spain would n't be a 5 $ one in france . 
  no , because you smash the bottles as soon they cross the border . 
  we ca n't even agree on the fruit that goes into wine ? 
  poor europe . 
  btw , best wine in germany is italian , but it comes with a terrible price . 
  you have to spend about 15 $ on a pizza taxi to get it . 
   made me replace trump by hawaiian pizza i do n't get it . 
  i still see trump , no delicious pizza . 
  edit : ohh , now i get it . 
  ok : eu is germany, 
  so , i conclude : * chopin = french * curie = french * kopernikus = german * mozart = austrian * godwin = german * columbus = spanish * columbo = italian * death camps = polish, 
  ass shower almost touching tooth brush ? 
  it 's so some frenchie can call you civilized on the internet . 
  [ i agree ] ( https://i.imgur.com/sp0th7n.jpg ) , diversity is not always bad . 
  did you mean [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_london_%281839%29 ) ? 
  oh , right . 
  unfortunately , i live in a part of germany that does n't know how to make currywurst . 
   you have one empire and they never let you forget ugh , that 's the worst . 
  where are those `` traditional german fast food joint '' ? 
  all i can get is rubber meat pulp d\u00f6ner . 
  not even a gyros pita with actual pieces of meat in it . 
  first of all , no real german calls anything kartoffelstampf . 
  second , those are no stampfkartoffeln . 
  [ better get checked . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzizjjy_fg&amp;t=21s ), 
  i guess it 's easier for people , who natively speak languages with a differing accusative flection . 
  that does n't make it any better . 
  \u00feo and \u00fe\u00e5t maybe ? 
  and we do numbers the french way . 
  $ nglish is best english . 
  in the case the uk leaves eu within the next 50 years , we should change some smaller details in the official eu language english . 
  when they rejoin in 51 years , they 'll be really annoyed . 
  those seasoned with laxative as well ? 
  i think they mean the post on which the catcher counts and the others have to touch to be out of the game . 
  but it only counts , if you call `` frei '' while touching . 
  when you call `` frei f\u00fcr alle '' , the catcher has to count again , after 15 minutes of arguing , if you play with this rule . 
  and obama was afraid of a cowboy hat ... 
  i did , but that just reminds me of [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eviyrrjtty ) . 
  atat\u00fcrk was rather post-military junta greek , anyway . 
  well , you could resettle them armenian style . 
  totally a ok . 
  in the article it 's said , that the primary goal is to get the traffickers and their boats . 
  ( actually only the boats `` identify , capture and immobilise ships '' ) additionally they rescue people . 
  before this mission , did n't they do the same thing ? 
  maybe their primary goal was to safe people , but i ca n't imagine , they 'd let the trafficker go back with his boat . 
  assuming he would be aboard . 
  in the end , what 's different from before ? 
  more police work to get the trafficker on the libyan mainland ? 
   `` our specific mandate is to identify , capture and immobilise ships carrying illegal immigrants , not to save lives at sea , '' said scopigno . 
   `` however , '' he added , `` it is our legal and moral obligation to save anyone [ ... ] so , what 's the difference then ? 
  and why does the libyan navy general claim eu is using the `` ban on access to libyan territorial waters as an excuse '' ? 
  is there a alternative to the ` water taxi operations ' ? 
  that 's why the romans built the wall . 
  the other 100-500 people are commuters . 
  his name is elefant . 
  we say `` smoking like a chimney '' . 
  you should unite your countries to slovachechia or something . 
  arte broadcasts in different languages , german * and * french . 
  wait a second !, 
  i just cited you . 
   we [ the finnish ] did [ ... ] hitler . 
  total losers . 
   finns seem like slow dumb retards, 
  duh , everybody nows * that * guy .
