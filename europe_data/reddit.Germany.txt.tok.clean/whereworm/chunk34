  we tried to help our european brethren with that . 
  we love them like family . 
  but they mocked us and called it scorched earth . 
  can we just say georgia , eurasia second ? 
  * so / u/shootinganelephant is technically correct , the best kind of correct . 
  well , let 's say [ they 're alright ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwpagb-_zk0&amp;t=1m27s ) . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  you get snails in every supermarket and every other better restaurant . 
  everybody is disappointed by belgium . 
  if you 'd accepted some `` expats '' last year , maybe they would 've voted for you . 
  his `` a `` s could be more precise , otherwise it 's ok . 
  n in total ? 
  totale katastrophe !, 
  your nuclear plants explode more often than those . 
  i hope their sense of orientation is better than that of the british . 
  the sprinklers are not efficient enough !, 
  we need few more months to install bigger tubes . 
  was totally not foreseeable . 
  no way . 
  yes , salzburg was n't part of austria back then . 
  he was more german than austrian . 
  neither was mozart . 
  what 's so bad about north korea ? 
  they have a great wall on their southern border . 
  must 've cost some other guys a fortune . 
  you made a yuge mistake by showing moldova on a map . 
  prepare for the upcoming surgically precise bomb carpets . 
  i also saw a great wall left of that river at the end . 
  whom did you make pay for it ? 
  romanians ? 
  i know who 's coming 27th . 
  he does n't read them , you have to brief him on them . 
  that 's koitus in german . 
  from [ this ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-46169502.html ) article is the only thing i found . 
  i could n't find the citation in german . 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/luftschlacht_um_england#deutscher_operationsplan ) . 
  citation might be wrong !, 
  high bridges train no energy brakes . 
  central europe sucks the pp out of it 's limbs !, 
  be glad about it . 
  otherwise you 'd get wallonia . 
  [ it 's finnish . 
  bremskraft ? 
  til there are gb , go and gt, 
  stereotypes are n't damaging , in my opinion . 
  they are necessary to break down the complexity of the world . 
  prejudices are the problem . 
  how about a tariff on genetically mutated crops and shitty cars ? 
  they know south korea 's border very well . 
  ai n't there a region called south tyrol in italy ? 
  `` i do n't believe in windows , but i love high ceilings . '', 
  `` say no more , fam ! '', 
   the basic idea is to pay it by raising income tax , so at certain point of income you become `` income tax neutral '' that alone wo n't be sufficient . 
  above the break even point there have to be people who pay more than before , i.e. 
  getting overall less than before , to compensate for the people below the break-even-point . 
  in that way basic income is a form of redistribution from people with income to people without . 
  i see why people are skeptical . 
  normally , you 'd get nothing and work for your money . 
  if you lose your job , the unemployment benefits chip in . 
  when you find a job again , the benefits stop and you sustain yourself . 
  with this experiment you work and get benefits . 
  if you lose your job you still get the benefits . 
  when you find a job again , you still get the benefits . 
  where does the additional money come from ? 
  especially if this is supposed to work on a countrywide scale . 
  if a beneficiary gets a full-time position , the payment stops ? 
  i 'll take full-time minus 1h please . 
  how do they plan to adjust for inflation ? 
  do people have to beg for it , if the money is n't enough for a ( decent ) living in 10 years ? 
  glorious !, 
  we will scold you bad . 
  but , if the only solution to unwanted migration , the eu can agree on , is asking our neighbours to take care of it , we do n't deserve better as to be their bitches . 
  getting rid of the cause of migration in the source countries in the long term is one thing , e.g. 
  to stop waging war in them , but being unwilling to do something against an immediate problem at the borders is embarrassing . 
  there is also one in [ friesach , austria ] ( http://burgbau.at/burgbaufrie/?page_id=428 ) and in [ messkirch , germany ] ( http://www.campus-galli.de/ ) . 
  do n't encourage him !, 
  had the same effect as a ban of the german version , though . 
  the english version was available outside of germany and could be brought as a souvenir . 
  they fooled us twice , shame on us . 
  belgium played the agent provocateur twice , with their weak military displaying their `` neutrality '' at the border . 
  what were we supposed to do ? 
  be careful there !, 
  belgians typically have some kind of defence pact that 'll turn any fun world death match into a world team death match , which kinda sucks . 
  but if you could do away with those pestilent luxembourgers , you wo n't find me ungrateful . 
  fine , we just make our own special square , with austria and it 's parking place . 
  what i do n't get : is it the ps members voting for their candidate for presidency ? 
  the sub 's rules ask for an english translation . 
  paywalled and non-english submissions allowed so long as the complete content of the article ( in english ) is posted in the comment section . 
  how do you pay in a bakery ? 
  they always ask for change in germany . 
  so ... we all speak french now ? 
  just move to italy after retirement and your final age is off the chart . 
  hi rogerdogermoger , i 'm dad . 
  the memorial became an iconic installation for berlin and thus a ( free ) tourist attraction . 
  for many people there 's no difference to the [ hundertwasserhaus in vienna ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hundertwasserhaus ) or [ manneken pis in bussels ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manneken_pis ) , i suppose . 
  i think of it differently . 
  if you build such a large thing where people live , you ca n't expect that people stop their everyday lives around this place . 
  but it can get every other everyday-person to reflect for a moment in their everyday lives . 
  dancing on a grave is one thing . 
  embedding a memorial , which is n't built on top of a mass grave , but in the middle of a city , in your everyday life is another .
