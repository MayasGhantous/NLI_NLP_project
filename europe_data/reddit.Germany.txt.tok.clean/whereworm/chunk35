  i have n't been there and ca n't judge how cheerful and inappropriate these people act , but keep in mind , that it is n't a cemetery where people come to mourn , it 's a memorial . 
  i like that people integrate the memorial and in that sense the holocaust as a part of their country 's history in their everyday lives . 
  complaining that people do not remember in a standardized , visibly unambiguous and grief feigning way is presumptuous . 
  nobody can tell me how to cope with death . 
  not with my dead grandmother and not with million dead from over seventy years ago . 
  you wanted to have it , now deal with it . 
  no backsies !, 
  * mr. alright, 
  is that the same speed those lazy east europeans are working during harvest , or is it even faster ? 
  yes , it prevents water from the ocean being blown up the river by wind . 
  they build close to the water , because people want to live and work in the city and they are/were stupid . 
  oh , right , the bomb . 
  i forgot about the bomb . 
  that was dangerously reckless . 
  he even made sure , that they were geographically separated of the general population . 
  how precautious of him . 
  it 's like hunting in a zoo . 
  i do n't mind some dents in the buffers . 
  what about germany vs the world ? 
  everybody uses the term [ ` merkel suspended dublin ' ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/germany-suspends-dublin-rules-for-syrians/a-18671698 ) . 
  do n't try to twist this into an `` argument '' . 
  i think the political correct expression is `` east european death camps '' . 
  they 've occupied some argentine islands . 
  i 'm astounded by the amount of germans that really believe , that there wo n't be an unforeseeable rise in cost shortly after the introduction of the toll . 
  this would be the first time politicians would n't tap a source of money . 
  and if there are some borderline germans who decided to work in a foreign country with a street toll , then let them work their . 
  it was their decision . 
  do n't demand a reimbursement from me , living in the middle of germany . 
  right , there are reasons to call that area ce and others to call it ee . 
  if you divide europe in `` left and right '' there is no central part . 
  i 'd say insisting on one or the other is like fighting windmills . 
  even the ce section mentions the overlap o both expressions . 
   the term `` central europe '' is often used by historians to designate states formerly belonging to the holy roman empire or the polish-lithuanian commonwealth , including parts of modern-day belarus and ukraine . 
  `` central europe '' thus overlaps with `` eastern europe . '', 
  the following countries are labeled eastern european by some commentators and as central european by others . 
   our government is extremly socialist pis is `` extremely socialist '' ? 
  [ not everyone is ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_europe#international_organisations ) , especially un and eu . 
  do you mean vegans ? 
  from time to time people post in other languages and offer a translation in the comments , do n't they ? 
  i 'd appreciate a non independent , non uk view on objective journalism . 
  if there 's an english link , it 'll find it 's way to the top comment . 
  an english title would be great , though . 
  get out of/involved in it !, 
  4 min video without any important information . 
  is everybody who helps jailed ? 
  if not , why those three spaniards ? 
  did they pick the refugees up at the turkish coast ? 
  what did they do wrong/differently than others ? 
  [ this ] ( http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/images/crapart5.jpg ) is much better . 
  yes , germany is correct !, 
  if hofer had won , they would just repeat the election once again . 
  it could gain momentum , potentially . 
  hahaha `` paid time off '' . 
  and i 'm glad that it is finally settled : * we * have the better passports . 
  actually paid time off is pretty good ... 
  looks like a church [ these ] ( https://media.outnow.ch/movies/bilder/2005/adamsaebler/movie.fs/07.jpg ) guys would live in . 
  let 's say it 's not an obstacle . 
  that 's already promised to the nhs . 
  no , once you have a paying member in your club , the worst thing he can do is to go and pay money to another club . 
  the abrahamic religions implemented that in their scribblings . 
  thou shalt always pay taxes to eu nations . 
  i do n't speak finnish , but i 've got a hunch what they want from me .

  over 90 % of the yellow bin waste is `` energetically recycled '' . 
  i do n't know about the other countries on the list , but in germany burning means recycling . 
  it 's one half of it . 
  they can use the bridge between denmark and sweden . 
  close enough , you would have gotten your beers . 
  seven years , that 's an increase worthy to riot against . 
  lithuania has a common border with poland . 
  why wo n't you drive through russia ? 
  it 's part of an amazing europe . 
   retirement age was increased by 7 years . 
  `` wow , that 's a lot , i 'd be pissed , too . 
   from 56 to 63 ... 
  let 's research how to do that !, 
  and i 'm pretty sure austerity concerning the greek state had no effect whatsoever on greek cities , villages and greeks themselves . 
  merkel and sch\u00e4uble did n't lie , [ it 's not a haircut . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzspbzxjgw0 ), 
  they still do . 
  where they wo n't repair their autobahn bridge , but slap a 80km/h speed limit on it and speed cameras . 
  if the majority of the people voting for you have the same occupation , you might not want to anger these people too much , do you ? 
  [ did you see any cows around here ?

  they promised her `` bl\u00fchende landschaften '' and a safe pension in syria .

  ns iii would render western europe completely exposed to irish arbitrariness . 
  i do n't like either of you . 
   people who apply different standards to friends and foe yeah , that is totally not part of human nature . 
  these monsters . 
  what year is that from ?
