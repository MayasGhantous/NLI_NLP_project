  falsche generation . 
  no , but we do n't have a poverty problem . 
  because we like to laugh at them , when we see them struggle under the mount of muslims . 
  it 's like spraying ants with black paint . 
  the paint is flammable and it is easy to ignite . 
  it 's fun to watch the ants struggle for a bit and if the paint does n't ignite it just suffocates the ants . 
  duuh , poverty problem ? 
  is not enough poverty a problem ? 
  yeah , spanish people , but he is american , he kills blacks . 
  no , sarcasm is obvious and clear . 
  people should learn to deal with the medium internet . 
  too much d\u00f6ner , not enough gyros !, 
  russia is pending , actually helping against isis , pedophiles was vetoed by the uk and aids is almost practically cured . 
  i guess we are done here , may as well proclaim paradise , except ireland . 
  why does the polish guy always wear sunglasses ? 
  '' on a german layout, 
  can i park my tractor in the middle of the street downtown paris ? 
   it is better to stay out of it and let them fight it out . 
  not if their population flees to europe . 
  like angela ? 
  next time you should take the time and completely unfold the ballot . 
  for the unity of europe i 'd like to say : yo , cheese feet !, 
  if you ever feel the need to flee towards us , i 'd take you in , even if it were the zwarte piet . 
  but then again , why would you flee towards us ? 
  the frogs are n't * that * repelling . 
  first publication sung by [ lale andersen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8btnyydbkqq ) . 
  i did n't expect to find a german contribution to this post.your flair is n't too obvious either . 
  while i typed my last answer , i already thought about the question if the guest workers were bad for germany . 
  i do n't think , that anybody can say so . 
  they came after we invited them and we did that , because there was a demand for workers . 
  our economy could n't have grown that fast , if at all to the same amount , if there were n't enough workers when the times demanded them . 
  the first and second wave of guest workers were spaniards and italians ( 50s ,60 s ) , that 's how the pizza and italian cuisine got so prevalent in germany . 
  you find italian restaurants everywhere , nobody questions them , but there are almost no italians . 
  third and fourth generation of `` them '' do n't stick out in any way , they are part of the germans now . 
  after that there came a lot of poles ( 70s ,80 s i think ) , same thing . 
  and then , when the steel industry was already on the decline some turks came ( 70s ,80 s as well ) . 
  i do n't really know if there was still a guest worker agenda of the state in this case and i could n't distinguish between times poles and turks came over . 
  poles do n't stick out of the public . 
  some turks do . 
  that 's why they are used as a negative example of migration and people claim that they did n't merge with our society . 
  but this is not true from my experience . 
  the ones i know do n't speak that turkish slang , which let 's anybody recognize you as an lower class person . 
  women do n't wear headscarfs or worse , their mothers , grandmothers often do though . 
  the whole point is , that if you recognize somebody as a ( german ) turk , than they are lower class and behave accordingly . 
  the good ones either do n't stick out , or you 'd be glad if their child attended the same kindergarden as yours . 
  the conservative german today kind off insists of going to the italian restaurant and not to the turkish . 
  today the industries which attracted guest workers are practically dead , coal mining subsidies run out in 2017 , steel industry , who needed coal , moved to eastern europe and china . 
  this results in the highest unemployment rates in germany in the affected region , higher than in eastern germany . 
  funny enough , these regions are accustomed to rather muslim like foreigners , so they are not the ones protesting . 
  ( germanturks are as muslim , as germans are christian . 
  there is a piece of paper which proves it , but as soon as you have to pay your church tax you marry in a nice church and quit . 
  the hardcore christians in germany attend church on christmas * and * easter ) the question of education is , if they can work . 
  i 've read that they are legally allowed to do so after three months . 
  i suppose three months after their asylum is granted . 
  then you have to find an employer who is willing to employ someone who leaves again in few years . 
  although forbidden , this is a problem with female workers . 
  if you have a small company , where there are not enough people to fill in for a missing person , you ca n't employ a woman who plans to leave soon for a baby she gets . 
  totally understandable , although not said out loud . 
  it also takes some time and money to teach the new guy . 
  i assumed that they speak german , which is not the case and it takes more than three months to learn a language to a point , that you can communicate in a job which demands a higher education . 
  there is a law in germany that says , if there are two equally qualified applicants for a job , you have to take the german , but again , there are ways around that and people fear that the foreign worker is willing to work for lower standards , which would force those standards on the germans . 
  if they ca n't show their diploma , because they are n't entitled to asylum , then i hope we find out early enough to show him his way back . 
  if he is qualified for work and we need him , then he can migrate as any other person can . 
  i was told for usual migration you 'd need a very high paying job in germany . 
  i can imagine that this restriction is to make sure , that only highly educated come here . 
  the people i talked to about the refugee asylum thing are , if critical , not opposed to helping people who need help . 
  they are opposed to grant people asylum and thus granting them money , who just want a more luxurious life . 
  that is the reason , that they are opposed to letting asylants choose to what country they get , because there are countries where they are safe , but which are poorer than germany . 
  and living there is enough help to get away from the life threatening circumstances . 
  we can still talk about a distribution of money among the eu states , that it is not a disadvantage for the state to take refugees . 
  or block paris with your tractor . 
  or threaten to leave the eu . 
  4ish months , that 's about the time germans need to process an asylant 's application . 
  you wo n't do anything illegal , would you ? 
  two f-22 and two a-10s have the same effect on estonians as 200 refugees !, 
  children is plural , as is shores . 
  i 'd rather take the refugees than the activists . 
  ** to your article about arizona : ** they had undocumented people there and their economy adapted to this circumstance . 
  then they introduced a law , that made it illegal to be an undocumented immigrant . 
  whatever that means and how it was handled before . 
  and as a result , those people went missing , the food they consumed , the goods they bought , the tourism they , or maybe people who came to visit , all that stopped . 
  calculating this results in a minus . 
  for other states the minus came from the fact , * that it would cost money to teach the new law to police officers . 
  if you count that as an argument , then the best thing would be to abandon all laws . 
  * that seasonal workers could n't be found to bring in the harvest . 
  well , mr. farmer , if nobody wants to work for you , i.e. 
  if the demand is higher than the supply , what must happen then ? 
  maybe our cucumbers and carrots ca n't be sold at those cheap as prices , which come from a shitty payment or bad security . 
  in our case we do n't have these people here , already , so that minus would n't apply for us . 
  ** to germany 's reunification : ** i ca n't say what effect the east german workers had on the west german economy . 
  the effect would have been on the german economy after all . 
  what i can say is , that after the reunification we had to deal not only with the workers , but also with the east german economy from which they `` fled '' . 
  many factories , companies were n't fit for the international market and went bankrupt , which resulted in a high unemployment , still present today , except for two or three capitals and big cities . 
  the salaries paid by the state were the same after 15 or 20 or so years , the salaries paid by the private sector are still lower . 
  the reason they give is usually , that living , i.e. 
  rents are much cheaper in eastern germany . 
  all in all , as before , this is not comparable , because we got a country attached to ours , not just new people . 
  ** to the tax argument : ** taxes are designed in a way , that they roughly cover the expenditures of a state . 
  although , usually states take up new debts every year , but for `` good '' economic reasons . 
  in germany and i think in most states pensions are paid `` on the fly '' .
