  you do n't pay into an account and get your money from that later in life , but taxes today pay for pensions today . 
  if i get a pension tomorrow , my children will have to earn them . 
  you said chances are , that the asylant does n't need his pension anymore . 
  i do n't quite understand that . 
  if somebody works here and pays into the pension system , he is entitled to his pension no matter were he lives . 
  so even if the refugee could go back to his country , he will get his pension , because he paid for it . 
  you said chances are , that the asylant does n't need education . 
  that is only true if he already is educated , or his educational level is recognized in germany . 
  i do n't know what the numbers are on this point . 
  i know that at least not all russian university degrees are recognized and i know , that the highest school degree , which serves in germany as a admittance to study in a university , is not recognized from morocco . 
  so chances are , that somewhat of the education from syria is not recognized in germany , but i do n't know . 
  you said we should suppose all of the accepted asylants find jobs . 
  that 's a bold assumption . 
  if there are more people , you need more service jobs , as barbers and grocery stores , if the capacities we have are full . 
  but we ca n't live of cutting each other 's hair . 
  so jobs in the producing industry must be created , which are not there yet . 
  once they are created total numbers of produce , or the gdp/gnp from germany would have risen , but that does n't mean , that the gdp per inhabitant would have risen , which could be seen as a measure of wealth . 
  you said 90 % male means 90 % who are working , paying taxes and spending money in germany . 
  we had that several times several decades ago in germany with guest workers . 
  as the name implies they were invited to work in germany , basically in our steel and mining industry and were the supposed to leave . 
  what happened is , that they brought their families over , or sent the money home . 
  in the one case , there are no longer 90 % young male workers , in the other , the money does n't end up in our economy . 
  ** to the safe country route : ** there is a road with three houses . 
  a wooden shag , 1 room , bit dirty , a hostel 6 bed rooms , one shower and toilet for 36 people , not the nicest furniture inside and there is a palace , where you can get every luxury you want , warm nice meals cooked for you , your own bedroom , room service . 
  you yourself are living in the palace . 
  one day , a person in distress knocks at your door blood covered , ca n't really walk , underfed . 
  and this guy is begging for help , because his life is in danger and he needs medical attention . 
  and the good guy you are , anyway you have more than enough to give away , you let him in , tend to his wounds feed him . 
  suddenly the next guy knocks with his children and his wife , same story , heart breaking . 
  and you look down the road and see a horrible accident happened near the shag , a tragedy , an emergency . 
  but the victims do n't ask for help , do n't beg for saving their lives at the shag . 
  because it 's too dirty . 
  they simply pass the hostel , as if their lifes were n't in danger , because 5 other people might be snoring and a toilet for 36 ? 
  that smells in the morning . 
  no they are coming all to your doorstep the poor people , with their ill children and pregnant wives . 
  at some point you think to yourself `` are you kidding me ? 
  i would help you if you need help , but the fuck is this ? 
  fool me once shame on you , fool me twice shame on me ! '', 
  ** to the forefathers ** i do n't use that argument . 
  i am lucky that i was born here , yes . 
  was n't my decision , just happened . 
  what do you suggest rolling a dice for every newborn in what country to put them . 
  you ca n't be given a responsibility , you have to take it , you have to agree to be responsible . 
  just because i was born here , does n't mean i have to help , do , share anything . 
  if i do , it 's a favour , do n't want anything in return . 
  if i do n't , why should i ? 
  if there was a forefathers argument and that they could decide who gets their heritage . 
  who do you think they wanted to get it , their heirs , their children , or someone else . 
  ** to you shooting 1 mil hungarians ** do n't understand that one . 
  i guess that answers your last question . 
  or any points before . 
  i would like to mention , that i am all in favour to take refugees , i.e. 
  not all asylum seekers , but people who flee a war , or people who are persecuted because of their race or religion or something . 
  but it feels ungrateful to me , if you give somebody an inch , and he takes a mile . 
  we help , but our way , they ca n't choose where to go . 
  we should and will provide help , but only help , not more . 
   mamytes i only found lithuanian web sites , what does it mean ? 
  mommys ? 
  only if dad 's are # 1 !, 
  the long lasting oppression of men must end . 
  females are always named first !, 
  and i should start to think in english , in german you sa `` sehr geehrte damen und herren ! '', 
  ( dear madams and sirs ) . anyway , in german dad 's should be # 1 , the british male looks more like number 2 . 
  ah thank you , for finding that . 
  the last video beginner should see . 
  it is slightly eerie . 
  ok , might work in english , the first sentence is wrong . 
  i do n't know why it should be the last video , but it would be : das letzte video , dass anf\u00e4nger sehen sollten . 
  the last video , that beginners should see/watch . 
  complete gibberish . 
   the welfare money given to them is in return spent in our economy and paid to them by the state , who gets the money as a certain percentage of what it 's economy produces . 
  so all in all a negative balance . 
   they need housing - provided by germans as long as they receive welfare money it 's paid by the state  food , sold by german vendors and so on the same . 
   population will have declined to a total of 65 million inhabitants by 2050 and to -10 million in 2225 and to 170 million in 1805 , extrapolating the population development led konrad adenauer to defend our pension system with the argument , that we will always get children . 
  today you tell me the opposite is true . 
  you only mentioned a process of evaluating their degrees and eventually integrating them into the arbeitsmarkt . 
  you ignore the possibility of a negative evaluation . 
  refugees get the same money as welfare level . 
  are they allowed to work ? 
  are their degrees recognized ? 
  do they compete with locals on a similar level , or do they offer their labor under lower conditions . 
  does more wealth lead to more money spend in the same country the money is earned ? 
  our economy is great , does n't need boosting . 
  as far as i know , there is no way to enter germany legally and apply for asylum . 
  you ca n't do it at your embassy , you ca n't do it at the border . 
  i do n't know if that 's true , though . 
  i 'm pretty sure , that you can seek asylum in the usa , as snowden could in russia . 
  if you were as fucked as those people , you 'd find a way in the us . 
  being captured at your try to enter does n't matter , you do n't want to hide , you just want to be there . 
  still , i do n't see the point , why we have to let everybody in , just because they do n't like it enough in other safe countries . 
  and most of all i do n't like to being lied to , as in the example that the refugees could `` boost '' our economy . 
  talk to me seriously and honestly and i am the first one who is persuaded by good arguments . 
  for 20 $ a month even i would become a criminal . 
  where can i apply ? 
  when they boost economy ? 
  after you read the leftist party manifest . 
  when they get welfare ? 
  from day one . 
  ok , that explains something . 
  for example why there are so many vacant jobs in the south .
