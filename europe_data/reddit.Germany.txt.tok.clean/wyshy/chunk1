i just got up , we 're driving to ploce in 3 hours , holiday . 
  godfuckingdamnit . 
  vatican city ... srsly ? 
  1 owner , 841 tenants ? 
  i just default-upvoted every single pic , just because . 
  these threads rock . 
  late but kinda good : http://i.imgur.com/zztzpt5.jpg i made it in the netherlands last tuesday . 
  it 's all over the western countries , is n't it ? 
  my so will `` somehow '' wake up & go to work an hour too early tomorrow . 
   seriously you guys have been coming down here even throughout the yugoslav era my first time there was actually in the yugoslav era . 
  we had to turn around because of the bad condition of the streets ( ford granada & caravan ) someone else mentioned kupa some time ago , i think we 'll take a look on it . 
  can you go kayaking there ? 
  krka national park is firmly booked too !, 
  croatia is firmly booked for 2014 . 
  been there last year as well , but we had to turn around because of illness . 
  we 're regulars , been to bretagne two times last year . 
   while it feels less impressive than many of the others posted in this thread it does n't . 
  we 're into kayaking , so it could be even more fun . 
  are the tulip fields blooming all year long ? 
  or just in early spring ? 
  thanks for your input guys !, 
  i really appreciate that . 
  gas prices . 
  i am actually saarl\u00e4nder , so i had no chance of not posting my saarschleife . 
  thanks for your feedback . 
  i did some kayaking there - but not this time . 
  absolutly worth it . 
  not that much . 
  we spent 4000 $ in total . 
  2 persons . 
  / u/karvattatus already chose me , go away !, 
  been there done that !, 
  unfortunately it is n't as photogenic as the church steeple . 
  no time , much work , even more procrastination . 
  in hindsight kinda crazy , considering the stuff i missed . 
  we traveled about 44 days . 
  roadtrips only , never been to the same hotel for 2 nights . 
  12 countries , mostly for landscapes instead of big cities or history . 
  great adventure after not traveling between 2002 and 2012 . 
  10/10 would do again . 
  actually ... we 're planning our trips for 2014 right now . 
  only been in zeeland / south holland for a very short time . 
  so unfortunately no . 
  maybe this year . 
  so you just want to see some big towns in europe ? 
  and skip the space between them by taking the shortest route , no matter what 's in that `` gap '' ? 
  your route wo n't be fun . 
  too much travelling for the amount of sightseeing . 
  you skip so much . 
  tip : skip the western or the eastern part . 
  read about the countries that are left . 
  visit as much as you can do between the remaining 4 spots . 
  do it by car if possible . 
  source : 17000 kilometres of roadtrips in 2013 throughout europe . 
  yay , austrians a part of it . 
  not long ago a ( croatian ) truck tried to ram my trunk cause i was ( `` only '' ) going 45 in a 30 . 
  but to be fair ... things take time to evolve . 
  back in the 80s we had to turn around in croatia because our ford granada could n't handle the conditions of the roads . 
  swift driving with mutual respect whilst keeping track of the traffic , that 's what i experienced most . 
  in croatia and spain you get run over , in italy you get overtaken not only left and right but in 5 different dimensions and in my homeland germany i 'm waiting for the day everyone starts buying tanks instead of cars . 
  - belgium : great drivers . 
  did not expect this . 
  - france : freaking nice people . 
  - italy : why does n't everybody die the first day they come near a road ? 
  - austria : austrians are almost a minority here . 
  - switzerland : serious business wherever you go . 
  - croatia : always double the number on the speed limit sign or you will be honked at . 
  especially on the road down the coast . 
  - netherlands : too much kindness for my german soul . 
  - luxembourg : a small flat costs more than the entire gross national product of other countries . 
  - monaco : more police men than anywhere else on the world . 
  seriously , feels like personal bodyguards for everyone - slovenia : beautiful country , did n't expect this . 
  great alternative for holiday in the alps . 
  - spain : sleeps when you are awake , starts dancing when you ( think you ) want to sleep . 
  - liechtenstein : ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ apparently ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ best ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ way ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ get ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ into ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ switzerland ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ without ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ beeing ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ checked ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ by ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ customs ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ freak ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ me ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ out been to some more , but i think the ones above hit the spot . 
  it has it 's ups and downs . 
  the downside was/is the price-increase rate after the change from deutschmark to euro . 
  the big `` up '' of the eurozone is something most germans tend to forget : the strong german economy is partly owed to the circumstance that we are surrounded by countries with weaker economy . 
  that maybe is even worth the fact that germany pays a major part for the maintenance of the eu . 
  at first glance i was a little worried ... first picture looks like gangnam style, 
  til ... :-), 
  i really really hope you know what it means before you use it otherwise !, 
  same for every ( ? ), 
  other central/western european country, 
  first : pick the countries you would like to work in . 
  second : inform yourself about possible jobs in that countries . 
  germany or some skandinavian countries seem to be kinda appropriate for your b & ct degree . 
  third : search for actual jobs fourth : inform yourself about restrictions and paperwork you need to inform yourself / to do fifth : give it a shot sixth : learn the local language asap , have a basic knowledge before you get there cheers !, 
  serious answer : french people are n't ^ very ^ ^ popular , but the country itself is the most beautiful thing europe has to offer . 
  no time to answer , preparing for war , brb, 
  - will be wyshys next holiday residence as soon as i finished my boat skippers license, 
  croatia in the eu is definitly a good thing . 
  welcome !, 
  i 'd go for a german prepaid card and book that 300 mb package . 
  * do you decide on major sights or places to visit in advance or just start driving completely `` blind '' ? 
  * i 'm well informed about the region but i have nothing decided yet when we get there . 
  for example when we drive along a coastline i have a map i made myself where the different types of coast ( sand , high rocky coast , rocky coast but accessible , chalk cliffs ) are labeled because we like special types of coast were we can hang out / eat . 
  and i have a list of 5-7 cheap `` emergency hotels '' with 24/7 reception and bathtub if internet fails . 
  * have you ever found a blog post or wrote one how a typical day or week in a road trip looks like ? 
  * no , but i can tell you a typical day of us : - waking up somewhen between 4 am and 10 am ( 85 % hotel , 15 % car ) , shower - starting navigon and/or google maps , taking a look were the fuck we are .
