  and you continue to discriminate . 
  i am really sorry for you . 
  this conversation will be a lot of fun and i have plenty of time . 
  plenty . 
  and please write less in clear argumentation , it is a pain to read that . 
   you choose culture over the suffering of animals . 
  we all do that . 
  we all eat meat as a central part of our culture , and we want it cheap . 
  try talking to a buddhist about that issue . 
  he will tell you : `` you choose culture over the suffering of animals . '', 
   their pain . 
  their stress . 
  their fear . 
  their agony . 
  their helplessness . 
  ... crocodile tears , stupid appeal to emotions ... talk about fallacies . 
   it is a way to distract the debate and make it about me , not the issue at hand and you constantly try to move away from it . 
  i tell you again . 
  the issue here is not bull fighting , of which i am not an aficionado , and it never was . 
  the issue is that * you * discriminate people , and thus , yes , this issue is about * you * . 
   you make me sick . 
  then you might want to see a doctor , i see several reasons for you to do that . 
   how about nazi culture . 
  their culture to fuck up jews ? 
  again , i ask you the following question : do you put an animal 's life on the same level as a human one 's ? 
   fascist . 
  says the one who discriminates a whole country . 
  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ edit : here , let me show you your point from a different point of view :  [ look at that article !, 
  ] ( http://www.dutchdailynews.com/animal-cruelty/ ) wow . 
  how can you even like any dutch . 
  look at that [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5udbpkeujga ) . 
  vicious , disgusting practice and the first thing that comes to my mind when thinking about the netherlands . 
  how is this still possible in 2015 ? 
  what is wrong with people to do this ? 
  what kind of sick brain does one have to have to get money out of this ? 
  what does this tell about a country or at least an organizing city ? 
  a lot . 
  sweet , thank you . 
  it 's interesting to see that there is a gate in europe , open to a whole continent . 
  i tell you again that i am not defending bull fighting itself . 
  i am fighting the way that you discriminate others with loads of hypocrisy and foul language . 
  and yes , i would also do that if the situation would be * exactly * the same but with dog fighting . 
   i do n't give a shit about their interpretation , i see a animal suffering and being stabbed to death struggling for his life . 
  that has nothing to do with the fact that bull fighting is not liked because the animal is suffering . 
  that was my point and i guess i articulated it very clearly . 
  you mention hannibal , so am i right that you put a human life at the same level as an animal one 's ? 
  must suck when you step on a bug . 
  life sentence . 
  [ hemingway on bull fighting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/death_in_the_afternoon ) , but i guess he 's just another psychopath . 
  [ sells for a few millions . 
  ] ( http://www.damienhirst.com/the-black-sheep-with-golden-ho )  this is some tu quoque fallacy shit or something . 
  it does not make it right . 
  you are trying to move away from the issue buddy . 
  stop making up excuses . 
  so what is it now . 
  and you are correct , it does n't make it right and i am also against bull fighting . 
  but it shows the hypocrisy in the way that you judge other cultures and other people . 
  a way that can be described as fascist . 
  you neither care about bull fighting nor animals . 
  you just want to act like a self-righteous maniac . 
   haha , what a dumb setup to then give yourself a free pass to call somebody a hypocrite and again you try to shift the attention away from the issue . 
  you just did n't understand what the issue is . 
  not bull fighting , but your incitement of a people . 
   oh look at all that culture . 
  blood dripping out of his nose , standing all mighty and powerful over the animal in agony , before slaughtering an animal for entertainment . 
  you feel powerful now u/xpc77 ? 
  does that give you a hard one ? 
  you are a bull slaughtering apologist making up excuses for being cruel towards animals , now being as lame as hiding behind culture and what was that ? 
  haha . 
  clown . 
  defending this sick culture makes you a sick person . 
  check yourself out and try to look in the animals eyes you disturbed apologist . 
  show some fucking humanity . 
  finally we are at the fun part . 
  you see , there are some people with whom it is almost impossible to discuss an important and interesting topic . 
  you are one of them , and you could tell that right from your first comment , that is nothing but an obnoxious , polemic and primitive rant that insults others . 
  now you go against me . 
  some crocodile tears and fake emotions ( `` it 's bleeding from its mouth !, 
  look in its eyes ! '', 
  wow . ), 
  and some infantile offenses ( `` you feel powerful now ? 
  does that give you a hard one ? '' ), 
  and that 's basically it . 
  good one , my friend . 
   you have no shame . 
  i may have no shame . 
  but you have no decency . 
  nice article , but i disagree with his statement that madrid is n't a city for tourists . 
  it is exactly the same as every other big european city . 
  you walk around and see architecture , museums and historical stuff . 
  you eat good food , have good drinks , go shopping and if you do n't know what to do , you take a day trip somewhere else . 
  toledo , segovia , el escorial are max . 
  two hours away . 
  exactly the same as everywhere else , and madrid is great for these things . 
  probably a little big / spread . 
  see , the spaniards who like bullfighting do n't like it because the animal suffers . 
  they like it as an aesthetic form and a sport challenge . 
  just like hemingway did . 
  i 've already said that in another thread . 
  there is much more cruelty everywhere in the world towards animals that is much worse than bull fighting .
