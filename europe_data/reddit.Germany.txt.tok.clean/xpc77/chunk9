  plus , i hate cats . 
   as for today ukraine , please show wich atrocities russia is doing to the ukrainian population ... why not have a look at the un reports or amnesty or hrw ? 
  why do n't people trust poroshenko and yatsenyuk ? 
  edit : and the head of parliament ? 
  vergiss es . 
  * he [ roger brunet , frenchman and creator of the notion ] saw the blue banana as the result of historical development , for example important trade routes or the accumulation of industrial capital . 
  however , france did lose the connection to this area mainly because of the prosecution of minorities , he mentions the protestants , and the centralization of paris . 
  brunet willingly left the french area out , which concentrates or is restricted on paris , to show the french government the necessity of economical integration in this european area as a whole . 
  [ blue banana .

  wait a second . 
  ahh i see . 
  fair enough . 
  thanks buddy . 
  not at all . 
  it just shows that russia handles international affairs very poorly . 
  if ment honestly , they would have given it back along time ago , when there was no need to make a big deal out of it . 
  however , this is russia wanting to impress someone . 
  are greek people falling for this bullshit ? 
  ( edit : russia deals in the same way with german looted art . 
  http://www.dw.de/looted-art-overshadows-merkel-putin-meeting/a-16899402 ), 
  i love it . 
  it emphasizes the `` nordicness '' . 
  `` look at us , scandinavia , we even have * two * crosses ! '', 
  i will not do you that favor . 
  i have explained you twice in which way this was whataboutism . 
  that should be enough . 
  however , i did n't understand in which way said that russia was in the wrong ... 
  it is ok if you use nuclear warfare with this meaning . 
  however , the described scenario and hiroshima / nagasaki are still two different things . 
  second : `` but there is 0 indication that russia would ever use nukes on any cities like us has . '', 
  that is correct , but this is not what you initially said . 
  third : '' ... and us has armed the entire middle-east . '', 
  whataboutism again . 
  i do n't think that we are getting anywhere . 
  i wish you the very best . 
  as i told you before , your statement is not correct and the accusation of whataboutism is applicable because : * the us did n't start a nuclear war . 
  a russian nuclear attack , on the other hand , would do so . 
  * you are comparing two things that do n't have anything to with another . 
  an event in the past and a prediction of the future , like : `` nah , he could never be a criminal , the only criminals in this world are the criminals that exist right now ! '', 
  * you are not `` directly refuting or disproving the opponent 's initial argument '' . 
  ( by your definition . ), 
  you really dare to complain about an anti-russia circlejerk while doing an anti-america-putinbot-circlejerk . 
  that is just really , really dumb . 
  furthermore , i want to tell you one thing : saying the obvious truth about russia does n't make anyone in here an anti-russian . 
  and by the way : the initial commentator , michaelpapageorge , is using a classic putinbot argument / ideology : do n't fuck with the russian bear , because they are an oh so strong worldpower and the rest is just weak and gay . 
  fearmongering . 
  primitive . 
  did n't you see this ? 
  and to you : am i right that you suggest to do nothing at all ? 
  after they downed a passenger jet ? 
  yes ? 
  lol one troll against another . 
  to you : whataboutism in the worst way . 
  ( it has nothing to do with one another , it is seventy years later an it was n't even a nuclear war . ), 
  the allies took * huge * effort to `` denazify '' nazi-germany after ww2 . 
  the ideology was really deeply rooted . 
  when you see how the russian media talks and a majority of russians think , you can see how the putin-era will certainly not change over night . 
  does the japanese snake have chinky eyes as a characteristic attribute ? 
  ah , then putin is cool . 
  from `` chap '' to `` cunt '' in two hours . 
  not bad  i will look out for this guy , he never stood out to me before . 
  the whole poll concerning russia : [ trustworthy partners of germany . 
  ] ( http://www.infratest-dimap.de/typo3temp/pics/ard-deutschlandtrend_maerz2015_16_b79e721fbf.png ) ( blue : can traust , grey : can not trust . ), 
  [ will the ceasefire hold ? 
  ] ( http://www.infratest-dimap.de/typo3temp/pics/ard-deutschlandtrend_maerz2015_22_dc9c7021a4.png ) ( top : i think that the russian government increasingly violates democratic basic rights . 
  middle : the russian president agrees with every method to establish russian interests . 
  bottom : i can understand how russia feels threatend by the west . 
  blue : agree , grey : disagree . ), 
  it 's actually him before the face lift :d ( no , i 'm just kidding . 
  a german can not complain , i guess . ),

  fair enough , sure not as important as a proper economy , but putin , in my interpretation , thinks a little different there . 
  in the last decade , he never cared about exonomic or industrial reforms . 
  all he did was making sure that russia has its place among the world powers . 
  this correlates with his criticism of the usa , his actions against the eu , his role in the ukraine , his interpretation of the sovjet union etc. 
  but yeah , in order to survive , he might adapt a few things in his view on the world . 
  influence . 
  what did you get ? 
  ... is why i took the great nation of france . 
  reason : le pen not winning . 
  no need to call for violence . 
  just to put that in a perspective : goebbels never mentioned the word `` jew '' in any of his speeches , neither did he call for violence . 
  the discrimination of a people is also what falls under `` volksverhetzung '' , just like the denial and the following implications of a proven crime against a people . 
  another thing : putting `` i think that ... '' infront of an insult does n't undo the insult . 
  try it with a policeman . 
  this is your example ? 
  fuck , you have no idea what free speech is about . 
  just like every oligarch in russia . 
  even putin himself . 
  only difference : the yukos guys got in the way . 
  like nemzov , like choderowski , like so many others . 
  the us never accepted the icc , if i recall correctly . 
  russia , however , is a member of the european court . 
  and what about the un ? 
  i have no information about that . 
  well . 
  the main intention of this law is to avoid paying the billions of euros to the former owners of yukos . 
  furthermore , an international court would be quite useless , if everyone could just say : `` na , i do n't give a fuck . '',
