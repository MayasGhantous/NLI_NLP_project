you can exercise your right to self determination . 
  after that you will either be ridiculed or your former state will exercise their right to defend their territorial integrity . 
  [ honduras ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/flag_of_honduras.svg ), 
  yes , my argument was that it is possible to get through the period of ' 33 - '45 without joining the nazis , not that everybody did . 
  ( actually i wondered if i should mention a counterexample like [ kiesinger ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kiesinger ) who was a member of the nsdap from '33 and later also chancellor . ), 
  that depends , for example the first post war chancellor , [ adenauer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adenauer#years_under_nazi_regime ) , was mayor of cologne in the weimar republic . 
  he had to endure oppression , including a few month detention in 1944 , but nowhere near the level communists were treated . 
  another example would be [ willy brandt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/willy_brandt ) , who fled in 1933 to norway . 
  so there were ways around nazi prosecution . 
   i do n't recognise the imagined difference between the concepts of biological sex and gender . 
  in the upcoming justice league movie , wonder woman will wear a revealing outfit because of some biological property of the celluloid ? 
  i want to hear rush limbaugh 's rant when the us president gets thrown into the tower for touching the queen . 
   more people died under the soviets than nazi germany that is a fact . 
  no , it is actually quite hard to compare the number of dead attributable to the two regimes . 
  if you compare death as result of policy , then you have to count the 60 million dead in wwii as a result of hitler 's policy . 
  and if you narrow it to number of people who perished as a result of a deliberate extermination policy , well the soviet union never had such a policy . 
  so it is perhaps possible to find a definition that tip toes around the [ hungerplan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hunger_plan ) while keeping the victims of holodomor , but such a definition would be highly contrived . 
   so during peacetime soviets were killing millions , and nazi germany only resorted to it during wartime , i do n't see how stalin was better ? 
  see for example this discussion on the [ holodomor ] ( https://pay.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1b6arl/why_isnt_the_ukrainian_famine_of_3133_considered/c946lgh ) over at / r/askhistorians . 
  many of the victims of the soviet union died as a result of completely botched economic policies . 
  that does not mean , that there were no mass killings , for example the [ dekulakization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dekulakization ) , but there is at least the theoretical possibility that a kulak could denounce his class , unlike in the racial killings of the nazis . 
  as for the question if slovenians would be considered slavs , race is a social construction not a biological distinctions . 
  my guess is that a lot would depend on which chapters of rosenberg the local ss commander has read . 
  so both regimes were some of the worst in human history , but trying to figure out which one is worse is quite pointless i think , better than hitler is still pretty bad . 
   [ ... ] the ones that were taken captive by the soviets said they would rather have died or lived under hitlers rule than to be treated the way they were in soviet union . 
  [ bad decision ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generalplan_ost )  [ ... ] if you look at the pure numbers stalin killed so much more of his own men and civilians than hitler . 
  [ nope ] ( http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/mar/10/hitler-vs-stalin-who-killed-more/#fn-* ) so there is a reason that goodwin 's law exists , it is really hard to find any regime that is comparable to nazi germany , and a well thought out `` x worse than hitler '' argument is still not observed in the wild . 
  at least not before the worldcup . 
  then the missile shield has still the small problem that you can not intercept a icbm . 
  basically there are three possibilities , you try to intercept during launch , then you need to get close to the launch site to get your interceptor into the path of the icbm before the icbm is too fast . 
  or mid flight , but the icbm is pretty much the quickest way to launch something into orbit , and you can not align orbits like you would during conventional space operations . 
  or during reentry , but then the reentry vehicle is so fast , that any error of your steering means that you can only reliably hit a reentry vehicle head on , which means that you can basically only intercept strategic weapons that are fired directly at you . 
  additionally this does not even take counter measures into account . 
  or to put it differently , there is a reason that every deployed abm system , the russian [ abm-1 galosh ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abm-1_galosh ) and the american [ lim-49 spartan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lim-49_spartan ) , is nuclear tipped with a warhead in the megaton range . 
  well , the media is not better but at least since the liquid democracy debacle , the pirate party did mainly react to whatever the topic of the day is , instead of trying to push a coherent policy . 
  thing is , there was some hype surrounding the german pirate party in 2010 , and at least since then the party is completely overran by people who confuse twitter with political analysis . 
  the problem is not so much the objectivity of the sources as context . 
  hitler viewed the soviet union as the main enemy ( and consistently stated this from the 1920ies onwards . ), 
  on the other side , stalin viewed a war with germany as largely inevitable . 
  the molotov-ribbentrop pact was just convenient for both sides to gain time for additional preparations . 
  this is the context for these talks , the negotiators assumed that war would break out , but had to keep the appearance of good faith relations . 
  the print magazine was great ten years ago , then they found out that many people like to read a prestigious newspaper if that newspaper avoids multi syllable words and nuance . 
  the proposal is not based on anything technical . 
  your description is largely correct . 
  there is the [ border gateway protocol ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bgp ) , which the routers use to talk to each other . 
  based on this , they decide how to pass a message along ^ 1 , sometimes this mean that a transatlantic route is chosen . 
  but the proposal is horribly stupid , because it messes with a nicely working system while not having any security benefits ( since members of the five eyes or nine eyes would sit inside the `` schengen cloud '' . ), 
  so to be secure , you still have to encrypt your traffic anyhow and then it just does not matter if it is routed through the us or not . 
  ^ 1 essentially each router maintains a table where it notes how to reach certain subnets , and the latency to that subnet via different routes . 
  it usually just uses the fastest route . 
  that was how i understand your post . 
  however , nato is a lot less united today than it was 30 years ago . 
  ( which will change at some point , but this point is probably east germany , not estonia . ), 
  this time no russian tank will roll down the fulda gap either . 
  ( good luck for everybody east of it . ), 
  and it came with a free train ticket . 
  its a map after the great war of ' 14 . 
  the good old madman strategy , straight out of kissinger 's playbook . 
  problem is no one is insane enough to use nukes , so you have to convince the other side that the guy at the switch is that insane . 
   [ ... ] and both countries agreed it was very important to `` appropriately handle '' the issue , [ ... ] that really does not indicate support , as long as china does not specify what ` appropriately ' means . 
  so i would read that as `` do n't fuck up our export markets and we are fine . '', 
  yes , still the thought that it would fall to germany just feels strange . 
  i was talking about your mention of east prussia , which is nowadays a part of poland , 
  i think poland does not really like that proposal . 
  yes , but that was not a problem of the election system . 
  the electoral law was pretty much the only thing that worked in the weimar republic . 
  if you look at [ the elections ] ( http://www.gonschior.de/weimar/deutschland/uebersicht_rtw.html ) , either it was possible to build a coalition ( until 1930 ) , or the kpd and nsdap had more than ten percent each . 
  small correction :  revelations last year about mass u.s. surveillance in germany , in particular of merkel 's mobile phone , shocked germans and sparked the most serious dispute between the transatlantic allies in a decade . 
  this should read :  revelations last year about mass u.s. surveillance in germany shocked germans . 
  the surveillance of merkel 's phone surprised only those that incorrectly believed that international espionage should be reserved for the lower classes . 
  it lead to some posturing between the transatlantic allies . 
  yes , i explicitly said that it is not political censorship - it is just stupid censorship . 
  unfortunately gema is really well entrenched in the german political system . 
  so everybody hates them , but they do n't care . 
  vpn ftw ... 
  `` this video is not available , because it may contain music for which the gema did not issue the respective rights . '', 
  i am so glad that we do not censor political information in germany . 
  may i suggest a penalty shootout ? 
  i strongly doubt that climate change is a main concern of german energy policy . 
  however even then coal has significant advantages . 
  first of all , it is easier to steer a coal power plant than a nuclear one , so the entire base load problems become easier . 
  that is , coal plays a bit nicer with renewable energy . 
  second , it is much easier to refurbish a coal power plant , than a nuclear one . 
  so it is easier to phase out coal , when they are no longer needed . 
  and in the balance , i think that some coal makes sense during the transition to renewable energy production . 
  however , i think the actual reason that we rely on coal so much today is purely domestic politics . 
  merkel did stop the phase out of nuclear power in 2010 , against quite a bit of opposition . 
  when the fukushima disaster occurred in 2011 , she saw that nuclear policy has the potential to overshadow her chancellorship and immediately announced another phase out of nuclear power . 
  and this turn did start a lot of the problems coal power is asked to solve today . 
  because the german nprs are old , and would need replacement . 
  ( one is from the early 80ies and the others from the 70ies . ), 
  actually both the original phase-out plan from 2002 and the current one included extensions for some power stations . 
  you ca n't build a national energy strategy on 1950ties science-fiction stories . 
  the thing about nuclear energy is , it is simply not cost effective . 
  there is a reason , why no private enterprise did ever build a npr , you tie your capital for 30-40 years in a at best marginally profitable enterprise .
