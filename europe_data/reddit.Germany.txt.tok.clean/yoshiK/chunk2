  however , that does not mean , that they do not have a shadow profile of your surfing , for example reddit ( or res ) loads java script from ajax.googleapis.com , and generic blockers can not do anything about it , because they would break arbitrary websites . 
  so you need additionally something that blocks javascript per site , like noscript . 
  which still does not help you for embedded third party content , reddit loads pictures from amazonaws.com , that means that amazon sees you , when you visit reddit . 
  ( similar with facebook , twitter , google when you see a social share buttons on the net , they see you . ), 
  so this is not to say , that these measures do not help . 
  they help a lot . 
  actually i did a [ quick test ] ( http://imgur.com/a/frrnp/noscript ) some time ago , there you see the third party connections from a small test set , and the same test set with noscript and disconnect . 
  but this is just to make live more difficult for generic profile building , it is not a guarantee for actual anonymity . 
  so you should still assume that the internet is a public space , not a private one . 
  at least they can detect each session via the ip adress . 
  and they just need to get a cookie once over the entire session to connect the session to your profile . 
  so any youtube , blogger or other cookie for the google network . 
  ( potentially flash cookie . ), 
  or just a stupid mistake , like logging into gmail . 
  i mean , i do not think that google is evil . 
  but they are really big , and they need just one mistake on your part to add to your profile . 
  if it has not connected you ... that is , if you did not come across some google analytics recently . 
  or a google adwords , or did send a cookie . 
  no , people just knew that jews were sacrificing children , in the same sense that you know that ethnicity has anything to do with being in a gang . 
  because inflation rate , that is the increase of prices , is mostly determined by the development of wages . 
  looking at the map , austerity is misguided ; we need to increase coffee consumption in the pigs . 
  ( and no , cappuccino does not count . ), 
  to start , let me remind you how mind boggling stupid drm is : drm is a system that should forbid reading of some data ( for purposes of copying ) , while symultaniously allowing reading of the same data ( for purposes of consumption ) . 
  the inclusion of drm into html means , that we have lost the w3c . 
  the w3c was always a competent steward of internet standards , but now they proved that they are susceptible to non-technical pressure . 
  and additionally the trusted media extension looks like a very cosy place for any malicious software , it is protected by the browser and has a nice bi-directional channel to communicate with arbitrary web servers . 
  so the problem is not so much technical , the problem is more political , the standardization process is obviously broken . 
  to quote strau\u00df :  vox populi , vox rindvieh . 
   anyway , keynesian economics in a sovereign debt crisis is literally trying to spend your way out of a recession , it 's as stupid as saying to a recovering alcoholic that the cure is more booze . 
  its so stupid that it can obviously debunked by a faulty analogy . 
  if you sit down and calculate , the interesting thing is that deficit spending works better at higher deficit levels . 
  if you have 50 % dept/gdp ratio , you need a multiplier greater 2 for a stimulus to bring the dept/gdp ratio down , since you need to add 2 eur to the gdp for every eur you add to the dept. 
  if you are at 200 % dept/gdp , you just need a multiplier of .5 , since then you just need half the amount of additional gdp to keep the ratio constant . 
  drok the / b / of international relations . 
  only austerity can save us !, 
   ( it 's a central myth of north korean propaganda that the entire globe is rapt with admiration and wonderment at north korea 's every ribbon-cutting ) while in reality the washington post does not report on every opening of a ~ ~ ski lift ~ ~ train station . 
  no , i meant the gastric acid article . 
  but the same information is also in your link . 
  so gastric acid is to a large part simply hydrochloric acid , that stuff is already in your gastric tract in surprisingly concentrated form . 
  therefore adding some of it to food is actually not dangerous , provided that the acid is of a somewhat normal concentration . 
  [ actually hydrochloric acid is pretty harmless . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gastric_acid ) but , you know , scary chemistry words . 
  precisely, 
  you have the causality backwards , germany 's `` success '' is because of stagnant wages . 
  as a german : yes !, 
  we are perfectl2y happy with br\u00fcning , as long as we do n't get inflation ... 
  that does not too bad , i mean what could possibly go wrong ? 
  yes , but `` foreigners destroying german roads without paying !!! 11 ! '', 
  is a much better headline than `` after careful deliberations about the nature of the european union , the current and projected economic interests of germany as well as her neighbors and taking into account the geographic location of germany , we came to the conclusion that the inhibiting of trade alone outweighs any possible gain of the proposed toll system . '', 
  cool . 
  of course it would be better with a water slide , but cool i guess . 
  and this rating house would either not be credible our would report the same as everybody else . 
  the thing is , that ratings are there to reflect the consensus among bankers . 
  not to say that something is worthwhile . 
  we can not allow a fucking gap !, 
  i am not suggesting draconian integration , i am pointing out that your argument fails flat . 
  the problem with the position of adhering to majority culture is , that there is no such thing , so it boils down to adherence to law and learning the language . 
  but the thing with khat is , it is not illegal and it does not impair on the acquisition of the local language . 
  so you have one group of people who do not do anything wrong , but who have no voice , as you say . 
  you have another group of people , who have a voice , but no stake in the question . 
  i think the ethics of this situation is a lot more subtle , than `` shut up and deal with it . '', 
  so you did not listen to american music while in europe ? 
  in 1981 the bundesbank raised the real interest rate from 6.25 % to 10 % , and in 1991 it raised the interest rate from 7.9 % to 9.1 % . 
  and it kept the real interest rate above 8 % during the entire ' 90ies . 
  hardly a investment friendly environment , which eastern germany would have needed .

   socialism , as socialists describe it , require redistribution of wealth , the core tenet of libertarianism is opposition to redistribution of wealth . 
  the core tenet of socialism is the abolishment of classes and states , which may or may not have anything to do with the redistribution of wealth . 
  to quote [ lenin ] ( http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch04.htm#s2 ) on the topic :  it was solely against this kind of `` abolition '' of the state that marx fought in refuting the anarchists !, 
  he did not at all oppose the view that the state would disappear when classes disappeared , or that it would be abolished when classes were abolished . 
  what he did oppose was the proposition that the workers should renounce the use of arms , organized violence , that is , the state , which is to serve to `` crush the resistance of the bourgeoisie '' . 
  incidentally , lenin is the most prominent non-libertarian socialist , and here he precisely discusses the relationship between libertarian socialists ( anarchists ) and vanguardists . 
   and left wingers who think they can legitimately use the term `` libertarian '' are just appropriating and attempting to redefine the term . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/libertarianism ) informs me , that  the use of the word `` libertarian '' to describe a new set of political positions has been tracked to the french cognate , libertaire , which was coined in 1857 by french anarchist joseph d\u00e9jacque who used the term to distinguish his libertarian communist approach from the mutualism advocated by pierre-joseph proudhon . 
  [ ... ] libertarian has been used by some as a synonym for anarchism since the 1890s . 
  [ ... ] and if you look through the article , you will find that the status of private property as a right is historically the most important distinguishing factor between the different libertarian movements . 
  while they all agree on other civil rights , like free speech or limitations of state power . 
  * edit : * sorry , forgot the links . 
  most importantly different central bank . 
  the bundesbank did already proof that they are willing to push germany into recession , rather than tolerate moderate inflation . 
  because socialists are for freedom while libertarians are for oligarchy ? 
  the thing is , that socialism , as socialists understand the word , has nothing to do with the understanding of socialism in right wing libertarian circles . 
  only an oxymoron when you get your political theory from reddit . 
   * it drains wealth from anyone holding that currency or assets linked to that currency and gives it to whoever is expanding the currency . 
  if you have a greek savings account and half of the real value vanishes due to inflation , that 's where it 's gone . 
  that happens only if the total value in the currency area stays constant . 
  but if you consider the case , where a $ 100 bill is printed by fiat and then used to buy a machine that can produce $ 100 worth of goods in the relevant time scale , then all this $ 100 bill does is facilitate the selling of the goods this machine produces . 
  a bit more generally , inflation is determined by supply and demand of money . 
  to look again at the micro picture , again a additional $ 100 bill is printed and spend for some goods and services , say at a bakery . 
  if the economy is depressed , then the guy at the counter is just standing around , waiting for a costumer . 
  and he is happy to accept the additional $ 100 of income . 
  by contrast , if the economy is working at full capacity , then there is a line at the counter , and the bakery has to turn down customers . 
  so they raise prices to extract more money from each individual customer . 
  ( they do not care that they will lose a few customers , they would have to turn them down anyway . ), 
  so returning to the macro picture , additional money in the system will increase the utilization rate of capital in a depressed economy . 
  that is , it increases supply and demand for money and the price level stays constant . 
  by contrast , in a economy working at capacity additional money will only increase the supply but not the demand side , leading to increased prices . 
   * it produces a one-off decrease in wages . 
  if wages are sticky , you will have a period where all your workers are working for less money , which makes them more-competitive . 
   the problem is that for the first point , i suspect that an awful lot of assets have already moved to where they ca n't be converted and devalued .
