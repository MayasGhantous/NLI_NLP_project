   ok lets start . 
  from the beguining ceta is bad for the many same reasons eu is bad . 
  it takes power away from your domocratecly elected representatives ( which as a 15 y. o. you would have the right to elect provided you were fuly enployed in the former yu ) and pots it to a pece of paprer pushed by nonelected representtives in bruxels . 
  and as an aded bonus this pece of paper may be changed without your consent like the lizbon trety for example . 
  how about a yank whos scared to flair up and spends his time spilling shit ? 
  does he fit into the joke ? 
  considering islamist terrorists have killed a total of zero german citizens inside germany ; you are wrong . 
  considering the amount of mental gymnastics they do , i would consider them hardworking !, 
  not all of them are neo-nazis , some are just nutheads ; similar to the [ sovereign citizen movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sovereign_citizen_movement ) in the us . 
  it 's made up , she never said that . 
  she never said that . 
  they claim `` bundes ** er ** gierung.de '' reported that she said it , but the official government website is bundes ** re ** gierung.de and there is absolutely no hint to a statement like that . 
  to summarize your point : `` do wat we say or we wont buy ur cars oh we wont buy ur cars anyways lul '' ; great point you are making !, 
  because of the tariffs ? 
  oh yes , all those british owned , british made alternatives , 
  online polls , youtube and the comment section of the online presence of newspapers are your source ? 
  oh and it 's right here on reddit too , then it must be true !, 
  because commenters of online newspaper outlets are representative ? 
  hey we love our yanks , we really do !, 
  also spiegel is the abiturienten-bild . 
  look at a map , look at the way the cool kids drive , self-explanatory . 
  saw it , mah brotha from anotha motha . 
  you are one wicked smaht boi !, 
  did n't mean to trigger you , bud . 
   we drive on the correct side . 
  what side should your dominant hand be on . 
  wheel or gear stick ? 
  wheel obviously . 
  oh jeez , the rosbifs light years ahead of everyone , jeez , the stupid rest of the world driving on the wrong side of the road jeeeeeeeez . 
  you are a real expert . 
  american english =  british english, 
  thanks for transfering your own freedom to us then , lad !, 
  your sacrifice will be honored . 
  o7 o7 o7, 
   uk  freedom only one of them can apply , sorry lad . 
  `` give us what we want or we will ~ ~ shoot ~ ~ stab ourselves in the foot ! '', 
  realistically they will just sell fewer cars in the uk because some wo n't be able to afford the mark-up ; car sales wo n't just drop to zero . 
  thank you for your input . 
   we in europe should be opening talks and trade with the russian federation . 
  we are , but russia does n't seem to be willing to not annex parts of other countries so ... 
  this time no uk rebate though , 
   if those who were not refugees were removed there would be half as many people , but merkel has not even addressed this . 
  read the title . 
  you mean the wall that was built after hungary had a few thousands ` fugees in their country already whom they got rid of by putting them into buses to austria and trains to germany ? 
  why, 
  yes , everyone else should center their actions around the feelings of a bunch of butthurt brits . 
  you told me you understand the difference between asylum , toleration and immigration , yet you keep talking about migrants . 
  conservatives in germany have different interest as the conservatives in the us ; german parties do n't fit into the us and us parties do n't fit into germany , you ca n't apply the same measurements to both . 
  i highly doubt you have ever read the positions of the cdu and csu . 
  deporting people to the balkans used to be hard , now it is n't ; deporting people to certain mena countries is currently hard , it probably wo n't be in the future . 
   `` hm , 900k seems like it disrupts the population too much . 
  let 's try 800k . 
  better . 
  ok let 's try 700k . 
  ok great . 
  700k per year it is then . '', 
  it 's not about making an upper limit , which does n't solve any problems , it 's about actually finding solutions . 
  locking up the borders does n't solve anything . 
  well , there is a big difference between ten thousand a year and 900 thousand a year ; ignoring small problems and only caring when they become actual problems can be applied to a lot more things . 
   when you 're bringing in millions per year even in 2015 it was less than one million and it 's unrealistic that a number even close to the 860 thousand in 2015 will be reached again . 
   the fact that germany refuses to stop the influx of refugees and migrants it already has lowered it by a lot and germany/italy do n't talk to the northern african countries for fun . 
  i think you vastly underestimate how conservative the cdu/csu and large portions of the german population are . 
   when this shit happened in ukraine recently it was poland and us who wanted to help . 
  you could send them back to greece because of dublin , i do n't think you can just send them back to turkey . 
  mental gymnastics . 
   clinton is the one threatening with nuclear war she is threatening with a military response , which likely means military exercises of the kind already happening and not the destruction of the planet . 
  and why would anyone whos not a completely retarded diplomatic wreck state that they would ** not ** work with a particular candidate ? 
  read his comment and my comment again . 
  considering their top minds have n't managed to kill a single random person with an axe and a bomb yet , i do n't think they are competent enough to kill a specific target . 
   refugees are treated better than some of our own citizens ( unemployed , homeless , addicts ) that 's not true . 
  they are actually treated slightly worse and have a lot less rights . 
   no , it is not . 
  that 's globalism bs . 
  you might wan na get yourself familiar with the public retirement system in germany . 
   shitting all over the country if it 's my country i can do whatever the fuck i want with it , or do i really have to listen to a foreigner to tell me how to do things ? 
   facts about ... genetics are n't real facts anymore . 
  yeah , the sturdy negros and the vile jews . 
   rapes , violence , and eventually attacks pretty rich coming from a yank , do n't you think ? 
   enjoy your new germany i will , thank you . 
  enjoy your current/old ( ? ), 
  america !, 
  we can also avoid any crime by putting everyone in a prison . 
  we could also put mics and cameras in every home so no one dares to ever say something mean !, 
  i do n't think you fully understand the difference between people that are on a deportation list and people that either got asylum or a toleration . 
  the vast majority of those that are on a deportation list will be deported ; it might take a few months , a year or maybe five years . 
   if politicians have n't handled paperless economic migrants by now considering no one cared until a few months ago that would be unexpected anyways . 
  do you understand the difference between immigration and asylum ? 
  more like self interest . 
  yes , the rest of germany consists of extremely rural areas . 
  i highly doubt they would pay , they were also never asked to accept migrants , they were asked to process asylum seekers . 
  they could literally have paid for facilities on their own land , but they did n't , they do n't see themselves responsible , which is why they would n't pay any substantial amount -, 
  i understand that financial problems are a reason , but i still think the `` merkels fault '' angle is played out . 
  so merkel has to pay for it ? 
  well , deporting someone who has papers to a stable country is a lot easier than dealing with someone who does n't have papers . 
  whether the process of actual deportation is effective and fast in reality depends on the state , not on the federal government . 
  well , it 's easy to deport someone who has papers , it 's really hard to deport someone in a constitutional democracy who has legal counsel or someone who does n't have papers . 
  where would the facilities be ? 
  who would pay for them ? 
  yes , as proposed by the v4 : `` flexible solidarity ''  . 
  a great way to further grow yurope closer together and stop relying on germany to solve problems .
