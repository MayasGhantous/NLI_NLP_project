what does a more united europe , or a stronger europe even mean ? 
  a coordinated foreign policy . 
  it would be great if it stops , that one half of europe goes to war and the other half not . 
  ( iraq-war , libya , syria , kosovo ), 
   the next election will indeed be interesting : will voters still be content with the least shitty option or are they willing to crash it all ? 
  i am already super excited . 
  will merkel build a coalition with the spd or with the green party - or will the fdp score enough vote so merkel can go with them . 
  like always my choices are merkel , merkel or merkel . 
  ( which i , oddly enough , like . 
  this election might be the first time i will actually vote for her . ), 
  a topic we talk way too less about . 
  palm oil production is one of the main drivers of deforestation . 
  somehow the dark blue passports freak me out . 
  how can this be an issue people even care about ? 
  i only know it has big problems with hiv infections . 
  back then greece was a kingdom , ruled by the house of oldenburg . 
  they have strong family bounds with england , belgium , the king of italy ( back then ) and the king of spain . 
   in their motion , the two residents said they found the cobblestone too confrontational because it constantly reminded them of the deportation and murder of elte , a 51-year-old accountant who died at a nazi concentration camp in 1945 . 
  arhm , isnt that the exact reason why those plaque exist ? 
  you are mistaken - spain isnt against scotland joining the eu per se . 
  they dont like the idea that a region of an eu country ( remember the scottish vote for independence was before brexit ) can become independent and then join the eu . 
  its because of catalonia . 
  they need the leverage against them by saying `` if you leave spain you cant join the eu . '', 
  since the uk is leaving the eu , spain has no problem with scottland joining the eu anymore . 
  wow ... just ... wow . 
  so why dont happen the same murders in big cities in europe ? 
  oh right - because we do have decent gun regulations here . 
  see , the gun laws of cities like chicago are nice , but if you just need to drive 30 miles to get a gun ... oh and btw : crime clearance rate of murder cases in the usa 64 % germany 97,6 % why ? 
  one of many reasons is , we have a federal gun register . 
  after all the germans still own 30 guns per 100 citizens . 
  ( roughly one per household ) but its a regulated , controlled environment . 
  for example there are 113 weapons per 100 people in bavaria , but only 14 per 100 in berlin . 
  why ? 
  because people living in big cities are that interested in hunting . 
  i have no problem with people owning guns , if they need them .

   nazi germany had an extremely strict gun control regime in the 1930s . 
  before the nazis took over there was an extremly hard regulation on guns . 
  a strong deregulation for `` true '' germans happend in 1938 . 
  only for the jews and gypsys where excluded . 
  changes in 1938 for the `` true '' germans . 
  * the legal age at which guns could be purchased was lowered from 20 to 18 . 
  * the 1938 revisions completely deregulated the acquisition and transfer of rifles and shotguns , and the possession of ammunition . 
  * permits were valid for three years , rather than one year . 
  * more classes of user were exempt from the requirement to hold an acquisition permit ; holders of annual hunting permits , government workers , and nsdap ( the national socialist german workers ' party , aka the nazi party ) members were no longer subject to gun ownership restrictions . 
  they had two targets : denying jews the guns . 
  ( verordnung gegen den waffenbesitz der juden ) and massively arming the `` true '' germans ( ** wehrhaftmachung des deutschen volkes ** ) especially rifles became free for all , while hand could only be optained by trustworthy people . 
  ( party members , government workers ) the stupid `` the nazis took guns ... '' slogan is just false . 
  they did not take guns , they gave everyone guns but the jews . 
  here you can read the law : http://alex.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/alex?apm=0&amp;aid=dra&amp;datum=19380004&amp;seite=00000270&amp;zoom=2, 
  look at the ongoing carnage in the usa . 
  their free for all democratization of violence isnt a world you should aim for . 
  no law in europe will never deny you the opportunity to go hunting or join a sport shooting club . 
  ya thats just bs . 
  for example germany is regulating the arms of its citizens since 1495 ( yes more than 500 years ago ) . 
  the only big movement deregulating arms for german citizens where the nazis ... and we dont have a problem to get a gun ... or 5 or 12 of them . 
  as long as you need it ( shooting as a hobby , hunting , for your job ) you get them . 
  indeed , we should never have started banning nuclear devices and nerve agents for privat citizens . 
   there is , but banning those has always been the next step no , it never was and never will be . 
  because you know - you need them for hunting . 
  and i really dont know what you are talking about germany . 
  https://jakubmarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/number-of-guns-per-capita1.jpg our citizens are well armed . 
  you are allowed to own guns in germany if : * you do hunting ( you need to pass the hunters test , know how to kill an animal correctly etc. ), 
  * shoot for sports in shooting clubs ( you just need to join a local club ) * have a special need of protection ( for example you have a dangerous job like privat detective ), 
  ya , semi auto handguns and books are basically the same thing ... / facepalm, 
  no they arent . 
  you can do what ever you want with your muzzle loader . 
  basically , if the weapon isnt suitable to rob the supermarket around the corner , it isnt effected . 
  because its a remake of the cosmopolitan or `` weltb\u00fcrger '' . 
  terms used be the uber right in the 30s to dicredit jews . 
  ooooops , 
  thats actually a thing . 
  yes , atm there is a technology demonstrator based on a leopard 2 chassis . 
  a block0 version is expected for 2022 and the first batch in 2030 . 
  the new 130mm/l51 gun was shown to public last year . 
  yes , but its an abomination . 
  the leopard 2 can is a leopard 2a4 chassis with a leopard 2a6 turret , the special leopard 2a6m mine protection and the a7 + frontal turret armor ( but not the side ) that happend because you once bought used a4s from the netherlands and instead of upgrading them to standard leopard packages ( a6 or a7 ) you added random stuff you liked . 
  its close , its close . 
  the merkava is also sexy af . 
  well 17 % of the population in `` palestina '' are jews . . but hey , what ever . 
  lets just make stuff up . 
  dont underestimate the importance of israel in german foreign politics . 
  i know its a special case , but still ... 
  dont you guys realize that the term `` globalists '' makes you look really really stupid ? 
  as they are in germany . 
  bristlerider dreams of the infamous german liberal party which existed 30 years ago ( the old german fdp ) until all the social-liberals left the party and only neo-libs remained . 
  he should read that : https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/wende_ ( bundesrepublik_deutschland ), 
  so , you want a generic european left party , but with the modification that they hate muslims . 
  roger . 
  i would pay to read that . 
  because not doing it : * makes you look like an asshole * doesnt help learning from your history * makes your citizens idiotic pseudohistorians * hurts the collective memory of your society * makes your country a laughing stock, 
   europe is a continent with defined borders  considering it anything other than a geographic region europe isnt a real continent , its a fiction , an idea , a region defined by `` europeans '' - generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria . 
  infact its `` westernmost part of eurasia '' the eastern boundary with asia is a historical and cultural construct , as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them . 
  but the genocide begann 1895 when the ottomans murdered 300.000 armenians during the hamidian massacres . 
  you are right that the biggest cleansing wave was 1915 - during that time atat\u00fcrk was fighting the brits in gallipoli ( very famous battle of ww1 ), 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_europe never go full wikipedia before you read it . 
  and btw - armenia is also a member of the concil of europe https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/council_of_europe, 
  learn what free speech is dude ... 
  yes - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_europe, 
  since ... ever .
