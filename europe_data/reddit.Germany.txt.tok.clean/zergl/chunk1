drinking a weissbier as i 'm writing this . 
  flair relevant . 
   in return , i receive a ton of *** free *** points . 
  excuse my while i laugh heartily . 
  there 's an old saying around here , roughly translated : - only death is free and it costs your life . 
  i think the closest saying in english would be `` there 's no such thing as a free lunch '' , but i like ours better . 
  you pay through : a ) increased prices the merchants are charging to cover for the transaction fees b ) by having all your transactions profiled and datamined to hell c ) cross-promotions ( building brand loyalty for partners in the program ) d ) all of the above, 
  actually , drop swabia first . 
  they can rejoin their alemannic bros in whatever state gets made out of baw\u00fc . 
  then just move in the borders of upper and/or lower franconia until the population target is met . 
  as i said when it was first posted on iirc / r/mapporn , a bavaro-austria ( including south tyrol ) would make a lot more sense compared to `` cisalpina '' . 
  the culture and language would be a lot more homogeneous and the population target should be possible to hit if we dropped bits of franconia and/or the palatinate . 
  ois bayer kon i 's no vasteh a wenn 's a weng zaach is . 
  i can still understand it as a bavarian even if it 's a bit tough . 
  i glab do kannt ma a gaudi hom . 
  i 'm not much of a vodka man , but i hear most baltic states and the scandinavians make great potato schnapps . 
  all germany 's fault for halting the delivery of that high tech infantry training simulator thingy . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/si_vis_pacem,_para_bellum or as terry pratchett put it :  `` so many ships , '' [ vetinari ] said . 
  `` in such a short time , too . 
  how very well organized . 
  very well organized . 
  one might almost say ... astonishingly well organized . 
  as they say , ` if you would seek war , prepare for war . ' '', 
   `` i believe , my lord , the saying is ` if you would seek peace , prepare for war , ' '' leonard ventured . 
   vetinari put his head on one side and his lips moved as he repeated the phrase to himself . 
  finally he said , `` no , no . 
  i just do n't see that one at all . '', 
  how can you tell that an austrian family is celebrating halloween ? 
  by the bowl of candy next to the staircase . 
   just a btw , afaik germans consider that guy a `` prostitute '' because money , so mentioning him only weakens your argument . 
  am german , can confirm . 
  sell-out scumbag bastard , that guy . 
  sadly the alternatives were another instalment of kohl and his [ corrupt entourage ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cdu_donations_scandal ) ( it amazes me to this day that wolfgang sch\u00e4uble made a comeback afterwards ) in '98 and our very own polarizing bavarian populist [ edmund stoiber ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edmund_stoiber ) in 2002 . 
   edit : ha ha , seems his nickname is `` gasgerd ''  never heard of `` gasgerd '' , but he was often nicknamed as `` genosse der bosse '' , literally translated `` comrade of the ceos '' , because he was n't that much of an actual social democrat . 
   i do n't give a fuck what the `` un-word of 1999 '' was , but it 's not a trivializing euphemism , it 's disgusting , but it 's not trivializing . 
  it is a euphemism . 
  collateral damage is just a fancy way to say civilian deaths . 
   you got a education , so do n't act stupid . 
  it 's * an education . 
   the fog-of-war happens , insurgents and others specifically hide in civilian populations and buildings to disguise their movements and use the innocent civilians as human shields for a cheap pr victory . 
    the military-industrial complex will always be entwined within the civilian industry and infrastructure . 
  logistical networks , bridges , roadways , railroads , will always be entwined with civilians infrastructure . 
    do n't act stupid or like some douchey self-enlightened ass-hat . 
  go ask the german government or military and they 'll tell you the same god damn thing . 
  you seem to think that i was trying to start an anti-america jerk . 
  i know that you get civilian casualties in any military conflict . 
  it 's unavoidable and the nato intervention was sadly necessary because of the `` ethnic cleansing '' ( coincidentally the un-word in 1992 following the first yugoslaw wars because it 's just a fancy way of saying genocide ) which needed to be stopped . 
  what is n't necessary is using terminology which dehumanizes the civilian victims of armed conflicts . 
  war is a damn dirty business and it should n't be prettied up for press releases with linguistic trickery . 
   collateral damage coincidentally , `` kollateralschaden '' ( direct german translation ) was our [ un-word of the year 1999 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/un-word_of_the_year ) because it 's a disgustingly trivializing euphemism for killing non-combatants . 
  i 've driven across the czech republic to liberec ( cheering for a mate participating at the european pool billiards championship there ) several years back coming in via the phillipsreut/str \u00e1\u017en\u00fd crossing . 
  after the first few kilometers after the border it was a very nice drive on a well built highway system . 
  still really pissed that i did n't have the time to do a stop in prague on my way . 
   p.s. 
  i am almost sure , that they found more . 
  but some of it disapeared david copperfield style . 
  depends . 
  quite likely and very easy if it was stored in [ bullion coins ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bullion_coin ) . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mv3irdl ) ( with standard size bic lighter for scale ) is ~ 1000 euros that you can slip in any pocket around your person before they get counted . 
  if it was stored in larger ( say 1kg ) bars it would be at least somewhat tricky to do without the rest of the raid squad being in on it . 
  geothermal energy . 
  my brother works at a municipal utilities company and they 're currently building ( or recently finished , not sure ) their first geothermal district heating plant . 
  it 's apparently economically viable even if you 're not situated in a geologically active area . 
   who are the people who are following the orders to shoot down protestors ? 
  a morally bankrupt regime with sufficiently indoctrinated and/or intimidated security forces does that to people . 
  hell , back before the fall of the berlin wall there was this little thing : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schie%c3%9fbefehl east german border guards were ordered to shoot people trying to simply escape to the west and did so on a few occasions ( estimates on total casualty count according to the german wikipedia page range between 421 and 1245 victims ) . 
  see also : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stanford_prison_experiment http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milgram_experiment http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_third_wave perfectly ordinary people can be turned into perfectly good monsters given the right circumstances . 
  / r/toosoon you also made me think [ of that old pa comic ] ( http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2007/09/21 ) with your comment and now let 's go to hell together . 
  eh , i do n't mind . 
  just wanted to let you know that you wo n't get a discussion out of me on that topic . 
  you seem to mistake me for someone who actually cares about ( and/or follows ) the case . 
  i only wanted to point out to / u/future3000 that there is a name for what he was describing . 
  reminds me of [ michelangelo ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_last_judgment_%28michelangelo%29#reception_and_expurgation ) :  when the pope 's own master of ceremonies biagio da cesena said of the painting `` it was mostly disgraceful that in so sacred a place there should have been depicted all those nude figures , exposing themselves so shamefully , '' and that it was no work for a papal chapel but rather `` for the public baths and taverns , '' michelangelo worked cesena 's face into the scene as minos , judge of the underworld ( far bottom-right corner of the painting ) with donkey ears ( i.e. 
  indicating foolishness ) , while his nudity is covered by a coiled snake . 
  it is said that when cesena complained to the pope , the pontiff joked that his jurisdiction did not extend to hell , so the portrait would have to remain . 
   focused around the idea that there is no dna evidence linking her to the crime , therefore she is innocent . 
  however just because there is no conclusive dna evidence , it does n't mean to say she is n't guilty http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/csi_effect, 
  hey , we 're even buddies with the french now and [ that was a long grudge match ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french%e2%80%93german_enmity ) . 
  just a little addition about germany 's threshold of 3 % . 
  it was added last fall after the old 5 % threshold was completely sacked by the bverfg ( constitutional court ) , but there 's new legal action against the 3 % threshold already on its way , so while this is currently correct it might still change until election day . 
   somehow it 's always vegetables/foodstuffs that get messed up by dialects . 
  romania is a medium-sized country by european standards and yet there are at least three well identified regions that have different names for many of their vegetables . 
  if you add the republic of moldova ( relationship is similar to germany-austria ) it gets much more complicated . 
  it 's not just the vegetables by a long shot , i just picked those because they were the easiest and most obvious ones for `` foreigners '' to come in contact with . 
  there 's entire dictionaries for bavarian ( got one sitting around the house somewhere ) and i presume the other dialects as well . 
  a `` gloife '' ( do n't even ask me for that one 's etymology ) is a scallywag , a female pig is a `` loas '' , if my parents watch my niece they are `` kindsn '' and my dead grandmother is interred in a `` gott [ e ] sacker '' ( god 's field ) instead of a friedhof . 
  i could go on and on and on . 
   from my time in southern germany i remember being warned not to ask for konfit\u00fcre in the shops . 
  when i was 10 i also brought my cousin in bayern a screaming-yellow team-shirt of borussia dortmund , which is very funny when i think of it now . 
  `` it 's german , so he will love it '' . 
  his friends did n't find it funny . 
  haha , yeah , bit of a faux pas . 
  it could 've been worse if you did that in cologne , though . 
  they are a bit touchy about dortmund there iirc ( do n't try to order an alt in a k\u00f6lsch bar ) . 
   i always thought it was more of an accent , with the words being written mostly the same way ( like british v. american english ) . 
  there 's obviously distinctive accents when speaking standard german , but full dialect is a pretty tough nut for outsiders to follow . 
  there 's grammatical quirks , shifted pronunciation to varying degrees , localized vocabularies \\* , etc. 
  hell , if you 'd sit me as a native speaker down with someone from , say , flensburg and we both went at it in full dialect mode we 'd probably spend most of the time figuring out what the other one actually said . 
  i once tried to talk with a stoned swiss guy at a skiing trip talking [ swiss german ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swiss_german ) and it was a very interesting experience with me asking him to repeat himself slowly every other sentence . 
  :d \\* try ordering a paradeiser ( austrian for tomato , iirc literally `` paradise apple '' ) or erdapfel ( potato , `` ground apple '' analogous to the french `` pomme de terre '' ) in a green grocer 's store in northern germany and tell me how it goes .
