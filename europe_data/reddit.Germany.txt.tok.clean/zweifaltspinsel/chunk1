tbf , merkel was always willing to bend , overstretch or even outright break the rules when it came to the euro crisis . 
  i 'm not even arguing that what she did during the euro crisis was good or bad , but no one can ignore that she did show enough legal creativity to get things done . 
   so i take it your also against infertile people also getting married huh ? 
  not the guy you answered to , but i suppose he meant a married couple that has no children should not get preferential treatment in terms of taxes for example . 
  if i interpret it correctly , he advocates that tax breaks - which today are mostly coupled to being in a marriage - should be solely given to people who have to raise children . 
  as another saying goes : `` der westfale muss halten , was der rheinl\u00e4nder verspricht . '', 
   it could be noted that the study from 2005 only checks data from the years 1997-2001 . 
  well then . 
  this study might be interesting , but the data is nearly two decades old and thus borderline irrelevant to the current discussion , at least in my view . 
  ca n't wait for s03 . 
  of course . 
  the entire brexit debate boils down to the question whether a more centralized or a more decentralized approach is needed . 
  certainly there are areas that require more centralization and some where some decentralization might also improve the situation . 
   but for member countries to defend themselves , some would need larger increases . 
  yes , that 's true . 
  but there have been discussions about integrating the eu forces even more , especially since the uk voted for brexit ( they traditionally were against a common european defense force , arguing that it would compete with nato ) . 
  so , i think a common eu defense is more likely than single states trying to fend for themselves . 
   there is simply no way most eu countries could spend ** an additional 3-4 % of their gdp ** on defense and still keep all their social programs . 
  true , but currently the eu spends about 1.4 % of its gdp on defense , adding another 3-4 % would give you something around 5 % . 
  the eu has a of gdp ( ppp ) $ 19.2 trillion . 
  if it spend 5 % on defense , that would be $ 960 billion annually or 60 % ** more ** than the us . 
  if the eu did that , within a few years , they would easily rival and surpass the us as a military power . 
  why the hell would they want that ? 
  you only require such a bloated defense budget , if you want to create a global empire . 
  it amuses me that the uk seems to be heading to even leave the eea and common market . 
  something even the ukip did not campaign for and apparently no one wanted . 
  just goes to show what a trainwreck this is . 
  tbf , that character tended to have similar chaotic traits as junkrat . 
   it scarred me for a long time i hope you had good [ scar tissue ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imp2mzxom-s#t=58s ) . 
  i guess they have some prepared bills in their drawers . 
  if they publicly implemented such a legal framework , it would mean that they have already decided to kick greece out of the ez . 
  at least that is how the markets would perceive it . 
   whatever you say , grexit advocate :( tbf , grexit was always about the ez and not eu . 
   far more than the marshall plan ever did which - incidentally - was implemented to [ keep countries like greece and turkey within the western bloc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marshall_plan#implementation ) and which was always a european programme . 
  [ western germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marshall_plan#expenditures ) - for instance - received less aid than france or the uk . 
  so please , let 's stop with this myth that the marshall plan was an endeavour solely to rebuild germany . 
  yep . 
  eurobonds would only work if there were a unified european government enforcing structural reforms and impeding spending orgies on the other 's dime . 
  and by that i mean an entity way more strict and demanding than the troika in greece . 
  and we have seen how well the troika was received . 
  even merkel is now against mass immigration ( or at least something akin to what happened in 2015 ) . 
   this ist still merkel vs. schulz , not brandt vs. kiesinger . 
  what is your point here ? 
  merkel is bad at rethoric or somehow connecting emotionally with larger crowds . 
  she won the last two elections , because her adversaries were exceptionally bad at campaigning , not because she is somehow good at it . 
  schulz has more charisma than steinmeier/steinbr \u00fcck / gabriel combined , he is not in the federal government and thus will have more leeway to openly attack merkel 's policies - something neither steinmeier/steinbr \u00fcck / gabriel were or would have been able to do in the same manner . 
  in terms of campaigning , i think schulz is more comparable to schr\u00f6der than any of the other three i mentioned above . 
  and in the election of 2005 , merkel was able to get a comfortable lead ( at ~ 42 % in the polls ) to dwindle to a mere ~ 35-36 % at the elections . 
  and you have to add that merkel does not only face - for the first time in years - a somewhat charismatic spd candidate , but also the right wingers in the union ( -  mostly csu ) and in the form of the afd . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , then a sizable amount of the mainstream parties have started to adopt stricter migration as part of their pogramme . 
  merkel - the poster politician for an open-borders policy - has evolved to a pretty strict migration policy herself . 
  ... wrong !, 
   exacerbated by the fact that germany does not subsidies these poorer regions as a nation-states would do . 
  i 'd say that is not true or that it is an incomplete assessment . 
  the very low interest rates - which keep countries like italy and greece barely afloat - are for the german population a tremendous loss , since they tend to have invested more assets in traditional bonds than other ez countries . 
  this can not simply be neglected . 
   i am extremely worried about what would happen to this country with regards to immigration under an spd/green/linke coalition . 
  i would n't be too worried , since there would at least be some real opposition . 
  imagine the following scenario : what if we had had a red/red/green coalition during the summer 2015 and some spd chancellor would 've acted as merkel did ? 
  probably the cdu and csu would 've opposed these decisions like rabid dogs , they would 've gotten a lot more votes in polls and there would 've been more active opposition of the l\u00e4nder as well . 
  in the end , i bet a left government would 've closed the balkan route or even german borders earlier than merkel did . 
   if this tactic works and le pen and wilders lose maybe they will not win the elections , but i bet that they will not simply disappear and stay silent . 
  if the polls still show a substantial minority supporting populists and being in favour of a strict migration policy , then i can not believe that the governments will simply open the borders again . 
  unfortunately . 
   on / r/europe , not really , it 's pretty balanced . 
  which is why i like / r/europe way more than places like / r/de , where you are a right wing extremist if you are ideologically a bit right from leo trotzki . 
  ( hyperbole of course , but you get my point ), 
  this might be true , but people care more about the refugee policy than about gay marriage . 
  the green party and the csu in one government ? 
  highly unlikely . 
  unless by jamaika you mean greens/fdp/cdu sans csu . 
  which would also be ... interesting . 
   ever time i think that maybe i can vote for them , they do or say something stupid again . 
  that pretty much describes the life of most current or former spd voters . 
   a bit surprised to hear ( in video clip ) that steve bannon actually got in touch with marine le pen . 
  idk , could n't that actually backfire ? 
  if le pen is perceived to be a us-puppet , would n't that rub a lot of patriotic/nationalistic voters the wrong way ? 
   you guys have more in common with them ( uk , us ) than the eu . 
  hey now !, 
  we invited australia to the esc , so there is that . 
  if i were you , i 'd blame ~ ~ polandball ~ ~ the sub that shall not be named for the constant confusion about your flair . 
   if you want to retaliate on a 30 % german car tax , you would probably try to invent a 30 % us internet company tax for google/facebook/etc . 
  you could just start by enforcing that they ought to pay taxes at all on their revenue they make here . 
  these tax-evading loopholes are really costing us billions . 
  adding to what / u/crustedlamb said , the transatlantic relationship is not only about economy and trade . 
  i would even go so far that geopolitical strategies , shared values ( human rights etc. ), 
  and the military ties in the form of nato are even more important than trade . 
  hence , nato has integrated western militaries for decades now , while we have just recently started to try to get an fda running in the form of ttip . 
   the current vibe definitely is n't to appease trump . 
  it 's kind of interesting for a formerly very pro-us country . 
  this starts to feel a lot like 2002-2003 , when gw bush and his coalition were planning their invasion of iraq . 
  granted , germany 's ( and france/russia 's ) opposition to the invasion were mostly fought diplomatically and a trade war was not something likely to happen . 
   frauenf\u00f6rderung in nrw only refers to promotions in the public sector well , i said :  practiced at least in positions offered by the state so apparently there is no argument here . 
   liar . 
  the rule you are refering to in nrw did n't exist 3.5 years ago and does n't conform to the constitution anyway . 
  well , at least when i applied 4 years for a position in nrw , it was in effect . 
  maybe it was n't a law yet , but already practiced at least in positions offered by the state . 
  so , please stop being an ass . 
   nobody gained anything from this , besides the populists , i suppose . 
  and the criminal people traffickers , of course .
