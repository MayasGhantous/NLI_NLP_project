  we are going to split the us in 28 occupation zones , so around 2 states for everybody / s, 
  i do n't think he is going to be assassinated . 
  america seems to have the tradition to only assassinate the good presidents . 
  so trump is totally off the hook here, 
  or until he dies and his son becomes the next king, 
  that is exactly the point . 
  if someone in the ranks under merkel would think , that her adminitration is controlled by a foreign power - which is basicly the key message of that cia guys letter - it would be his right ( or even duty ) under the stated gg-article to resist and speak out . 
  and in the end it would be the task of independent courts of the country to decide if this was either right or treason . 
  take a look in the [ grundgesetz , art. 20 , abs .4 ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gg/art_20.html ) , this will shock you then . 
  german press is reporting , that president klaus johannis is backing the protests and that the justice regulatory authority csm filed a complaint against the ordnance . 
  this is more about the difference between the cdu 's and the spd 's point of view to european politics , than about the difference of both candidates . 
  a cdu-let administration would continue with uncompromising austerity and a very germany-centric approach towards the eu . 
  the spd seems to have a more inclusive approach . 
   ~ ~ russia ~ ~ usa is lead by a group of extremely powerful individuals who are clearly opposed to western democratic societies . 
  they do have a lot of money . 
  they have nuclear weapons . 
  they have a big nation with a lot of willing people supporting them . 
  interestingly this may also fit nowadays, 
  [ `` the european commission uses english , french as german as its working languages '' ] ( http://europarlamentti.info/en/european-parliament/working-languages/ ) but that 's only about the commission , not about `` the eu '' , to be fair, 
  gerhard schr\u00f6der turned them into a party , which is way to neoliberal to be social democratic anymore and they do n't seem to be willing to change that course again . 
  and seeeeeeeeee !, 
  that 's true . 
  but the former is just stupid and dangerous for yourself , whereas the latter is stupid and dangerous for everybody . 
  as father , as son . 
  i prefer people who believe in homeopathy over people who deny climate change nonetheless, 
  yes , i also read that survey and do not think that it is untrue . 
  but the ones unwilling to fight for their country are the ones who do n't join the armed forces in the first place . 
  it would be utterly stupid to embark upon a career as soldier when you are unwilling to fight for your country . 
  if there would be a real nato case of alliance according to art . 
  5 of the nato treaty it would n't be the everyday soldier who decides if he is going to fight or not anyway , but the political leaders . 
  and i do n't think that any nato country could even afford to discuss if to take part or not , without loosing every international credibility their country has . 
  so i am quite sure , that if any nato member ( regardless of their geographic location ) would be attacked by another country , every other nato member state will participate in its defence . 
  well any other member than the trump led usa at least . 
  because he would look into that countries history of financial support first and then decide if he likes to take part in the defence or not . 
  oh , i absolutely do think they would . 
  what made you come to that conclusion ? 
  1 ) yes , nato is very important as a ** defensive ** alliance , every member benefits from the fact that you would be backed by the other members , if you were attacked . 
  this includes the us military just like the other members militaries . 
  but note that the bases , the us still has in europe , are not vital for europes defense ( they have been during the cold war though ) , they are mainly still here , because you use them as hubs for your military operations in the middle east and northern africa . 
  2 ) yes , that probably would be the us , but only because you have by far the largest armed forces . 
  but nobody ever asked you to have them . 
  i do not think that there will be a major conflict were nato has to defend one of its members anytime soon , because the alliances size is kind of an insurance here . 
  i do oppose aggressive nato wars . 
  if a member thinks it has to attack or invade a ( non-nato ) country it should gather allies on a bilateral basis . 
  3 ) as others have stated : if you want to spend less , feel free to do so . 
  nobody ever asked you to build the biggest armed forces . 
  4 ) trumps threat , that he considers not defending member states in the case they would be attacked undermines the whole idea of nato , because it kills the detterence effect . 
  if he is unsatisfied with the amounts other members are investing , he is of course free to criticize it , but not publicly . 
  this should have been done internally . 
  but maybe you can not expect that a states leader thinks this through , when he is to such an extent unfit for office as trump is . 
  that 's a damn good video !, 
  and he is going to threat to release the `` refugee hordes '' , as allways . 
  oh , opposing austerity does not mean opposing reforms . 
  clearly greece did fail to adjust their social systems to modern times . 
  but you can save an economy and a society to death . 
  people need two things ( at least ) . 
  they need a job and they need an outlook . 
  if they do not think , that their future living standard will at least be quite okay , they tend to vote some extremist who promises them what they want . 
  we had failing austerity policy in germany at the end of the 1920s , beginning of the 1930s . 
  and you know where that let to . 
  since sch\u00e4uble turns 75 this autumn , i really , really , really hope he is going to retire anyway . 
  but sch\u00e4uble being the pain in the ass he is , he probably wo n't . 
   part of the reason why austerity is the go-to solution is because it compartmentalizes responsibility , it 's technically easy to implement and has very few institutional barriers . 
  . . and kills social systems , therefore creates right - and leftwing populism . 
  so what could possibly go wrong ? 
   i helped bring down the soviet union oh , he should be getting along with trump very good . 
  they seem to have the same level of modesty : none !, 
   this is also what his chief ideologist , steve bannon wants . 
  seems that bannons [ agenda ] ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/22/steve-bannon-trump-s-top-guy-told-me-he-was-a-leninist.html ) does not only apply for his own country, 
   look past trump eventhough this might be reasonable , it 's unlikely to happen before you ( people of the us ) wo n't do one thing first : get past trump !, 
  seriously , you are the only ones that can stop the downward spiral of both your civil rights and foreign relationships . 
  and if you have to start a revolution for it , do that !, 
  he probably meant post-brexit, 
  sorry , got lost in translation here . 
   it was the taco thing that sealed the deal , to be quite frank . 
  shush , not so fast !, 
  maybe they add some bottles of mezcal , if we bargain a little, 
   by washing ** quickly ** is this even possible for a swiss ? 
  yes , her reasoning here is very poor . 
   that was miles better than hillary vs. trump . 
  what combination would n't have been ? 
  * sigh *, 
   merkel has made older and more powerful politicians , almost all of them men , pay a high price for underestimating her . 
  yes , she was very successful in sawing off every competitor one by one within the cdu during the schr\u00f6der administration , leaving her as the only viable chancellor candidate of her party for the 2005 elections, 
  for european protestants - as merkel is - divorcing and remarrying somehow is not that big of a deal . 
  a thing which is quite special in german politics ( from a us/uk point of view ) , is that all big topics are bargained about in detail at the coalition negotiations at the beginning of the term . 
  that often takes weeks . 
  so 2013 cdu , csu and spd agreed on a quite binding coaltition paper , which determined the politics of all predictable areas until 2017 . 
  you have to imagine that negotiations like a bazaar . 
  the spd for example got their minimum wage ( which was the main promise they made to their voters while campaigning ) , but therefore had to give up positions in other areas . 
  the coalitions position on same sex marriage was obviously a topic , where the conservative csu had its turn . 
   her progressive stance with the whole migrant crisis thing has definitely reinforced the view that she is left leaning . 
  as has her response to trump 's presidency . 
  the former had imho more to do with her being a pastors daughter and believing in christian values than being left . 
  the latter is plainly based on sanity and reason . 
  she is left within the boundaries of her conservative party , what would be centrist on the overall political scale . 
  yeah , and it is just one party away from not being democratic at all . 
   ... stopping and returning any migration vessels ...  ... using financial pressure ( such as withholding development funds ) ... 
  so kind of like building a wall and make them pay for it ? 
  funny thing is , that austerity utterly failed in the 1920s/30s .
