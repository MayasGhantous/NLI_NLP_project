  politicans and economic scientists of the west remembered that in the 50s-70s and drew the right conclusions out of it . 
  and then - out of the blue - somehow they forgot . 
   a vision where all decisions at an european level must exclusively benefit germany . 
  no , it 's not about exclusively benefiting . 
  but the german approach to european politcs can be very know-it-all-ish from time to time . 
  so it 's more about thinking , that our interpretation of how to play by the rules should be followed . 
  the reason behind this is the believe of german tax payers , that they work hardest in europe , so they probably know best . 
  this view is highly fired by the conservative part of german mass media . 
  of course it 's utterly bullshit and arrogant , but it 's a typical german flaw . 
   now lets see if they are willing to swallow the bitter pill of a tighter integration of the euro-area countries ( including ireland , portugal , greece , cyprus ) with a fiscal union , united bond emission because we sure as hell wo n't accept more loss of sovereignity nor contributing to a joint military without a less hostile position from germany and other central european countries . 
  hopefully our finance minister sch\u00e4uble will retire after the election this autumn , he is going to be 75 then . 
  in my opinion he is the main force behind the southern european-hostile german fiscal policy and the oposition to united bonds, 
  reverse vampirism ? 
  because the greens were a leftish party back in the 80s and since the csu is mentally living in the past , they still do n't like them . 
   weird , the alt righters have been telling me frauke petry is 100 % certain to be chancellor that opinion is what you get , when facebook is your only/main source of information, 
   have the greens and the spd said they 're up for a coalition with die linke ? 
  let 's put it that way : it is not as big a taboo as it was at the last few elections, 
  other than ...  that 's how it is and always has been . 
  ... you did n't really give a reason what your problem is with calling it marriage , did you ? 
   some people just can not stand when things in other countries do n't proceed in a way they wish to . 
  to the extent of attempting to `` fix '' or `` discipline '' these countries you 're talking about the military campaigns the us executed in the last decades ? 
  ~ ~ people in eu think ~ ~ us president is a laughingstock ftfy, 
  you are giving him too much credit in ~ ~ geopolitical strategic ~ ~ thinking . 
   crazy wasg communists well , the most of the wasg people were the former left wing of the spd . 
  i did n't know that that was considered communistic by someone . 
   also known as the dark years of german socialism there was german socialism ( after 1990 ) ? 
   of course you had to omit this part i did n't want to post a whole wikipedia-paragraph here . 
  that 's why i took the first sentence and linked to the source , so that interested people like you could read it over there . 
  you reap what you sow, 
  [ `` the fraktur typefaces were in heavy use in nazi germany , when they were initially represented as true german script '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fraktur#use ), 
   tell us to die , we will die oh look , lemmings !, 
  well , at least they also printed on top who to blame ( may ), 
  we concentrated on europe, 
   poland should be something anyone can label if it only would stop moving around all the time, 
  oh , that 's why the germans are so good at biathlon ? 
  so , will you scots move there with your mother or stay here with your father ? 
  but it was a promising attempt of yours, 
  the sultan said so and i 'm afraid he is the only official source which matters at all . 
  if it was for me , we could swap turks . 
  send the ones who voted for the dictatorship to turkey . 
  they should be pleased , since they like the system there so much . 
  the available places here could be filled up with turks who do n't want to live under the erdogan regime anymore . 
  goodbye turkey , it was nice knowing you . 
  give us a call when the dark times are over , will you ? 
   basically taught them how to live you taught us shit  vietnamese have an 80 % positive opinion of america but to germans , we 're the devil . 
  have a look at [ the history of that survey ] ( http://www.infratest-dimap.de/typo3temp/_processed_/csm_folie25_03_cd42747570.png ) . 
  the numbers used to be high , until you got yourself a moron as president , who is constantly threatening the eu . 
   i 've long stopped caring what germans think about anything . 
  yeah , i see . 
  that 's why you 're whining around here , because you do n't care at all ? 
  very convincing !, 
   would be curious to see the same poll during obama 's presidency . 
  [ here you are ] ( http://www.infratest-dimap.de/typo3temp/_processed_/csm_folie25_03_cd42747570.png ) . 
  the us is the dark blue line . 
  well , might it be that france and germany may have more in common than france and the usa ? 
   i would n't move to europe will you promise ? 
  that survey is not about how the people of other countries are viewed but about their governments being trustworthy . 
   everyone knows that these low numbers have nothing to do with whooping ass but they do have to do with an ass !, 
  then it wo n't matter anymore !, 
  no that has nothing to do with the war . 
  [ it 's a very recent trend ] ( http://www.infratest-dimap.de/typo3temp/_processed_/csm_folie25_03_cd42747570.png ) . 
  i asume the numbers would still be high with another us president . 
   future is sealed i 'm afraid you do n't understand the concept of future . 
   what about the fact that almost all of nato 's funds come from the u.s. ? 
  well [ 22 % of direct funding and 72 % of indirect funding ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_67655.htm ) is a lot , i give you that . 
  but it definetly is not `` almost all of nato 's funds '', 
   and this is why trump wants germany to pay its fair share to the un well , it pays the [ fourth biggest share ] ( https://factly.in/united-nations-budget-contributions-by-member-countries/ ) of all countries , being the [ fourth biggest economy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( nominal \\ ) ) . 
  so what 's unfair about it ? 
   but you can trust us or not ? 
  at least we definetly do trust you not trusting us !, 
  well , yes ... 
  but i wonder who would be viewed worse if you 'd ask about individuals : trump or erdogan ? 
  that would be a very interesting head-to-head race . 
   ... i forgot the rest . 
  and thanks for all the fish, 
  oh do n't feel sad !, 
  i bet the isis-caliphate would be worse , if they would ask about it too . 
  ok , that makes sense . 
  thanks !, 
  but adding a new state would create a lot of jobs in the flag making business , 
  why did n't they just campaign to vote `` no '' , but called for boycott instead ? 
  well , yes !, 
  those guys see themselves as the resistance ( like the one against hitler ) and our government as a suppressing regime ( like the nazis ) . 
  the political wings are switched here , but the scenario is the same for them . 
  nobody ever said that this guys are sane . 
  that 's an old [ alternative suggestion ] ( http://en.wikimannia.org/wirmer_flag ) for the german flag which pegida `` hijacked '', 
   are they even still around ? 
  wow !, 
  and now complain again about germans only putting sauce on schnitzel , 
  rules haffe to pe folloved !, 
  probably [ tatort ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tatort ) and [ lindenstra\u00dfe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lindenstra\u00dfe ), 
  well , take a look at [ schmelzk\u00e4se ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=schmelzk\u00e4se&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=vct&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewio2pkv95vtahwkk5okhzukdgsq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=971#imgrc=_ ) . 
  i do n't see a tube there . 
  and [ here is an article ] ( http://uebermedien.de/11488/kartenlegen-mit-kriminellen-auslaendern/ ) ( in german ) showing all the methodological flaws of this map, 
  which says more about british alcohol prices , than about prices for air tickets , to be fair . 
   we basically invented `` trump-like movements '' you are definetly an early adopter , but i think the first trump-like-movement was [ milosevic 's in serbia ] ( https://theintercept.com/2017/02/07/what-slobodan-milosevic-taught-me-about-donald-trump/ ) . 
   adjective declinaison `` i 'd rather decline two drinks than one german adjective '' - mark twain, 
  i 'd say that there is mainly an european common understanding that environmental protection etc. 
  is important and the right thing to do . 
  the level of commitment however varies across and also within countries .
