  they reality is that many greeks would sell their souls to the devil ( or vote for syriza ) , in order to prevent new democracy or pasok to regain power . 
  yes sort off . 
  i 'll quote this from / r/askhistorians . 
   unlike socialists and communists , fascists wanted to cure modern society 's alienation through the creation of a hierarchal state made up of different social classes working together for the benefit of the nation . 
  this is called ` corporatism ' and is fascism 's only real contribution to economic thought . 
  the competing segments of industrial society would be united by the leader act entirely through the state , which incidentally would preserve existing capitalist hierarchies and strengthen them . 
  fascists were for a sort of inverted social-democracy which would give social services to its members but not to anyone else . 
  if you were not a member of the nation or the volksgemeinschaft - tough luck . 
  this is why many people participated in fascist and nazi organizations like the dap or hitler youth ; if you did not actively participate in the national or racial community , you were not a part of it and would be socially ostracized ( or worse ) and denied state benefits . 
  they did n't necessarily believe in fascist ideology , and many opposed it , but the fascist state required them to participate in it . 
  the major difference between fascism and socialism is that the former was all about preserving hierarchy and bourgeois society , while getting rid of industrial alienation through the creation of a totalitarian society . 
  the concept of hierarchy is paramount in fascism . 
  how so ? 
  assad has razed his own cities and has killed more civilians than isis . 
  assad is as bad as isis / unpopular opinion, 
  all empires have . 
  woosh, 
  who is the football player ? 
  if you go to an island as a tourist you will be treated like a god . 
  if you go to komotini . . not so much . 
  no i 've been following this story . 
  she was captured on august 10 and the body appeared on august 18 . 
  but by all means , believe the dailymail/h \u00fcrriyet version . 
  does your primitive brain detect the irony in your comment ? 
  you want to see kurds die and get satisfaction from it . 
  many people in greece want to see immigrants drown as well . 
  you and them are the same . 
  you ca n't pick and choose when to be a humanist . 
  it is obvious that she wasnt killed in a fight . 
  she was captured , tortured , raped and her body mutilated and dumped in a kurdish neighborhood for initmidation . 
  you comment expressed content at this fact . 
  probably the fact that he justifies the rape and mutilation of a prisoner . 
  you remind me of greek election propaganda polls , where the sum was higher than 100 % . 
  kos lesvos and leros . 
  every single moment after alexander 's death . 
  all culminating to the current ultra embarrassing fact that we are on a fast track to become the first country that will drop from developed to developing status . 
  actually ekathimerinh is lying . 
  what he said was `` we dont want to stay in greece , we want to go to europe . '', 
  the one given my mussolini in his book `` the fascist doctrine '' . 
  that might have been true before but the recent wave of syrians consists of whole families who even used to be middle class back in syria . 
  you can clearly see the difference because of their clothes , their shoes etc. 
  whole families are arriving in greece . 
  almost exclusively from syria . 
  what 's wrong with you ? 
  what 's the point of providing counter-arguments when i know that you will completely ignore them ? 
  even now that we face a crisis of dystopian proportions there are still people who justify america 's actions in the middle east ... 
  the 14 greek airports served around 19 million passengers in 2013 , and will generate revenues of more than 180 million euros a year , according to fraport . 
  after taking losses in the first three years , fraport stands to make healthy profits from the deal for the remainder of the concession . 
  source : cnn, 
  excuse me , but is n't fraport public owned and controlled by the german state of hesse and the frankfurt city utility ? 
  the financial problems of my country are completely irrelevant to the topic . 
  if any person is stranded in greek waters the coast guard is required by law to save him and take him to save haven . 
  this is international law and that is why smugglers sink their ships . 
  the distance between kos and turkey is just 3 kilometers and this happened a few meters away from turkish coast in turkish waters . . 
  because this video does not prove anything . 
  also , smugglers have been noticed to deliberately sink their ships when confronted by coast guard because it is obligatory for the coast guard to save the refugees when that happens . 
  they are from the middle east , not africa . 
  yeah who backed the mujahideen ? 
  who backed the enemies of assad ? 
  you leave because the tourist season lasts 5 months and there is not much to do employment-wise for the rest of the year . 
  can you even see the irony in your comment ? 
  do you think that people who walk kilometers on all fours to humble themselves before god , are big fans of tolerance ? 
  you are confusing the terms refugees and immigrants . 
  does mr scheuble know that the greek church does not give receipts for the candles ? 
  [ eu member greece ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cmcut7kwuaq-mjg.jpg ), 
  what did your grandfather do during ww2 ? 
  cool story, 
  http://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1434621/mediterranean-migrants.jpg https://pbs.twimg.com/media/clvm0cpweaavjkc.jpg, 
  seems pretty standard to me . 
  well you were wrong, 
  i would like to see a source for this . 
  if centre-right is not considered economically liberal then i do n't know what is . 
   immigrant who is against multiculturalism https://khlyst.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/paris_tuileries_garden_facepalm_statue.jpg, 
  greece has 200 % debt to gdp and a gdp that is shrinking by 5 % each year since 2009 . 
  you are not completely wrong . 
  your mistake is that the money were spent on the olympic games , on contracts with siemens , hochtief , fraport etc and on the bribes that were distrubuted between the corrupt officials in order to sign said contracts . 
  the mythological welfare state that you bild readers fantasize about does not really exist . 
   muh flat screen http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2015/06/greek%20bailout%20uses%202_0.jpg http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-06-23/unspoken-tragedy-upcoming-third-greek-bailout http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/29/where-did-the-greek-bailout-money-go, 
  so you are fine with bailing out the greek banks with 211 billion euros from 2008 to 2013 , but you get mad with tsipras for the 22 million esm bailout of 2015 ? 
  greeks were not withdrawing money in 2008 and as an american you should be more familiar with the housing bubble and with the banks ' loan policies that started this whole mess . 
  you did not answer my question . 
  in which particular tv station or radio station has he given an interview or speech in the last 6 months apart from chatzinikolaou 's enikos 3 months ago . 
  here we go * 2008 : under pm karamanlis 28 billion euros were given to the banks ( n3723/2008 ) * 2010-2011 : n3845/2011 = 15 billion euros to the banks . 
  n3864 = 25 billion euros to the banks . 
  \u039d3864 = 10 billion euros to the banks . 
  \u039d3965 = 30 billion euros to the banks . 
  \u03a6\u0395\u039a 203/2011 = 15 billion euros to the banks . 
  * 2012 under pm papadimos \u039d4031 = 30 billion to the banks * 2013 under pm samaras 25 more billion euros to the banks . 
  so if we also take in consideration the efsf fund we have given 211 billion euros in 6 years in order to recapitalize the greek banks . 
  these money are mine , yours and every ez taxpayers ' that have gone down the drain . 
  and what do we have to show for it ? 
  nothing !, 
  according to the latest review the 4 big systemic greek banks will have to consolidate into 2 . 
  really ? 
  in which radio or tv station have you watched him in the last 6 months ? 
  because i have seen him only once . 
  til christine lagarde is a neo-marxist . 
  you are confused . 
  the imf 's report indicates that the 3rd bailout will fail even if the reforms are fully implemented . 
   so , i guess nd is also responsible for the 25 billion that will be needed to restructure the greek banks .
