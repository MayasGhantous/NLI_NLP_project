  here we go * 2008 : under pm karamanlis 28 billion euros were given to the banks ( n3723/2008 ) * 2010-2011 : n3845/2011 = 15 billion euros to the banks . 
  n3864 = 25 billion euros to the banks . 
  \u039d3864 = 10 billion euros to the banks . 
  \u039d3965 = 30 billion euros to the banks . 
  \u03a6\u0395\u039a 203/2011 = 15 billion euros to the banks . 
  * 2012 under pm papadimos \u039d4031 = 30 billion to the banks * 2013 under pm samaras 25 more billion euros to the banks . 
  so if we also take in consideration the efsf fund we have given 211 billion euros in 6 years in order to recapitalize the greek banks . 
  these money are mine , yours and every ez taxpayers ' that have gone down the drain . 
  and what do we have to show for it ? 
  nothing !, 
  according to the latest review the 4 big systemic greek banks will have to consolidate into 2 . 
  those damn kentucky coal miners, 
  let 's just say that many albanian immigrants that came here in the 90 's are returning to their homeland . 
   going pretty great so far i chuckled, 
  scheuble i used to hate you , but it seems that you are our last hope . 
  german taxpayers ' money have been spent to recapitalize greek banks . 
  220 billion euros from the bailouts have gone to the greek banks with more to come with the third bailout . 
  it 's not the debt that has increased , it is the gdp that has decreased . 
  50 billion euros in capital flight from the banks , layoffs , businesses closing increasing tax evasion etc. 
  it 's just a forecast for 2015 though , so we 'll see where we 're at in a few months . 
  knock yourself out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_government-debt_crisis_countermeasures very little has been done about tax collecting though , i 'll give you that . 
  varoufakis had an idea about cutting funds from military spending and using them to create an indpendent agency like usa 's irs , but that 's gone now . 
  the 200 % estimate is just for syriza 's fuckups during the last 6 months . 
  it does n't take in consideration the new bailout . 
  the 300 % is my own estimate since the bailout is going to be around 95 billion euros . 
  get on with the times . 
  if this memorandum is finalized , greece 's debt to gdp will be approximately 300 % . 
  heh this deal is greece 's tombstone . 
  did they translate the part when he said that syriza members dont wake up in the morning ? 
  the london agreement . 
  according to them they were acceptable losses in hitler 's campaign of saving the world from communism . 
  [ then ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cj_cemzukaas0vx.jpg ) and [ now ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cj_canyusaaxvis.png ), 
  iirc there is some kind of embargo between the media and the gd but i do n't remember who initiated it . 
  by whom ? 
  depends on which island . 
  2013 : http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/23/greece-primary-idusb5n0n100b20140423 2014 : http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/04/us-greece-budget-iduskcn0ht0oj20141004  `` based on current data , the primary surplus ( of 2014 ) is estimated at around 2 percent of gdp , considerably higher than the target , '', 
  whether the reforms of the last 5 years are real or not is not a matter of opinion that we can agree or disagree on . 
  domestic surplus even of 0.01 % means that you can pay your pensions, 
  why do i need to present anything ? 
  everyone who has followed this knows that greece had a surplus in the end of 2013 ( without the interest payments of course ) and also everyone knows that we have n't received any kind of aid from troika since august . 
  at august we failed the review and more measures would be issued by troika ( hardouvelis email ) . 
  that was what caused the snap elections at january 2015, 
  your first two points are wrong . 
  greece is running on a surplus for 2013 and 2014 and has been paying wages and pensions even without funding from troika since last august . 
  edit : i wish those who downvote me would present some facts that dispute what i am saying .

  oh i do n't care about / u/vilefrog . 
  i have corrected him numerous times in this subreddit about the `` no reforms '' claim . 
  he is either a legit racist , a troll or a shill . 
  i just keep posting articles to inform the possibly uninformed redditor who might happen to read the conversation . 
  no reforms in the past 5 years ? 
  really ?

  itt : redditors who do n't understand that 90 % of these tweets are trolls . 
  what is this welfare state you speak of ? 
  i did my service in 2011-12 when golden dawn was at its peak and among the lower ranks gd was very popular . 
  i have no idea how it is among the higher ranks though . 
  `` hey , do you want to be in ez or not ? '', 
  that was the question . 
  he is a murican who thinks fascism is left wing . 
  if tsipras was smart he would have already started changing the army leaders with more moderate ones . 
  that was aready done in 2012 with the psi . 
  german and french banks were exposed to the toxic greek bonds . 
  now their exposure is close to 0 % . 
  slovakian finmin `` the spring crusher '' proving varoufakis right . 
  slovakian finmin just admitted that this whole shitshow is punishment for greece . 
  are you merkel ? 
  yes neoliberalism is incompatible with democracy , that much is clear . 
  so germany and finland are our last hopes . 
  little did i know that updating your economy to the 21st century meant selling public property worth 25 % of your gdp . 
  the previous deal was about concluding the second bailout program . 
  this deal is about a new 3rd bailout . 
  we will probably end up having a civil war just like ukraine . 
  because it has become clear that neoliberal policies are the solution to the crisis . 
  yes as it did solve the problem back in 2012 with ex goldman sachs banker papadimos . 
  there is nothing complex about the situation . 
  scheuble asked for tsipras to resign and a government of technocrats to take over greece . 
  it is a coup because scheuble asked for tsipras to resign and a government of bankers/technocrats to take over greece . 
  for the millionth time ( not that you care about facts ) . 
  the two previous bailouts were used to recapitalize banks , remove exposure of eu banks to greek toxic bonds and pay back previous debts . 
  not a single penny was used for the things you say . 
  common sense ? 
  every time greece accepts , something new is added to the measures . 
  greek journos reported that it was said during the eurogroup . 
  i just heard it on mega tv from their correspondant . 
  i hope they misheard or something . 
  scheuble just said that he does not consider greece a european nation . 
  how do you call this ? 
  you could n't be more wrong about the greek media . 
  demetrios is an ancient greek name and not a christian name, 
  it 's also a bit isis, 
  wtf ? 
  explain to me in what universe tsipras is a dictator, 
  having the referendum earlier would give the opposition and the media they control more time to terrorize the people against a no vote . 
  the day the referendum was called initial polls had the no at 80 % and with one week the media managed to drop it at 60 % . 
  also having more weeks of capital controls instead of one would contribute to a yes vote . 
  if the referendum was done just now , when the possibility of a grexit was so high , many people including me would be too scared to vote no . 
  it appears as a farce to non-greeks . 
  but the no vote was in reality a no to the trifecta : previous governments , oligarchs , media networks . 
  and it gave tsipras , who was on the verge of collapse , the mandate to go forward .
