  the problem is that because of high unemployment and not secured `` black '' employment very few people of my generation will be able to fit the criteria to get a pension at 67 . 
  well , it 's just the first day . 
  tomorrow there will be a pro-yes demonstration in athens . 
  there will definately be incidents . 
  what a load of bullshit . 
  syriza started by claiming that they will reverse every austerity measure and instead , after 5 months they ended up miserably proposing recessive measures worth 8 billion euros . 
  and the debtors still would not give in . 
  also , all previous pms have met with putin [ 1 ] ( http://kourdistoportocali.com/storage/photos/master/201408/putin7216.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://s.enet.gr/resources/2010-07/1477814-thumb-large.jpg ) , [ 3 ] ( https://left.gr/sites/left.gr/files/styles/large/public/samaras-poutin.jpg?itok=o6gmnen5 ) . 
  it 's no big deal , the media just used it for antisyriza rhetoric . 
  that 's because the gdp has shrunk by 30 % since 2009 . 
  i agree with everything you said since i have no sympathy for both the far right and religious fundamentalism of any kind . 
  i was just stating that the probability of being a victim of a terrorist attack is very low . 
  the far right gaining momentum is something that affects our lives much more than acts of terrorism . 
  we / r/worldnews now, 
  because she is trolling . 
  the two previous imf programs had tax increases and now that tsipras proposed more taxes she said that they will lead to recession . 
  perhaps we should indeed drown the people who ca n't understand the sarcasm of this caricature . 
  [ how i see christine lagarde right now ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ciienieuyaazunx.jpg ), 
  it 's not a matter of competence , it 's just groups of people representing different interests . 
  continue the program without austerity measures . 
  since the debtors wont allow that , then default and grexit . 
  hm , eurogroup started at 14:30 and varoufakis arrived at 14:15 . 
  i was watching live . 
  ehm , that 's not true . 
  [ help ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cigilsyxaae86wp.jpg ), 
  inb4 juncker announcement : `` my friend alexis tsipras did not bring me any proposals . '', 
  austerity measures equal more liberal work laws that favor investors and businessmen . 
  also , there are people who want cuts in government spending like pensions and are generally in favor of smaller government . 
  this is a deleted tweet from the politician in the picture concerning anti-austerity demonstrations that happened couple of years ago . 
  http://info-war.gr/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/erdogan-620x200.jpg i translate : `` maybe we should become erdogan . 
  did you see how he cleared the square ? 
  we should do the same to the leftist fascists that do whatev . . '' see the irony ? 
  you are mistaken if you think nd is a center party . 
  the economically and socially far right elements inside nd have taken over years ago . 
  that 's why they are doing abysmal in elections and in polls . 
  because the average center-right voter can not identify with them any more . 
  that 's why syriza is a government that has removed the fences blocking the parliament and does not send riot police to demonstrations . 
  even when the demonstrations are anti-syriza like the ones yesterday . 
  pro-austerity , pro-euro , anti-leftist . 
  well , i think the amount of tourism and the huge number of ships for such a small country as greece are pretty unique . 
  perhaps because greece has 5 times bulgaria 's gdp ? 
  riot police for what ? 
  yelling ? 
  they are n't even blocking the traffic . 
  well this article has sparked very interesting comment sections in greek websites . 
  economics nobel prize winner right there . 
  why even bother having elections then ? 
  let 's ban elections and welcome in our neoliberal overlords . 
  on a serious note , greece did what it was told for 5 years and the result was 27 % unemployment and an increase of debt to gdp from 108 % in 2008 to 185 % in 2014 . 
  it was only natural that the greek people would decide for a change in policy . 
  how did syriza manage to crash the economy in 4 months ? 
  are you implying that the economy was fine until syriza won the elections ? 
  unfortunately he has n't been able to do any of the things he promised . 
  minimum wage has n't changed , and athens port was completely privatized ( sold to cosco ) . 
  there were no previous terms agreed to . 
  there were rumors for new austerity measures meaning a third austerity memorandum that enraged the greeks and the elections were a result of these rumors . 
  the austerity measures agreed upon from memorandum 1 and memorandum 2 went through the greek parliament and were implemented in 2010 and 2012 respectively . 
  nonsense . 
  the previous terms were rumored to be 1.5 billion worth of cuts ( hardouvelis email ) . 
  the new terms are more than 5 billion . 
  including the privatization of the electric company + an increase of 10 % vat for electricity bills . 
  no government left or right would agree to this , hundreds of thousands would be left without electricity if that happened . 
  you got it backwards . 
  the eu leadership does not want to deal with the leftists that greeks voted for , so they gave much harder terms than the ones they gave to the previous right wing government 9 months ago . 
  one of the numerous quotes that have been falsely attributed to churchill my favourite is `` we should bomb germany once every 50 years no matter the reason '' . 
  it is particularly popular among greeks . 
  you know history , unlike 99 % of reddit and 100 % of historians . 
  hello american, 
  i literally have n't missed a bill maher show in years . 
  more like found the mra, 
  africans with afro hairstyle duh, 
  the british booze tourists . 
  to be fair , it is just one minister that asked for his resignation . 
  the rest of the government stands by mouzalas and does n't consider it an issue . 
  i 'm sure all these places do n't claim that greek macedonia belongs to them , or that they are descendants of ancient macedons etc. 
  in greece ? 
  nothing of the sort has been observed in greece yet . 
  lmao . 
  20.000 people is considered trampled ? 
  my little island of skiathos receives more than one million tourists during holiday season and the local population is 5000 . 
  you should be more concerned with british youth in crete and corfu and their booze tourism as a source of danger and crime . 
  you realise the only reason to avoid them is because for some tourists they are `` displeasing '' to look at . 
  there is no danger or any change in criminality because of them . 
  this however is mostly used for people . 
  earth = ge ( \u03b3\u03b7 ) , from the ancient primordial deity gaia, 
  new atheists like dick dawkins and sam harris claim that atheism is the result of the emergence of science . 
  also , theists claim that religiosity is ingrained in humans . 
  the article simply refutes these claims . 
  if you did n't know these claims existed , then the problem is with you and not the article . 
  `` social media gives legions of idiots the right to speak when they once only spoke at a bar after a glass of wine , without harming the community . 
  then they were quickly silenced , but now they have the same right to speak as a nobel prize winner . 
  it 's the invasion of the idiots . '' * umberto eco *, 
  as a greek i am offended . 
  zeus was the first to rape europa . 
  seriously , why is n't there a post about deutsche bank in / r/europe ? 
  my twitter feed has exploded today, 
  source ? 
  25 % of americans believe the sun rotates around earth . 
  40 % of the american people believe that jesus christ will return during their lifetime . 
  hm in greece we say `` do the chinese '' for exactly the same thing .
