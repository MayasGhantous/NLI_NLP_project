  so how many years do we have until the tyrannical feminist dystopia ? 
  the brownshirts marked `` juden '' on the front of your shop . 
  now the feminazis block and report your twitter . 
  i 'm telling you man , its a #whitegenocide and we should #bringbackthepatriarchy . 
  ( actual hashtags ), 
  yeah keep making nazi analogies . 
  they came for you ? 
  are you on your way to auswitch ? 
  guess the feminazis didnt take your iphone eh ? 
  preach it bro , next you will be picking cotton . 
  so you think that extremist islamists should be allowed to preach their twisted ideology inside eu in mosques or even in universities ? 
  actually , in the us , death penalty costs more than life in prison http://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2014/05/01/considering-the-death-penalty-your-tax-dollars-at-work/, 
   islam has been the main source of war since the end of ww2 , or at least the main excuse for it . 
  this subreddit has become more funny than any stand up comedian would ever hope to be . 
  i do n't know what that is and google is not helping . 
  what does puritanism have to do with sexism ? 
  [ reminds me of these guys ] ( http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/pix/pictures/2011/10/18/1318967280049/munich-agreement-007.jpg ), 
  yo mr edward lucas what about [ this handshake ] ( http://i.imgur.com/m6lvqe2.jpg ) ? 
  offtopic question : what happened during octoberfest ? 
  / r/europe was pretty sure that it would be a mess due to a clash between refugees and partying europeans . 
  any incidents ? 
  instincts are the need for food heat and shelter . 
  randomly trying to kill children is not an instinct , it 's just a result of a psychopathic ideology, 
  well you could browse / r/askhistorians and find out why that is . 
  he was sarcastic . 
  in greece we have a christianity course in high school and every so often there is mandatory church attendance . 
  also , at the start of the school year there is a sanctification event and every day before the classes begin the students say a prayer at the school yard . 
  rich guys wearing socks and sandals . 
  honestly i have trouble believing you . 
  the greek right wing views putin as the second coming of christ . 
  these videos are as far from the truth as possible . 
  but you use a lot of greek words even though you are not aware of it . 
  the internet was a mistake, 
  if you gon na post videos from altright channels , at least give warning first . 
  i do n't want to ruin my youtube recommendations . 
  i do n't know , did the chinese enslave and work europeans to death ? 
   it has long been asserted by `` responsible scholars '' that this decimation of american indians which accompanied the european invasion resulted primarily from disease rather than direct killing or conscious policy . 
  there is a certain truth to this , although starvation may have proven just as lethal in the end . 
  it must be borne in mind when considering such facts that a considerable portion of those who perished in the nazi death camps died , not as the victims of bullets and gas , but from starvation , as well as epidemics of typhus , dysentery , and the like . 
  their keepers , who could not be said to have killed these people directly , were nonetheless found to have been culpable in their deaths by way of deliberately imposing the conditions which led to the proliferation of starvation and disease among them . 
  certainly , the same can be said of columbus 's regime , under which the original residents were , as a first order of business , permanently dispossessed of their abundant cultivated fields while being converted into chattel , ultimately to be worked to death for the wealth and `` glory '' of spain . 
  of course they were not systematically killed just for the sake of being killed . 
  that 's why the holocaust is considered in a league of its own , since it is one of the very few instances that an ethnic group is being killed for no other reason than its extermination . 
  no , the natives were worked to death . 
  the kids that could not fill the quotas had their hands cut off and let to bleed to death . 
  the adults that got sick were worked until they could n't stand and then they were discarded etc. 
  from my point of view it makes no difference if you systematically kill a population or you work them to death . 
  the result is still the same . 
  in fact it bogles the mind that so many died so fast just because of diseases , malnutrition and working conditions . 
  https://www.amazon.com/american-holocaust-the-conquest-world/dp/0195085574 http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/764006.indians_are_us_culture_and_genocide_in_native_north_america the fact that the taino were eradicated in less than 30 years is not really disputed though .

  so according to you , hitler is not really to blame for the holocaust , since many of its victims died from disease and malnutrition . 
  and what about the holodomor ? 
  almost all of its victims died from disease and malnutrion , so it was just an `` unfortunate happening '' from the soviet leadership right ? 
  tbh people like you make me sick to my stomach . 
  how you dismiss the fact that an entire civilization was eradicated in the span of a single generation . 
  it was all worth it since spain became a superower !!!, 
  and then go on lamenting the victims of communism with a bleeding heart . 
  but soviet union also became a super power . 
  nazi germany also became a super power . 
  so according to your beliefs , maybe the genocides were worth it !, 
   in the april 1492 `` capitulations of santa fe '' , king ferdinand and queen isabella promised columbus that if he succeeded he would be given the rank of admiral of the ocean sea and appointed viceroy and governor of all the new lands he could claim for spain . 
  his rule commited so many atrocities , even by the era 's standards , that he was put on trial in 1500 . 
  the fact that this comment has so many upvotes is baffling . 
  columbus is probably the only person who has successfully eradicated an entire civilization , some 5 to 8 million taino native americans were killed . 
  literally not one of them survived his regime . 
  taino population at the start of columbus regime in the carribean islands : 5 to 8 million taino population at the end of columbus regime : zero what a great man indeed !, 
  not like these fucking commies . 
  taino population at the start of columbus regime in the carribean islands : 5 to 8 million taino population at the end of columbus regime : zero why are you lamenting the `` failed education system '' when you are clearly uneducated about columbus ' genocide ? 
   neonazis kill a man  antfascists paint a sign literally the same, 
  one woman was attacked because of her `` western values '' . 
  the other woman was attacked because of her `` muslim values '' . 
  you are trying to rationalize violence even though both instances are similar . 
  rofl , [ when right wingers talk about feelings ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnhjwusyj4i ), 
  conservatism belongs in the democratic spectrum . 
  by christian right i mean the fundamentalists , those who reject classical liberalism and the enlightenment . 
  the alt-right has its own thing called [ dark enlightenment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dark_enlightenment ), 
  there were numerous muslim ss units . 
  for example [ waffen-ss 13th division ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-awpilagxt58/vc9q8jex_ei/aaaaaaaaj0q/vot1sqgxso0/s1600/muslim%2bmembers%2bof%2bthe%2bwaffen-ss%2b13th%2bdivision%2bat%2bprayer%2bduring%2btheir%2btraining%2bin%2bgermany%2c%2b%2b1943.jpg ), 
  rekt, 
  when did napoleon set out to eradicate an entire race and use another one exclusively for slave labor ? 
  an `` extremist atheist '' is an obnoxious young adult on reddit . 
  an extremist muslim drives trucks into the crowd . 
  still , better to have edgy atheists than people who drive trucks into crowds of people, 
  i 'm sure he means the catastrophe of izmir . 
  for lehman brothers . 
  the line for db is from 2016 https://media.ycharts.com/charts/93d7473a6306cbfa45e90ecd4f289407.png, 
  we have plenty of car burning in greece . 
  all of it is done either by leftist rioters during protests or by football hooligans after a match . 
  the pro-erdogan group is homogenous . 
  the anti-erdogan group is splintered in many different factions , some of which hate the military just as much as they hate erdogan . 
  are you a dumb triggered nationalist ? 
  the article says that fruit salad is very common dessert in greece , which it is . 
  nothing more . 
  actually , there are alot of similarities between now and 1930 's germany . 
  alienation and disenfranchisement of the working class .
