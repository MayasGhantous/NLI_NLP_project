  i can relate to that in greece . 
  where as i was young , i went to a specific village near a beach ( kalithea ) to stay at with my family . 
  several years later i went with an ex and i saw all that cyrillic text too . 
  didnt understand what was going on . 
  selling furs in the middle of the summer . 
  but yeah tourism is tourism , 
  hahah , i wasnt mentioning where greece is , but more like the dna . ', 
  now i feel stupid hahah :p, 
  amarite ? 
  i cant figure it out where greeks are . 
  but i imagine that it 's a bit of the puple and green . 
  cause i usually hear that people think that i 'm from the balkans . 
  edit : i know that greece is in the balkans hehe , but i was ust wondering the dna of the greeks must be a mixture of the two . 
  hahaha , good one !, 
  thats true , but they are so small in numbers . 
  maybe thats why they werent included ? 
  greek is the family itself . 
  lonely, 
  at least you have a family :'(, 
  i would say because of occupations . 
  greek lost lands to arabs and turks . 
  there was a time when greek was the lingua franca . 
  why sweden ? 
  we caught him redhanded guys , take him outa here, 
  my dad told me that in the 60s in greece , romas would come to the village with the bears , and let it give a massage to people who got too stiff from working in the farms . 
  under the seaaaaa under the seaaaaaa, 
  to be fair , its all red , white and blue . 
  his name means ** sausage ** , as it was a boys name, 
  polan tro defender of katolicyzm !, 
  london ... wait for it ... ... ... derry . . im ready to be downvoated, 
  yeah . . greek people in greece arent the brightest nowadays , compared to greeks in the diaspora . 
  it feels like it 's a curse upon the lands of greece , the mentality is a but different there, 
  ha greece is having better immigrants than spain . 
  we get the pakistanis , which are ebola-free and comes with curry !,

  you dont believe alexander the great charged in battle yelling `` jeba\u0107u ti milosnu mater ! '' ? 
  in which way ? 
  except the language, 
  what does basque mean ? 
  is it something derived from your language ? 
  yeah probably , thats true, 
  is n't it what / u/thebyzantinedragon meant ? 
  aha , i see  i once heard that hungarian was related to some extend to turkish . 
  but i hardly believe that . . e.g. 
  they said the word apple were about spelled about the same, 
  yeah from what i 've understanded finns use very long words , that sometimes it ridiculous how long they can get . 
  but those are special cases . 
  thanks for the info mate , 
  ok thanks !, 
   very interesting, 
  i know that . 
  but i wonder cause in my ears it sounds similar to finnish . 
  but are the languages related as the danish/norwegian/swedish are to each other ?
