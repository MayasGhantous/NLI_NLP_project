  uppsala smokes a whole lot of weed . 
  should be ** helium ** hellas + belgium = helium , the land of squeaky voice, 
  like the trolls under the bridge lol, 
  it 's all drivers and farmers, 
  even if it were , they do n't have any connections to macedonia nor is there any important city located in fyrom from the times of alexander,

  i would probably say more kurds than turks . 
  because kurds say they 're from turkey and probably have turkish citizenship and many speak turskish too, 
   sometimes i think we should just act like israel and just not give a shit of what people say at all . 
  you 've done that a couple of times now, 
  because bulgaria exports romas and you do n't * throws fire in fire *, 
  i think malta is an indegrient in greek tzatziki, 
  greece-senpai always help, 
  alright guys , call it for today do n't want any youtube comment section here do we ? 
  captured him just to make it even more worse . . 
  one day when you have children , you 'll understand . 
  thats what they say lol, 
  well , we 're interested anyway , 
  even when it comes to your child ? 
  actually i do n't blame him . 
  striped tri-color flags can indeed confuse you sometimes, 
  oh man what a stupid article, 
  in greek the word spiti derives from the medieval word * espition * if i remember right . 
  espition was like the hostel in the east roman empire, 
  ww3 : the reich awakens, 
  which in turn was derived from the phonecian . . do n't tell other greeks, 
  yep , it 's lost in time . 
  do n't know if it ever existed , no idea, 
  in greek we still say `` galos '' to referre to a french, 
  i wonder what loot hides in there, 
  ai n't north africans = arabs ? 
  when i went to school in sweden , i was told it sounded like finnish . . perkele, 
  exactly, 
  dutch can sound a bit swedish too , some words are pretty similar to swedish made in sweden . 
   i wonder if it is the same for greeks hearing spaniards ? 
  greek here , yes spanish sounds like greek ( especially castillian i think , where they use * th * much ), 
  as is tradition, 
  can i be the third wheel in your conv . 
  steve jobs fault, 
  i dunno , i dont put much effort on iphones :p, 
  sitting on iphone . . 
  it 's a hussle, 
  greek : irini / irine, 
   macedonia [ ** triggered ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p5qbcraxvk ),

  nope, 
  turks are n't as religious as you like to believe . 
  in fact we should n't even eat pork . . but hey , here we are . . 
  so hard to learn and speak, 
  and then we have germans germans, 
  yeah ... finnish is like the chinese-speaker of europe . 
  you 're welcome , 
  yes . . now i 'm your tutor , listen to me and open your butthole, 
  sounds like something on discovery channel, 
  he is right , because of greeks wanted to take back what turks took/did before ( decapitating , killing , looting , etc ) , basically islamic mongols . 
  can you just imagine what they did to the greeks of anatolia before adapting some civilisation ? 
  thats what turks are known for , their ruthlesses on europeans , the yanissary child soldiers ( christian children kidnapped from their parents to force them to convert and kill their own people ) . 
  and much more . 
  but yeah , i dont hate them at all , i like them . 
  but i can imagine why people can be hating/nagging on turks . . google ` burning of smyrna ' for the referrence you were looking for . 
  thanks my ~ ~ barbarian ~ ~ german friend, 
  probably in a cave somewhere or tree swinging , cause there would n't be anything else than barbarian monkeys . . 
  ya barbarian monkeys , ya hear me !, 
  just so you can be the first masturbater of mars, 
  my grandmother/father were greek migrants in sweden in the 60s , my mom is born here , so am i. . 
  i 'm starting to be a bit xenophobic . . what does that make me ? 
  a-hole ? 
  im just worried about this country , i want swedish politicians to grow some balls . 
  i think that 's what greece did wrong, 
  like old times , ayee ? 
  that 's how the world wars started , at the middle of playground-europe :d, 
  i live in j\u00e4rvastaden , and i come to hate hallonbergenstation . . 
  sadly, 
   this is n't true . 
  i have no idea where the author got this information . 
  well the village is in ruines . . that 's a start, 
  modern greek ruins ... instead of ancient : ddddd, 
  one of the nationalistic suburbs of europe, 
  hello there neighbour !, 
  hi middle east canada !, 
  bigdaddy bigdaddy bigdaddy, 
  to be honest , i do n't think they 're beautiful languages :( but i would like to learn one of them . 
  mewp mewp, 
  tell me now . . how are fyromanians related to alexander the great ? 
  greek , swedish , spanish and no hablo ingles born in sweden with greek roots . 
  went to spanish classes in school and have a lot of spanish-speaking friends . 
  greek grammatic is similar to spanish , so it 's not too hard to learn .
