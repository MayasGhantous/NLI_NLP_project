  kant has explained why individuals are not means to an end , but ends themselves . 
  equating literal slavery with the `` wage slavery '' buzzword is just an attempt to discount centuries of philosophical work through propaganda-tier semantics . 
  `` worker 's interests '' no . 
  stop . 
  stop it with this class warfare bullshit that demonizes individualism and holds collectivism as the end of all ends . 
  there is no such thing as `` worker 's interests '' , there are only individuals that have certain rights . 
  one of these inalienable rights is private property , originating from man 's right to own his own body and the fruits of his labor . 
  what people choose to do with that labor is their own fucking business . 
  it 's a war of attrition against bureaucracy . 
  give it a few years . 
  the mistake is in assuming the majority of newcomers will contribute to the economy instead of leeching on social welfare . 
  you are being pedantic . 
  there is no system on earth that can undo the damage that was done to somalia in just a few years , and while lawlessness seems to have been an improvement over the socialist failures of the past , it will still take a long time for somalia to recover * regardless of system * . 
  this is the equivalent of telling socialists to move to north korea . 
  this lie needs to stop being perpetuated . 
  somalia is a [ failed socialist state ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/somali_democratic_republic ) , not a libertarian paradise . 
  things did however improve after the collapse into lawlessness , always by local metrics . 
  if you ca n't take ten minutes to educate yourself about your food , it 's nobody 's fault but yours . 
  people should n't blame corporations for their own mistakes . 
  the summer makes me feel groggy and depressed , to be honest . 
  i 'm happiest when it 's dark and cloudy . 
  future goals : move to iceland , never have to suffer through the summer again . 
  as posted below , greece is a safe country of origin according to the law . 
   `` a country is considered as a safe country of origin where , on the basis of the legal situation , the application of the law within a democratic system and the general political circumstances , it can be shown that there is generally and consistently no persecution as defined in article 9 of directive 2011/95/eu , no torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and no threat by reason of indiscriminate violence in situations of international or internal armed conflict . '',

'' greece is a safe country . 
  refugees have no legal basis to seek asylum in germany or eu states other than the country in which they originally arrived . 
  i 'm glad that dublin is being enforced ( even though greece wo n't benefit from it , europe as a whole will ) . 
  that 's not unsafe , that 's uncomfortable . 
  supposedly , they are fleeing warzones , right ? 
  just give them additional basic aid to make sure they are surviving and send them back once the war is over . 
  is greece currently engaged in a war ? 
  natural disaster ? 
  alien invasion ? 
  cataclysmic plague ? 
  what the writer does n't understand is that international law is only a gentleman 's agreement if you are powerful enough and/or have access to nuclear weapons . 
  it did n't stop the us , the ussr/russia or china from doing their thing before . 
  how are you going to enforce it ? 
  invade the eu with a coalition force ? 
  enforce sanctions ? 
  from whom ? 
  the us has a harsher stance on immigrants , russia already has retaliatory sanctions , china relies on trade with the west . 
  a reasonable opinion that goes against socialist dogma ? 
  on r/europe ? 
  have i stepped into a parallel universe ? 
  it * is * the same thing when the black list inevitably expands . 
  it 's just a technicality , the effect on censorship is the same . 
  i would love to see that compared with a map of economic performance . 
  it would n't be enough to prove a causative relationship , of course , but i 've believed for a long time that collectivism is at the very least a contributing factor to financial hardship because of a ` tragedy of the commons ' on a grand , country-wide scale . 
  go to gulag , do not pass go , do not collect daily 200 calorie ration ? 
  because their ideas are so batshit stupid they can only be accepted through violence . 
  the us has a good idea : if you are caught there illegally , you will be deported and banned from attempting to enter through a legal route . 
  you must really hate africans if you want to resurrect the evil empire just for them . 
  communism will just set them back by another few decades . 
  another failure of law enforcement in greece . 
  honestly , i think i would prefer it to this nauseating heat , it 's like hell . 
  iceland seems like a dream right now . 
  snow , cold , darkness . 
  are you people hiring desperate medical students ? 
  erdogan 's statements have almost devolved to kim jong un tier . 
  this . 
  i think the problem is that we * under * diagnose and * under * treat add in europe , not that they overmedicate in the us . 
  i think you mixed up utopia and dystopia , buddy . 
  `` it 's not real communism if it does n't result in a utopia '', 
  oh , i think * nobody * should have access to a publicly funded womb transplant . 
  nobody should have publicly funded ivf either . 
  if you want your own child , then pay for it , or just adopt . 
  i support equality of rights . 
  having children is not a right . 
  or we support the cause for equality , but find the idea of a national health system paying for optional procedures that are not related to one 's health absurd . 
  should the nhs fund facelifts next ? 
  never leave your house and blast the ac at turbo . 
  cry when the electricity bill comes . 
  things you can do with a gun : 1 ) hunt for food 2 ) defend yourself , your family and your property 3 ) shoot for sport 4 ) fight for your rights if a tyrannical government tries to take them away things you can do with a toilet : 1 ) piss and shit ? 
  you can do that without a toilet too . 
  damn right i would . 
  self defense is ** the ** most important of human rights . 
  any ` may issue ' law becomes a ` will not issue ' law very quickly . 
  and even then , you probably wo n't know your life is in threat until it happens . 
  yes , because * fuck * anyone who finds themselves in a position where they have to defend themselves . 
  if you live far enough from the city that the police ca n't be there in 30 seconds , you * deserve * to die . 
  i wish europe would vote in a eu second amendment . 
  in many countries , living outside a big city without a gun is the quickest way to be robbed , raped and/or murdered . 
  i never said that it 's great . 
  it 's supply and demand . 
  people get paid what they are worth . 
  in this case , the workers were worth more than they were being paid , and the market corrected . 
  nobody is being exploited . 
  this is just supply and demand . 
  the war on cash has to stop . 
  it gives governments and banks way too much power , and it makes it extremely easy to ruin someone 's life with just a few commands on a terminal . 
  communication and storage are intertwined in computer networks though . 
  arguably , trying to intercept the data before it is communicated compromises the * security * of the service , as outlined here :  ... weakening of the ** security ** and encryption of their networks and services ... 
  i want to see how it works with [ this ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6hu136/eu_to_force_facebook_and_google_to_give_police/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link ) . 
  ideally , this recommendation will prevail and any efforts to weaken privacy rights will be thwarted , but with the authoritarian streak currently on a roll i am not very optimistic . 
  that 's actually surprisingly accurate for greece . 
  property exists to be used * in whatever capacity its owner wants * . 
  maybe i want to turn my apartment into a storage closet for my trinkets , it 's nobody 's business . 
  if you want to drop the price of rent , then do away with the absurd zoning regulations that exist in various shapes around the globe and serve only to create a housing shortage . 
  i would kill for 21 degrees . 
  it 's already 31 over here and it 's unbearable .
