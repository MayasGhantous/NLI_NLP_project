  nobody forces you to buy a phone with ios . 
  if you decide that a closed system is n't for you , get an android , if you want the sense of simplicity that comes with a nanny os , get an iphone . 
  nobody owes you a phone . 
  if you do n't like what you see , buy from the competition or do n't buy at all . 
  they did n't have the arming and anti-tampering codes , if i recall , which were still in russian custody . 
  buzz off . 
  anyone who sacrifices our freedom and privacy for ` security ' should be struck on the head with a laptop . 
  yes please . 
  we are long overdue for some ** choice ** in how we get our healthcare . 
  you are right comrade . 
  lets abolish capitalism , then we can forcibly abort any pregnancy that risks messing up our statistics like cuba does . 
  might as well add ` reading guide : nazism and the european union ' and ` reading guide : insanity and the european union ' . 
  yeah , no . 
  if you are not being literally destroyed and need money to urgently prevent a disastrous collapse by war , famine or a pandemic , you really should n't borrow as a nation . 
  you are just stealing from the future . 
  it does n't matter whether you , i or the entire population consider it an unthinkable act . 
  for all we care , corbyn could be resolute that he would never launch a single nuclear missile , under any circumstances . 
  but publicly , and as far as the rest of the world aside from him is concerned , his finger should be constantly on that button and itching to press it at the first sign of a russian launch . 
  that is what keeps a nuclear war from breaking out : the guaranteed assurance that a nuclear first strike would be met with devastating retaliation , enough to make the costs of such a strike far greater than the gains . 
  the moment the prime minister of the uk shows hesitation , mutually assured destruction ceases to be the bulletproof shield it has been for decades . 
  so no . 
  i do n't want any family to be scorched at 1000 degrees . 
  which is exactly why i want the presidents of the us and france and the prime minister of the uk to constantly remind russia that nobody wins in a nuclear war , by the threat of landing a multi-megaton warhead in downtown moscow if necessary . 
  it does n't matter who survives . 
  it 's about the devastation that will follow . 
  by hitting just twenty cities in russia , you can take out 30 million people ( almost 25 % of their population ) , most of the government , huge swaths of industry and the military and cause an economic crash that would overshadow any material damage the bombs cause in the first days . 
  russia would be set back by centuries . 
  you do n't have to irradiate every inch of a country to cripple it in the ways that it hurts the most . 
  * this * is what kept nato and the ussr from blowing each-other up during the cold war . 
  just taking out moscow would be a tragedy of untold proportions . 
  maybe the uk would be completely wiped out by a nuclear war . 
  i wo n't sit and debate that . 
  but as long as it has the ability to cause more damage than it is worth , and constantly reaffirms that it * will * push the button if it is threatened , it will be safe . 
  why do you think states like iran and north korea want nukes so much ? 
  why do you think kim keeps saying that he will ` destroy the us ' if he is attacked , even if he lacks even the simple capability to reach the west coast with an icbm ? 
  it is about posturing , and anyone who does n't play will forever be a pushover at best , or a post-nuclear ruin at worst . 
  as i said below : it is only a fantasy as long as that ` someone ' ( hint hint nudge nudge ) is confident that nuking the uk will trigger a retaliatory strike . 
  mutually assured destruction is a huge game of chicken . 
  1984 was not supposed to be a guidebook , damn it . 
  even if a retaliatory strike feels pointless , the decisiveness to launch one in the unlikely event of a nuclear war is exactly what * prevents * nuclear warfare . 
  * even if * the prime minister is not willing to retaliate , all public statements must be in support of retaliatory strikes , or the idea of mutually assured destruction falls apart . 
  appearances are everything in nuclear war . 
  greek pensions were never paid for . 
  they are handouts for work that was never performed . 
  if you retired at 40 for no fucking reason , you * deserve * to get less than the poverty line . 
  reality . 
  let the market work for crying out loud . 
  in the ideal scenario where everything was matched on both ends ( prior education , skills , experience , family situation , ** negotiation skills ** ) , you might end up with a tiny difference because of health insurance costs , but it would n't be significant . 
  a supposed difference in the payments of male and female workers . 
  it was popularized by phrases like `` women earn 78 cents for every dollar a man does '' , but the numbers that these catch-phrases draw from are flawed in their representation of wage differences . 
  a report by consad titled `` an analysis of reasons for the disparity in wages between men and women '' conclusively debunked those exaggerated figures , and estimated that women earn 4.8 to 7.1 % less than men when matched for a handful of factors . 
  the report concluded that because many other factors were not examined , like health insurance disparity , the difference is likely to be even less and not useful as a comparison - and useless as a policy tool . 
  you can find it on many hosted websites by searching for the consad wage gap report , but the most reputable i found in a 30 second search was the [ university of hawaii ] ( http://www.hawaii.edu/religion/courses/gender_wage_gap_report.pdf ) because consad 's website seems to be down right now . 
  i urge you to read the consad report . 
   as a result , it has not been possible to develop reliable estimates of the total percentage of the raw gender wage gap for which all of the factors that have been separately found to contribute to the gap collectively account . 
  in this study , an attempt has been made to use data from a large cross-sectional database , the outgoing rotation group files of the 2007 cps , to construct variables that satisfactorily characterize factors whose effects have previously been estimated only using longitudinal data , so that reliable estimates of those effects can be derived in an analysis of the cross-sectional data . 
  specifically , variables have been developed to represent career interruption among workers with specific gender , age , and number of children . 
  statistical analysis that includes those variables has produced results that collectively account for between 65.1 and 76.4 percent of a raw gender wage gap of 20.4 percent , and thereby leave an adjusted gender wage gap that is between 4.8 and 7.1 percent . 
   additional portions of the raw gender wage gap are attributable to other explanatory factors that have been identified in the existing economic literature , but can not be analyzed satisfactorily using only data from the 2007 cps . 
  those factors include , for example , health insurance , other fringe benefits , and detailed features of overtime work , which are sources of wage adjustments that compensate specific groups of workers for benefits or duties that disproportionately affect them . 
  analysis of such compensating wage adjustments generally requires data from several independent and , often , specialized sources . 
  i am not arguing that there is absolutely no wage gap . 
  but it is certainly far , far less than what the media would like you to think , estimated as just 4.8 to 7.1 % ** without accounting for several factors that would reduce it further but can not be quantified from available data ** . 
   as a result , it is not possible now , and doubtless will never be possible , to determine reliably whether any portion of the observed gender wage gap is not attributable to factors that compensate women and men differently on socially acceptable bases , and hence can confidently be attributed to overt discrimination against women . 
  in addition , at a practical level , the complex combination of factors that collectively determine the wages paid to different individuals makes the formulation of policy that will reliably redress any overt discrimination that does exist a task that is , at least , daunting and , more likely , unachievable . 
  the wage gap has become a witch-hunt with a goal that ca n't be achieved . 
   '' ... we 're not beggars . 
  we do n't want money or political favours . 
  we just want things to run smoothly . '', 
  and this is exactly why they will forever be demonized by the government : because they do n't need it . 
  the greek government depends on buying voters with political favours and handouts . 
  but alas , the state has somehow managed to buy their votes too through ridiculous subsidies over the past decades . 
  the only metric that matters when debating the pay gap is hourly cost for equal work that also factors in all other forms of payment or alternatives . 
  comparing the average of all working women with the average of all working men is completely useless , as it does not account for differences in preferences . 
  when using that single useful metric , the wage gap either disappears or shrinks into the realm of statistical insignificance . 
  it is not the fault of companies if women choose fewer hours in lower-paying professions . 
   that 's not our european ideals , is it ? 
  if we 'd always go by the market , we 'd just kill all disabled people , as they are inefficient . 
  who said anything about killing anyone ? 
  talk about a reduction to absurdity . 
  the market is nothing else but a self-maintaining tool to balance available resources with preferences , like an advanced , adapting algorithm that takes the demands and offers of seven billion people and finds the best way to match them . 
  if the market for european media is not profitable , it 's because there is no demand for it . 
   they can not . 
  netflix , like all existing tv channels , also has to contribute to the local eu production funds , and in return can get easier access to content produced via their funding . 
  netflix also announced that that 'd be exactly what they 're doing , as they already considered moving more production to europe . 
  do n't mistake lip service for what will actually happen . 
  the best you can hope for is some logistical tricks to make productions count as european , while maintaining the same cultural pillars of american media that seem to work so well . 
  you are n't protecting culture , you are just propping up an inefficient industry for a few more years . 
   aha , but the us giving hollywood billions in subsidies is n't protectionism ? 
  when did i claim to be in favor of subsidies ? 
   i am against all forms of interference in the market , but what the eu does affects me more directly than what the us does . 
  perverse incentives . 
  here 's a quick breakdown : assumption 1 : current european media is not cost-effective to produce , license and broadcast for its popularity . 
  if there was enough of a market for it , it would already be successful . 
  assumption 2 : because you ca n't get anyone to define ` art ' the same way , the criteria for whether a piece of media ( movie/tv show ) is considered acceptable have to be based on run time . 
  alternatives , like budget , are counter-productive to the eu 's stated goal .
