  it has these `` get out of jail for free '' cards . 
  turkey has an unlimited number of them it seems , for some reason . 
  it has being doing that towards greece for decades . 
  but only now it seems other countries start to understand what greece has being going through for so much time . 
  at least countries like holland do n't have turkey 's f16s breaking borders and flying over their heads to inflict terror to the people on the ground . 
  troll of the year . 
  iceland , greece , and armenia stand out . 
  imia / kardak has been a ` gray ' zone , and neither greeks or turks have been allowed to land on it since 1996 . 
  not even fishermen . 
  there used to be nato ships near there , since 1996 , sending anyone who tried to get close back . 
  what did happened to them ? 
  that 's why i wrote `` wavf '' , how should i spell it ? 
  it would n't sound right because \u03b3 makes the sound of w. 
  let 's do it then . 
  in greece for cocks the most popular is kikirikoo or kokoriko . 
  for dogs wavf and waoo . 
  it was n't turkey that stopped the flow , it was the wall fyrom made . 
  even after the turkey-eu deal , lots of migrants kept arriving at greece . 
  they only stopped coming after fyr macedonia made a wall that got them stranded on greece . 
  because the migrants take advantage of international law . 
  if you find people at sea , you are obliged to collect them and take them on land . 
  if the borders were on land , they would have large walls already . 
  add to that , that many modern greeks feel that the capital city of their country is still under foreign occupation ( constantinupolis ), 
  there were once upon a time . 
  the existence and extinction of european lions soil is recorded in ancient greek books , they were extanct in the 4th century bc . 
  it 's everywhere . 
  on german euro coins too . 
  actual greek one : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/hellenicarmyseal.svg/150px-hellenicarmyseal.svg.png its phrase translates to : `` the ensouled may be free '' . 
  ensouled : one that has a soul . 
  are they copying persia ? 
  or north korea ? 
  i think that these are actors and play a role . 
  the commercial has a certain vintage aesthetic . 
  they chose to film it in a village with medieval arhictecture , the dress code of people is from older times ... 
  even the song they chose for it is from 1935 . 
  the commercial was quite accurate ... 
  if it wanted to depict greece of 1930 's or so . 
  so we greeks are the only ones that kept the final 's ' letter / sound in the name ? 
  i 'd expect italians would use it too ... as it 's a name they came up with . 
  i see . 
  here too we call one ` kosovar-os ' and the many ` kosovar-i ' , but since we write on english and i was n't sure how english say it , i thought of using some form that would sound usual to english speakers . 
  i now remembered an old albanian friend i had . 
  our favorite fast food here is souvlaki which usually has pork meat in it . 
  i remember her to prefer eating chicken stuff from kfc though , but i never combined it with religion because she never spoke about it . 
  i did n't knew kosov-ians were muslims . 
  are they shia or sunni , do you know ? 
  all the albanians i 've met in my life where atheists . 
  they are not , they are rather different . 
  im greek and i hear both languages all the time . 
  albanian because there are lots of albanians living here , and turkish because the tv plays stupid turkish soap operas . 
  what does the different colors means ? 
  what is this map even supposed to say ? 
  and even before that , greeks lived there and called the place tauris , a feminine word for ox . 
  unlike tauros ( taurus ) which is the male ox . 
  where i am from we have a law that forbids material that insults national and religious symbols . 
  lol, 
  i 'd avoid skin tax mountain . 
  a slavic minority lived in the byzantine empire . 
  some of them have lived in these places for several centuries , so it 's not weird that some places are known with slavic names . 
  nope . 
  its not the name of the island , but of a town in the island , \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03ae . 
  nope . 
  the name is \u0396\u03b1\u03c7\u03ac\u03c1\u03c9 , and sugar is spelled \u0396\u03ac\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b7 . 
  it litterally means ` sugary ' or ` sugarish ' . 
  well \u0398\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1 literaly translates to `` heat '' . 
  perhaps you might be right , but on that case i went with ` hot gates ' because that 's what most people will know the place as , as the movie 300 was so popular . 
  funny names are n't they ? 
  xd i did n't even knew these places there had such names until i started making this map . 
  in modern greek we use the word triandafyllo for this flower . 
  but the name rhodos itself means this flower , too . 
  sorry , there were so many names i did n't knew which to pick or not . 
  it was also rather late and i was sleepy ... :(, 
  its a wall of trees and bushes thut block the sea view . 
  what 's wrong with goats ? 
  goats make nice milk . 
  better than the cows do . 
  it means the object you would put a soup in it to boil it , not something that can be smoked though :p, 
  hehe yes . 
  i was troubled on picking some of them . 
  as there are many names , that either do n't mean anything , or they are single non-composite words like `` field '' or `` donkey '' . 
  but some composites are kind of fan like `` horn-bearer '' ( keratea ) or `` honeymilk '' ( meligalas ) . 
  thanks !, 
  so interesting . 
  i made a version for greece : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5exo2y/a_map_of_greece_with_village_city_and_town_names/, 
  if turkey fights greece while both countries are in nato , the us will not help turkey , it 's against the rules of nato . 
  now if you are talking about a situation where there is no nato ... we will get lost with all these ` what ifs ' eventually . 
  you are welcome . 
  yes , this year is warmer than past few ones . 
  heh ... that 's autumn and spring temps for us in athens . 
  at winter the usual is between 8c and 0c , and the lowest i experienced was down to -4 . 
  at that point i did n't knew what to wear . 
  i had so many layers of clothing they made me look double my size . 
  as for summer , the usual is 35c to 39c , but the most extreme i experienced in my life was 48c !!, 
  at that day the media were instructing people all day , saying we 'd better not go outside if there is n't a very serious reason , and if we do , to stay away from sunlight and always carry a bottle of water along . 
  i do n't really know about that . 
  perhaps . 
  but that does n't mean that far right is good . 
  dorians were one of the many tribes of the people that called their ethnicity ` hellenic ' . 
  the hellenic people were united and assimilated to a common nation during alexander the great . 
  yes .
