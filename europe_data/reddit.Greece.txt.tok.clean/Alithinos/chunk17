  except turkestan , the indigenous land of turks . 
  which was taken by the chinese , who renamed it xin jiang . 
  it means ` take ' . 
  the other words mean ` come ' and ` mongol ' the phrase \u039c\u03bf\u03bb\u03ce\u03bd \u039b\u03b1\u03b2\u03ad is a famous quote of leonidas of sparta . 
  he said to the persians `` come and take them '' , when they asked to surrender their weapons . 
  on a 1vs1 combat , turkey . 
  but turkey has very bad relations with all of its neighbours . 
  if they are any smart , and turkey is so stupid to attack greece , then the kurds , armenians , and perhaps assyrians too would fight turkey from the east , and in that case turkey would n't probably hold up . 
  oh and did i mentioned that iran also dislikes turkey ? 
  tsipras was n't against sanctions on iran without reason ... , 
  istanbul still is n't in greek hands :( it seems we will never get our old and holy capital city back again , no matter how turkey is split . 
  excuse me ? 
  far right exists in all countries . 
  i did n't said that there is n't far right in greece if that 's what you are trying to say . 
  and golden dawners are equally as stupid as great albanianers . 
  other , poorer countries do pay the 2 % each year . 
  why denmark , or others not pay for it ? 
  but even wikipedia pages may use terms wrongly . 
  literaly translates to `` nativety '' , as being a native of place , ie belong to the first group of people that ever got to a place to stay at it . 
  as for \u03b5\u03b8\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1 ( ethnicity ) , that 's a more complex issue . 
  because the translation of the term ` nation ' to \u03ad\u03b8\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ( ethnos ) in greek is simply bad translation . 
  beacuse as sloes wrote the idea of nation is pretty young , from the 18th century , and it is about how one feels . 
  so if someone feels american , he will belong to the american nation , no matter if he is black , white , or asian , no matter if he is christian , muslim , or jew . 
  but the greek word ethnos has an entirely different meaning , and is way older , it 's at least from the classical antiquity era . 
  an ethnos is a total of people that : have common ancestry , ethics , customes , ways , language , and religion . 
  so nation and ethnos are very different . 
  but alexander was a muticulturalist . 
  not for whole greece . 
  at pindos its already snowing . 
  it 's not really warm . 
  the temps during day these past weeks range from 20 to 13c , and during night from 15c to 10c . 
  still , the coldest months for athens and around it are january and february . 
  it 's at these months that temp falls down to 0c . 
  i think it would be much more reasonable for albanian patriots who love their country to be trying to make albania a better place to live , for them and their children . 
  extending borders does n't help them in any practical way to achieve that , it would just be extending the povetry of albania further away . 
  but that 's what the system does . 
  whenever the government fails to do something meaningful for its people , far right sprouts up to blame the other , and generates nationalistic hate to direct anger towards foreigners because otherwise the anger would be directed against the government for its failures . 
  if i was an albanian i would n't care at all at expanding albania 's borders . 
  instead i 'd do what i can and demand from albania 's government to bring in jobs , raise minimum wage , etc. 
  but the far right does its job . 
  is n't shangai chinese though ? 
  do n't turkish and chinese have a problem with each other , because of the turkic people in turkestan / xin jiang ? 
  usually most conspiracy theorists support the other side though . 
  the thing is that from what i heard what was inside the truck was far-right flyers about `` great albania '' and how all neighbours of albania are evil . 
  far right exists everywhere , but just right now i read that these people bringing this material were state workers . 
  that complicates things a bit . 
  we eat some common foods . 
  other than that , i do n't see how we are cultural similar . 
  \u03a6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf ( filotimo ) : the inner feeling that you have to do the right thing , not mistreat anyone , but be just and compassionate with all . 
  \u039b\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 ( logos ) : a word that is about something that humans have that is hard to describe . 
  logic is related to logos , the same way politics are related to polis . 
  so logic is n't a thing of its own self , but something that is immidately related to logos , and could n't exist without logos . 
  logos is the ` mother ' of logic , reason , and words , as the process of thinking involves words , as we think in our language . 
  so logos is this concept . 
  \u0392\u03ac\u03c1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 ( barbarian ) : essentially the meaning of the word is `` someone who has not the culture , language , ways and costumes of greeks '' . 
  ancient greeks also used a verb related to this word , that was used to describe other greeks in some occasions , '' \u0392\u03b1\u03c1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd '' ( barbar-ing ) which meant `` speaking or acting like a barbarian '' . 
  \u0395\u03bd\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1 ( henad ) : the concept of one consisting of many parts that are all in unison in such a way so they all form and act as one . 
  \u0399\u03c3\u03b7\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 ( isegoria ) : the concept of listening to what one has to say and judge his words on their own merit , no matter who he is that says them . 
  \u0388\u03b8\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ( ethnos ) : it is a word that wrongly is often translated as ` nation ' , but it 's meaning is considerably more specific . 
  the term ` nation ' as we mostly use it , means a total of people who feel like they have something binding them together that differentiates them from other people . 
  so someone can belong in the american nation and be a muslim , or have a 100 % african ancestry , if they feel americans . 
  but ethnos is reffering to a total of people that have the same ancestry , language , religion , ways , customes , and worldview . 
  those people who have all this in common , will belong to the same ethnos , even though they might belong in different nations . 
  \u0398\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 ( theos ) : this word is translated as ` god ' , but lot of its meaning is lost in translation . 
  greeks called zeus , hera , etc with that word . 
  but the literal meaning of the word means `` one who travels fast '' , and they called these beings like that , because people from one village would say that let 's say apollo visited them one day , then people of a village 10 days away would say that apollo visited their own village one day after he visited the first village ... 
  so they they thought of calling these beings with a word that kind of means `` fast traveling individual '' . 
  what 's racist in what i wrote ? 
  is this some kind of sarcasm , a joke ? 
  because i do n't get it . 
  really ? 
  the media have n't said anything about it . 
  this picture is not the original , its zoomed in version of a larger map . 
  lebanon has more greek genes than greece . 
  interesting . 
  thank you very much !, 
  ca n't do that , or else will be labeled ` racist ' . 
  i wonder what will come out of this . 
  something seems staged , something smells fishy . 
  yelling ` allahu akbar '' is something you do n't understand ? 
  as if algerians firing fireworks against random people while yelling `` allahu akbar '' are any better . 
  it 's good they stole a fireworks shop and not an actual gun shop . 
  its the way of thinking of retaliation . 
  `` you did that to me ? 
  i will do that to you ! '', 
  the day the place was burn , media said that the migrants rebelled , stole fireworks , and started firing them in their camp burning it down , to policemen , etc. 
  next day and after the camp was burned to the ground , media started saying that golden dawn went and started a fire in the refugee camp . 
  you do n't know what to believe . 
  i wish i had a gun . 
  yeah , that 's the dream of every raped woman , to be with her rapist for the rest of her life . 
  oh erdogan , how we did n't thought of that before ? 
  first they tell them to come to europe , then they block their way out of greece , then they put them in walled camps ( practically in jail ) , then they leave greece to short it out herself . 
  things are getting rather weird . 
  first britain removed itself out of the eu , then americans elected trump , now polonians did this . 
  what will be next ? 
  something tells me that there are a lot of things to see before this awkward year goes away . 
  because its not in the eu . 
  rhineland is obviously from the river rhine . 
  danovia from the river danube . 
  i guess these names will have some meaning for the people living there or close by .
