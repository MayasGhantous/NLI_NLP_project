  as i said in my previous comment as well , i was referring to the generalization  the amount of money earned in relation to the amount of money spent is an accurate indication for whether you are capable of managing your money or not . 
  not in the greek situation . 
  not when you can get cheap financing . 
  if the loans you get are cheaper than what you will get by the growth that a deficit would provide , then it 's to the country 's benefit to run a deficit . 
  sometimes it 's unavoidable . 
  prolonged periods of crisis , large works etc. 
  there were no comparison made . 
  my reply was to the quoted part . 
   he amount of money earned in relation to the amount of money spent is an accurate indication for whether you are capable of managing your money or not . 
  not the rest . 
  common people like generalizations . 
  on the contrary , data like this is very narrow both in terms of interpretation and , well , usefulness . 
  how can you define `` hard working '' ? 
  it 's pretty relative term , very broad and very dependent on social bias . 
  typical work conditions in china would make a chinese worker a very hard working person in germany . 
  on the other hand , a typical german worker would be considered lazy in china . 
  never mind the fact that hard working / lazy are actually character traits and not national traits . 
  what you can compare are absolute terms and not generalize them . 
  silly example : dutch people 's mean/average height is larger than the canadian mean/average . 
  does this mean that netherlands produce more nba players ? 
   the amount of money earned in relation to the amount of money spent is an accurate indication for whether you are capable of managing your money or not . 
  that 's wrong . 
  [ many times ] ( http://www.econdataus.com/primary-deficit-2011.html ) you spend more than you make as a country , even including interest payments . 
   if you earn less than $ 1.25 per day you are definitely poor . 
  in the central african republic that 's almost the average . 
  not saying that 's not poor though , but it 's still relative . 
  is there a problem with my language ? 
  you claimed that raising the ela is `` help '' . 
  i said it 's not . 
  and you follow it up with whether i noticed that the ela was frozen ? 
  i live in greece , of course i noticed the lack of liquidity . 
  or maybe , just maybe , the actual reason behind your post has nothing to do with what we 're talking about and you 're solely interested in bashing varoufakis . 
  in which case , make a new post . 
  there 's bound to be more people of the same mind as you . 
   you mentioned how about how austerity was making things bad in greece . 
  i 've stopped here . 
  you 're again doing the same thing . 
  again point me to somewhere i said anything of the kind . 
  or are you going to spam me again with wall of texts about how corrupt is the greek government etc etc ? 
   i could make the case that productivity is an indicatior of hard work , hours worked an indicator of how hard working one is you would be wrong . 
  when you have an automated factory that makes 100 stuff per day with 4 part-time employees and a factory with the same output but instead of automations , it has 100 full time employees , can you make any assumptions about who 's working harder ? 
  the first factory 's production would be through the roof . 
  does this mean the 4 part-time employees work * harder * because their output/hours worked is larger ? 
  or you have a person owning a small cafe . 
  he works there 16h per day chasing flies most of the day . 
  is he more hard working that a miner doing 4-6h shifts ? 
  or you have two exact same factories catering to local needs . 
  one is located in luxemburg , the other in zimbabwe . 
  are the luxemburg workers more hard working than the zimbabweans because their products are worth more in their respective markets ? 
  -----  and more importantly average pension how well a pensioner has it . 
  pension is fixed , you do not have to worked for it , therefore you can move anywhere in the world and enjoy a great lifestyle . 
  i do not care how you spin it , pension income is a good indicator , of ones quality of life . 
  again , wrong . 
  say you 're on a pension at $ 1000/month . 
  now you have two options , live in luxemburg or live in the philippines . 
  where would you be better off with that amount of money ? 
   i do not care how you spin it , pension income is a good indicator , of ones quality of life . 
  by itself , no , it is not . 
  and it 's not `` spinning '' . 
  without taking into account the actual purchasing power among other factors , it says ** nothing ** . 
  ecb froze the ela program because of the uncertainty factor . 
  since the road for a deal is being paved they restarted it , albeit of course a small piece at a time . 
  this will get larger as things get more stable . 
  keeping the ela frozen hurts the chances of stability . 
  so instead of going all out ( increasing the ela by the actual demand ) or not increasing it at all , they chose to do a first step that promotes stability . 
  it 's not `` help '' , they are not doing any favors . 
  it 's the ecb 's main function . 
  where exactly did i say '' ** end ** austerity '' ? 
  i like that you 're putting it in quotes as well ... go do your greek-bashing somewhere else . 
  well it 's a step on the right direction . 
  i hope the dust settles soon and people will return all their cash to their deposits . 
  $ 900m wo n't last long under a climate of fear . 
  31 pages , with a photo and a small paragraph of 3 lines to describe each custom on each page ... ** no thanks . 
  what stat are you basing your prediction on ? 
  :p -- but yeah , you 're right ... 
  yes . 
  we call them `` under extinction '' . 
  -- on a more serious note ( heh ) , when we had the drachma , as the americans call their $ 100 bills franklins , we called the 5000 note `` kolokotronis '' - the person depicted on the note . 
   why do you seem to take it for granted that other countries have to help you they do n't * have * to help us . 
  it 's in their interest to do so . 
  it 's in their interest to make provisions so this thing wo n't happen again as well . 
  let 's be realistic here : our partners do not want to forgo their loaned money and that 's perfectly fine . 
  but at this juncture they wo n't get their money back , they * ca n't * get their money back , without helping greece . 
  i am not claiming this is fine but it 's the way things stand . 
  either accept the loses and move on , or provide help in the hope that they 'll get - part or whole of - their investment back . 
  there is no middle ground . 
  no debt haircut . 
  x years of no payments . 
  tie debt repayments to growth after that till the economy reaches sustainable numbers - say a target of y % debt to gdp . 
  put in a clause for fiscal discipline : if greece gets above 2 % of deficit for more than 2 years running , then enact hash austerity to be put back on track . 
  after two years of balanced budget , relax austerity again . 
  make the greek irs to be an independent agency . 
  set expected targets of income based on professions . 
  audit people/businesses who declare less than said target . 
  make surprise audits to people/businesses in general . 
  promote the use of plastic money . 
  etc etc there are many solutions . 
  but said solutions do n't fit the current `` suggested '' european model . 
  come now with sch\u00e4uble 's proposal ... 
  think of it realistically .
