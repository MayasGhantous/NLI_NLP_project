  is there ** any ** chance , ** any ** chance at ** all ** that greece would be able to fulfill maastricht criteria in just `` 5 years '' after a grexit ? 
  it 's not temporary exit . 
  so do n't listen to sugar-coated crap spewed by sch\u00e4uble . 
  it 's a grexit . 
  not temporary . 
  no time-outs . 
  and as far as the `` help '' we will be provided in this case , you think that they 'll extend more help when they 're not even bound by any eu mechanisms ? 
  please . 
  now it 's somewhat eu 's problem as well and look at the helping hand they extend . 
  imagine greece leaving the ez , how can they even suggest to their voters extending help to a nation that is not even part of the euro ? 
  if he was realistic , then he would n't suggest a `` temporary '' exit . 
  it 's far from realistic to support that greece would be able to fulfill maastricht criteria in 5 years after such a messy grexit . 
  when he is lying from the out-start , how can you trust sch\u00e4uble ? 
  5 year break ? 
  `` temporary '' exit ? 
  he is implying that in 5 years we 'll be able to meet the maastricht requirements to reintegrate ourselves in the ez ? 
  that 's bollocks . 
  people here are admiring sch\u00e4uble 's realism , but after a grexit , a greek return to a ez membership is less likely than an actual rebounce of the greek economy inside the euro . 
  the 50bn is not a target to be met at a specific date . 
  i was talking about the `` reforms '' , the changes in the taxation , social security etc. 
  if we apply all said measures and we are far from the fiscal targets , we are far from any growth , i wo n't be expecting a pat in the back . 
  either their politicians will try to skew the facts or they 'll be forced to accept the truth . 
  i was hoping that till then our `` capable '' politicians would have made provisions for the first case - prepared for an orderly default and a change of currency . 
  secret ? 
  well ... i had * other * hopes for sch\u00e4uble . 
  not bad mind you , nothing like say an anvil landing on his face , but a retirement somewhere nice , like the bavarian alps . 
  in a remote house on the top of the mountain . 
  with no phone or internet . 
   i am pretty sure you laughed , you deleted it but then you looked outside , stared up at the stars , the cool wind slapped your face and you said `` fuck it ... lets be optimistic '' exactly what happened . 
  apart from going out though . 
  i just stared at the ceiling . 
  and the air was from my cooling fan . 
  as a greek , i do n't blame either side at this point . 
  i mean , you ca n't * really * believe this new proposal will work . 
  nor can you say that adopting the drachma would be our salvation . 
  after the fact , i just hope that our government does the best it can to implement ** everything ** our partners demanded of us so when things reach crisis levels again , there wo n't be any talks about `` greece '' not wanting to reform and such . 
  maybe then , we can have an honest deal . 
  does n't frau merkel know the unwritten law ? 
  if you start by `` i do n't discriminate '' and you put follow it by a `` but '' ... you 're discriminating . 
  ** 229 yes | 64 no | 6 present ** -- 39 no / present / absent from syriza . 
  we 're still to see how bad it hurt syriza though . 
  flash crashed on me half way through while i was doing the count : / . 
  fucking flash ... 
  veterinary ? 
  thanks . 
  i probably lost it during buffering : /, 
  thanks . 
  i probably lost it during buffering : /, 
  did i miss it ? 
  what was the reference ? 
  they did have an 8 % salary `` cut '' in order to suffer with the common people . 
  well considering what 's at stake and that we have people there who are under investigation by the law , it 's pretty mild . 
  let the mic in peace venizelos , it 's not a souvlaki ... 
  hm ... well , in the autumn it 's gmt +2 . 
  funny , did n't know it changed . 
  err , in 52minutes if that helps . 
  from what the president of parliament said , they need to have completed the procedure by midnight , so yeah , greek time ( gmt +2 ), 
   nothing he said is crazy . 
  well , we was n't * that * aggressive today . 
  though the bullet point translation does not give it justice , trimming his talk down does n't transfer his mien . 
  \u0399 had to take 2 antiemetics from my disgust , and it 's been only half an hour since it started . 
  i do n't think even * they * could last that long . 
  by midnight it should be over ( 00:00 16/7/2015 ) . 
  yeah , not really a good journalistic behavior , even if it 's golden dawn . 
  i did a bullet point translation if you 're interested in it . 
  ** bullet points ** it 's traitorous that a 61 % no became yes on a worse proposal . 
  eu is calling for an end for the early pensions . 
  but it was them who forced/urged greek farmers to early retirement so that eu farmers would benefit . 
  vat is not a good tax for the poor , it 's a capitalistic tax . 
  media did not show gd views at all . 
  when the greek government heard about the 50bn fund , they should have left as soon as they heard about it being in luxemburg . 
  that fund being located in greece does n't change things much . 
  we 're being forced to vote on what to sell on bakeries , pharmacies etc. 
  and even worse , they 're asking us to recall the laws we made . 
  we are being blackmailed . 
  remember siemens et.al in the 80 's . 
  we had the first suit by a private party against the ecb for the ela freeze . 
  what ecb did was a crime , but larger crime was that the political parties did n't do what the private party did . 
  gd says that return to productivity will only save greece . 
  only greeks can save greece . 
  the new measures will not work , it will make things worse . 
  you 're punishing those who have houses to rent but not to the offshore companies . 
  no to the proposals . 
  yes to democracy . 
  ------ i was being a bit mild though . 
  well , not happening , so see you again in 1-4 years i guess . 
  no , it 's my fault for not being clear enough . 
  selling unused land owned by the greek government to private investors is fine . 
  forfeiting sovereign control is not . 
  there is literally no way this will be happening . 
  on the first whiff that something like that is going to transpire and the government will fall . 
  they 'll burn the building the `` new fund '' is located to the ground . 
  they can sell every single public company . 
  they can lease public land for 99 years . 
  but even mentioning a permanent sale of sovereign lands and you 'll have a riot . 
  and we 're not talking about 30000 people protesting in the center of athens . 
  we 're talking about millions getting their modern equivalent pitchforks and hunting down everyone responsible . 
  and the police would be there with them . 
   what looks bad is the german state holding and selling of greek state assets . 
  forcing greece to turn over assets in this way outside a settlement after war is really shocking .
