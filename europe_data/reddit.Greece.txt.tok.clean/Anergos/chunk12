  it kind of undermines the idea of national sovereignty or of one state respecting the integrity of other states . 
  you should n't be shocked that sch\u00e4uble had such a plan . 
  what you should be shocked about was that sch\u00e4uble has the support of the majority of his citizens for this plan . 
  i mean sure , i expected the german public to be supportive of very harsh measures , but this ? 
  which other side of the argument ? 
  it 's not me we 're talking about , it 's the chair of the supervisory board of the single supervisory mechanism of ecb . 
  you do n't have to take my word for it . 
  i am not claiming our banks did not have any problems . 
  i 'm claiming ecb said our banks did not have any problems . 
  also , any bank will fail under capital controls under those circumstances . 
  and talking about stress tests , you know which * other * bank failed a stress test ? 
  [ deutche bank ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/deutsche-bank-fails-us-stress-test/a-18309245 ) . 
  it 's all definitions and legalese . 
  because that would mean the sacrifices of our grandfathers would amount to simply money . 
  there is a lawsuit by the greek financial adviser alcimos against the ecb against that exact matter . 
  they froze ela while they admitted some days before that the greek banks had no issue . 
  as for the financing , who on earth would invest in a country ready to default ? 
  let 's be serious . 
  that is n't possible . 
  plus you 'd be damn sure we 'd quit ez and euro , decimate the population from hunger and sickness before selling a single greek rock in our seas . 
  if he was talking about the stress test they failed , then would this  ... these banks continue to be solvent and liquid . 
   ... that was also visible in the outcome of our stress test . 
  be a reasonable response ? 
  also , greece missed the payment after the interview was given , the deadline was june 30 , the interview was given june 7 . 
  but hey , i 'm making stuff up , right ? 
   the stress test you 're referring to were during 2014 . . 
   http://www.marketwatch.com/story/three-greek-one-cyprus-banks-fail-ecb-stress-test-2014-10-27 ** 27-10-2014 ** -- the interview was talking about the tests done 2015 . 
  which for some ungodly reason , i ca n't find . 
  [ google cache ] ( http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:qlhlid5kuqej:https://twitter.com/kazimirpeter/status/620628845994115072+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us ) has it when i took a [ screenshot ] ( https://i.imgur.com/9vb0n9l.jpg ) . 
  there is no chance in hell that 50bn of assets can be found in greece . 
  it was just a tidbit so merkel can pass the proposal through their parliament . 
  we could n't reach the 2-5bn of privatizations , now we 'll find 50 ? 
  let 's just hope that they wo n't sell everything in a firesale and that at least a portion of it would go to actual investments ... 
  he deleted that tweet from what i can tell . 
  here 's a [ screengrab ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9vb0n9l.jpg ) for people bored to do a check . 
  definitely . 
  it would also have demonstrated the value of cohesion in the eu and what would happen if ( or more probably when ) another country got into trouble . 
  yeah but that with essentially a balanced primary budget . 
  imagine having to reach 3.5 % ... 
  * copy paste from another of my posts * ----- the stress test you 're referring to were during 2014 . 
  according to the interview of dani\u00e8le nouy , chair of the supervisory board of the single supervisory mechanism , 7 june 2015 :  meanwhile you may perhaps have slight doubts about your earlier statement that greek banks were absolutely solvent and liquid . 
   no , i do n't : these banks continue to be solvent and liquid . 
  the greek supervisors have done good work over the past years in order to recapitalise and restructure the financial sector . 
  that was also visible in the outcome of our stress test . 
  the greek institutions have experienced difficult phases in the past . 
  but they have never before been so well prepared for them .

  well , the ecb 's reaction did call for `` energetic '' reaction . 
  just half month ago our banks passed the cash tests with flying colors , 15 days later they were n't ? 
  yeah . 
  probably some shuffling from the far left parts of siriza , will be made up by the support of the opposition . 
  i was not talking about the referendum . 
  i was talking about the hilarity of the statement when we were stripped of all modicum of dignity during the negotiations . 
  i was trying to drive home that the amount of german imports that are bound to import duty are orders of magnitude larger than greece . 
  it 's one of the reasons why german contributions to the eu budget is that large . 
  we sent the message of dignity to whole world . 
  outright debt haircut no . 
  longer extensions etc etc yeah . 
  considering that one of the most profitable national companies in greece ( opap ) was sold for 750m , i do n't think they 're be anything left after said $ 50bn . 
  that was before the crisis ... 
  ** ** revenue ** ( [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/mff/resources/index_en.cfm ) ) 1 . 
  traditional own resources : consist mainly of customs duties on imports from outside the eu and sugar levies . 
  eu member states keep 25 % of the amounts as collection costs . 
  own resources based on value added tax ( vat ) : a uniform rate of 0.3 % is levied on the harmonised vat base of each member states . 
  own resources based on gni : each member state transfers a standard percentage of its gni to the eu . 
  although designed simply to cover the balance of total expenditure not covered by the other own resources , this system has become the largest source of revenue of the eu budget . 
  now do you really want to compare germany imports to greek imports ? 
  greece mainly imports non tariff ( or special tariff ) products ( oil ) . 
  most of the imports come from within the eu apart from a messily 5 % that comes from china . 
  germany 's huge exporting capability is based on a similarly huge importing capability . 
  where greece imports pharmaceuticals from france and pays no custom duties , germany imports electronics from china . 
  you know what is n't visible on the chart ? 
  the amount germany would pay if there was import duty on the cars and tvs and refrigerators greece imports from germany . 
  that 's what germany gains . 
  want to compare gni between germany and greece ? 
  1300 % higher . 
  so , greece is asking for `` donations '' ? 
  but romania asked for loans ? 
  that 's why we are beggars and you are not ? 
   but it looks like you 'll get those things with the euro too . 
  if they restore ela , no we wo n't . 
  people might not have the money to purchase stuff , but the market would not have shortages . 
   you ca n't pay the debt at the moment , either way you turn it . 
  yeah but apart from some niche cases , what does the debt has to do with shortages ? 
   your best option seems to be rebooting your economy by using a devalued currency . 
   once your economy begins to generate revenues you can pay part of the debt . 
  if they can offer a deal for debt restructuring/relief after a grexit , why ca n't they offer the same deal within the eu ? 
  you 're assuming that everyone would allow for a non-messy default . 
  judging by today 's happenings , that wo n't be the case . 
   as for the temporary shortages , it might be possible to negotiate a loan to prevent those , in exchange for the temporary ` grexit . ', 
  why do you thing that a grexit is something that people want to pay for ? 
  do you think germany would `` pay '' us to grexit ?
