  i am not claiming it 's all truths . 
  but i seriously doubt it 's all lies either . 
   so , why did you kick your government then , exchanging it for an anti-reform one ? 
  because most people deemed 5 years is enough to give a set of measures time to show any ( and i mean ** any ** ) type of improvement . 
  if the previous government could say , hey look at what we 've accomplished . 
  never mind how minute , but something tangible , there would not have been a new government . 
  instead you know what we got ? 
  reports on new tax increases , new recessionary measures , new cuts . 
  with nothing to show for .

  but it does n't matter , as we caused it , right ? 
  it 's our stubbornness . 
  we are refusing all those great solutions that have proven so effective these past 5 years .

   to believe that germany has some kind of mean spirit and wants to hurt greece by making it suffer is ridiculous and laughable . 
  i am just going to quote [ timothy geithner , former us treasury secretary about the g7 meeting in canada in 2010 ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11226828/tim-geithner-reveals-in-the-raw-how-europes-leaders-tried-to-commit-financial-suicide.html ) . 
   i remember coming to the dinner and i 'm looking at my blackberry . 
  it was a f *** ing disaster in europe . 
  french bank stocks were down 7pc or 8pc . 
  that was a big deal . 
   for me it was like , you were having a classic complete carnage because of people saying : crisis in greece , who 's exposed to greece ? 
  i said at that dinner , that meeting , because the europeans came into that meeting basically saying : ` we 're going to teach the greeks a lesson . 
  they are really terrible . 
  they lied to us . 
  they suck and they were profligate and took advantage of the whole basic thing and we 're going to crush them . ', 
  [ that ] was their basic attitude , all of them . 
  that 's not only about germany of course , but it exhibits the spirit concerning greece . 
  just so we 're not hiding behind our fingers . 
   but the greek refuse to cooperate . 
  [ just saying . 
  ] ( http://blogs-images.forbes.com/stevekeen/files/2015/02/image0011.png ), 
   he previous governments , and even more the one currently in power , have not introduced needed reforms or show any sign that they will happen that is something i keep hearing about . 
  what did prompt the 30 % reduction in gdp if not for the measures taken ? 
  why did [ oecd put greece first in their attempts for reform ] ( http://blogs-images.forbes.com/stevekeen/files/2015/02/image0011.png ) ? 
   that 's exactly why there wo n't be debt relief . 
  if there 's debt relief for greece , there has to be debt relief for italy , or spain , or portugal . 
  it sets a precedent . 
  there is no need only for debt relief . 
  debt restructuring is also feasible . 
  there 's this thing called inflationary default . 
  push the debt far into the distance and inflation would cut a part of it . 
  and no one would actually * feel * it . 
  as for the precedent . 
  do you think other countries are willing to reach greek levels of destruction in order to get a debt relief ? 
  is any politician willing to push his country into 30 % loss of gdp , 30-40 % salary reduction , unemployment etc etc ( you 've heard it plenty of times ) just to get a x % debt write-off ? 
  or if another country reaches greece 's levels of a crisis do you think that the problem would be a second debt relief ? 
  if such thing happened , then the euro project has a problem . 
  it 's not * just * greece , then it 's a structural problem . 
  debt relief would n't be very high on the agenda . 
   the certainty of a grexit appears to lower bond yields for the ez countries , the markets are seeing that the euro is not being sacrificed to entertain recalcitrant members . 
  no one would want to follow in greece 's path . 
  but it might be unavoidable . 
  consider that there is such strong dissent concerning the debt relief on some of the greek debt . 
  and that 's mostly peanuts for titans like the german economy . 
  how probable would be a debt relief in a worst case scenario for a country the size of italy ? 
  not happening . 
  you are misinformed . 
  the vote had nothing to with paying the debt or not . 
  having said that here 's why greece leaving the ez might prove destructive for the other members as well : greece leaving means ez is not infallible and that if another country has similar problems , then that country could follow the same path . 
  that is problematic because uncertainty means bond yields will become larger , so countries will have more expensive loans . 
  more expensive loans means the problems will become larger . 
  larger problems means even more expensive loans and you get the point . 
  apart from that , there is the issue of defaulting . 
  greece defaulting will be painful but manageable . 
  what would happen if say italy with a $ 2.8 t - a 10x larger debt than greece - would follow the same path ? 
  italy has 130 % debt to gdp right now , greece had 120 % when the crisis blew up . 
  italy is in a way better position of course since it has an actual industry , but if we consider the previous circumstances , loans getting more and more expensive , it 's not out of the question . 
  damn , we 've been having quite a show this year . 
  all these `` personalities '' , it 's political drama + big brother + thriller + soap opera all in one . 
  it would prove an annoyance , nothing more . 
  that is not so strong to bend the will of 18 other nations . 
  that 's essentially a myth . 
  yes there is oil in greece , it 's enough to worth exploiting but by no means will it transform us into saudi arabia over night . 
  estimations put the revenue of the new oil exploitation sites at ~ [ $ 15b under 30years ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/168809/article/ekathimerini/business/greeces-energean-looks-at-offshore-tenders-amid-russia-interest ) . 
  sure it 's good pocket change , but nothing more . 
  it does n't matter . 
  and if did matter , it 's still our fault . 
  it does n't matter . 
  that is probably the only reason we still have talks . 
  her ... issue is the devil , 666 and all that good stuff . 
  i started writing a joke about sending him a check and how it would solve some problems . 
  but the situation is so volatile , people might think i actually mean it . 
  the problem i see is that tsakalotos - in contrast with varoufakis - is a party member and has been for quite a while . 
  varoufakis objections during the negotiations were economic based . 
  tsakalotos may have political objections as well though . 
  but again , tsipras seems hellbent on finding a solution , our country is just before the brink , i do n't think there 's room here for political concerns on the negotiation . 
  thanks for this .
