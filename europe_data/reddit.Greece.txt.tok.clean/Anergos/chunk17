  pretty interesting . 
  we 're almost tied with germany for the more posts , would n't have believed it . 
  especially if you consider the population sizes . 
  though the people from the none country trumps us all  . 
  well , * some say * that they approached clarkson to return to the show , at one point at least . 
   as for the prices , with fewer goods the prices go up . 
  that 's supply and demand . 
  yeah but with greece , people starting buying * less * goods . 
  not more . 
  prices should have fallen , not risen . 
   for the prices to go down , the production costs would have to go down . 
  have they actually gone down ? 
  of greek goods ? 
  of course . 
  with wages fallen as much as 30-40 % of course the production costs went down . 
  prices did n't . 
  as for the why , i do n't know . 
  funding became more expensive ? 
  exporting was more lucrative than supplying the local market ? 
  i ca n't tell . 
   i 'm just saying , numbeo is a good way to get a very rough impression , but you should n't base any serious decisions on that kind of self-selected data . 
  yeah , i gave it as a means of actually gauging the cpi . 
  plus , we 're not here to make life altering decisions . 
  we 're simply talking . 
  the problem is that prices are not adjusting accordingly . 
  you see the shift of gdp per capita but you do n't see the prices following that trend . 
  quite the opposite : [ consumer price index for greece . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rcqfshb.jpg ) so you had a ~ 30 % reduction in gdp/capita with an ~ 8 % increase in price of goods . 
   greek standard of living now is what it should have been with normal growth . 
  as i said , it 's misleading . 
  you want something to compare ? 
  greece and portugal have roughly the same gdp/capita . 
  around $ 21k . 
  so they should have the same cost of living , right ? 
  [ greece ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_result.jsp?country=greece ) vs [ portugal ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_result.jsp?country=portugal ) . 
  because they could n't get the consensus of all the parties before the referendum was over . 
  they did n't know what the result would be etc. 
  plus there were shifts after the result that no-one could really anticipate . 
  head of the opposition party resigned etc etc. 
  the situation is pretty volatile , no one can plan ahead . 
   yes , you want the debt to magically disappear , do n't you ? 
  where exactly did i claim that ? 
  i 'm really curious as to what you 'll answer - if anything - next . 
   yes , you want the debt to magically disappear , do n't you ? 
  that 's why you 're whining about the grandchildren , because you 're not a man enough to pay the debt you got yourself into . 
  and you 're telling me about my behavior ? 
  did i treat you with anything but respect on my comments ? 
  did i insult you , call you `` not man enough '' as you 're doing ? 
   why did greece do nothing today ? 
  all the major political parties convened today for 8 hours . 
  tsipras invited everyone ( well most everyone , the communists and golden dawn did n't come ) and sat on the table in order to reach a common consensus on what an agreeable solution would be ( so as when they bring a proposal back home , to not find interference from the parliament ) . 
  there were phone talks with many major political figures as well . 
  plus eurogroup is to convene tuesday . 
  not much can be done in a more official capacity before then . 
  so no , i ca n't find any way that the statement `` do nothing today '' can be true . 
  [ does 40 years sound about right ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03179/greecedebtschedule_3179326c.jpg ) ? 
  financial obligations and justice are not the same thing . 
  if my father was a gambling addict and for some reason i co-signed a loan it 's my obligation to pay . 
  it 's not just , it 's a contract , and contracts have nothing to do with morality . 
  what does this have anything to do with what we 're talking about ? 
  what if everyone was to follow that brilliant piece of advise , what would happen ? 
  an entire country been extinguished from the map because of debt ? 
  and you call this `` justice '' ? 
   i hope you realize how entitled your sound and how ridiculous your behavior looks and reflects on the rest of your citizens . 
  get off your high horse already . 
  definition of entitled :  believing oneself to be inherently deserving of privileges or special treatment . 
  did at any point mention i deserve more ? 
  did at any point said i am deemed special treatment ? 
  spewing stereotypical nonsense reflects bad on ** your ** behavior not mine . 
  many factors . 
  greece 's industry is service based . 
  many people are self employed . 
  that 's the group of that tax evades most in any country and we happen to have a lot of them . 
  that 's due to how * easy * it is to do undeclared work . 
  our tax system is a joke and it 's corrupt to the bone . 
  well , no surprises here . 
  social reasons . 
  all and when i mean all , i mean all our past governments were involved in one scandal or another . 
  when you have such a low opinion of the government , it 's less likely to be upfront on your taxes . 
  geographical location . 
  apart from geopolitical reasons , smuggling is easy . 
  and many more . 
  justice ? 
  do you think it 's just for my children 's children to be burdened by what my father voted for ? 
  justice has nothing to do with economics . 
  say that you do n't want to pay another cent for us . 
  that 's acceptable and that 's your prerogative . 
  do n't try to dress it up as justice or morals . 
  the lady is a known woman with mental problems . 
  just for those people who are wondering ( someone came to / r/greece and asked about it ) she 's shouting `` orthodox people '' ( as in orthodox christians ) . 
  nothing really to see . 
  first of all and sorry for this , but the notion that we `` do n't have to pay '' any of the $ 84b bank is ridiculous . 
  how did you come up with this number ? 
  this looks like the ela , not the ecb bought bonds , the efsf , imf or glf loan . 
  second you need to understand where we 're coming from . 
  we 've been asked for 5 years to do changes [ which we did ] ( http://blogs-images.forbes.com/stevekeen/files/2015/02/image0011.png ) - let no one tell you we did n't - and there is nothing to show for . 
  instead of the aspects getting better , they are getting worse . 
  no one challenges the fact that we should pay , nor that harsh policies are needed . 
  but as things stand , the debt is not sustainable . 
  that 's not me or any greek minister saying it , imf and even merkel herself knew it .
