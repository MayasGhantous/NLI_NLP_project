  that 's the dudes actually doing the haircuts . 
  and there 's no reason to refute it at this point if it 's true , capital controls are in , no-one can move their accounts . 
  well , it 's better than the octopus ... 
  yeah . 
  my brain could n't handle the notion . 
  and what 's the point of the title then ... 
  i 've read it . 
  it does n't make sense . 
  at one point we have :  the choice before them on sunday was between holding on to the euro and being `` temporarily without it '' . 
  and at the other :  his remarks seemed to endorse the claims of the greek government , which has called for a no vote , to the effect that a majority in favour of rejection would not lead to the country 's exit from the euro ( `` grexit '' ) . 
  how can no lead to a temporary exit and no not leading to a grexit at the same time ? 
  do you thing of us all 30y old or younger with no families and no serious ties to our community to be able to pack up our things and leave ? 
  are you looking only from the perspective of a 24y old with no family and enough cash to be able to migrate ? 
  because news for you , those people already left . 
  2 % of the population migrated already these past few years , the young and educated left en mass . 
   german finance minister , wolfgang sch\u00e4uble , appears to back no vote ** what ? 
  ** -- how ... why ... wait ... unhandled exception at 0x00435917 in brain.exe 0xc000000fd : stack overflow . 
  are you serious now ? 
  your calling us lazy because ... we did n't pack our things and leave ? 
  i am beyond words ... 
  it is true though . 
  my local supermarket was out of honey nut cheerios today . 
  they dared to ask me to wait till monday for the resupply . 
  i had to resort to crunchy honey nut kellogs instead . 
  horror i tell you ... resorting to kellogs ... what kind of third world country does not have honey nut cheerios in stock ? 
  fucking tsipras should have driven the cheerios van himself ... on a more serious note , this is nothing new . 
  misinformation and horror tactics are been applied even in the greek media . 
  i do n't think there is any publication from the big ones ( bbc , guardian , ft etc ) that has not faltered in a big way at least once . 
  it used to be , you could quote such publication as a source for a fact , now ... well , not so much . 
   90 % of that money went to the creditors because greece borrowed that money from the creditors before and spent it . 
  does really nobody understand this ? 
  is it the same with saying  money regardless what they do with it ? 
  the point i was making was that the `` money '' was not ours to do what we wanted . 
  and no the interest is not `` basically '' 0 % . 
  0 % is only the bonds the ecb bought ( ~ 20b ) and that assuming they 'll eventually return the gains to greece . 
  [ 3.6 % ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=imf+interest+rate+greece&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8 ) . 
  efsf ? 
  by comparison imf gets their money for 0.9 % . 
  average rate for most eu countries ( germany et.al ) ? 
  you 'll need to understand some errors in your assumption . 
  the `` money '' is not `` ours '' to do what we want with . 
  they have a pretty specific role and that role is not within our purview to change . 
  thus far 90 % of that money went to the creditors directly from the ecb et.al . 
  and the rest had pretty specific targets of where they would be assimilated . 
  so strike the `` regardless of what we do with it '' remark . 
  as for the `` deserving '' part , yeah , no comment . 
  i 'll quote you on that next time someone points out the morality of not paying a loan . 
  yeah . 
  let 's punish them . 
  there are no hard stats for tax evasion . 
  only estimates . 
  greek shadow economy was [ ~ 25 % of gdp ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21623742-getting-greeks-pay-more-tax-not-just-hard-risky-treasures ) . 
  of course people would equate that to 25 % of greek people tax evading . 
  which is of course stupid . 
  a doctor tax evading equals to 10 undeclared minimum wage workers . 
  a person importing `` tax free '' cigarettes equals to 50 doctors . 
  and so on . 
  i was being sarcastic . 
  oh , sorry about that . 
  i misread . 
  let me correct my previous comment . 
  ** edit : i could say that ** saying that newspaper articles can be dehumanizing and in the same paragraph saying it 's the old person 's fault for him being in that situation is really something . 
  ** edit : i could say that ** i 'm glad you * really * did n't want to feel better about yourself with claiming bullshit statistics made from thin air . 
  ** edit : but i am not . 
  right ? 
  the official stats point to 49.995 % . 
  we do n't want to imply that * most * of the greeks tax evaded . 
  nooo , that would fall under the stereotypes . 
  it 's official stats mind you . 
  with sources . 
  from the internets . 
  where exactly do you expect to see conversations about past mistakes ? 
  here ? 
  on your telly ? 
  why do you think syriza came to power ? 
  because we were content with how things were ? 
  why do you think they still have popular support even though they get bashed constantly by foreign and domestic media alike ? 
  even though they 're amateurs ? 
  i really do n't understand the eu sentiment about this . 
  on the one hand , you hold responsible the greek people for the people they vote for . 
  and i agree . 
  but on the other hand , you 'd be glad when tsipras the `` radical '' element gets overthrown . 
  our only real alternative from the same people that brought us into this situation and your leaders are doing everything in their power to bring him down . 
  it does n't make sense . 
  greece you fucked up voting for those corrupt people for so many years . 
  now , go back to voting for those corrupt people again ... 
  the only extreme thing in this party is in their party title . 
  did their suggested measures seam extremist of leftist to you ? 
  shit , i have never in my life seen so blatant propaganda in our media . 
  it 's so much so that the only semi-balanced view from a tv station ( our national tv ) seems heavily pro no by comparison . 
  and so much money thrown into it . 
  i 've seen more adds advocating the yes in youtube than pre-election party campaigns during january . 
  which is saying something . 
  ** athens | greece ** ~ 30c , obviously lower in the shadows . 
  nothing to complain about , really . 
  weather is fine . 
  i can tell from my house as well , no need for my trusty fan yet ( no a/c is available ) and my computer [ agrees ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yt4dlr5.jpg ), 
   do you want big countries bullying the small ones ? 
  you welcome that ? 
  what a fucked up world we live in .
