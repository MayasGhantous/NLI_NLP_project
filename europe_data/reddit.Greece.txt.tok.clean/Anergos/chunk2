  what do you see ? 
  the italian and the green study the photograph carefully , and responded : two cables !, 
  exactly , do you know what that means ? 
  asked the egyptian . 
  no , the others replied . 
  it means that the ancient egyptians had invented the telephone !, 
  unimpressed the greek reaches for his bag , and produces a photograph of his own . 
  wait till you see this , he claimed . 
  this was found below the parthenon . 
  what do you see ? 
  the italian and the egyptian studied the photograph long and hard . 
  they brought it to the light , they stuck their faces on the photograph , used a magnifying glass ... after a while they responded resigned : nothing , we see nothing '' . 
  exactly , shouted the greek . 
  do you know what that means ? 
  the italian and the egyptian looked at each other and replied in unison ... no . 
  it means that the ancient greeks had invented the cellphone !, 
  wanted to order something from czech , item cost $ 45 , shipping cost $ 35 . 
  shipping costs for the same item from czech to portugal was $ 6.5 , even though it 's almost double the distance . 
  it has to do with the laws and how costly it is for the logistics/mail companies to do business . 
  european stores do n't use their country 's national post for various reasons . 
  chinese / korean stores however do , and it 's very cheap , especially for small sized stuff . 
  ebay and amazon is okey-ish , as vendors use the cheapest available postage . 
  online shops however who use dhl , fedex etc , it 's cost prohibitive . 
  make the declaration of boats over a specific size mandatory . 
  force the naval yards to implement a registration number on the hull of the vessel similar to the vin on a car . 
  give incentives to other countries ( turkey / libya etc ) to adopt said laws . 
  institute harsher laws against people who profit from transporting refugees and treat them as human smugglers . 
  create a pan-european immigration police ( think interpol but for immigration ) to handle those matters . 
  give incentives to other countries ( turkey / libya etc ) to adopt said laws . 
  appoint vessels from all countries on patrol duties on high traffic areas ( southern med/easter aegean etc ) . 
  that always in conjunction with the country who 's national waters they will be operating on . 
  create refugee receiving centers ( / w humane conditions ) in key positions with easily accessible and cheap transportation to and from eu countries and deportation countries . 
  4-5 c130 can do the job . 
  said key positions need not only be on european soil but friendly to eu countries near/on the immigration path/countries of origin . 
  in aforementioned centers create an `` adjustment '' agency . 
  make a mandatory 1 month duration program , which will be used to screen immigrants in order to better assign them to places of settlement and to weed out trouble elements . 
  give incentives to immigrants to have some form of identification and to voluntarily go to said centers . 
  spread that information to countries of origin . 
  converge the immigration benefits on all eu countries as much as possible and always taking into account the cost of living on each country . 
  make countries no more or less desirable as targets of immigration unless there is actual need for it . 
  accrue diplomatic - and not military - power on troubled regions to help form a solution . 
  put the intelligence services to good use for once . 
  embargo the weapon and ammunition sales on troubled regions . 
  education is the key . 
  educated people are less prone to sectarianism . 
  ----- so 3-prong solution to all three facets of the problem . 
  solve the cause of the problem , stop the means that facilitate the problem and fight the after effects . 
  the investigations are not handled by judges , but by prosecutors . 
  she is a judge of the high court of greece . 
  their duty is to examine and cancel if need be decisions on issues made by lesser courts as it pertains to the current legislation . 
  they do not handle `` corruption cases '' . 
  you do n't need to act as a temporary pm to color your opinion or make friends with politicians . 
  the door is that way - , 
  [ the music ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkgta30tzn8 ) man ... goosebumps . 
  +1 for the movie as well . 
   i fucking love dakos , though i go with mizitra over feta . 
  yeah , preference thing really . 
  i like mizithra as well , but for mixing it with other foods/recipes , i prefer feta . 
  mizithra is more of a [ stand-alone cheese ] ( http://www.bwdavis.ca/uploads/2/9/3/4/2934170/8479627_orig.jpg?80 ) for me . 
  i 'm from crete and we make our own olive oil . 
  we consume a lot of the stuff , we have a [ 150lt tote ] ( http://www.olillopart.cat/wp-content/uploads/ibc-oliveoil1.jpg ) under a staircase which we refill every year . 
  one year our trees needed trimming or what-it 's - called so the crop was minimal , and due to some miscommunication we run out of oil for a month . 
  well , you know the saying about taking stuff for granted . 
  we used store bought for a couple of days . . yeah , we resorted to ordering from outside . 
  example : we have a snack , [ barley rusk + tomatoes + feta + oregano ] ( https://greekaura.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/dakos.jpg ) and as with all our dishes , olive oil ( if you can find the [ rusk ] ( http://www.veterano.gr/portals/0/templates/rusk1.jpg ) - the rest are pretty easy , ** try it ** , you 'll thank me ) . 
  typically we drown that stuff in olive oil and it 's delicious . 
  it 's not cloying , you do n't feel satiated by the oil . 
  well , with ** our ** oil that is . 
  with the store bought , even with way less that we were used to , we could n't eat the thing . 
  after a couple of bites we felt `` full '' . 
  and never mind the smell . 
  ----- anyway , if you 're really interested in the culinary arts or you simply enjoy using olive oil in your dishes , i suggest finding a couple of friends and making a `` mass '' order from a local . 
  how much do you pay for your olive oil ? 
  $ 10 for that shitty little .5 lt container ? 
  you can get it for $ 3-5 straight from the source . 
  a parcel of 50x50x50 and 100kg would cost around $ 250 shipment , so you 'll get aaa oil for less than half . 
  taboos are societal structures . 
  natives in various parts of the world that do not have such prohibitions grow up just fine . 
  how many years ago was it that women could n't even bathe using anything other than full coveralls ? 
  it 's just customs . 
  some get discarded while new ones get adopted . 
  nah , we do call it ornithorhynchos ( chicken/bird-beak ) as well , but platypodas is more widely used as it 's easier to spell . 
  plus it 's a funnier and cutter name . 
  the known dude 's beard ( last image ) is more well kept that the model you 're referring too . 
  while at the same time being more curly thus harder to keep . 
  $ 85 billion bro . 
  ca n't be more pro than that . 
  greece , the others are amateurs where debt is concerned . 
  there 's so much stuff going on in europe presently , that i have n't bothered getting myself informed with what 's happening in the other side of the atlantic . 
  so , i am ashamed to say , i have no knowledge of sanders nor what is happening with the nominations of the parties there . 
  well , the definition of `` informed '' is pretty ... subjective . 
  i can accept that not all ( or not even most ) advocates of a grexit are bild readers , but how many of them have an actual understanding of the situation ? 
  how can you even measure that ? 
  our flag has a white cross on blue on the top left , representing orthodoxy . 
  it has 9 stripes , 5 blue 4 white alternating . 
  the number of stripes represent the saying '' ** freedom or death ** '' , with the 5 blue stripes representing the number of syllables in the word `` freedom '' , the 4 white the number of syllables in `` or death '' ( obviously in the greek language ) . 
  the history of the color selection is pretty muddy , goes from the simple `` resembles the sea and sky '' to the color of achilles ' shield . 
  well mussolini 's army had tanks and our most modern aircraft - the pzl p. 24 was no match in most parts for the italian g. 50s and mc .200 . 
  plus we did n't have any bombers . 
  strategy was not our saving grace either - as it was later proved that leaving our bulgarian borders mostly unguarded allowed germany to speedily invade without much resistance .
