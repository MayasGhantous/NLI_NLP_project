  well , coming from a country who 's pm and a hundred or so other relevant people were tapped on the greatest wiretapping scandal of the country , and the only thing we have to show for is a slap on the wrist to vodafone ... 
  i do n't think there 's much we could do . 
  ** god dammit v-man . 
  ** you make great sense on some days . 
  and you go and spoil it on other days . 
  i like you . 
  i like your opinions and that makes it harder because i need to judge you harsher because of that . 
  you 're like two-face dent . 
  god dammit . 
  well , not exactly confronts but anyway . 
  the dude did really look like he was going to explode though . 
  and no commends on the good-will gesture from the girl ? 
  i mean , she did give him 1/60th of her allotted money for the day . 
  hey , capital inflow ... ... right ? 
  i doubt he 's a greek or if he is one , he 's very used to writing in english . 
  you see , we do n't really put the accent over the `` i '' ( ours is '' \u03b9 '' ) and all the accents in our grammar have specific purpose . 
  what he is talking about is that most of the fiscal measures been required from the greek side hurt the weakest members of the greek economy , low waged people and small pensioners . 
  the mood can change if , during monday and a no , you 'll suddenly see huge effects in the markets and pressure been applied to the weaker eu countries . 
  i am not saying that is going to happen , but i would n't exclude it . 
  well , they need to be reminded of that fact , sure . 
  but not in the midst of a tough negotiation . 
  that 's where diplomacy comes into play . 
  when you advocate a solution , and brand that solution a win for you but loss from the other team , that solution even if it 's the right one wo n't be adopted . 
  brand the same solution as a cooperative effort or even a loss for you then see how it plays out . 
  the other side would be more willing to accept a solution beneficial to you if they seem they did n't conceded that much . 
  you see the actual content of the negotiations - at least in the beginning - did n't matter . 
  common people would n't understand the difference between say 1 % of gdp worth of fiscal measures and imposing restrictions to early retirement . 
  brand the second measures tougher than the first and suddenly you have a realistically milder package for the greek side and at the same time a harsher package on paper for the creditor side . 
  i only did the translation . 
  the creators name is featured in the translated image as well , no wish to steal credit . 
   first , if you only want to hear your opinion stop posting . 
  start blogging . 
  i am pretty open to reasonable arguments from both sides . 
  i am here for debate and information , not to garner support for specific political ideas , ideologies or push for specific agendas . 
  as far as my argument being absurd , name me one thing that pushed more people to the yes vote than the banks closing . 
  explain to me why tsipras has asked not once , but twice to remove the cap on ela , even if that meant accepting most of the previous `` unacceptable '' terms . 
  the answer is simple . 
  he is a joke , an amateur . 
  but he 's not the evil mastermind that wants greece out of the euro you 're portraying him to be . 
  as far as the vile attacks you are right , i have indeed taken it more personally that i should have and i apologize . 
  however you need to know that what you are doing is detrimental to the actual cause you so furiously champion and to the whole discussion in general . 
  one can not have a balanced view if waves upon waves of information presented is distorted in order to suit another one 's political views . 
  ** best case scenario : ** re-enter negotiations , get a deal with better terms . 
  terms which include some form of debt restructuring and reforms that might be enough to put greece on the path to recovery . 
  why would the referendum change the negotiation will of the creditors ? 
  because tsipras could play all or bust since he has the support of the people . 
  creditors would have to * offer * terms acceptable by tsipras , since he has the ok to not accept without political cost . 
  they do n't . 
  ** worst case scenario : ** re-enter negotiations . 
  same or worse terms than before due to how the situation has developed . 
  tsipras does not accept . 
  ela is not restored , greece issues new currency to deal with the liquidity problem , removes herself from ez , inflation to a great degree , medication and other imports not happening due to the volatility of the new currency . 
  black market based on the existing euros - loss of income due to taxes lost from that shadow market , exacerbates the fiscal problem etc etc. 
  why would the referendum not change the negotiation will of the creditors in this case ? 
  they deemed the risk of contagion/after effects of greece leaving the ez not great compared to the political cost of offering better terms in the negotiation . 
  ---------------- it 's an auction where political power is the currency . 
  how much will not getting a deal cost tsipras and how much the creditors . 
  this is getting tiring and i do n't know why i bother answering you . 
  i will try however . 
  the banks closing was not good for tsipras and syriza . 
  it 's probably the only thing that makes this referendum even a race . 
  suggesting that it was a ploy from syriza is not only unreasonable but stupid . 
  if capital controls were not imposed , if banks were to remain open and ela was extended again , it would be life as usual for us greeks . 
  but having a little taste of what might be possible under a vote for no in the referendum , tipped a lot of people to the yes side . 
  so instead of making baseless propaganda and trying to spin every situation your way , stick to the actual facts . 
  there are plenty of reasons to campaign for a yes , you do n't need to invent more . 
  because the alternative is worse . 
  if i were to present to you with two options . 
  continue on a known path which will be harsh , mathematically proven that * can not * improve your situation but you will have somewhat of a guarantee of things not * really * going to hell . 
  continue on an unproven path , which will be harsh and probably things will really go to hell but ... there 's a slight , just slight chance of things getting better . 
  well it would depend on the situation which option is the more logical . 
  the turning point from option 1 to option 2 would be when your current situation does n't differ that much from the even worse situation that is probable in option 2 . 
  well , right now i am debating whether i have that much to lose . 
  ** i 'll try to present the other side of the argument to the best of my ability . 
  i will disclose that i am leaning to `` no '' but it 's by very very little . 
  ** -- first of all , the call for the referendum came to late . 
  a referendum of such importance needs time . 
  time to be organized correctly and time to make the contents accessible and understood by all the voters . 
  second , it 's ambiguous . 
  we are basically voting for an expired offer . 
  that offer is not on the table anymore and the circumstances have changed that much , that i doubt it will be available to any form closely resembling the one that we will vote for . 
  third , some times people ca n't make the best choice for themselves . 
  they either do n't have the clear of mind or background knowledge needed to make an informed decision . 
  fourth , it polarizes the greek society in a point where we need to be united and strong . 
  lastly , while deemed heroic and a last stand by many , the fact is , the referendum is burning bridges . 
  bridges we need to cross if we hope to come out of this crisis any time soon . 
  because the referendum announcement would trigger bank runs . 
  during that monday and tuesday if the banks were open and capital controls not enforced , they would have collapsed . 
  apart from the financial requirements to make such a move , i have dependents here . 
  how does your fact contradict mine ? 
  greek banks were recapitalized with a $ 50b loan due to the write-downs . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.bankofgreece.gr/pages/en/bank/news/pressreleases/dispitem.aspx?filter_by=dt&amp;item_id=4132&amp;list_id=1af869f3-57fb-4de6-b9ae-bdfd83c66c95 ) is the press release from the bank of greece if you do n't take my word for it or you 're bored to google . 
  diplomacy and common sense . 
  no one likes to be told they 're wrong . 
  especially politicians and in public . 
  nobody likes to be lectured . 
  you ca n't go changing stuff by promoting yourself as the only vehicle of that change . 
  he constantly talks about needing to work together but at the same time he alienates those people that he needs to work with . 
  though to be more exact , he alienates himself . 
  soddy translated version by me .
