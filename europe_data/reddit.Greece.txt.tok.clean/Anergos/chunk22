  he * had * to rub it in . 
  dammit . 
  thanks for the update , 
  according to the cia factbook , 1.72 % during 2012 . undata claims it was closer to 2.4 % during that time . 
   greece should not make cuts in its defence spending and had played an important role in southern europe as a nato member , nato secretary-general jens stoltenberg told a german television station on tuesday . 
   asked whether greece would remain a member of nato if it left the euro zone , he was quoted by german public broadcaster zdf as saying in a statement : `` the greek government has always stressed it wants to remain a reliable member of nato . '', 
   stoltenberg said he expected greece to continue spending 2 percent of its gross domestic product ( gdp ) on defence . 
  -- sorry my ~ ~ american ~ ~ norwegian friend but i do n't think this is happening . 
  2 % of gdp was way beyond our means for some time now . 
  every comment made by that account both here and in / r/greece is about that . 
  posting pictures of atm runs , the yes rally , anti-syriza stuff etc. 
  i do n't mind half that stuff but it gets tiring after a while . 
  i mean have the modesty of keeping appearances ffs . 
  this is not true . 
  * countries * ( ez governments ) gave bilateral loans of 52.9 billion euros during the greek loan facility ( first bailout loan of 2010 ) . 
  this debt is serviced typically and countries get their dues . 
  the euro zone 's financial rescue fund or efsf as it is called now loaned 141.8 billion euros . 
  it consists of contributions from all ez members . 
  this loan is also serviced typically . 
  imf loaned 48.1 billion euros at slightly above market prices ( 3.5 % ) with the premise of a return of 16billion euros if the project was completed successfully in 2016 . 
  guess who 's not going to see a penny . 
  the ecb holds ~ $ 20b in greek bonds . 
  all gains from said bonds are to be returned to greece if they meet their obligations on the program . 
  that 's what you are talking about , that 's what the $ 1.9 b the ecb holds right now and tsipras pissed it off in the air by his shenanigans . 
  ** no ** * assuming positive outcome * tsipras gets a negotiating chip . 
  new negotiations take place . 
  greece gets better deal . 
  all is right as rain . 
  * assuming positive outcome 2 * new negotiations unfruitful . 
  greece defaults . 
  probably creates new currency . 
  leaves ez . 
  inflation/hardship for a couple of years . 
  gets back on track . 
  sets `` bad '' precedent , other countries get ideas about leaving ez . 
  assuming negative outcome new negotiations unfruitful . 
  greece defaults . 
  probably creates new currency . 
  leaves ez . 
  inflation/dark times for many many years for the greek people . 
  market pressures on other weak countries , lots of damage but they manage . 
  assuming negative outcome 2 same as negative outcome 1 , but market pressures on other weak countries make loans unbearable . 
  eu firewalls do n't hold . 
  contagion . 
  hell breaks loose on eu banks . 
  ** yes . 
  ** assuming positive outcome tsipras either resigns or adheres to the old negotiations ( albeit with harder terms this time ) . 
  greece gets a deal . 
  greece continues to the `` path of recovery '' . 
  nothing really changes for rest of eu . 
  assuming negative outcome same as positive outcome but instead of greece continuing to the `` path of recovery '' , it gets into the same position it is now in a couple of years . 
  repeat . 
  it ca n't happen . 
  is greece capable of going two years without external financing if there are no loan repayments ? 
  sure . 
  i mean , we have n't received a trench from august last year and we 're closed to the markets so we 're essentially on our own since then . 
  plus we payed some debt that matured during that time . 
  but spending two years without market access would limit growth . 
  i mean , that 's the whole point of loans ( well the normal kind , not those * we * are taking ) , investing in the economy and getting larger returns in the form of growth vs the interest paid . 
  with no loans available growth will be pretty limited , wo n't do much in just two years time . 
  edit : i assume you 're talking that after those 2 years greece would continue to service their debt normally . 
  renzi is talking about the current proposals . 
   the point is that greece ** can ** obtain different conditions but must respect the rules . 
  otherwise there is no more community . 
  we have done a pension reform , but we did n't remove baby pension from italians to let the greeks have them , eh !, 
  not that i am arguing with you - it should have been dealt with ages ago . 
   that 's if it has n't descended into anarchy . 
  we already have . 
  today i witnessed someone drinking frappe ... ... without a * straw * . 
  luckily a replacement straw was found and crisis was averted just in time . 
  yeah there are some ... discrepancies but most of them are correct enough to prove a point . 
  sure . 
  let 's take then the 1935-1950 period then as well . 
  hungary , austria , germany , poland , russia , turkey , china , japan defaulted . 
  greece did not . 
  plus argentina defaulted after the inception of the euro . 
  it was n't the first country . 
  the problem with defining a - insert year - for gauging economic performance is that it does n't take into account the individual circumstances . 
  it 's * unfair . 
  * how can you specify a date when it does n't hold the same significance for * all * countries . 
  or that date is n't even the same for all countries . 
  i mean sure , the official surrender happened mostly during that year , but fighting in europe stopped closer to 1950 's . 
  the us occupation of japan ended at 1952 . 
  wwi was n't significant ? 
  the inception of the euro was n't significant ? 
  the advent of internet was n't significant ? 
  industrial revolution was n't significant ? 
  should we consider only the time after wwii ? 
  from which year exactly ? 
  should we say after the official end of wwii ? 
  5 years after the war ? 
  10 years after the war ? 
  what is the `` acceptable '' timeline for you ? 
  i opted not to put any more strain in the banking system . 
  it was not exactly faith , but doing an action for fear of a event when that action increases that event 's probability of happening seemed like fallacy to me . 
  what little i still have would not help me in the event of a revert to drachma anyway . 
  what , are we taking arbitrary time intervals now as a gauge ? 
  why after wwii ? 
  why not after wwi ? 
  why not during the 20th century ?
