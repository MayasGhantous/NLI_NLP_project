  why not during the last 5 months ? 
  why not just today ? 
  i can choose time that suits my point of view as well you know . 
   just checked and afghanistan under the taliban and zimwabwe are examples of defaulted countries ** true . 
  they are examples of defaulted countries .

  yeah those damn greeks . 
  if only ** every single proposal ** made by both greece and the creditors included amendments to restrict early retirement ... ... oh wait, 
   a lot of things that have been put in writing in 2012 and are the basis of the current `` bailout '' have not been implemented . 
  feel free to prove me wrong , but the only thing to my knowledge that greece failed to meet , were the projections . 
  all the second bailout terms concerning cuts etc were applied . 
  that 's why there 's this disbelief in the troika 's program . 
  plus you can look around , greece had the best reform rating among all nations in the eu the past 5 years . 
   debt restructuring would be part of the next round of talks . 
  you need to understand that debt restructuring and whatever reforms/measures are needed in order for greece to get back on track are inter-dependent on each other . 
  if the measures accepted today are inadequate without some form of debt restructuring , what 's the point of applying them ? 
  the proposed measures should take into account the changes in the debt structure . 
  in other words debt restructuring is not an incentive . 
  but part of the changes needed . 
  just so that people do n't get confused like i did . 
  $ 8.50 is the hourly wage . 
  not daily . 
  it is the same published on sunday by the eu executives . 
  it 's not new - though for obvious reasons it 's branded as such . 
   under juncker 's offer , tsipras would have to send a written acceptance by tuesday of the terms published by the eu executive on sunday and agree to campaign in favour of the bailout in the planned july 5 referendum . ', 
  the * possibility * of debt relief is not the same as a * guarantee * of a debt relief . 
  that 's double speak for `` we shall see '' . 
  it 's also double standards . 
  why do they expect the greek govt to put everything in writing ( remember the start of the negotiations ? ), 
  but on their end a promise for consideration of debt relief - not even a guarantee - from a serial liar should be enough ? 
  there 's - probably - nothing to it . 
  ca n't be 100 % sure of course , but the `` sources '' are the big greek media . 
  the govt has stated the rejection of junckers latest proposal and have issued a non-paper for the clear response of the greek government . 
  ft reached out to an `` unnamed '' government official who stated u-turns are not under consideration . 
  as it stands , it looks like those reports come from the `` big media '' in greece . 
  you know the same media that tried to incite further bank-runs with the report that atm withdrawals will be limited to $ 20 . 
  another newspaper claimed that there were no $ 20 bills in the atms but following the next day atms would dispense only $ 20 bills ( 0 sense ) . 
  anyway , the govt has stated the rejection of junckers latest proposal and have issued a non-paper for the clear response of the greek government . 
  ** tsipras to back down and accept juncker proposal . 
  ** the pm and government are considering backing out from the `` no '' in yesterday evening 's juncker proposal . 
  the pressure that has been accumulating and the conditions of asphyxiation in the market from closing the banks , in conjunction with the repercussions of the greek program expiration at midnight , but also the pressures from government and party officials that internally for the time being are keeping their distances in regards to the referendum , are leading to a change of position . 
  according to information , the government has already send word to brussels that they are doing a fresh re-evaluation of the commission 's president 's final proposal that includes - among others - debt adjustment in octomber and changes in the ekas . 
  -- though the machine translation did n't do a half - bad job but anyway . 
  do you prefer `` chairman of the council of economic advisers '' and `` senior economic policy adviser during the 2008 obama presidential campaign '' previous to that ? 
  how about professor at the university of chicago 's booth school of business ? 
  one would think that those references ought to be enough to not be a `` self-proclaimed '' expert . 
  but i guess having a single lawyer degree makes you viable to be [ head of the negotiations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean-claude_juncker ) but a b.a. 
  in economics from yale university and a ph.d. in economics from mit is not enough for a phone interview with the washington post about the matter . 
  yeah . 
  bad varoufakis . 
  you dare have * fun * ? 
  are you smiling ? 
  do n't you feel for your people ? 
  if you want to say something bad about v-man , you should say that the dude claimed 1h before the capital controls were enacted that no capital controls would be enacted . 
  but a picture of him greeting a colleague in a heartfelt way is not demeaning in the least . 
   deeply recommend you never open this subject with an older romanian . 
  ever . 
  an older romanian would never equate the situation in greece with communism . 
  that 's exactly what * you * did . 
  i do not agree with a referendum at this point . 
  however : 1 . 
  it 's ** not ** the dictionary definition of loaded question . 
  a loaded question contains an unjustified or controversial assumption that the recipient is forced to accept . 
  have you stopped taking drugs ? 
  the loaded question here is that you assume the question recipient has taken drugs in the past and any reply in the yes/no form means the recipient accepting that assumption . 
  that did n't stop them a couple years back from signing the documents though . 
  remember the `` we signed a document that no-one read '' ? 
  the premise of the referendum is this : accept hard measures and do n't risk anything or go for broke ? 
  that 's what the referendum is . 
  i wo n't argue about that . 
  though for obvious reasons time is a commodity we ca n't afford . 
  there will be no court action . 
  it 's just a `` legal '' retort to those claiming that the ez members can kick out greece if a no is voted at the referendum . 
  it 's psychobabble or legalbabble or whatever you want to call it . 
   your questions are ridiculous because whatever greece does next affects me directly in quite a major way do you get a say-so in the german elections ? 
  do n't they affect the euro in quite a major way ? 
  do you get a say-so in the us elections ? 
  do n't they affect the euro in quite a major way ? 
  just because you 've invested in greek banks does not mean you have a right to have a say-so in what happens here . 
  if that were the case then we might as well put up a german and french flag on the acropolis since we owe them around $ 150b . 
  if you were 35 + y old you would probably know what a communist regime looks like . 
  you would n't be spewing nonsense like '' western europe does n't know how communists work . '', 
  because obviously , you do n't . 
  having a leftist government does not a communist government make . 
  go ask your grandparents about communism , read ( or come and visit ) greece * then * tell me if * anything * is remotely similar to your stalinist romania of the 50 's or even ceausescu 's regime in the 70 's . 
  as for the `` war '' , the proposition is ridiculous at best . 
  what , do you expect that a reasonable reaction towards an `` irrational government '' would be to send tanks ? 
  really ? 
  why the fuck do you care if we organize a referendum or not ? 
  why the fuck do you care if that referendum is rational or not ? 
  this is getting fucking ridiculous , yeah we owe people a shit ton of money i get it , but that does n't give you the fucking right to object on what * should * be a democratic procedure of a sovereign nation . 
  what , are you a fucking lawyer now , expert in international affairs ? 
  if they ( we ) think we have legal grounds , let them ( us ) have our day in court . 
  what the fuck are you afraid of ? 
  if it 's hallucinatory or has absolutely no relation with reality it will be thrown off the court . 
  if not , then hurrah for us . 
  as for the rest of your bullshit post , yeah we 're communists pro russian country ready to start wwiii and overprint euros to pay our loans . 
  i like how in the same article the rumor is denied by the ministry of finance . 
  `` the ministry of finance denies information that came to light that the limit of daily transactions from atms will be reduced from 60 to 20 euros . '', 
  yet they still post it .
