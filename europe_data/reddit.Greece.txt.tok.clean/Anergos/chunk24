  btw , you need to remember who we 're talking about here . 
  here is his direct quote : * `` when the going gets tough , you have to lie . 
  '' * the man is not to be trusted in the least . 
  but we 're not talking about what the greek govt was fine with or not . 
  junker claimed his proposal did n't have any pension cutting period . 
  not that his proposal did n't feature any more cutting than what the greek side conceded to . 
  and even if he did mean that , it 's again a lie . 
  where are we going to find the 1 % of gdp from pensions during 2016 he 's asking for ? 
  or do the increased health contributions from pensioners does n't count as a pension cut ? 
  ekas can amount up to 40 % of the low-end pensions . 
  saying that phasing it out is not cutting current pensions is like claiming hitting you with a baton is not really me hitting you , but the baton . 
  or if you prefer the eu way [ here . 
  no , that 's dog meat . 
  why do you think we stopped euthanizing dogs ? 
  or eaten alive due to the lack of food . 
  ... jesus the stupidity of some people . 
  i do n't think our other eu brothers would understand the reference . 
  no sadly . 
  that was something little i added . 
  the exact interpretation is `` small change '' , but without the `` change '' having the double meaning of both change and small coins . 
  just the small coins . 
  yeah it is . 
  you obviously need it more than we do . 
  the issue is that the `` previous '' proposal was set as an ultimatum . 
  there were no talks about the revised proposal . 
  or so our govt ( and some eu media ) claims . 
  or , you know , someone with a sense of humor . 
  ** someone is lying . 
  ** greek govt claims they did n't receive that proposal . 
  ( though the only difference is the 23  13 % vat on hotels ) creditor side claims that this was the proposal . 
  did they do the old swicheroo again ? 
  or are our esteemed leaders lying ? 
  [ atm ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nqhunit.jpg ) ** translation for our eu brothers : ** only withdrawals over $ 500 . 
  we do n't have $ 50 , $ 20 or $ 10 bills . 
  for change , ask the german embassy in the next building . 
   why were the terms agreed upon in the first place if they 're such a strain ? 
  because , and this is a direct quote believe it or not , we signed without reading the document . 
  that 's the level of incompetence and complacency our esteemed leaders had . 
  the risk was great . 
  the euro project was threatened , the pressure was immense . 
  they gave in . 
   and seem to expect foreign taxpayers money to continue to roll in . 
  again , you do n't seem to understand . 
  greece as it stands ca n't pay the whole debt . 
  we do n't want more loans - we want better terms for the loans already applied . 
  we want to be able to pay the debt . 
  we do n't need more loans as the deficit - what was causing the debt to begin with - has already been dealt with . 
  the problem exists with the existing debt . 
  as for the constant lamentation of you , the eu citizen having to bank roll us , do you think it 's what we wanted ? 
  do you think greece prefers to deal with germany and france or deutsche bank and credit agricole as their creditors ? 
  you would be in the right , if * after * your governments took on the debt , greece was not showing any will to correct the situation . 
  yes we fucked up . 
  yes our governments were on a spending spree . 
  but during all that time and till the debt nationalization , it was a tango between the greek government overspending and the banks over lending . 
  it was the decision of your governments that placed that burden on to you in order to relief the burden from your banks . 
  for a second time in two years . 
   the pension age in greece is considerably lower than most well off western countries , here in the uk its ' 65 yeah it 's considerably * lower * . 
  it 's been 67 from [ 2012 ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-20293058 ) . 
   include the failure to implement any form of coherent and effective tax policy to prevent the huge levels of tax avoidance i wo n't argue with this . 
  however you need to understand that this is a social issue . 
  it takes both time and serious reforms . 
  when you 're raising taxes while shrinking wages every year since , that does n't not help with tax avoidance . 
  you ca n't tackle an issue like than in 4-5 years in such conditions . 
  and herein lies the issue . 
  the creditor proposals thus far were fiscal adjustments only without taking into account any social aspect . 
  that 's why their `` projections '' fell that far off . 
  there was no space or time for real reforms . 
  syriza for all its faults , was right in wanting time and leniency to apply reforms . 
  and the current proposals did n't change a thing . 
  it 's just new numbers on old measures . 
  there is no space allowed for real changes . 
   blaming the imf and ecb is ridiculous , at the end of the day , and many people do n't seem to get this , these loans were given with really favourable conditions to greece , a big haircut on the loans was done , and most importantly its other european taxpayers that have footed the bill you do n't seem to understand something . 
  the ability of greece to default ( and thus negotiate ) was severely impaired by the nationalization of the debt . 
  as for the haircut , here are some fun facts : 1/3 of the restructured debt was held by greek banks who after the haircut , needed a $ 50b recapitalization loan by the greek govt and eu . 
  do you understand the stupidity of the whole situation ? 
  they did a haircut - which was great , dropped the debt/gdp by a reasonable amount - and introduced new loans as a result of it - raising the debt/gdp again ... as for the bailout , it came with strict conditions that greece followed till now . 
  here are the results ( bolded part is where the effect of the bailout can be seen ) . 
  year | debt ( $ , billions ) -- | -- 2009 | 267.5 2010 | 293.1 2011 | 303.2 2012 | 332.6 ** 2013 ** | ** 286.2 ** 2014 | 313.2 do you see the haircut having any effect ? 
  do you see from 2010 and onwards the ec/imf and ecb program having any effect ? 
  that 's why there 's some blame on the institutions . 
  5y later and a supposed 50 % bailout and we owe more that we used to , albeit with a more lenient paying plan . 
  we voted for a pro-austerity govt 4y ago . 
  see how well that went . 
  again with his rhetoric . 
  as you expect your fellow peers to respect your decision for a referendum , you should respect your peer 's decision to end the program at the expected time . 
  your call for a referendum is no more democratic than their call to not extend the program further . 
  they * still * represent the will of their people . 
  if you wanted a referendum , you should have asked for it a week prior . 
  ----- jesus v-man , i had such high hopes for you . 
  assuming the ela line will be cut off , liquidity problem is the only real issue for now . 
  but since you have cash in hand , you 'll face no problems . 
  even if you did n't have any cash , you would still be able to contact your embassy and work things out though . 
  it 's pretty shitty that this not only affects us , but our guests as well . 
  i refuse to believe that this was a display of sheer incompetence , * misunderstandings * like this have happened way too many times with big media reports on the crisis . 
  ** edit : ** * there was a translation glitch with my post , correct is as follows : * i am sure it was an honest mistake . 
  sorry for any confusion . 
  i am not debating whether there 's a chance or not of us leaving the euro . 
  i am debating whether that was a devious plan from tsipras all along to force greece out of the euro . 
  look , whatever their `` secret desires '' may be , they do n't really want greece to leave the euro . 
  greek people are pro-eu even after this whole debacle .
