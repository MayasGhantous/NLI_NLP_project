  forcing greece to leave the euro would be a political suicide . 
  some media/people are spinning this this way because they want to push for a yes in the referendum . 
  the pm said it again and again , this referendum is about the creditor proposal , leaving the euro is not negotiable/up for debate . 
   good will could be restored . 
  this will never happen . 
  apart from the fact that tsipras 's handling of the situation in my opinion has done irreparable damage to our country 's image , eu * needs * to keep the image of a bad greece/good but strict eu . 
  as far as your post : 1 is wrong . 
  plenty of countries that have tight fiscal policy still . 
  2 is wrong . 
  the crisis happened not because of countries been untrustworthy , but because of large bank liabilities . 
  i assume you 're talking about the 2008/9 and not the greek one . 
  if you 're talking about the greek one of 2010 , then which countri ** es ** exactly were deemed untrustworthy ? 
  3 is chilidish 4 is wrong . 
  plus do n't compare one country to another , they had ( and still have ) totally different issues . 
  5 is totally opinionated . 
  greece did not want `` money '' . 
  greece made at least 5 proposals filled with `` saving money '' . 
  you also imply that greece did not `` work hard '' nor suffer . 
  you also assume that we demand everything for free ( really ? ), 
  read the proposals . 
  read behind the lines , read what what happened in the eurogroup today and what happened this week in general . 
  then if you still have doubts about the criticism , i 'll be happy to show you my point of view . 
  but you should know , whatever criticism i apply to the institution 's handling of this matter , i apply worse to our government . 
   then , who the fuck could even imagine a majority government would not have a parliamentary confirmation for the most significant deal of the pm in the mandate ? 
  there were whispers about in-party fighting and rupture . 
  yeah , you 're right . 
  august ? 
  till then , so many things can happen that may change whatever suggestion we may put here . 
  i suggest ( though i ** do ** have ulterior motives , i 'm greek after all ) not to cancel and wait and see . 
  the worst thing that you can expect to face if things really go south is strikes here and there and possibly some issues with the currency . 
  riots and basically any type of social unrest will be restricted to the heavy urban centers , not corfu . 
  well , to be honest , it 's been 5y + now , so we know what to expect from a yes to the referendum . 
  the no however is an unknown quantity and no one can reasonable expect what will happen . 
  if we 're not going to be brainwashed by the media the following days , i 'd say it 's a wash , 50:50 . 
  people are reasonably fed with the current situation that they are willing to gamble ( as they did when they elected syriza ) . 
  on the other hand we really * are * pro-eu so who knows . 
  but if we judge by our history , we do n't respond well to ultimatums . 
  especially if they can be answered with a no ( [ ohi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ohi_day ) ) . 
  nah , no political party holds such power . 
  if there are going to be any `` mistakes '' , they 'll amount mostly to incompetence and hastiness . 
  that 's the same atm btw you have on your op . 
  different angle . 
  plus the reporter on sight said that they 're withdrawing $ 50 . 
  chill , they 're going for ouzo . 
   you thiefs , stop sippings of schampange , payings of debnts !, 
  fat chance . 
  wait to see the deal we made with putin for caviar . 
  first of all this is totally wrong :  because the other countries act as backers . 
  the opposite is forced by the lisbon treaty , article 125 . 
   the union shall not be liable for or assume the commitments of central governments , regional , local or other public authorities , other bodies governed by public law , or public undertakings of any member state ... . 
   they want more money for them , so it 's logical that they would lend more i am certain we had that conversation before . 
  the yields/interest rates are calculated based on the possibility of non-payment . 
  ** it 's not granted that the borrower will pay up ** or else yields would have no meaning . 
  so no , it 's not logical to lend and lend and lend since there is always the option of non payment . 
  a good bank limits its exposure to risky investments . 
  a greedy bank does not . 
   all the creditors act like creditors ( banks if you will ) if their intention was to act like creditors or banks as you say , why did they buy the debt of the real/original banks ? 
  was n't the point supposed to be to `` save '' the euro ? 
   at every point in time that greece got money lent to them by creditors they could have said no and stop the overborrowing but they did n't care , they wanted more . 
  at every point in time that the creditors lent money to greece they could have said no and stop the overlending , but they did n't care , they wanted more . 
  see ? 
  it takes two to tango . 
  you 'll notice that i did n't use male/female `` journalist '' but `` presenter '' . 
  that 's because they express an opinion - but that opinion seems pretty much reflective of what most people here in greece feel . 
  there are some pretty decent points he tries to make while others are pretty much guided by emotions and thus are bollocks . 
  the issue however is that increasing the vat from 6.5 to 23 % is a 15 % increase in our only real industry . 
  we have problems competing with turkey and our other neighbors as is . 
  increasing taxation in that front wo n't increase income but reduce competitiveness . 
  we already are having trouble due to the immigration , increasing the prices in such a difficult environment would seal our fate . 
  increasing gambling vat makes sense because it will not reduce the demand . 
  people either gamble once in a while for entertainment - increasing it wo n't make that much difference - or on a more daily basis which means that , well , they 're not too fond of quitting . 
  yeah the conspiracy thing is crap , but you have to admit that there are no reasonable explanations for what they 're suggesting . 
  it seems that they 're not looking at the big picture but just the numbers : projected income from vat increase in hotels : x monies . 
  projected income from vat increase in gambling : y monies . 
  x  y so do x. 
  that 's the thing with those negotiators . 
  they constantly underestimate the effects their proposed measures might have . 
  yeah , error on my part . 
  i 'll rectify it . 
  the municipalities have their own budget which is accrued by the various municipal taxes you pay ( mainly in the power bill ) . 
  while they do get some funds , it 's not for operational costs but for developmental reasons . 
  so no , they do n't count as public servants in the way you mean them to be - i.e. 
  their salaries do not affect the government budget balance . 
  -- a failure at the government level does not equal a failure in a municipality . 
  so when one claims that greece needs to reduce their public workers , they do n't mean the municipal appointed ones . 
  they do not reflect the shortcomings of the government , but those of the municipality . 
  the municipality may be perfectly efficient . 
  no deficits or cuts required . 
  here you go . 
  ------ ** female presenter : ** it 's an anecdote that both the finnish ( person ) and sch\u00e4uble found the creditor 's proposal very yielding . 
  ** male presenter : ** these things happen for communication reasons . 
  it 's evident that sch\u00e4uble has such an anger/fierceness towards greece that his every remark is filled with irony - not to use harsher words about the way he expresses himself about greece . 
  i find it very surprising that they moved hotels to the 23 % ( of vat scale ) , it 's obviously an attack on greek tourism ( somewhat more mild expression ) , they are trying to favor greece 's competition in the eu south and our neighbor turkey , the last also having a very low vat both in hotels and catering . 
  i have a suggestion to make to europe and the eurogroup , do n't waste time raising the vat on hotels and catering , simply issue a ban , a travel advice . 
  let them say in the open , do n't go to greece . 
  we do n't want you to buy greek medications . 
  we do n't want you to go to greek hotels . 
  we do n't want you to eat in greek restaurants . 
  we do n't want your economy to rebound . 
  why do n't they say that in open ?
