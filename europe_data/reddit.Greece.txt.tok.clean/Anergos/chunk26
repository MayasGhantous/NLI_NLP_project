  tell us in open that you 've decided for the next years that we should be bound to the debt and the troika . 
  there should n't be any kind of growth/development , there should n't be any kind of economic autonomy in this country . 
  say that it open . 
  it 's my opinion that all of this is a slow and painful death for the greek economy and that behavior is not becoming of europe . 
  that treatment has nothing to do with the europe we dreamed about during the 70 's and 80 's . 
  ** female presenter : ** and not only that nick , but the exact point you 're trying to make , the german paper s\u00fcddeutsche zeitung also makes . 
  they write today that germany is discussing about the hotels and vat while forgetting their historical responsibility towards europe . 
  ** male presenter : ** why do n't they increase the gambling vat ? 
  why do they refuse that equivalent the greek side is proposing ? 
  ** female presenter : ** they excepted the slot machines . 
  ** male presenter : ** is it because some of these countries have interests in the gambling sector in greece ? 
  also a question : what is the way that the citizens can intervene in europe anymore ? 
  do the elections play any role ? 
  does what the citizens decide during the elections play any role in this new europe ? 
  why do we bother electing governments ? 
  maybe start designating regional governors ? 
  something like this is what 's about to happen in this modern europe and it 's very depressing . 
  brother , those are the numbers that are employed in the greek state , not by the greek government . 
  it includes army personnel and regional government personnel both of which have their own separate budgets . 
  subtract 170k and you 'll reach the 300k actual public servants that everyone is talking about . 
   is this really about competition ? 
  i mean , there is a volume of demand , and they are part of the supply . 
  people are n't going suddenly to start eating olive based products . 
  however it might means prices will rise a bit . 
  tho since it 's food , the customers should be able to benefit from the lowered food-related vat so they 'll ( in practice ) loose little . 
  that 's not how it works - if i understood your meaning . 
  the distilleries buy at a fixed price regardless of where it came or how much it cost ( assuming ofc same quality ) . 
  the presses set their prices accordingly . 
  so a farmer in an island would sell his olives cheaper while costing him more . 
  would an increase in the island vat increase the price of olive oil and thus how much the olive farmers make ? 
  no , because we are competing against spain and italy , we are not competing among ourselves . 
  and even if there is a price increase , the mainland farmers will benefit * more * . 
   please remind me how much money they get from farming related subsidies ? 
  the average subsidy per acre was [ $ 39,53 across all greece ] ( http://www.emprosnet.gr/article/53651-nea-dedomena-stis-agrotikes-epidotiseis-2014 ) per annum . 
  those subsidies exist in order to guide a country to produce that thing and stop producing the other thing . 
  incentives . 
   if greece is kicked out , they loose all that too . 
  $ 1100/year in my pa 's case vs being able to plant whatever he pleases , benefiting exports from the weak new drachma ... plus if push comes to shove he still has farming land to grow his own food . 
  yeah , farmers do n't have * that * many qualms leaving the euro . 
  do n't forget the added inheritance tax . 
  it 's win-win i tell you . 
  too bad we 're relatively proficient swimmers and the waters in the aegean are not harsh . 
  i do n't know in a government level if that 's how they do it . 
  i would assume it should have been in this form : ----- ** paragraph 4 : pension reforms . 
  ** * original * effective from 31 october 2015 the authorities will phase in reforms ... * amended * effective from july 1 2015 the authorities will phase-in reforms ... ** paragraph 5 : public administration , justice and anti-corruption . 
  ** * original * the greek govt will impose harsher penal measures to tax evaders ... * amended * the greek govt will execute tax evaders ... and so on . 
  ------ btw , it 's clear an american hand put in the changes . 
  month , day , year ... we do n't roll like that here dude . 
  we 're not talking about inter-island consumption of the `` exported '' goods , as they are limited . 
  let me give you an example . 
  in x island there 's a large production of olives and olive oil . 
  it way outstrips local demand as most families make their own olive oil . 
  they sell their olives to the press , the press transports and sells it to a mainland refinery . 
  if they payed the same vat with the mainland olive growers , they would n't be able to compete . 
  plus what they `` export '' is pretty limited compared to what they `` import '' . 
  you 'll need to pay more for a toothpaste , a shampoo or an oven etc - things that are not produced there - compared to a main lander . 
  that 's why the existence of a lower vat is a necessity for islands . 
  well , if we drowned all the pensioners it would help set the budget . 
  now that i think about it , if we drowned the unemployed , the unemployment rate would tank as well . 
  plus all that drowning would create lots of jobs , reducing unemployment further . 
  priests , gravediggers , funeral homes would be needed in huge numbers . 
  and it would help with the low birth rate ( studies shown that baby making after wars / mass deaths etc ) skyrocket . 
  it would reboot the population . 
  it 's a perfectly viable solution , no wonder people did n't understand the satire . 
   so to put it simply , actually a grexit might be be good for europe you ca n't put it simply , and no , that 's not the case ( at least if you 're basing that assumption on the connection of grexit = stronger euro ) ** benefits of strong euro ** cheap money for governments . 
  lower cost for importers low inflation . 
  ** benefits of a weak euro ** increased exports . 
  benefits for multinational companies . 
  increased tourism . 
  foreign investment . 
  example : greece benefits from a strong euro . 
  they do n't export much and much of their imports come from outside eu . 
  we need constant loans ( well we borrow in euros , but since our imports/exports are tied to $ , the debt is in part tied in $ as well ) . 
  germany is the exact opposite . 
  they benefit from a weak euro . 
  -- though i would agree on the part that a grexit would be a bad thing for greece ... probably . 
   and ( iii ) eliminate discounts , including on islands  unpopular but definitely needed , i agree it 's not the issue of popularity . 
  it 's the issue of the islands being able to compete with mainland . 
  example : a farmer needs to pay 10-25c more per lt of gas in the islands compared to his peer on the mainland . 
  the island farmer also needs to pay more for the transportation of his goods . 
  the reduced vat helped maintain a level of competitiveness . 
  remove that and you remove any incentive people have to stay on the islands ( baring the obvious tourism industry ) . 
  and people say the greek govt are amateurs . 
  the others ca n't be bothered to fix the proposals to be in a semi readable form ffs . 
  they act like they 're teachers in middle school grading a test . 
  these are the people handling your billions . 
  i 'm in my thirties . 
  minced beef ( ~ 20 % fat ) + old bread ( no crumb ) + egg + onion + oregano + tad olive oil + salt/pepper + grind/stir = burger meat . 
  grill / bbq , may wash it with jd for flavor if grilled . 
  onions + balsamic vinegar + butter + tad of sugar + thyme + grill = prepared onions . 
  [ small loaf of village bread ] ( http://www.pontos-news.gr/files/psomi_152282704.jpg ) , circular incision on the top , empty the inside ( keep only the crumb ) . 
  bacon + pan + heat = prepared bacon . 
  put bread on bacon oils on pan after bacon is ready . 
  put prepared beef inside bacon infused bread + prepared bacon + tomato slices + cheddar + prepared onion + lettuce + heat ( grill/oven ) to melt cheddar . 
  bon appetit . 
  edit : forgot to say , you may want to flatten the burger ( put the complete stuff on tin foil , press it ) then put it into the oven for the final heat . 
  winter = economic crisis . 
  varoufakis = john snow . 
  he knows nothing , naive , his colleagues dismiss him , he tries to warn everybody etc. 
  tsipras is like a ** failed ** version of littlefinger .
