  and even then that depends on the type of health insurance . 
  the issue here is , that these doctors were part of the national health system . 
  that effectively meant , doctors were prescribing bayer medicine which the state pays a portion of . 
  and they did it not because it was the best course of treatment , not because the aforementioned company had deals in place with the greek state , but because they were bribed . 
   this is patently false this is realistically true . 
  any measure that affects the fiscal policy can be deemed unilateral and tank the negotiations . 
  the reinstatement of the public tv had no fiscal bearing as it will use the same funds that their predecessor ( or successor if you look at it that way ) nerit had . 
  the reinstatement of the cleaning ladies ( and some other public servants ) happened because their firing was deemed unconstitutional by the court . 
  the previous govt had fired them using an existing law on the basis of extenuating circumstances and of them not being needed . 
  the court found that the circumstances were not that `` extenuating '' since at that point , the primary budget was mostly balanced . 
  their not being needed was countered by the fact that after firing them , a private company was hired to fulfill the role of the fired servants . 
   you said it yourself : it 's the deficit that causes debt increases ... 
  egg and chicken debate , but the issue is not what causes what , but what is easier to combat at this point . 
  the greek govt now is pretty close to primary surplus . 
  that means if they ( we ) did n't have to pay interest rates on the loans , there would be no deficit . 
  that happened in just under 5 years . 
  how many years with a 4.5 % primary surplus do we need to reach sub 100-120 % debt to gdp ? 
  around 50 ? 
  and that assuming everything goes perfectly according to plan ( no lehman brothers style of crisis etc ) . 
  so i ask you again . 
  what is easier ? 
  a thing that we already have accomplished or a thing that we may accomplish in 50 years ? 
   the problems happen when a state ceases to be able to pay its own debt . 
  this is where greece has been for the past half dozen years or so that is ** not ** where greece has been for the past half dozen years or so . 
  apart from the imf payment of last week - which is still not considered a skipped payment - greece has not missed a ** single ** payment . 
   no , they are n't . 
  greece has yet to receive a single penny from bailout loans since august 2014 . 
  how did they manage to pay the maturing debt since then ? 
  and bear in mind that 2014-2015 will be the worst year concerning [ debt payments ] ( http://www.currencyfundgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/sk%c3%a4rmavbild-2015-02-20-kl.-12.47.14.png ) . 
   frankly , you got it backwards . 
  debt can easily be refinanced , managed , and rolled over . 
  to tackle deficits either you need to cut spending or increase revenue . 
  no it ca n't be easily refinanced . 
  when greece bond yields are 10 % + , t-bills are 25 % -8 % , how can you roll over 180 % gdp debt ? 
  do you believe that greece can achieve a growth rate than can tackle that much interest rate ? 
  i do not support them , but you expect what exactly of a govt of 4 months who 's hands are tied and ca n't pass any real laws until this whole negotiation ordeal is over ? 
  also , this  so happens that greece 's problem is n't debt , but the chronic deficit does n't make a lick of sense . 
  you know that debt is accrued by the chronic deficit right ? 
  you also do know that we 're running ( or close to ) running a balanced budget already ? 
  dealing with the deficit was `` easy '' , paying $ 10-20b per year on maturing debt is not . 
  your helpful and rational advice would be welcomed , if it was in context to the conversation . 
  interjecting yourself to a conversation with a generic `` pay your taxes and do n't complain '' does nothing to promote the subject we were talking about . 
  so you can either continue this childish behavior or , you know , actually help promote the discussion . 
  if you have something to add to this specific issue i 'm talking about , feel free . 
  else , kindly direct your generic hateful drivel somewhere else . 
  i do n't list how much * more * the cost was compared to sitting at home . 
  i list how much i 've spent in general . 
  plus if i were at home - i would n't be sitting , so it would n't cost me money . 
  on the contrary i would have * made * money . 
  so your parents are greedy cunts who choose to retire early , tax evade , call germans nazis and other fucking slurs and voted for blatantly corrupt politicians ? 
  damn , what did they do to you ? 
  forced you to call giagia for her birthday ? 
  yeah . 
  though to be honest our side has been very/too optimistic from the beginning . 
  so i apply a * bit * of pessimism to all the comments made by them in order to bring them closer to reality . 
   greece finance minister yanis varoufakis said he could rule out a ` grexit ' because it would not be a ** sensible solution ** to the greek debt crisis title suggests v-man ruled out a grexit . 
  taking the rest of the sentence into context however paints a different picture . 
  grexit * is * possible but it 's not the sensible thing to do . 
  and judging by how the negotiations are proceeding , sensibility and logic is on very short demand now days . 
  actually it might cost money , since you will need to replace the conscripted ones in part with regular personnel . 
  the article is badly written and biased , no doubt about that , but take a look at your own translation of the article he 's quoting  philhellenism 's victory again reinforced the humanistic ideals supporting it . 
  the idea that modern greeks were descendants of pericles or socrates and not a mixture of slavs , byzantines and albanians , became dogma for classically educated europeans . 
  not even eu architects could escape it , letting the already needy greece enter the european boat in 1980 . 
  one can admire the results daily . 
  he 's claiming that the eu sentiment about us being the descendants of the ancient greeks was what prompted our acceptance in the eu - while in truth we are slaves / whatever - and the result can be `` admired '' daily . 
  did the keeptalkinggrece dude take it too far ? 
  yeah . 
  but does this make that die welt article any less drivel ? 
  yeah , i am not debating how much a soldier costs . 
  it 's probably higher than that . 
  i was talking about the `` allowance '' or salary of drafted personnel , the talk here makes it sound like people are getting real money when they 're drafted . 
  in truth it actually costs money for the draftee . 
  i spent around $ 2.5-3 .5 k of my money when i was in the army for a year . 
  the `` salary '' for drafted personnel is ~ $ 8/month . 
  not 600 . 
  not 300 , or 360 . 
  eight euros per month . 
  all the other numbers are nonsense , how much one * would * be paid if he did n't live and eat in the barracks etc. 
  which one does not have the option not to - you 're forced to live and eat there . 
  edit : also , does n't he make the connection of what happened then in vienna with what 's happening now in the eu ? 
  if he considers the revolution just , does he consider the whole eu/greece thing to be good as well ? 
   and that it can be done while protecting the poorest pensioners . 
  unless it was changed , one of the creditor demands in regards to the pension system was the abolition of ekas , a pension subsidy/allowance . 
  who gets ekas ? 
  old age and disabled pensioners with annual income of less than $ 8.472,09 per year . 
  pay mind to the fact that not all pensioners get it , only those who receive old age and/or pension for the disabled . 
  which means the effective annual income ( in order to get said pension ) would be less than $ 5040 / year ( or else you 're not entitled to said pension anyway ) . 
  that pension amounts to $ 360 per month . 
  so yeah , protect the poorest , right ? 
  i do not speak german . 
  however from whatever little i understood from the piss-poor google translation , the article can be summarized as this : * greeks destroyed the world order once before ( he was talking about our revolution and independence gain from turkey during 1821 ) . 
  the situation of today resembles that . 
  * greeks got help based on public support because of the concept of the `` ancient greek '' . 
  * greeks are/were not ancient greeks but a mixture of albanians/slavs etc. 
  that is fallmerayer 's theory which was proven not scientific etc. 
  fallmerayer was a proven slavophobe , and his racist theories were a popular component of the nazi propaganda . 
  * the effects of this can be admired every day . 
   the one that 's linked on the site is actually a interesting read . 
  interesting ? 
  well yeah , some might find it interesting to suggest that because we are not really `` greeks '' the situation is as is today .
