  or that a revolution of a people against a conqueror of 400y is bad because it was ... upsetting . . to the world order ... 
  yeah , i read that . 
  and i have no reason to believe this would n't have been accepted by the greek side . 
  leftists are n't that hardcore in military spending , frankly i 'm surprised this offer did n't come from the greek side . 
  well , considering the greek delegation left after only 45 minutes of negotiations , i have a feeling they 're not really keen on the creditor 's proposal . 
  from what i 've read , it was the same proposal they had last week . 
  they require a ~ 1 % gdp cut from pensions and ~ 1 % gdp gains from vat increase . 
  the greek side apparently can squeeze ~ 0.5-1 % of gdp from various sources but the creditors are not content . 
  and this time it seams we did our homework , came with complete list of proposals and counter-proposals that covered the whole spectrum of the creditors issues but in 45m , i doubt there was any time to delve into them . 
  yeah , i would n't pay no mind to the `` predictions '' . 
  i 've added the charts just to compare data between 2010-2013/2014 from various eu countries . 
  just to provide some context . 
  -- [ source ] ( http://www.statista.com ), 
  a very general idea behind the law ( and i might be wrong , but that 's how i understand it ) is this : there 's a part in the constitution that says you can not cut pensions to a point that they do n't meet a standard of living , unless there are extenuating circumstances . 
  the past govt claimed that the circumstances were `` extenuating '' so they went ahead with the cuts . 
  the courts found that , since the primary budget was mostly balanced or had small surplus , the circumstances did not sufficiently warrant such a cut . 
  paying the creditors was not a sufficient excuse to put an already at risk class of people to further burden . 
   the eu and the institutions are making concession after concession for greece check the rough agreement they had after the elections in january against their proposal of last week . 
  then check how much the greek govt conceded from the same agreement . 
  do n't simply listen to the media , do your own research . 
   syriza are n't asking nicely and politely for these concessions but behave like totally dicks let me give you an example that happened this week . 
  a representative of the institutions that is appointed in the finance ministry had varoufakis wait outside of his office . 
  let that sink a bit . 
  we 're not talking about lagarde , or sch\u00e4uble , an ** employee ** had a minister wait inside his own ministry . 
  and since sch\u00e4uble came up , remember what varoufakis [ said ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-11/varoufakis-reveals-his-inner-german-raining-flattery-on-berlin ) about him ? 
  it was like a love letter . 
  what 's sch\u00e4uble position ? 
  oh , just brand your fellow minister [ foolishly naive ] ( http://en.enikos.gr/economy/25377,schaeuble-brands-varoufakis-foolishly-naive-video.html ) . 
  so , yeah . 
  things are not exactly as the media portray them . 
  and if you think they 're mocking the procedure , consider this : such major players as the imf/ecb and ec do n't know what they 're doing . 
  remember the proposal handed to varoufakis only to be replaced much to his surprise with a totally different one the next day ? 
  who 's not taking whom seriously here ? 
  tsipras was the `` good cop '' in the negotiations and they even managed to anger him . 
  is the greek govt amateurs ? 
  undeniably . 
  their handling has been piss-poor . 
  but jesus the amount of disrespect they get for being a new player is astonishing , especially considering that the other parties are experienced diplomats . 
  the money would be in the bankers ... er . . greek hands before the ink goes dry , in case of an agreement . 
  they wo n't wait for the legislation by the greek side as they did not wait during the other tranches of the bailout . 
  the proposed measures would need time to be ironed out and passed in the parliament . 
  first country to leave european union is 1:3 for greece . 
  in/out eu referendum result , 3:1 , is obviously for the uk . 
  where exactly does it list 1:3 for a deal : grexit ? 
  even under the `` opinion '' umbrella , this goes too far . 
  if ft features such pieces , imagine what inaccuracies we 've been reading from other media as well . 
   as i said , i do n't particularly care about the why . 
  the why explains why the greek govt was able to roll back the changes . 
  it explains why the creditors did n't make a fuss and why the greek govt ca n't realistically do it in this case . 
  so if you understand that , how can you still claim that `` they did it once , they can do it again '' in this case . 
   if the creditors are serious about stopping negotiations over implementation of anti-corruption measures they reportedly already agree with , greece ( and everyone else ) should get out asap anyway . 
  we agree on that one . 
  the same thing applies . 
  if they wanted to remove themselves from any conflict , they populace would n't be that receptive to assisting ukraine in any way . 
  helping ukraine * is * a form of opposing russia . 
   yes . 
  i do n't really care for the why in this case . 
  greece still implemented policy that was n't favored by the creditors . 
  it can do so again . 
  you do understand that unconstitutional means unlawful , right ? 
  it does n't matter what the creditors want , if it 's unconstitutional , it is n't valid . 
  creditors ca n't complain why they rolled back on that firing , because doing so means they put themselves at a higher standard than the laws in the country . 
  at best they would ask for that law to be repealed ( they wo n't , as it 's the standard fare about govt contracts ) or ask for x more people to be fired always abiding by the law . 
  so unless it 's unconstitutional , no , they ca n't do it again . 
   if greece implemented some anti-corruption plan tomorrow , do you really think the creditors will stop all negotiations ? 
  would the govt risk it ? 
  thanks for taking the time . 
  he 's referring to the measures that both the creditors and greek govt agree on . 
  he wanted to legislate those measures even before they reach an agreement . 
  the institutions warned that doing so would be seen as taking unilateral actions , regardless if both parties agree that said action needs to be taken . 
  you are talking about the ~ 600 cleaning stuff and some guards . 
  that stuff was fired under pretenses , that were found unconstitutional . 
  creditors required firing x , the then govt obliged using any means , those means had no real basis under the law . 
  so instead of making a law , finding which staff to fire based on needs/other variables , they chose semi-arbitrarily who to fire . 
  added bonus , the reasoning behind firing was that the staff was n't needed , but the court countered by : `` if you did n't need them , why did you hire private cleaning staff later ? '', 
  i am trying to find out the context of the `` unilateral actions '' you 're referring to . 
  where did he mention unilateral actions ? 
  i ca n't find it in the interview . 
   he 's basically saying that greece does n't have and wo n't have any real economy . 
  that the country solely exists to extract more money from creditors and distribute it through public spending . 
  how exactly did you come to that conclusion ? 
  he 's saying that the break away point of the greek economy right now is ~ $ 3b . 
  extract more than that , you 'll get a larger deficit next year . 
  that applies to every country/economy albeit with different numbers ... 
   i said to the eurogroup , why do n't we push some of the legislation we agree on -- the taxation system , the anti-corruption rules -- through parliament and meanwhile continue the negotiations ? 
  i was told if i dare to suggest this again this would constitute reason to settle the negotiations . 
  ( euractiv.com ) i am ashamed and extremely angry . 
  ashamed because i did n't figure it out earlier . 
  angry ... well you 'll understand in a bit . 
  the reason that the creditor side does not want to pass those measures already , is because it would strengthen the greek negotiating position . 
  the greek govt would have something to show for . 
  yes ladies and gentlemen . 
  progress is being halted for a cheap trick . 
  measures that are agreed from both creditors and the greek govt as being essential are not allowed to be applied just to be able to further justify their stance in the negotiations . 
  and from all the crap our govt has pulled , it ** never ** stooped so low . 
  maybe it has to do with how averse the population is to military actions ? 
  i mean , there was overwhelming support for economic assistance to ukraine , so i do n't think indifference is the issue . 
  you 're absolutely right but you 're looking at the one facet of the euro introduction . 
  take a look at this [ chart ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pfr1dzj.jpg ) i made in order to understand that gdp per capita alone does n't tell the whole story ( numbers taken from [ indexmundi ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?v=67&amp;c=fr&amp;l=en ) ) greece was following the same trend as all the countries in the eu . 
  it should n't since obviously the greek economy could n't bare it , but if that correction did n't happen , you would have a huge problem of discrepancies in the eu .
