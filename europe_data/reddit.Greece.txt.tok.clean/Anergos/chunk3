  the terrain was proved an advantage that was probably the main point that allowed for that victory . 
  we 'll buy a couple ... 
  while you did n't ask for greek input specifically , our view of wwii was the typical heroic stuff but mostly contained in the battles that took place in greece . 
  heroic battles repelling a larger and more advanced army ( mussolini ) , bringing the first land victory against the axis , only to be flanked , blitzkrieged and finally surrender to an ever more advanced army ( hitler 's panzers and mountaineers ) . 
  epic tales of resistance against the occupation but great many deaths by starvation , deprivation and extermination . 
  so yeah , while for other countries the most important and defining battles/happenings in wwii took place say in normandy , pearl harbor etc , ours is metaxa 's `` screw you '' to the ultimatum set by mussolini via his ambassador . 
  i love it . 
  unreal , like a scifi movie . 
   greece does not need structural reforms . 
  who on earth is claiming that ? 
  if there is one thing that everyone agrees with , it 's that greece needs structural reforms . 
   the ecb closed the banks , imposed capital controls and withdrawal limits . 
  ecb ** can not ** close the banks , impose capital controls and withdrawal limits . 
  it 's not in their purview . 
  what they can do however is make it that it 's the only real viable solution . 
  when they accepted the greek junk bonds held by the greek banks as a collateral , they were bending their own rules . 
  they could have done a swap , pristine eu bonds for greek govt bonds at a favorable rate for them , but they were n't interested in a `` solution '' , but a leash on the economic system in greece . 
  if we 're not happy , we 'll stop closing our eyes on the fact that junk bonds are used as collateral . 
  which it happened in february and forced greek banks to rely on ela . 
  so while it 's technically true , as it 's not in their mandate , the actual result of their actions promoted the cap controls . 
  it was not the only circumstance that promoted that situation of course , but it sure as hell did n't help the greek problem . 
  iq tests are bollocks . 
  i ca n't understand why anyone is giving any credence to them . 
  like any test , practice makes perfect . 
  a person not taken the `` exam '' before will fare worse than after taking a couple of them and understanding their methodology . 
  a person accustomed to finding solutions to similar problems will always have an edge . 
  same as crossword solving , math problems , enigmas and so on . 
  lastly especially on the tests where linguistics are also tested , it 's highly dependent on the language . 
  doing anagrams in english might be easier than doing anagrams in x language . 
  but hey , people like to grade everything . 
  even things that are subjective like beauty ( pageants ) , food ( cooking contests ) , movies etc. 
  while what he did is morally reprehensible it remains to be seen if it was against the law . 
  if it was , `` i did n't know '' is not a valid excuse . 
  and i bet you he 's anything but dumb . 
  i just hope that if what he did is indeed against the law , he wo n't get away with it just because he has money . 
  it 'll be very upsetting if he used some legal loophole to get out of it . 
  if i made a claim that is even remotely hard to find proof . 
  not a 2 sec google search that is on the first page . 
  what would happen if everyone asks for citations on every little thing ? 
  should i spent all my time on providing citations ? 
  let 's be realistic here . 
   you made claim , do you job and provide source for this claim it 's not my job . 
  i am not paid to inform you . 
  i would gladly help someone who bothered to search and could n't find something but since it was in the first page of google search you did n't even bother to do , why should i ? 
   i 'm confused ... are you worried about greece , or the banks ? 
  if deutsche bank fails , what do you think would happen to germany ? 
  if hsbc fails , what do you thing would happen to uk ? 
  what , you think they 're not interconnected ? 
  greece took a 50bn loan to pay for recapitalization of the banks after the haircut you 're referring to . 
  get the irony ? 
  do a debt haircut and get a loan to pay for the damages done by that haircut . 
   problem solved ? 
  no it 's not . 
  look at the post you 're quoting to see why . 
   citation needed which means bored to do a google search of 5 seconds ? 
  [ france . 
  ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/france/government-bond-yield ) [ france inflation . 
  ] ( http://www.inflation.eu/inflation-rates/france/historic-inflation/cpi-inflation-france.aspx ) do spain yourself . 
  spain 14 % with inflation of 6 % . 
  just before their introduction to the euro . 
  france inflation was sub 3 % from 86 and onwards . 
  average bond rate of 9 % during 86-92 . 
  it ai n't exactly cherry picking is it ? 
  i could go on but i 'm bored to look for other countries as well . 
  now let 's be reasonable . 
  which private bank is going to lend money to a country ready to default ? 
  obviously we 're not talking about a country who was in arrears with the imf just 10 days ago . 
  banking sector is greedy not stupid . 
  but spain , portugal , italy etal ? 
  did they stop ? 
  until something changes and increasing the repo collateral stops increasing the ability for the issuing bank to lend even more , banks will ** always ** have the incentive to lend as much as they can . 
  which leads to banks too big to fail , banks that whole countries ' gdp is not enough to cover in an event of a crisis . 
  greece `` stopped '' complying before syriza came to power . 
  obviously it had nothing to do with the projections being wrong or anything . 
  we were doing `` great '' till they realized that it was n't working . 
  it 's not evil . 
  morality has nothing to do with it . 
  it 's reality . 
  banks before euro had a great thing going on with govt bonds . 
  france 's bonds had a ~ 15 % rate , ridiculous considering that france was assured to not default . 
  sovereign debt was great money . 
  since the inclusion of the euro , even greece had way worse ( or better , depends on the viewpoint ) rates than this . 
  the only way to make money was lend stupendous amounts of money and since most of the eu money is repo financing , lending money meant being able to lend more money and making more money by blowing up your balance sheet etc. 
  so banks started lending left and right to all the countries increasing their dependance on toxic assets . 
  that 's one of the problems . 
  there 's no leash on this . 
   syriza caused it 100 % by its own action . 
  do you know how things work ? 
  why greek banks need recapitalizing , why they are now reliant on ela and so on ? 
  it has nothing to do with syriza . 
  this has being going on since greek govt bonds reached junk status . 
  syriza was the 3rd party then . 
  ecb looking the other way ( and ignoring their own rules ) while greek banks held junk bonds as collateral has everything to do with it . 
  especially when they decide to `` unbend '' their rules just because a party that contains the word `` radical '' came to power . 
  if they did what varoufakis proposed long ago , a swap of junk bonds to pristine ones even at a costly rate for the banks , this would not have happened . 
  they would have taken a small hit but not reach this catastrophic level . 
  but they needed a leash on greece . 
  people still have a wrong understanding of what reform is . 
  reform is not increasing the tax rate from x % to y % . 
  nor cutting spending by z billions or firing n amount of public workers .
