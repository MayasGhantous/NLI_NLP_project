   i mention this , because although siryza promised no more austerity , they 'll eventually have to do it , but it wo n't be a breach of democracy , because most of the greeks support it , if it means staying in the euro . 
  that is not the case . 
  if they have to do it , the govt already stated this , we 'll head for new elections . 
   but that there 's nothing in the greek conditions that is so different in paradigm that one needs some kind of special explanation for it have you read the proposal ? 
  [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/38iqwv/greeces_reform_proposal_to_its_creditors/crvigbo ) i list some key differences . 
  10 % tax hike on electricity and water , a 5 % tax hike in pharmaceuticals . 
  on a country of  25 % unemployed ,  50 % below the poverty line ? 
  i for once would very much like for someone to explain to me how they think this is feasible without bringing the population to their knees . 
   neither required , nor very useful - clearly the terms can not be related to syriza if they were agreed before syriza came to power there were no such terms in the previous agreement . 
   nobody likes austerity ... 
  i do n't really understand the reason for the rest of your text . 
  you are debating the necessity of austerity to what effect ? 
  i did not say austerity was n't needed nor did i advocate other strategies . 
  nor did i say greece is poor because germany is rich ( i do n't get your `` rant '' what all of this has to do with what we were talking about or what i was hoping to convey ? ), 
  the whole debate was about what was deemed `` democratic '' and we 're totally of subject . 
   sure , there are few `` non-political economists '' ** who would agree , but pundits do n't make headlines or a reputation by agreeing with what 's already happening it 's * not * happening . 
  and please now , the proposed measures were so out of this world that it surprised former members of the imf , open letters from economists around the world have been written and tsipras went and made a statement about it to express his disbelief ...  so we have a situation where those who are putting their money where their mouth is think the terms are achievable and necessary i would like to remind you , the same people put their money where their mouth was 5y ago and [ failed ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/05/imf-underestimated-damage-austerity-would-do-to-greece ) . 
  again we have to make a distinction here and i 'll present it in the form of an example : a government of a country was elected based on the mandate of increasing the basic wage to $ 500 . 
  a government of another country was elected as well , but with no mandates of basic wage increase . 
  their citizens though ask for a basic wage increase to $ 500 . 
  if the govt of the first country fails to apply their mandate , it 's undemocratic to continue as a govt . 
  it does n't matter if raising the basic wage is wrong , bad for the people or anything of that nature . 
  they were elected on the premise of wage increase . 
  now lets examine the second country . 
  if they deem that a wage increase is not good for the country and do not cave in the demands , it 's ** not ** undemocratic . 
  they may suffer in the next elections but they did what they were elected to do - look out for the good of their people . 
  if however they deem that a wage increase is not good for the country but still cave in the demands , it 's not because of `` democracy '' . 
  it 's for political reasons - ie to get elected in the next elections . 
  -- on to germany now . 
  merkel 's party is pro-european . 
  that was/is their mandate . 
  the german people may not want to bailout greece . 
  if merkel deems that a grexit would be harmful to the eu/ez and to germany especially , it 's not undemocratic to bail out greece , even if many of her people do n't agree . 
  that 's the role of leaders , to make difficult decisions . 
   the terms of greece 's bailout are in line with those for other bailout countries that is not the case , nor should it be . 
  the circumstances are way different for the bailout terms to be `` in line '' between the bailout countries . 
  greece had ( and has ) to reform more since the situation was ( and is ) more dire . 
  example [ 1 ] ( http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/02/22/opinion/022212krugman1/022212krugman1-blog480.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/22/austerity-europe/&amp;h=361&amp;w=480&amp;tbnid=f_3dfybmpenpzm:&amp;zoom=1&amp;docid=jr4j22v4kw1vum&amp;ei=zjhyvfyofme5ubxvglag&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=0cfaqmygpmck&amp;biw=1029&amp;bih=659 ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/11/austerity_comparison.jpg ) and bear in mind those figures were taken before many of the measures took effect . 
  we took heavier loans and understandably the terms needed to be harsher . 
   no , you can assume it if you like that kind of explanation well if you can find a - non politician - economist that argues the terms are reasonable , i am open to changing my mind . 
  replace `` on '' with `` europ\u00e9en '' and you 're there . 
  reforms were ( and are ) a necessity regardless of which strategy we 'll end up following . 
  balancing the primary budget , cutting down on unnecessary expenses , increasing productivity , all of those things are necessary and are not prerogatives of austerity . 
  setting obscene targets for primary surpluses , increasing taxation by as much as 10 % in areas that affect the poorest segments of the greek people , freezing and lowering the lower-end pensions however are not reasonable measures . 
  the whole thing appears more punitive/disciplinary than an actual attempt to guide greece into a recovery . 
  i was referring to the indifference of the markets to which approach a govt will take in order to tackle their finances . 
  i was not talking whether the economy was sustainable at that time if they continued with the same strategy . 
  let me reiterate this : the markets would n't care if greece used an austerity model to tackle their crumbling economy or a fiscal stimulus or quantitative easing . 
  they only care about the outcome , not ** how ** that outcome is reached . 
  rocket propelled grenades ? 
  i guess the old fruit basket and wine is n't enough anymore ... 
  why stop there ? 
  there should be a german euro , an italian euro a french euro , a greek euro and so on . 
  though i guess that might cause confusion so we need to come up with different names . 
  hm , something like deutsche mark , italian lira , french franc , drachma seems reasonable . 
  you must make a distinction here . 
  the bailout helped greece to stay in the ez . 
  the conditions attached to it is a different issue though . 
  if you think that the past 5 years show an improvement in the ability of greece to payout their loans , then yes , you 're right . 
  personally , i do n't think that 's the case . 
   austerity pressure comes from the financial markets and greece got no more credit there . 
  the markets do n't care if you follow a hardline austerity program or a fiscal stimulus program or whatever . 
  they care about risk and stability . 
  example : you can have greece party , increase the salaries by 100 % , create huge deficits and the markets would be happy to oblige if the situation is deemed sustainable . 
  the austerity policies comes as a requirement for the bailout loans , ie to ensure greece can pay . 
   this is also known , when one wants to argue the other way , as democratic governments being responsive to their voters . 
  they were n't elected on the premise of enforcing specific economic policies on countries who failed the eu . 
  you ca n't even claim you 're imposing those measures for the good of your own people . 
  there is * no one * that can predict the measure of damage a grexit will do . 
  on the other hand , you can safely assume that part of the reason the proposed measures are such because a ) the greek govt happens to be leftist and b ) for disciplinary reasons . 
  both of which do n't exactly promote the spirit of democracy . 
  interesting idea , however the logistics make it unrealistic in my opinion . 
  during 2009 , deporting illegal immigrants was costing  [ $ 1100 ] ( http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ic65drvifv0j:www.posyfy.gr/index.php%3foption%3dcom_content%26view%3darticle%26id%3d299:kostos-metanasth%26catid%3d100:2011-10-26-07-21-01+&amp;cd=5&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk ) per immigrant to the greek state . 
  can you phantom the cost of relocating that many people to so far a distance ? 
  however creating infrastructure to the countries that receive most of the immigrants or near the place of origin ( make a center for refugees in syria or baring that , near the borders in turkey ) and policing it , is probably viable . 
  i am not accusing turkey or anything , do n't get me wrong . 
  but the thing is , we have problems dealing with a couple thousand immigrants . 
  how can we help turkey to such an extend , that they 'll consider actively stopping the immigration flow from their country to ours ? 
  they ca n't effectively police 600km of borders to stop the flow there even with eu 's help . 
  deporting them back to syria from turkey is a lost cause . 
  come now , invaders ? 
  plus a human being is a human being . 
  it does n't matter if they 're european , syrian or whatever . 
  you 're suggesting we dump them in the ocean , wash our hands and claim it 's not our problem ? 
  you would n't consider that recourse for a child molester or a murderer if he 's from your country . 
  is being born in the wrong part of the world a graver offense ? 
  if we were talking about crossing land borders we would have more options . 
  we can make finding boats really hard ( some kind of international law which treats the original owners of said boats say as human smugglers ) but how are we going to enforce said laws ? 
  would say turkey agree to that litigation ? 
  apart from that what else ? 
  hook the boats and release them in international waters ? 
  those vessels most times do n't make it on one trip , are we going to rubber band them till they decide to return to the other shore or their vessel sinks ? 
  yeah captivity , thanks . 
  unfortunately it 's not that simple . 
  firstly i would hesitate calling those immigrant crafts [ * boats * ] ( http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00999/boat-immigrants_999207a.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/10865652/illegal-immigration-to-europe-shows-sharp-rise.html&amp;h=400&amp;w=620&amp;tbnid=jwuql7spwfbmsm:&amp;zoom=1&amp;docid=jfjmojm1oppjfm&amp;ei=wejxvfm4hchcususglgh&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=0cdgqmyggmay&amp;biw=1376&amp;bih=676 ) much less ships . 
  they 're floating death-traps and in most cases they 're single use only . 
  how are they going to prevent such a vessel from landing ? 
  threaten to sink it ? 
  the moment they leave turkey 's soil it 's game over . 
  turkey sure as hell wont bother stopping said vessels from leaving nor can we force them to turn around .
