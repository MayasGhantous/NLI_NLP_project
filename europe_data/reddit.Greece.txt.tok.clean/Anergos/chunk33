  lastly after landing , we ca n't really return them to their homelands either . 
  no documentations means no proof of where they 're from and even in the cases where they do carry documentation returning them would be a diplomatic nightmare . 
  the only possible solutions i see are : a ) infrastructure to receive immigrants and route them to places where they can be assimilated . 
  b ) help their countries resolve the issue that caused immigration in the first place . 
  this . 
  till we find a better alternative , ensure that treatment of lab animals is as fair as can be . 
  ensure that all lab animals are x generations . . hm . . ~ ~ home grown ~ ~ * captive-born . 
  * sorry my english fails me - what 's the word for animals born and brought up far from nature / under human supervision ? 
  * the color scheme is very distracting . 
  * titles not being justified makes reading more difficult . 
  especially glossing over . 
  * flairs are somewhat ambiguous . 
  what 's the difference between eu and news ? 
  why do we need such flairs to begin with ? 
  ** my proposition : ** make them less prominent and put them in the end of the title . 
  or remove them altogether . 
  ** edit : ** hm , now the size is uniform which makes some of my points less relevant . 
  it 's still more tiring to read though . 
  actually there 's a pretty logical reason for vat being lower on books and theater visits . 
  you * want * educated and cultured people . 
  having a lower tax is a good way to promote education and culture . 
  by increasing their vat you 're not going to increase govt income , you 're going to decrease the demand for books and the attendance of theaters . 
  then you watch the video , read the translation in the comments and realize that the officer did nothing wrong . 
  i mean the dude makes accusations without having the common sense of finding someone to translate the video for him . 
  what did he expect ? 
  when you buy a chocolate , that says it 's almond chocolate , has pictures of almonds on the package , you expect to get an almond chocolate . 
  it 's reasonable expectations . 
   people who really care can check the list of ingredients printed on the box . 
  so you 'll have all the people at the supermarket checking every single thing they buy , reading all the ingredients , to make sure that they 're actually getting the thing that 's advertised in the box ? 
  * - honey grab the `` whole wheat flour '' . 
  but do check if the fibers are ~ 12.8 g per cup instead of ~ 2.6 g as they may advertise their product however they want and it might be white flour . 
  main differences between the two proposals . 
  1 ) ** primary surplus targets ** year | creditors | greek govt : -- | : -- | : -- 2015 | 1 % | .6 % 2016 | 2 % | 1.5 % 2017 | 3 % | 2.5 % 2018 + | 3.5 % | 3.5 % 2 ) ** vat changes ** : product | current | creditors | greek govt : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- medicines | 6.5 % | 11 % | 6 % basic foods | 13 % | 11 % | 11 % energy | 13 % | 23 % | 11 % water | 13 % | 23 % | 11 % hotels | 13 % | 11 % | 11 % processed foods | 23 % | 11 % ( ? 
  ) | 23 % books | 6.5 % | 23 % | 6 % theater | 6.5 % | 23 % | 6 % island vat | 30 % reduction | no reduction | 30 % reduction 3 ) ** pensions ** increase the participation of pensioners for pharmaceuticals ( creditors ) . 
  remove the ekas benefit ( social solidarity benefit for pensioners ) . 
  freeze the minimum pension till 2021 . 
  some others ----- 10 % tax hike on electricity and water . 
  5 % tax hike on medicines while at the same time increasing the participation of said medicines . 
  also , who do you think you are , reading books in a period of austerity ... 16.5 % tax hike . 
  lastly , islands will suffer . 
  they had one advantage to offset the shipping costs etc , lower vat , no more though . 
  and we keep the 3.5 % surplus target anyway ... 
  most of greek stuff are irrelevant/wrong to be honest . 
  catholic greeks ? 
  we have more people believing in zeus than adhering to the pope . 
  you 're referring to ancient spartans as pederastic as if it is a bad thing . 
  you know you ca n't pass judgement on a 3000 year old civilization using today 's social norms , right ? 
  shakespeare 's juliet was just 13 , was romeo a `` pedophile '' ? 
  was shakespeare a sicko who fantasized about `` teen '' girls ? 
  pericles would n't understand a word of modern greek . 
  no shit . 
  if shakespear walked the roads of modern stratford , would he understand a word the modern brits are saying ? 
  plus the other random insults . 
  i mean , anyone would take insult if called a fascist prick , it 's not just a greek thing . 
  -- meh , you can do better . 
  hey is n't there supposed to be a price limit to the gifts ? 
  i call shenanigans - that 's bribing , look at the size of the damn fish ... 
  bless you man , i needed the laugh . 
  i hear poland has some * spare * land . 
  or if you prefer the mediterranean climate and a more capitalistic approach , you can get some pretty cheap islands here . 
  there 's a slight distinction . 
  one chooses the target the other does n't care . 
  plus there is the ottawa treaty already for the mines . 
  csm-101 's should be banned even before their inception . 
  while i agree with your previous comment about unification , i 'll have to point out that not all representatives will be equal . 
  you can see an example of it in a hypothetical scenario : say spain , portugal and italy had a change of heart and supported the greek side of the negotiations with the ec while germany insisted on their views . 
  would it make any difference ? 
  now flip the table . 
  say germany had a change of heart and supported the greek side of the negotiations . 
  huge difference . 
  that in a council of 30 ( 28 voting ) equals . 
  yeah in a hypothetical federation the waters will be more muddy but that still does n't mean that the german representation wo n't carry more weight that other representatives . 
  that 's the case in the us as well , the senators from alaska or hawaii do n't carry the same weight as cali or ny for instance . 
  do n't get me wrong , it 's not that i believe that in the event of a federalization we 'll be ruled by `` ze germans '' but make no mistake about it , their voices will be heard more . 
  it 's not so much about the symbols as it 's the history and acts . 
  talking about some defining moment of the past , a great deed or a person . 
  a good performance in a sporting event for instance , a walk in a museum or a documentary about the struggle in a past war . 
  we do n't really need a king or a flag to invoke those patriotic feelings . 
   they will vote with their feet though , if they are spending # 1,000 on a holiday there are plenty of places they can go and it wont be kos . 
  if it were the store owners / hotels that were complaining , it would be understandable , especially during this crisis . 
  it 's one thing to hurt your living though and another to be inconvenienced . 
   besides most people these days barely have any sympathy with anyone , i know personally for my entire life whenever i turned on the tv the news told me how someone 's died , been raped , assaulted , killed themselves and their family etc. 
  for international stories it is the same , here is a child in africa nearly dead give us money , here is a warzone give us money then the next month comes around and the same message appears but for a different warzone , or this time its an earthquake . 
  just because we are desensitized by the media does n't mean we should n't behave like decent human beings though . 
  plus no one is asking money , those people are not beggars . 
  it 's just a shitty situation . 
  imagine you 're on the m6 returning from work and there 's an accident in front of you . 
  will you start yelling at the person bleeding to hurry up and move his car just because he 's inconveniencing you ? 
  it 's the same thing , curse your luck , hope he 's ok and be patient . 
  i have no knowledge of that . 
  i know that the law does n't * prohibit * same sex marriage , but it 's not recognized either . 
  during 2008 a couple did get married but the then minister of justice decreed that the marriage did not have a legal standing . 
  edit : anyway , remember the fuss the church pulled when abolishing the documenting of the religion on the ids ? 
  well , imagine what will happen if they try to pass what is effectively a legalization of gay marriage . 
   this happened to me today ... twice now, 
   why should the state treat any union in any manner ? 
  why should the state care whether people are in a union or not ? 
  well , they should . 
  it simplifies things . 
  you file for one tax return , you can jointly own things , represent one another in many matters etc.
