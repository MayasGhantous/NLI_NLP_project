   how is marriage not a completely outdated and unfair construct that should be abolished ? 
  apart from those aforementioned practical reasons , there are perception reasons as well . 
  it 's a way to distinguish a `` simple '' relationship from a committed one . 
  also it 's essentially a `` binding '' contract in that sense . 
  if marriage was to be abolished , how would you go about breaking that union ? 
  if there is no contractual distinction between a simple relationship and a committed one , how would go about owning stuff and in the event of a separation , dividing said stuff ? 
  there are plenty of reasons for a recognized by the state union . 
  it 's not empathy . 
  unless you 've been in a war torn country , walked god knows how many km , crossed the sea in a shitty raft , you 're not talking about empathy . 
  you 're talking about sympathy . 
  or at the very basic level , understanding . 
  which in this case , yes you should have . 
   we have our own problems and would like a nice fucking peaceful holiday . 
  if i pay 1000 quid for a holiday , i would like it to be a holiday . 
  you would like it to be a holiday and i would like for you to have a great time here , but shit does n't always work like we want to . 
  spending 1000 quid does n't mean you can control the weather , natural disasters or as is in this case , humanitarian crises . 
  i am ashamed to say nowhere close , at least here in greece . 
  the church holds way too much influence still and the old generation still caters to the `` old ideas '' . 
  maybe the new generation , if we manage to pull out of this crisis , will be `` progressive '' enough . 
  the legalization of same-sex marriage does affect you . 
  you are giving the same protections , benefits and rights to a gay couple union that a heterosexual couple union already enjoys . 
  which is perfectly fine apart from the fact that some of these benefits were given to secure/advance procreation . 
  this is n't about recognizing the right of a homosexual couple 's union , or their right to be together - i hope we 're way past that . 
  it 's about the state treating that union in the same manner they treat a heterosexual one . 
  which in my opinion , they should . 
  hey , if you have problems populating your jails i volunteer . 
  it 's way better than my place . 
  plus it 's already full of ikea stuff anyway . 
  -- on a more serious note , that 's great news . 
  the crisis here sadly pushed things the other way ... 
   sure . 
  and now , amazon will have to raise prices . 
  let them . 
  competition will sort it out . 
  plus now let 's be frank . 
  in the eu , amazon is n't * that * great . 
  i 've been shopping from both uk and de ( though all my stuff comes in . fr boxes but anyway ) and prices are n't `` great '' . 
  i mainly use them for stuff i ca n't find anywhere else with decent shipping . 
  and that compared to greek prices which is telling . 
  amazon customers * are * already paying the due tax . 
  example : [ price from uk store ( 20 % vat ) . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/junegun.jpg ) [ what i 'm paying ( 23 % vat in my country ) . 
  the * net * you 're linking is the balance of expenditure and revenue . 
  revenue is mostly the country 's contribution to eu 's import taxes . 
  that directly correlates to * what * that country imports and how much of it . 
  it 's not comparable , ie you ca n't say that country x is `` good '' because they import from china a product which carries a heavy import tax but y country is `` bad '' because their imports are mainly from within eu ( or are products that do not carry a heavy import duty ) . 
  so slash that . 
  well , you may say let 's look at how much eu spends on each country . 
  that might have carried some weight if say you 're looking at it from a % of gni point of view , but again , circumstances . 
  example : a large percentage of eu expenditure is about preservation of natural resources . 
  is x country bad because they have more forests that y country ? 
  --  not trying to point fingers at the greeks here , i was surprised with the hungarian amount as well !, 
  the problem is , you might not be pointing fingers ( what 's to point , it 's not in our hands to increase or decrease that funding ) but you are helping in propagating the `` we are paying for greeks bla bla '' nonsense . 
  these stats are not to be used like that . 
  many great things here . 
  but * majority * voting for veto defeats/diminishes the purpose of having a veto in the first place . 
  if the legislation passes the eu parliament , then very seldom will it not represent the majority of the `` council of ministers '' . 
  veto should give power to the minorities . 
  though it should be treated as a very serious political currency , not lightly , as a matter of last stand . 
   do n't make any sense to me . 
  it 's not only you . 
  birthright ? 
  * playing * it frugal ? 
  merkel 's govt will collapse if we do n't pay ? 
  syriza anti-democratic political force ? 
  and that gentleman is a strategic adviser to a nato commander ? 
  lastly and somewhat irrelevant , kabuki reference for greece ? 
  i mean he 's using a * japanese * theater drama simile for greece ? 
  that hurts more than the rest of the crap he 's spewing . 
  well he did n't steal them , he bought them . 
  ... but not from their proper owner . 
  first of all , i was commenting on your sensationalist post . 
  it 's not what the greeks are `` essentially '' asking for . 
  it might set a precedent that would have an adverse effect on some museums , sure . 
  but that 's an after effect . 
  but then again , every museum which hosts `` contentious '' items , be it of foreign or domestic origin , should be liable to return said items to their rightful owner given sufficient evidence . 
  just because it has worked fine for some museums this far does n't mean it 's the correct or indeed the right way to go . 
  and sorry to say this but if your museum 's existence is threatened by the return of some of `` their '' exhibits , then maybe , just maybe , it should n't have existed in the first place . 
  lastly , i would like to say that characterizing the greek reasoning behind the return of the parthenon marbles as `` muh feelings '' is really demeaning and to be frank , * idiotic * . 
   no court is going to single handedly rule to destroy every major museum in the world . 
  which is essentially what the greeks are asking for . 
  i distinctly remember we are * essentially * asking for a collection of marbles back , not the destruction of every major museum in the world . 
  glad to see our govt has n't lost its marbles completely . 
  our ** maximum ** offered solution here in greece is half the ** minimum ** solution in that catalog ( 50mbps ) . 
  and let me not get into the crippled upload speeds ( 3.5 mbps up for the 50mbps connection ) or the prices . 
  plus the `` up to '' moniker . 
  my 24/1 connection is essentially a 11/0 .60 . 
  i wanted to upload a 4g file , took me close to 1 day while i prayed for no powercuts / line drops . 
  on the bright side our isps have n't reached at&t levels ( yet ) . 
  that 's a great idea . 
  i was considering the same thing . 
  if the eu does n't compromise in the negotiations , the only real alternative for greece is to declare war . 
  we 'll conquer germany first , brussels ( we do n't need the whole belgium , we 'll use the fact that 's basicaly the default capital of eu as casus bellii ) then head to washington dc to root out the imf . 
  we 'll probably take a stab at turkey for historical reasons . 
  after we conquered half of europe and some states in the us , we 'll force all the involving parties in our economic crisis to eat tzatziki daily . 
  tzatziki addiction is soon to follow which the media will pick up and advertise , and that addiction will spread like wildfire in the world . 
  the war will be known as the tzatziki enlightenment . 
  garlic will no longer be a stench . 
  it will be a perfume . 
  free the garlic .
