  how are greek people going to buy food and medicines ? 
  do you see lidl or any other exporter rushing to drop prices on their primary goods in greece ? 
   because the claim has no legal value , and greecce knows it . 
  otherwise they would have taken it to court . 
  the issue is that you dont throw what you know to be a bogus claim into someones face while also effectively asking for donations . 
  greece is ultimately reliant on goodwill from other nations , and theyre doing a stunning job at pissing it away . 
  how exactly are you sure that it has no legal value ? 
  are you expert in international law and have examined the greek documents ? 
  up until they actually put those documents under examination by experts , no one can tell , not me , not you . 
  and what donations are you talking about ? 
  who 's giving greece free money ? 
  30 billion loan over 5 years netted a healthy 2billion profit , i would n't call that a donation . 
  no one is giving `` free money '' . 
  --  im pretty confident they could , its not an impossible thing to do like you make it seem . 
  the reason they dont is because its much more reasonable not to do so , so long as you can afford it . 
  greece cant afford it though , because they simply have too much debt , so their total deficit is too high if they dont manage to run a pretty high primary surplus . 
  there is n't a single economist that says it 's doable . 
  i mean , your country , the epitome of austerity , with the lowest unemployment in eu , in a top economic shape and with excellent efficiency , reached a 3 % surplus once from 1995 . 
  you expect a country with 25 % unemployment to sustain itself for that long a period of time with 4.5 % ? 
  let 's be reasonable now ... --  greece hasnt `` followed a program '' . 
  greece has been given parameters they would be required to meet in order to receive financial help . 
  greece has failed and keeps failing to meet them . 
  that doesnt automatically mean that the standards are `` unrealistic '' , considering that greece has not managed to actually nail down its tax evasion problem in that timeframe , for example . 
  it 's not a program ? 
  well ec thinks it is . 
  why would they name it [ `` economic adjustment programme '' ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/occasional_paper/2014/op192_en.htm ) . 
  but let us not stick to word definitions . 
  greece has failed ? 
  well [ oecd ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j1cucudxysu/vn-d3bua7xi/aaaaaaaabf4/rtwughqxuyg/s1600/oecd%2breform%2bchart.png ) has something to say about it . 
  if anything greece was the most responsive to the `` parameters '' . 
  so greece was pretty much on target with the `` programme '' or the `` parameters '' if you want it to be called that way . 
  who was n't and admitted that much [ themselves ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/05/imf-underestimated-damage-austerity-would-do-to-greece ) ? 
   they do n't have to follow the eu 's plans and in return they do n't get the eu 's money . 
  the problem is , `` eu '' 's plans are n't working . 
  all the projections by the troika proved dead wrong , they admitted that much themselves . 
  why not allow a couple of months leeway for a different solution , a solution that might be to the benefit of both greece and the creditors . 
   gdp performance linked bonds that the rest of europe has to back ? 
  thats like me declaring a bond based on if i get a high paying job and that my neighbor has to pay if i do n't get it . 
  and if i just stay home forever then not only do i still get the money but my neighbor suffers . 
  come now with the silly similes . 
  germany was given a similar benefit 60-70 years ago and it worked pretty great , did n't it ? 
  why not allow the same treatment for greece ? 
  it 's like you 're implying greece does n't want to evolve , be stronger economically and would be complacent and dormant if bonds like these were to happen . 
  let 's be realistic here , given two choices , of defaulting - which will probably happen if things continue like this , or link the debt to growth , which would be the better choice for the creditors ? 
  if there was n't an issue with other countries following suite , i guarantee this would be the first solution in everyone 's mind . 
  but politics being what they are , it 's more of a vindictive treatment and a cautionary tale for other members of the eu . 
   greece did n't have to accept the bailout funds from the imf at all . 
  though arguably it would have been better to default right there and then , you 'll have to understand we 're talking about a country . 
  not a person . 
  and if defaulting meant going against the will of the people which was overwhelmingly pro-european , then it 's not much of a choice , is it ? 
   demanding that germany pay 270 billion euros which strangely seems close to the number of their debt is sort of suspicious ... 
  so what ? 
  why do you fret ? 
  why do you even care ? 
  three scenarios here : a ) they go to hague and get shot down . 
  all is well . 
  b ) they go to hague and some/all of their demands have merit . 
  again , all is well ( unless you deem that germany does not need to settle its debts for some reason but greece does ) c ) they do nothing . 
  all is well . 
  so , i 'm asking again : why do you care ? 
   debts were written off in 2010 and 2012 . 
  yeah . 
  private creditors faced haircut , mainly the greek banks and social security funds . 
   perhaps you could explain what more help greece should become do you understand what that `` help '' entailed ? 
  name me one country in the world that can sustain a 4.5 % primary surplus and not be crippled for decades . 
  not germany , not uk , not the us . 
  there is no country in the world , apart from maybe tolkien 's hobbits in the middle earth and in the great minds of people running the institutions . 
  for 5 years greece followed the program , it failed . 
  time for a new approach . 
  give the greek govt a chance - though personally i have very low hopes - and some leeway . 
  to be honest , we could do without them . 
  yeah , deterrence is nice and all , but have you considered the competency of those involved with maintaining them ? 
  i was reading an article a couple of months ago about the state of the us nuclear arsenal and let me tell you , it was horrifying . 
  a jet armed with a nuke left the airport and landed elsewhere . 
  noone knew that it was carrying a nuke . 
  the nuke was left exposed on the aircraft for several days before anyone took notice . 
  bunker doors in nuclear silo not working properly . 
  pizza delivery guy was making a drop and simply wandered off in there . 
  high ranking person in charge of - i do n't remember exactly what , codes , some silos , a part of the nuke program , something like that - was a gambler . 
  at one point , you 'll have to ask yourself a question : do you feel more threatened from an actual nuclear attack from a country that would n't have used nukes if they feared nuclear retaliation , or an accident / incompetency / unlucky event ? 
  god dammit . 
  i really wish there were captions in their - other - videos . 
  all the clips that are available in english or with subs have been ** excellent ** , i really want to watch the rest of them . 
  i do not understand why you exclude greece from `` the actual winners '' of wwii . 
  were they not part of the [ allied powers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allies_of_world_war_ii ) ? 
  just because it was n't a major power , does not mean it was excluded or that the peace treaty affected only the british , french and the americans . 
  that 's the first point i wanted to refute , you 're talking as if greece did not take part in the wwii or that somehow the peace treaty did not involve them . 
  the second point i wanted to refute is that greece * has * asked multiple times about the reparations from 1960 and onwards . 
  -- i am ** not ** debating if the reparations are justified , lawful or otherwise . 
  i am ** not ** saying it 's a smart move , i am ** not ** saying it 's the correct thing to do . 
  what i am saying though is that your points were wrong . 
  greece did take part in wwii with the allies and the peace treaty did involve them . 
  greece has repeatedly asked for reparations since then . 
  that 's all . 
   there are peace treaties between germany and those who won the war - greece is not a part of those [ greek role in wwii . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_history_of_greece_during_world_war_ii ) [ reparations granted for wwii ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paris_peace_treaties,_1947 )  anyway , why did n't greece bother to ask for reparations in the last 70 years ? 
  they 've asked multiple times . 
  from 1960 , via the greek ambassador till after the unification of germany . 
  tone the drugs down . 
  i am not .
