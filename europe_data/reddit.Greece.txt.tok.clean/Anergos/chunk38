  foreign media , be it bbc , telegraph or whatever are really unreliable concerning the greek situation . 
  and that 's putting it lightly . 
  greece does n't want to deal with imf , ec and ecb , greece sent the wrong `` letter '' , greece was late sending the `` letter '' , greece asks money from russia , greece is printing drachmas , greece ca n't pay the next imf installment and so on . 
  and there was n't a single retraction . 
  it 's mandated by law to take . . hm . .15 ? 
  lessons . 
  you also take a written exam and if you pass that , you take an actual driving test ( drive in the city/district of the closest transportation dept ) with two examiners . 
  so that 's not the issue , if anything it 's pretty strict ( i failed the first time even though i was a pretty decent driver ) . 
  things may have changed though , it was like that years back when i got my license . 
  -- driving `` behavior '' ca n't be taught i am afraid . 
  we are pretty aggressive behind the wheel for some reason . 
  temperament ? 
  plus everyone thinks he 's the best driver he knows . 
  and the roads here are ... well ... let 's just say i can walk out of my house and i wo n't be able to find a patch of road 20m long without a hole of some kind . 
  if i had to give a warning to tourists concerning automobilism , that would be to not rent scooters . 
  especially if you have little to no experience as it tends to happen . 
  at least in a car you 're relatively safe . 
  scooter + little experience + greek roads + greek drivers = not good for your health . 
  let the two wheeled deathmobiles to those with experience . 
  i find it hard to believe . 
  i mean us and the italians are pretty hot-blooded , but germans ? 
  i mean the horn here is a substitute for giving the middle finger 95 % of the time , the rest 5 % is to express our admiration to a passing female ... 
  it 's not only due to the high demands , relatively high salary reduces the allure of `` bribing '' , whatever form it may take . 
  though politicians in general tend to come from wealthy families , but anyway . 
  thank you very much for taking the time to do this . 
  only 24 years collecting that much ** every day ** and we 're debt free . 
  nope . 
  you 're going about it wrong . 
  which version are you sure is faked ? 
  the index finger one ( 396.1 in your link ) . 
  compare the index finger one with the middle finger one and the one with no finger . 
  you 'll see the index finger has no fold as well . 
  want another one ? 
  what color are varoufakis shirt buttons ? 
  black / w white insides . 
  what color is the cufflink button with the middle finger ? 
  mat black . 
  the button should have looked like [ this ] ( http://rowvid.com/?v=meuwxnifjj8 ) at 2323.51, 
  so if your country did n't invest in the loan agreement , that money would have went to * your * poor ? 
   of course we dont hate each other , why should we ? 
  i was under the same impression till two days ago . 
  i wo n't get into much detail , suffice to say this is n't the case . 
  what we say and what we do are two totally different things unfortunately . 
  come now .

  it does n't have to mean anything . 
   if they had n't cooked their books and lied to the other members they would n't have been able to join in the first place . 
  yeah they would . 
  did they ( we ) lie ? 
  sure . 
  would the truth have led to greece not entering the third stage of the emu ? 
  nope . 
  the `` real '' government budget deficit was 3.6 % while the deficit criterion was 3.0 with the provision that slightly higher deficits will be acceptable if `` the deficit ratio has declined substantially and continuously before reaching the level close to the 3 % limit '' . 
  which in this case , it did . 
  oh lord ... i had to google the spelling of `` parce que '' ... and i am not sure if `` le parlent '' is correct ... op is right , the english people have ruined me . 
  yeah but what happens when you turn 18 but already have the neutered version ? 
  stupid measure . 
  a game should have a permanent rating reflecting how the game devs want it to be and that 's it . 
  if you 're old to play it , good . 
  if not , wait a couple of years more . 
   so for those whose first language is not english , would it be helpful to correct mistakes ? 
  no , not really . 
  it would be helpful if the person in question was not aware of the actual punctuation/mistake , but how can you be sure it 's not just a typo ? 
  i hate reading people 's posts where they mix `` their '' with `` they 're '' e.t.c but am also pretty confident that i 've made that mistake once or twice . 
  so unless it 's a serial thing - which is n't easy to tell - it would be improper and bothersome . 
  again with the misconceptions . 
  better be ignorant than misinformed i reply . 
  austerity in economics , is a policy , not a virtue . 
  having sound spending is not austerity , it 's common sense and it can and should be applied on all competing policies . 
  take your pick : ** option 1 : the good christian . 
  ** even the nazis have a place with god . 
  jesus is carrying the soldier 's stuff ( weapon and backpack which signify the soldier 's burden ) while he journeys from life to death . 
  ** option 2 : nazis exploited christianity . 
  ** the soldier uses jesus as a pack-mule . 
  jesus accepts the role in hope that he will convince him of his evil . 
  that 's what they are debating . 
  ** option 3 : jesus was a nazi supporter . 
  ** jesus , hateful of the jews and what `` they did to him '' , supports the nazis . 
  ** option 4 : halloween party . 
  ** two friends are heading to a masque/halloween party . 
  one is dressed like jesus or a greek philosopher the other as a nazi soldier . 
  the jesus character carries his friends accessories since that friend 's suit is pressed/ironed and he wants to look sharp . 
  well , i assume she/he means that those who are well off do n't really bother to pirate stuff , they just buy it . 
  you seem to neglect two factors : 1 . 
  the ac unit does * not * run all the time in this scenario . 
  it runs when the thermostat detects an increase in temperature . 
  so how long it runs depends on the insulation . 
  ac units do not feature a flat efficiency curve . 
  like most electronics when pushed hard , they consume disproportionate amounts of energy . 
  there can be up to a 43 % increase in power consumption depending on the difference in temperature on a reference ac unit ( [ source ] ( http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy13osti/56354.pdf ) ) . 
  if the insulation is such that the for the unit to keep the temperature stable requires less than - in this example - 1.4 times the amount of time it takes to cool the room from ambient , then you actually save cost by letting it run . 
  if you also take into account that during nights the ac unit needs to work even less , it 's not a stretch to imagine conserving energy by letting it run for 2 days idly vs a full on run for a couple of hours before monday starts . 
  the premise of a good ui is to do things with as little clicks/moves as possible . 
  before : move pointer to new  click . 
  now : move pointer to sidebar  click  move pointer to new  click . 
  that 's double the effort . 
  you sacrificed usability for looks . 
  not really worth it imo . 
  we 're not nor are we certain to be `` eligible '' even after they will consider it ( july/august ) . 
  he 's wrong .
