  we are not . 
  ecb currently holds `` too much '' greek debt to buy more . 
  if we meet the july and august repayments then we might be eligible . 
   ** if ** the ecb included us in the qe programme or reinforced waiver , irrespective of the actual economic effect in the short run , it would have a very important symbolic effect . 
  tsakalotos , minister of finance source : [ reuters ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-greece-qe-idusb5n11a021 ) , 2 march 2016, 
  same here . 
  we have n't had an incident of imported terrorism for 25y now ( knocks on wood ) . 
  anarchists putting [ propane/butane canisters ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yiqolvdr0yi/ufumk3uw9gi/aaaaaaaajvy/nytef7n9c9m/s1600/gkazakia-venzini.jpg ) outside a bank at night and blowing it up ? 
  sure . 
  but isil type of attacks or attacks in general connected to islam radicals ? 
  nope . 
  speaking of `` molon labe '' , how about them marbles uk ? 
  can you * loan * them back to us ? 
  we `` promise '' to return them . 
   wait , let me summarize that . 
  that 's not a summary , that 's paraphrasing . 
  unless my english is pretty rusty , i though i was being clear . 
  my comment was : `` it has nothing to do with ww2 ** and ** garnering sympathy for greece '' the `` and '' being the key word here . 
  as in , he did n't mention wwii to gain sympathy for greece as the parent comment suggests . 
   comparing the refugee camp in idomeni to a concentration camp where tens of thousands were tortured and killed is understandable please do point out where exactly i said that . 
   you only doubt that the refugee camps in your own country are comparable to concentration camp now , you 're one of two persons : either you want to be totally literal , everybody should expressively mean what write with no room for expressions . 
  in which case , yes , i seriously doubt . 
  since i have n't been in idomeni and sure as hell i have n't been in dachau , i can only doubt . 
  or you leave some wiggle room for figures of speech , in which case , yes , i seriously doubt that [ ... ] now either way , what was the point of your question ? 
   of course , why would you take a poltician literal . 
  nformation and data is meaningless . 
  he is like an artist , a muse , that just serenades about beauty and form . 
  yes , it 's just our politicians that use figures of speech . 
  your politicians are angels , only use data and information in their comments , are always literal , do n't blow things out of proportions etc etc etc. 
  just watched his interview . 
  it has nothing to do with ww2 and garnering sympathy for * greece * , it was a figure of speech . 
  the actual comment was :  when someone gets here he gets struck from what he sees happening or from what they describe is happening [ * context : * that minister is blind ] and i dare liken the camps to a modern/contemporary dachau . 
  if he 's garnering sympathy for someone , it 's not the greek people or the state , but the immigrants . 
  now even though i have n't seen the camps in idomeni , i seriously doubt it 's nowhere near comparable to nazi concentration camps . 
  however let 's not take everything literally here , he 's just using it as a figure of speech . 
  wait , are you talking about the greek flag ? 
  because if you are , how does [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_the_united_states ) look anything like [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_greece ) ? 
  if you 're not , terribly sorry , carry on . 
  that 's close to pgdm for the rest of you non greek ( barbarian :p ) speakers . 
  edit : sorry , it 's already been said below . 
  ** 18 ) people who * think * they can fix their own sink . 
  ** i see lots of water on the walls in my apt below my father 's . 
  we go on endless debates on whether it 's his bathtab leaking or a broken drain pipe . 
  he suggests breaking the bathtab and looking for the leak . 
  i suggest some kind of uv reactive liquid as a spill test . 
  his way is way too destructive , my way takes way too long . 
  we gave up and brought a plumber . 
  after half an hour of examining , his first question : did you replace a tap here ? 
  father had replaced a tap two months ago , did n't put enough of the ropy insulation thingy between the tap and the pipe ... mere drops of water every dayfor 2 months was enough to promote what looked like a waterfall in my walls . 
  so yeah , people who * think * they can fix their own sink ... 
  i doubt it were greeks . 
  no greek would refer to fyrom as macedonia . 
   c ) in your opinion , how transparent are the european institutions as public institutions ? 
  that 's to what i was referring to , in case that i was n't clear . 
  what about power ? 
  will they run on good will or the force ? 
  what about when they tangle ? 
  or do you think that they 'll behave on rough seas ? 
  what about the fishermen ? 
  would they be privy on the opening and closing of the `` gates '' ? 
  how many of them would we put there ? 
  say every 10km ? 
  that 's 80 gates . 
  what would happen on the most commonly traveled ones ? 
  have you ever been in a port ? 
  or more accurately , waiting * outside * the port on a ferry waiting for the traffic to clear ? 
  if it happens on huge ports like piraeus can you imagine what would happen if you restrict the flow to a couple of meters per km on open seas ? 
  how about the people crashing on the things and sinking ? 
  or why do you even think that these will be effective vs floating plastic boats . 
  go overboard , lift the raft , pass it above the floaters , reclimb the boat and be on your way . 
  immigrants do n't use speed crafts nor will they ram the things . 
  how about the sea-life ? 
  never mind the cost of procurement , how about the maintenance cost ? 
  when they paid $ 12m to house 8k people , do you suddently think that they 'll pay us billions just to maintain 800km of floating wire ? 
  unimaginative ? 
  dude , quit watching so much tv . 
  yes , we 're bursting with transparency . 
  commission , council of the eu and european council ttip ( or the debt ) talks were all about transparency . 
  ecb mandates and court of auditors ? 
  all about transparency . 
  that 's 5 out of 7 . 
  the only transparent institution is the parliament . 
  and you know how influential they are . 
  but ... we have the transparency register ... it says so right under the `` are eu institutions transparent '' question ... 
  gates ? 
  in the water ? 
  that can fit say [ 30m width ferries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mv_festos_palace ) ? 
  multiple of them ? 
  ( ferries * and * gates ) since we 're talking scifi , how about we build a spaceship and launch those immigrants to say alpha centauri to colonize ? 
  i suggest we build some kind of large wooden animal , staff the immigrants in there and gift those animals to turkey . 
  they wo n't see it coming . 
  as soon as they see a greek patrol ship they abandon their rafts . 
  ** united nations convention on the law of the sea ** article 98 duty to render assistance every state shall require the master of a ship flying its flag , in so far as he can do so without serious danger to the ship , the crew or the passengers : ( a ) to render assistance to any person found at sea in danger of being lost ; ( b ) to proceed with all possible speed to the rescue of persons in distress , if informed of their need of assistance , in so far as such action may reasonably be expected of him ; ( c ) after a collision , to render assistance to the other ship , its crew and its passengers and , where possible , to inform the other ship of the name of his own ship , its port of registry and the nearest port at which it will call . 
  that article was from last year and it was about greece been thrown out of the eurozone . 
  and you might want to read a more unbiased source , i 'll translate it for you ( and put the exact statement as well if you do n't trust my translation ) . 
  if we are expelled or forced out of the ez then waves of refugees without papers , including radical elements will flood from turkey towards the heart of the west . 
  -- the conclusion is yours to make . 
   totally harmless wasted bacon ... harmless ? 
  ** heretic . 
  because registering the immigrants is the solution .
