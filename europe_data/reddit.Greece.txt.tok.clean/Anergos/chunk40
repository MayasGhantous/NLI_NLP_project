  will registration cut down on the number of arrivals ? 
  that 's scapegoating , things are going to hell and people start the blame game , and currently there is n't an easier target than greece . 
  want to talk about acting like `` a country with eu external border '' ? 
  - oy europe , [ turkey violated greek airspace 2000 times during ' 14 ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2015/11/26/turkish-jets-violated-greek-airspace-over-2000-times-last-year-infographic/#12cb2e0c75c3 ) . 
  we do n't care , it 's * your * border . 
  - oy europe , [ turkish special forces erected turkish flag on our island ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imia/kardak ) . 
  we do n't care , it 's * your * island . 
  and suddenly - greece , why are n't you guarding your borders and islands ? 
  it 's eu borders as well you know !, 
  orly ? 
  if you 're looking for replacements , give us a call . 
  does translation , gets downvoted because people do n't agree with what the original text said . 
  it 's a bit long but the summary ( or the important facts anyway ) : greek foreign minister recalls their ambassador from austria . 
  he says that the large problems of eu can not be solved by 19th century tactics nor can decisions of country leaders be dictated by police directors . 
  the unilateral decisions taken as well as the infringement of international law will undermine the eu foundations . 
  the responsibility of dealing with this crisis can not fall into the hands of one nation only . 
  logic dictates that in order to solve the problem effectively there should be an equal and fair distribution of weight/responsibility . 
  many people keep saying close the borders greece . 
  you * ca n't * close sea borders . 
  it 's been said multiple times already . 
  1 ) there are laws governing what can and ca n't be done on international waters . 
  2 ) we can not put ships there because that would cause an incident with turkey . 
  and even if we could 3 ) we can not return immigrants to turkey because that would mean * us * getting into * their * territory . 
  there 's no amount of will or money that can fix this unless turkey is also on-board . 
  and turkey will * never * be onboard on having greek navy patrolling 1.5 km off of their coasts . 
  no matter how much you 're going to pay them . 
  and even if you get turkey to play along and have * them * patrol those waters , no amount of money will make * us * allow turkey to have their navy 1.5 km off of our islands . 
  plus , they 're not stupid , why would they get stuck with the immigrants ? 
  they 'll pocket the money and maybe accept a couple of hundred back just of appearances sake . 
   neither of these things are happening . 
  ever . 
   a ) turkey would have to accept migrants back on their land , you ca n't force them . 
  [ nato launches naval patrols to return migrants to turkey ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/11/nato-launches-naval-patrols-to-return-migrants-to-turkey ) . 
   if you want the problem solved , you 're gon na have to take matters into your own hands . 
  do n't expect other countries to solve it for you , like your solutions suggest . 
  because the solution is not in our hands . 
  we ca n't guard our coastal borders with turkey with any effectiveness , because that would lead to an episode . 
  that 's why nato is intervening and no greek/turkish ships are used in the patrol . 
  because we are n't the immigrants destination country and we ca n't tell them that they 're not welcome . 
  because we have no say on what happens in syria , we 're taking no part on bombings or operations there . 
  because our hands are tied financially to such a degree that we ca n't hire people to help deal with the situation . 
  do you want me to continue ? 
  because if i live in an environment where i do not have the chance to exercise that language , after some years the knowledge will fade . 
  i love french . 
  took a couple of low level degrees as well . 
  have n't spoken french in 10 + years . 
  at most i can translate some written text if it 's simple enough . 
  yes i can probably get into it much faster now , but that 's about it . 
  started learning chinese . 
  spend about a year or so , it ca n't be more than 4-5 years ago . 
  i understand more japanese simply because i am a kurosawa fan , and i 've watched initial-d and akira 50 times . 
  illegal no , but is n't there you know , rules about not using your cellphone at school or something ? 
  i 'm pretty old by reddit standards and we did n't have them back then . 
  the only way out of this situation for us is ( but not really for turkey ) : a ) nato ships excluding ours and turkey 's patrolling the waters and returning them to turkish land . 
  the initiative has already been approved and three ships are on their way , but three ships are not enough . 
  then b ) distributing or repatriating the existing ones . 
  they were n't expelled because they insulted erdo\u011fan but because they were using cellphones in the school premises . 
  or something . 
  that 's how * i * would cover it up if i were the headmaster of the school . 
   the day is see 2 nato countries in war with each other quite distant . 
  which one is the us going to bomb , turkey or greece ? 
  this shows how distanced you are from the realities here . 
  twice in the past we have been at a brink of conflict . 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek%e2%80%93turkish_relations#incidents ) , check the timeline at 1987 and 1995 . 
  we are both nato countries since 1952 . 
  but fuck it , you know better . 
  take a look at a [ map ] ( http://alabamamaps.ua.edu/contemporarymaps/world/europe/europe4c.jpg ) , right ? 
  compare the borders between finland/russia and greece/turkey , right ? 
  see anything different ? 
  yeah we have all that blue thing between us . 
  that blue thing is called `` the sea '' . 
  that 's where all the immigrants are coming from . 
  now granted i 'm not that smart but how does one closes a sea border ? 
  we could n't build a fence , right ? 
  i mean the sea is wet and all , how do you build a fence there ? 
  same problem with a wall . 
  now we could bring all our ships and form a wall that way , right ? 
  it 's like themistocles said , but instead of wooden wall ( triremes ) , it 'll be metal ( cruisers and such ) . 
  the problem is , turkey does n't like our ships that much , probably because our seamen do n't wash or something , and they prefer our ships not that close to their homeland , right ? 
  so how exactly do we `` close '' that border then ? 
  say fuck you turks , we 're putting our ships here whether our seamen smell or not ? 
  will your government offer support in case of hostilities then ? 
  or will it do , what all of you done twice in the past and tell us to fuck off and figure it out ourselves ? 
  i think we have a pretty good idea what border control is . 
  but we also have a pretty good idea that you 'll pussy out if we were to exert any actual control over those seas . 
  so why the fuck should we risk war then ? 
  just because it 's an `` inconvenience '' to you ? 
  i 'm going to quote part of another post i made here  now say that we 'll be vigilant and send all our frigates to patrol those waters . 
  what would happen then ? 
  turkey ai n't gon na like it , that 's for certain . 
  they 'll sent theirs as well . 
  we 'll be on the blink of a conflict . 
  and say we have the balls to do that . 
  will your government support us then ? 
  shit no . 
   you see we have experience in this already . 
  twice from my knowledge ( 1987 and 1996 ) just from what i remember at the moment . 
  did our `` allies '' help us then ? 
  `` nothing '' by eu standards . 
  will eu let us hire more patrolmen ?
