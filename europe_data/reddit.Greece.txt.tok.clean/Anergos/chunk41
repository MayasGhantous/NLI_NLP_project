  do you know how many people are getting hired to help with the situation ? 
  ** 49 ** and i 'm certain that this was done by bending the rules of the bailout . 
  did you hear the creditors coming and saying , oy mate , how about i lessen the restrictions so you can deal with the situation a bit better ? 
  now i 'm certain someone will reply that , hey , you 're getting eu moneys , use that . 
  yeah , like those $ 12m to house 8000 people . 
  on an island . 
  with not enough power , water and waste disposal to handle just the local people . 
  how about sending a couple of $ b to us too , man ? 
  see it 's hypocritical . 
  the same people that hold the leash on our budget moan about us not doing anything about the immigrants . 
  i mean , we barely scrape by for ourselves and they expect us to be able to cope with this shit on the same budget ? 
  no , we 're not , but what do they care ? 
  leave the borders closed , it 's their prerogative . 
  let me check something really quick , right ? 
   border \u02c8b\u0254\u02d0d\u0259 / noun noun : border ; plural noun : borders  a line separating two countries , administrative divisions , or other areas . 
  now take a look [ at this ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/images/schengen-map/map.jpg ) . 
  do you see a line that separates two schengen countries with one of them being greece ? 
  is there any `` blue '' country that has the same borders with us ? 
  leaving greece by land , whichever direction you take requires a passport . 
  now that we have this out of the way , i 'll be a total jerk and invite downvotes but screw it , since we 've been treated like shit anyway on this matter . 
  when you 're already in a country and want to get in the neighbouring country , who bears the most responsibility to do control checks ? 
  the country you 're leaving * from * or the country you 're entering * into * ? 
  well , since we 're not east germany in the 60 's it 's pretty evident , right ? 
  we are to blame for border controls , it 's not our northern border you 'll need to blame us for , but our east border . 
  the red line between us and turkey on the east [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pzj2ee9.jpg ) . 
  now say that we 'll be vigilant and send all our frigates to patrol those waters . 
  what would happen then ? 
  turkey ai n't gon na like it , that 's for certain . 
  they 'll sent theirs as well . 
  we 'll be on the blink of a conflict . 
  and say we have the balls to do that . 
  will * your * government support us then ? 
  ** shit no ** . 
  you see we have experience in this already . 
  twice from my knowledge ( 1987 and 1996 ) just from what i remember at the moment . 
  did our `` allies '' help us then ? 
  but fret not , nato is taking action in this matter . 
  since we ca n't have our ships ( nor turkey 's ) patrol those waters , nato will be sending three ships . 
  so instead of moaning about schengen borders and issuing ultimatums , how about you neutral ( non greek/turkey ) countries send more ships ? 
  fuck , let it be d-day there , every mile a cruiser or something . 
  we wo n't mind . 
  as long as it 's not turkish ships that is . 
  no man , no . 
  listen . 
  we were pretty happy , we simply had planes ( over the water ) , ships ( on the water ) and subs ( surface but under the water ) . 
  then some french dude thought , you know what would be great ? 
  planes that land on water !, 
  ok , seaplanes were then born . 
  right ? 
  ok , not much more complex , i get it . 
  then some bloke said , man , why do we need seaplanes when we have ships * and * planes ? 
  why not land planes on the ship ? 
  so yeah , as if it were n't enough , aircraft carriers were born . 
  then another bastard - as if things were n't complex enough said , what about a ship that can travel ... on land man . . by flying ? 
  so hovercraft was born . 
  probably at the same time that another dude had a brilliant idea of a * car * that can travel in water . 
  and went ahead and called it amphibious . 
  i mean it 's alright by me , i already speak greek , but why not call it reverse hovercraft or something man . 
  and now you 're telling me you 've created a ship that 's half a submarine ? 
  no man , that 's enough . 
  [ i mean look at it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zumwalt-class_destroyer#/media/file:dd%28x%29.png ) . 
  why is it called a ship ? 
  it looks exactly like a [ submarine ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/c4/b3/ed/c4b3edebb92676be0001189fea57f009.jpg ) . 
  why ca n't it dive ? 
  think of the kids man . 
  they 'll go and buy a toy zumwalt , they 'll bring it to their pool , or if they 're dirt poor like me in their bathtub , and they 'll expect this thing to be able to dive . 
  write to your congressman man , tell him to either make it a sub or a ship . 
  not both . 
  and for god 's sake , you know , you have elmo r. `` bud '' zumwalt jr. . you can name it elmo . 
  junior . 
  great names , right ? 
  nah , fuck it , let 's name it zumwalt . 
  i mean , that 's like whale something in german , do you want a destroyer named `` to the whale '' ? 
  ------- on a more serious note , that 's mostly for radar purposes though . 
  i do n't think there are other practical reasons for her hull to be under water . 
  yeah , i think it 's to lower the radar profile or something . 
  if you think * that 's * interesting , wait till you year her captain 's name ... james ... kirk . . dude would be better off serving as the captain of a [ certain carrier ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uss_enterprise_%28cvn-65%29 ) had it been active though . 
  ( \u03c3\u03cd\u03bc\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd / sympan ) universe is the total of what was , is and will be . 
  ( \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 / cosmos ) world ( based on the verb \u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03bc\u03ce , beautify/ornament ) is the organized structure of being ( which was considered `` beautiful '' ) . 
  it can also refer to people for that reason . 
  and here lies the confusion . 
  we do use those two words concurrently , universe with world . 
  but as i said , world ( cosmos ) is also used to portray `` people '' . 
  and since people are still stuck on earth , cosmos can mean universe , world and earth ( in a sense ) . 
  it depends on the gravity of earth ( hehe :p ) in the conversation . 
  do n't carry much cash with you , get a budget phone for your vacations , leave your valuables you do n't want missing ( papers etc ) at the hotel , done . 
  do n't even carry a wallet , spare change in one pocket , credit card in the other one . 
  edit : that for your walks of course . 
  for longer trips , you 'll need id so you 'll have to improvise . 
  yeah . 
  though not a really a great comparison , since the first ship is capsized . 
  not a great sight though even when [ straight ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wrahq5u.jpg ) . 
  that 's not a ship , that 's a boat . 
  ( still active as a museum btw ) . 
  [ this ] ( http://tpwd.texas.gov/state-parks/battleship-texas/gallery/bstx_2954.jpg ) is a ship . 
  or [ this ] ( http://www.hmsbarfleur.co.uk/king%20george%20v1.jpg ) . 
  or [ this ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/05/26/article-1391220-0c469d0000000578-848_468x409.jpg ) monstrosity . 
  those were the days :p, 
  refunds , no . 
  take the next best offer ( or actual value from experts ) , make them return the difference plus some kind of punitive damage , say free support for those weapon platforms for x years .
