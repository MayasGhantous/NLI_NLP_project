  needless to day that those involved should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law . 
  building in the mainland is cheap . 
  build on the islands ? 
  sheeet , transportation costs alone would probably cost more than the construction . 
  water ? 
  waste processing ? 
  electricity ? 
  heck , on some islands there are blackouts during the summer because there 's not enough power . 
  imagine having twice the population ... 
  so , 12mil for housing 8k people ? 
  say we cram 8 people on each `` housing '' unit , that 's $ 10k for each unit . 
  yeah ... for reference a new shipping container goes for ~ $ 5k . 
  without fancy things like insulation , power etc. 
  or transportation costs ... yeah , colour me unimpressed . 
  yes , damages . 
  siemens scandal brought about ~ 2b euros in damages . 
  siemens settlement was ~ 330million during 2012 . 
  of which 80million was money still owed to siemens , essentially debt write-off for work completed ... on projects they got by bribing . 
  paying 90 millions in gear for infrastructure , investing 100 million euros in its greek branch , siemens hellas , and spending another 60 million euros to build a new factory in greece . 
  factory that has not yet been built ( nor any actions taken to be built as far as we can see ) . 
  bear in mind that bribes reached and surpassed 100million euros , just as a comparison . 
  so yeah , i would n't hold my breath on that . 
  nah , i do n't have a gripe with anyone . 
  maybe i 'm a bit disappointed with our neighbours turkey , since even after 300y of occupation , one would have thought that their stance would n't be that aggressive towards us . 
  well , a bit with uk and russia , you know , for their part in our civil war . 
  just after wwii we were a bit vulnerable and well , uk did n't want russia to find a communist ally in greece , so they kinda , you know helped one side . 
  russia on the other hand kinda `` helped '' the other side . 
  hm , just a tad with the us , for their part in the military junta , you know , for right * after * our civil war . 
  but nothing major really . 
  slightly disappointed in some of our eu allies for their treatment in the debt issues - not that it was not understandable or anything . 
  but maybe a bit too harsh . 
  then ... you know , the migrant issue came , not great timing either , i feel we were somewhat mistreated . 
  not anything terrible mind you , but with the issue of the debt on one hand i would have expected some leniency . 
  i would also state something about nato but that would just be mean . 
  all in all , pretty happy with all of you chaps . 
  we are finally a totally independent and sovereign nation and not pawns of other powers . 
  interest rate \u2260 debt your quote :  you do realize that greece is not paying any debt for at least 30 years on those loans , do you ? 
  which is wrong . 
  if you want to amend it to saying : `` you do realize that greece is not paying any interest rate on * some * of the loans for x years , do you ? '', 
  then you 'd be correct . 
  but it 's one thing to claim `` greece does not have to pay anything '' , and another thing to claim `` greece does n't have to pay a part of one of the loans '' . 
  feel the difference ? 
  not only that . 
  but the  they would initially allow lower interest rates and longer maturities on greece 's 316-billion-euro ( $ 352 billion ) debt , the paper said . 
  at a later stage , there would be talks on linking debt payments to economic growth provided athens implemented measures to be agreed with creditors by 2022 , it added . 
  is purely speculation . 
  no talks have taken place nor will take place till the review of the `` new '' bailout takes place . 
  also linking debt repayment to economic growth was one of the positions of our `` negotiating team '' and was shot down completely . 
  only talks about debt restructuring * might * take place and that was not even in writing , simply a promise that it will be looked into as a viable solution after the review takes place . 
  and while many would think that the aforementioned solution does seem like a good way out , i would claim it 's * too * good . 
  as things stand there 's no reason to give in that much . 
  they 'll do what they 've always done . 
  kick the can down the road . 
  find a solution that is the least hurting to their political agendas , a solution that deals with the * now * and let the next politicians deal with the problem when it arises again . 
  it 's one thing not paying any ( or paying a small ) rate on the loan . 
  it 's another `` not paying any debt '' . 
  [ we do and will continue to pay for the loans every year ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03179/greecedebtschedule_3179326c.jpg ) till at least 2057 . 
  they promised a debt restructuring after the first review of the `` new '' bailout program , but till then there 's no change on the debt repayment schedule . 
  they 're taking their sweet time with the review of the `` new '' bailout program . 
  it was supposed to start october , it started february and they even broke it into two parts ... the second to be completed in `` spring '' , aka you know , september or something . 
  i do n't know who 's to blame , but if it 's us , that 's the stupidest thing we could do . 
  time is running out , there 's this `` promise '' of debt restructuring after the review . 
  as time goes by , things are getting worse . 
  ** way worse ** . 
  we need to conclude this review asap and head into debt restructuring talks yesterday . 
  i would assume that his stance would be tough * exactly * because he 's pro-eu . 
  he has the support of the pro-eu brits anyway in this matter , it was a great opportunity to gain the support of the rest of you fellows or the in-betweens . 
  granted i 'm no expert in politics but that 's what i figure . 
  from what i can tell , he got everything he asked but for different amounts of time . 
  he wanted freeze to in-work benefits of eu citizens in uk . 
  he got it for all new arrivals . 
  that 's the largest concession he gave from what i understand . 
  keeping the privileges she enjoys for 7 more years instead of 12 . 
  indexing the benefits of children outside uk to the cost of living starting from new workers . 
  all workers from 2020 . 
  ( so essentially a 4y delay for the existing ones ) . 
  he basically got `` the protection of non-eu vs eu countries '' more or less he demanded . 
  he even got them to reword the treaty 's political integration `` message '' as to not include uk in it . 
  i mean , considering when you 're heading for negotiations , your starting position is always `` better '' that what you hope to achieve , how 's that not a great victory for him ? 
  come now , does it * always * have to regress to that ? 
  so , let me help you get it out of your system , so we can have a different conversation this time : yes , we borrowed money we could n't afford , yes we misspent it , yes we lied . 
  on , to the present matter . 
  ideologically , each country should be treated * the same * . 
  we do n't make special rules for special countries . 
  in an equal membership union , we do n't treat members differently . 
  however in the real world , i understand that it 's impossible . 
  but at least * try * to have a decorum . 
  you ca n't issue ultimatums every month to one member , have a totally rigid stance on everything but for a different member , compromise on everything . 
  i mean of course uk is a big player , of course they have better negotiation positions , but * come on * . 
  that 's not even trying ... 
  oh , wait , do n't get me wrong . 
  i 'm all for a country getting the best deal they can get . 
  i 'm not mad at the brits , on the contrary . 
  they had the balls to get a deal that suited them , props to them . 
  ** edit : ** unless you think that it 's not a great deal for uk , in which case , i need to do some more reading ... 
  that 's another great example of eu solidarity , for all of you skeptics out there . 
  first they unanimously agree to f *** greece , then they unanimously agree to get f *** ed by uk . 
  the migrant issue still remains but if germany changes her tune , then we 'll be back to unanimously beating the dead horse . 
  then only russia will remain as a problem . 
  we 'll find a unanimous solution for that too , preferably one that f * ks a small country , ukraine maybe ?
