  you know , with all the debt and all , it seems a prime target . 
  i am not certain about the definition of a `` metro '' system . 
  [ wikipedia listing about it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/athens%e2%80%93piraeus_electric_railways ) :  opened as a suburban railway line connecting athens with the nearby major port city of piraeus , it was gradually converted to full rapid transit operations , making it one of the oldest metro lines in the world . 
  if you were to ask me , i 'd say our metro system is pretty new ... but that 's about the actual , going underground train thingy . 
  if simply having electricity based trains that have many stops at close intervals and have many trips per day * inside the city * ( metro-whatever definition ) , then , yeah , it 's pretty old . 
  ** we 're talking about attack dogs . 
  ** not fences . 
  not even chained guard dogs . 
  we 're talking unleashing attack dogs on human beings . 
  now you can hide behind the analog all you want . 
  you can use excuses/arguments like burglars and protect your property all you want . 
  unleashing attack dogs on human beings that have no intent on hurting you is sick . 
  do you know a lot of immigrants wanting to stay in fyrom ? 
  what is the intent of the refugees ? 
  breaking into your home , stealing your stuff and possibly doing harm to you ? 
  or simply trespassing through your property ? 
  how is it more correct to claim refugees are thieves intent on hurting you than mere trespassers ? 
  i do n't get you people ... 
  no , it 's not . 
  however , if your house is next to a playground , and you get an attack dog to ward off children that are trying to retrieve their balls , you 're being a dick . 
  yes , it 's within your rights to do so , yes it 's annoying that all those damn children messing up your lawn , but that 's taking it to extremes . 
  that to answer your analog/simile . 
  as far as the article is concerned , they * should * use dogs if it helps tracking down illegals , but for god 's sake , not unleash them . 
  let 's try to maintain a level of dignity here . 
  in athens quite a lot . 
  in smaller cities , not much . 
  but in athens , it 's a problem honestly and i do n't understand why . 
  ok , the rash to do something beyond the law etc , but heck man , you live in these parts . 
  why would anyone want to degenerate the neighbourhood he lives in ? 
  anyway , i do not keep my opinion on tagging to myself , it 's a disgrace . 
  if you want to tag a wall , tag your living room you little shit . 
  unless you 're * good * at it and you 're doing it on a long boring concrete wall . 
  yeah . 
  that , or someone actually gets informed , you know , by watching the news ? 
  for instance , [ 5 months ago ] ( http://www.protothema.gr/greece/article/505499/ploio-opla-/ ) , a container full of weapons was caught again in greece . 
  5000 weapons and 500000 bullets ? 
  that was caught . 
  now imagine , how many get through . 
  so yeah , compared to that , it was amateur hour . 
  oh no , editorializing and twisting the truth in order to make the article more appealing ? 
  how dare they ? 
  what world are we living in ... and just to acknowledge that it 's not just the author 's fault , how much interested would * you * have been if the article simply read `` kurds with british passports caught trying to smuggle weapons through debt country ? 
  hmmmm ? 
  on to the meat of the article , i am surprised there 's weapon 's smuggling on land routes still ... though it 's pretty minor all things considered , 20 weapons and some thousand bullets , screams amateur hour . 
  ** greece ** 1 . 
  medical tests . 
  pretty standard fare , pathologist and x-ray , eyes and somesuch . 
  21 hours of theoretical training at a driving school . 
  35 hours practical training at a driving school . 
  theoretical test . 
  two wrong answers is failure . 
  practical test . 
  mostly up to the two examiners . 
  they may fail you if you forgot to check the tire pressure or `` fix '' the mirrors , or be more forgiving . 
  that 's if i remember correctly . 
  ------ edit : small story for those who are bored : ( many years ago ) i passed the theoretical test with the first try . 
  failed the 1st practical test because the examiners were assho ... were not decent human beings . 
  apparently '' [ continue straight ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qlsyt8j.jpg ) '' is the green arrow and not the red , as i interpreted the green arrow being `` across '' since it was a two way street . 
  they wanted me to make a 180 on that two way street because we were going out of their `` jurisdiction '' . 
  i refused citing the law . 
  they then made me go through a [ local market ] ( https://www.alfavita.gr/sites/default/files/laikhagora.jpg ) crouded with people . 
  they then proceeded to shout to me , go more to the right as i was `` touching '' the other lane . 
  there was no other lane , the road was like 4m wide even without all the carts . 
  i warned them that i would touch the mirrors of the parked cars ( we were going ~ 2-3km / h ) . 
  they said to go more to the right or i fail . 
  i warned them - again that there was no space , and that i would touch the mirrors . 
  they - again - shouted at me to go more the right . 
  i went . 
  i touched the mirrors . 
  i failed . 
  made an appeal the same day . 
  got retested by the head honcho the next day . 
  the test took 3 minutes . 
  right outside the testing center just after we started , the director ( the dude testing me ) told me he forgot the file . 
  so he asked me to do 180 on a shitty dead end , the width of the road was n't that much larger than the car . 
  my instructor started objecting because that was way beyond the difficulty of test . 
  the director said that he would n't take it into consideration and that that was n't a test - he just wanted to go back and get the files so that we could start the test . 
  i could take as many manoeuvres as i needed . 
  he lied . 
  we returned to the training center , he fetched his file , had my instructor sign and sent me on my way . 
  so yeah , a nice bit of story there . 
  now i understand where all that happiness comes from ... 
  i do not understand the problem . 
  if the law states he should be tried , let him be tried . 
  you have perfectly ( i assume ) capable court officers who will take in to account every mitigating factor , be it his age , the small amount of time he actually served in auschwitz or whatever else . 
   ... religious or ** commercial ** messages [ what ? 
  ] ( http://i1.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article6129031.ece/alternates/s1227b/manchester-city-vs-real-madrid.jpg ), 
  same with greek , albeit we have even less countries that * do not * end with `` a '' . 
  from the top of my head only montenegro , belgium and cyprus do not end with an `` a '' in europe . 
  from the 40500 searches for the benz in greece , 40400 were mine . 
  try finding a hand rest for a 1996 c class 180 that wo n't cost more than the whole f * king car . 
  hey , if that means they get our debt , it 's fine by me . 
  ^ ^ plus ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ not ^ ^ really ^ ^ our ^ ^ country 's ^ ^ name ^ ^ anyway ... 
  while i am not exactly what you call a naval expert , i would think that if the greek coast guard wanted to sink that raft , they would simply cruise close to it at fast speeds and let the wake take care of it . 
  plus now , let 's be reasonable , the coast guard knew about the turkish boat near them . 
  how stupid do you have to be to do such a thing in plain view of another boat where you know they 'll be filming ? 
  the greek climate is different from those * other * places , very healthy , very similar to the russian climate ( wink-wink ) . 
  fyrom is not a schengen country . 
  if they wanted to guard actual schengen borders , then they should guard slovenia / hungary southern borders or greek eastern borders . 
  greece does not border any schengen country to the north , the borders they want to `` guard '' .
