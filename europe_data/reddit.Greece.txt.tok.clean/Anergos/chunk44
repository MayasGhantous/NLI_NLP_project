  the problem is they 're not working on multiple fronts at the same time . 
  they 're pushing for a solution on the greek front * now * but there 's no solution for the other fronts in sight . 
  and if countries ca n't agree on the refugee quotas * now * , that they 're under pressure from the refugee waves , what happens if we , by some miracle , start managing to keep refugees from exiting greece ? 
  what 's the incentive to take up refugees then ? 
  the threat that greece will allow them to leave once again ? 
  empty threat - eu has greece by the balls on multiple fronts . 
  plus then it 'll be greece the bad guy again , who 's blackmailing the other `` noble '' eu countries . 
  that 's the hypocrisy that 's running the eu circles . 
  they deem the greek behavior unacceptable , so much so that they threaten schengen exclusion , but where are the penalties to countries who are not negotiating/accepting the quotas ? 
  stupidity from both sides . 
  why so much emphasis on the greek northern border ffs . 
  it 's like you have a leak on your water faucet and instead of fixing the leak , you 're concerned about how to block your water drain better ... 
  the problem is not to the north people , the problem lies to the east . 
  not from where the refugees are getting out , but from where they 're coming in ... i mean technically greece is still in the eu , so should n't we , i do n't know , concern ourselves more with people getting * in * than people getting * out * ? 
  but hey , they brib . . er . . gave $ 2b for that , so it 's all good , right ? 
  from the greek side , yeah , indecisiveness , amateurism and so on . 
  though it 's somewhat to be expected , we do have already too much on our plate ( not that we could n't do better though ) . 
   that 's already part of the deal . 
  when did that happen ? 
  the deal they struck during summer listed no changes in the payment regime . 
   that has been shown to be problematic without political support . 
  thats ' why the fm ( ergo the government ) will also take place in that committee . 
   that 's not something that governments have control over . 
  in communist countries maybe , up to a point , but not in european countries . 
  of course that 's something the governments have control over . 
  schr\u00f6der did it with his agenta 2010 . 
  obama will do it with his overtime rule . 
  there are plenty ways that the govt can affect the wages in the country , you do n't need to have a communist govt ...  and increases imports does not mean that those imports are going to come from greece . 
  i am not talking increasing imports from greece . 
  i am talking about balancing the productivity between eu countries so that other markets can be more competitive . 
  i wanted to include prominent cultural icons . 
  plus i am pretty certain there are paok fans in athens as well . 
  x years no loan payments , incur penalties if greece goes on `` spending spree '' . 
  create a committee of technocrats , with knowledge of both the economic and social background in greece along with the fm + aids for asset handling/privatizations . 
  later tie debt repayment to growth for a couple of decades till the situation is viable . 
  allow greece to partake in the qe , swap the damn banks bad collateral at a decent rate and stop the cc already . 
  increase the wages in * some * countries in the eu , relax the exports and increase the imports a bit to boost productivity across the rest of the countries . 
  and eat more feta . 
  well , at least you still have the sandwich . 
  i remember catching a british show , yes minister / yes prime minister . 
  it was comedy of course but some of the things they based their satire on where * probably * true . 
  things like , being easier for a foreign person to get into some universities that native brits due to government grants or whatever . 
  googled cost of a sidewinder missile . 
  ~ $ 600k/unit . 
  yeah , we 're not going to be shooting down planes any time soon . 
  i do n't really understand the point . 
  he did n't procure a license/building permit for his building , does it matter that it 's a mock castle ? 
  if it were a shack , would the court order be any different ? 
  unless of course he tried to get a license and got turned down * because * of the `` design '' , i fail to see the newsworthiness of the article . 
  `` building condemned because of no building permit '' is n't exactly newsworthy . 
  funny how much of an impression das boot has made . 
  brilliant strategy . 
  let 's express anger against facebook by buying their products . 
  -- anybody wants to be angry at a greek ? 
  i can sell you some flags to burn and i also promise not to pay any tax on the sale !, 
  200-300k people made all the difference in the elections . 
  florida and pennsylvania ( and wisconsin to a lesser effect ) . 
  1 % vote difference in those states made this possible . 
  anyway , first the brexit and then this . 
  glad i am not a betting man . 
   greek village name ... ... in macedonia ? 
  not * that * part of macedonia . 
  the slavic part . 
  the actual name is '' \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0441 '' . 
  search for ** '' ** blue mosque ** '' ** instead of blue mosque and ** '' ** hagia sophia ** '' ** instead of hagia sophia . 
  that 's searching for the phrase between '' '' exactly . 
  you 'll get 1m results for the first one vs 5m results for the second one . 
  we 're seeing what is seemingly a hard eu stance agaist the british on the subject of brexit . 
  do you think that this will impact any future greek debt negotiations with our partners ? 
  does this stance mean that leaving the ez is n't that great of a bargaining chip any longer ? 
  the majority of greeks are service providers ( [ 82.8 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_greece ) ) . 
  those do not scale with advancements in technology , miniaturization etc. 
  in other words , comparing the `` worker productivity '' between different economies is bullshit . 
  of course for instance germany has higher worker productivity . 
  they make cars . 
  they invent new ways to make making cars more efficiently . 
  people in the world buy more cars . 
  so as time goes by , productivity increases . 
  how is a greek person gon na increase their productivity ? 
  sell more salads ? 
  funny since in greek the `` phoric '' part means he who carries/owns/holds ( eu / \u03b5\u03c5 / ef = well being ) so , it 's he who carries the eu . 
  nonono , forget about translators . 
  it 's about children who can somewhat speak english . 
  if there were talks about translators to say arabic then there would n't be any reason to do the classes in english . 
   are there so many greek teachers of maths , litterature , science etc that speak fluently english ? 
  apart from the `` old guard '' , i doubt anyone with a degree is not able to speak english . 
  might not be * fluently * but proficiency would come easily with practice . 
  ok , so you extracted `` haploid '' information from a statue bust and used to to compare it to contemporary greeks ? 
  that 's your proof ? 
  then allow me to continue on this thought and educate you about the [ quality of those who claimed that `` fact ] ( http://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2015/06/14/greeks-are-not-real-greeks-claims-german-welt-favoring-a-dna-based-eu-membership/ ) '' and their `` scientific '' approach to that claim . 
  and pray tell then , of what relevance - even if your claim is true - has this tidbit of information has on my comment or this thread in general ? 
  well we do n't walk the streets in chitons , are n't paedofiles and we treat our women - slightly - better . 
  nah , he 's one of those people who thinks that just because we live in the same geographic area , speak the same language and even keep some of the old customs , we are not `` really '' descendants of the ancient greeks . 
  so by extension - not that he 'd admit that - we should n't be proud nor take credit for what * those * greeks did . 
  probably something along those lines . 
  euripides said , it 's logical for greeks to command barbarians , but not the other way around . 
  plato said i owe luck three things : i was born a human not an animal , a male not a female and a greek not a barbarian . 
  so the distinction was not one of the language , but of heritage . 
  actually everything non greek is ... barbarian ( not derogatory ) . 
  that 's the definition .
