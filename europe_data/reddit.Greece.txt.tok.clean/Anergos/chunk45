  so ... yeah, 
   they are an illegal immigrant and may be detained and sent back to their home country . 
  and which is their home country ? 
  how exactly can you tell ? 
  see , that 's the problem with having an opinion without doing some trivial research first . 
  they carry no papers . 
  they lie about their country of origin . 
  there is no way to determine which country they are from and simply speaking - or not speaking - a language is not enough to legaly determine it . 
  when eu forced additional frontex personel and `` better '' registering in greece 's * north * borders ( recall the whole out of schengen ultimatum ) they claimed it was not because northern countries wanted to invoke dublin regulations , but to facilitate the distribution of the refugees . 
  is it strange that now greece is finding the german plans unacceptable ? 
   technically , it is greece 's expense would you like me to list some other things that can `` technically '' happen ? 
   but it is a relatively small price to pay to keep the influx of migrants controlled and tightly regulated . 
  we got paid $ 80m to house 20k immigrants for an indefinite amount of time . 
  just as an fyi the damage done by immigrants on our rail system alone during the 4months of last summer was $ 3m . 
   economic migrants hoping to reach germany or sweden are discouraged if the offer is greece or nothing . 
  economic migrants would be discouraged if ** your ** countries started changing ** your ** laws and provisions about immigrants instead of trying to change ** other ** countries policies . 
  you do n't make the trip harder , you make the destination not worth it . 
  but that costs political capital and it 's cheaper to just blame scapegoat countries . 
   if and when the number of refugees exceeds the capability of greece to manage it has already happened . 
  imagine in a country where hospitals do n't have bandages , where 2 policemen are responsible to safeguard four towns of 10k pop each , where schools do n't have teachers , you 're forced to hire people to tend for the immigrants . 
  while at the same time being told that your public sector is bloated and you need to cut * more * . 
  but yeah , how dare greece be not happy with these plans . 
  increasing the vat by as much as 15 % , reducing pensions and sallaries across the board by 30 % + , increasing all the direct taxes as well as creating new ones etc are not societal reasons . 
  people do n't take to the streets because they do n't get free vacations . 
  they take to the streets because they got ta live on a $ 400 pension while the greek lidle 's prices are more expensive than the german ones . 
   if reducing the deficit reduces gdp , it 's because gdp is not at the level it should be and is inflated by the deficit . 
  or the way you chose to reduce the deficit is not allowing the economy to recover . 
  * actual * greek google autocomplete , depending if you search for `` british '' ( \u0392\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03af ) or `` english '' ( \u0386\u03b3\u03b3\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 ) . 
  why did the british vote for brexit and why do the english drive the wrong way, 
  http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2016/05/24-eurogroup-statement-greece/ second paragraph . 
  ** what they said last friday **  out of a total of 15 policy measures , called ` milestones ' in e.u. 
  jargon , apparently only two have been implemented so far . 
  ** what they said two months ago : ** 25/05/2016 eurogroup statement on greece  the eurogroup also welcomes the adoption by the greek parliament of most of the agreed prior actions for the first review ... and  following the eurogroup statement of 25 may 2016 and a positive assessment of the programme implementation made by the european commission in liaison with the european central bank ( ecb ) , as described in the compliance report and the approval of the board of governors of the esm , greece and the european commission signed a supplemental mou ( smou ) on 16 june 2016 . yada yada  this process leads to the disbursement of the second tranche of the esm programme , amounting to eur 10.3 bn ----- i mean our politicians are amateurs and incompetent . 
  but that 's just silly . 
  while we 're on that subject of `` upholding our end of the bargain '' , there were supposted to be talks about debt relief - er sorry mr. sch\u00e4uble i mean * restructuring * , since september/november last . 
  which was delayed till the first review started , which was delayed till the conclusion of the first review . 
  well , it 's being 3 months since the conclusion ... just saying . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/skem5bg.jpg ) looks like the aborted child of the [ arc de triomphe ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5d9pj3a.jpg ) and a [ leg cast ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1vjinv2.jpg ) from the 50 's . 
  even ignoring the materials , i mean look at it . 
  no cohesion , horizontal lines , vertical lines , radial lines , corinthian composite wannabe with a bazilion fake flutes and some kind of ionic base . 
  the rest is like they could n't make up their minds , go with a classical look , a medieval look or a cold war eastern european/russian look . 
  at least they have a [ blowjob scene being witnessed by two digletts ] ( http://i.imgur.com/e1pdxvw.png ) so there 's that ... 
  you can attribute it to either simple incompetence or premeditated malice . 
  now , which of those two describe our government better ? 
  well , just to get a job in a call center for a major airline here required 3 languages , a degree from a university and 5 years of experience ... so yeah ... you know the joke about baristas being art majors ? 
  well , ours are doctors of science . 
  the additional debt incurred was the result of the haircut . 
  the new loan was part of the haircut . 
  they decided on it when they did the haircut . 
  it was not a separate event , it was not unforeseen . 
  how can you * not * count it against the haircut ? 
  i owe you 100 bucks . 
  i pay you a fee of $ 20 to reduce my debt to $ 50 . 
  did you reduce my debt by 50 % ? 
  i 'm so tired of pointing this out ... anyway , it was * not * a 50 % debt reduction . 
  it was a 50 % haircut on * some * of the debt . 
  most of which was held by greek banks . 
  who needed a bailout after that in the form of another loan the following year . 
  the haircut amounted to 100bn , the loans given after that were 50bn , so essentially the debt was reduced by 50bn . 
  that 's it . 
  [ our gdp during 2011 and 2012 was $ 288bn and $ 246bn ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/gdp ) respectively . 
  our debt to gdp [ was 172 % and 160 % ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/government-debt-to-gdp ) for those years . 
  which means 288 x 1.72 = $ 495bn for 2011 and 246x1 .6 = $ 393bn for 2012 . 
  that 's the original 100bn haircut ( 495 - 393 ) . 
  for 2013 we have [ $ 240bn ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/gdp ) x [ 1.777 ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/government-debt-to-gdp ) = $ 426bn . 
  that 's the 50bn loan for the banks ( 393-426 ) so that 's why our debt jumped again . 
  so 495bn debt with ~ 50bn haircut , that 's a 10-15 % debt reduction . 
  not 50 % . 
  netflix in greece does n't even have greek subtitles for the majority of their stuff . 
  while i will not tell you if you 're being overly cautious , i will however take advantage of that fact and suggest to take a look at any * not overly * touristy greek islands . 
  southern crete for instance is great for family vacations , has beaches , mountains , view , cheap prices , no immigrants ( if you 're skeptical about that ) and a remarkable absence of any noteworthy target for extremists ... not that we have any history with religious extremism in greece though . 
  responding to the demand is not the same thing as agreeing . 
  the response might be negative or positive . 
  it refers to the exact same comment i linked . 
  he promised no such thing . 
   [ greek prime minister alexis tsipras told erdogan the process of examining the asylum requests of the soldiers will be `` brief , '' in a telephone call late saturday . 
  tsipras also told erdogan greece will abide by international law and respect human rights . 
  ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-16/greece-mulls-return-of-soldiers-who-fled-turkey-in-helicopter ), 
  it will take 15 days to process their asylum request - as is proper , so no , their request wo n't be `` declined within a day '' . 
  however , most probable scenario is that yes , they will be deported . 
  which has nothing to do with morality and everything to do with the law . 
  as it stands , there is no death penalty in turkey . 
  if they reinstate it * while * their asylum request is being considered then things of course will change . 
  but i highly doubt that they 'll be able in two weeks time to reinstate the death penalty there . 
  and no , we wo n't be able to hold them on account of there being a chance that they 'll reinstate it . 
  our government , incapable as it might be , did not `` wait to see the outcome '' before taking a stance on the coup . 
  we do n't like erdogan , but we like military coups even * less * . 
  so no double * anything * here . 
  people are romanticizing what happened . 
  we are talking about treason , overthrowing a * legally * elected government . 
  the fact of the matter is , most turkish people support erdogan and that 's that . 
  those military people might have nothing to do with it , they might have been simply following orders , but it 's not for * us * to decide . 
  it 's for the turkish justice system . 
  what * we * are to decide is if that justice system would treat them fairly . 
  and yes we know that they wo n't , but * knowing * is one thing , * proving * is another . 
  lastly spare us the integrity crap . 
  we have to live next to them , it 's nice and easy to sit on the moral chair when you 're 3000km away . 
  where were the moral upright countries , our allies , when we had all those incidents with turkey in the past ? 
  did anyone support us ? 
  those `` heroes '' put us in a precarious position now , we 're fucked anyway this goes .
