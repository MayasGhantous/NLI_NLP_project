  send them back , they get executed , we 're to blame . 
  keep them , give erdogan more excuses to create incidents and strain our already strained relationship . 
  but hey , you got our backs , right ? 
  do n't visit greece . 
  not because we 'll discriminate against you because you 're autistic or have arab descent though . 
  we simply do n't like prejudiced people . 
  there are rumors in greek media stating that erdogan was going to purge the aforementioned military people anyway , so those people did n't have much to lose . 
  lies . 
  i 'm not saying that we wo n't return them . 
  but not before they meet the d.a. 
  tomorrow and their position is heard . 
   but in examining their requests , it will be taken into account that they participated in an attempt to overthrow the democratic regime and the constitutional order in the neighboring country , '' a government spokeswoman , olga gerovasili , said . 
  we 'll return them probably . 
  if we do n't return them - apart from the typical shitstorm that will ensue - we would be formally acknowledging that turkey 's justice system is not capable of handling the matter by international standards . 
  their treatment would be inhumane or their trial not just etc etc. 
  which is a huge diplomatic no-no regardless if we informally know that to be true . 
  ** from greek media : ** the national tv channel has been reinstated . 
  army personnel is being arrested . 
  roads are being open . 
  erdogan 's plane is about to land in istanbul . 
  some military forces ( coup supporters ) have yet to back down though and are bombarding the parliament . 
  our government ( greece ) stated that they support the democratic procedures . 
  that message was given to the turkish govt via the typical diplomatic circles and our p.m will talk with erdogan and yildirim tomorrow morning . 
  so yeah , while they did not claim support of erdogan , they support the way he was elected . 
  greek media : erdogan 's plane is approaching istanbul 's airport . 
  the greek high command was aware of high turkish military mobilization , all greek personnel passes were revoked , our intelligence agency was on full alert etc etc , so it 's not that no one caught word . 
  but amidst the terror attack in nice and this climate in general , a coup probably was n't the first thing that came to mind . 
  ~ ~ it looks like it failed . ~ ~ ------ too much conflicting information ... 
  this will backfire ... tremendously . 
   no other people do this in / r/europe that 's because we 're the most hardworking people in europe . 
   yet of all the european people its only greeks who get salty about such things and feel the need to correct them . 
  and from all the european people , it 's only a greek who gets salty about a greek being salty about a thing , and felt the need to post it as a comment here . 
  -- now in all seriousness , i was bored at that time and i was thinking maybe it would be * funnier * if i presented a version which was closer to the truth . 
  it was 1.17:1 but has risen to 1.19:1 since yesterday . 
  i was hoping to order some stuff of off amazon.co.uk next week , we 'll see if it 's worth the hassle . 
  a german does not claim shakespeare was german , is he ? 
  or that his country should extend to london ? 
  the problem is n't the name . 
  the problem is the heritage and the aspirations . 
  they do not speak the same language . 
  the birthplace of alexander is [ pella ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/pella+580+05,+greece/@40.7566842,22.4622303,13.5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x1357d6e3994c1551:0x400bd2ce2b9aa90!8m2!3d40.7632436!4d22.5260527?hl=en ) , which lies in the outskirts of the second largest greek city now . 
  incidentelly , pella was also the capital of the kingdom of macedon . 
  they have exactly zero customs/mores shared . 
  the only thing that ties them to alexander is that his empire also contained ( some of ) their parts . 
  can the iraqis claim to be descendants of alexander ? 
  can an irish who migrated to the states call himself descendant of the sioux just because he 's living in minnesota ? 
  well imagine him living in wisconsin and claiming to have minnesota sioux heritage , because that 's how absurd their claim is . 
  the problem is , * we * can . 
  because we * still * speak that language . 
  well , some of it anyway .

  it sure as hell wo n't say `` macedonian '' . 
  it 's not ... until it is . 
  it 's like bob . 
  i like bob . 
  he has his problems , but i like him . 
  we get along mostly fine . 
  ** but by god if he as much as breathes my way i 'll fucking shank him ** . 
  -- hmm . 
  i 'd call it ... complicated . 
  i doubt this was even written/drawn up by a greek . 
  no greek will ever claim that eu is `` workaholic '' , far from it . 
  we 'll even claim that * we 're * the hard workers . 
  started making my own but got tired . 
  anyway , here 's the non complete one : [ europe according to a real greek . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vgi8kqg.png ) not as pretty as op 's though . 
   in the grand scheme of things it simply does n't matter how many % of gdp estonia spends , it simply can not deter russia . 
  in my opinion , it matters . 
  a small country does n't need a huge army to defend itself . 
  now granted gdp is n't the best metric but flat $ is n't either . 
  i mean , the swiss deterred the third reich in wwii . 
  you 'll just need to be able to defend that much so it wo n't be worth it for the aggressor . 
  nato has done jack shit in all the greek-turkish incidents . 
  and i doubt that it could , seeing that we have been both nato members since the 50 's . 
  and i 'm * mostly * pro-nato . 
  that was the first thing that came to my mind too . 
  however the article has exactly zero mentions of greece , of a greek exit or anything pertaining to greece it 's probably a regret + exit = regrexit and talks about the uk of course . 
  in which case , media people , how about enough with this - exit shit ? 
  the problem is that it 's not realistic . 
  not for the foreseeable future at least . 
  the funds they received were based on certain subsidies , eu programs etc. 
  programs that took years of planning , lawmaking , red tape etc. 
  so unless the brits pass a law overnight which states that uk will cover * all * the eu funding from their own budget for the exact amounts no questions asked , they will not see that funding . 
  i doubt uk will be able in two years or whenever they 'll stop receiving those funds to create said programs , and even if they do , i very much doubt they 'll attribute the same amount of funds . 
  well , if you brits change your mind , you can always look at our referendum for inspiration . 
  - the referendum was about * thinking * of leaving the eu . 
  not actually leaving . 
  - the referendum was not meant as a leave or stay decision , but more of `` do we need better terms or not '' . 
  etc etc or claim that the referendum results are too muddied for such an important decision , wait 5-10 years for all those 65 + year old people to die off , and retake it . 
  but on a more serious note : i did not expect this ... 
  largest one i could find . 
  i met a nice elderly uk couple this summer that were in favor of brexit and mentioned that `` fact '' to me . 
  unfortunately as they were customers and well , it was n't my place exactly to convince them otherwise , i simply suggested to always take statements from either side with a grain of salt . 
  they were very passionate about it though so i doubt i could convince them anyway . 
  sorry man but i still do n't understand which point still stands . 
  i mean , do we speak the same language at this point ? 
  someone said that they talk reforms = we think taxes . 
  i said it 's not our fault we think that because that 's what 's been asked of us . 
  i did not blame the germans for anything . 
  i did not blame the creditors for anything apart from that misconception .
