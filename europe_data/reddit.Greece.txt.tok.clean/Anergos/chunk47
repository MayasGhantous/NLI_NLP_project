  nowhere did i touch taxation , debt or whatever you think i blamed the `` others '' for . 
  dude , let what rest ? 
  at which point do i blame germans for anything ? 
  i am just saying that reforms ! = fiscal adjustments and what is being asked of us is not the former . 
  also i did not claim that their sending the hounds will not be of help . 
  i simply said it 's not reform . 
  it 's one thing to reform - re-form , change to a significant degree - another to accept help to track down tax evasion that 's happening using the existing system . 
  a successful reform in the tax system for instance would mean less tax evasion , less reasons to tax evade , more difficult to tax evade etc. 
  sending a couple of hundred hounds to crack down on the tax evaders is not reform , at best you might argue it 's better application of the existing mechanisms . 
  for example : change the way people are taxed . 
  change the way people are doing their taxes . 
  reduce the cash transactions . 
  examine the areas where shadow economy is strong and change them . 
   and you hear `` adding taxes and slashing social budget '' well , that 's not our fault to be honest . 
  i mean during all the negotiations check what was ( and is ) being demanded of us . 
  purely fiscal adjustments . 
  hell , regardless of how incompetent our govt is , they did have some actual reforms in mind but got shot down . 
  actual reforms might ( and realistically will ) produce deficits in the short run . 
  you ca n't really expect to transition from one system to another without incurring some kind of cost . 
  and that was a ) unacceptable and b ) unattainable with the goals set by the creditors . 
  so yeah , sorry , but when the creditors talk about reforms , they might figuratively talk about improving tax collection etc but in reality what is allowed is simply adding taxes and slashing budget . 
   the european taxpayers are already paying off greece 's debt by giving them lower than market rate loans . 
  for instance for almost all ( perhaps not germany ) ez countries the interest on the bonds they had to issue to loan the money to greece ( via the esm ) will be far higher than the interest greece is paying . 
   low interest loans are essentially debt forgiveness by the back door . 
  esm [ does not service only ] ( http://www.esm.europa.eu/assistance/fcc/index.htm ) greece . 
  it was created for all eu countries and have serviced spain and cyprus apart from greece . 
  and you might be surprised to learn that greece also contributes to that mechanism and at a rate larger than austria , portugal , finland etc etc. 
  [ source ] ( http://www.esm.europa.eu/about/governance/shareholders/index.htm ) . 
  so no , eu taxpayers are not already paying off greece 's debt by means of those loan rates , at least where esm is concerned . 
  esm contributions would have been paid one way or the other . 
  just to dispel some typical crap spewed my media . 
  the law states that if the road is covered in snow , we have the choice of winter tires or anti-slip chains ( or what they 're called ) . 
  however having one of the two is ** mandatory ** , but only in cases of snow . 
  so , yeah , the map tells half-truths . 
  and the law makes sense in our case , because as you stated , we do n't * really * need winter tires in greece . 
  just so people do n't make the wrong assumptions : those migrants were stated to be returned to turkey anyway . 
  they tried to return themselves so as to not be detained by the turkish officials . 
  it can easily be explained . 
  he 'll just spend orthodox easter in greece . 
  vegetarian campaign?he 's simply fasting till this sunday . 
  adopt sheeps ? 
  well , that 's true in a sense . 
  at least till this sunday . 
  then , well ... google `` greek easter lamb '' . 
  that 's somehow difficult . 
  yeah , x of country y is starting to get tiring imho . 
  i would n't mind a megathread once per week for such things though . 
  in greece atleast , in order to get a subscription you need to provide proof of residency . 
  i assume something similar is required in all countries in the eu . 
  then you have this :  roaming charges will no longer apply , as long as you are using your phone abroad temporarily . 
  providers can still charge you for using your sim card in another country permanently . 
  so yeah , at some point you will be charged with roaming charges which if i were to guess , would be way more expensive than your domestic prices . 
  yeah , us is not really hot on my to-visit places either . 
  there 's so much fucking prejudice against non americans , if anything happens while you 're there and you 're involed , you 're fucked . 
  ** example : ** a short greek priest was beaten by a 2m bodybuilder with a tire iron because according to the bodybuilder 1 ) he talked arabic and shouted alahu ackbar and attacked the american 2 ) tried to rob him bare handed 3 ) made sexual advances towards him in perfect english . 
  the greek priest on the other hand claimed his gps was n't working properly and got out of the car to ask for directions . 
  his english was very limited . 
  the us justice system saw fit to drop the case . 
  the 2meter bodybuilder later went on tv and said `` i do forgive him for what he 's done to me ... i 'm over it . '', 
  it was 60 for women 65 for men . 
  and you started getting the pension one year later , so essentially 61/66 . 
  now it 's 67/67 and the +1 y is still in effect ( so essentially 68/68 ) . 
  that was from [ 2004-2005 ] ( http://www.refworld.org/docid/45f1473b11.html\\ ) ) . 
  ** greek ** -- depends on the context . 
  context : * question * | when does the cat hide 4 fat fish ? 
  ** context : * statement , main actor is the cat * | the cat hides 4 fat fish under full moon . 
  ** and so on . 
   on the other hand , as someone pointed out in the article comments , one of the big reasons london is such a popular tourist spot is precisely all the heritage they have squirreled away in their museums . 
  ( same goes for rome , paris , st. petersburg , new york etc etc. ), 
  no way i 'll ever be able to visit 100 different cities/countries , so having a lot of `` stuff '' be present in fewer locations is convenient . 
  the exchange/loan of artifacts is perfecty fine and it 's being done for ages now . 
  egyptian exhibitions in the us , france lending to abu dhabi and so on . 
  no one is suggesting that this should stop happening . 
  and shit , if the marbles were to be returned , i guarrantee you that the brits could pull a deal to host the complete set for years . 
  but it wo n't happen . 
  too much money involed and not enough morals . 
  whetever goodwill they 'll get from the return of the marbles will be extended to them by greece and greece alone . 
  and we all know how much influential in eu my country is . 
  the others wo n't give a shit . 
  so yeah - while the right thing to do - not happening . 
  92.8 billion in arrears . 
  80 % of it is owed by 5k bussinesses/people . 
  while the rest 20 % is owed by 4million bussinesses/people . 
   lol , does the beep start with f and rhyme with duck ? 
  yeah  it 's a very funny expression . 
  well , its meaning is i * beep * everything that you hold holy . 
  or something like that . 
   can orthodox christians use the christ 's name like that ? 
  should - according to the church - people do it ? 
  do they ( we ) still do it ? 
  yeah . 
  common swear phrases in greece include : `` i * beep * your christ '' . 
  and `` i * beep * your madonna '' ( while not referring to the pop singer ) . 
  and so on . 
  you know how the brits call their flag union jack , the americans stars and stripes etc ? 
  ours is the `` skybluewhite '' or `` cyanwhite '' . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/77130864.jpg ) a `` small '' one that shows the color . 
  but you 'll find darker ones or ligher ones as well . 
  the flag is `` light blue '' and is closer to the / r/place turquoise than blue ( r , g , b ) top is what the greek flag is in reality , bottom left is place 's turquoise , bottom right is the blue : http://imgur.com/a/10gf0 plus our older flag was of that color roughly . 
  well , it 's not goodwill ... it 's the law . .
