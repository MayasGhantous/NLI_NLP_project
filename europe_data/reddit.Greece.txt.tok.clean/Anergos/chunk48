  the article does not answer the question ( how millions in refugee funds were wasted in greece ) . 
  they do not even show how much of the funds were * actually * used , their only source was  one senior aid official admitted that as many as $ 70 out of every $ 100 spent had been wasted . 
  basically if you read carefully , the whole article reads like `` ministry of migration policy was incompetent '' without even showing * where * it failed ... bullcrap article, 
  reparations ? 
  germany ? 
  i 'm not too late , am i ? 
  it has nothing to do with `` personality '' and everything to do with the type of economy . 
  greek economy is predominately a service industry with a huge percent of the total workforce being self employed . 
  that 's it . 
  go check statistics from the irs in the states , where tax collection is no joke . 
  you 'll find that the outlook of the tax avoidance amongst the self employed is the same with the greek one . 
  self employed people tax evade because they can . 
  he 's not greek . 
  probably from india , maybe living in the uk . 
  my neighbours are having their first child . 
  they were not married . 
  they got married because and i quote the man `` those motherfuckers want 3k euros to recognize the child out of wedlock but the marriage ( mayor 's hall ) will cost less than 100 '',

   being religious makes a person at least a bit unintelligent . 
  ** i 'm an atheist and this is stupid . 
  ** what if you enjoy going to church ? 
  or being a part of a social group ? 
  or you like the texts ? 
  or the customs ? 
  maybe you 're talking about the beliefs : can anyone prove or disprove the existance of a soul ? 
  can you tell with a 100 % degree of certainty that there is no such thing as afterlife ? 
  or god ? 
  one of the facets of science and intelligence is being open to any possibility . 
  yet you claim that it 's `` unintelligent '' . 
  no it 's not . 
  it 's ** stupid ** to believe verbatim that a snake convinced a naked pair to eat an apple . 
  it 's ** not stupid ** to use that story as a means to transmit a set of ideals . 
  go check how many * really * intelligent people where/are religious . 
  but you , an average person , know better . 
  well , he was born in greece * and * his father was born in greece . 
  for me that 's more than enough , assuming he even cares to think of him as one ( greek ) . 
  who the f *** is prince philip ? ... googles him ... married to queen elizabeth ii of england ... 
  he * ca n't * be greek ... googles further , born in greece . 
  [ we 've always spend large on military ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ms.mil.xpnd.gd.zs?locations=gr ) , even before the crisis . 
  we have a saying in greece for old junky cars . 
  it translate to this : paint it blue and throw it to the sea . 
  step one complete . 
  good good . 
  everybody invest in gyros and tzatziki . 
   so the alternative to getting new loans is to get new loans that have 0 interest ? 
  it 's to restructure the current loans . 
  it 's not 0 interest , it 's not even 0 interest for x years . 
   that ` hiatus ' is just debt refinancing that is paid by someone else . 
  someone pays your debt , and issues you a new loan with no interest rate that has to be paid back x years in the future . 
  come on now . 
  first of all debt refinancing is always paid by someone else . 
  it 's like saying you 're getting a loan where someone else loans you money . 
  the only reason to put it that way is to rile up people - hey , he 's asking for money again !, 
  and no , it 's not debt refinancing . 
  it 's debt restructuring . 
  no one needs to pay anyone anything , unless you claim ecb changing the terms of the loan is like ecb paying ecb to make a new loan . 
   it does n't become less of a gamble just because someone pays the bill for you . 
  no one is paying the bill for us . 
  read my comment . 
  there 's no mention for new loans , the whole premise is to run a balanced budget . 
  but instead of bleeding out the 2-3 % of surplus to creditors , you put it into the economy . 
   which is the case if you give someone a zero interest rate loan , due to inflation you will lose money . 
  how many times will you claim this in your comment . 
  ** it 's not zero interest loan ** . 
  where did i ask for a zero interest loan ? 
   there 's still a very high risk that your 150 % larger economy is just another bubble that will burst the moment you reduce spending so you can pay back your debt . 
  there is zero risk of this happening because whatever economic growth took place , it took ** without external loans ** . 
   you know what will also make your debt grow ? 
  if you do n't have a surplus and stop following austerity . 
  because you have to take new loans to increase public spending . 
  we 've been over this a million times . 
  you do n't need austerity to have a balanced sheet . 
  give a hiatus on debt repayment for x years on condition of following the `` plan '' . 
  put that 3.5 % primary surplus back inside the economy . 
  let the economy grow * with a balaced sheet * ( so no extra debt created ) for that time . 
  after said amount of time has passed start repaying the full amount . 
  even if we put only 2 % back into the economy , in 20 years we 'd have a 150 % larger economy better able to copy with the payments ** with no extra debt ** . 
   cyclists to wear a plastic hat . 
  but as i said before when you showed me that those are actually plastic crap . 
  i 'm not for wearing crap on your head . 
  i do support wearing * proper * protection if you 're going to use the main roads though . 
  as for your other points i 've already answered to in my previous posts . 
   do you believe that there should be at most two safety features and then we stop ? 
  then why should n't we require drivers also wear fireproof garments ? 
  or kneepads ? 
  why should n't we require people wear bulletproof vests ? 
  i mean there are people getting shot . 
  or wear life jackets . 
  surely a couple of people would n't be drowned each year if life jackets were mandatory ? 
  see the problem ? 
  as i said in my other comment  you have to balance inconvinience and likelihood of the event that that protection is needed . 
  a seat belt and airbag are good enough . 
  they 're not there to reduce the chance you get a head injury . 
  they 're there so when you do , you do n't die . 
   nope . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  demand is suppressed by unfriendly conditions . 
  you build the infrastructure and cycling goes up . 
  the dutch showed this . 
  well if your economy/politicians can support this , you 'll find no argument from me .
