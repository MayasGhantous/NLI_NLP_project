  but i 'm greek . 
  it 'll be easier to put a man on the moon . 
  [ oh wait ... ] ( http://en.protothema.gr/greece-to-establish-its-own-hellenic-space-agency-national-center-for-space-applications-ncsa/ )  in most civilised countries we have not yet banned people from walking on the road ? 
  yeah , in my uncivilized country we chop their heads . 
   do all greek roads have sidewalks by the way ? 
  law says there should be . 
  for instance when i built my house , i was required to leave sidewalk space . 
   irrelevant . 
  this is irrelevant but asking for pedestrians to also wear helmets is not ? 
  riiiight  i 'm not . 
  i 'm asking you to provide reason for your opinions . 
  ok . let 's not be serious . 
  why not force all the people to wear bulletproof vests all the time ? 
  people are getting shot . 
  why not force all the people to wear life jackets all the time . 
  people do drown . 
  why not force all the people to wear parachutes . 
  planes do fall . 
  you have to balance inconvinience and likelihood of the event that that protection is needed . 
  100 % of the population who can actually move , are pedestrians . 
  how many are getting in accidents where a helmet might save their lives ? 
   head injuries are as common in cars as on bikes . 
  so i assume you also believe that everyone in a car should wear a helmet . 
  no because there are seat belts and air bags . 
  which are there exactly to protect your head . 
   you 'd have a great point if there were cycle lanes everywhere if there is demand , if a large enough percentage of the populace is using bicycles there should be . 
   if other road users had to use helmets . 
  again , the road is ** not ** for pedestrians . 
  sidewalks are for pedestrians . 
  for every other vehicle they 're required to have a helmet or wear a seatbelt . 
   why not ? 
  come now , let 's not degrade a serious issue . 
  you are correct . 
   it is intended to give protection in the kind of accident where the rider falls onto the road without other vehicles being involved . 
  if that is the case , i have been mistaken . 
  but that does n't change much of my opinion . 
  the helms * need * to provide actual protection . 
  so either transition to * real * protective helms and allow the bicycles to use the road or use cyclist lanes . 
   you have jay walking laws in greece ? 
  and people do n't get hit by cars on those crossings ? 
  yes we have . 
  and yes they do . 
  but you ca n't ask people to wear helmets because you ( jaywalking ) or someone else ( not stoping at pedestrian crossing ) will break the law . 
  a seat belt and airbags . 
   you need to read up on bicycle helmet standards . 
  ah , yes . 
  the typical i know stuff but you do n't , so go research first . 
  give me a link , quote or do n't bother . 
   i 've never been to greece , but where i live pedestrians cross roads from time to time yeah , here too . 
  but we 're using special parts of the road called '' [ pedestrian crossings ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/paris_street_corner,_from_the_promenade_plantee.jpg/350px-paris_street_corner,_from_the_promenade_plantee.jpg ) '' . 
  you might be right , however i do n't understand how these research findings compensate for the fact that while it makes sense you being more careful without the helmet , that only stands true up until you get used to the fact that you 're not wearing a helmet . 
  or more simply , in case i 'm not understood , you 'll be more careful only in the beginning till you `` forget '' you 're not wearing a helmet . 
  after that , i ca n't but think that you will revert to the way you always drive . 
  do they cycle on the main road as well ? 
   comparing bikes to bicycles are dumb , there 's a huge difference riding ~ 15km/h versus 50/90km/h you understand that the helm protects you from * other * vehicles as well , right ? 
  read the bold text in my op . 
   why not have pedestrians wear helmets as well then ? 
  because pedestrians walk on the ** sidewalk ** . 
  if bikes did n't use the same roads as cars and had their own roads , then yeah , i would n't care about helmets . 
  i 'm going to disagree with all of you . 
  ** as long as the bicycle uses the same roads as the other types of traffic , helmets should be mandatory . 
  ** all the justifications you used for not wearing a helmet while on a bicycle can be said for motor bikes as well . 
   the chances to hit your head while you 're riding a bicycle are rather small the same for bikes . 
  the helm is not there because landing on your head is common . 
  it 's there to protect the most vulnerable part of your body . 
  that 's why cart/fn drivers wear one , that 's why pilots wear one and so on . 
   if you know how to drive a bike properly , you do n't need a helmet '' . 
  yes you do . 
  the same with bikes . 
  the vast majority of time your skill has nothing to do with the accident . 
  another driver or a pedestrian or some other unforseen event would be to blame . 
  man i do n't know . 
  maybe because you need to prove that you 're well off and be able to take care of the kid since it 's essentially a type of adoption . 
  maybe to offset people trying to take tax cuts/loopholes for being `` parents '' . 
  i 'm no lawmaker . 
  but it 's * not * the church because it does n't make sense . 
  i 'm pro secularism as much as the next guy - even more , but this is not the church 's doing . 
  yeah but for political marriage . 
  you know , the type of marriage the church actually does not want . 
  if you want a typical christian marriage , it 's at least 10 times as much . 
  so if anything , that system actually hurts the church . 
  it probably has more to do with bureaucratic crap . 
  you know , it 's something not really common so more paperwork , man hours , yada yada . 
  your guess is as good as mine . 
  it 's not religion . 
  it 's the $ 3000 you need in order to recognize a child outside a marriage vs the $ 50-150 in order to get married . 
  friend of mine got married for this exact reason . 
  it 's straight up logistics . 
  ** two parents birth scenario : ** cost of recognizing a child out of marriage : $ 3000 cost of marriage ( depending on the city ) : $ 40-150 it 's actually * cheaper * to marry and file for a divorce later than straight up recognizing a child out of marriage . 
  ** single parent birth scenario ** science fiction . 
  in this climate the ** vast majority ** mothers would have an abortion before trying to tackle parenthood alone . 
   they saved us from communism so he has a point yes they saved us from communism . 
  * how * they did it is the problem . 
  and to an extend * why * . 
  i 'm not claiming communism is better . 
  i 'm simply stating that they did n't fucking care how many greeks died , just as long as communism did n't take hold here . 
  which ofc the same thing stands for ussr . 
  i 'm not claiming communism would have been better - far from it . 
  however neither the reason nor the way we were `` saved '' were kosher . 
  they did n't give a damn how many greeks were killed as long as communism did n't take hold here .
