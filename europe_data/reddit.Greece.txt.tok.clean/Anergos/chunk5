  imf said in order for them to take part , the debt must be sustainable ( haircut/restructure/something ) but the eu refuses to talk about debt restructuring ( haircut is off the table ) without greece making the reforms * first * . 
  but most of the reforms need time to be legislated . 
  greece is snap-passing every law dictated that they can get through quickly , but many `` reforms '' ( example : `` find equivalent of x % and cut '' ) is unreasonable to assume it can be found in a few days . 
  so a `` bridge '' loan was given to stave of the first wave of payments . 
  but the situation is getting worse . 
  see , the bank closures hurt the economy * really bad * . 
  and while this is continuing the situation is degrading . 
  so with eu and imf are at an impasse , the greek economy in shambles and the left `` anti-austerity '' government trying to pass what is considered the most recessionary measures since the start of the crisis , a government which sacked some members of their party and had to do a cabinet reshuffle , time is running out . 
  there is no way that we 'll hold till ~ october ( that 's about when people speculate that the evaluation of the reforms will take place ) . 
  so in essence , a tl : dr , ** eu wants imf in the bailouts , does n't * currently * want debt restructuring . 
  imf wants debt restructuring ** . 
  it was somewhat true ages ago . 
  that 's due to us meddling with greek and cypriot stuff behind the curtains . 
  you know , support for the junta , an ok for the turkish invasion of cyprus , older stuff during the cold war as well . 
  most recently we had the wiretapping scandal , which while it 's not proven , it 's heavily suggested that the taps were from the us . 
  but still , i doubt the greek opinion for the average american is bad . 
  for their agencies ? 
  sure . 
  but the average joe has no clue what is being happening and it 's pretty evident .

  at least that 's what i gathered from the coffee cap and receipt . 
  brain not working . 
  thanks . 
   this ranges from a high of 59 % in greece there was a billboard `` ad '' in front of a coffee shop in ios some years back . 
  ** classic greek breakfast ** greek frappe and half a pack of marlboros price : x, 
  beautiful . 
  are they throwing water on the eiffel tower ? 
  what is that mist ? 
  on another note , i now i have to take a loan to pay for all that bandwidth . 
  4k uncompressed photo, 
  there was this illusion that sellers would absorb the cost . 
  the actual tweet is funnier . 
   it 's working , vat up to 23 % , yesterday cappuccino 1,80 $ , today 1,90 $ cappuccino is 10c more expensive , how are greeks going to live now ... 
   gabriel heads off to forge business links with iran and our minister of defense goes to israel and throws a `` if an iranian bomb were to fall in the mediterranean it would be game over '' ... and people wonder why on earth there are no investments coming from the middle east . 
  no we got a new loan to pay the imf loan that was used to pay the bailout loan that was used to buyout the bank loan . 
  or something . 
   and while you have n't stolen money the fact is that greece as a country has received money for it and has n't finished it in 20 bloody years . 
  ca n't you see how extremely corrupt it is and how upsetting it is ** for those of us who paid for it ** ? 
   and yes , it pisses me off when ** my tax ** money get misspent . 
  you ** do ** know that the land registry started in 1994 and that sweden accented in 1995 , right ? 
  just sayin ... 
  no , the process has already started . 
  i wrote by stuff both in athens and in crete . 
  just to give you a rough estimation , writing down a plot in athens took me about 20minutes . 
  writing down my plots in crete took me about 2 hours . 
  and the person responsible was a cousin of mine who knew my lands . 
  ( they sent a person knowledgeable to each village to facilitate ) but it 's not complete yet . 
  and i doubt it will be anytime soon from what i 've experienced . 
  people need to repatriate , the courts have two years + wait time etc. 
  i do n't know if they can streamline the process . 
  i do n't doubt we really need this , as i do n't doubt the governments have taken their sweet time about it . 
  but it ai n't easy . 
  there is a land registry . 
  it 's not complete . 
   `` the problem is that the greeks have n't bothered to implement it until now and now they come up with the most silly excuse i 've ever heard . '', 
  i am trying in a civil manner to explain to you what the difficulties i personally found when i was trying to write my stuff on the registry and why it might be taking so long . 
  i am not the fucking government , nor have i taken 100m from you to make the registry . 
  so throw your blame elsewhere . 
   they come up with the most silly excuse i 've ever heard . 
  again , i am giving you possible explanations based on what i 've experienced . 
  i did not have to explain myself to you , i did it so you could understand why this is not an easy task . 
  and you reward my reply by calling it `` silly '' and constantly throwing blame on `` greeks '' . 
  as if the common people had anything to do with it . 
  i would have gone into more detail , about people needing to repatriate to write their stuff and so on , but the only thing you 'll know how to respond is by accusations and further insults . 
  so i wo n't bother . 
   wtf does age and mountains has to do with anything ? 
  old deeds did not have the requirements that newer have . 
  you know `` actual '' measurements . 
  topographic maps . 
  things that make registering your land easy . 
  mountainous areas are impossible to define from satellite photos without elevation maps . 
  a plot of land 's apparent size ( as looked from the photos ) is smaller than it actually is depending on the inclination ( real_size x cos ( inclination , degrees ) = apparent_size ) . 
  i do n't know how the countries you mentioned tackled the issue . 
  maybe they did it over a span of several years . 
  maybe there was land redistribution . 
  maybe there are n't many people owning plots in no-where land . 
  you should ask them . 
  about the land registry , i 'll chime in because i know a couple of things . 
  greek land deeds are * old * . 
  there has been no land redistribution and greece is pretty mountainous . 
  there in lies the problem of the land registry . 
  in cities , it 's pretty easy to implement and it has been done . 
  but in the periphery , it 's no easy task . 
  imagine having a deed - and i shit you not , that 's exactly the form of many if not most of the deeds - that describes the land borders like this : the property extents from the road down the creek , it follows the creek till it reaches a rock then goes southwest till it reaches the hill and ... etc. 
  the properties are seldom well defined or square . 
  so in such events you 'll probably have to send an engineer or what-they 're - called to make actual measurements . 
  then you 'll need to take into account the disputes , have witnesses , possibly court actions and so on . 
  most of these places are n't reachable by car . 
  i mean , mine is n't . 
  we had to use satellite photos , which was very helpful for people that are somewhat used to `` reading '' photos . 
  but ask a 60-70 year old to pinpoint his land from an airplane/satellite photo and things get complicated really fast . 
  that 's without even considering what i 've mentioned , a `` greedy '' neighbor disputing the assertions . 
  that 's not being lazy . 
  that 's being efficient . 
  you knew someone would eventually provide you with the exact information you wanted and thus allow you to productively spent your time elsewhere . 
  well mine too ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ article ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ was ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ portuguese ... 
  repost of my comment above :  the vanguard is supposed to be made by the founding eu members . 
  though just to be clear , manuel valls said that , it 's not clear if hollande meant the same . 
  the vanguard is supposed to be made by the founding eu members .
