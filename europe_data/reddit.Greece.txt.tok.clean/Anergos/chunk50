  the same goes for ussr ofc . 
  `` saved '' . 
  right after wwii we had a civil war , where the brits/us fueled one side and ussr the other . 
  the commie side lost . 
  160.000 were killed . 
  right after being ravaged in wwii . 
  some explanation about the result for greece . 
  it 's preferred * over the others * . 
  it 's like been asked to choose between cow shit , horse shit and sheep shit . 
  of course we 'll pick sheep shit . 
  it 's not that we * like * sheep shit , we simply * prefer it * over the others . 
  us backed a junta here 40y ago . 
  uk has our marbles and ai n't exactly viewed as very trustworthy . 
  we do n't have much contact with india and china . 
  meh , at least russians have something in common with us ( religion/orthodox ) . 
  ergo the result . 
  but if there was a `` none '' acceptable answer , that would be it for greece as to `` who has our backs '' . 
  switched to vaping 6 % nic after smoking 20 rolled cigs / day for more than 15y . 
  vaped for 4 months and then finally quit . 
  on time too as they 've introduced the same extreme taxation in e-liquids as cigarettes in my country , price trippled + . 
  i 've been smoke free 3 months now . 
  just to give you some encouragement . 
  define legal owners . 
  nazis were the `` legal owners '' as well . 
  clearly ? 
  apparently many do n't think so , if it 's been a debate in your country as well ( by mps no less ) or when organizations like unesco do n't see it like that . 
  define how many years should pass before people lose their cultural heritage after being conquered by war . 
  how many years are enough for your moral compass to not give a damn ? 
  of course they did . 
  the same way the third reich was justified in [ looting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kunstschutz ) , er , i mean * transfering * every notable piece of artwork from the occupied countries in order to `` protect '' them . 
  does the justification ring a bell ? 
  you know the kicker ? 
  the nazis at least * claimed * they 'd return the artefacts after the end of the hostilities . 
  very bad timing . 
  with no us to mend the fences and keep back channels open , this is actually pretty dangerous . 
  lion , eagle , lion , lion , eagle , two headed eagle , two lions , lions * and * eagles , wait that 's ... three lions , a lion inside an eagle , a lion inside a lion ... heh , no copyright laws back in the middle ages :p, 
   because the eurozone and greece had an agreement that it would invest its surplus into the unemployed . 
  there was no such agreement . 
  granted the money could have been spent better , but there was no deal-breaking . 
   wow , you tried really hard to not make it look like one . 
  why do n't you give me your version then ? 
  or critisizing exactly what is wrong with mine instead of `` i made it not look like one '' ? 
  after 10y each `` generation '' displaces the next . 
  the last gen goes to the grave . 
  again , how exactly does this resemble a pyramid ? 
  [ this is ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ioja3 ) the pension system . 
  adjust the numbers however you like . 
  how exactly is it a pyramid scheme ? 
  in which way does it come * even close * to resemble a pyramid ? 
  you probably replied to the wrong comment . 
   the problem with that though , is that it 's a pyramid scheme it 's not a pyramid scheme , the parallel is totally off . 
  people die off , there are maybe * three * generations active at the same time . 
  you do n't get something for free , what you get paid is based on the job you did , the amount of years you did , how much you paid so on . 
  it has nothing to do with how many people are `` below '' you except from the fact that there needs to be a healthy population in order to sustain the pension system . 
  you would n't even need that ** if ** there would have been a foolproof way to invest the `` retirement tax '' you paid during the years of your job in such a profitable way in order to account for inflation et al. 
  and there are countries where foolproof or not , it still is the way the pension system works , but then , you do n't hear people losing their pensions in the eu because someone embezzled their pension fund . 
  there is no solution to this bar population increase . 
  what kind of reforms do you suggest ? 
  increasing retirement age by the rate that our lifespan increases ? 
  increasing taxation by the rate that our lifespan increases ? 
  decreasing pensions by the rate that our lifespan increases ? 
  * that * is an unsustainable proposition . 
  there is no magical `` reform '' that can take place and solve this issue . 
  we will do what we are doing through-out the human history . 
  increase population and expand . 
  when our land is not enough , we look for more land . 
  in the same continent . 
  in other continents . 
  on other planets . 
  i do n't understand your point . 
  are you saying that we need to control population growth because of technological unemployment ? 
  when we reach a stage were this will matter so much that we 'll need to factor population growth , humans wo n't have to work . 
  you ca n't fix this problem by adjusting taxes or pension reforms . 
  you need to have population growth that outpaces the increase in life span . 
  so unless we reach a plateau where medicine/technology/et al ca n't increase our life span , our population needs to keep growing . 
  or we need to start killing old people . 
  the problem is n't the population shrinking . 
  it 's the side-effect , the population * aging * . 
  abiding by the peace treaty and a couple of comments from the leadership is n't exactly what i call friendship imho . 
  i mean you had nasser , religion , the six day war , yom kippur , the 4 times that the egyptian embassador has been recalled since 1980 , the denounciations against israel attacks vs the palestines , heck 5y ago they almost went to war again when egyptian military broke the treaty . 
  israel and egypt ... friends ? 
  ... am i missing something ? 
   on the other hand we had many collections that belongs to our nation and are now in the hands of thiefs from other countries . 
  it would be great if we could take it back . 
  not going to happen unfortunately . 
  parts of the fricking parthenon were carved out and are now proudly displayed in the british museum and those wo n't be returned . 
  and their justification ? 
  they were `` legaly '' acquired . 
  a permit was `` given '' for their removal from the ottoman government who then occupied greece . 
  so unless it 's like really apparent that they were stolen and * ca n't * justify it in any way , do n't expect anything to be returned . 
   with just enough meat to make a point , a real sausage or a fake one ? 
  there are actually regulations about that . 
  what can be labeled meat , sausage , cheese etc. 
   the difference between a vegan sausage and `` anergos '' sausage is that `` vegan '' actually means something . 
  vegan exactly like anergos , means nothing if it 's not an official designation . 
  which is not and ca n't be . 
  * not * being something ( an animal product in this case ) can not be a definition . 
  and even if it could , it 's so vague , you still would n't be able to make it work . 
  every label needs to meet some requirements . 
  there are tons of eu regulations concerning labeling .
