   if `` tasty sausages '' ( it is actually a thing here ) become a problem , we will deal with it that 's not the eu mindset . 
  generally they/we tend to be on the cautious side . 
  and you do n't need to look far into the future , just to the west . 
  we would n't want [ this ] ( http://1ue0vq2ip2m91b3g7z258a5v.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/i-cant-believe-its-not-butter-icbinb.png ) to happen to the eu market as well . 
   thank you very much for your gigantic efforts to pick exactly these interesting videos from the thousands of other . 
  which is ironic , since it 's ** exactly ** what you did . 
  and which is exactly the reason i did it .

  is this what is trully happening in russia ? 
  i 'll just quote what i replied to another person . 
   it 's not the vegan x that 's the problem . 
  it 's the x something . 
   if vegan sausage is allowed , then `` anergos '' sausage should be allowed . 
  or `` the '' sausage . 
  or `` tasty '' sausage . 
  and none of them would have to be actual sausages . 
  and that would be confusing . 
   the official excuse is that it 's supposedly misleading , and they are right . 
  you 're thinking way too short term . 
  it 's not the vegan x that 's the problem . 
  it 's the x * something * . 
  if vegan sausage is allowed , then `` anergos '' sausage should be allowed . 
  or `` the '' sausage . 
  or `` tasty '' sausage . 
  and none of them would have to be ** actual sausages ** . 
  and ** that ** would be confusing . 
  in those kinds of jobs , it 's the company that seeks to fill the position , not the other way around . 
  you do n't apply to be a ceo , coo , cfo and so on . 
  the company offers you that role . 
  so yeah , people who fill those kinds of positions would n't give a rat 's ass if german is one of the most useful languages in the world . 
  i still do n't undstand why they put `` germany 's '' infront of siemens . 
  as if there is any correlation between nationality and how corrupt or non corrupt a company is . 
   it seems really strange to make an agreement and then violate it there was no violation . 
  the issue is that tsipras unilatteraly decided how to disperse some money that were not accounted for . 
  esm thinks that that action will affect the ongoing program . 
  add to that the whole imf debackle and you get the idea . 
   if they already can fire them why are they not doing it an hiring part time slaves as you commented before ? 
  firstly it was not me . 
  you got ta learn to look beyond flags . 
  you can fire anyone in the private sector as long as you keep to a specific ratio ( standard in eu law ) of fired to kept workers . 
  brussels want to extend that ratio beyond what is commonly accepted in europe . 
   and yes it being hard to fire people obviously makes it a riskier investment . 
  this is basics economics , this is things you learn in upper secondary school . 
  it is not hard to fire people . 
  this is one of the things you learn as soon as you step outside your parent 's hourse and start working for a living . 
  what is hard however is justifying firing all your workforce and replacing it with part time people with no benefits . 
   also if companies are just waiting to fire people as soon as regulation become easier , perhaps their workers are n't that productive . 
  i doubt that has any truth to it though . 
  what really would happen would be that companies would start employing more people . 
  if you had a shop and your worker worked 8 hours and was paid $ 700 and benefits how can he be `` productive '' against two part timers working 6h per day and getting paid $ 300 with no benefits ? 
  ** that is basic economics ** . 
  plus greek economy is a service industry predominately , there 's no `` productive '' index that makes sense . 
   the fact is that companies will not hire new people because of the risk of making a bad decision . 
  the fact is companies ( that are not closing that is ) do not hire new people because they are not willing to expand their business under the current economy . 
  the ability to fire someone - which they very well have - has nothing to do with the current unemployment statistics . 
  you do n't go decreasing unemployment by decreasing the number of full time workers and turning them into part time workers . 
  you decrease it by inviting new business opportunities . 
  which increased taxes , having to pay the next years taxes in front , being under capital controls , all this uncertainty etc is not doing . 
  sorry but ** after ** the resolution of the crisis , who cares ? 
  do you want to know what an ally really does ? 
  read about the cyprus missile crisis . 
   turkish accession to the eu can only be implemented the moment she manages to solve her disputes with greece . 
  well dah ? 
  we have veto power ... 
   you know that 's not the true . 
  the reason europe does n't stand up against the turks is simple multiple times in the past we were in the brink of war with the turks ( for instance search for aegean crisis 1987 , imia islands 1996 ) . 
  exactly zero was the number of times a european country backed us up , offer support or hell even send an `` angry letter '' . 
  when the shit hits the fan it 's ( somewhat understandably ) everyone for himself . 
  sorry but i ca n't understand . 
   the countries that think the eu has messed up badly on the economy greeks disapprove at 92 % . 
  which should mean that they do ** not ** agree with the statement . 
  i would have thought it was the other way around ... edit stupid site , ca n't put correct titles in their articles for god 's sake . 
  and it 's  % of europeans who approve/disapprove of eu 's handling of economic issues . 
  which makes sense . 
   turkey hereby renounces all rights and title whatsoever over or respecting the territories situated outside the frontiers laid down in the present treaty and ** the islands other than those over which her sovereignty is recognised ** by the said treaty . 
  and you might as well put the turkish flag instead of the us one . 
  why hide it . 
  ** treaty of lausanne , article 15 & 16 ** turkey renounces in favour of italy all rights and title over the following islands : stampalia ( astrapalia ) , rhodes ( rhodos ) , calki ( kharki ) , scarpanto , casos ( casso ) , piscopis ( tilos ) , misiros ( nisyros ) , calimnos ( kalymnos ) , leros , patmos , lipsos ( lipso ) , simi ( symi ) , and cos ( kos ) , which are now occupied by italy , and the islets dependent thereon , and also over the island of castellorizzo . 
  turkey hereby renounces all rights and title whatsoever over or respecting the territories situated outside the frontiers laid down in the present treaty and the islands other than those over which her sovereignty is recognised by the said treaty , the future of these territories and islands being settled or to be settled by the parties concerned . 
  the provisions of the present article do not prejudice any special arrangements arising from neighbourly relations which have been or may be concluded between turkey and any limitrophe countries . 
  how come hawaii is a us state ? 
  why not share those islands with japan or mexico ? 
  and that 's more relevant question since hawaii is 4000 km ( ~ 2500 miles ) away from closest continental us shore , but most of those `` random '' islands are less than 50km ( 30miles ) from greek populated islands . 
  you * could * ask why greeks care that much about tiny unpopulated islands . 
  i would answer because of the same reason why turkey cares . 
  with 1 shitty piece of land comes a great chunk of aegen sea border . 
   he is saying why are you ( akp ) talking about how lausanne gave our lands to greeks but not doing anything about those 18 islands ? 
  but even in this statement he clearly implies that those 18 islands are not greek . 
  does it matter where the sentence was aimed at or what its purpose was ? 
  selling drugs on the internet is worse than selling a kid for his organs ? 
  that 's the * max * she can be punished with . 
  for trying to sell a child to a supposedly organ donor/harvesting ring . 
  [ just as a reminder , the same sentence is the max the operators of a drug dealing website could get . 
  ] ( https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/11/02/police-busted-major-internet-drug-operation-ukraine/ ) does this seem logical to you ? 
  selling drugs and selling kids carrying the same sentence ? 
  only 12y for human trafficking , exploitation of minors and such ? 
  and that 's the max sentence that * can * be applied ? 
  pheidias was a greek sculptor amongst other things . 
  he originally made the athena parthenos , a statue of the goddess athena , housed in the parthenon in athens . 
  he fled athens after accusations of embezzlement , olympia wanted to one-up athens so they hired him to make the statue of zeus .
