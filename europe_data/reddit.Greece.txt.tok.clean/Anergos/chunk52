  which he did . 
  if i recall correctly , he used a - not really understood till recently - technique of `` molding '' ivory and dressing it with gold . 
  so , ivory and gold were the main components . 
  its destruction is said to have happened either after the transfer of the statue to constantinople and destroyed in the subsequent fire of the lauseion or a fire on the temple of zeus proper , due to the abandonement after the decree of theodosius . 
  as far as plato 's academy , it was a school of philosophy . 
  it was open since 300 bc but closed for a while during the earlies ad but reopened . 
  it subsequently was closed , again because justinian i ( byzantine emperor ) claimed it promoted paganism . 
  while it 's roman history as well as greek at that point ( and place ) , constantinople ( 330ad ) was founded . 
  theodosius bans olympic games , closes all the `` pagan '' temples . 
  fire destroys the statue of zeus . 
  justinian i closes the ( neo ) platonic academy . 
  yeah , but again , contribution to the mechanism . 
  like greece contributed 2.8 b. 
  it 's not a loan . 
  oooooh , now i get it . 
  sorry , brainfart . 
   no , the united states did not lend a dime . 
  slovenia on the other hand did . 
  your country did not . 
  efsf/efsm did . 
  your country participated with $ 3b guarantee on efsf . 
  ours also participates with $ 21.9 b guarantee on efsf . 
  not a loan . 
  ** a guarantee . 
  ** efsf/m also lended to ireland and portugal and will lend to whichever country needs it .

  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltaawrkhnqa ) not that it would be a `` trick '' for someone to say that . 
  is there any relevant eu politician who feels otherwise ? 
  most if not all adhere to sch\u00e4uble 's position . 
  it would n't make a difference nor would it be unexpected if an american president claimed the same . 
   it 's different because jews are not a nationality , jews are an ** ethnic group ** . 
  you can have both a nationalistic and a religious approach to being jewish . 
  that 's why you can have humanistic judaism or jewish seculars etc. 
  and that 's why a map that proposes that 45 % of a population is antisemitic simply because they answered yes in 6/11 idiotic questions is itself an insult . 
  when jewish people themselves ca n't really distiniguish between the ethnic , nationalistic and religion aspect of judaism , asking questions of the type :  jews are more loyal to israel than to [ this country/the countries they live in ] and expecting a goy to make that distinction or be branded as antisemitic is ludicrous . 
  or it 's totally bullshit . 
  it 's based on questions of this type :  jews are more loyal to israel than to [ this country/to the countries they live in ] answering yes is considered anti-semitic . 
  when i read jew and israel in the same sentence my first thought was * not * of the religion but of the nationality . 
  is it `` anti-american '' to think that a greek living in america would be more loyal to greece ? 
  is a polish living in the uk anglophobe ( or whatever is called ) if he 's more loyal to poland ? 
  that 's stupid and somewhat loaded questions . 
  countries with high `` national pride '' and/or large migration histrory are deamed to answer this question differently than the others .

  how on earth do you know if he 's not culturally british ? 
  did he skip tea time ? 
   face , accent , hair . 
  yeah ... right . 
  not because his name is greek and it 's plastered on the youtube comments . 
  i 'm greek and ** i ca n't ** tell that he 's greek by the accent . 
  why ? 
  because he has ** no ** greek accent , he 's brit , he was born and raised in the uk .

  where the fuck do they get these numbers ? 
  the minimum daily wage in greece is $ 22,83 per day ( $ 510,95 per month ) , so $ 2,85 per hour . 
  using today 's dollar to euro ratio , that 's $ 3.38 .

  ** greece : f-16 's ( block 50 and block 52 + ) and mirage 2000-5 mk2 : 113 turkey : f-16 's block 50 : 30 greece : f-16 's ( block 30/40/50 ) and mirage 2000 egm/bgm : 92 jets turkey : f-16 's ( block 30/40/50 ) : 203 jets greece : f-4 pi2000 , f-4e / 2020 , f-4 rf and a-7e / h : 113 jets turkey : f-4 2020 , f-4e , rf-4e and f-5 : 144 jets in all , both countries have around 220 jets . 
  turkey has way more transport planes ( c130 and the like ) but it 's a far larger country . 
  ----------- so number wise , we have slightly less planes but more advaced ones . 
  heck , i 'll even say that yours is the more powerful one but only slightly . 
  but then you need to consider that in this scenario , turkey is the aggressor . 
  can your airforce commit * all * forces into offense ? 
  can you imagine what superiority you need as an aggressor ? 
  yeah , no . 
  you would probably win a drawn out war , but only because of ground army numbers and support . 
  your navy/air force are pretty comparable to ours but they 'd get decimated offensively . 
  shit , do n't need to believe me , check [ the numbers yourself ] ( https://www.militarytoday.net/hellenic-vs-turkish-air-force/ ) and read up on what happens when two similarly equipped forces meet , with one having defensive advantage . 
  what kind of numbers do you need to effectively secure a victory . 
  look , there are some things in life that are binary . 
  morality is one of them . 
  i mean that 's what morality is , right ? 
  the distinction between `` right '' and `` wrong '' .
