  it 's either right , or wrong . 
  you might have great reasons , you can be justified or it might be a silly thing , but the distinction still exists . 
  some things are right , some things are wrong . 
  the question was in simple terms , `` is cheating wrong ? '', 
  as i 've tried responding to many people already , it 's not about how big a deal it is - i get it , in france it might not be a big deal - but it 's about * if it 's wrong * . 
  the responses in the research show that a large number of french people think it 's * not * . 
   for an action that common , that 's ending up judging a whole lot of persons . 
  the action and the people doing it are related whether you like it or not . 
  again , you 're not asked to judge a person . 
  you 're asked to judge an act . 
  `` do you think theft is bad '' is the question . 
  not `` do you think thieves '' are bad . 
   i mean , if you answer yes while having a friend who cheats/cheated , you pretty much become a hypocrite instantly . 
  why ? 
  is there a social law that says if your friend done something immoral she/he should n't be your friend or you must denounce him/scold him/whatever ? 
  sure you 'd be a hypocrite if you claimed that all your friends are saints . 
  but people are not perfect . 
  nor are they expected to be . 
   this is private matters concerning only the persons directly involved . 
  they 're not asking to peek into the lives of strangers and judge them . 
  i do n't understand why you think this has anything to do with prying into someone 's personal life . 
  a certain unknown individual , whom you do not know , will never meet cheats on his wife . 
  should he feel bad ? 
  not do you believe he 's a terrible person . 
  not should you know if he cheated or not . 
  if the act he committed is immoral . 
   cheating is also common but everyone is ready to judge it because people love trying to get the moral high ground by saying something is morally unacceptable , even though they probably associate with people who do it . 
  the last part i already answered . 
  people are not perfect and are not expected to be . 
  but for the first part : ofcourse we 're ready to judge it . 
  for god 's sake , the person betrayed his other half . 
  he should feel bad . 
  i 'm not saying we need to know if someone did it . 
  i 'm not saying the person who done it is bad . 
  i 'm saying that the person who done it should feel bad . 
  because it 's fucking immoral . 
  it 's not ok . 
  if i did it myself , i should also feel bad . 
  it 's not a moral `` high ground '' . 
  that 's depressing . 
  17 years sentence for ~ ~ criticizing the government ~ ~ violating a construction code that 50 % of the people do n't follow . 
  yeah but no one is saying it 's unforgivable or anything . 
  just immoral . 
  i mean that 's what they 're asking . 
  do you consider it immoral to have an extra marital affair . 
  if society treated sex as something not intimate , if a blowjob had less meaning than a foot massage , sure , i could understand saying it 's not immoral . 
  but when even paid sex - which is mostly devoid of intimacy and is purely filling `` physical needs '' - is considered a breach of trust when it 's perpetrated by a married person , shit , you ca n't say cheating is not immoral . 
   i 'd rather hear about a couple cheating on each other than driving each other miserable . 
  yeah ... fucking someone besides your wife/husband ai n't exactly my prime solution to a couple being miserable with their marriage . 
  if for some reason i cared , i 'd rather them talk about it , do therapy or heck , even take a break . 
   as long as you consider that a couple of adults should handle their problems , and not just rely on social pressure . 
  if i was so shallow that i cared more/only about what the neighbors think than what * i * think , then i 'd simply tell her to be more subtle . 
  which probably is very similar to an open relationship , but for the wrong reasons . 
   so the question is not about being unfaithfull . 
  how can a married man have an affair but not be unfaithful ? 
   morality always implies that it is a matter that concern society as a whole morality is the distinction between `` good '' and `` bad '' . 
  the only connection society has with morality is that in general - but not always - what society considers `` good '' is what you come to believe is morally good and vice versa . 
  consider this : everyone but a person and his dog is dead . 
  that person grew up with what we consider our values , and he shares them , but in a fit of despair , he hit his dog . 
  there is no society to judge him , yet morals exist in him . 
  he feels * bad * after hitting his dog . 
   morality always implies that it is a matter that concern society as a whole , but i could n't care less you 're putting it like if something is considered immoral ( or moral ) , it should be a matter of concern for everyone . 
  as i pointed out in my example that is n't the case . 
  the question is not `` should you or the society give a shit about people cheating . '', 
  but is the act of cheating immoral ( by your definition of morality ) . 
  is it `` bad '' . 
   what you consider the most common , may not be the most common in france . 
  but i * asked * what was more common in france . 
   ...  since they 're not defining which of the two options they 're talking about , we must assume they 're talking about the most common one . 
   in your opinion , which one would it be ? 
  if it is different than my `` old fashion '' vision , then sure , i 'll renege . 
  if a single french person says to me , yes , it 's more common in france that married couples have open relationships than one side `` cheating '' , sure i 'll understand the high percentage . 
   there are many people who stay married for a while after being separated , and there are many people funding a familly without marrying . 
  they are not talking about separated people , nor simple relationships . 
   being married and being in an exclusive relationship are 2 separated things . 
  you 're telling me that what your `` textbook '' definition of being married is not tied up to having an exclusive relationship ? 
   some people will see the question as being about marriage , and some people will consider it 's about unfaithfullness . 
  the question is pretty clear it 's `` married people having an affair is morally unacceptable '' . 
  `` married people having an affair '' is the act `` morally unacceptable '' is the adjective . 
  it 's not married but separated , married but in an open relatonship nor married but widowed . 
  it 's not about marriage in general , its about the act of `` married people having an affair '' . 
  if someone asks you do you eat sausages , he 's asking you if you eat sausages , not if you eat meat . 
   the question is not about you but about marriage in general . 
  the question was about ** having an affair while married ** . 
  a very specific part of marriage and not `` marriage in general '' . 
   people do n't care what the neighbor is doing in france . 
  again , that was not the question . 
  the question is `` married people having an affair ** is ** morally unacceptable '' . 
  and not `` married people having an affair ** are ** morally unacceptable '' . 
  they 're asking you to judge the action , not the person . 
    but behind the back of your wife/husband ? 
   that was not part of the question . 
  they 're asking about married people having affairs . 
  there can be two options : 1 . 
  ... with the other one knowing ( essentially open relationship ) . 
  ... without the other one knowing . 
  since they 're not defining which of the two options they 're talking about , we must assume they 're talking about the most common one . 
  in your opinion , which one would it be ? 
   it all depends on how you interpret the question . 
   breaking the marriage vows : no morale issue for most french people .
