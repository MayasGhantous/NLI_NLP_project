  there is nothing sacred about marriage . 
  the question was about ** having an affair ** while married . 
  a very specific part of marriage . 
  i doubt the research was asking about opened relationships though . 
  should n't they have clarified that if that were the case ? 
  i mean opened relationships are ** really ** uncommon compared to your run of the mill `` behind the back of your other half '' affair . 
  i do n't get it . 
  what 's the point of marriage then ? 
  getting the tax reduction ? 
  sure it 's fine for the couples that consent to having affairs , to spice things up . 
  but behind the back of your wife/husband ? 
  how is that not immoral ? 
  it might as well started from that , i ca n't claim the origins . 
  but at least in greece and in my regions , ** it 's not worn ** because of religion for at least 20y . 
  i have two * very * religious women in my family/circle , one being 65 + another 30ish , they do n't wear one . 
  in my father 's backwater village in the `` country '' when i was a kid , they still attended church most sundays , apart from older women , it was not worn . 
  and lastly , again in my village , every 15th of august there 's a religious event on a church in the mountains with lots of pilgrims and people sleeping in the mountain , again , apart from grannies no one wore that . 
  i ca n't tell about other regions of greece or other countries , but my own experiences point to no , it 's not religious . 
  yeah , yeah exactly !, 
  just in case you want a picture , it 's essentially the bandana [ old ] ( https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/t/%ce%b7%ce%bb%ce%b9%ce%ba%ce%b9%cf%89%ce%bc%ce%ad%ce%bd%ce%b7-%ce%b3%cf%85%ce%bd%ce%b1%ce%af%ce%ba%ce%b1-%ce%bc%ce%b5-%cf%84%ce%bf-%ce%bc%ce%b1%ce%bd%cf%84%ce%af%ce%bb%ce%b9-%ce%b3%ce%b9%ce%b1-%cf%84%ce%bf-%ce%ba%ce%b5%cf%86%ce%ac%ce%bb%ce%b9-13799038.jpg ) , [ modern ] ( https://ipop.gr/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/scarf-ulyana.jpg ) it has some of the modesty components of a hijab but without the religious parts . 
  it 's not connected with religion at all , apart from the fact that because of the need to be/appear `` modest '' , women who attended church wore one . 
  apart from grannies and maybe some fashion statements , you wo n't see anyone wearing it though anymore . 
  attention to detail : even the aryan 's shit is a swastika . 
  do you even understand the graph ? 
  the baseline is 100 , that 's the `` ulc '' of the country at 2000 - the year . 
  at say 2009 , germany 's ulc is at 90 % of what it was at 2000 . 
  ulc ( 2009 ) / ulc ( 2000 ) = .9 do you understand ** now ** that it does n't fucking matter ? 
  or are you going to continue this charade ? 
  it 's the same fucking thing . 
  it 's ** relative ** . 
  that 's why the graphs started from 100 . a/b = ( a/x ) / ( b/x ) , b , x \u2260 0 ok now hotshot ? 
  whatever you say . 
   they can be expressed as the ratio of total labour compensation per hour worked to output ** per hour worked ** ( labour productivity ) . 
  [ oecd ] ( https://www.google.gr/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=8&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahukewjl57gakkjvahujfrokhqwga90qfghhmac&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fdata.oecd.org%2flprdty%2funit-labour-costs.htm&amp;usg=afqjcngi5l5qm6gz0ta_s5irj2hlytzmka ) despite that , does it matter ? 
  you 're saying it 's a , i 'm saying it 's a devided by a constant . 
  are we going to be * that * anal ? 
   it 's the ratio of the wage per time worked to gdp / ( no of workers ) for that time how is it different ? 
  yes , but here 's the thing and why these kinds of graphs need to remain in the hands of economists . 
  when you and i say productive , competitive or efficient , we mean the adjective . 
  the opposite of lazy | overpaid | not doing stuff right . 
  they 're not . 
  they 're simply ** mathematical expressions ** . 
  a german is no more productive ( adjective ) than a spaniard , an italian or a brit . 
  they are more productive per the economic term however . 
  why ? 
  because their economy is huge and that number ( productivity ) is derived from their gdp . 
  the larger the gdp the higher the productivity rate . 
  but here 's the problem : calculations that involve gdp are heavily favoring industrial countries . 
  and it makes sense , right ? 
  a factory worker will produce more value than a waiter or a fisherman . 
  ----- that 's why i do n't think much about those graphs . 
  let me make it more simple ( but obviously not * exacty * correct ) : say you have a country where the average wage is $ 15/hour . 
  that country 's gdp ( how `` much '' that country is making per year ) is $ 100b , their workforce is comprised of 2m people . 
  with 1 $ of their money they can buy stuff worth $ 1.2 --------- for that country you 'll have gdp/number of workforce = 100b / 2m = 50k per year * that essentially means each worker produces 50k per year for his country . 
  * making it from per year to per hour ( 1y = 2048 work hours ) 50000/2048 = 24.41 per hour . 
  so he 's making 24.41 per hour for his country but he 's being paid 15 per hour . 
  if we divide his wage ( 15/h ) by what he 's making his country ( 24.41 / h ) , you get an indication of how well he 's been paid to how much `` total '' he makes . 
  so in this instance 15 / 24.41 . 
  the smaller the number , the less the worker is being paid and/or the more he 's making total for his country . 
  divide that 15/24 .41 with 1.2 for his purchasing power ( remember in his country with 1 euro he can buy 1.2 euro of stuffs ) and you get something to compare against with other countries . 
  and that is what the graph is about . 
  it 's the ratio of the wage per time worked to gdp / ( no of workers ) for that time , adjusted for purchasing power . 
  how can you compare `` labour costs '' between different types of economies ? 
  they 're comparing heavy industry 's output for example to a service industry 's output . 
  just to point out how * stupid * that comparison is : tavern : 10 workers paid $ 300/month , tavern makes $ 30k cost of labour per $ of output : 0.1 factory :100 workers paid $ 3000/month , factory makes $ 5m cost of labour per $ of output : 0.06 hey , the tavern workers are overpaid and are not competitive !, 
   i like how they are using the greek crisis as a symbol of `` germany badgering other countries on moral grounds '' . 
  i remember reading that lots of other eu nations were in favor of treating greece harsh , or even harsher than what germany wanted . 
  yes , because how * others * treat someone is a justification for one 's behavior . 
  dude is talking about the irony of german politicians riding the moral pole when their larger corporations are just as corrupt as any other . 
   also they attack siemens over the turbines sent to crimea . 
  did n't a purchaser send them to crimea behind siemens back ? 
  yes , very surprising to attack siemens , the epitome of an honest , non corrupt corporation . 
   when happens when germany calls for it , but then finland and a number of other countries say they wo n't do it . 
  does germany bear the burden alone , or with a small group of countries ? 
  that would drop a couple of percentage points in polling from the ruling government in any supportive countries . 
  everything revolves around what is the gain ( or the loss of not taking the action ) in this situation . 
  i stipulate that in this event , most of the creditors ' interests will be aligned . 
  it will not be * just * germany whose interest it will be to forgive the debt . 
  it will be germany 's , france 's , italy 's and so on , so , whatever `` minor '' opposition a country may provide , it will be stifled by sheer pressure . 
  imagine the situation under which debt forgiveness was needed * and * it was beneficial/preferred by most creditors . 
  i can only imagine the situation where shit has hit the fan ** so hard ** , that the large creditors would actually prefer to erase a debt than to allow the situation to continue . 
  under * that * situation , who would oppose ? 
  heck , their own citizens would probably advocate for it . 
   it 's basically what has been happening . 
  yes , that 's why i used it as an example . 
  however this payment schedule was created as a middle ground between what ecb/imf thought greece can pay without wrecking the economy and what * does not * constitute a deep debt relief . 
  in the event that debt forgiveness will be granted in any serious way , that would mean simply that greece ca n't cope with those payments even at their current form . 
   i think i never saw free plastic bags in a ** german ** supermarket \u0399 have n't either . 
  ( lidl is the only supermarket in greece that i 've been that ** does n't ** have free plastic bags - though from 2018 none will ), 
  you 're correct in that you 'll be simply substituting supermarket bags with bin bags . 
  * however * , since you 'll be paying for the thing , you 'll probably pay more attention and actually fill the bag . 
  plus from some paper towel math and dodgy sources , a bin bag holds 4-5 times the volume of a typical super market bag while using only twice the plastic ( average weight 50g , holds ~ 118lt vs 25g and holds ~ 22lt ) . 
   the eu is forbidden to forgive debts by the non-bailout clause as the imf wont forgive debts according to its statutes either . 
  we 're talking * if * . 
  plus , let 's be real here , we 're talking semantics . 
  you can have the effect debt forgiveness without actually giving `` debt forgiveness '' . 
  spread the payments to 200 years , zero interest , bam , debt forgiveness within the `` rules '' . 
  i mean , it 's not the first time ecb skirts their rules . 
  also , who cares about imf , they hold peanuts compared to ecb and the rest of the eu . 
   anyway greece already has to pay less interest on its debts than germany thanks to the cheap loans provided by the eurogroup .
