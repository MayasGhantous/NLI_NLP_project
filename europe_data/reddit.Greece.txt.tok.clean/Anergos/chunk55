  it is also in greece 's well understood self interest to be able to economically stand on its own feet instead of becoming always more depending on the eu through an additionally quarelling and undemocratic transfer union . 
  again , what 's your point ? 
  why does every time a greek talks about debt forgiveness , you people feel the need to point out that `` greece already has received x and y and z '' . 
  ** nowhere in my comment am i asking for debt forgiveness , nor do i stipulate that it 's the correct thing to do . 
  ** i simply stated that if it 's not to the advantage of the other parties , debt forgiveness will not be given . 
  i did n't say they * should * . 
   it would be necessitate some very small changes in eurozone country 's budgets , nah . 
  a head of a german bank or something said that even if we were to default , it would change nothing as far as germany is concerned , as the cost has already been taken care of . 
  so , i assume the same stands for a total debt forgiveness . 
   in long-term , who knows ? 
  it may be a very dangerous precedent . 
  it 's not that , either . 
  consider that a country must be willing to reach our levels of economic destruction in order to qualify . 
  and we have fared pretty well due to how our society is constructed ( family bonds etc ) . 
  consider how us fared during the great depression and how greece , [ on paper our situation has been slightly worse ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/09/business/international/is-greece-worse-off-than-the-us-during-the-great-depression.html ) but the effects have n't been that hard for greece ( yet ) . 
  it will be * extremely * unlikely an eu country will ever reach the level of that precedent . 
  -- the only reason there 's no debt forgiveness is that it 's simply not to the benefit of the parties involved to grant one . 
  if the situation gets that worse that the benefits of granting debt forgiveness will outweigh the loss , you can be sure they will grant it . 
   raise prices . 
  they ca n't . 
  big hotels and many businesses in general around those hotspots are owned by conglomerates , that native people need to compete against . 
  those companies have cheap destinations , prime destinations , family destinations etc in many different countries . 
  they control such a big piece of the pie that changing focus to cater a prime tourist in greece will simply mean losing those prime tourists from somewhere * else * . 
   then why do the regions have lower numbers , than all of the countries that those region consist of ? 
   that is literally impossible . 
  well , if they omit countries that have say very low or close to zero but include them in the region averages it might happen . 
  i mean eu `` average '' is the same , in almost all charts eu average is `` on the low side '' because generally they simply omit countries with very small results in such tables . 
  not saying it 's correct , right or flawless , but simply how it can happen . 
  i do n't see the problem , it 's just a slight inconvenience . 
  sure , a certain matt hancock with the id number 0123456abc ( or whatever ) , will be registered as viewing 70 % of all the porn being watched in the uk but it 's no problem . 
  i 'm sure an addon of the browsers that autofills the form with his contact details will arrive shorty after the measure comes into effect . 
  the inconvenience will be short lived . 
  here 's a solution to both your imaginary scenarios and all of mine : 1 . 
  fyrom chooses a name that does n't promote claims to another country 's lands/heritage . 
  -- if nato and eu membership is so important to the well being of their country , if they know that the name/heritage thing is bullshit , why do they still support those politicians that promote it ? 
  if their country 's choice is ( well being + different name ) or ( poverty + fake history + name ) , why is greece to blame for their politician 's choice ? 
   you guys seem to think the end of # 2 is that macedonia becomes balkan hitler and decides to exterminate all the greeks . 
  but why would they do it ? 
  war destroys your own country . 
  happy nations do n't make war on neighbours . 
  for once our politicians have actual foresight . 
  what if in x years their country , being recognized as the actual macedonia all that time , starts pushing claims on greek parts ? 
  what if at the same time , our population declines but the minority that identifies as the fyrom of now - living in * our * macedonia - keeps growing ? 
  what about the culture of hate that will bring towards greek people ? 
  if you hammer for 50 + y into the minds of people something , it will become the truth . 
  lastly , what if a private collector has alexander 's whatever and wants to return it to its rightful place . 
  where should it be ? 
  in a museum in northern greece or in a museum in fyrom ? 
   every nation puts their own story or propaganda into history class . 
  sure . 
  and most of the nations do n't have issues with it because it ca n't affect current ( or future ) state of affairs . 
  but when you have a country naming themselves what has been essentially the geographical name of a whole region , most of it being outside of their actual national borders , then teaching to their children that * they * are the rightful owners of that whole region , then things get dicy . 
  add the fact that they appropriated another country 's history - which is bound to become a problem ( resolving antiquity disputes etc ) and you get the point . 
  you see what they 're counting on is people not understanding the true ramifications of that naming choice . 
  oh , it 's just the name , bad greece is bullying that small nation , let them be etc etc. 
  well , no . 
  because in 20-50-whatever years we ** will ** have a problem . 
  i 'm all for letting them choose whatever fricking name they like . 
  as long as it can bring no claims or disputes , border or otherwise . 
  the attackers were n't even greek . 
   media report that a brawl broke out between the american tourist and his friends and a group of serbian nationals, 
   pay denbts this is trademarked to greece . 
  you owe $ 1 to the greek government . 
  but just for you , 20c with no receipt * wink * * wink * . 
  let me explain how some parts of the banking sector work as simply as i can : banks in order to function need collateral . 
  those come in various forms , one of them being loans . 
  what happens when a bank over extends itself and a single loan is a big part of their collateral ? 
  if the borrower defaults , the bank might have trouble functioning and could be in need of a loan itself , in order to raise capital to use as collateral . 
  but what happens when the other banks have the same problem ? 
  that would mean that raising money will be * expensive * . 
  that would mean investor uncertainty . 
  that would also propagate the issue further into a circle . 
  so , now you 're saying that germany very well could have lent ( or `` given '' as you put it ) money to the banks to save them if that would happen . 
  well , here 's the problem . 
  they 'd either have to lend them before the banks actually need it , or after . 
  if the banks took a loan from mama germany , that would mean they * need * a loan from germany , that would mean they 're in trouble , investor uncertainty circle yada yada . 
  if the banks took the loan after , that would mean the banks had already failed . 
  that the damage was done . 
  that money would be spent on repairing that damage . 
  recovering the public trust etc. 
  germany did the correct thing for germany . 
  they did not let it happen at all . 
  that 's why they bought the loans from them , that 's why the same year all those systems were put in check so something like what almost happened , wo n't happen . 
  yeah , i 'm not a bad person . 
  only dishonest . 
  but it 's just this instance , so it 's ok . 
  there was no content about trump in my followup messages . 
  it went from judging trump 's persona to judging ** me ** . 
  from defending my views to defending me . 
  there was nothing important to trump 's followers or non followers in our and other conversations apart from the fact that if you dare judge trump - even his mannerisms - , his followers will shred you to pieces . 
  and this is why i 've deleted my comments . 
  even hours after i said i 'll stop judging your clown , your ** still ** ca n't leave it be . 
  now go and twist this message as well and show how ** dishonest ** i am . 
  sexists . 
  it should be free for women as well . 
   i saw no one calling you that , look i do n't care that much to provide permalinks , feel free to look at the two-three trees under my original comment . 
   i simply do n't get people who delete comments because they were insulted . 
  it 's the internet , try getting thicker skin . 
  i did n't delete the comments because i was insulted . 
  i deleteted them because everytime i tried defending myself two new comments sprang with new insults , and it was going strong 14h after the fact .
