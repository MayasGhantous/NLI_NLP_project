  i 'm all in to have a debate but what 's the point when the other party 's only purpose is to effectively troll me . 
  well , i admit , i do n't care that much if you share my opinion of trumps charisma . 
  so instead of having to deal with deleting notifications or shifting through replies in case there 's one i actually care to read , i chose to simply delete the whole comment . 
  i 've been called racist , race obsessed , hypocrite , leftist , hater etc and what ever it was that you called me . 
  you won . 
  i ca n't defend myself from your kind of people . 
  how can i ? 
  i provide a reasonable argument and my comments get twisted . 
  as will this comment . 
  i simply said `` i ca n't stand the guy '' . 
  and i specifically added that i was not talking about this policies . 
  it was his mannerisms i could n't take . 
  but again , congratulations , you won . 
  you were right . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.arrangemy.com/wp-content/uploads/award.jpg ) -- and you know one of the funny parts ? 
  i still do n't understand the relevancy of your insult . 
  ok , you people won . 
  i will not criticize your beloved president again . 
  i hope this brings happiness and enjoyment to you . 
  maybe he meant that the supposition is not that they 're stealing stuff , but that they 're actual protesters ? 
  i mean , you ca n't really doubt that they 're looting . 
  let me translate this for you . 
   i 'm not talking about policies here btw , i 'm simply talking about the `` man '' . 
  thank you very much !, 
  ( well i knew what greenhouse flowers are but did not make the `` dies as soon as it is exposed to real world weather conditions . '', 
  connection to me ) so like , i 'm not used to the real world or something . 
  also , yeah , i understood it was probably meant as an insult - i was wondering if it was something similar to the phrase `` delicate flower '' , but it did n't make much sense . 
  i do n't know how fitting that expression is to the situation , but judging by the upvotes , it must be . 
  well , i 've been called worse things that that . 
  yeah , also cringe worthy . 
  and if he kept messing up , i 'd probably have the same issue that i have with trump . 
  but the difference is , that one is an exception . 
  from what i gather , today 's trump speech * was * the exception . 
  i 've deleted my critique on trump 's personna . 
  i was made aware i was wrong and that i am a racist or obsessed with race or some kind of flower . 
  sorry for the inconvenience . 
  please stop filling my inbox . 
  thank you . 
  and a bad one because he plays it like he represents `` greeks '' . 
  do n't pay any attention to him . 
  oh , this looks to be the same map as the one titled : `` share of adults who ** do not ** lie on surveys '', 
  i suspect that captain thought he could avoid being searched if he went in turkish waters . 
  i hope the turkish coast guard proceeds with the cargo search normally - and if he indeed carries drugs - is cought and handled properly . 
  ** press release from the hellenic coast guard ( translation by me ) ** during noon today , rhodes coast guard received an anonymous complaint that the c/s ship by the name `` act '' , under a turkish flag , was sailing in the sea area east of rhodes island was carrying narcotic substances . 
  the aforementioned coast guard was immediately mobilized , whose ship located the a ship `` act '' , sailing under a turkish flag in the marine area 3.5 nm northwest of rhodes , inside greek territorial waters . 
  the coast guard ship 's captain demanded from the cargo ship 's crew to sail towards the `` thirties '' bay in rhodes in order for a cargo check to take place . 
  the `` act '' 's captain refused the commands and sound signals from the coast guard ship which resulted in the coast guard firing warning shots , without however the cargo ship stopping its course . 
  on the contrary , the cargo ship `` act '' continued sailing and entered the turkish territorial waters at which point the coast guard ship ended pursuit . 
  the ship escaped in turkish waters . 
  it did not get boarded . 
  it 's common sense . 
  however if common sense is not enough : 1 . they demanded the cargo ship docked to port for cargo inspection - the cargo ship ignored the request . 
   the cargo ship named m/v act was carrying steel from the southern port of \u0130skenderun to \u0130zmit in the northwest when the greek coast guard called on the ship to divert its course to rhodes , turkey-based deniz haber ajans\u0131 reported . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.dailysabah.com/turkey/2017/07/03/greek-coast-guard-opens-fire-on-turkish-cargo-ship-in-the-aegean ) 2 . the coast guard warned that they will fire - the cargo ship ignored the request . 
   they then said they would shoot if we did n't stop [ source ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/greek-coast-guard-fires-warning-shot-on-turkey-flagged-freighter-in-aegean.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=115055&amp;newscatid=351 ) about 3 an 4  when the ship did not comply , the greek coast guard opened fire in the air , then onto the ship shooting on the air and at the ship are * separate events * . 
  else they 'd simply say they fired at the ship . 
  now we can split hairs with why they escalated from firing in the air to firing at the ship , but at some point we should use our brains a bit . 
   when the ship did not comply , the greek coast guard opened fire in the air , then onto the ship . 
  two other coast guard vessels arrived in the area from the nearby island of simi . 
  they did not fire `` warning shots '' on the ship . 
  they fired * at * the ship after that ship ignored the warning shots . 
  they demanded the cargo ship docked to port for cargo inspection - the cargo ship ignored the request . 
  the coast guard warned that they will fire - the cargo ship ignored the request . 
  the coast guard fired warning shots - the cargo ship ignored the request . 
  the coast guard fired upon the ship . 
   when the ship did not comply , the greek coast guard opened fire in the air , ** then onto the ship ** . 
  two other coast guard vessels arrived in the area from the nearby island of simi . 
  ** edit ** the greek coast guard issued a press statement which i have translated here : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6l0a6d/greek_coast_guard_fires_warning_shots_at_turkish/djqd6fm/, 
  artistically it 's nice . 
  but technically it 's not really competent , the illusion falls down pretty easily . 
  this is where the sun * should * have been based on the highlights on the buildings and ship . 
  http://i.imgur.com/slosmt4.jpg the color of the sea is also off etc etc, 
  it 's ** heavily ** photoshoped . 
  here 's a different variation , also shopped : https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1535/24475389372_361817a272_b.jpg, 
  mods ' office was black and white ... . . like their soul . 
  yeah but do you know that the original proverb did not actually mean that women need caressing/petting but * beating * . 
  -- as far as the sultan is concerned , i could n't care less about how he eats . 
  he might as well slurp spaghetti , chew with his mouth open and make those watery noises and i 'd still not care . 
  it 's not his table manners that matter but his actions as a leader of a nation . 
   actually you do n't have to , you can rescue them and bring them to an dedicated island that is used to process illegal immigrants . 
  food , housing , etc has to be provided . 
  illegal immigrants are free to leave back home from there , and even get paid for travelling back home , or they can apply for refugee status in one of the eu states and wait for an approval or rejection . 
   once the word is out that if you try to migrate illegally to europe you will be stuck on an island for months or even years , the flow of boats will stop magically . 
  that is the strategy successfully used by australia for the last few years . 
  this is what is has been happening all these years . 
  minus the `` dedicated '' island bit because you know , we have no spare islands lying around that can house 30k + immigrants . 
  instead we put them in camps on the main land . 
   'm suggesting to block them from entering greek waters . 
  do n't see how entering turkish waters is a requirement for that . 
  you ca n't block a boat with a boat . 
  and even disregarding that tidbit , they know that the coast guard is required to save them when they 're overboard . 
  they jump as soon as they 're in range of the vessel . 
   i jut wan na know what 's your plan if turkey unleashes all the refugees into europe like it was threatening to . 
  well , what you 're suggesting is n't realistic . 
  i have no plan , you ca n't have a plan , at least in the short term , without turkey 's cooperation . 
  sea borders are not land borders , they ca n't be walled off . 
  boats are not cars , they ca n't be blocked off . 
  i do have some suggestions though . 
  force a boat registry for larger than x m boats and create laws that treat owners of boats that are used in immigration as human traffickers . 
  create immigration centers near the source .
