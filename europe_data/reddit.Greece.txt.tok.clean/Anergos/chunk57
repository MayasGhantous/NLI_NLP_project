  spread the info that those centers actually accept and transit people safely to europe if they 're qualified . 
  send caught illegal immigrants to said centers immediately . 
  all immigrants would need to be processed there before setting a foot on eu soil . 
  etc etc, 
  i 'm more stopping the immigration flow than the next guy here , but christ , you people do n't know what you 're talking about . 
   everyone forgot why coast guard even exists . 
  the coast guard 's role is security , customs and search and rescue . 
  not immigration control . 
   we can just turn the boats with refugees back before they reach european waters * you * might think that * you * can . 
  the coast guard ca n't . 
  most countries have signed unclos , as soon as there is even a whiff that people 's lives are in danger they need to intervene . 
  what you 're contemplating is even worse because it will actively put them in danger . 
   and turkey wo n't be able to do a thing about that . 
  are you fucking shitting me ? 
  have you any idea what 's going on ? 
  we put a greek fucking flag on a greek fucking goat island and that almost got us into war . 
  you 're asking greek military vessels to invade their waters ? 
  and you think they wo n't be able to do a `` thing '' about it ? 
  i prefer hansel and gretel fairy tales better . 
  more realistic . 
  and of german origin . 
  might make sch\u00e4uble 's position more friendly . 
  yeah . 
  the only thing european is the title . 
  it shows a plane crash in kabul in afghanistan , a boat in brazil , the excavator drop in kentucky us etc etc. 
  the greek courts are as much `` greece '' as is the greek government . 
  you ca n't claim the greek government represents greece but the judiciary system does not . 
  they 're part of the same entity . 
  it requires foreknowledge that the source that provides the stream is illicit . 
  and in their own [ faq ] ( https://euipo.europa.eu/ohimportal/en/web/observatory/faqs-on-copyright-cy#15 ) ( euipo )  how do i know whether a work is offered legally or illegally online ? 
   it is not easy to know whether a work is offered legally or illegally online . 
  it lists some things that might indicate legality ; absence however of those indicating points of legality does not make a source illicit . 
  unless you confess , no one can prove you knew the source was illicit . 
  in this case not knowing * is * actually a defense . 
   four turkish f-16 , two cn-235 aircraft and a helicopter entered athens ' fir without submitting a flight plan , hndgs said , adding it recorded ** four violations of air traffic rules which developed into 71 violations of national airspace in several parts of the aegean ** . 
   the aircraft flew between chios and lesvos and exited athens ' fir south of samos , ** committing 31 violations of national airspace . 
  **  the two cn-235 entered athens ' fir without submitting a flight plan , the first flying between lemnos and lesvos and the second south of rhodes , ** committing 19 and 21 violations of airspace respectively . 
   an eu that respects itself should bring eu aircrafts at the greek borders ( which are eu borders too ) in order to make a statement . 
  it ca n't be done . 
  first consider the bureaucracy . 
  who will be in command , which military law will have jurisdiction etc. 
  then what would happen if the foreign pilots were to engage/be engaged and consider detriments/psychology of the pilots . 
  a greek pilot knows that if he engages and shoots down a turkish plane , it can mean war , for him , his family and his country . 
  are the stakes the same for the foreign pilot ? 
  lastly , even if the previous were n't an issue , we would n't even agree to that kind of help . 
  it sends a message , we ca n't take care of ourselves , we 're weak . 
  one reason for having an army is to project strength . 
  anyway , no , that 's not the way to go . 
  we 'll take care of our own borders . 
  but say provisions and technical support as a means to `` better guard the eu borders '' would n't be a bad idea . 
  there are plenty of reasons to distrust him even now , especially considering the germans are big on morality and rules . 
  the price he paid might preclude him from doing something similar but that does n't mean his * morals * changed because he got caught/punished . 
  -- there should not be second chances for politicians ; one fuck up can ruin the lives of millions of peoples . 
   considering what a menace hitler was to our continent , should n't we make at least a statue or something of the man who shot him ? 
  yeah , you would n't want to do that . 
  we do n't have ( knocks on wood ) religious terrorism in greece . 
  we do have assholes that ca n't seem to understand that [ this ] ( https://cdn.gasexpress.gr/media/catalog/product/cache/1/small_image/300x300/95ed0527d9d82436c8af868ad005935d/1/0/10-00560_2.jpg ) is meant to be used in [ this ] ( https://www.selectmarket.gr/image/cache/data/2_013844-250x250.jpg ) to make [ this ] ( https://www.chowstatic.com/assets/recipe_photos/28232_greek_coffee.jpg ) and not [ this ] ( http://press724.gr/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/gazakia.jpg ) . 
  interest/fees as % net of operational income . 
  if you want a simple explanation , it 's like this : total income : $ 200 ( greece pays $ 118 ) expenses : $ 100 profit : $ 100 greece 's fees accounts for 118 % of the profit . 
  i was just messing with ya for calling us over 30 , old fucks . 
  anyway , ( relevant ) politicians know about the internet . 
  they ca n't afford to * not * know . 
  which is worse than ignorance , because that means they 're being effectively lobbied by interests . 
  judges on the other hand ... that 's a different story . 
  * those * old fucks need some express tutoring on technology . 
   the old fucks over 30 not cool bro . 
  not cool . 
  well in turkey at the moment , that 's easier said than done ... 
   with your hypocrisy that 's ironic . 
   keep dicking around with your understanding of this article , well i understand the distinction between blame and accuse so i 'll be excused to think that i understand the article better than you . 
  also i understand the distinction between own and owe in which case ...  that you pay what you fucking own i do n't owe a thing . 
  my goverment does . 
   ( and in silence ) yeah , sorry great sultan , i will keep my opinion to myself next time . 
   mocking my english skills does not make your argument any better . 
  i am not mocking your english skills , sorry if i gave that impression . 
  i 'm just very blunt . 
  anyway , he will pay in the next elections . 
  sadly we 're running out of parties to vote for . 
  he 's doing what a typical `` politician '' would do . 
  he 's pilling up measures/reforms that the next goverment will have to issue , so his party might have a chance on the elections after this one . 
   called the article bullshit . 
  no you did n't . 
  that would have been totally acceptable . 
  this is what you said in regards to the article :  stop blaming other for your fuck up . 
  which the article does n't do . 
  what you mean by `` our fuckup '' is that we took more loans than we can afford . 
  the article accuses imf of making money on the crisis . 
  they do n't blame imf ( see the distinction between blame/accuse here ? ), 
  for the crisis . 
  somewhat ironic coming from a user by the name englishlexicology . 
  ** question : ** did n't they have a referendum and bravely rejected the deal ? 
  ** answer : ** ohhh no no , they accepted it with open arms , almost begging ... -- and even if we take your revised comment into consideration , your statement implies that the same people who voted no on the referendum were the same people who accepted the deal `` begging '' later on . 
   you want me to shed a tear for 8 years of fixing the shit they should have done by themselves after cashing on 40 years of european money ? 
  hell no . 
  i expect you to be able to read a fucking article for what it is and not `` pay denbts '' and `` it 's your fault '' every time . 
  maybe then , if you actually gave it a try , you 'll get a better understanding of what is happening . 
   the point of the article is to blame imf for making money on greek crisis . 
  accuse . 
  not blame . 
  the point of the article is to showcase that imf made money on the crisis .
