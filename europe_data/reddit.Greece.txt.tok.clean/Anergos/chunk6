  though just to be clear , manuel valls said that , it 's not clear if hollande meant the same . 
  france , germany , italy , belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands . 
  just in case someone was bored to read the article . 
  well we have our own , they 're the `` regular suspects '' , anarchists and so on , mostly looking to fuck things up on every chance they get . 
  not large in numbers but effective , as they blend with `` legitimate '' masses of protesters . 
  apart from that , there used to be football violence but not much anymore . 
  `` because they let us '' is a brilliant argument . 
  i 'm the one looking like a tit but someone suggesting that it 's ok to  continue to piss shit and fuck ourselves through your resorts on the med because they * can * is not . 
  it 's ok to go on a safari in africa and kill a couple of lions . 
  they 're profiting from it . 
  it 's ok to go to thailand or kenya and fuck a 14y old prostitute . 
  they 're profiting from it . 
   until then we will continue to piss shit and fuck ourselves through your resorts on the med . 
  and you 're able to stop that any point you wish . 
  i do n't accept any complaints about british behaviour abroad from any countries willingly profiting from it . 
  do n't complain then about your poor reputation in this matter . 
   i 'm saying why it 's happening , and placing the blame for this largely at the feet of local businesses and ultimately local governments . 
  it 's up to the individual to restrict himself if she/he ca n't handle it . 
  they 're adults , not children . 
  and just because the laws are lax it does n't mean they do n't need to be respected . 
  the establishments provide a cheap way to have fun and get drunk . 
  how you behave after being drunk is not the fault of the establishment . 
   do n't want it , do n't promote it . 
  simple as . 
  should lamborghini stop selling 600hp ridiculous cars because some people ca n't drive it ? 
  there are people who get shitfaced , go eat a souvlaki and sleep it off on the beech . 
  should we stop catering to those people because some others have problems with holding their drink ? 
  you know what would happen if the police stopped being lax and started arresting people in order to stop `` promoting '' said behavior ? 
  when the 19y old reads in the paper about brits being arrested he wo n't care about the actual reason . 
  he/she 'll read it as being arrested for having `` fun '' . 
   on the bright side of greeks-britons relations , there is the fact that lord byron , the poet , is a national hero in greece , because he died fighting as a volunteer in the war of indipendence against turks . 
  [ lord byron 's statue ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/lord_byron1.jpg ) in athens . 
  wait a minute there mate . 
  because you seriously have a misunderstanding of the whole thing . 
  i 've worked in malia , hersonissos and other tourist hotspots in crete . 
  it 's one thing to provide cheap ( and crappy ) drinks and it 's another to claim because they provide cheap and crappy drinks , it 's ok to mess shit up outside the premises . 
  what happens inside the bars is fine , acceptable and paid for ( well within reason ) . 
  but claiming they deserve to pee on the streets because the `` resorts '' are marketed as cheap vacation getaways is going too far . 
  as far as the  they look shitty , they lack basic sanitation , have poor services you 'll be glad to know that most of the bars in malia and hersonnisos are modeled after british / irish pubs and they employ mostly foreign people . 
  and really , when you pay $ 3-5 for a mix , what do really you expect ? 
  golden toilets and excellent service ? 
   try again . 
  that 's simply a property tax - the norm in all western countries we have * two * . 
  what you call [ property tax ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/property_tax ) , we had as a municipal tax . 
  we just added another for places with electricity . 
  and i am not complaining . 
  i am just stating the irony in saying that we 're not paying property tax because some places are not in the land registry . 
   that 's ridiculously low . 
  ** you talk the talk , but can you walk the walk ? 
  ** [ municipal tax ( for the house ) in red square ] ( http://i.imgur.com/m0r2tb2.jpg ) . 
  every two months , so 6 x 90.97 = $ 545/year [ enfia ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8ae5boo.jpg ) . 
  that 's for two similar apartments , so half . 
  1052/2 = $ 526/year . 
  545 + 526 = $ 1071/year for a 105m ^ 2 house . 
  so , show me your `` ridiculously '' higher one . 
  ** i dare you . 
  our political system is nothing ** but ** dynasties . 
  he `` served '' 4 times as pm . 
  his brother achilleas served as a minister . 
  constantine 's nephew of the same name served as a pm . 
  another nephew is michael liapis who served as a minister . 
  ** papandreou family . 
  ** george papandreou served 3 times as a pm . 
  his son andrew papandreou served as a pm . 
  his grand son george papandreou served as a pm . 
  ** mitsotakis family ** constantine mitsotakis served as a pm . 
  his son kyriakos served as an mp . 
  his son in law pavlos bakogiannis served as a parliamentary leader . 
  his daughter dora served as a minister and as a mayor . 
  etc etc, 
   and we have had taxes on land and houses , even when you do n't sell yes you have , the fastighetsskatt . 
  [ 2 ] do tell me how your ** max ** is compared to me paying for a small to medium house of 100m ^ 2 , $ 500 . 
  ** edit ** plus that 's your municipal tax . 
  we have that apart from enfia . 
   furthermore-why do n't greece have a finished land registry of you have received money for it in 1995 ? 
  because greece is not flatland . 
  it 's mountains and hills . 
  there are no natural boundaries . 
  nor do our properties form nice squares . 
  our deeds are from 40 's and 50 's . 
  want an example of such a deed ? 
  i own a piece of land and in the contract it 's something like this : the land starts from the road and extends till the creek . 
  it follows the creek till the rocks . 
  from the rocks it goes northwest till a tree . 
  for every piece of such land , an engineer or whatever must go there and actually measure the distances assuming there are no conflicts . 
  if there are conflicts , disputes or whatever , witnesses are called and if it 's not handled even then , it goes to the court . 
  that 's why it 's hard to make a real land registry in greece . 
  `` drink '' tourism would be my guess . 
  lots of youth coming for vacations and well ... they do n't exactly make a great impression . 
  plus the whole marble thing i guess . 
  what , france slightly negative here ? 
  i seriously doubt that . 
  even going by stereotypes , france has been philhellenes over the years and we love people who love us . 
  even looking at education , many of our schools teach french . 
   it does n't exist and they still do n't pay taxes ? 
  as mentioned in the article . 
  instead they have to pay some extra tax on the electricity . 
  it does exist but it does not cover all of greece yet . 
  the parts that it does cover is where the land has actual value though . 
  the link provided from / u/mfukar is actually that .
