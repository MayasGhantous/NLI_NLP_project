  the land registry has ** nothing to do with taxes ** . 
  let me say it again , ** nothing to do with taxes ** . 
  it has everything to do with doing business in greece , land disputes and such , but not with taxes . 
  as in all countries , taxes are paid when lands exchange hands . 
  when you sell , transfer , lease etc the lands . 
  as an added bonus , we have a tax that no other european country to my knowledge has . 
  in greece they implemented an emergency levy that was supposed to be temporary and it 's applied to every home with electricity . 
  so in other countries you pay a tax once when you buy the house and that 's that . 
  in greece , you pay that tax and you have the yearly enfia tax as an added bonus . 
  for example , for my house , a 105m ^ 2 , i pay $ 500 yearly for the privilege of owning a home . 
  that 's apart from the original tax i paid when the deed was transferred to me , and apart from whatever municipal taxes i pay for my house as well . 
  yeah . 
  as a foreigner you will not be limited in your transactions . 
  2 ) that would be advisable . 
  3 ) yes . 
  i would have said about glezos and his recitation of a part of euripides ' tragedy in ancient greek but honestly , how can one beat janusz korwin-mikke ? 
   women are dumber than men and should not be allowed to vote . 
  evolution has ensured that women are not too intelligent . 
  after all , no intelligent being would last more than an hour a day with a baby and all its goo-goo ga-ga gibberish .

  my bad . 
  imagine a europe where union politics was favored and sovereign politics was moved to the background . 
  how strong a negotiating position the new union would be in . 
  from simple things like army organ\u03b9zation and deployment to an esa with actual budget . 
  imagine an education system which promoted cultural exchanges , an erasmus in a totally different level . 
  imagine going to the louvre and be able to say , all these are * ours * , not * theirs * . 
  this is our history now . 
  but this is n't going to happen . 
  it 's evident we 're not ready and the crisis did n't help . 
  i applaud hollande for his vision and i welcome his efforts , but the people are not ready and our politicians have way too much to lose . 
  so , spain ? 
  let me preface this by saying i am not pro-syriza . 
  they did a bad job but i 'll get to that and how it is explainable . 
  -- austerity is one of the proposed set of policies that aim at deficit reduction . 
  as such , there is n't a single political party in greece , there is n't a single greek person who disagrees with the notion that greece needed some policies of austerity . 
  our budget was messed up and everyone acknowledges that . 
  the problem is with specific measures and how they were called to be applied . 
  anyone claiming that greece `` did n't try hard enough '' should be metaphorically slapped silly . 
  there has n't been a single country able to almost eliminate a 15 % budget deficit in 5 years time . 
  france has a ~ 4 % deficit and they 're asking for an extension to 2017 to drop it to the `` required '' 3 % gdp , just a 1 % drop . 
  the problem was that this was - and i am using varoufakis analogue - a bad medicine . 
  while it worked , it was full of destructive side effects . 
  so syriza 's promise was to try and negotiate a new package that eased on those side effects . 
  of course they would not go in a new spending spree , there are n't any money . 
  now something else , pretty minor , but still . 
  the `` troika '' did n't enable greece to spend $ 240bn more than it could have spend . 
  the banks did , they were the original lenders . 
  and that was n't the face value of the debt . 
  now enough with these things , let 's talk about syriza and what happened by starting with a little background . 
  ** ecb ** in order for central banks to provide liquidity to the banks , they need to have collateral , usually govt bonds . 
  but ecb does not accept junk rated bonds , which unfortunately the greek banks had . 
  however ecb bent their own rules and deemed they were acceptable . 
  that was till syriza came to power . 
  ** syriza ** syriza came to power with a promise of a new deal , a deal with better terms that would allow the greek economy to recover . 
  their tactics were pretty aggressive . 
  but they were amateurs in the negotiation and overestimated both their negotiating position and ecb 's stance . 
  they shouted left and right that they do not accept the 2nd bailout terms , that the program will not continue etc. 
  that was enough to push ecb to revoke their current stance of accepting greek junk bonds as collateral - even though nothing had actually changed in that regard . 
  syriza 's politicians did n't expect that . 
  that was during february i think , and that 's when things started going sideways for the new government . 
  greek banks had to rely on ela , which among other things has a bigger interest rate and can be frozen at a moment 's notice without special justification . 
  a 2/3 vote on ecb 's governing council and that 's that . 
  add the fact that greece did not have access to the markets , could not receive any of the bailout trenches , and the debt kept pilling on . 
  fast forward further fuck ups from varoufakis , the unexpected hard stance of the creditors , the * catastrophic * ela freeze and the idiotic referendum and we reach today . 
  ----- syriza * had * honest intentions . 
  i mean ** everyone ** knew that the debt was not payable . 
  they just had the balls to say it out loud . 
  but the way they went about things was amateurish . 
  syriza 's politicans are inept , that 's certain . 
  so now it 's time for a question : would you support the same old parties that partook in the destruction of the country for so many years now ? 
  that purposefully hid things from both the greek people and our european partners ? 
  or the new party that tried , with honest intentions , and failed miserably ? 
  with no experience against `` opponents '' such as schauble et.al ? 
  where are the sub 's german posters ? 
  need 1 cent . 
  willing to reform . 
   they are n't your partners . 
  greece , germany , finland , france etc are all partners in the eurozone . 
  tsakalotos , schauble , alexander stubb etc are all partners in the eurogroup . 
  tsipras , merkel , hollande , etc are all partners in the european council . 
  even if you put imf in and simply define two parties , the creditors ( ec/imf et.al ) and greece , both parties are part of the program . 
  everywhich way you look at it , they * are * our partners , one way or another . 
  come one syriza put your heart into it . 
  believe in the 3.5 % surplus and greece will make it !, 
  or you know , the reforms will either be applied or not . 
  and they will either work or not . 
  feelings have nothing to do with it . 
  it was 1933 , yeah her uncle at the time was probably influenced by the nazis , but she was 7 for god 's sake . 
  meh ... the blame game serves no purpose anymore . 
  yeah at first it was a way to let some steam off i guess , blame the greeks , blame the banks , blame the euro , blame the politicians . 
  but at some point , well , it 's enough . 
  let 's look forward shall we ? 
  no way . 
  they even had to drop prices here ( even though globally they raised prices due to the increased coffee cost ) due to competition . 
  \u0391n outlet that sells the same stuff `` gregorys / \u0393\u03c1\u03b7\u03b3\u03cc\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2 '' has 200 stores in athens alone . 
  that 's for people who want stuff for the road . 
  people who want to sit for coffee go to actual coffee shops . 
  the market is pretty well covered here in greece , between `` souvlakia '' for cheap food on the go , `` goodies '' for the plastic burgers , `` gregorys '' for baguettes/coffee on the go and normal coffee shops for sitting , there 's no space for starbucks and their overpriced crap . 
  no , i 'm not claiming you 're doing propaganda . 
  i do n't even know where you stand on this issue - i did n't read the whole thing .
