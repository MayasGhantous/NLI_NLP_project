  i just looked for the typical stuff i know not to be true - you know the actual propaganda stuff - so i would know whether it 's worth my time or not . 
  as it stands , my eyes fell on that tidbit and - sorry but - i decided it probably is n't worth my time . 
  i 'll restate that i care not if you use the name or not . 
  but i do n't like to have to shift through walls of text having to fact check everything . 
  yeah i know . 
  though it 's a bit fuzzy since merkel is leader of cdu and the cdu/csu coalition but seehofer is the chairman of csu . 
  so i do n't know how this plays into the politics - is the merkel line the hard party line in csu as well or is it similar to syriza/anel coalition we have here in greece ( ignoring the fact that the german parties are closer in the political spectrum than the syriza/anel coalition ) . 
  look i honestly do n't care about using the name , but if you 're going to put up so much work into a text , you might as well check the facts you 're claiming . 
   the funny thing is , greek geography books had it listed as `` macedonia '' before the 80 's and not `` skopia '' . 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7l6upoyazy4&amp;t=0m43s it lists greek geography school books from 1939 and onwards . 
  sadly the site that offered the books in pdf and html form ( oedb.gr ) has closed due to the crisis so it 's hard to find an online print of those any more . 
  so yeah , i 'll admit i did n't bother reading your whole text , but seeing that at a first glance you 're using the typical propaganda claims , i 'm not that hopeful . 
  souvlaki man . 
  i mean you can even tell from the pictures . 
  honestly , what would you rather eat , [ this ] ( http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.tacobell.com/static_files/tacobell/staticassets/images/food/foodtypes/slider_tacos_2_2013.png&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.tacobell.com/food/tacos&amp;h=370&amp;w=920&amp;tbnid=g1bvyxznvnchjm:&amp;docid=gzo6ojtygo45pm&amp;ei=sr2pvbcgh8ipsah54omaca&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=0cb0qmygamabqfqotcpdoi9m74sycfcghlaodexecga&amp;biw=1472&amp;bih=723 ) or [ this ] ( http://apokoronaslife.gr/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/%cf%83%ce%bf%cf%85%ce%b2%ce%bb%ce%b1%ce%ba%ce%b9.jpg ) ? 
  relax , take a deep breath , and re-read what i am asking . 
  i am not claiming they are wrong nor am i asking for justification , no need for you to rile up . 
  i just wanted to know what the no represented . 
  60 voted against and that 's from both from cdu and csu . 
  30 % cut on military operational costs . 
  37 % cuts on military salaries . 
  but you know what , we probably could do better . 
  [ our f16 have no spare parts , there 's no oil to move the tanks ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/spending-cuts-hurt-greek-defense-and-democracy/a-16686104 ) but we could do better ( no sarcasm ) . 
  but would the saves be better spent on hospitals ? 
  we did a 25 % cut there , [ hospital are out of bandages , scissors and sheets ] ( http://www.rt.com/news/261905-greece-hospital-supplies-austerity/ ) . 
  maybe the saves could be allotted to the schools . 
  [ 45 % cuts on the education ] ( http://www.psi-can-greece.org/news/impact-greece%e2%80%99s-economic-crisis-education-real ) system . 
  how about social security ? 
  helping the migrants ? 
  investing it for growth ? 
  fix the aforementioned problems with the firefighters ? 
  pay our debts ? 
  you tell me , where do we put the saves you propose ? 
  no , but the crisis has n't help . 
  we have fire-fighting vehicles without tires , our planes are [ 50y old ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canadair_cl-215 ) relics ( one had to do an [ emergency landing ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ckg_xs1wgaa8x0b.jpg ) today ) , most of the fire preventing measures have been scrapped to save money and you get the point . 
  die linke voted no because of the way the way the negotiations were handled right ? 
  and the 60 no from cdu/csu were because they thought that the new measures were money wasted ? 
  cheers , 
  errr , why do i see 484 no and 74 yes ... 
  thank you . 
  around 50 cdu meps voted against - as a parallel to the 30sthing of syriza . 
  was n't the vote roll-call ( named ) ? 
  do n't we know * who * voted what ? 
  starbucks ? 
  are you kidding me ? 
  we have like 18 stores in greece total ... goodies , the local fast-food outlet has 120 stores ... 
  it 's far from ideal , but there are concessions needed to be made . 
  there are lots of similar examples . 
  why for instance do n't buses have seatbelts ? 
  why do they allow people standing ? 
  why do n't you need to wear a seatbelt in cabs ? 
  etc etc, 
   what retarded bullshit is this , the earlier government were at least trying to repay their debt which made the ecb think it was okay , even though that is questionable . 
  ecb is not a teacher . 
  meh , this student is bad , but he 's trying so i 'll give him a passing grade . 
  ecb is the european central bank . 
  what they do affects millions of lives . 
  you ca n't have them bending their rules and unbending them at will . 
  i 'm speaking now as a european , not as a greek , they should not have given the greek banks the ok . 
  they 're making rules as they go ffs , ** that ** is retarded bullshit . 
  and now i 'll speak from the greek perspective . 
  if you realize that an exception must be made , instead of `` bending '' the rules , do a swap . 
  swap the bad bonds with good ones at a rate that is beneficial to you . 
  yeah , the greek banks collateral will get smaller but the rules will still be followed and the banks could still function . 
   through ela newly created ? 
  are we talking about newly created money/loans ? 
   are we talking about newly created money/loans ? 
  in most circumstances the ecb gives the directive to the bank of greece to print x money . 
  the order gets completed either in the greek mint , or in very dire situations , from abroad ( last time it was from austria ) . 
  if it 's abroad then it gets transported to greece via c130 airplanes . 
  else trucks loaded with cash gets trasported from the greek mint to the banks . 
  apart from that , the economic condition , the wars we 've been into , the civil wars we 've been into , the pollution , terrorism , bieber and socks / w sandals , we really do n't blame other countries . 
  i would be furious if i were him . 
  you have the central banks ( say bank of greece ) . 
  they provide liquidity to commercial banks according to their collateral ( say government bonds ) at an interest rate set by the ecb . 
  if they run out of collateral , they draw liquidity from the ela at a higher interest rate . 
  well what 's the catch ? 
  greek banks posted greek govt bonds as collateral . 
  which are junk status . 
  which is not acceptable collateral for the ecb . 
  ecb closed their eyes and pretended that there was no problem till syriza came to power and started rejecting the bailout terms . 
  then , they decided that it was not acceptable . 
  ( are n't we glad ecb does not take a political stance , right ? ) . 
  so the greek banks had to rely on ela . 
  the problem is that the governing council can restrict the ela at a moment 's notice with no real justification , just claim it 's according to the `` eurosystem 's objectives '' and that 's that . 
  ** edit : ** needs 2/3 majority vote in the council ** end edit ** well , freezing the ela in the first place was according the the eurosystem 's objectives . 
  giving 1bn more is according to the eurosystem 's objectives . 
  edit :  is it from thin air ? 
  it 's an actual loan , albeit at a higher interest rate . 
   simply put : syriza . 
   they have shown so much incompetence or outright lies ( for example what the referendum would lead to ) , yet are somehow still in office . 
  i am sorry , but you 're festering those feelings because of how the greek government chose to handle the situation the past 5 months and because they ... lied ? 
  do you even know who sch\u00e4uble is ? 
   i dont care if the greek actually think syriza is doing a good job or if they know what kind of failure syriza is , but there is simply no alternative . 
  sorry but what puts you in the position to know syriza better than a greek ? 
  are you that well informed ? 
  there is no alternative ? 
  really ? 
  do you want me to link to you 10 different proposals about how it could be done ? 
  or maybe read a history book , around 1953 in europe , it explains how an indebted nation became a powerhouse .
