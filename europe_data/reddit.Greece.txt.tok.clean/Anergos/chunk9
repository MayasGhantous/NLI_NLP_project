   ... greece and should bail the fuck out before we get dragged into this mess any further . 
  you * do * know that you were n't in that mess in the first place , right ? 
  you * do * know who transferred the privately held debt to sovereign hands , right ? 
  because it 's his proposal that you so violently support right now . 
   fundamental cultural issues have caused this mess are fixed . 
  what cultural issues exactly are you talking about ? 
   which means that i personally wouldnt mind if the ez cutting ties with greece gets ugly . 
  not wanting to have ties is totally different from wanting to humiliate them . 
  no , not really . 
  [ scorpios ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02533/islandaerial_2533108k.jpg ) ( scorpio ) on the other hand , being the private island of a millionaire whose family was filled with intrigue does fit the bill . 
  plus it has a `` villainous '' name . 
   but if greece refuses i dont mind humiliating them until they cant take it anymore and leave . 
  why do you feel this way ? 
  no really , what exactly has prompted such harsh feelings for a country i doubt you have any interaction with , apart from what you see on the telly ? 
  i like skyscrapers but sparsely built . 
  i would like to be able to see the sky without having to tilt my head if you know what i mean . 
  my thoughts exactly . 
  being beat by italians ? 
  what a blow this must be ... 
  it goes towards the talk about greek and german ethos , the assumption that greeks are predisposed to tax evasion but germans are n't . 
  under similar circumstances , nationality does n't matter . 
  i do n't think tax evading is a national treat . 
  i have no qualms in using statistics to support an argument ( why is n't it spelt argu ** e ** ment is beyond me ) provided it actually does that . 
  nah , i was having a laugh too , sorry for coming out that hard . 
  it felt like the `` proper '' response at that time but re-examining it now , it is out of character , i apologize . 
  you are correct about the plural form as well . 
  cheers . 
   i think you will agree that the banks are not solvent and that the problems are not temporary . 
  i agree with you .

  or at least he did n't , till a month ago . 
  it not only that . 
  for instance farmers were given incentives for early retirement by the eu for whatever reason . 
  common agricultural policy for community aid for early-retirement from farming i believe was the name of one such program . 
  ireland and france also were under that program if i 'm not mistaken . 
  it too heavily skews the data . 
   sets the interest rates at which it ** lends to commercial banks ** in the eurozone ( also known as the euro area ) , thus controlling money supply and inflation bolded part by the actual site , not me . 
  [ what does the ecb do ] ( http://europa.eu/about-eu/institutions-bodies/ecb/index_en.htm ) ? 
   highly unfamiliar to you greeks , certainly . 
  we are highly proficient in googling before making an ass of ourselves first though . 
   automation or automatic control , is the use of various control systems for operating equipment such as machinery , processes in factories , boilers and heat treating ovens , switching in telephone networks , steering and stabilization of ships , aircraft and other applications with minimal or reduced human intervention . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/automation ), 
  any man can make mistakes , but only an idiot persists in his error . 
  for the driver , yes . 
  for passengers i do n't think so . 
  that would mean you have to carry a second helmet everywhere you go and there is n't enough baggage space in a bike for two . 
  well , i * am * common , 
   why did n't greece just fix their problems in the first place ? 
  when they went broke the first time . 
  greek government_1 : hm , things are n't great . 
  but if we do cuts , we wo n't get re-elected . 
  let 's get some loans instead . 
  greek government_2 : hm , previous govt did n't do a good job . 
  things are dire . 
  but if we do cuts , we wo n't get re-elected , especially since last government did n't do cuts . 
  let 's get some more loans instead . 
  ... greek government_n : shit , things are critical . 
  what can we do ? 
  we ca n't get more loans , they 're into us . 
  however much we 'll cut , we ca n't pay the interest from the old loans . 
  let 's disclose to everyone the problem and hope for the best . 
  that 's the ballpark , if you also add the military and civil contracts you 'll get a more complete picture . 
  -- i wo n't comment on the europe being bad guy part . 
  nope . 
  usually they use years or weeks . 
  so hours worked per week/year . 
  yes , but considering the harm that is done each day the ela is frozen , increasing it by a small amount is a small risk to take . 
   greece runs a budget deficit every single year . 
  and not small ones , big ones - typically 10 % of gdp , with a high of 15 % of gdp in 2010 . 
  but i am not talking about greece . 
  jesus , how many times must i say it ... greece needs a balanced budget . 
  not all countries need a balanced budget . 
  am i talking greek all of the sudden ? 
  if we use them in conjunction with other data , it can provide a good indication about many things . 
  other data is pretty interesting by themselves . 
  i mean examining how the productive countries achieved their results and possibly gaining an insight of what could be done for other less productive countries is a pretty nice discussion subject . 
  but alas it will probably degenerate to `` work harder '' at a point ... 
  you 'll get no arguments from me on that . 
  sigh ... 
  i like how you post this response in a thread about not using statistics wrong . 
  back in 91 , germany had a 40 % debt to gdp . 
  was their economy back then stronger ? 
  or did you consider that we 're just exiting a global depression ? 
  did the global crisis of 2008 had anything to do with that ? 
  maybe the russian sanctions hurt the germans ? 
  did * anyone * of the aforementioned reasons have * anything * to do with how the germans run their economy ? 
  but i am not talking about greece !, 
  where did i say anything about greece ... am i not making myself clear , is my english this bad ? 
  my problems were with this part :  the amount of money earned in relation to the amount of money spent is an accurate indication for whether you are capable of managing your money or not . 
  the quoted part . 
  germany is running a deficit most of the years now . 
  does this mean they 're slightly not capable of running their money ? 
  i 'll quote * again * where my problem was . 
   the amount of money earned in relation to the amount of money spent is an accurate indication for whether you are capable of managing your money or not . 
  now , since you 've mentioned eu , does germany seem that they 're `` slightly '' not capable of managing their money ? 
  because from what i can tell , most of the past years they 've been running a deficit . 
  large amounts of deficit is not advisable , yes . 
  but making generalizations like the quoted part is ** wrong ** . 
  i am not arguing about greece . 
  where exactly did i talk about greece ?
