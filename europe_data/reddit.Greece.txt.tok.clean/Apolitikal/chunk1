i kind of agree but disagree as well . 
  i agree on the front of `` federalising '' europe . 
  imo we need to realise that we 're all in this boat together and if we all accept that and all start rowing we can reach our goals faster , more efficiently and with greater success . 
  i do n't feel the need however for an introvert europe . 
  we live in the most prosperous and peaceful region in the world . 
  human rights are respected here more than anywhere else . 
  i feel that we need to step up and shape the vision of the whole world 's future . 
  a `` nationalist '' europe may be good for short term but for the long term it would exclude us from the discussion of future challenges . 
  and some piece of advice for people who want to try and bring `` tsiknopempti '' in their own country . 
  you need to choose a piece of meat that produces `` tsikna '' when grilled . 
  that characteristic smell of burned fat , as it drips on the hot charcoal . 
  a few choices are lamb ribs and some cuts of pork . 
  avoid beef , chicken and cuts with little or no fat . 
  another important ingredient is to share with passerbys , 
  [ some alchemy i did to provide you with the very interesting article ] ( http://docdro.id/6umepnl ), 
  which one of these is besides being beautiful , full of cinemas , restaurants from every major cuisine , shopping malls etc ? 
  imo thessaloniki is the goldilocks city in greece, 
  exactly !, 
  you 're right . 
  iirc that 's pretty much what my friend had told me . 
  the urban planner responsible for rebuilding thessaloniki was ernest h\u00e9brard . 
  however a friend ( who is into this stuff ) once told me that the plan was left incomplete . 
  if it was completed , thessaloniki would be much more beautiful . 
  but you 're right , salonica has a special place in anyone 's heart . 
  the food , the people , the view . 
  fellow europeans , pay a visit to our `` co-capital '' . 
  it will be worth your time !, 
  here in greece , the same as you . 
  though i 've heard the rather peculiar one `` if my grandma/aunt had wheels , she would be a scooter '', 
  i am pretty young , but i do n't remember seeing that behavior any time before . 
  interrupting another leader mid sentence to comment on his remarks ? 
  above all , that 's also extremely disrespectful . 
  i do n't believe there would be any real consequences though . 
  i think erdogan is smart as a fox in diplomatic matters and knows very well when he is in a position of greater power . 
  else he would know better than to disrespect the most powerful woman in the world, 
  ok italians , we get it . 
  your country is beautiful . 
   no mate , do n't be that guy . 
  it was literally ** the greek people as a whole ** who wanted the turkish soldiers free , ** not only ** '' liberals progressive citizens or academics '' well , i ca n't remember any syriza or anel members ( the two governing parties ) campaigning against the extradition of the servicemen . 
  it was mostly people from the political centre and liberals who gave publicity to the case ( most notably mr. doxiadis ) . 
   never happend , that came from a turkish source only . 
  the greek pm said that the soldiers would have a fair trial based on the european values , nothing more nothing less . 
  as i said in a previous comment , i do n't remember that claim being disputed by the greek authorities ( ministry of foreign affairs , or the pm 's office ), 
  that statement indeed came from turkish sources , but it was n't disputed at the time by greek authorities . 
  very important decision . 
  the pm of greece , just a few days after the attempted coup , had reassured president erdogan that those 8 eight servicemen would be extradited to turkey , in attempt to strengthen relations between the two countries . 
  however , many liberal and progressive citizens , writers , academics and politicians have argued that no matter the status of the bilateral relations , the greek and european rule of law can not be bent . 
  they argued that these people not only were they just soldiers on a search and rescue mission , without any knowledge of the coup but if they were extradited they would be tortured and would n't be given a fair trial . 
  the current government especially is of the idea that there are no illegal immigrants , everyone is a refugee fleeing from situations created by imperialism , capitalism etc. 
  so first of all they do n't want to crack down on these hubs , because it will create turmoil within the party . 
  previous governments , lacked the tools and the proper infrastructure ( as is with pretty much everything here ) and they also had to deal with the left ( which now is the ruling party ) which argued about everyone being victims of the neo-liberal , neo-imperialistic , neo-capitalistic , neo-eu , neo-whatever policies . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_paros_beating_and_rape check this out as well . 
  this case has had much coverage here in greece and everyone feels deep anger about that incident . 
  the girl still struggles with the rehabilitation process but her mother has recently given an interview admitting that myrto will never be the same . 
  i once read somewhere that there is an organization with pretty much global presence that promises the resurrection of dead people . 
  populism these days ... 
  not at all . 
  tsipras is a dubious character himself . 
  to sum it up for you in a few words . 
  tsipras and his party , along with the whole leftist side of the political spectrum have been expressing a series of arguments for many many years . 
  anti-open market , anti-nato , anti-eu , anti-euro whatever . 
  everything that has been common sense in every other european country , has been their ideological enemy . 
  but after they came to power ( after roaming around the 3-4 % for at least 20 years ) their history came and collided with reality . 
  their whole system of beliefs and arguments crumbled in a few months . 
  from `` the bail-out program is a policy imposed on the greek people by the loan sharks of the eu '' , to `` we signed a harsh deal , but if we had n't things would be unimaginably worse '' . 
  from `` there are no illegal immigrants . 
  everyone is a refugee and we 'll give them the necessary documents to travel to europe '' to people being buried under the snow in tents , or sleeping in the mud , because as a state you ca n't cope with that many people . 
  from the left traditionally being targeted and the newspapers of the left or even center being for many years almost out of law , to a government of the left targeting journalists , media and newspapers . 
  the past 2 years for this government have been damage control . 
  their whole history has collided with reality . 
  each and every one 's in the cabinet history . 
  in the previous weeks he has made claims that `` the borders of our heart reach from thessaloniki ( the birthplace of kemal ataturk ) to mossul '', 
  some rough translation added, 
  [ this ] ( http://www.novinite.com/articles/177589/erdogan%3a+turkey+will+dispute+all+stipulations+of+lausanne+treaty ) is another post about the matter which is now trending in greece . 
  at some point during his speech president erdogan said `` of course we appreciate all the successful stipulations of the lausanne treaty . 
  however it is not an indisputable , sacred text . 
  moving towards 2023 , we are aware that we will touch on many people 's interests . 
  still we will pursue that goal '', 
  i like it . 
  it gives me the vibe of europe 's leader . 
  that if there was someone ( a foreign leader ) who wanted to `` talk business '' with the eu , this is the man to talk to . 
  even though i do n't know any french and i do n't have any connection to france ( other than respect for their history , culture and gastronomy ) , i feel that this man represents me , my rights and my hopes as a european citizen . 
  and that something very powerful imo, 
  here is the view under the acropolis these days https://youtu.be/oaostrpg-zm?t=3m, 
  from the following answer he gave to the journalist ( which i did n't include ) i understood that he meant to talk it out basically . 
  the greek minister of education commented today during an interview :  `` these problems are solved from within . 
  meaning , a strong student 's movement able to protect the premises . 
  also , the academic and administration staff . 
  in that case we know that such phenomena do n't occur . 
  if some `` well-wishers '' want to present these incidents as if they were the norm then ... [ indiscernible ] '', 
  imagine however , that you had a common database for all agencies , that included the same information for every agency and branch of government . 
  then two people would have at least one difference , that being their social security number , or their id number , or their tax id number ( see , that 's three ! ) . 
  how far are we from that technology ? 
  will quantum computing enable such wonders ? 
  i disagree with the term `` debt crisis '' . 
  greece had a `` deficit crisis '' imo . 
  greece had of the highest , if not the highest ( relatively to its population ) public sector expenditure in eu , or even in the whole western world . 
  those structural problems have n't been fixed . 
  as for `` taking the hit '' , i would suggest implementing something similar to that in your personal life . 
  say , get by with a 10th or a 5th of your income .
