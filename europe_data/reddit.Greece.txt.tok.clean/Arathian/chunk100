   the bible and thora have some ridiculous things as well . 
  well , yes , they are * religions * . 
   what about he snake beeing the devil ? 
  a talking bush ? 
  these are normal religious parts and not what people refer to as the `` crazy '' parts . 
  `` crazy '' in this case means `` overly prohibitionist or flat out funny/racist '' . 
  christianity has lots of whacky beliefs but none of those that you mentioned . 
   and anti semtism ? 
  do n't get me started about who killed the christ i mean , jews did kill christ . 
  that 's , uh , kinda objectively true . 
  they saw him as a heretic and a threat and he probably existed historically so yeah . 
  i mean , he was a heretic and a threat and also probably was n't divine in any way , but his cult became successful so he won the propaganda roulette . 
  they would execute people like him regularly . 
  they want to * convince * others . 
  it 's a very important distinction to forcing others . 
  i do n't oppose religions having political involvement . 
  they are organizations like any else so that 's natural . 
  the western ones do n't try to dominate discussion by banning opposing views though . 
  not really . 
  you think the average christian in , say , holland or denmark would support a theocratic state ? 
  nor are all religions explicitly trying to get power . 
  ok , most abrahamic faiths do , but these are n't the only religions, 
  lots of religions are n't theocratic . 
  aka , they do n't seek to meddle with a state 's afairs . 
  most of western christian sects belong to that category .

  `` someone you dislike wants you to do it '' is n't really an argument . 
  yeah , isis would want that probably ( because they are insane ) but that does n't discredit the position . 
  hitler wanted nationalized healthcare . 
  is that an argument against nationalized healthcare ? 
  i am happy you enjoyed it  come again !, 
  ^ ^ please ^ ^ ^ ^ we ^ ^ ^ ^ need ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ money ^ ^ ^ ^ :p, 
  the problem ( in your case ) is that the right 's position of restricted immigration becomes more * justified * with each attack . 
  the attacks are n't just a psychological blow . 
  each validates the right 's concerns . 
  people are attracted to the right because the right is proven correct in its assumptions , not through some mystical force . 
  he was italian/albanian catholic . 
  i assume he is talking about skanderbeg . 
  [ that 's generally a bad thing , a really bad thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war )  the soviets possessed more than three times as many soldiers as the finns , thirty times as many aircraft , and a hundred times as many tanks . 
  the red army , however , had been crippled by soviet leader joseph stalin 's great purge of 1937 . 
  with more than 30,000 of its officers executed or imprisoned , including most of those of the highest ranks , the red army in 1939 had many inexperienced senior and mid-level officers . 
  because of these factors , and high morale in the finnish forces , finland repelled soviet attacks for several months , much longer than the soviets expected . 
  i am trying to figure out whether i should be offended by this or say thanks . 
  we need to deliberate upon this fellow greeks . 
  let 's meet over in the agora after the midday sleep . 
  it is a bit lazy , but it comes with the volume requirements . 
  i do n't have 10 hours a day to mod . 
  i got 1 hour tops . 
  in that hour , i got ta clear 30 threads and 80 comments . 
  if you believe a story should 've stayed , you are always welcome to message us ( or reply to the removal message ) .

  not really . 
  sometimes rules need adjustment depending on various factors .
