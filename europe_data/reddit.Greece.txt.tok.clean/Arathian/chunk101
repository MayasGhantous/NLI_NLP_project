  i mean , i wo n't lie and say i read in detail every article i remove . 
  if it is controversial , i read it ( as in , if i am not sure if it should be removed or not ) . 
  but in this case , i did actually browse the article because it was interesting . 
  not that . 
  i just did n't think it was a big enough story . 
  previous headline was  poland arrests iraqi man for traces of explosives which did n't have things about the parade , just mentioned traces etc for all i knew , it was just a random gun smuggler , and it was also barely reported at the time . 
  i think my removal then was the correct action . 
   they remove stuff from there as well we changed the rules and now / r/europemeta is much freer when it comes to what you can post . 
  i removed it . 
  the previous headline was `` small amount of explosives on iraqi man '' which sounded a lot like local news . 
  seems like it was a bigger story than it seemed . 
  this one gets to stay . 
  nothing nefarious really .

   user reports :  1 : swedish flair never disappoints heh, 
   user reports :  1 : yes i stole 3 cultures today , they were delicious kek . 
  anyway , your comment stays as it is n't rule breaking but do n't be inflammatory in the future . 
  your country wo n't exist without defence though . 
  like it or not , military is central to securing the freedoms you want . 
  the attitude described above is utterly disgusting . 
  it wildly depends really . 
  if i had to guess an average , it would be high 1000 's or early 2000 's . 
  pah , details i say !, 
  so , turks in constantinople , i have a wonderful offer : do you hate erdogan ? 
  do you still like mediterrenean places ? 
  do you want to go to a country with 4 times your average wage ? 
  petition to join greece !, 
  i believe the eu to be a failed project . 
  a use would be a disaster as a result .

  we read every feedback there . 
  meta posts here are not allowed . 
  also , no offence , but it 's not just the 2 rocks and the drilling rights . 
  turkey has tried to pull a lot of shit in the aegean even past that , including claiming a massive part for `` millitary exercises '' in the middle of summer [ a few times ] ( http://www.tovima.gr/en/article/?aid=799737 ), 
  yeah , french cm and british cm differed in height , so the brits used their cms to paint napoleon as shorter ( since french cm were bigger ), 
  circlejerky and not enough mods online to mod it . 
  nope .

  i have unlocked the thread . 
  i will also be watching this thread as a hawk . 
  please refrain from racism and various - isms , criticism of religion is fine , `` sandmonkeys '' is not . 
  ... what ? 
  turkey and armenia are not even close to the same country .

  no personal attacks, 
   `` preventing someone from entering the country '' is a completely nonsensical proposal and does n't even address the issue . 
  the thing that many people say is that none of them ( or their families and parents ) should have come in the first place . 
  not just a year ago when the immigration wave happened , but also 30 and 40 years ago when the first waves from n. africa and the middle east came . 
  i mean , i do n't think we need to pretend like these people have european ancestry . 
  they came to europe . 
  maybe not last year or the year before , but less than 40 years ago . 
  immigration is directly related to the problem and , yes , today 's immigration will cause the same issues 30 years down the line . 
  it is a well known fact that the immigrant 's children are the ones who tend to the get radicalized , not the immigrants themselves . 
  my condolences to france . 
  fuck these terrorist cunts .
