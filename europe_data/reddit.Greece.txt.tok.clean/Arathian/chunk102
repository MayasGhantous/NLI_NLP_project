  okey , this is an official warning : someone went through your history ( stalked really ) and reported like 20-25 + comments where you ask that someone should bomb you/bomb romania . 
  so part a : cut that . 
  you have been tagged , next time , it will result in a ban . 
  it 's creepy , it 's weird and it does n't belong in / r/europe . 
  part b : someone is stalking you . 
  no idea who as reports are anonymous . 
  as a reminder folks : americans are still an ethnicity and biggotry against them is still bannable .

  from the fact that their genes are definitionally human . 
  the method of their creation is n't very relevant to that . 
  vat mice created in tubes are still mice because they share their dna with other mice . 
  if , say , a human was implanted with an ape embryo ( it 's possible , actually ) that embryo would not be human because it does n't have human dna/genes . 
  i think you misunderstood what i said . 
  i reject the definition of fetuses as human when they start to vaguely resemble humans ( aka 3-4 months ) and , instead , consider all human fetuses from conception as human , regardless of how they look .

  i am an atheist . 
  i do n't consider anything `` holy '' . 
  instead , i base my values on human rights , since i believe it 's the best system we have come up until now . 
  when it comes to that , then , i see taking away a life without cause as an affront to rights all humans have or should have . 
  mmmm , i removed the article based on the unreliability tag ( in case it is n't obvious , we ca n't keep track of all the different sources that exist without some sorting method ! ) . 
  i 'll approve it but please make a seperate post linking to the original data . 
  thanks !, 
  you can post that , but the actual link you gave is to an unreliable site , so it 's possible it has various spins on it . 
  well , that 's nice and all , but as far as i am concerned , fetuses are human and have a right to life like all other humans . 
  i see abortions as arbitrary murder and the right to life trumps the right of choice . 
  i also think the state should seriously improve its adoption programs , have a sex-positive education about the risks , offer free protection and birth control etc but if it happens , i am against abortion , full stop . 
  being raped also does n't stop that as the fetus is n't responsible for the horrific actions of his or her biological father .

  a fetus never has emotions , ca n't feel pain etc these are all things that happen near or at birth . 
  until then , the embryo is gestating . 
  right now we use the `` well , it looks kinda human so it must be human '' criteria which is , obviously , not scientific . 
  ( it 's also partially why i am against abortion , considering how arbitrary we define ` human now ' and ` not human now ' in embryos ),

  personal attacks , regardless of whether someone is outrageous or not , is not allowed because it degenerates the discussion in the subreddit . 
  i understand being frustrated but try to not do it next time !, 
  generally , we only allow articles whose main focus is europe rather than ones that also * include * europe ( an important distinction ) . 
  i think it 's fair to state that this article only includes europe , rather than focuses on it so i do n't think my removal is mistaken .

  no personal attacks, 
  berlin is not a typical case though , even for germany . 
  in most countries `` european patriotism '' does n't exist almost at all outside of a few elite circles .
