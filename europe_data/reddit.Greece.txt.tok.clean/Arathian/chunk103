  cool it off mate . 
  add to that the delicious anger from a certain country when he was revealed to be the leader of greece and i am ok with it . 
  still , i would have like a bit of recognition for modern greece . 
  kolokotronis would be an amazing choice !, 
  heck , maybe even kapodistrias . 
  he was n't that bad of a conqueror all things considered . 
  the biggest thing with napoleon was that he * really really * liked war , which kinda lead to the death of millions . 
  but when they conquered something , they typically did n't burn it to the ground . 
  no , that would be a major new development . 
  if there are any major new developments , find an article that reports on it , drop us a quick modmail and we will allow it . 
  for this case , we had 2 large , front page threads . 
  this has no new information so we have no reason to allow it . 
  simple as that . 
  we removed a good 90 % of the brexit articles though . 
  we only allowed interesting ones , high quality ones or new information . 
  heck , we were accused of censorship then for funnelling most stuff to the megathread . 
  it 's a duplicate of an almost 700 comment thread ? 
  it 's honestly our simplest rule : no dups . 
  well , i will be rooting for the angry viking men myself , but best of luck !, 
  angry viking people . 
  they are coming for ya tonight . 
  obvious subject for today will be brexit . 
  with this line-up , it will be * highly * entertaining as they are all high ranking politicians and political figures . 
  i am taking bets on whether there will be physical confrontations or not . 
  edit : by the way , stream starts in 6:30 uk time , aka , 9 mins as of this post . 
  where is my freedom of memes ** nazi mods ??? 
  voters have a right to make mistakes . 
  i raged and begged people to vote `` yes '' in the greek referendum , but we did n't . 
  when the `` no '' result was ignored , however , was an even bigger slap in the face . 
  i ca n't for the life of me figure out when the idea of bureaucratic dictatorship became popular . 
  like , yeah , now they might do whatever that you agree with . 
  what happens tomorrow when the same undemocratic system fucks you over royally like they did to my country ? 
  democracy is here to keep the people in power in check . 
  it 's not perfect but i will take it any day over the shitshow the eu is .

  ach , now i finally believe you are a finn lol . 
  poor guys , you joined in the most fun times . 
  damn nazi mods removing my memes :\\ ^ ) although , seriously now folks , this is not the time . 
  this is n't the place to shitpost . 
  i personally use britpol for such a thing . 
  you forgot to change the first `` will '' to `` vill '' . 
  aye , i agree . 
  i had personally predicted a 52/48 but remain winning . 
  bremain would need more than 100 % of the current votes to win . 
  meaning if every single one of the current ballots is for remain , brexit would still win . 
  it 's why we called it now .

  mass shootings , articles about other places etc yeah , it 's super major . 
  we aknowledge that . 
  we have 2 seperate megathreads on the subject and , by tomorrow , we will be allowing analysis . 
  but having the nth `` goodbye britain '' or `` x news station announces brexit '' thread is useless . 
  yeah , we put it like that . 
  it 's pretty cute in my opinion :3, 
  please use the megathread, 
  we got megathreads . 
  we ca n't have all the front page be about a single subject when we got 2 megathreads . 
  we had the live thread before , which we removed all posts to redirect to . 
  now that brexit 's official , we also stickied another one . 
  come on man , please be realistic . 
  we ca n't have 50 threads on the same topic . 
  52 % as of now . 
  there are 2 stickied on top as of now . 
  please keep in mind this thread is moderated . 
  memes , racism , shitposting etc will be especially harshly punished today . 
  thank you .
