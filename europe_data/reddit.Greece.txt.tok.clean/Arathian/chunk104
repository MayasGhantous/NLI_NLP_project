  sorry , when we sign up as mods , we take an eternal allegiance to la francophone conspiration . 
  i should have clarified that :p, 
  uhuh , so that 's why you fly over mykonos !, 
  both stop music and disrupt the gays , 
  sure . 
  but that is n't what i dispute . 
  / u/gocseji seems to imply he was a terrible leader which is flat out not true for the circumnstances he was elected in . 
  sure , he was n't a leader for peace , but ww2 was anything but peaceful . 
  yeah , an arrogant cunt who gave hitler the middle finger and successfully lead britain through its darkest hour . 
  at some point , you earn the right to be arrogant , if not a cunt . 
  sure , but i still got ta remove personal attacks . 
  i just gave a friendly warning which , i feel , is a reasonable psa . 
  you did n't get tagged or anything long-term for that . 
  we keep stickies for very important things . 
  this is more of a psa ,

  an additional discussion on the incident can be found [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4oo71z/radiohead_fans_beaten_up_in_turkey_for_alcohol/ ) from yesterday . 
  we are currently letting this thread stay up due to its high quality source and additional information . 
  cheers . 
  kek , is he really ? 
  his mother is a greek jew so i assumed he was from thessaloniki . 
  i ca n't they have my karma hostage !, 
  yeah , we ca n't see shit basically . 
  and the #europe is a pretty fun place . 
  talk shit kinda thingy where many mods and regulars hang out . 
  there was a bigger ( 300 + comments ) thread of this that was left up a few hours . 
  head mods said remove it , so we did . 
  this is a duplicate . 
  as far as i can tell , that is n't true . 
  i am ! op in the #europe channel and can see no such thing . 
  maybe the irc owner ( of snoonet ) can , but in the end , your ip is also shown to reddit ** admins ** ( not us mods ) , so i do n't see the big difference . 
  it * is * a good idea . 
  i personally use orangechat in / r/drama . 
  it basically opens a small window on the bottom right of your screen with the irc you can chat at . 
  it also does n't require registration which is a pain and , if you want anonymity for whatever reason , you make a throwaway account just for that or use the normal irc ( which is combined with orangechat ) . 
  seriously , do n't listen to this bitching . 
  i swear , we could announce we are giving free money tomorrow and someone will inevitably bitch at how this is an evil scheme to find everyone 's ip address like we give a fuck what is the ip of an anonymous 10 day old reddit account . 
  caution is fine , this is just stupid . 
  we also get your firstborn and force you to make a pact with satan . 
  jesus christ , how the fuck do ya 'll even come up with this shit . 
  of course we do n't get your ip , much like we do n't see your ip when you post in / r/europe . 
  we do n't own orangechat . 
  it 's just an irc with reddit integration . 
  if you want , use it , if not , do n't . 
  this bitching 's fucking retarded . 
  do n't trust the swedes folks . 
  they lure you into ircs and next thing you know , yer a mod . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ send ^ ^ ^ ^ help, 
  i agree with your point but no personal attacks please . 
  your comment has been removed for that . 
  only chams , not all albanians . 
  most albanians in n. greece were n't even chams . 
  only the muslims were chams . 
  so they were way less than 80.000 anyway , all the sources i could find say that the vast majority actively collaborated . 
  both greek and albanian sources state that . 
  at the time , the albanisn ssr had just been established so they were entering their `` gulags '' phase . 
  the chams got especially fucked from that . 
  children and women are an easy start . 
  those who joined greek forces too . 
  those that did n't join in the paramilitaries supporting the nazis too . 
  after the events , in absentia , they were 2000 more convictions for collaborating with the nazis . 
  as far as i am concerned , there should have been 2000 more executions than there were . 
  both us and canada have a long history of integrating minorities . 
  there was one massacre of about 600 in a village that had fully sided with nazis . 
  was that right even then ? 
  the answer is : no it fucking was n't . 
  mass murder of innocents is always wrong . 
  but the majority of those killed were not that . 
  they were war criminals and nazis . 
  and i will not apologize for executing members of paramilitaries that carried out massacres and war crimes on greek villages . 
   they allied with the nazis because of athen 's disgusting policy towards them , so how can they be traitors to their enemy ? 
  they were opposed to the settlement of greeks from asia minor . 
  was there also discrimination ? 
  most probably . 
  does that excuse nazi collaboration and attrocities commited on civilians ? 
  no it does n't . 
  another sect of albanians , arvanites , did n't collaborate . 
  they were never persecuted , never expelled and today they are part of greece . 
  how did that happen if the fault lies solely on the greek state 's shoulder ? 
  yeah , nice false analogy . 
  read up the wikipedia article before spewing this crap . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/expulsion_of_cham_albanians we killed , at most , about 2.000 , most of which were actual war criminals . 
  the rest were send to albania which executed/exiled a large number .
