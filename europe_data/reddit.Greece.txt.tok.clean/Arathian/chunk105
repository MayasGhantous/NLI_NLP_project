  on the other hand , turkey was the one who genocided 1.5 million armenians and no one else . 
  except , you know , we did n't kill them outside of execution of ** war criminals ** . 
  the albanian state did . 
  are we genociders because the albanian ssr took a look at nazi collaborators and did n't like what they saw ? 
  aromanian were never forbidden . 
  they just were not officially taught ... and why would they be ? 
  greece is , as the name might imply , the land of the greeks where the official language is greek . 
  if you are not greek and live here , great , but expecting the greek state to cater to you is absurd . 
  nor did modern greece ever have an empire with multiple peoples under it which would make enfranchisement a reasonable expectation . 
  we were , and are , definitionally a nation-state . 
  there is nobody forbidding aromanian . 
  we do n't support it within our system , sure , but active persecution never happened . 
  aromanian died because aromanian communities ( along with everyone else ) moved to large city centres ( athens/thessalonika ) where preserving their culture was not really possible . 
  up to 60-70 years ago , aromanian were common . 
  as for this case , read the wikipedia article https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/expulsion_of_cham_albanians chams were active nazi collaborators . 
  and even then , we only killed a small number with most being killed by the albanian state ( because they were nazis ) . 
  yep !, 
  these are/were the arvanites and , today , they are basically indistinguishable from greeks . 
  they are seen as fully greek , many of arvanite ancestry are political leaders etc the chams were a different story . 
  they were nazi collaborators , murderers and traitors . 
  expulsion was being nice to them . 
  no seriously , what ? 
  bulgarians maybe have a case , but albanians ? 
  arvanites were never killed , they got integrated . 
  if that is genocide , the us is the most murderous state on earth , followed by canada . 
  edit : apparently it referred to [ this ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/expulsion_of_cham_albanians ) some notes : 100k is an impossible number as , in total , they were about 50.000 they were expelled because they were , en mass , nazi collaborators . 
  while some were killed by edes ( right wing paramilitary that operated mostly in epirus . 
  my grandpa was part of em ) , the majority killed were actually by the albanian state which tried a lot of them and promptly executed them . 
  tl ; dr : they were nazi collaborators and , even then , it was n't us doing the killing mostly .

  hello and thank you deeply for doing this ama . 
  the green party has the officially policy of condemning nuclear energy . 
  many , including myself , consider that misinformed . 
  while green energy production is obviously preferred , we are far away from the point where we would be sufficient with green energy alone . 
  currently , we mainly use fossil fuels . 
  these tend to be more dangerous and more radioactive than nuclear factories . 
  while we obviously aim for the optimum , why the hard-line stance against nuclear energy , even as a stepping stone ? 
  like , not being racist is fine and all , but what the fuck 's that has be to do with his memory ? 
   white trash that is a racial slur . 
  please do n't use it in the future . 
  your comment was removed . 
  i did n't warn you because you are a turk , i warned you for this part . 
   afaik there are orders to deport and they have disregarded deaths but never have i seen any order to kill them during deportation . 
  if ignoring and disregarding reports is committing genocide i am pretty sure many of the famines in the world were preventable , thus genocides . 
  this is both false and against the officially accepted historical narrative . 
  it constitutes an attempt at minimizing the armenian genocide and thus the warning . 
  i wo n't get on a long debate about this , nor can i right now . 
  just do n't do it again . 
  i am just stating that saying `` merkel is someone to disassociate with '' is kind of absurd . 
  lol , yes you fucking can . 
  merkel is a perfectly reasonable politician . 
  i strongly disagree with her immigration policies and some of her handling of the greek crisis but to pretend like she is the unreasonable one is bloody daft . 
  genocide denial , including the armenian genocide , is a bannable offence . 
  we have a 0 tolerance policy on it . 
  this is your one and only warning . 
  i do . 
  / u/executivemonkey is a shitposter extraordinaire . 
  nope , he is not a filthy power hungry * belgian * !, 
  thrace is in europe last time i checked . 
  turkey has about as many people in europe as my country , greece does . 
  it also used to be much larger inside europe . 
  even in the 16th century onwards , europeans signed treaties to recognize the ottomans as a european empire . 
  thus in general we treat turkey as an european country . 
  like with russia though , localized news that are outside of europe are removed . 
  local conflict in the turkish-syrian conflict or something happening in vladivostok . 
  i have never done that in any serious context and i quite like turks . 
  do n't spread lies . 
  but you will get a ton of exposure !, 
  do n't you like exposure ? 
  jokes aside , it 's not for everyone , i agree . 
  we wo n't treat new mods as third tier mods , they will be normal mods , they will just ( probably ) not be permanent . 
  he did whatever the fuck he wanted , he modded with an agenda and he did n't even try to hide it . 
  not being his brand of `` progressivism '' was `` problematic '' . 
  he was a terrible team player and god help us that he still has his fingers in so many subs . 
  eh , karma is not necessarily a good indicator . 
  a couple of funny shitposts could net you that . 
  and how do we do that in reddit ? 
  make a thread and delete all non-viable users ? 
  how do we approve people who want to be mods etc not to mention seeing how long someone is subbed is not actually possible ( as far as i know ) . 
  as far as i know we allow hurriyet ? 
  why ? 
  i agree with your general sentiment .
