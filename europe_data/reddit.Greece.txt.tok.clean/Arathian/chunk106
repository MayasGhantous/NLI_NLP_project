  the problems are mostly things you ca n't understand without being a mod . 
  logs are only a very small part of the picture . 
  we have several chats and discussions about decisions that you ca n't possibly make public because it would make any modding unworkable . 
  without the proper context , you would see mods overturning others suddenly , bans and then unbans etc. 
  it would be rather confusing . 
  i am not saying that these make public logs a net negative ( i already stated i agree in principle ) , just saying it is slightly more complicated . 
  yeah . 
  dr666 was just a bastard . 
  theskynet i had no clue what was up with until i became a mod and read the backlogs . 
  i felt honestly bad for the guy but him leaving was unquestionably a good thing . 
  if it was solely up to me it would be . 
  my mod actions are 90 % or so approve post anyway . 
  but there are many legitimate ways for not making it public , keep in mind . 
  at the very least , many people reasonably are not comfortable with having their every action over scrutinized . 
  say / r/europe is a country with electronic voting . 
  in real life , every voter would have to use a unique identifier to prove he is a citizen . 
  his ssn , id or whatever . 
  that way it can be assured that the process is properly done . 
  now imagine if there was no such thing and anyone , from anywhere in the world , could vote in those elections without being a citizen and could even do it multiple times by a simple use of vpn . 
  those elections would be an unmitigated disaster . 
  i would love a democratic system in / r/europe but we simply do n't have anything resembling an ssn . 
  we could maybe make a list of approved posters but then we fall into the same trap . 
  if it was an `` everyone votes '' , every extremist with an axe to grind eould make multiple accounts and rig any vote . 
  i understand but please try to avoid that .

  i have actually kept my tags from then so i know exactly what the bans were for . 
  got banned twice for being against the megathreads but both were overturned eventually . 
  even have a tag `` okey guys , ban him for real next time '' :p i did get 1 proper ban in / r/europemeta at some point before i became a mod though . 
  i did actually fuck up there and personally attacked someone .

  warned before too and this is the 2nd instance . 
  wo n't get a ban because both were posted before the ban but for the future : memes and reactions images are not acceptable in / r/europe . 
  hi , thank you for your contribution , but this submission has been removed because it is not on-topic for this subreddit .

  this is n't as a mod but a personal opinion : europe is having a tough cultural war since the 2008 crisis and many people view other viewpoints as `` the enemy '' . 
  / r/europe before was a very small subreddit you had to subscribe to . 
  now it 's a default . 
  that means that many people who do n't understand this subreddit come expecting different things than what the subreddit actually is and wants to be . 
  i believe a lot of the friction comes from that . 
  maybe removing the default status could improve that . 
  i honestly do n't know . 
  i do n't think this subreddit is in a bad place now . 
  censorship is not commonplace , and certainly not what it was a year ago with people like davidreiss and the megasujets but we also have n't let it devolve into memes and inane slapfights . 
  we could of course always improve but hey , baby steps y' know . 
  eh , that 's more of a catchphrase :p it 's a play on an eu saying , do n't take that too seriously . 
  there are like 100 european subreddits and we link to many of them . 
  that 's an excellent suggestion , thank you . 
  elected mods is not a good idea : / if there was a way inside reddit to have `` veteran users '' , maybe then it would be good . 
  but the moment we have a vote right now , it would be a battleground of ideologues and any middle ground would be immediately lost . 
  we would probably end up with a mod who thinks hitler did nothing wrong and another who thinks that castrating all white men would improve society . 
  no , he was n't . 
  wo n't comment further on that user , but he has a long , long history of borderline posts and several bans before this one . 
  i just noticed who he was . 
  there are a few stuff ( like usernotes ) ya 'll ca n't see and sometimes an action might seem overbearing but it 's following a pattern of warnings and previous infractions . 
  we do . 
  in the end , the subreddit is defined by who own it . 
  / r/aww could turn into an anime sub tomorrow if the mods wanted to . 
  we want / r/europe to be for nuanced discussion , not `` reactions to clickbait relating to europe '' . 
  hum , had n't noticed the . co.uk one . 
  in any case , see the edit . 
  pretty much what happened was `` hey guys , there is this story but right now all we have is yahoo news and other shit sources '' `` yeah , remove it for unreliable source/local news until a big news org picks it up '' `` k '' a few removed threads and hours later `` ok , i noticed the independent posted it and it 's in the worldnews sub . 
  i think that 's good enough , right ? '', 
  `` yeah , release the craken '' it 's not really much more complicated than that . 
  we live in 10 different time zones and are not always online all the time . 
  confusion happens . 
  we are kinda low in manpower : / modmail sometimes runs by without us noticing . 
  we get a lot of messages a day . 
  hey , speaking of , we could use a swedish speaker . 
  do consider applying for summer internship . 
   mindset of socio-political islamist supremacism , affirming supremacy over non-muslims by raping their women . 
  i mean , come on now , really ? 
  that was borderline for a ban , actually . 
  we allow critique of islam ( and any other religion ) , but `` they like raping women to show their dominance '' is not that . 
  we do n't really allow articles from express . 
  in fact , i am fairly sure they are autoremoved if posted as threads . 
  express is pretty much the definition of a tabloid . 
  as for the link , again , i ca n't judge . 
  the auto-translation is clunky at best . 
  maybe you were right , maybe you were n't . 
  i honestly do n't know . 
  i mean , yesterday me and / u/stopyellingatmeokay had an hour long discussion to figure out what was going on with the other article . 
  yes there have been . 
  i was actually banned multiple times myself during the whole `` megathread '' kerfuffle . 
  the reason i joined is because that is , to a large extend , behind us now and i would like to keep it that way . 
  we will hopefully work with the community rather than one against the other , 
  for the first : no metaposting allowed in / r/europe . 
  it was a meta post ( this thread 's an exception , obviously ) . 
  the whole point of this thread is to allow more loose meta posts in / r/europemeta and remind people that it is a thing , in fact . 
  as for the 2nd ... uh , erdogan making a statements to muslims is absolutely not relevant to / r/europe , i am not sure how that is not off topic ? 
  edit : above posted linked 2 examples but without an . np link , which is n't allowed . 
  here are his two https://np.reddit.com/r/removalbot/comments/4lz96l/0601_0326_gotta_love_the_new_only_54000_allowed/ https://np.reddit.com/r/removalbot/comments/4lyave/0531_2346_turkeys_erdogan_warns_muslims_against/ my response was towards those . 
  tbh , it 's really hard to judge your situation because i ca n't speak swedish and this will take too long to figure out .
