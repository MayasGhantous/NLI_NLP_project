  the fact is , that the uk today might seemingly have the same unemployment but the money spend on maintaining that is minimum and way within healthy meters . 
  if right now the uk went back to 1970 deficits , it could basically start paving the roads with gold bricks . 
  that 's because the uk today has a real , efficient , functioning economy , not socialist artificial bullcrap .

  quite . 
  remember when thatcher completely `` destroyed '' britain by removing subsidies for inefficient , dying industries and instead focusing on developing new industries and that meant britain would never ever see growth again ? 
  pepperidge farm remembers . 
  no personal attacks . 
  report and move on . 
   germany is in weird position where it shits on the rest of europe while sucking middle east dick make your point in a manner without using borderline expressions . 
  you , / u/haayoaie and / u/heiseigo are all officially warned for racism . 
  not banned , but next time you will be . 
  good to see the uk doing so well . 
  if you would hear many on the british left , they pretend like the conservatives have carpet bombed britain and now there are mostly ruins left with the occasional blood-sucking tory out looking for more meatbags . 
  `` your covre is bloon '' actually and you have to imagine it with a stereotypical french accent . 
  the dutch ? 
  humperdinck humper dinck humper dinck heh that 's an actual name, 
  well , i would n't say it is entirely bs . 
  i mean , when savannajeff and me talk about free trade , we basically completely agree with each other . 
  however , when we talk globalism , immigration etc we are on completely on the opposite scales . 
  i think a more proper way to think about it is that left/right economics is only a part of the equation . 
  i just think of a smug nigel farrage after britain leaves the eu to help me sleep at night . 
  so * dreamy * :\\ ^ ), 
  eh , when you take part in a community for a long time , you start to recognize regulars . 
  it 's pretty much unavoidable . 
  plus , as a mod , it 's useful when considering new mod nominations . 
  naurgul was the type of person who was delusional enough to think people disagreeing with him means they are either evil or stupid . 
  there was no talking to him . 
  he would either lecture you until you gave up or go on a crusade against you . 
  you do n't know his infamous posts in / r/greece so i understand it 's kind of harder to understand without the full context . 
  at some point a few months ago , i became his new target because i became a mod and , horror of horrors , i did n't bent over to him . 
  unlike his previous targets , i do n't let asshats roll over me . 
  i got a personal problem with the dude and he has a personal problem with me . 
  i am sure he is in fact reading this and will inevitably pm you a long ass pm with a ton of bullshit . 
  he does that to anyone i talk to . 
  savannajeff and slyratchet ( well , the second obviously with his post here ) both post here though . 
  as for the other one , he tried to doxx me and started a harassment campaign/witch hunt against me . 
  fuck him and good riddance . 
  he is permabanned and will stay that way . 
  edit : to expand a bit further on the first two . 
  i think sly is one of the best posters , fullstop . 
  we literally agree on almost nothing and yet he is one of the most enjoyable people to talk to , especially in the irc . 
  savanajeff i also mostly disagree with but , unlike sly , he is uh ... fairly combative . 
  he is n't a bad poster/person but he does get a toxic on occasion . 
  i do n't think he realizes that himself which is a shame . 
  if he improved on that , he would be a great poster , imo .

  i actually have something to contribute here today !, 
  i recently made for an uh ... special other , the following : ** lobster bisque soup ** i used 3 lobsters ( although that was a lot of soup at the end ) . 
  put about 2 inch of water in a large pot , boil it . 
  put some kosher salt in , put in the lobsters for about 20 minutes ( a good rule of the thumb with lobsters is that they are supposed to turn red when they are properly cooked ) . 
  take out the lobsters , keep the water you boiled them in . 
  take out the lobster 's meat . 
  meanwhile , put in a small pot a good amount of butter ( i put like a third of a bar ) , wait for it to melt then put in onions , carrots , cellery , salt ( a bit ) and kayen pepper ( quite a bit ) . 
  when the stuff are soft and melt-y , take them out and put them in a blender along with about a third of the lobster meat . 
  melt them . 
  i filtered the water you boiled the lobsters in . 
  then , i threw the blended mix in ( yes , seriously , it 's fine ) . 
  then i slowly cooked it for about 20 minutes . 
  i added crushed tomatoes in it ( it 's the uh , pulped tomatoes , not a tomato soup which is different ) until it turns orange . 
  you then also add a good amount of half and half cooking cream milk . 
  cook for another 10 minutes and taste . 
  add salt/kayene pepper as appropriate . 
  steer occasionally . 
  needs about 1h total cooking in low fire . 
  last 10 minutes . 
  you should add white wine . 
  when it 's done , add the rest of the lobster meat inside , and enjoy !, 
  come out looking like [ this ] ( http://cooksandeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/lobster1.jpg ) . 
  it 's a creamy , very lobster tasting soup and it is delicious .
