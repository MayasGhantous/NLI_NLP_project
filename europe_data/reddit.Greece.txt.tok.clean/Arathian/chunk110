  i mean , we could .

  not sure why you are downvoted . 
  you are absolutely correct . 
  the cost of the passport to the average mexican is much higher than that of the average turk even though the turkish passport costs more .

  yes it is !, 
  and they will .

  every sub does that , really . 
  at least the more tightly moderated ones . 
  and i do n't think not allowing discussions about a politician 's statements to devolve into a pissing contest about the mods to be `` authoritarian '' . 
  honestly , / r/europemeta is n't there to silence anything . 
  it 's actually there for feedback/discussion . 
  in regards to that , we are discussing stuff about it right now between us . 
  have ye little faith and all that .

  it was a mistake , it 's removed . 
  edit : actually , i wo n't leave this to the default removal message . 
  i would like to apologize for this staying up . 
  we make a big deal about only allowing good sources and on-topic threads and this stays up for how many hours . 
  that was our fault and we apologize for it . 
  hopefully , it wo n't happen again . 
  no flame baiting and personal attacks . 
  maybe i 'll make one with weeaboos :3, 
  do you happen to have the greek version of that ? 
  i made that one sometime 5-6 years ago and it became pretty popular . 
  was looking for it forever !, 
  it 's just a post about the aurochs  it 's a legit article by cnn !, 
  plus , i am a mod :d,

  i know . 
  you are n't banned , but it * was * getting close , thus the warning . 
  do not incite or promote violence . 
  next offence will result in a ban . 
  no , not even to people you politically disagree with . 
  oh , cool it down . 
  this is getting dangerously close to xenophobia . 
  eh , just because we have a problem with turkey ( the state ) does n't mean we have a problem with turks ( the people ) . 
  actually , i quite love the turks . 
  ironically , they are one of the closest ( culturally ) peoples to greece . 
  maybe if our history was n't so bad , we would n't be such strong enemies . 
  i am having kinda of a sore throat tbqh , a war in the seas would do me no good at that stage . 
  i say let 's wait up for me to feel better and we 'll schedule our lil ' kerfuffle . 
  sometime latter this week , yes ? 
  bigly so,
