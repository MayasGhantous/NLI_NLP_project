  this is a warning for personal attacks . 
  edit your pa out of your comment for it to be re-approved . 
   now it is time for european solidarity . 
  sure , and we would love that , but we stopped expecting that a few years ago . 
  it 's why i went from a soft european federalists to anti-eu myself . 
   even as a dane i really enjoy lamb , sorry . 
  you do understand this is a violation of a very real international treaty , right ? 
  seize to break international law immediately !, 
  he is a good pupper and had a good pupper walk :3 http://i.imgur.com/x3czghu.jpg here is a pic of him from the summer, 
  was n't me in the queue, 
  yeah , we use keywords . 
  no , we ca n't say what those keywords are . 
   i find your being tired to be pretty selective . 
  look , no offence , but i worked 12 hours today . 
  i am pretty damn tired and i still have n't walked the dog for the night . 
  i am a volunteer , ca n't be all day up for reddit : / i hope you understand that . 
  we ca n't shadowban people , that 's admin-only , we are mods . 
  we can only botban people , which we used to use only for new accounts ( at least since i became a mod ) who clearly broke the rules . 
  for some time now , we changed it so no one gets botbanned . 
  if you were ever banned , you would get a notification for it . 
  your posts are simply in the modqueue that i am too tired to clear up right now . 
  edit : plus , we would n't ever ban someone for something so petty . 
  i mean , you were being a dick , but not a permaban dick . 
  yes , this is pleasing, 
  he likes merkel a lot so he will shill for the challenger of merkel ? 
  lolwut dude , at least get your conspiracy theories in order . 
  every time i have to remove a meme i lose a part of my soul because i turn into a no fun allowed person . 
  pls spare the poor soul of your most beloved ( this is fact , right ? ),

  basically , a mod tool addon ( that basically every mod on reddit uses ) allows you to `` tag '' posts . 
  what it means is , we tag rule breaking posts that are n't worthy of bans with that offence so we keep a record . 
  the tag has a small comnent ( eg `` personal attack '' ) and a link to the tagged comment.that 's what i meant . 
  so say , someone who does a personal attack wo n't get banned usually , but if it is his 3rd or 4th , he might . 
  we try to warn users when we tag them with `` you are warned for x rule breaking behaviour '' . 
  internally , we use different tags to differenciate between a tag + warning versus simply tagging it to keep track of whether users know they offended or not . 
  the tags expire after a while so it 's not permanent . 
  no , you ca n't . 
  in general , we would prefer the sub to not be banned/lose its default status over allowing doxx . 
  and also , while these pieces of shit are almost certainly guilty , in most cases it is n't as cut and dry so not telling names before trial is generally a good idea to prevent ruining innocent peoples lives . 
  yeah , pretty much agree personally . 
  it 's why i sometimes read rt myself . 
  we have discussed loosening the ban , but there is no concensus within the team . 
  even then , we will pass it from the users before doing anything . 
  we do n't even consider it in regards to dm . 
  what we have discussed internally was loosening the ban on rt since it 's not outright trash , even if it has bias for a lot of subjects ( which is what brought the ban in the first place ) . 
  we are only talking about that though and we will ask the community before doing anything . 
  well , thankfully , we have people who are glad to translate reliable local sources and we even have a large list of them in a major thread a while back , so the need for a sub-standard source simply is n't there . 
  reason the local is banned is same as with the rest . 
  it had way too many wrong articles . 
  basically , when it was allowed , half the articles posted were as follows : top comment : `` actually , this did n't happen , it was a rumour '' or `` this did n't happen as the article describes it . 
  here is a reliable source explaining '' . 
  next was a long comment chain saying how shit the local is , followed by people duking it out over being sjws/neo-nazis . 
  so that 's why it 's been banned , even before i became a mod nearly a year ago . 
  thank you !, 
  we try to be as objective as possible when possible and make the rules as clear ( it 's why we decided to blanket ban instead of just having it in the `` sometimes removed list '' because it was way too subjective at times , or why we made constant small changes to the local crime rule ) but you are correct in that , in the end , a lot of stuff comes down to subjective judgement .
