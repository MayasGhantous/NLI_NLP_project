  it 's why we strive to have a politically diverse team . 
  currently , we have conservatives , liberals , socialists etc all represented in the mod team in order to have everyone 's perspectives .

  never been a smoker , hate smoking with a passion . 
  buuuut at some point it infringes on freedom , which is a big no-no . 
  yeah , you should n't force others to inhale your smoke by , eg , smoking in public , but banning it outright inside one 's private home or car ? 
  that 's a few steps way too far . 
  the government should have no right to say what you can or ca n't inhale . 
  if you cheer for this but , say , want cannabis legalized you are being a hypocrite . 
  ya 'll forget the flags !, 
  actually , our problem was the sources . 
  initially it was banned sources ( daily mail , rt etc ) which are always removed . 
  our `` controversial '' removal was from the independent , but if you read that article , it was basically `` the local reported this happened '' and , since we ban the local , we believed it wrong to leave that one . 
  essentially , we were removing till a reliable source cropped up . 
  once that happened , musty ( who is a mod ) posted it . 
  do you guys really want us to let shit sources for the sake of having the thread up asap ? 
  our policy is that it 's better to be a few hours late with a good source than right when it happens but a shit source . 
  breaking news , like terrorist attacks , get reported near instantly by good sources anyway . 
  it 's not censorship , at least not intentionally . 
  heck , i wan na discuss this . 
  but we believe quality control is very important . 
  eh , if there are no identifying/doxxing parts ( like names etc ) , i think it 's fine . 
  we will certainly not ban/tag you for it , worst case another mod will remove the post .

  not the one downvoting mate . 
  sorry ` bout that . 
   we ca n't even negotiate until we 've actually left the eu . 
  even then , fta 's take so long to negotiate there 's a good chance he wo n't even be president by the time it 's done . 
  i do n't think it will take that long , but importantly , he really strengthens your negotiating position when he points that , f.ex. , you will be in front of the queue for trade deals . 
  it 's one of the best things that could happen to post-brexit britain imo . 
  we simply do n't see the big harm of it . 
  people want to discuss this stuff and many love this community . 
  big enough , no . 
  if a 9/11 style event happens again , we will also have a sticky for it , for example . 
  this counts . 
  it 's big news , we also had an elections thread . 
  there are people who look at a field and see the cow dung and others who see how many crops could grow there . 
  `` real world '' is overrated . 
  seriously ? 
  was it americans that combed the shit out of libya ? 
  there are few more destabilizing moves that happened . 
  libya was n't just a relatively well off country , libya was also a bottleneck for immigrants from all africa . 
  qaddafi 's security forces stopped millions from coming each year and he specifically told us that . 
  look , i am not going to pretend to be smart , even i ate the propaganda a bit back then and qaddafi did handle the crisis terribly , but we ca n't deny we screwed up as europe . 
  you are officially warned for agenda pushing and hatespeech .

   growth is impossible without consumers and workers without disposable income ca n't consume in the way our society/economies depend on for growth and innovation . 
  actually not really ? 
  growth is impossible without a consumer base , but it does n't have to be in the same country . 
  international trade is a thing . 
  i mean , not many people in china are buying the billions of iphones made , as an easy example . 
   that said , setting a maximum income limit too low would be nearly exactly as misguided and dangerous as stuff like allowing the kind of income disparity we 've seen grow or allowing secondary and tertiary markets like derivatives and whatnot to dwarf the market for primary economic activities . 
  wait , what does the income cap have to do with a consumer base with disposable income ? 
  income caps will actively hurt the average person by slowing down the economy , killing jobs and investment . 
  it will literally make everyone poorer . 
   that seem really good on paper it really does n't . 
  income caps are fucking moronic . 
  it literally disincentives production from the most capable people in the country . 
  i can think of few things that are worse , even on paper . 
  both . 
  the proposal is fundamentally absurd . 
  do not advertise in / r/europe before asking in the modmail . 
  no personal attacks .
