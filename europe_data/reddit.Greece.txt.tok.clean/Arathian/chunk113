  cool it mate . 
  no low effort memes please . 
   no one in their right mind believed that syriza will do the thessaloniki program . 
  ph-leeze , this subreddit had a huge pro-syriza circlejerk 2 years ago . 
  / r/greece was even worse . 
  questioning saint varoufaki was a capital crime . 
   the hard one was to propose a viable alternative to syriza at that period of time . 
  people had to try something else contrary to the years of governance of nd and pasok that brought economic hell to us the younger generation . 
  nd was doing fine . 
  not great , but fine . 
  even with the refusal to implement some necessary liberal reforms , it was nowhere near terrible . 
  the year syriza was elected we would finally have growth , for example . 
  then syriza happened . 
  even the old pasok would have honestly been a better alternative . 
  we fell for populist demagogues . 
  that 's on us . 
  saying `` but there was no alternative ! '', 
  is trying to excuse our own mistakes , which , ironically , is what brought this shitshow on us . 
   sad thing is , people tried and is more of the same . 
  funny part of the story is that now that syriza seems to be doing `` well '' by eu terms ( surplass , growth etc ) people wo n't vote for him and with good reason , same that happened with nd and `` success story '' of late 2014 syriza is failing in the polls because leftists do n't want to do `` good with the eu '' , they want varoufakis back and for the debt to go magically away and right wingers/pro-eu people prefer nd , especially with mitsotakis , who has a far more liberal stance with the economy . 
  also , while the program is working mostly because now we finally have stability , syriza still refuses to let go of its retarded economic ideology and reduce taxation , f.ex . 
  pinging the user makes that a personal attack . 
  man , i can go back to my all time controversial comments and 2/3rds of em are calling out syriza 2 years ago . 
  i would say `` feels good to be proven right '' but ... . not really . 
  i would have preferred to be wrong , but unfortunately , what would happen was kinda obvious .

  do n't editorialize titles op .

  this is an official warning . 
  not if they were `` born-again '' . 
  isis is nothing if not hypocritical .

  do n't be too harsh , he is a german after all : <, 
  well i am not german or in germany  my flair is a common twitch chat joke and fairly popular . 
  it basically implies that `` the mods are nazis '' ( usually spammed when someone got banned ) . 
  it 's a small in joke . 
  if we take nazi symbolism seriously always , it will never lose its power . 
  because they are hilarious . 
  it 's a joke . 
  reeeeee stay away from me you fucking witch, 
  that 's not even the biggest issue . 
  people who call pitogyro `` souvlaki '' need to be burned at the stake for their heresy . 
   why does n't anyone plow through merkel ? 
  we would all be safer then . 
  that was the comment . 
  the full comment . 
  you are probably confusing this with some other comment . 
   / r/europemeta exists purely so people would have somewhere to complain . 
  you are correct . 
  so please utilize an / r/europemeta thread for any further complaints you might have .
