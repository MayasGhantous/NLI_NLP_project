  further infractions will result in a ban . 
  no , `` it was a joke '' is not an excuse . 
  yeah , pretty much like rt. 
  we have found way too many cooked/untrue stories from ut . 
  similarly to rt it 's used as a government mouthpiece , especially when it comes to russo-ukrainian issues,

  conscription does n't protect individuals . 
  that argument 's dumb . 
  conscripts ca n't have the army gun with them . 
  they keep it strictly inside the camp and take it with them only for specific jobs that they have to . 
  conscription is there to supplement the armed forces , fullstop . 
  private guns are extremely safe and , frankly , an obvious right when proper security procedures happen . 
  switzerland has the most guns per capita in the world . 
  by your logic , there should be mass shootings daily instead of being one of the most safe countries in the world .

  it 's not just what you say , it 's how you say it . 
  * with the current program * and the current * government * who is unwilling to make any necessary changes , paying back the debt is impossible . 
  but the debt itself is not inherently unpayable . 
  with a less strict program , focused on growth instead of just austerity and extremely harsh reforms on corrupt segments of the economy ( i am looking at the public sector honestly . 
  i think someone should start going at them with a chainsaw ) the debt is very much payable . 
  our government was combative and basically pissed off the european on purpose for cookie points with the electorate until reality came and bitchslapped them in the face . 
  that is our fault , not the program 's and not the eu 's . 
  i have a ton of problems with the eu ( including with the handling of the crisis ) but we need to look at our own before pointing fingers . 
  no i did n't and it 's not really relevant . 
  random interviews by an entertainer in an edited video are neither reports by a major news outlet nor a highly trustworthy source like a university lecture . 
  his degree is also irrelevant in that respect . 
  if you have any further questions , please use the modmail . 
  one is a professor , the one is an entertainer . 
  there is a quality difference between the two . 
  professors are kinda definitionally experts on their subjects . 
  1 ) university lecture from a large university . 
  falls under reliable/quality source . 
  2 ) not political . 
  slice of life posts have lower standards of acceptance than political posts and even users can post their own stuff . 
  3 ) same as above . 
  not political , lower standard . 
  i should have clarified i meant political posts above . 
  my apologies . 
  in general , we do not allow youtube videos outside of very specific cases ( usually reports from major news outlets ) . 
  the removal is consistent with that policy .

   so you can be `` greek '' only if you have greek roots ? 
  correct . 
  you can be a citizen of greece without greek roots but you are never a greek , because being greek and having greek roots is one and the same . 
   all of cypriots have greek descent?i do n't think so , many could easily fit in the levant . 
  all greek cypriots have greek roots , yes . 
  you do n't have to be 100 % pure ( there is no such thing anyway ) , but basically every single greek cypriot can trace his ancestry to greek families . 
   the point is not descent though , it is where you were born and raised.therefore people who are born and raised in greece and feel greek are greek.people who are born and raised in cyprus and feel cypriot , are cypriots . 
  most cypriots feel greek * and * cypriot because , get that , they are greek * and * cypriot !, 
  much like a cretan can be both greek and a cretan . 
   so south belgians are french and north belgians are dutch?i see . 
  yep , to some extend . 
  they started self-identifying as something else thus creating a different culture but their ethnicity remains french and dutch . 
  much like people from fyrom identify as `` macedonians '' but are ethnically bulgarian . 
  you are literally trying to argue against a definition mate . 
  might as well try to argue against gravity while at it . 
   it 's not a meme , it 's an opinion it 's a wrong opinion . 
  opinions can be wrong . 
  being greek is an * ethnicity * . 
  the definition of ethnicity is `` the fact or state of belonging to a social group that has a common national or cultural tradition . '' . 
  that 's contrasted to countries like america where they do n't have a common ethnicity but rather rely on civic nationalism . 
  greece is an ethnic state of greek people . 
  so with that in mind , people of greek descend who follow common greek social customs are greek . 
  greek cypriots are 100 % greek and any opinion to the contrary is wrong . 
  simple as that , it 's not really debatable . 
  greek does n't mean `` citizen of greece '' . 
  you can be greek while having never been to greece . 
  greek cypriots are ethnically 100 % greek .
