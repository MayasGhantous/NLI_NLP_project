  can we stop this fucking meme about cypriots `` not being greek '' ? 
   tfw 0 answers for favourite mod is me ; ___________ ; you wound me guys, 
  i general disagree with the article , although i find it interesting . 
  one particular part that rubbed me the wrong way :  some argue that the niqab ( as well as less concealing forms of islamic dress ) is a form of oppression . 
  muslim women , they say , are forced to wear the veil by family members -- typically their husbands , fathers or brothers . 
  that may be true in some cases . 
  yet a ban might simply prevent those niqab-wearing women from leaving the house at all this is a completely backwards thinking . 
  we should not treat oppression by appeasing it . 
  we did not stop wife beating by telling the wives to not talk back . 
  we banned it and jailed the people who did it . 
  we should not allow a symbol of oppression so opressive muslim men allow a molecule more freedom to their women . 
  full text : angela merkel , germany 's chancellor , is often seen as the west 's last best defender of the liberal order against a tide of populism . 
  she is likely to win re-election next autumn , but faces a challenge from the anti-immigrant alternative for germany . 
  so mrs merkel needs to buck up her own party , the centre-right christian democratic union , which is disillusioned with the `` welcome culture '' for refugees that she has promoted . 
  speaking to party delegates on december 6th , mrs merkel promised that the events of 2015 , when 890,000 refugees claimed asylum in germany , `` can , shall and must not be repeated '' . 
  she vaunted her government 's european values of sexual equality and religious tolerance . 
  and , in a line that drew long applause , she added that `` the full veil is not appropriate for us , and should be banned wherever legally possible . '' there is a contradiction in mrs merkel 's embrace of liberal values and her vow to ban the full veil , known variously as the niqab or burqa . 
  wearing it is regarded by some muslims as a religious duty for women when in public . 
  a ban infringes the freedom of religion . 
  it is also unenforceable , polarising and serves to pander to populists . 
  like many other rights , religious freedom is not absolute . 
  sometimes the state has good reasons to require people to show their faces : at passport controls , for example , or if they are working as , say , social workers or teachers . 
  for security reasons , germany already bans ski masks and other facial coverings in public demonstrations . 
  yet mrs merkel did not speak in such limited terms . 
  she proposed the ban as a means of preventing the development of `` parallel societies '' as germany tries to assimilate its muslim immigrants . 
  forbidding religious dress worn by only a tiny fraction of those immigrants is the wrong way to accomplish this . 
  some argue that the niqab ( as well as less concealing forms of islamic dress ) is a form of oppression . 
  muslim women , they say , are forced to wear the veil by family members -- typically their husbands , fathers or brothers . 
  that may be true in some cases . 
  yet a ban might simply prevent those niqab-wearing women from leaving the house at all . 
  other women may choose to cover their hair or faces out of piety , or because they dislike being ogled , or to affirm their muslim identity . 
  governments concerned about the subjugation of muslim immigrant women would do better to concentrate on integration and education schemes . 
  europe 's fad for such bans is driven chiefly not by principles , but politics . 
  france introduced a burqa ban in 2010 ; some municipalities even tried to prevent muslim women from wearing the body-covering `` burqini '' at the beach last summer . 
  such measures only invite extremists to paint france as an enemy of islam . 
  last month the netherlands adopted a ban on face-covering garb in education and health-care establishments , government buildings and public transport . 
  in both cases , the real motive was to fend off the rise of anti-immigrant parties , such as marine le pen 's national front in france and geert wilders ' party for freedom in the netherlands . 
  if centrists like mrs merkel now see burqa bans as minor concessions to hold off populists , they are fooling themselves . 
  those who want to ban veils are not worried about security but about immigration and integration . 
  to them , limited bans confirm only that mainstream politicians are too timid to embrace the real thing . 
  some of them worry legitimately that muslim immigrants do not share europe 's liberal norms . 
  but the best way to preserve those freedoms is to let women dress as modestly as they please . 
  it 's `` fascist '' god damnit . 
  why do everyone misspell it as facist lately .

  this is a quality sticky thread folks !, 
  awwww thanks :3, 
  er , unless i am mistaken , the bosnian genocide was directly supported ( and encouraged ) by the serbian government at the time ? 
  although i understand your argument . 
  however , the reason i said `` state organized '' is because loose , decentralized bands with no central direction of any sort simply lack the ability and organization to do anything of the scale that would be considered a genocide . 
  these slaughters were also fairly commonplace at the time . 
  in fact , they happened on a much larger scale right after with the invasion of ali in support of the ottomans . 
  we ca n't really judge by modern standards , that 's a fallacy . 
  ( to be clear though , i obviously condemn any slaughters ), 
  yeah , pretty much . 
  greece and greeks were a bunch of uneducated villagers whose education consisted of having the village priest read them the bible once when they were young . 
  things like human rights and rules of war were n't even heard as a concept there . 
  honestly , calling it 15th century is me being generous . 
  `` enter enemy town , kill everyone '' was how every war was fought in the balkans during the ottoman empire . 
  it was true with the serbs , romanians , turks , bulgars and , of course , us . 
  it was n't , not really . 
  genocide has to be state organized and deliberate on civilian populations . 
  this was mostly 15th century style warfare . 
  enter enemy 's town , kill everyone , take the women . 
  turks did it too , ali did it too when he invaded etc this was different from the deliberate and highly organized massacre of all non-turkish elements throughout the former ottoman empire done by the yurkish state . 
  it was also 100 years latter , which is very important . 
  yeah . 
  it 's tagged reddit wide actually .

  i do n't believe so , no . 
  but even if they were , there are several reasons pasok took the majority of the blame . 
  they were the leading party when the crisis started . 
  pasok was elected with , literally , the slogan `` there are money '' ( implying we had money but nd was trying to cut stuff for selfish purposes ) and then , the moment they got in power , they said `` we bankrupt lul '' , pasok is the most closely associated with the corrupt state for several reasons etc basically , pasok was seen as the main reason behind the current failure of the economy . 
  nd managed to escape the destruction but was still hurt , going from ~ 40 % of the vote down to ~ 20 % ( but still first or second biggest party ), 
  pasok is dead and the name is slightly more toxic than a chemical plant 's raw sewage . 
  maybe we will have early elections . 
  nd , the right wing party , is pushing hard for them .
