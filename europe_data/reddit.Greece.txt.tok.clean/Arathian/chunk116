  he means dardans and illyrians were where fyrom is located today , which is mostly wrong actually . 
  modern fyrom covers paionian lands . 
  tbh , i do n't understand the obsession with alexander when they could easily ( and far more accurately ) claim the legacy of a large tribe of badass thracians who were famous warriors and merceneries . 
  unlike macedonians , they actually are closely related since most of them mixed and became one with bulgarians . 
  oh no , they will trade and become richer , truly it would be better to be poor and miserous so they can stick it to the filthy capitalist pigs . 
  i will never understand you people . 
  i am sure poles are crying their way to the bank , while having better healthcare and rule of law and more opportunities . 
  hellen is literally the greek word for greek . 
  hellens literally means greeks . 
  it 's synonymous . 
  it 's like saying `` they are not germans , they are deutschlanders '', 
  this is an official warning for personal attacks . 
  further personal attacks will result in a ban . 
  pls, 
  they were dead in the water anyway . 
  the coal mines were going to go . 
  only thing thatcher did was get rid of them before they took the rest of the british economy with em . 
  very well, 
  that comment was re-approved by accident . 
  he was n't warned just for this comment , he was warned for his following comments too , which in combination , show he is clearly trolling . 
  i always warn people , check my post history . 
  it 's either that or ban them . 
  the above user generally would have been banned . 
  warnings are there to help you guys , not to threaten you or anything . 
  hi , we generally keep these type of threads in / r/askeurope .

  no need to actually be able to speak it . 
  please provide at least a brief explanation as to why , 
  good evening ladies and gentlemen in the monthly greek elections threads !, 
  last month , we had a nail bitting referendum that was promptly completely ignored !, 
  this month , we have another general election , the 2nd one this year after january 's . 
  with the polls just closing , we can now properly funpost about the elections . 
  the contestants are : syriza : you know them , you hatelove them . 
  leftists . 
  wanted to stop the austerity so they raised a huge ruckus around europe only to vote in the harshest austerity package yet and then dissolve into 3 different parties in true leftist fashion . 
  tsipras is still the head of the party and the party is the current frontrunner . 
  new democracy : right wing conservatives . 
  lead by some old guy who lost his hair 40 years ago . 
  currently 2nd highest polling party . 
  kke : did you ever feel like voting for hardcore stalinists who flat out state they would never accept any sort of power in the electoral system yet run for elections anyway ? 
  well , 5-7 % of the population in greece does !, 
  golden dawn : golden dawn is the zionist party of greece . 
  it aims to bring diversity and tolerance in greece as well as support israel . 
  its platform includes increased immigration , large benefits for asylum seekers and greece to give its islands to israel . 
  currently has 8-10 % of the vote . 
  potami : the river . 
  it is an aquatic party whose official aim is summoning cthulu but does n't believe he is to be found in the deepest seas but somewhere in the haliacmon river . 
  popular unity : a splinter party of syriza . 
  official description reads `` kke 2.0 : updated no policy '' independent greeks : it 's like nd but against the eu ... kinda ? 
  used to be partnered up with syriza , will probably not even enter parliament . 
  so boring , i ca n't even think of a good joke about them . 
  pasok : okey , seriously , who the fuck 's still voting for pasok ? 
  like , do you actually know anyone who voted for pasok the past 4 years ? 
  how the hell as they still in the parliament ? 
  that 's the official descriptions of the party . 
  post away your hopes for the elections , predictions etc edit : by popular demand ( and since they will also probably enter parliament ) i am adding centrist union : centrist union : that 's our worth ... as a people ... monkeys snitches schitzophrenic bribed submissive traitors ... they ask our votes ... and we here ... !!!!!!, 
  giving it to them !!, 
  hey guys , meant to make this thread earlier . 
  in 1.5 hours since this post ( 10 gmt ) , i will host an eu4 campaign and i invite everyone interested to join . 
  i will host . 
  we will be playing for 3 hours , but if you want to leave earlier , you can do that , it 's no problem . 
  from next week , it will be every saturday at 7 gmt for 4 hours . 
  if you are interested , add me on steam ( arathian , country greece , bismarck icon ) and please state in this thread what country you are interested in playing . 
  as a side-note , i got all the dlc so you just need the base game on steam for this to work and you will have access to everything the host ( aka me ) has . 
  cheers !, 
  edit : we wo n't be playing this week , but we will be playing next saturday at 7 gmt for 4 hours . 
  you do n't have to stay for 4 hours , of course , but once we start , we wo n't be stopping for newcomers to join because that would kill the pacing of the game . 
  i will make a thread again next week so do n't worry about forgetting it . 
  just check / r/europe !, 
  hey guys , as per the [ thread last week ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3vkvul/reurope_eu4_campaign/ ) the eu4 campaign is coming soon . 
  in roughly 12 hours from this post , at [ 7 pm gmt ] ( http://time.is/gmt ) we will be starting the eu4 campaign . 
  there are no `` spots '' , you are free to join !, 
  to join , just add me on [ steam . 
  ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198008930489 ) the rules of the campaign are simple : - we will be playing from 7 gmt until 12 gmt , so 5 hours . 
  you do n't have to stay the full 5 hours and can leave any time but we will not be restarting every time someone shows up . 
  we will be starting at 7 and finishing at 12 . 
  - unless everyone agrees to restart , if someone 's internet is dodgy and ca n't handle it , i am sorry , but we wo n't be restarting every 20 minutes because this would kill the game . 
  basically , we will be going slowly and if you still desynch , unfortunate , but we wo n't be stopping . 
  - you can pick any country . 
  yes , including france and the ottomans . 
  do n't complain if people gank up against you though  - there is no forced continuity . 
  you can play any nation you want any session nor you need to join every session .
