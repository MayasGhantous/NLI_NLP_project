  if you want to join this week and skip the next week then play a different nation in 3 weeks , that 's fine . 
  if someone played his nation last week and wants to continue with that nation , he has priority . 
  that 's it folks . 
  see you in 12 hours !, 
  i will go to sleep now so i wo n't be adding people immediately to steam but i will do it a bit before the game . 
  please upvote ( self-post so i do n't get karma ) for visibility of other players that want to join . 
  cheers !, 
  edit : game invites start now !, 
  edit2 : game started !, 
  edit3 : game is now over . 
  thank you everyone that came , that was great fun and i managed to pu aragon just in time before the session ended !, 
  we meet again next week , same time as now . 
  7 pm gmt . 
  i will make a new thread then , 
  hey again folks , on 19th of december , at [ 7 pm gmt ] ( http://time.is/gmt ) we continue our eu4 campaign from last week . 
  the game , like last time , will last 5 hours but you can drop off at any time before that . 
  no hard feelings !, 
  ** to join : ** [ add me on steam ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198008930489 ) i will accept your invitation tomorrow and will invite you to the game a few minutes before we start . 
  faq : - i did n't join last week , can i join now ? 
  answer : absolutely !, 
  you can also pick any nation unless someone played it previously , in which case , that someone has priority . 
  but if he is n't there when we play , you can take it . 
  - i can only join for 3 hours , not 5 , is that fine ? 
  answer : then join for 3 hours and leave before 5 . 
  that 's fine  - i came 10 minutes late and you have already started / i crashed / i got annexed and disconnected , what do ? 
  answer : we will be playing with a ton of people . 
  last week , we had a good 20-25 people joining the game . 
  that means we ca n't be restarting every time someone joins or disconnects . 
  we will be having 3 restarts total for everyone that came late or crashed to be able to rejoin . 
  - my internet is trash , can i join anyway ? 
  answer : sure but ... your internet probably ca n't handle it . 
  if you go out of synch , we wo n't be restarting just for you . 
  it 's just impractical , sorry !, 
  - any other rules ? 
  answer : no rules . 
  feel free to do anything the game allows . 
  that includes annexing other players , betraying and the rest . 
  please do n't be a dick about things though . 
  do n't keep someone occupied for a decade just to spite them and do n't refuse to accept a peace deal even if you are completely occupied . 
  basically , do n't be unessarily a dick when it comes to game mechanics . 
  have fun !, 
  edit : i was 20 minutes late , i am starting the invites now !, 
  edit2 : we have started about 20 minutes now . 
  25 of us !, 
  good luck to all participants  edit3 : ggwp everyone !, 
  year is 1507 and the game is going great !,

  ** to join : ** ** previously you would add me on steam . 
  this is not longer the case . 
  read below if you had added me on steam ** i had a filled friends list + way too many friends pinging so instead i decided to make a steam group . 
  [ this is / r/europe 's steam group ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/groups/europereddit ) . 
  it is open for anyone to join so you do n't even need an invitation . 
  once you are in , i 'll invite you when the invites start shortly before the games start . 
  you can also ask for invites in the steam group 's chat .
