  faq : - i did n't join last week , can i join now ? 
  answer : absolutely !, 
  you can also pick any nation unless someone played it previously , in which case , that someone has priority . 
  but if he is n't there when we play , you can take it . 
  - i can only join for 3 hours , not 5 , is that fine ? 
  answer : then join for 3 hours and leave before 5 . 
  that 's fine  - i came 10 minutes late and you have already started / i crashed / i got annexed and disconnected , what do ? 
  answer : we will be playing with a ton of people . 
  last week , we had a good 20-25 people joining the game . 
  that means we ca n't be restarting every time someone joins or disconnects . 
  we will be having 3 restarts total for everyone that came late or crashed to be able to rejoin . 
  - i am bad at this game you are absolutely welcome !, 
  - i have never played this game before you are also absolutely welcome but ... you probably wo n't enjoy this . 
  the game is super complicated and you wo n't understand shit and a 20-30 player game is usually a wild west mess so that would make it even harder to understand . 
  i would personally suggest skipping this week and trying the game in sp first . 
  it is really fun !, 
  - my internet is trash , can i join anyway ? 
  answer : sure but ... your internet probably ca n't handle it . 
  if you go out of synch , we wo n't be restarting just for you . 
  it 's just impractical , sorry !, 
  - any other rules ? 
  answer : no rules . 
  feel free to do anything the game allows . 
  that includes annexing other players , betraying and the rest . 
  please do n't be a dick about things though . 
  do n't keep someone occupied for a decade just to spite them and do n't refuse to accept a peace deal even if you are completely occupied . 
  basically , do n't be unessarily a dick when it comes to game mechanics . 
  have fun !,
