  last week , we had a good 20-25 people joining the game . 
  that means we ca n't be restarting every time someone joins or disconnects . 
  we will be having 3 restarts total for everyone that came late or crashed to be able to rejoin . 
  - i am bad at this game you are absolutely welcome !, 
  - i have never played this game before you are also absolutely welcome but ... you probably wo n't enjoy this . 
  the game is super complicated and you wo n't understand shit and a 20-30 player game is usually a wild west mess so that would make it even harder to understand . 
  i would personally suggest skipping this week and trying the game in sp first . 
  it is really fun !, 
  - my internet is trash , can i join anyway ? 
  answer : sure but ... your internet probably ca n't handle it . 
  if you go out of synch , we wo n't be restarting just for you . 
  it 's just impractical , sorry !, 
  - any other rules ? 
  answer : no rules . 
  feel free to do anything the game allows . 
  that includes annexing other players , betraying and the rest . 
  please do n't be a dick about things though . 
  do n't keep someone occupied for a decade just to spite them and do n't refuse to accept a peace deal even if you are completely occupied . 
  basically , do n't be unessarily a dick when it comes to game mechanics . 
  finally , last session 's aar written by the republic of italy 's consul , / u/dakarans [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/42813u/reuropes_eu4_campaign_round_5_coming_soon_details/czbgmxh ) have fun !,

  we are starting in 15 mins-ish hey again folks , on 6th of february at [ 7 pm gmt ] ( http://time.is/gmt ) we continue our eu4 campaign from last week . 
  the game , like last time , will last 5 hours but you can drop off at any time before that . 
  no hard feelings !, 
  ** to join : ** ** previously you would add me on steam . 
  this is not longer the case . 
  read below if you had added me on steam ** i had a filled friends list + way too many friends pinging so instead i decided to make a steam group . 
  [ this is / r/europe 's steam group ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/groups/europereddit ) . 
  it is open for anyone to join so you do n't even need an invitation . 
  once you are in , i 'll invite you when the invites start shortly before the games start . 
  you can also ask for invites in the steam group 's chat . 
  to join the actual eu4 game , please go open your [ `` friends list '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xo7jhjc.png ) in steam and right click the steam group to join chat . 
  only then can i invite you to the game !, 
  faq : - i did n't join last week , can i join now ? 
  answer : absolutely !, 
  you can also pick any nation unless someone played it previously , in which case , that someone has priority . 
  but if he is n't there when we play , you can take it . 
  - i can only join for 3 hours , not 5 , is that fine ? 
  answer : then join for 3 hours and leave before 5 . 
  that 's fine  - i came 10 minutes late and you have already started / i crashed / i got annexed and disconnected , what do ? 
  answer : we will be playing with a ton of people . 
  last week , we had a good 20-25 people joining the game .

  - is there a stream ? 
  yes !, 
  twitch.tv / beargoeswild streams it every session !, 
  go watch it if you guys want . 
  it even has the vods available . 
  - i am bad at this game you are absolutely welcome !,

  have fun !, 
  ** one additional thing/question : ** last session we had some discussion mid-game about whether or not picking vassals and colonial nations should be allowed and if there should be any limitations on whether or not they can declare independence ( or when ) . 
  please tell me what you guys think and whether or not we should continue the current laisez faire attitude towards that . 
  personally , i would support a rule where if you are below 50 % ld you should n't be acting directly hostile to your liege at the very least . 
  edit1 : game is hosted . 
  join up folks !, 
  edit2 : thank you all for coming !,
