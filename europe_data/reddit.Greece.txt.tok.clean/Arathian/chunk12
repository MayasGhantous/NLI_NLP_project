  use the descriptions from here https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3lelo2/greece_is_having_a_general_election_again_this/ he did the serious ones . 
  [ also , shameless plug of my thread  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3losmm/reuropes_semiofficial_greek_elections_thread_not/ ) if you want to discuss the elections in a less serious fashion . 
  that 's becaue he cherry picks articles that specifically say things he wants to say . 
  check his history , he does that all the time . 
  also , it is abc news , it 's like star of the us . 
  do n't take it too seriously . 
  it 's davidreiss666 . 
  he is one of the worst propagandists and agenda pushers on reddit . 
  just ignore him , downvote the thread and move on . 
  i would n't necessarily use that word to describe that . 
  10 minute bus ride ( right outside my house ) to the metro . 
  metro to work takes about 40 minutes . 
  average total is 1 hour commute . 
  i have a car but the commute would be closer to 40-45 minutes instead of an hour and it would be far more expensive . 
  also , i can just sit and read in the commute so it is n't half bad . 
  have you tried writting anything even slightly anti-ukrainian ? 
  heck , let 's keep it in a circlejerk i actually agree with . 
  during the greek crisis , most of the anti-austerity guys got shouted down . 
  hard . 
  i am pro-austerity myself but it was pretty obvious . 
  saying / r/europe did n't have circlejerks before is inaccurate . 
  we just did n't really have pro/anti immigration circlejerks . 
  men can use it as a dildo too man . 
  no need to be so judgemental . 
  hey , i would actually be very interested in those articles ( even if they are in german/behind a paywall ) . 
  can you link them if you have the time ? 
  he resigned from pm to cause snap elections . 
  he did n't resign from his party 's leadership . 
  he is running for pm again now . 
  its regime 's mentality certainly is . 
  you are correct . 
  i find no extensive research on support of blasphemy laws . 
  i do think though that related evidence ( such as suicide bombing support ) , however , supports the original sentiment of johnr83 . 
  additional sources from pewresearch http://www.pewresearch.org/files/old-assets/pdf/muslim-americans.pdf#page=60 35 % of young muslims in gb believe suicide bombings targetting civilians are justifiable . 
  it 's bad and it 's a shame . 
  romanians are great and good immigrants too . 
  unfortunately in greece we have a strong `` romanian '' ( see : gypsy ) mafia giving you a bad name . 
  in greece , we have all 3 . 
  both mean chigans . ), 
  yes , teh zoos diddit . 
  never mind that muslims are persecuting jews throughout europe . 
  never mind that most proudly european jewish organizations oppose islamic migration for those reasons . 
  this is n't the 20th century . 
  get your conspiracies up to date . 
  jews do n't drink baby blood . 
  jews do n't poison christian wells . 
  jews do n't have some over-convoluted 70 year plan in brewing to destroy europe . 
  seriously . 
  i am offended now . 
  shame on you / u/bowgentle . 
  this is a great idea . 
  we needed a meta-specific sub for a long time now . 
  i am still trying to figure out any really solid arguements against ttip , personally . 
  ttip will reduce regulation in certain products ... okey ... but those products are safe in the first place . 
  unless you are anti-gmo , why would you have a problem with that ? 
  where the fuck did you people crop up from . 
  wherever that is from , please go back there . 
   they need to go somewhere . 
  yes , back . 
   they 're human beings , let them in damn it . 
  them being human being does n't entitle them to being in europe . 
  so no , we wo n't let them in , damn it . 
  i think the savanna refers to an actual savanna , rather than a name . 
  yes , there is an official way . 
  check https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3l0w1e/hungary_declares_a_state_of_emergency_at_border/cv27ott it 's a good comment . 
  they implemented criminal laws for tresspassing the borders illegally starting with a 3 year prison time . 
  interesting . 
  yeah , it sounded like a dane trying to speak english . 
  made about as much sense too . 
  well , if that is your definition of a `` takeover organizing '' , i would n't be too worried because it will fail since it is so poorly ` organized ' . 
  he probably did . 
  providing information about bombs to someone who , to the best of your knowledge , is a terrorist , even if the information is wrong , is still a criminal offence . 
  so if i go to srs under an alt and keep posting on how we need to take over / r/europe , that means / r/europe is under the threat of an srs takeover ? 
  the fact that the thread was made by a troll disproves any alegation of a stormfront invasion in this sub unless further evidence of such takeover exist . 
  as of now , to the best of my knowledge , they do n't . 
  yeah , the guy was completely crazy , not denying that . 
  i am just saying that this news story is not really something we can draw any political conclusion from , in my honest opinion . 
  the guy would make multiple personas then try to urge different communities to witch hunt his other personas from opposing communities . 
  also , let 's hope this revelation means the paranoid `` stormfront is organizing a takeover of / r/europe '' shit can finally stop . 
  the guy was n't a neo-nazi false flag , he was just an a class troll . 
  he wrote anti-gamergate articles then with another persona he urged for witchhunts against his anti-gg persona . 
  he was a frequent poster in srs under another persona . 
  he had some weird ultra-feminist blog and he also wrote some `` incel pick up artist '' blog . 
  the guy was just a no life troll . 
  trying to assume there is some narrative here is misleading in the extreme . 
  radical feminism is inherently batshit insane same way nazism and communism is . 
  however , this does n't disqualify them from doing good thing ever . 
  this is one of those . 
  wan na bet on it ? 
  these type of comments always get downvoted here . 
  edit : i win . 
  a single downvoted guy is the `` new / r/europe '' ? 
  damn . 
  if we go by that rule , can i try it myself by tranforming / r/europe into a place to discuss the impact of warhammer philosophy in the labour leadership elections ? 
  teehee indeed . 
  anti-semitism never meant against all semitic people though , it meant specifically against jews from its inception by the anti-semitic party of germany ( real name ) . 
  i honestly do n't think the champagne popping is without merit , but time will tell . 
  2 years while labour is approaching elections preparation period . 
  they are n't . 
  cameron is probably popping champagnes right about now .
