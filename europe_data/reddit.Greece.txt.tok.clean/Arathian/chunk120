  twitch.tv / beargoeswild streams it every session !, 
  go watch it if you guys want . 
  it even has the vods available . 
  - i am bad at this game you are absolutely welcome !, 
  - i have never played this game before you are also absolutely welcome but ... you probably wo n't enjoy this . 
  the game is super complicated and you wo n't understand shit and a 20-30 player game is usually a wild west mess so that would make it even harder to understand . 
  i would personally suggest skipping this week and trying the game in sp first . 
  it is really fun !, 
  - my internet is trash , can i join anyway ? 
  answer : sure but ... your internet probably ca n't handle it . 
  if you go out of synch , we wo n't be restarting just for you . 
  it 's just impractical , sorry !, 
  - any other rules ? 
  answer : no rules . 
  feel free to do anything the game allows . 
  that includes annexing other players , betraying and the rest . 
  please do n't be a dick about things though . 
  do n't keep someone occupied for a decade just to spite them and do n't refuse to accept a peace deal even if you are completely occupied . 
  basically , do n't be unessarily a dick when it comes to game mechanics . 
  have fun !, 
  hey again folks , on the 20th of february at [ 7 pm gmt ] ( http://time.is/gmt ) we continue our eu4 campaign from last week . 
  the game , like last time , will last 5 hours but you can drop off at any time before that . 
  no hard feelings !, 
  ** to join : ** ** previously you would add me on steam . 
  this is not longer the case . 
  read below if you had added me on steam ** i had a filled friends list + way too many friends pinging so instead i decided to make a steam group . 
  [ this is / r/europe 's steam group ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/groups/europereddit ) . 
  it is open for anyone to join so you do n't even need an invitation . 
  once you are in , i 'll invite you when the invites start shortly before the games start . 
  you can also ask for invites in the steam group 's chat . 
  to join the actual eu4 game , please go open your [ `` friends list '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xo7jhjc.png ) in steam and right click the steam group to join chat . 
  only then can i invite you to the game !, 
  ** faq : ** - i did n't join last week , can i join now ? 
  answer : absolutely !, 
  you can also pick any nation unless someone played it previously , in which case , that someone has priority . 
  but if he is n't there when we play , you can take it . 
  - i can only join for 3 hours , not 5 , is that fine ? 
  answer : then join for 3 hours and leave before 5 . 
  that 's fine  - i came 10 minutes late and you have already started / i crashed / i got annexed and disconnected , what do ? 
  answer : we will be playing with a ton of people . 
  last week , we had a good 20-25 people joining the game . 
  that means we ca n't be restarting every time someone joins or disconnects . 
  we will be having 3 restarts total for everyone that came late or crashed to be able to rejoin .

  hey again folks , on the 5th of march at [ 7 pm gmt ] ( http://time.is/gmt ) we start our ** new eu4 campaign ** after finishing the last one . 
  the game , unlike last time , will last 4 hours per session because previously people said 5 hours was a bit much . 
  it 'll be ending at a more reasonable hour for most people which is a good thing . 
  anyways , you can drop off at any time before that . 
  no hard feelings !, 
  we only ask to please take a major nation only if you 're going to be sticking it out with us regularly , because major nations , at least at first , affect the balance of the game a lot and it 'll be more fun for everyone if they do n't get imploded by the ai . 
  * p.s. 
  no reason you ca n't become the most powerful starting from a minor nation - that actually happened in the last game . 
  * ** to join : ** [ this is / r/europe 's steam group ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/groups/europereddit ) . 
  it is open for anyone to join so you do n't even need an invitation . 
  there are two ways to join the actual game . 
  ** first way : ** once you are in , we can invite you , just remind us to in the steam group 's chat . 
  you can also directly join by clicking join game on someone already in the lobby that is also in the group chat . 
  ** second way : ** dakarans should be hosting , but you can send me ( the hound ) , arathian ( arathian ) or dakarans ( dakarans ) a friend invite and then you can join the game through us by : * entering eu4 and going into the multiplayer window ( if you were in single player , you need to restart eu4 ) * open your friends list where one of us is * click on that person 's profile * click join game button as pictured here [ friend profile ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oiyscji.png ) ** faq : ** * - do we use some sort of communication tool ? 
  * yes !, 
  for anything other than super secret plots ( for which we recommend eu4 's whisper functionality ) , we use teamspeak . 
  you do n't have to join it , but we strongly recommend it . 
  if you do n't know how to set it up , please ask . 
  the teamspeak server details are : address : 185.4.149.102:9152 room : eu4game password : europe ** - i did n't play last session/last week , can i join now ? 
  ** ** answer : ** absolutely !, 
  the usual rule is that you can also pick any nation unless someone played it previously , in which case , that someone has priority . 
  but if he is n't there when we play , you can take it for at least that session . 
  if an absentee going to be late to a session and do n't want to lose your nation please post in the weekly thread so we know you 'll be showing up . 
  if you give notice , you can miss ** one ** whole session and still have the right to your nation when you come back . 
  ** since this is a new game , we will be picking nations from scratch . 
  ** you can reserve a nation here in this thread , or you can simply pick what 's available when the game starts . 
  you can drop in at the last minute if you wish . 
  ** importantly ** - please choose one of the major nations only if you intend to show up every week . 
  ** - i can only join for 3 hours , not 4 , is that fine ? 
  ** ** answer : ** then join for 3 hours and leave before 4 . 
  that 's fine  ** - i came 10 minutes late and you have already started / i crashed / i got annexed and disconnected , what do ? 
  ** ** answer : ** we will be playing with a ton of people . 
  that means we unfortunately ca n't be restarting every time someone joins or disconnects . 
  we will be having 3 or so restarts total for everyone that came late or crashed to be able to rejoin , so it 's not the end of the world . 
  ** - i am bad at this game ** you are absolutely welcome !, 
  most of us were n't experienced players in the last game and we had a ton of fun with a lot of wars , plots , politics , etc. 
  ** - i have never played this game before ** you are also absolutely welcome but ... you probably wo n't enjoy this . 
  the game is super complicated and you wo n't understand most things and a 20-30 player game is usually a wild west mess so that would make it even harder to understand . 
  i would personally suggest skipping this week and trying the game in sp first - and then join us once you know at least some basics . 
  it is really fun !,
