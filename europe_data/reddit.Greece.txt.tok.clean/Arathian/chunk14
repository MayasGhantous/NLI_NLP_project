  our winters are , what in the north could be considered , a rather nice spring day often times . 
  the winters are short and timid , spring is very long and warm , summer has its blistering hot days but a ) ac exists and b ) seas exist . 
  look , i am not saying you ca n't enjoy your weather , but humans , in general , tend to prefer more temperate climates which the mediterenean is a prime example of . 
  you are correct , they are afghan . 
  i see no empirical or statistical evidence that such impact exists . 
  i am not downplaying it , i am completely denying its existence . 
  japan 's economy has n't been doing well for reasons completely unrelated to aging . 
  you are also [ wrong ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_median_age ) . 
  it is monaco , then germany then japan . 
  two of those countries have a thriving economy which , i think , proves that aging is pretty much unrelated to economic performance . 
  increased productivity and rising life expectancy compensates for increased age . 
  the economy shifting from a labour-intensive one to a service economy means that people can stay in the workforce longer without serious health risks . 
  you are making it out to be a much larger problem than it really is . 
  germany has one of the highest average ages in the world ( i think , in fact , the highest one ) and their economy is doing fantastic . 
  which is why china has had such a terrible economy the past 30 years ? 
  also , if you took any economics classes * beyond * 101 , you would know that modern economists mainly look at growth and gdp per capita , not simply gdp any more . 
  the idea that a falling population is `` bad for the economy '' is absurd . 
  this has been posted before . 
  links/source ? 
  when the summer here is maybe a week long , you start missing the heat . 
  then again , my house in athens has ac in every room :p, 
  i miss greek heat . 
  oh well , next summer i guess !, 
  as / u/letruepatriot cited , only a fraction of the current rejected applicants get deported . 
  by past , i referred to workers moving to germany that were supposed to be temporary . 
  while they were supposed to leave after a few years , they ended up staying which is how germany got its large turkish minority . 
  yes , but you do n't and historically have n't . 
  i do n't have an inherent problem with you calling yourselves `` republic of macedonia '' . 
  however , before that happens , 2 things should become true , that currently are n't : - you should recognize that you are n't the only macedonia and that there is , to the south of you , a greek macedonia too . 
  - that the ancient kingdom of macedon was greek or , at the very least , not in any way related to your country ethnically . 
  basically , you should stop trying to infringe on my nation 's history and sovereignty and i would be happy to let you name yourselves however you want . 
  i do n't think that request it is unreasonable or unfair . 
  but not on the ancient kingdom of macedon that they claim historical descend from . 
  the ancient kingdom of macedon did not extend to modern day fyrom . 
  that was occupied by the kingdom of the paionians . 
  http://macedonia-evidence.org/documentation.html#calledpaioniainantiquity here , more detail on the region 's naming throughout the years . 
  the macedonia you linked there was the byzantine ( and latter ottoman ) province of macedonia which was far larger than the macedons ' core kingdom and was also 1000 + years latter . 
  fyroms politicians are n't giving that air of confidence though . 
  you would be hard pressed to find even the most hardcore nationalists in greece claiming parts of fyrom . 
  not so hard-pressed to find maps of fyrom that claim greek land . 
  sure , [ here ] ( http://history-of-macedonia.com/2007/03/12/macedonians-in-olympic-games/ ) are some examples with alexander 's grandfather participation in the olympics ( only greeks were allowed ) and the dispute with the hellenodikes . 
  this is described in the herodotus ( as the article says ) . 
  a quote from alexander in a speech : `` youths of the pellaians and of the macedonians and of the hellenic amphictiony and of the lakedaimonians and of the corinthians ... and of all the hellenic peoples , join your fellow-soldiers and entrust yourselves to me , so that we can move against the barbarians and liberate ourselves from the persian bondage , ** for as greeks we should not be slaves to barbarians . 
  ** '' as quoted in the historia alexandri magni of pseudo-kallisthenes , 1.15.1-4 etc etc it takes very little research to find out that the macedonians considered themselves fully greek . 
  actually , the argument is more if other greeks considered them greek . 
  it 's a bit complicated for 2 reasons : macedonia was a kingdom which was considered a barbaric form of governance by the city-states . 
  additionally , macedonians were on the border and were frequently occupied ( or themselves occupied ) foreigners leading to some mixing . 
  even then , the majority of greeks ( as witnessed by the hellenodikes arguement ) considered them greek with most that opposed their greekness did so on mostly political grounds . 
   i think the ancient macedonians would 've called themselves greek if they were that they did call themselves greek . 
  frequently , in fact . 
  yeah , only it 's relevant to us . 
  macedonians were , and are , greeks . 
  if someone decides to rebrand himself to justify his independent existence as a country by stealing our culture , it suddenly makes it relevant . 
  technically , modern fyrom falls almost entirely out of the alexander era core macedonia borders . 
  their location was mostly occupied by a hellenized thracian tribe called paionians . 
  it 's quite rediculus . 
  how come you did n't also link [ \u03b2\u03ac\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bf \u039d\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03c3\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upwigvjhpio&amp;ab_channel=afthentikos42 . ) . 
  it is very famous too and it also makes fun of the italians during ww2 . 
  [ this is the superior version , i feel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wljpl6petn8&amp;ab_channel=korzako889 ), 
  you would be a great mod !, 
  not sure how i missed this application . 
  + you fill an improtant time slot . 
  men are more capable of supporting themselves in war situations than toddlers , elderly and women . 
  so no , not `` fuck men '' , but men should be a lower priority in these instances . 
  well , i have met a few that do hate their culture . 
  they were the ones that left it though , so that makes sense . 
  well , he did ... how is that relevant to the current state of affairs ? 
  as long as they are free to return home , i do n't see it as a huge issue . 
  obviously the camps can be improved but it * is * a voluntary thing , in the end of the day . 
  i think you would be a great moderator !, 
  i want to preface this application by saying i do n't believe i am the best choice . 
  i love this sub and post here frequently and i genuinely want it improved however , at the same time , i can get cranky and combative and have been in quite a few beefs in this sub . 
  if this was an application thread for a single moderator , i probably would n't even bother . 
  however , i am applying for what , i believe , is a good reason and one most of this subreddit can get behind . 
  for more details , check `` why do you want to be a moderator '' . 
  --  how often are you on reddit in an average week ? 
  that depends on how much work i have . 
  however , i usually browse reddit at least 1-2 hours a day and , sometimes , it can be way , waaaay more than that . 
  it 's kind of embarrassing , really . 
  --  how often do you visit / r/europe ? 
  the vast majority of my lurking time on reddit is in / r/europe . 
  the majority of my posts are also in / r/europe . 
  so ... quite often . 
  --  what country are you normally resident in ? 
  i move a lot due to work but , for the foreseeable future , i will be residing in east coast canada . 
  that means i mainly lurk in the off hours where most people are asleep . 
  --  do you speak any languages besides english ? 
  ( if yes : which and to what level ? ), 
  my mother tongue is greek . 
  i can also understand some german , although i am very rusty in them . 
  --  what interests you about europe ? 
  i was born here  but besides the obvious , i like european politics and have some basic understanding of most countries ' current political situation . 
  i am mostly in / r/europe to discuss its politics and their effects on the population . 
  -- edit : oups , forgot this one !, 
   what are your favourite and least favourite things about / r/europe ? 
  favourite : this sub has many great discussions frequently , which is rather rare for most subreddits this size . 
  i honestly think this is the greatest strength of this sub . 
  this and many fun tibits and top bantz about various european nations . 
  least favourite : this sub has too many camps that yell at each other with no intention of ever changing their minds . 
  this directly hurts my favourite thing about this subreddit .
