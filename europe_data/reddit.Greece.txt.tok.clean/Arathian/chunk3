  you people are simply so fucking dense that you think everybody is here to serve you . 
  no , we ai n't . 
  however , when they are killing your neighbours that , until previously , held all the power , discriminated against you and fired you from your job because you did n't have the correct religion you might just not go out of your way to help them without assurances that this wo n't happen again . 
  believing people have a right to leech off people who are working simply because they have the privilege to live in the right place is a terrible thing to believe , yeah . 
   what do you want me to do , go work in macdonald 's ? 
  why , yes !, 
  in fact , if you do n't , i quite believe you deserve to starve to death !, 
  benefits should , at the very least , go to people who have a proven record to trying to get a job . 
  these people do n't and do n't deserve a penny . 
  no society should have members that live comfortably by leeching off of it . 
  are you working for any major or minor agency ? 
  if not , do you have any specific material that you produced ? 
  if not , do you have someone who works for an agency that vouches for you ? 
  if the answer is no to all 3 , then you are not a journalist . 
  this is called background checking and it is n't a new concept . 
  background checks . 
  if there is someone without enough background for even basic clearance , maybe we should n't get those . 
  that is what a civilized society does . 
   should we send them back to syria to keep fighting ? 
  if they are syrian ( or other m. east countries ) citizens with proven ties to isis , hand them over to the syrian government . 
   many of them would be danish citizens . 
  if they are danish citizens and not from other countries , jail them for terrorism and mass murder . 
  i know this is controversial around here , but i think ethnic cleansing , terrorism and mass murder is bad . 
  ridiculous , i know . 
  lock them up forever , yeah . 
  also consider expelling them to be tried for god damn warcrimes . 
  when did europe start excusing mass murdering war criminals ? 
  ok , i do n't think you understand what i am saying . 
  i know it is illegal to not pick them up and they should pick them up . 
  that is not what i am arguing . 
  what i am saying is that despite it being illegal , ship crews will start ignoring immigrant boats simply because it might cause them to be unemployed in the end . 
  see what i am saying ? 
  the legality of the situation is irrelevant . 
  `` i swear we did n't see em officer . 
  did you see them mark ? 
  yeah , me neither '' . 
  essentially , loan amount and loan interest is equal to the actual loan ( and that is my constant answer to people who say `` if we have more money why are we borrowing money '' , we are n't . 
  in theory , we are simply lowering our loan rate ) . 
  and yes , troika is not interested in actual restructuring however i would argue that ( besides not being interested/clever enough , since our politicians are mostly incompetent ) our politicians are unable to make a proper plan by themselves . 
  they do not have the political capital and wo n't have it for a long time . 
  i honestly have no fucking clue what we can currently do . 
  if you asked me 6 years ago , my answer would be `` go bankrupt , enter special status in eu , restructure economy from scrap on a more sustainable capitalist model . '' . 
  nowadays , we are just fucked , kinda . 
  we have no reserve capital to do shit and we have entered too much into the political and economical shitstorm to just peace out . 
  eh , first off , while greece supposedly has `` met '' its goals , it was done with a ton of data manipulation . 
  our debt is greater than ever and , actually , our loan interest rate is still extremely high so it is n't stabilized in any way . 
  not to mention to piss poor social conditions . 
  we ca n't work as an economy even if we shamble on . 
  we ca n't claim to be an independent , economically , nation when our unemployment is so high and shows no sign of improving . 
  basically , still fucked . 
  edit : also , people , could you stop downvoting a greek trying to talk about greece ? 
  say why you disagree , do n't simply downvote him . 
  and i think bnp are pretty trash , to be clear . 
  which , honestly , is a perfectly acceptable thing . 
  i expect a person who runs for a country 's leadership position to care for that country . 
  wallets are certainly a large part of said `` care '' . 
  i do n't know if i would support ukip if i was a brit , but i certainly know the whole `` ukip = fascist '' crap i keep seeing is bullshit . 
  i also eat kittens in my spare time . 
  yeah , because ukip is all about preserving a race . 
  also , they are made of straw and we should beat them without remorse . 
  but khmer rouge did n't reject those fundamentals , nor did stalin nor did mao . 
  they called themselves communists , they encouraged communist revolution and they tried to implement a system roughly similar to what was proposed by marx . 
  if every single attempt at implementing a system fails , the true problem is that none of them are truecommunists \u2122, 
  one might say they are no true communists , in fact . 
  capitalism is a socio-economic system where society perfectly allocates its finite resources to a population with infinite needs . 
  only that it does n't , so in every discussion about capitalism , we discuss its faults and failings , of which there are plenty . 
  communism is not exempt of that . 
  only that instead of period of fluctuating prosperity , communism has led directly to brutal dictatorships , genocides and purges . 
  i am tired of speaking to you . 
  you wo n't change your mind , mainly because yer a bloody moron , as i mentioned somewhere else . 
  good night . 
  which political system led to khmer rouge killing 60 % of the population of laos in 10 years ? 
  please inform me . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holodomor http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/katyn_massacre http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gulag http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cultural_revolution http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_leap_forward http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khmer_rouge etc etc etc you are a retarded individual . 
  please kindly educate yourself and/or do n't sprout moronic statements about things you have no idea about . 
  muslims that interacted with europe were mostly africans . 
  current immigrants are mostly muslim africans . 
  ergo , muslim africans are the ones we are discussing right now , making my comment 100 % relevant . 
  so fuck off . 
  deaths do n't change anything and they are tragic mate . 
  i understand your frustration but this is n't the answer . 
  we should n't shoot them on the spot for the same reason . 
  we wo n't become free of them if we become worse than them . 
  so does turkey and morocco . 
  why do n't we hold those countries as accountable ? 
   when was the last time your ancestors children had their hands cut off when they did n't meet their rubber quota ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dev%c5%9firme  when was the last time your ancestors died in the millions because of human planned and executed famines ? 
  \u0399 actually had a hard time picking an example here since they were so many . 
  but here are some . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_genocide  the greek genocide , part of which is known as the pontic genocide , was the systematic ethnic cleansing of the christian ottoman greek population from its historic homeland in asia minor , central anatolia , pontus , and the former russian caucasus province of kars oblast during world war i and its aftermath ( 1914 -- 23 ) . 
  it was instigated by the government of the ottoman empire against the greek population of the empire and it included massacres , forced deportations involving death marches , summary expulsions , arbitrary executions , and destruction of christian orthodox cultural , historical and religious monuments . 
  according to various sources , several hundred thousand ottoman greeks died during this period . 
  [ 3 ] some of the survivors and refugees , especially those in eastern provinces , took refuge in the neighbouring russian empire . 
  after the end of the 1919 -- 22 greco-turkish war , most of the greeks remaining in the ottoman empire were transferred to greece under the terms of the 1923 population exchange between greece and turkey . 
  other ethnic groups were similarly attacked by the ottoman empire during this period , including assyrians and armenians , and some scholars consider those events to be part of the same policy of extermination . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fall_of_constantinople http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constantinople_massacre_of_1821 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chios_massacre by the way , there is actually a famous painting about the brutality of this massacre http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_massacre_at_chios it was considered especially brutal even by that day 's standards . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/destruction_of_psara  but i am saying that a lot of africa 's present day trouble is because of european colonial times . 
  and i do n't give a shit . 
  edit : oh yeah , i forgot to add my favourite example , especially since it is actually less than half a century old . 
  are we ignoring the arab invasions of north africa , mali , ethiopia and somalia here ?
