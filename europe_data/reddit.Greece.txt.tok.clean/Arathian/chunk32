  spanish government seems to be well aware of the potential risks and preparing ahead for that eventuality . 
  i am a social libertarian . 
  i disagree with the law . 
  it is also completely irrelevant to the economy which is what you claim would cause the riots . 
  are you sure you are replying to the right guy mate ? 
   now i ask you : how would you have improven greece 's situation ? 
  i would followed the imf program . 
   greece is not and has not at any point been comparable to spain , portugal and especially ireland . 
  i will ignore ireland because i kind of agree there . 
  but spain and portugal are very much comparable to greece . 
  both have long term economic problems , government corruption , problems collecting taxes and high debts . 
  incidentally , they are both same climate , roughly same industries ( tourism , agriculture etc ) and same political culture ( dictatorships roughly 40 years ago followed by democracy ) . 
  i honestly ca n't think of countries that could make better comparisons . 
  can you tell me a single reason why they are n't comparable besides `` they just are n't '' ? 
   it was certainly getting there . 
  according to whom ? 
  for what reason ? 
  what indicators show that greece would have almost civil war and declare martial law for the first time in 50 years ? 
   given a few more months to a year , and that 's what would be happening . 
  no , in my opinion , since it is ridiculous unsubstantiated assertions time , the zog would finally put up with our pitiful existence and come blast all of greece out of the stratosphere as revenge for us electing nd . 
   let 's not forget that economy would n't actually get any better with them in power , and they too would have to impose further cuts that are being asked of syriza now . 
  much like it did n't for [ spain ] ( http://www.thespanisheconomy.com/portal/site/tse/menuitem.efbc5feeac2b3957b88f9b10026041a0/?vgnextoid=b1fd7e7b61b7f310vgnvcm1000002006140arcrd ) , [ portugal ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/eu/countries/portugal_en.htm ) or [ ireland ] ( http://www.cso.ie/indicators/maintable.aspx ) ? 
  yeah , i totally see that . 
   now tell me , what do people do when every third or soon to be second person has no income and no way to get any ? 
  do they sit at home and post on reddit ? 
  i do n't know , we 'll find out when syriza is done fucking up this country . 
   so yes , your city would very much be on fire at this point . 
  unless nd did the exact same things that syriza is doing , which they probably would have been forced to do anyway unless they 're outright insane . 
  [ sure thing boss ] ( https://i.warosu.org/data/tg/img/0277/77/1381962181773.jpg ), 
  oh yeah , just like the city was on fire before when nd was in power and we also had martial law before . 
  you forgot to add the nazi space aliens that would invade again if nd was re-elected . 
   it worked out significantly better than the alternative in the last elections . 
  what with us going bankrupt with the last government , banks not opening , wages up in the air and so the pensions . 
  thank god this government brought stability back and started fixing things . 
  i think varoufakis insists on what , in theory , should happen and forgets what is actually happening . 
  which is ... exactly what i said ? 
  the coe is not the eu . 
  you just have no clue what yer talking about . 
  whatever you say . 
  it is still fucking none of the coe 's bussiness . 
  if india or zimbabwe or the north american union commented on how the referendum was invalid , the proper response is `` fuck off , it 's none of your fucking bussiness '' . 
  this is a national matter of the highest importance and while we would all love to have a couple of months to talk it out , we do n't . 
  do we owe the council of europe money ? 
  they can fuck off , none of their bussiness . 
  that 's silly and irrelevant . 
  everyone knows what the questions mean . 
  no means `` fuck you europe and merkel '' . 
  yes mean `` maybe we can talk it out bby , pls '' the short period does n't matter that much either . 
  people have an opinion 5 years now on the whole thing . 
  once the smoke cleared up on what we would be voting on exactly the next day , people are ready . 
  as for coe ... none of their bussiness . 
  we er ... fully agree . 
  i am not being ironic . 
  i genuinely think kapodistrias was a fantastic politician . 
  it 's a joke . 
  i am sure people will understand  but yeah , especially kapodistrias and venizelos are shining examples of competent and good statesmen in my opinion . 
  as / u/gorat said : with [ kapodistria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ioannis_kapodistrias ) we went bankrupt and we put him in our coins . 
  with [ trikoupis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charilaos_trikoupis ) we went bankrupt and he has a highway named after him . 
  with [ venizelos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eleftherios_venizelos ) we went bankrupt and we named the god damn central airport after him . 
  we are probably naming the first greek space base after tsipras . 
  pls no bully i poor kid from ~ ~ brazi ~ ~ grease huehue, 
  i am financially secured as long as us dollars are worth anything , thanks for your concern . 
  just wan na point out the level of discourse in this country when you people literally say we vote * for killing children and unemployed * . 
  i am not sure if i should consider it hilarious or depressing . 
   i dont want any comparison with people that are actually are murdering their kids , unemployed people we also eat babies . 
  in fact , baby flambe is our specialty . 
   austerity measures such as the ones imposed on greece have not been imposed on the other countries , did you consider that ? 
  no , because it is n't true . 
  spain and portugal have both gotten pretty much the same demands as greece . 
  they simply implemented them much more efficiently and with less turmoil and push back . 
  now that the measures worked and their debt is back under control * of course they have it lighter than us * . 
  that 's the point of all of this !, 
   furthermore , i think it is more civil to keep all comments in english . 
  i have german friends myself , leftist ones ( yes , it is an actual thing ) and i discuss with them daily . 
  sure . 
  i insist that germans are n't out there to make the 4th reich . 
  i dislike the eu a lot but the blood is on our hands in this situation . 
   have you not seen the actual numbers i have . 
  perhaps you should too . 
  in 2014 , all southern eu countries were still in recession but it was quickly evening out . 
  today ( and i use spain as an example here because they are the most similar to us in terms of economy ) it has reversed and those countries are starting to recover . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.thespanisheconomy.com/portal/site/tse/menuitem.efbc5feeac2b3957b88f9b10026041a0/?vgnextoid=b1fd7e7b61b7f310vgnvcm1000002006140arcrd ) are more details if you want to check for yourself . 
  samaras did well . 
  greece was on the road to recovery and would be fine much like spain and portugal right now . 
  if `` corrupt '' samaras stayed in power , today we would n't be declaring bankruptsy . 
  oh , lol , no problem . 
  my father lives near ksilokastro . 
  small village . 
  he bought the house + fields with the money the greek army ( he was an officer ) withhold from your pay every month to give it as a lump sum at the end + savings he had gathered for that purpose . 
  he also essentially built the house himself with minimum cost over a decade . 
  both parties specifically avoided framing the question like that . 
  syriza did n't promise to tear apart the agreement but to fundamentally change it into a `` growth '' plan . 
  yes , it was moronic but the average person ate it up . 
  i am not this sub . 
  my respect for far leftists never existed in the first place . 
  the fact that you brought my country down does n't exactly generate much respect either . 
   i do n't even know why i 'm writing this . 
  you 'll probably say i 'm an idiot or something . 
  nah , you already stated that yourself . 
  read the full post  i am currently in canada and do well for myself .
