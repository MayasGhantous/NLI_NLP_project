  like waaaay far from it . 
  i am sure you know the politics of my country much better than i do . 
   just different ones than the troika . 
  such as ? 
  because the past month syriza has followed the old troika line to the end . 
   also , the greeks are dumb as shit and lazy motherfuckers who just leech from the good working people of europe like me . 
  go work , you parasite . 
   i personally hate a joke so it is n't funny k, 
  not necessarily kids ( although kids are certainly a part of it in my company . 
  i see many women simply drop off because family ) . 
  i simply think that , genetically , many women do n't prefer that lifestyle . 
  i might be wrong and it might be a myriad other things ( like societal pressure against it ) but it certainly is n't sexism . 
  literally nobody here gives a shit about your genitals . 
  it is a soulless corporation and , one of its advantages , is that it only cares about your output . 
  now , do n't get me wrong , i would never go for that lifestyle either ( i like my weeks off like this week thankyouverymuch ) but my simple conclusion is that more men tend to do it over women for reasons that do n't include sexism . 
  ... i have been drinking and i am tired and on my phone . 
  i hope what i write makes sense . 
  i would like a source for that because this is n't my experience . 
  my experience is that , simply , there are fewer qualified women because holding that position means an 100-120 hours a week job . 
  very few people are willing to do that and even fewer women . 
  nah , it is mostly based on traditionalist christianity than anything else . 
  is this the thread where leftists gather to hunt down anyone with dissenting opinions and call them daily stormer sockpuppets ? 
  because , honestly , i have never seen jew hating in this subreddit . 
  i actually made a bigger list before , but it accidentally closed : < [ \u03a0\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03bd\u03ac\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bf \u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 !, 
  - the army is passing through ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r31rh66mv6q ) : the most common and famous greek march . 
  - greece never dies ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iq1z99izju ) : a song that was written after the devastation of ww2 . 
  it sings about the destruction wrought to greece and how we can rebuilt despite that . 
  * cough * germany * cough * now , these are not marches , but war songs , so here . 
  [ \u038e\u03bc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0395\u0391\u039c - hymn of eam ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnafaim-s8m ) : the song of the commie resistance in greece during ww2 . 
  it is based on katyusha .

  my grandfather was a member of that one !, 
  \\  people like marches \\  means people are daily stormer pls go away, 
  we are more brothers than we would like to admit . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ gib ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ back ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ constantinople ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ pls, 
  jews do blood rituals and steal babies . 
  obviously . 
  yep , it is honestly a bit surprising that these people still hate jews when there are actual , real problems in europe . 
  you mean the new kievan government right ? 
  the one who , on purpose , antagonized the russian minority and removed russian as an official language . 
  why would you assume that ? 
  we are one of the most conservative countries in europe . 
  hi , thank you for your contribution , but this submission has been removed because it is not on-topic for this subreddit .

  also , it 's not really international news . 
  what some racist is doing in a university is local news , but it 's also off topic so yeah .

  man remember the ship threads a month ago or the passport ones a few months back ? 
  fun times . 
  nothing we can do . 
  this is reddit 's feature , not ours . 
  there is nothing wrong inherently with right wingers ( or left wingers ) . 
  the problem is that many people , both left and right , see discussion as arguments and see opposing views as personal attacks . 
  now that the sub is more right wing , you see more right wingers do that and bury left wingers . 
  if it was more left you would see the opposite , and it does happen with subs like / r/circlebroke or / r/subredditdrama where right wing opinions get instantly yelled down . 
  this has little to do with `` left wing '' or `` right wing '' and all to do with the attitudes and expectations we set . 
  as mods , we can probably improve that without touching any politics . 
  i think apolitical moderation is best moderation . 
  peruvians in n. america are the russians of europe only worse . 
  this triggers my dota ptsd ; _ ;, 
  think of the silver lining . 
  you get to eat delicious pork gyros and also gather around a lamb , poling it pretending you know your shit and getting drunk with friends and family every easter . 
  the friendship force has arrived . 
  we have / r/drama for that :p,

  no personal attacks . 
  you are reading too much into my joke . 
  you specifically responded to a post about banning gmos . 
  currently , gmos are both allowed and widely available in the eu . 
  cool , i 'll read it thanks . 
  thought you meant the opposite in your post ( that the limited biodiversity was n't the only problem ) . 
  i had n't read the rest of the thread first . 
  i am not willing to pay triple for my food ( and that is a low estimate if we ban gmos ) . 
  many greeks ca n't pay triple and will starve . 
  greece is both in europe and the eu . 
  i am in full support of gmos for that reason . 
  well , could you bring any other argument ? 
  imagine never having to deal with bullshit from either kurds or syrians .
