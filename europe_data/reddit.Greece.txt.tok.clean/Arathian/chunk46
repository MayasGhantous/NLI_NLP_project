  sure , i have non problem with austerity . 
  but austerity should also not be used to choke economies . 
  as with everything in economics , context is important sometimes , a large but brief overspending could stave off a collapse in the economy . 
  sometimes it 's needed for defense reasons . 
  sometimes a country is mathematically bankrupt so no matter how much austerity it implements , it will continue to be mathematically bankrupt . 
  all is context and all that . 
  oh man , such a union would certainly be an empire . 
  but oh , some people might question its legitimacy . 
  i say , the best way would be to name the empire after its oldest country , to give it legitimacy . 
  and of course , all but one of those countries share a common head of state so we are keeping her . 
  basically , i , for one , am okey with a british empire under her majesty , 
  i would have personally agreed in 2008 . 
  the problem with defaulting * now * is that no one has money any more . 
  not the state , not the people . 
  the economy is in ruins and dying . 
  in 2008 , things were n't great by any means , but we still had a relatively healthy base . 
  people still had enough reserves to hold themselves for a couple of years of hardship , maybe more . 
  but nowadays , a default would literally be a death sentence for too many people to be acceptable .

  ** full text : ** few places reveal the anguish of a frozen conflict better than the 180km long buffer zone between the internationally recognised republic of cyprus and the breakaway turkish republic of northern cyprus ( trnc ) . 
  in nicosia , the island 's divided capital , barbed wire and sandbags separate a fashionable caf\u00e9 from an abandoned bookshop . 
  the former opened last year . 
  the latter closed in the summer of 1974 , when turkish troops invaded the north of the island following years of ethnic bloodshed and a greek cypriot coup . 
  deeper in the demilitarized zone , a flock of sheep graze along the runway of an old international airport , a cavernous time capsule littered with broken glass and forty years of bird droppings . 
  an airplane rusts nearby . 
  the scene does not inspire much hope . 
  but analysts believe that a solution to the cyprus dispute may be more likely now than at any time in the past decade . 
  what has changed ? 
  reunification talks between the greek south and the turkish north started less than a year after the turkish invasion . 
  the closest they came to fruition was in april 2004 , when a plan brokered by the united nations was put to a nationwide referendum . 
  ( turkish cypriots backed the deal . 
  their greek neighbours rejected it by a three-to-one margin . 
  a week later , cyprus entered the eu as a divided island , with the north effectively frozen out of the bloc and recognized by only one country , turkey . ), 
  the election of mustafa akinci as president of the trnc in the spring of 2015 breathed new life into the peace process . 
  both mr akinci and the greek cypriot leader , nicos anastasiades , now say that a settlement is possible by the end of the year . 
  the eurasia group , a consultancy , puts that likelihood at 60 % . 
  the islanders themselves are less optimistic . 
  in a recent poll , 62 % of greek cypriots said reunification seemed no closer today than one year ago many of the pieces needed for a solution are in place . 
  mr akinci and mr anastasiades , having met at least 25 times , report that consensus is within reach in several areas , including governance , property , and the application of eu law in the north . 
  turkey , which has enough problems to deal with inside its own borders , has publicly backed an agreement . 
  without cyprus on board , recep tayyip erdogan 's government can not hope to unlock stalled membership talks with the eu . 
  ( mr anastasiades stresses he will `` never '' drop his veto on the negotiations `` unless turkey gives some signs that they mean business . '' ) the changing regional energy map also favours a deal . 
  greek cypriots know that reunification might be their only chance to market the island 's offshore gas deposits , possibly through an israeli pipeline to turkey ( assuming those two also manage to reconcile ) . 
  `` if we have a solution , we will be able to exploit our natural gas , '' says one former negotiator . 
  `` if not , nobody knows how turkey will behave . '' yet the road to a deal remains mined with misgivings and disagreements over territory , power sharing , and security guarantees . 
  in the economically stunted north , any agreement will have to allay fears of a flood of greek cypriot capital and underrepresentation in the governing bodies of a united island . 
  to be palatable in the south , it will have to ensure property restitution and the withdrawal of the 40,000 turkish troops stationed in the trnc . 
  another hurdle is the cost of a settlement . 
  even with a mix of remedies , including reinstatement and property swaps , compensating the 160,000 greek and 40,000 turkish cypriots who abandoned their homes in the 1970s will cost billions of euros . 
  there is fear that the momentum is ebbing . 
  the talks have already slowed ahead of a may 22 parliamentary vote in the south . 
  in the north , mr. akinci faces potential pushback from a newly formed cabinet headed by hardliners . 
  an increasingly unpredictable turkey may yet throw a wrench in the works . 
  `` the longer the talks go on , the greater the chance that we could see problems arise , '' says james ker-lindsay at the london school of economics . 
  after four decades of talks and spilled ink , cypriots have reason to hope for the best and prepare for the usual . 
  do feel free to pm us at modmail with a link of your original ban messages !, 
  i know nothing about your bans . 
  if you want to discuss them further , i probably am not the mod for it . 
  usually if a ban if fully reversed we remove the tag . 
  your tag is not removed . 
   are you profiling me ? 
  yes . 
  you got tagged for your bans . 
  tagging is essentially keeping the history ( good and bad ) of users . 
  for example , if a very good comment is made , you get a good contributor tag . 
  if you get banned , you get a banned tag ( and how long along with a comment ) . 
  that way we can keep track of repeat offenders or good contributors . 
  we do n't ban content , we ban low quality . 
  there is a significant difference between the two . 
  sure thing . 
  do note that shitposting and flooding are both bannable though . 
  that entirely depends on what they are . 
  if , for example , a picture brings up statistics with no context/sources , it will be removed . 
  if it 's just a picture of a pretty mountain and it goes `` pretty mountain in austria '' it wo n't be removed . 
  basically , if it needs context , it should have context . 
  just the other guy . 
  do n't worry , yer not banned ( or warned , or tagged , or anything . 
  do you honestly think if we were biased as you claim we would tolerate any opposing viewpoints ? 
  i mean , seriously now , mods have basically infinite power over a subreddit . 
  if we wanted , we could ban anyone posting here and make this a subreddit about posting kittens . 
  it would n't even be against reddit 's rules either . 
  just look at the shitshow over at / r/punchablefaces i am personally a right winger and anti-immigration .
