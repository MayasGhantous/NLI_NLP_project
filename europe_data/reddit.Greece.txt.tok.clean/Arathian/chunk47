  the mod team has people both on the left and the right ... as we should . 
  no viewpoint is getting suppressed here . 
  we do n't have some master evil plan . 
  we are just trying to maintain a certain quality in the sub . 
  the reason the other thread was deleted is because we do n't allow context-less youtube videos . 
  this thread is allowed because it is linking to an article . 
  so nothing to do with the story itself , as the now-banned fellow was trying to bullshit about . 
  it is of course a big article with international concerns . 
  however , the actual story ( which is what we judge them by in / r/europe ) took place in eastern turkey , which is outside europe . 
  similarly , if there were large skirmishes between syria and turkey in the border , this would n't be allowed in / r/europe even though it is clearly a big matter simply because it falls outside the scope . 
  this is actually the 2nd article we remove on this story and i have had this conversation before . 
  so i 'll just copy-paste what i told the other op ( to which he agreed ) :  generally speaking , we do consider turkey-wide issues as `` europe '' because turkey is a european country . 
    however , localized issues ( even if the issues do n't fall under what can be called ` local news ' ) that are on the eastern part of turkey ( or any other country that is both inside and outside europe , like russia ) are kinda more murky territory . 
  for example , as must_warn_others said , if a conflict on the turkish-syrian border happens , that usually falls outside the scope of / r/europe . 
    by the way , this is n't a pro-turkish bias or anything . 
  i am greek myself and are sad to see mistreatment of churches like this . 
  i just think we need to make sure that / r/europe does n't devolve into `` worldnews lite '' . 
  i mean , we have people for a long time that yell at us for not allowing trump articles because `` trump will affect europe you guys '' . 
  turkey is in europe . 
  localized news from the eastern part of turkey are n't . 
  nyt and / r/europe use different definitions then . 
  yeah pretty much there is a thread about this incident i approved here https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ga6sg/london_marathon_people_seen_taking_water_left_for/, 
  my apologies , but this did n't happen in europe . 
  my feelings go out to armenians and it suddens me personally to see this happen , but it still is n't europe .

  [ the video in question ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6m7o1ufg3e ) it should be noted that per [ this article ] ( http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/london-marathon-2016-race-organisers-to-investigate-after-video-shows-crates-of-water-bottles-being-a3232496.html )  `` we 'll investigate this further . ''   a spokesman for the metropolitan police service told the standard they were aware of the video but added they had received no allegations of theft and no arrests had been made . 
  thanks to / u/dvtxc for the article , by the way . 
  as a reminder , xenophobia against americans is still xenophobia and still bannable . 
  you are not banned but take this as a warning .

  we generally do n't allow youtube videos by themselves . 
  if it was the opposite ( aka op posted the article then linked the video in the comments ) i would be happy to allow it . 
  in fact , if you want , do that and i 'll approve it . 
   ** bannable **  additionally , holocaust denial ( of either the 1915 armenian genocide or the 1941-5 holocaust of the jews , homosexuals , the disabled , jehovah 's witnesses , etc. ), 
  is completely unacceptable . 
  that 's also a reminder to everyone . 
  if you openly deny the armenian genocide , the holocaust etc you ** will ** be banned .

  sure !, 
  the article is sourced , sure . 
  that does n't mean the article itself is n't biased though . 
  it 's from rt and rt is known to have a specific bias . 
   you do n't seem to apply this standard to other media outlets because other media outlets are reliable . 
  rt is n't . 
  we specifically remove rt. 
  so yes , we do n't apply it equally because they are not the same . 
   would you rather have the german article submitted ? 
  sure , with a translation . 
  or if you want , you can post a reliable source reporting on it . 
  then post the source .

  cut it off , both of you . 
  cut it off , both of you . 
   so many traitorous fools please refrain from using such rhetoric in the future . 
  how so ? 
  the whole point of the good friday agreement was to stop the violence , not to legitimize former terrorists or their supporters . 
  people who supported terrorism and terrorists themselves should naturally be shunned .

  turkey 's in europe . 
  it has a large amount of land in europe , had its capital in europe for 500 years . 
  it 's in europe . 
  dearest person who reported this : turkey is in europe . 
  spamming `` not europe '' is reportable to the admins .
