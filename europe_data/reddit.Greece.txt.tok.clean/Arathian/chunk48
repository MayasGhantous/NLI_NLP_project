  full text : zipping across the choppy aegean in his powerboat , nassos karakitsos , a volunteer with a search-and-rescue ngo called emergency response centre international , scans the horizon for refugees . 
  he spots none . 
  a few months ago the seas around the greek island of lesbos were filled with overstuffed rubber dinghies ( `` balloons with engines '' , mr karakitsos calls them ) carrying afghans , iraqis and syrians from the turkish coast . 
  today they are home only to the more forbidding vessels of the greek coast guard , frontex ( the european union 's border agency ) and nato , lately arrived to help with maritime surveillance . 
  the quiet seas are the result of a deal struck between the eu and turkey to reduce migrant flows , which came into effect on march 20th . 
  it took everyone by surprise , says a european official on lesbos , and there were teething troubles : the police tailed a turkish liaison officer stationed on the island , suspecting he was a spy . 
  but for now the migrants have stopped coming . 
  some of the scrappy volunteer groups that flocked to lesbos last autumn , when 6,000 refugees might clamber ashore in one day , are closing shop . 
  larger organisations are moving staff to mainland greece , where 46,000 refugees have been trapped by the closure of the macedonian border . 
  the drama has shifted to greek ministries , eu agencies and the quasi-prisons on aegean islands created by the turkey deal . 
  on lesbos , all arrivals are taken to moria , a `` hotspot '' ( processing centre ) turned detention camp . 
  most will face return once their asylum claims have been found inadmissible , on the ground that they reached greece from turkey , now considered a safe country for asylum-seekers . 
  ( deportations of migrants who did not claim asylum in greece have already begun . ), 
  activists consider the deal a shameful abrogation of the eu 's commitment to human rights . 
  the pope , who has attacked europe 's `` anaesthetised conscience '' on refugees , will visit lesbos on april 16th . 
  well over 3,000 souls have been stuffed into moria , a grim place of barbed wire and watchtowers . 
  through a fence muhammad , a syrian refugee , tells charlemagne of overcrowded shelters and a complete lack of information before a policeman cuts the conversation short . 
  pakistanis -- who , curiously , have been arriving in greater numbers since the deal kicked in -- have begun a hunger strike . 
  the ngos that used to provide services inside moria have partly withdrawn in protest , leaving it short of infrastructure , expertise and food . 
  last week amnesty international , a human-rights watchdog , criticised the `` appalling conditions '' at moria and another centre on the island of chios . 
  worse may be to come . 
  all migrants on the island have the right to claim asylum and to appeal if rejected , and 95 % have taken this up . 
  the greeks plan to conclude each case within just 15 days . 
  but there are endless unanswered questions over the process , from the treatment of unaccompanied minors to the provision of legal aid . 
  `` it 's an experiment for us , and for europe , '' says maria stavropoulou , the director of the greek asylum service . 
  very little about europe 's handling of the refugee crisis has gone right . 
  this deal is unlikely to be an exception . 
  refugees who have spent vast sums to flee life-threatening situations may not go willingly . 
  the fate of non-syrians returned to turkey is unclear . 
  legal challenges are certain . 
  the timeline for processing may well slip . 
  in the meantime , if arrivals pick up again , lesbos could reach its capacity of around 6,000 . 
  officials have already begun offloading migrants from moria to other camps . 
  dozens of eu asylum officials have been dispatched to process the claims . 
  ms stavropoulou 's service has doubled in number . 
  but she can not bring herself to say that she is confident the deal will work . 
  much of the criticism the deal has attracted is therefore deserved . 
  and yet , as yannis mouzalas , the greek migration minister , notes , by the time it was signed it was the best that could be done . 
  the eu had learned the hard way that it was unable to create a relocation scheme to share the refugee burden , and without one , fences were the only alternative . 
  for those european politicians whose priority was to reduce the flow , the new arrangement looks like a success . 
  new asylum registrations in germany fell to 21,000 in march , down from over 200,000 in november . 
  fears that migrants stranded in greece would find other ways through have not come to pass ; instead , they have camped out in wretched conditions near the border , and elsewhere , in the futile hope that it will reopen one day . 
  asylum or bust this has created a tinderbox in greece -- last week macedonian police tear-gassed migrants who tried to storm the border -- but breathing space for politicians . 
  not long ago pundits speculated that angela merkel , the german chancellor , might not see out her term . 
  now she enjoys rising approval ratings . 
  that could change if the deal collapses . 
  but there is a bigger concern . 
  there was , despite appearances , a noble idea behind the eu-turkey deal : stop the irregular migrant flows to make way for regular ones . 
  europe will probably make good on its minimal commitment to accept one syrian refugee from turkey for each one sent back from greece . 
  but the deal also includes a vague promise of far more substantial resettlements to europe : optimists have spoken of 200,000 a year or more . 
  on this there is little sign of movement , despite the efforts of german and dutch politicians to corral their colleagues into making pledges . 
  throughout this crisis europe has been accused of pulling up the drawbridge and shunting its problems onto its neighbours . 
  so far the accusation has not been warranted . 
  but it will be if the eu fails to make good on its resettlement promises . 
  on the wall of moria the graffiti is still visible behind the whitewash : `` eu shame on you . '' if europe does not show that its refugee policy amounts to more than border closures , detention and forced deportation , it will become impossible not to agree . 
  that the us is not in europe .
