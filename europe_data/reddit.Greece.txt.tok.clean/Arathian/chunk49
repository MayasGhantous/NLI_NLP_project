  [ full article here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/a57tex1.png ) full text : before reading a `` poem '' on german television on march 31st , jan b\u00f6hmermann , a satirist of questionable tact , explained that he wanted to clarify the boundaries of free-speech law . 
  he then declaimed a series of obviously fictional passages ( in rhyming verse ) depicting recep tayyip erdogan , the president of turkey , engrossed in a series of athletically challenging sexual activities with barnyard animals . 
  by the time the broadcaster took the video off its website a day later , it had caused a diplomatic fracas between turkey and germany . 
  the tension had been a long time brewing . 
  in 2007 the chancellor , angela merkel , snubbed mr erdogan by opposing turkish membership of the european union . 
  as mr erdogan 's rule became increasingly autocratic , mrs merkel often chided him for nobbling dissidents and the press . 
  but in 2015 refugees started streaming into the eu via turkey . 
  suddenly mrs merkel needed mr erdogan 's help . 
  the result is the deal that the eu , at mrs merkel 's prodding , made with turkey last month . 
  in return for taking back migrants from greece and cracking down on people-smugglers , turkey gets billions in aid and new talks about joining the eu . 
  its citizens will also be allowed to travel visa-free in europe . 
  mrs merkel is now reluctant to criticise mr erdogan . 
  basking in its new importance , turkey has summoned the german ambassador for a dressing-down three times in recent weeks . 
  one complaint was over a mildly satirical song about mr erdogan aired on german television on march 17th . 
  at that point mrs merkel declared press freedom sacrosanct -- prompting mr b\u00f6hmermann to up the ante . 
  on april 10th ankara dispatched a formal diplomatic note , invoking an antiquated german law against insulting foreign heads of state . 
  in theory mr b\u00f6hmermann could go to prison for three years , if the german government decides to prosecute . 
  amid howls of outrage in germany , mrs merkel has yet to rule this out . 
  mr erdogan has also filed a personal complaint on the same charges . 
  mrs merkel will need all her diplomatic skill to contain this spat . 
  the stakes are greater than mr erdogan 's fragile ego : freedom of speech , the refugee crisis and syrian policy are all in the mix . 
  meanwhile , another blow-up is on the horizon . 
  this spring the german bundestag is set to vote on whether the mass killings of armenians by turks a century ago constituted genocide . 
  expect turkish tempers to fray . 
  no witch hunting .

  i am not talking about naurgul this time , actually . 
  or at least , he is n't the main one . 
  had some guy who had even tagged me and every time i posted he would jump and say `` yada yada se exw taggarei yada yada kapitalistis yada '' . 
  ekane delete to account tou se kapia fash . 
  edit : an kai nai , o naurgul sigoura ekane post me agenda tote . 
  eeeeeeeeeh eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh after the 4th century , yeah . 
  before then , i would really struggle to claim that . 
  fact is , `` greek civilization '' was completely subdued ( along with mostly everything else ) by the roman-romans for a good 500ish years . 
  greeks during the `` byzantine '' times never identified as `` byzantines '' . 
  byzantium is a 19th century term and originally it only refered to the byzantium province ( basically , constantinople + east thrace ) . 
  back then , greeks identified as romans ( \u03c1\u03c9\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03af / \u03c1\u03c9\u03bc\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2 for example ) . 
  westerners , especially in the holy roman empire claimed the roman title for themselves , so they would instead use the name `` empire of the greeks '' .

  [ full article here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yibdz6e.png ) ** plain text : ** few people pondering how to vote in the referendum on britain 's european union membership on june 23rd will care which group is designated to vie for their support when the official campaign begins on april 15th . 
  yet the electoral commission 's decision on april 13th to pick vote leave from among rival pro-brexit organisations matters more than many realise . 
  official designation brings with it the right to spend up to # 7m ( $ 10m ) , to send a free mailshot to all households , to make a number of campaign broadcasts and to receive # 600,000 of taxpayer funds . 
  unofficial campaigners are far more restricted in what they are allowed to do . 
  brexiteers are already fuming because the government sent out its own leaflet this week advocating a vote to remain , at a cost to taxpayers of over # 9m . 
  ( the government says it is merely following the examples of the scottish referendum campaign in 2014 and the 1975 referendum on europe . ), 
  what counts most , however , is the people putting across the message and how they do it . 
  vote leave includes such heavyweight tories as lord ( nigel ) lawson , michael gove and boris johnson , as well as the uk independence party 's only mp , douglas carswell . 
  it was deemed by the electoral commission to have broader cross-party support than its main rival , grassroots out , which relied heavily on ukip 's leader , nigel farage and the financial backing of arron banks , a wealthy businessman . 
  more to the point , vote leave has been trying to make a liberal case for brexit , with a focus on less regulation and freer trade . 
  grassroots out and mr farage have instead put more emphasis on tougher immigration controls . 
  both groups recognise that concerns about immigration are the strongest source of support for brexit . 
  but vote leave is offering a more positive message and worries that relying on mr farage 's to argue for brexit might put off centrist and undecided voters . 
  because vote leave seems more sensible than its rival , its official designation may marginally boost the chances of a brexit vote . 
  the two groups will presumably now come together anyway . 
  mr farage has already congratulated vote leave and promised to work with it , as have two tory mps who helped to establish grassroots out . 
  but mr banks and some of his advisers are talking of a judicial challenge to the electoral commission 's decision . 
  if they can get a challenge off the ground , which seems unlikely , they could even delay the date of the referendum by a few months . 
  in the fuss over which pro-brexit group would be designated , less attention has been paid to the group selected to campaign to remain in the ( eu ) . 
  britain stronger in europe , led by lord ( stuart ) rose , the former boss of marks & spencer , has no rivals , is well financed and has the backing not just of leading pro-europeans but also of most british businesses . 
  yet even its fans concede that , by focusing largely on the risks to jobs and the economy from brexit , it is offering voters a less exciting vision than the brexiteers are . 
  as our new interactive poll tracker , which will be up on the site friday april 15th , shows the battle will be an extremely close-run thing . 
  / r/greece it 's ... eh ... 
  it 's okey . 
  it 's better than it was . 
  used to be very small and dominated by an ultra-loud minority of users that would shout out anyone that questioned their agenda pushing . 
  after the summer 's events , we got a huge influx of greek users so that subsided ( plus the leader of that gang ragequit ) .
