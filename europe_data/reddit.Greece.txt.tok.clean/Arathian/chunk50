  do n't have a problem with opposing views ( and god knows , almost nobody agrees with me for 99 % of the things in the sub ) but it was just depressing to post a comment and then going through an inquisition of the same 5 users yelling at you . 
  i do check it occasionally . 
  i rarely post in it .

  why is n't it bohemia ? 
  bohemia was a damn cool kingdom . 
  linking to another subreddit directly to follow a link to a dubious youtube video that is already labeled misleading is not acceptable,

  borderline but not crossing the line . 
  telling you that you are being rediculus is not insult . 
  which telling the other user to eat a dick clearly is .

  yes . 
  do n't do personal attacks . 
  since i do n't have time to read the whole thing and both of you are yelling at each other in anger and you are also being borderline racist : both of you stop . 
  this is a warning to both / u/khazarkhaganate but a warning to especially you . 
  you have been tagged for hatespeech before . 
  this is a final warning before a ban . 
  no personal attacks .

  it 's more meant for proffesional stuff . 
  when i saw it was n't that , i allowed it . 
  still , tagging it is good . 
  hmm , i checked and you seem to post in / r/europe often , so i 'll allow it . 
  i will tag it as your video though . 
  no self-promotion allowed , sorry,

  it already is the sacrificial sheep unfortunately . 
  do it !, 
  the community could use the money for sure  as for me , i got a house there . 
  it 's my family 's house and it 's hundreds of years old . 
  no , this is n't on the eu 's shoulder . 
  these are old immigrants . 
  this fault is in the failed multiculturalism policy from the 90s to the mid 2000s that failed to properly integrate , or even more fundamentally , vet immigrants coming to europe . 
  this is actually quite a cool idea . 
  yep !, 
  easy mistake to make . 
  lolnope it 's up in zagoria and it is one of the smallest ones . 
  [ this ] ( https://kapesovo.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/img_0529.jpg ) is the village square , and even that the people living there ( 10ish , 100ish in the summer ) think is too modern . 
  this is stunning . 
  man , these pictures remind me of my village . 
  i have n't seen it in years ... 
  if i visit this year going back to greece , i 'll take a load of pictures for reddit . 
  rt is most assuredly not allowed . 
  no idea how this slipped through . 
  goodbye, 
  the source is low quality , not the story . 
   what joke you are . 
  and i would suggest against insulting moderators .

  well ... unfortunately it can . 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_macedonia ) is a bit more detail on what i mean by `` threat to territorial integrity '' . 
  despite an agreement fyrom had with us  the united macedonia concept is still found among official sources in the republic , and taught in schools through school textbooks and through other governmental publications . 
  because their false narrative is directly threatening our history , territorial integrity and our dignity as heirs to a certain legacy . 
  we had a huge thread on the matter recently .
