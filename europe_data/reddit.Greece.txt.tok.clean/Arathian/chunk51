  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4aimwr/fyrom_or_macedonia/d10tma0 ) is the best response from the greek perspective in my opinion . 
  i can only offer that one since i am greek and firmly believe we are in the right . 
  you are greatly mistaken if you think the naming dispute is going to go away or that it wo n't be an instant veto from greece . 
  in both countries , ceding an inch further is political suicide and that is not changing any time soon . 
  why is it wrong ? 
  i see nothing wrong with it . 
  i also use other people when i feel like having a quick subway sandwich . 
  my mention to the 12th century was due to the * fact * that in the 12th century , european society at large thought it proper and moral to intervene between adult relationships if they deemed it immoral . 
  for example , bans on sodomy and homosexual acts , bans on non-missionary sex which were rather widespread and frequent , restriction of pre-marital sex and so on . 
  this stemmed from the idea that certain people held positions of moral correctness in what they believed ( mostly religion ) so they felt justified in impossing it to the rest of society . 
  that 's what i referred to . 
  nothing to do with < current year  . 
  i just pointed out that this type of argument is archaic and unworthy of consideration nowadays , similar to how , for example , suggesting an earth centered solar model would be archaic . 
  ok my argument has nothing to do with legal position of prostitutes in the 12th century though . 
  nope :( i. . . would n't know personally . 
  of course . 
  er ... so , from what you gather , you are offended by my suggestion that the 12th century had kind of regressive views on prostitutes and privacy in sex lives ? 
  what 's wrong with people wanting a quick bj ? 
  what the fuck are you on about . 
   you should be doubly ashamed as a greek : one of your most famous empresses of the middle ages was a fucking prostitute . 
  i literally just fucking said prostitution should be legal . 
  so uh , let 's say you have 100 members of parliaments . 
  to form a government , you would need 51 ( a majority ) . 
  if say , the biggest party got 40 % of the vote and has 40 mps , they need 11 more to form a government . 
  so they could ally themselves ( form a coalition ) with a party than has 6 % of the vote ( 6 mps ) and another that has 5 % ( 5 mps ) for a total of 51 % mps . 
  coalitions basically mean that the smaller parties will have some say in the government and could potentially get some minister position . 
  in return , they pledge to support government policy . 
  for example , in my country greece , the junior coalition member of the syriza government , independent greeks , have their leader as the minister of defense . 
  it also means they shackle the government to an extend because if the government goes full retard , the coalition members can just leave , removing the government majority and forcing snap elections . 
  i for one , am happy with that . 
  for all i disagree with the pirates about ( and it 's a shitton ) , at least they are staunch defenders of free speech and internet rights . 
  maybe their government will create a hub for dissidents in the world stage and encourage snowdens . 
  it specifically addresses the study you linked ... and many others too . 
  right , instead of going back and forward without any point , please read it and then we can talk further . 
   did you read the article i linked at all ? 
  it mentions examples from the whole world , not just the us . 
  prostitution is illegal when they made every single activity around prostitution illegal . 
  the difference is that the sex workers are not arrested . 
   hitting consumption is the best solution when the offer is about exploitation . 
  but the offer is not about exploitation . 
  the offer is a deal between two consenting adults . 
  there is nothing exploitational about that . 
   you claim something , you show me proof my friend . 
  that 's how it works . 
  burden of proof . 
  i did though . 
   well aint that a bummer . 
  no it 's not because that specific study is completely debunked . 
  did you read the article i linked at all ? 
  it mentions examples from the whole world , not just the us . 
  that ... makes prostitution illegal . 
  they are doing the swedish model . 
  obviously no sane bussiness could operate when the clients are criminalized . 
  i have no idea about the french statistics , but the statistics from first world countries i have checked in the past ( britain , australia , netherlands , germany ) all show a very low rate of coerced sex workers . 
  unless france has a serious and obvious endemic problem , i fail to see why it would diverge from the other countries significantly . 
  if you have any evidence to the contrary , i would be glad to see it . 
  at any rate , you are not answering any of my points right now . 
  if your sole objection is my lack of statistics , i 'll spend some time to satisfy you . 
   well that settles it guys . 
  well , yes it does . 
  if your argument is `` there is exploitation therefore it should be banned '' , then literally the majority of the things we allow , from driving to factories , should not be allowed because there can be exploitation in them . 
   sauce ? 
  [ here you go ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/03/27/lies-damned-lies-and-sex-work-statistics/ ) for an article on the subject . 
  the statistics validating what i said are everywhere . 
  the big majority of sex workers are not coerced . 
  even the most agenda pushing statistics support that claim . 
   so many are coerced . 
  but they are n't many , they are quite few . 
  and exploitation is everywhere . 
  there are people working in , for example , storage facilities that are illegal immigrants and work 12 + hours a day for almost no pay . 
  but if i told you the logical response is to ban storage facilities , you would call me insane , rightfully so . 
  the correct response is to properly regulate it to make sure such abuses do n't happen . 
  prostitution happens regardless of whether its banned or not . 
  the only thing that banning it does is dramatically increase the instances of abuse .

  making prostitution illegal is a terrible idea , both for the sex workers and the people . 
  first of all , regulated prostitution is completely victimless . 
  it 's just like any other transaction , just it is about sex . 
  the problems highlighted are either : a ) moralistic , which as far as i am concerned are not even worth responding to because this is n't the fucking 12th century and people can do whatever the fuck they want in their bedroom without some nosy assholes interfering . 
  this is serious , but the reality is that the vast majority of sex workers in the west do it by their own free will . 
  yes , technically , they were nudged in that direction because of the pay and whatnot and if it was illegal , they probably would n't do it , but they would n't do it because it would be underground and thus * far more dangerous * . 
  for the cases of exploitation ( sex slavery especially ) laws should toughen and the trade should be strictly regulated to make sure this does n't happen . 
  making it illegal is a huge step backwards in my opinion . 
  no personal attacks . 
  this is a warning . 
  he still misses april first :p ca n't blame him , i do too .

  ap is more defined as someone consistently trying to grandstand on specific issues . 
  for example , in an unrelated thread to islam , someone going ` ha , this is very good .
