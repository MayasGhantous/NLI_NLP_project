  i bet this would n't happen if we were ruled by sharia law ! '' . 
  him offering his opinion on the situation ( regardless of whether or not i/anyone agrees with him ) is not that . 
  i also do n't think he went past the line into racism , considering he never mentioned race or religon in his post ( nor implied it , as far as i can tell ) . 
  in the end of the day , dumb arguments ( not saying his specific arguments are dumb ) have a right to stay as long as they are not malicious . 
  i removed most of the rest of the tree as it has devolved into shit throwing .

  full soviet next year tovarisch  honestly , it 's all in good humour .

  there we go . 
  it 's even better in the modmail . 
  they wrote us multiple `` cease and desist '' the best part is , before implement the css , we specifically asked their permission and they specifically said yes .

  correct me if i 'm wrong but does n't the quran include :  2:191 and slay them wherever ye find them , and drive them out of the places whence they drove you out , for persecution is worse than slaughter . 
  and fight not with them at the inviolable place of worship until they first attack you there , but if they attack you ( there ) then slay them . 
  such is the reward of disbelievers . 
   2:216 warfare is ordained for you , though it is hateful unto you ; but it may happen that ye hate a thing which is good for you , and it may happen that ye love a thing which is bad for you . 
  allah knoweth , ye know not . 
   4:74 let those fight in the way of allah who sell the life of this world for the other . 
  whoso fighteth in the way of allah , be he slain or be he victorious , on him we shall bestow a vast reward . 
  and so on and so forth . 
  unless i am really bad at reading these , these are all violent calls to warfare and jihad against the unbelievers . 
  and i could find many more of these .
