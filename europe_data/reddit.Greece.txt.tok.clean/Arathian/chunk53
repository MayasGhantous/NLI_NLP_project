  [ cheers !, 
  ] ( http://www.greek-islands.us/greek-food/ouzo-plomari/ouzo1.jpg ), 
  that 's a position to hold , i guess . 
  i disagree with it but not like my position is based on more objective grounds . 
  i guess it comes down to personal preference . 
  have a good day , 
  i mean ... eh ... i showed this to my coworker and he had a good laugh but i am not sure it is safe for everyone 's work . 
  but it 's a damn tree . 
  it 's fine if you want to remove it .

  it 's not a matter of dumbness . 
  it would just be controversial because tradition , it would n't have a concrete benefit and people have known the 25th of march as their national holidays their whole life . 
  it just would be upsetting an established pattern , really . 
  also  also , you 're quite pathetic try arguing without calling people children or pathetic . 
  neither are necessary and both are definitionally personal attacks . 
  if you were a newer user , you would be slapped with a week ban for these 2 . 
  it 's a national holiday . 
  there is no `` right and logical '' thing . 
  moving the holiday back a month will not make it better in any way , it will just confuse people and uproot tradition , neither of which are good things without a proper benefit .

   is n't it retarded celebrating on a non-accurate date because of convenience / religious customs ? 
  absolutely not , most dates are based on convenience/customs , why would national holidays be different ? 
  back when it was made , it was a better fit due to the religious implications , which did matter , and today it 's the date that everyone knows . 
  there is absolutely no point in changing it , secularism or not . 
  but a ) secularism is not law in greece , quite the opposite , actually b ) even if secularism * was * law in greece , the national holiday was decided during a time where the vast majority of the population were orthodox christians so it made sense . 
  honestly , if you want secularism , there are issues like church-state separation , church taxation , removing religious education and so on and so forth . 
  having the national holiday move by a couple of days to fit a holiday people were celebrating already is really down on my priority list .

  eh , is it really that bad to link the holiday to a traditional religious holiday ? 
  as far as i am concerned , it just helps add more jubilation in the day . 
  why even have an issue with it ? 
  anyway , i do n't like mousaka so i do n't even care :\\ ^ ),

  are n't you doing that right now ? 
  news that might interest refugees ( border situation , camps etc ) and weather . 
  the actual segment is [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-v07jcl3iko&amp;ab_channel=%ce%a1%ce%b1%ce%b3%ce%b4%ce%b1%ce%af%ce%b5%cf%82%ce%a0%ce%bf%ce%bb%ce%b9%cf%84%ce%b9%ce%ba%ce%ad%cf%82%ce%95%ce%be%ce%b5%ce%bb%ce%af%ce%be%ce%b5%ce%b9%cf%82 ) in arabic with greek subtitles . 
  for a bit of context : with refugees amassing in greece , our government decided to dedicate some time in the national tv ( think greece 's version of bbc prime ) to a news segment in arabic for refugees . 
  the tl ; dr of the article is that the segment caused mass reactions from people , hundreds of whom called ert to complain .
