  `` dar al harab , the non-muslim world '' actually [ dar al harab translates to house of war while dar al islam means house of islam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/divisions_of_the_world_in_islam ) i always wondered what the implications of that world meant to muslim arabs . 
  slavs came from the uralian mountains , like most people . 
  bulgarians , for example , before moving to today 's bulgaria , had a large empire in the steppes and were known as bulghars . 
  south slavs were imported from russia by byzantium in order to secure and reinforce the borders from hunnic attacks around the same period .

  what ? 
  turks look mostly like southern europeans . 
  nothing to do with their skin color . 
  or their religion for that matter considering many there are atheists . 
  it 's mostly to do with their geopolitical position . 
  you are indeed correct and i apologize . 
  i thought this was a thread i saw before but it seems i simply saw yours twice . 
  again , apologies . 
  it 's approved . 
  i do n't suggest sarcasm when a moderator warns you of personal attacks . 
  no personal attacks . 
  also , in general , you are overly aggressive with users . 
  tone it down , assume good faith . 
  as a greek guy who lives in canada the past few years ... the difference is massive . 
  the food is barely edible for me here . 
  only exception are steaks .

  use the title of the article you are submitting . 
  the subtitle of the article you are submitting right after the article title is acceptable too . 
  let 's say `` guy falls down '' - title `` are slippery stairs a danger ? '', 
  the thread could be named `` guy falls down '' or `` guy falls down . 
  are slippery stairs a danger ? '', 
  nothing else without either removal or an editiorialization tag . 
  yes as long as the title is translated accurately . 
  this source is fine too !,

  i like the brits :( although english tourists need to learn to be a bit more respectful , yeah . 
  no personal attacks please . 
  if you see someone break the rules , please report them . 
  see , i heard that before so i did my own research . 
  all the information i could find is that , while pkk did recruit in turkey to fight in syria , they never directly fought the turkish millitary until erdogan ordered sweeps and multiple arrests in kurdish areas in turkey . 
  that escalated with the direct turkish intervention in syria and the bombings . 
  he directly started bombing pkk and entered a war situation with them . 
  the bombings are a response to that . 
  pkk is fighting for survival right now with both isis , the syrian army and turkey attacking them . 
  they hope these attacks will make turkey try to re-establish the truce . 
  they did and consequentially , there was an almost 10 year long truce where almost no violence took place . 
  then erdogan needed to take votes away from the kurdish party last elections so suddenly the truce was broken . 
  this is a direct consequence of that and turkish intervention in syria . 
  please use / r/askeurope,
