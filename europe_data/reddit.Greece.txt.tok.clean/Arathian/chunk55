  it 's certainly an interesting historical argument !, 
  no personal attacks . 
  report comments you think are breaking the rules . 
  please use / r/askeurope, 
   but it 's just relabeled/modified ottoman culture . 
  that 's wrong though . 
  our cultures , while they share some similarities , are vastly different . 
  nation states have a purpose and just uniting because `` power projection '' is a very poor argument and will inevitably lead to wars like the yugoslavian ones . 
  i get you think you are being hip by saying this stuff but you are n't . 
  it 's just embarassing to hear it . 
  you honestly do n't understand how deep the differences are until you go live in these countries for a couple of years . 
  politics fluctuate . 
  yeah , you alone under the current climate would never invade greece to `` reconquer '' macedonia but 100-200 years down the line nobody knows what will happen . 
  preventing you from laying a firm claim on us using falsified history is very basic national defense on a diplomatic scale . 
  i am sorry for this dispute and i wish it was just the name so we could literally solve it tomorrow , but it 's not and until it is , it 's in every greek 's self-interest to never accept your name . 
  actually ... there were several mass genocides in the early 800s which displaced the populations . 
  the early paionian populations were actually moved during the roman times , so even before the coming of the slavs ( who also again displaced the locals ) . 
  `` wanting to protect your history makes you a filthy nationalist , why do n't you let these nice macedonians claim your history and half your country in order for them to do their nation-building ? '', 
  sure it does when they also claim the rest of the baggage along with it . 
  they are not just claiming the name , they claim the whole lot , history , geography and so on . 
  in greek , we mostly just refer it as skopje ( after the capital ) . 
  do n't you think we have a right to perceive those politics as hostile and threatening to our territorial integrity ? 
  that 's the perfect response . 
  i would like to add it goes further than just a history disupute too . 
  the government of fyrom is using their historical claims to then push a nationalist agenda directly threatening greece 's territory . 
  they claim a significant `` macedonian minority '' in greece , they use maps claiming greek lands all the way to southern thrace ( essentially half of mainland greece ... ) and so on . 
  the naming dispute is only the surface of the argument but an important surface . 
  we simply ca n't afford to give ground to it while the other disputes are happening . 
  so it 's fyrom , not macedonia until then .
