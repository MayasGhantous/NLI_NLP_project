  we can not change the title of the thread which is why using the original title is so important . 
  i did n't remove it but you did change the actual title when you added the part after `` immigration affects school performance '' . 
  we are talking about it now , gimmie a minute . 
  edit : it 's back up after i talked with a more senior mod than me . 
  that does n't mean it will stay up 100 % , keep in mind . 
  please , for the love of god in the future , do n't change the blimey title at all . 
  title + subtitle at the most . 
  yay we have a purpose again !, 
  constantinople here we come , 
  aye but he changed the actual title of the article . 
  had a guy pm me to confirm . 
  editorialization does n't mean false information ( we would completely remove the thread for that ) . 
  it just means altering the thread 's name from the original article name . 
  yes . 
  dishonest is ok too . 
  the previous version was not . 
  edit : to clarify . 
  the basic idea is : is what you are saying attacking the * person * or the * validity of his arguments ? 
  '' * calling someone 's claims dishonest attacks his claims . 
  calling someone a `` fuckface '' or similar just attacks him .

  re-approved the comment chain . 
  disapproving what someone else said is fine . 
  going down to petty insults will just get people banned . 
  tone it down . 
  it 's not a given , it 's never a given . 
  again , i would like some confirmation . 
  i do n't like witch hunts . 
  can someone else confirm ? 
  if yes , i will add the editorialized tag . 
  ( i approved it . 
  ca n't speak a lick of swedish ) .

  hey guys , bad news : i wo n't be able to attend this session any more . 
  just had a long talk with some people at work and i will basically have some extra responsibilities for the next month or so on saturdays ( starting today ) . 
  it was an optional thing but i accepted ( for good reasons ) . 
  that means that muscowy is free for anyone to pick . 
  do me proud and create a glorious russia !,
