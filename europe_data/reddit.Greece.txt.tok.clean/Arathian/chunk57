  i actually made a post a year and a half-ish ago about exactly this . 
  i dug it up . 
  [ here is the full subthread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ddrww/holy_war_of_isis_arrives_in_germany/cjornuf ) my comment to someone asking why i think multiculturalism objectively failed : `` first off , diversity is an acceptance of mass immigration without a particular pressure to immigrants to assimilate or change their culture within the host country and instead a pressure to locals to accept said cultures . 
  tell me if you disagree with this definition so we can speak from a common ground . 
  now , the objective failures : - it brought over the worst qualities of the other countries along with the good ones and did nothing to pan them out . 
  this is in stark contrast with other immigration models like the american melting pot . 
  this thread is a good case in point of this . 
  - it created strong cultural tensions and locals are not the only ones to blame . 
  the immigrants themselves are not interested in interacting with the locals because most of them come from cultures that do n't pressure them into acceptance . 
  since the policy , by definition , does n't try to change it , it remains that way . 
  - strong cultural tensions brought strong cultural backlash . 
  this is a failure of policy . 
  if a policy brings on such a strong backlash something is done wrong , regardless if you agree or disagree with the backlash . 
  - it increased crime . 
  yes it did . 
  you might say it is the fault of the locals for not accommodating immigrants but it still did . 
  sweden is the rape capital of the world and it is n't swedes that are doing the raping . 
  - it distorted local cultures . 
  i left this for last because it is n't exactly an objective one since many do n't actually care about it , but i do . 
  so this is a failure for me . 
  many smaller cultures within the countries got homogenized the past 2 decades in a push of grand cultural change by the governments of europe and that is a loss . 
  edit , also a particularly bad one i forgot : - mass immigration was not controlled in any way for most of the past decade which led to a vast increase of unskilled labour that severely saturated the low skill labour market with no corresponding increase in low skill labour availability . 
  this led to severe lowing of wages , and even unemployment , of the poorer strata of locals as well as a deterioration of lifestyle . '', 
  as far as i am concerned , my comment still stands and , if anything , it is stronger today . 
  it 's such a classic trap man . 
  20 years ago in turkey , there was a useless , unused law about criticising the president that nobody remembered to abolish . 
  today thousands are arrested for it . 
  you should never give the government a right you would not find an acceptable loss for them to abuse because , inevitably , it will happen at some point and i honestly ca n't think of anything worse than an unelected official throwing out elected meps from the parliament . 
  please use / r/askeurope !, 
   there are rules i am obviously aware there are rules . 
  i do n't think schulz would have thrown them out without invoking rules . 
  my post never stated that what schulz did was illegal . 
  my post stated that the rule being there is * wrong * . 
   you appear to have misunderstood what freedom of speech is supposed to be . 
  freedom of speech for mps in parliaments is perhaps the most fundamental and absolutely core free speech there should be . 
  without mps being free to say what they want to in parliament , there simply ca n't be a democracy . 
  even in bismarck 's germany mp speech was considered free speech and you could quote it anywhere without being arrested ( something often used by socialists ) . 
  today they are censoring ( because that 's what it is ) gd fascists . 
  tomorrow , they could use the same procedures to censor opposition to economic changes , euroscepticism , socialism ideas , right wing ideas and so on and so forth . 
  once you put restrictions on what mps can say , you essentially jeopardize democracy at its core . 
  people should be thrown to jail for crimes they have commited after a fair trial . 
  that 's how democracies work and why they are better than fascist dictatorships . 
  mps should have an absolute and completely unrestricted right to free speech when in parliaments . 
  that 's a core of democracy and it is why they are better than fascist dictatorships . 
  if we did what you say , throw people in jail without a fair trial , deny them free speech and so on , we would be no better than golden dawn . 
  freedom of speech and ideas is important , including retarded ideas like his . 
  he is an elected mp . 
  throwing him out should n't be a thing .
