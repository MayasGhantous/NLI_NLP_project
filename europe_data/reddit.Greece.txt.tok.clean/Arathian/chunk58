  cheers man , the whole mod team will be happy to answer you ( and everyone else who posts there ! ) . 
  curiocity killed the cat as they say :p but really , it 's not as simple . 
  leaving that kind of comments up will invite brigades as i explained above . 
  nope . 
  also reports are user generated . 
  it 's why it is super important you all report stuff that break rules !, 
  for example , my above post was reported for  1 : shut up greek bitch are n't you bankrupt anyways ? 
  you probably have sex with strangers for a sandwich it really hurt my feelings :\\ ^ ) although , to be honest , if somebody is posting in a white supremacist subreddit regularly and posts here barely contained racism we will be less inclined to believe that he is sorry than a guy who made a crude joke and got caught with a ban . 
  you know , common sense stuff . 
  see , here is the problem , it wo n't be downvoted . 
  the moment we leave them up and say `` well , the community will decide ! '', 
  is when the community will be inevitably brigaded to push certain viewpoints . 
  i maintain for a long time that / r/europe 's brigade problem is n't as big as some people think but that is because we dilligently keep stopping comments from being directly racist or extremist ( on all sides , if i may add , not just far right ) . 
  the moment that was n't the case , you would see the usual stuff : / pol / brigades , stormfront ( or / r/european ) messaging each other about upvoting `` red pilling '' comments and so on and so forth . 
  and not to target just one side , people from other extremist groups would probably do the same . 
  by cropping the worst , we essentially help the community to not devolve into a battlefield where extremist sides try to win an internet war . 
  as you said , and i agree , `` fuck the arabs kill all the immigrants for a pure white race europe '' - style comments is objectively worsening the subreddit . 
  leaving them will also inevitably turn the subreddit into a battlefield . 
  so why do it ? 
  why worsen the subreddit ? 
  freedom of speech * is * very important and i would personally be against , eg , banning / r/european or / r/socialism because they have a right to their speech . 
  but that does not mean they should have the right to shit in a good discussion forum like / r/europe because they have their agenda to push . 
  edit : i do think we should take this to / r/europemeta though . 
  there is a reason that sub exists . 
  for exactly these discussions !, 
  please use / r/askeurope !, 
  calling people nazis out of the blue qualifies as a personal attack . 
  if you think what he says is nearing neo-nazi material , report it or explain why without personal attacks . 
  i have already tagged you for personal attacks before . 
  stop doing personal attacks . 
  this is your official warning . 
  the name 's germany , jeez , this is n't / r/polandball . 
  i 'll allow this comment but for future reference , if you got a problem with the moderators , please use / r/europemeta . 
  you have not being warned before , so take this as the warning . 
  also , we are not censoring anything . 
  trust me when i say i am as appaled by these attacks and statements as you are , if not more so and i am fairly anti-immigration myself . 
  however , many deleted comments are on the `` dem arab animals need to be shot in the streets '' caliber . 
  do you think / r/europe would be better with those comments ? 
  yeah , i am removing this whole shitshow . 
  yeah , sorry , i am removing this . 
  rationalwiki is not acceptable the same way other extremist stuff with an obvious agenda are usually not allowed . 
  i would also remove ( although that would also be followed by a ban ) with someone seriously citing metapedia .

  hi , anyone reporting this : / r/europes is different to / r/european ( which is the far right subreddit ) . 
  / r/europes is , in fact , a far more left wing subreddit than / r/europe . 
  whether that is a good thing or not , i leave up to you but please stop reporting this post for promoting hate subreddits . 
  indeed . 
  france would have been a strong emperor and could have changed the balance dramatically . 
  haha , most people are , on purpose , voting weak ai duchies to be emperors to internally weaken the empire . 
  the empire declined extremely rapidly and is almost irrelevant already .

  i think that stems from the fact that kasidiaris ca n't speak english well at all . 
  i think he tried to translate from a greek word that would mean `` forbidden '' or `` not allowed '' ( but not in a legal sense ) . 
  in the end of the video , he mentions that `` you can do whatever you want , but not in here '' so he obviously does n't think it is against the law . 
  or maybe it 's just his inner retard coming out , irono . 
  the problem for most empires were rarely foreign invaders but rather civil war . 
  civil war just gave an opportunity for foreign invaders to intervene and take advantage of it . 
  even in the famous battle of manzikert where the byzantine army got crushed and turks took over anatolia , the main reason for the crushing defeat is that a big chunk of the army deserted because they were brought by rebellious dukes so the army was suddenly completely outmatched . 
  so basically , yes , technically troops were not as patriotic ( although that was n't really much of a concept back then ) but they were far more loyal to the state rather than any local people ( s ) meaning they were far less likely to rebel which was the primary concern . 
  from , you are right , my bad . 
  for example , the majority of the akrites in georgia were from albania and bulgaria while the majority of akrites in bulgaria and albania tended be from asia minor . 
  it 's not that expensive and goes on sale every week or so . 
  you only need the base game for it ( who should be like 5 euros or so ) and you get all the dlc the host has ( host has all the dlc ) . 
  game is bloody fantastic by the way . 
  really fun and would recommend jumping in , especially now that it is fresh !, 
  yep , this should have been resolved in the 90s but it never was . 
  today , a solution is absolutely impossible because both countries and their citizens perceive their positions as the correct ones ( and i am absolutely included here ) . 
  that 's pretty good but nah , dakarans got dis . 
  we had 40 people this time without even the slightest hitch . 
  we also had a bloody world war at some point with half of europe duking it out with the other half . 
  if he can survive that , he can survive anything !, 
  thank you very much for your offer though !, 
  it 's fine , we actually have 0 problems with the host !, 
  / u/dakarans is the host and the game goes completely smoothly . 
  the only problems that show are on an individual 's end ( bad internet/trash pc usually ) . 
  they were in a private building . 
  they are allowed legally to throw them out . 
  they did not arrest ( or involve the police ) against the reporters . 
  he simply cut off the interview ... 
  i am unsure what exactly is your point here . 
  ps : gd are a bunch of cunts , in case `` someone '' tries to twist what i am saying here ( not you berzelus ) . 
  yep !, 
  i am sure you have heard of akrites . 
  akrites were also resettled on purpose ~ ~ by ~ ~ from foreign lands so they would be more attached to the state than any locals . 
  it was a usual trick in the empires of the time .
