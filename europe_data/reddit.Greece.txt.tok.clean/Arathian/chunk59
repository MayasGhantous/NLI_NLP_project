  come on man , give us some credit . 
  we did good in world war 1 too !, 
  ... but really , do n't respond to obvious trolls . 
  russia stands by its allies !, 
  iberia ( outside of the southern tip ) never became majority islamic/andalusian though . 
  the strong majority were always christians and the north ( kingdom of leon ) was actually never conquered completely . 
  obviously , the reconquista involved even andalusia which was islamic , but for the most part , it was a reconquest . 
  please do n't do agenda pushing in unrelated threads . 
  they are !, 
  i have uploaded the savegame file already  check the pss of the op . 
  i seem to recall a very minor intervention by italy too :p,

  hah , france and spain got themselves into a bit of a jiffy . 
  they expanded way too aggressively so everyone got spooked . 
  when mainland england was invaded a huge coalition formed aiming to bring them down . 
  it 's savoy 's fault for breaking the italian club :p, 
  ** i invite everyone to write a small recap of his playthrough last time . 
  cookie bonus if you write it as the glorious leader of your nation ** the kingdom of muscowy : as the treacherous traders of novgorod defied the rightful rule of the rightful king of all the russias , we decided we had claims on their land to bring under our state . 
  unfortunately , the traders allied with the golden horde in the south . 
  barbarians and fearful traders together . 
  despite all that , muscowy prevailed until ... 
  under a pretender , sweden declared independence from denmark . 
  while the war in novgorod was raging , the muscovite king could not intervene . 
  yet when the war was won , he intervened . 
  novgorod , despite his loss , refused to surrender however and started a guerilla war . 
  with help of the now officially hostile swedes , they managed to retake the city of novgorod . 
  yet the war was not lost . 
  after multiple battles , the swedes were pushed back yet again and novgorod was retaken , finally destroying the novgorodian traders and limiting their influence to a bit of frozen tundra in the north and making most of their leaders flee to lithuania . 
  sweden completely won the war , getting its independence and danish land marking them as rivals of the russian nation . 
  the next 20 years were spend trying to rebuild the ruins and pay back the endless debts . 
  today , muscowy is united and its armies are back and the debts repaid . 
  the future awaits !, 
  glorious god ~ ~ damn ~ ~ praised italian union,

  ** full text for those without subscription to the economist ** greece 's migrant crisis is getting worse . 
  macedonia has closed its border to all but a trickle of migrants , following the example of austria and other countries along the so-called west balkans route to germany . 
  yet desperate syrians and iraqis continue to arrive at the idomeni crossing point . 
  on february 29th macedonian police used tear gas against scores of migrants trying to break down the border fence . 
  as the economist went to press , more than 12,000 people were crammed into a tent camp with facilities for only 1,500 . 
  food is in short supply . 
  `` it 's a tense situation , '' says panagiota siafaka , a social worker with the un high commission for refugees . 
  so long as the border remained open , greece could manage the flow of arrivals from turkey . 
  now almost 30,000 migrants are bottled up in greece . 
  nikos kotzias , the foreign minister , expects the number to reach 150,000 ; local aid agencies worry that 200,000 people may arrive in march alone . 
  reception centres around athens for migrants are hopelessly overcrowded . 
  half a dozen new ones , mostly refurbished former military camps , are quickly filling up . 
  local and international charities provide food and medical care . 
  `` the state seems absent , but luckily ordinary people are here every day to help , '' says mariana , a paediatrician working at piraeus port , gesturing towards a group of elderly greek women handing out bananas and chocolate bars to harassed mothers in headscarves . 
  things will improve , if only gradually . 
  greece expects to receive a large chunk of the eu 's new $ 700m ( $ 760m ) , three-year humanitarian aid package for countries that host a lot of migrants . 
  of that , $ 300m would be spent this year . 
  athens-based aid agencies hope that funds will bypass the slow-moving greek bureaucracy , going straight to needy migrants in the form of vouchers for food and housing . 
  but stemming the flow of migrants from turkey is proving hard . 
  a nato naval mission was due to begin monitoring the strait between greece and turkey on february 29th , electronically locating smugglers ' boats so turkish coastguards could nudge them back to shore . 
  but on march 2nd the nato vessels were still in port . 
  the greek defence ministry said turkey had raised `` technical problems '' . 
  eu leaders hope for a breakthrough at a summit on march 7th with ahmet davutoglu , turkey 's prime minister . 
  the turkish government has yet to crack down on the people-smugglers . 
  diplomats in athens believe the turks will make a deal conditional on eu countries resettling syrians from refugee camps in southern turkey . 
  meanwhile , turkey has agreed to take back economic migrants who crossed to the greek islands from turkey . 
  after weeks of bureaucratic exchanges between the greek and turkish police , a first group of 270 moroccans , tunisians and algerians were handed into turkish custody on march 2nd at the land border in thrace . 
  a group of 150 pakistanis will be next . 
  it is a modest start , yet even a small reduction in numbers helps relieve greece 's migrant burden .
