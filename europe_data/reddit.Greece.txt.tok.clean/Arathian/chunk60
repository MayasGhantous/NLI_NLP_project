   go fuck yourself ** no ** personal attacks consider that your only pre-ban warning . 
  this was reported . 
  anyone knows what it says ? 
  i am leaving it up for now . 
  yes it 's a conspiracy * wooooo * you can criticize people and cultures but racism is not allowed . 
  simple as that . 
  the glory of russia shall be channeled through me . 
  we remove non-unique , non-interesting local stories ( both crime and not ) . 
  if something is just part of a repeating pattern and not unique in any way ( f.ex . 
  a single rape in a capital ) then we generally remove it . 
  if something is either analysis or something pretty unique ( like this story ) we wo n't !, 
  hey , please do the opposite . 
  post the article in the op and the youtube video in the comments and i will approve of the thread !,

  i feel you , but please do n't do personal attacks . 
  just report people like these and we will take care of them . 
   hm an american who is posting cluelessly in an european sub what ? 
   while he has left his own countrymen in the shit . 
  crabs in a bucket is not a valid argument either lad . 
  edit :  some history oh , you are adorable . 
  you have no comeback so you stalk someone 's history ? 
  i bet you are really dissapointed you did n't find some wrongthink sub to call me out on , right ? 
  please no low effort circlejerking mate . 
   ofc just letting one nation get destroyed is no problem for the nazis in this sub . 
  yes , it was the nazis that pushed for the quotas . 
  it was the nazis who opened the floodgates with the `` refugee welcome `` s . it was the nazis who wanted the immigrants to come . 
  come on , who are you kidding mate ? 
   the destruction of the eu is the dream of the right wing nationalists here yes it is because the eu is the source of a ton of problems . 
  just calling someone a `` nationalist '' does n't make him wrong . 
  no personal attacks please !, 
  the ones with enough landmass and infastructure that would make them elligible for a refugee camp all are .
