   many of these people belong to opposition groups so how could we make them feel safe on assad controlled terrain ? 
  because it would be explicitly neutral and assad would have no power over it . 
  granted , maybe assad would try to intercept them on the way to the camp but we can deal with that . 
  assad needs us to not fuck him over , after all . 
  he is starting to win and knows he ca n't afford to do funny stuff . 
  it 's not as bad as you might think . 
  most of the coastal regions are already strictly under assad 's rule and fairly stable . 
  most of the fighting is now on the eastern and southern regions . 
  i doubt assad would seriously object to such a plan either . 
  the camp would need a basic security , of course , but nothing too special . 
  we have made such camps near warzones in the past . 
  there is a reason i brought up the african un camps . 
  several reasons : 1 ) because we would deport all we find anywhere in europe to these camps instead of having them stay around looking awkward . 
  2 ) because the only way one could legally live in europe would be through application in one of these camps . 
  3 ) because the camps would be okey at providing basic needs so people in immediate danger could flee there for safety . 
   these people want to northern europe because of financial gain , not because of security . 
  but it 's impossible for them to get to n. europe without being found first . 
  if the camps existed , our main concern ( where do we put those people ? ), 
  would be solved . 
  please check my [ response ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/47isyv/alexis_tsipras_greece_must_not_become_a_human/d0dfsra ) to the norwegian fellow i made a few minutes ago for the answer !, 
  that is unlikely to happen . 
  first of all , real refugees are still technically accepted up north and with the mess that the administration is nowadays , who is and who is n't a real refugee is pretty hard to find out . 
  not to mention smuglers will still lie to these people that europe is waiting for them in open arms . 
  merkel 's `` refugees welcome ! '', 
  skit will be played over and over again until it stops making them money .

   what does that tell us about greece ? 
  that greece does n't like having its history stolen ? 
   perhaps this is a good time for macedonia to get back at greece ? 
  in what way ? 
  will they name another road `` alexander '' ? 
  would you be okey if large swathes of finland became refugee camps ? 
  also , currently , europe is not helping greece in any way that can be deemed sufficient . 
  assuming 1m refugees next year ( which is a low estimate ) that would be 100 euros for a whole year/immigrant .

  i have always been a proponent of the eu creating ( funded by all nations in europe ) large `` refugee camps '' in syria and libya , moddeled after the successful un camps in africa . 
  these would accept all people and provide basic and sanitary living conditions and security for anyone in need . 
  from there , people could put their applications and , once accepted , shipped to the eu nation that accepted them . 
  that way it 's both more organized and no nation has to wrangle all the balls . 
  it would also be cheaper in the long term considering economies of scale would apply to those camps !, 
  not to mention it could finally bring some stability to regions of libya and syria . 
  would n't the better option be to make sure we can properly filter immigrants before reaching the eu in the first place ? 
  i am kinda bewildered over why that 's not considered as an option . 
  our islands are n't human storages either . 
  they have people living in them . 
  it would be like saying `` oh , it 's fine , we do n't ask all of norway to become a refugee camp , just a couple of regions '' . 
  would that be acceptable to you ? 
  hey mate , please tone down the personal attacks .
