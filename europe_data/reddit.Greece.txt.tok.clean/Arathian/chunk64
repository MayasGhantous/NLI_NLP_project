  i do n't think using 1984 in the op is absurd even if it is purposefully hyperbolic . 
  there we go . 
  if you object to any of the above i 'll answer tomorrow morning because i now seriously need to sleep . 
  no , what i am saying is censoring information that were previously publicly available ( for example , in the form of a news story in a news network ) is bad because it is an overeach of the government into dangerous territory . 
  free speech is a fundamental right and that is an errosion of it . 
  the government is simply a tool of the state . 
  i apologize for my misuse of the term `` government '' . 
  change that to `` the state '' . 
  the state is censoring and the government simply passes the laws the state then enforces via the courts and police , for example . 
  so i was wrong in the term but i fail to see how i am wrong in the substance . 
  thank you . 
  have a wonderful day/evening/god knows what i have lost track of time . 
   you clearly do n't accept that me , as a private person , have a valid interest in not having my name/address readily available in a search engine you are unaware of what the right to be forgotten is then . 
  using wikipedia again for convenience :  the right to be forgotten `` reflects the claim of an individual to have certain data deleted so that third persons can no longer trace them . '', 
  ** it has been defined as `` the right to silence on past events in life that are no longer occurring . 
  ** this is n't about just censoring where you live . 
  this can censor ( and has been used to censor ) such stuff as news stories about your past run-ins with the law , past information , embarassing photos ( not just revenge porn ) etc in fact , the very first case of the law on a european scale was a spanish guy who had his house auctioned and did n't want the story to get out . 
  you , as a private person , have an interest to eg bury the fact that you are a convicted pedophile but the public also have an interest to know what you did if you become our new neighbour . 
   but then you go on to assert that this has something to do with censorship . 
  because it absolutely is and whether or not you have an interest in the censorship is absolutely irrelevant . 
   i ca n't even . 
  if you ca n't even , downvote with the rest and move on . 
  i dislike useless replies to my comments . 
  absolutely . 
  one of the acceptable forms , along with , for example , censoring direct threats of violence or pornography in public view . 
  censorship is any suppression of information by the government . 
  that does n't mean that censorship is 100 % of the time bad or unacceptable . 
  i do think it is when it is censoring non-illegal and non-harmful information . 
  i would love to hear why you think my opinion is wrong . 
   it 's about the law being set so that an individual citizen of ordinary status can request something to be removed , which is the novel aspect of this . 
  but that 's simply untrue . 
  there are already laws that can allow individuals to requestion deletions or protect information . 
  the whole damn patent system , for example , is exactly that . 
  if you spread patented information , you would be liable under the law . 
  there is nothing novel about that . 
  or if you want a different example , an individual can request data protection to make his private address and information ( phone number , mail address etc ) private . 
  the only novel thing about this law is that the concept of government censorship has expanded to non-illegal material ( such as news stories or reports ) which is what makes it unacceptable . 
   when in fact its privately enforced . 
  but that 's wrong . 
  it is not privately enforced . 
  if google refused to comply , the government could potentially fine google or even escalate further and forbid google from conducting bussiness within the eu ( at least ) . 
  that 's definitionally not `` privately enforced '' . 
  it just seems that you have the misconceptions . 
  could you tell me why that would be ? 
  in any case , i really doubt that . 
   you 're being sarcastic and patronising in both your comments which i find unnecessary . 
  i was not being sarcastic at any point . 
  nor patronizing , i would like to think . 
  i am just pointing out the facts . 
   as you said , the individual wants something deleted , not the government . 
  just because the government is acting on behalf and for the benefit of the individual does not make it `` government censorship '' . 
  you highlighted government in your sentence as if having the word in there makes it so . 
  the government enforces the law to delete information . 
  that automatically makes it government censorship since compliance is obligatory under law . 
  the point of highlighting the government was to show the enforcer of said law . 
  the fact that a private individual requested the government to censor something ( which happens often , i might add ) does not make the government 's actions not-censorship magically . 
   the censorship aspect of this can be argued for , but it 's certainly not `` textbook '' as no such law or situation has existed before . 
  it is textbook censorship since the government is actively censoring information . 
  the law being new is quite irrelevant to that . 
  if the government introduced a law dictating that you can never talk about ducks , that law would also be textbook censorship despite the law being a new one . 
   there are arguments that can be made on either side , i do n't understand the conviction some have on how this is some big government conspiracy somehow . 
  nobody here is talking about conspiracies . 
  i am just pointing out that this is a plain censorship law and i hate censorship laws . 
  i do n't think the government here is `` conspiring '' to do anything in particular . 
  conspiracy would imply a deeper plan which i doubt exists . 
  this law is just dumb , harmful and it is censorship . 
  and yes , it is big government infringing on the right to free speech . 
  will the report make the law stop being censorship ? 
   how is this government censorship . 
  it 's not even simply censorship , let alone by the government . 
  here is wikipedia 's definition of censorship :  censorship ** is the suppression of speech ** , public communication or other information which may be considered objectionable , harmful , sensitive , politically incorrect or inconvenient as determined by governments , media outlets , authorities or other groups or institutions . 
  so , with that in mind , let 's look at the [ right to be forgotten ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/right_to_be_forgotten ) under which these are deleted . 
  when an individual wants something to be deleted , he contracts the ** government ** who then ** forces ** google to delist information . 
  it is pretty much textbook censorship . 
  i honestly ca n't see how it is n't exactly that . 
  i would love your perspective on this . 
   the results/pages containing info about a person are still out there , they just do n't show up in the google search . 
  so are under the great firewall of china . 
  nobody can delete the pages outside of very specific circumnstances ( physical police raids ) . 
  that is completely irrelevant on whether or not it is censorship . 
   also , this law has nothing to do with any government wanting to hide info from its citizens , but rather citizens wanting their info not easily accessible through a google search . 
  please . 
  the `` right to forget '' is fucking absurd and rediculus . 
  ~ ~ the most common users of the law are convicted pedophiles and that 's all you really need to say about it . ~ ~ edit : so people can stop correcting this point , it 's untrue . 
  pedophiles ( and other heavy offenders ) have used the law but they are by no means the majority . 
  read [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/45dhmg/so_i_was_searching_for_george_orwell/czx63fn ) comment for a bit more info on my point . 
  yes , the law wo n't cause government helicopters carrying soldiers with machine guns to appear outside our window for wrongthink but it absolutely is government censorship . 
  could n't we at the very least house him in a jail waiting trial on terrorism support ? 
  in case someone 's wondering , yes , all the big islands shown on the east of that island are , in fact , large islands populated by greeks and are part of greece ( even recognized by turkey ) . 
  so turkey claims ownership of an island smack in the middle of greece . 
  and that 's why we and turkey ca n't get along politically . 
  edit : [ this ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/167803/article/ekathimerini/news/greece-to-make-international-protest-over-turkey-reserving-aegean-air-space ) is not a new thing by the way . 
  turkey does that frequently . 
  last summer they tried to reserve [ this ] ( http://content-mcdn.imerisia.gr/filesystem/images/20150301/low/imerisia_large_t_1061_43994694.jpg ) whole damn thing for * 6 months * before we officially escalated to tell them `` no '' . 
  it 's just absurd that turkey considers these claims fair somehow . 
  it 's rare , sure . 
  and while it does occasionally snow , the snow rarely sticks or , if it does , is so thin that it might as well not exist . 
  i live in canada the past few years and there is a difference between meters deep snow that prevents movement and a small layer that could very well be grass as far as anyone 's concerned . 
  ordung must be maintained after all . 
   your land border with turkey is not a problem .
