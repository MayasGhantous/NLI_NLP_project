  your coastal border ... well , we 're seeing it . 
  it 's not flat , it 's technically deep . 
  and also not snowy  it does n't snow near sea . 
   what about the border with macedonia ? 
  is it `` passable '' easily in the winter ? 
  our border with fyrom * is pretty passable . 
  basically , our biggest mountain range is pindus that starts from northern albania all the way down to western thessaly . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.in2greece.com/english/maps/map_of_ancient_greece.jpg ) is a geographical map of greece . 
  that 's because epirus is full of mountains that can go thousands of km high . 
  on the other hand , our borders with turkey ( from where the immigrants come ) is mostly flat swampland . 
  in the cold winter , at worst , it simply freezes over which actually makes travelling a bit easier as you do n't sink as much ( although it is more dangerous ) . 
  greece does n't have snow just so you know . 
  winter is just 0-10 degrees with the occasional downpour . 
  that 's the problem with limiting free speech . 
  you might think `` hate speech '' is not free speech but the only one who will define what is and what is n't hate speech is the government . 
  today the government might tolerate you but tomorrow it might not . 
  in any case , as a conservative , i hope for a quick release and an apology to the puppeteers for putting them in a rediculus situation like this . 
   ku klux klan kkk in the us , right now , has less than 50 members . 
  it just does n't exist any more . 
   national christian party , iron guard . 
  literally who ? 
  it was n't an original brand . 
  we just had factories that made cars for volkswagen and others . 
   in order for that standardization to be implemented , we need a method to quickly and reliably pass legislation that applies in all member states . 
  there goes the absolute sovereignty of national parliaments . 
  i do n't think anyone argues for absolute national sovereignty . 
  this is n't the 1930 's . 
  however , you do n't need , eg , common border policies in order to properly trade or to establish common regulations . 
  and i dispute that we need any sort of political union for such market to exist . 
  ttip and ttp are a proof of that with the countries participating being sovereign countries that simply agree to a trade agreement ( if the agreement is positive or not is a different matter , of course ) . 
  er ... you misread what i wrote . 
  i said most people * that oppose the political union * do n't oppose free agreement . 
  that was a statement on the people who oppose the political union , not how many people oppose or support the union . 
  back in the 70s , the eu was proposed as a common market initiative with eventual statehood aspiration . 
  so the single market absolutely was before any politicial unions . 
  why ? 
  the single market was a successful project far before the european union was a thing . 
  in fact , it is n't the political and economic union that gave birth to the trade union but the other way around . 
  most people opposing the eu do n't oppose the free trade agreement ( if anything , i would basically want it to expand ) . 
  most of us oppose the political and monetary union . 
  so your comment is pretty strawman-y . 
  that was the case in greece in the 80s too , including the diversified economy ( we even made cars back then , believe it or not ) . 
  greece was not always banana republic-tier . 
  it begun slowly with a government becoming more inefficient and corrupt , the unions refusing to adjust to the new situations and then catastrophic mass social policies ( not just immigration , although it did play a role ) . 
  france is not doomed and it 's not greece yet but it has very clear signs of heading in that direction , as i said above . 
  it 's not meant to be catastrophology , just an observation about a country i really like and would be sad to see fail in the same ways my country did . 
  so were the greeks until the slow growth came to a halt and we imploded . 
  france is heading face first into a wall and it 's sad to watch it . 
  it is exactly the same as us . 
  one of the best in the world , especially when you consider the absolutely amazing vocals too . 
  my top anthem along with the soviet/russian anthem . 
  i am a bit of an anthems geek . 
  anyway , [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piqseq6tevs&amp;ab_channel=jamesblitz90 ) and [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3ivxo0w1yi&amp;ab_channel=michubulls ) are the vocal version of the anthem !, 
  vote vasileus , make byzantium great again !, 
  ach , did n't know that . 
  i thought you just had to buy something . 
  http://store.steampowered.com/app/291010/?snr=1_7_7_230_150_92 25 canadian cents . 
  edit : http://store.steampowered.com/app/438030/?snr=1_7_7_230_150_91 18 canadian cents . 
  oh ... that is a weird issue . 
  lem me google it . 
  edit : according to the internet , you need to buy a game for yourself . 
  that means if all you play is f2p and gifted games , you ca n't join . 
  if you ca n't buy any game ( there are games that cost literally 5 cents there ) just add me on the friend 's list and i will directly invite you . 
  never had a single hitch last session . 
  there are many things that can be ignored but there are barriers to that . 
  for example , when you break alliance , there is a 5 year cooldown before you can attack . 
  we do have other rules against `` gamey '' things too . 
  for example , if someone surrenders , you got ta give him a peace offer ( you ca n't keep him occupied forever ) or if you are fully defeated , you ca n't keep denying offers out of pure spite . 
  this would fall under the same category of fighting gamey behaviours . 
  of course , your opinion is valid and i do n't deny it . 
  i just do n't think such a rule is overly restrictive . 
  that 's okey . 
  india smells anyway :\\ ^ ), 
  as a reminder , we had a deal about the asia lands too . 
  regarding the spice islands specifically . 
  and spain and italy made an agreement about what 's whose . 
  spain intends to keep to the deal . 
  the kingdom of spain would like to extend the timeline with its own happenings : the spanish protectorate of mexico had a change in leadership with a leader that had absurb aspirations of independence . 
  his non-cooperation lead to increased tarrifs as punishment and ever increasing millitary security presence in mexico . 
  despite the repeat warning and the army assembled in mexico , the colonial governor actually openly defied the spanish emperor and declared independence . 
  obviously , with god in our side , we crushed the rebel and hung his body in the central square of mexico city . 
  we also had multiple wars in east africa . 
  the east africans even assisted the mexican traitor to rebel and are to be thoroughly punished for that behaviour . 
  as of today , spain is officially at war with malwa . 
  spain also expanded cooperation with its sometimes friend , sometimes enemy , hopefully now friend , france in colonial defence since his own colony of amerique is also rebelious . 
  the deal includes a deal of non-intervention and securing the colonies of the other . 
  that extends several diplomatic relations the emperor of spain had with the french king . 
  so what 's the point of ld if it can be freely ignored ? 
  just that one . 
  it would be unfair if , say , a nation with 10 % ld ( in case you are not an eu4 player , that means liberty desire . 
  if it is beneath 50 % , an ai nation will never act hostile to the liege nor declare independence ) would declare independence just because it is a player . 
  plenty , but mostly outside of europe . 
  most of the european nations have been either been absorbed by a big nation around it or is about to be . 
  outside of europe we have several large to medium sized nations waiting , including a zoroastrian persia !, 
  nope , sorry :( and actually a lot of stuff happened . 
  dakarans was busy this week . 
  edit : [ aar here !,

  why is portraying something in a stereotypical way a negative ? 
  notice how he never mentions * democracy * in this quote , he mentions * freedom * .
