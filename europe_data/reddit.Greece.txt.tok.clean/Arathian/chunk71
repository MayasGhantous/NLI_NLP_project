  who 's at war with iran . 
  who 's at war with north korea ? 
  are you or just pretending to be dense ? 
  war is terrible for all bussiness that is n't war bussiness . 
  and war 's not the only bussiness around . 
  you think a bank that has to block iran 's accounts profits ? 
  you think a construction company that ca n't build in n. korea makes more money ? 
  how exactly is war good for bussiness ? 
  you are confusing a few stuff . 
  wars reduce the total output of an area , they do n't resolve the crisis . 
  the difference is that victorious countries tend to be able to get the defeated country 's stuff which kind of fixes their problems , sometimes . 
  if that 's not the case , then the war generally turns a loss . 
  in the end , did usa end its economic problems with the iraq war ? 
  when countries enter into all-out war mode , they hugely pump out production at a massive deficit . 
  that 's both not sustainable and , in the long run , does more harm than good . 
  it can temporarily halt a crisis , but the end result is never a positive one . 
  war is bad for bussiness , bad for trade and bad for capitalism . 
  some segments profit but the system as a whole does not . 
  okey , it 's better than communism , it 's better than feudalism , what system is it not better than ? 
  space magic ? 
  capitalism is the best system we currently have . 
  as i said , it is * not * perfect , but if are going to decry it , better find an alternative . 
   unsustainable but that 's wrong . 
  there is nothing unsustainable in capitalism . 
   greed and greed is bad because ... ? 
  right ... 
  which is why the earth , after ditching feudalism and entering capitalism , is now worse off . 
  which is why poland , after ditching communism , is now worse off . 
  / s in case it is n't obvious . 
  capitalism is the best system we currently have by far . 
  it is flexible , not ideologically rigid and has consistently brought prosperity to countries that implemented it . 
  is it perfect ? 
  but saying no one but the rich have benefitted from capitalism is an utter lie and bullshit . 
  i did n't choose the country i was born into either , so i will petition my state to tax me according to bahamas tax standards while living in greece !, 
  eeeeeh , gentleman rules wo n't really happen with so many players . 
  i just urge people to think of this game as sp with the ai set to hard . 
  maybe agreements can be reached between players but there wo n't be a campaign rule to enforce them and , yes , backstabbing can ( and is allowed ) to happen . 
  update : i added everyone who added me on steam . 
  game starts in 1.5 hours from now !, 
  oh , you should be just fiiine then . 
  add me on steam if you have n't already . 
  ya man , of course . 
  not sure if your speed is enough , but join and see how it goes . 
  we will be going slowly anyway so it might be enough !, 
  nope . 
  i am eastern na but that * usually * does n't make a difference since lag is n't a factor in mp . 
  the only thing that really matters is the host to be able to distribute to all the players the information and the players to have a strong enough connection to receive it , else they might desynch . 
  also , i have 50 ** mb ** ps which is slightly better than yours :p, 
  he has like , a billion dollars dude . 
  rich people are all sophisticated without exception ^ ^ ^ :\\ ^ ), 
  yeah . 
  i have a powerful pc and a 50 mb connection + all the dlc so i will be a good host, 
  say it after me : *** president trump *** god is the whole ordeal amusing as an outsider . 
  none . 
  it 's not really heavier . 
  it just requires decent internet to not desynch . 
  if you have at least a couple mbps internet and can run sp fine , you should be good to go . 
  dankest eu4 meme is about fucking leo x and his fucking indulgences though . 
  this is a bit easier to understand :p, 
  only if you enable fantasy and , really , most `` advanced '' native nations are not reeeeally capable of invading europe . 
  they are not really strong enough for that . 
  but with , basically , starting western tech , they can resist the west much easier . 
  i would highly suggest trying a bit of the single player to get the basic idea at least though !, 
  else it 's simply going to be an * extremely * confusing experience . 
  yet what ? 
  is there any indication or hint of them going going nazi ? 
  actually , quite the opposite with them purging almost all extremist elements the past few years . 
  might as well say the pirate party or the socialists are not nazis `` yet '' . 
  sunset invasion is for ck2 , not eu4  eu4 does n't have any module that needs deactivating . 
  another greek that appreciates pmqs !, 
  * waves mao 's little red book *, 
  it was n't for soooo many reasons . 
  first of all , the question was a red herring . 
  the proposal the question refers had been withdrawn by the time the referendum happened . 
  so the entire question is invalid from the start . 
  second , nobody believed or pretended it was about accepting the proposal . 
  syriza barely mentioned it instead focusing on getting `` a better deal '' and `` renegotiations '' which we all know how that ended . 
  opposition said that a no meant greece getting kicked out of the eu . 
  basically , the vote was on anything but what the question actually asked . 
  [ right on comrade ] ( https://i.imgur.com/gy09pam.jpg ), 
  front nationale are not nazis though . 
  man , i opposed the eu and immigration all these years for free . 
  i should write to putin to receive my check too . 
   used for emphasis while not being literally true . 
  learn to read . 
  literally \u02c8l\u026at ( \u0259 ) r\u0259li / adverb in a literal manner or sense ; exactly . 
  `` the driver took it literally when asked to go straight over the roundabout '' synonyms : verbatim , word for word , line for line , letter for letter , to the letter ; informal ** used for emphasis while not being literally true . 
  ** `` i have received literally thousands of letters '' gaze and be amazed . 
  yes , and the socialists want to bring a revolution hurdur front nationale and nsdap have literally 0 things in common . 
  i include the galley ones in the `` soldier '' stuff . 
  by soldier , i mostly meant war stuff . 
  it was mostly the uses . 
  the slaves from eastern europe were mostly sold to the ottoman empire . 
  there they were trained as janissaries and and bureaucrats . 
  there were n't massive plantations that needed intense slave labour to sustain . 
  essentially , slaves from eastern europe mostly ended up as either soldiers or bound bureaucrats . 
  serfdom is not slavery . 
  the slave raids were not to gather serfs , they were to gather slaves that were being sold , most of them to the ottoman empire and beyond . 
  there were differences between the eastern slave trade and the americas one but do n't confuse it with serfdom . 
  there are no spots , the more the merrier  you can join the next week if you want , not join the week after , join then 2 weeks after with a different country etc it will be a looser and more casual game , not heavily regimented .
