  `` the dude actively supported terrorists who killed british children '' is another quite silly scandal xd, 
  it 's like a piece of heaven on earth that you can eat and is as delicious as you imagine it . 
  if i recall , that guy sued the shit out of them . 
   the assad regime is also completely unstable and he created the civil war in the first place , remember ? 
  i do n't remember that , no . 
  i remember us arming rebels , including isis funnily enough , though . 
   i would rather see an islamist government than assad please tell me you are joking ... 
  the remnants of the free syrian army are unreliable , weak and full of islamists . 
  if they magically won , syria would permanently collapse into a sectarian failed state like somalia . 
  they are n't a viable solution any more . 
  they are a barrier to stability in the area . 
  yeah , let 's allow isis to take over , they are much better than assad !, 
  6 miles is if there is no land . 
  there is land between greece and turkey in those 6 miles so the internationally recognized rules state that the sea border is shared half and half between the 2 border land masses . 
  which turkey does n't recognize . 
  stating facts is n't needless or nationalism and bringing up the fact that turkey has some very skewed ideas about what `` their '' airspace actually is in a thread about turkey shooting down an airplane over an airspace border is not irrelevant . 
  and this is the last response you deserve over this . 
  agreed . 
  that 's the definition of violating other states ' airspace . 
  it would be disputed if there was even a hint of a dispute . 
  there is n't . 
  you are neither funny nor contributing positively to this sub with comments like these . 
  if you had a counter argument , it would have been welcome . 
  right now , all you show is a lack of arguments thinly veiled behind mockery . 
  it 's what the gent above was saying though . 
  i am aware it 's not going to happen , naturally . 
  i am just warning against holding the delusion that in a direct conflict the west would `` win '' . 
  nobody would because we would all die . 
  my territory 's fine . 
  turkey 's claims are still untrustworthy though . 
  barely and only because both the su and the us basically red lighted the use of nukes . 
  greece and turkey do n't have a `` different definition '' mate . 
  we use the internationally agreed definition ( which every state on earth except turkey does recognize ) and you ignore it just cuz . 
  that 's not a different definition . 
  it is you bullshitting about what your airspace is . 
  russia is exactly as strong as nato is if it came to direct war because the only thing that would matter then is nukes and both nato and russia have enough of them to blow the world up several times . 
  russia is weaker millitarily when it comes to conventional warfare in proxy wars but do n't mistake that for an overall millitary weakness . 
  turkey has an equally strong record of bullshitting about what is their airspace though . 
  that is such an incredibly stupid and false statement . 
  i honestly do n't even know where to start ... 
  i think the best place would be with the fact that europe is not in recession the past year and a half ... 
  the same people who were saying `` ding dong the witch is dead '' ( literally the same people often ) were the ones who said we `` should n't celebrate the death of anyone  ) ) '' when osama bin fucking laden died . 
  it was disgusting to see . 
  fun fact : esmeralda in the book the movie 's based off of was a white girl stolen by gypsies at birth . 
  she also died at the end of the book . 
  like , most princesses die in the actual story the disney movies are based on . 
  and how do you count whether it 's axing or not ? 
  do you have to instantly replace him with someone ? 
  is there going to be a time limit to hiring someone else ? 
  what if said ` someone else ' is n't easy to find because it 's a specialized job ? 
  it 's not as simple as differenciating the two . 
  i gave the most obvious example i could think of then , if i dig a bit deeper , i could find a million more examples . 
  what if the company hired someone to install a new security system in the company 's system . 
  does him finishing his contract count as him being fired ? 
  what if a department becomes redundant due to a change in technology ? 
  what if a brief boom in demand happens and they could potentially hire 100 new people for a brief period but know they ca n't keep them for ever ? 
  etc etc i know you do n't defend the policy because ... well , i assume you got a brain , i am just pointing that there are so many holes in it that debating over semantics for one of it is not really worthwhile , in my opinion . 
  hey , sorry for the late comments : ** ira : ** http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-34285308 he apologizes for an earlier comment of his that ira should be honoured . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/jeremy_corbyn/11924431/revealed-jeremy-corbyn-and-john-mcdonnells-close-ira-links.html here is a further report on his ( and corbyn 's ) ira links . 
  some quotes from the article :  it can also be revealed that in 2004 mr mcdonnell , now labour 's shadow chancellor , was given a special award by sinn fein and another ira-supporting body for the `` unfailing political and personal support he has given to the republican community in the six counties over many years . '' the award was given by the ira terrorist gerry kelly by the way . 
   as has been widely reported , mr mcdonnell also honoured ira terrorists , though in his case only after the ceasefire . 
  in his apology for the remarks last month , mr mcdonnell claimed he only made them to promote the peace process . 
  in fact , however , mr mcdonnell told the ira 's official newspaper that he opposed the peace process negotiations to create a power-sharing assembly in what became the good friday agreement . 
   mr corbyn and mr mcdonnell `` work closely '' with the wolfe tone society , according to its convenor , dennis grace , speaking at the 2006 event.it was at the wolfe tone society 's 2003 commemoration that mr mcdonnell made his now notorious comments calling for sands and other terrorists to be `` honoured , '' adding : `` it was the bombs and bullets and sacrifice made by the likes of bobby sands that brought britain to the negotiating table . '' etc etc ** hamas : ** http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/11749043/andrew-gilligan-jeremy-corbyn-friend-to-hamas-iran-and-extremists.html this article has most of what you need but it mostly focuses on corbyn ( who is even more crazy in the hamas front being the chairman of the `` stop the war '' foundation which is a whole different set of whackos ) http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/jeremy_corbyn/11840793/jeremy-corbyn-hamas-praise-israel-palestine-conflict.html also the `` respect '' is two ways with hamas . 
  if you want any further sources , please do tell . 
  he has met them , had rallies with them , personally commended and offered awards to them and is a leading member to several organizations that explicitly promote their causes . 
  i can , and will , offer the sources for that in 4 hours when i get home . 
  i have them saved ( did some extensive research on him ) and i really do n't feel like looking them up again . 
  if you ca n't wait , what i am saying is easily googlable with results from trustworthy sources . 
  their `` programs '' go far beyond what is reasonable . 
  if they taxed people with the states purpose of pilling the money and setting it on fire , it would be equally as absurd . 
  not all taxation is robbery . 
  this is . 
  reason does not equal purpose . 
  the reason behind taxes is clear : to punish the rich . 
  there is no purpose , ie , goal behind the taxation . 
  that money do n't * need * to be collected . 
  it 's what you think . 
  in fact , it is even stupider than that . 
  the far left took power in the labour party unfortunately . 
  this same guy is also buddies with ira , hezbollah and hamas terrorists . 
  london is the biggest financial centre in the world , bigger than even wall street . 
  yes it is robery . 
  taxes are there to serve a purpose , not as a punitive tool . 
  what these idiots are proposing is state sanctioned mugging . 
  problem is , the dude helped with drafting that letter ... you ca n't really help draft something without at least reading it . 
  `` what 's that ? 
  you sexually harassed women in the office ? 
  i would fire you , but since corbyn 's in office and i want to keep my business , let 's pretend it did n't happen ! '', 
  why did the brits inflict this man and his fellow lunatics on themselves ? 
  the comment chain i responded to was talking specifically about people from third world countries in general , not syrians . 
  read it again mate . 
  context is important on what is being said , 
  i care about human rights but these people are not refugees and thus , according to the convention you just quoted , we have no obligation to take them in . 
  why ? 
  ... there are people who do n't know that ? 
  i always assumed if you knew what hagia sophia is , you knew it used to be a church . 
  starting money for poorer parents to buy the baby clothes , toys , a bed etc it 's meant to cheapen newborn children and thus encourage having more . 
  honestly , the idea is sound but i prefer systems where , instead of cash , they provide the actual items to the parents on request ( see : finland 's baby box ), 
  this is absolutely correct .
