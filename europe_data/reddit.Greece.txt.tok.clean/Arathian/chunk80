  as the economist went to press , mrs merkel was considered a favourite to win the nobel peace prize .

  the numbers are dramatic . 
  more than 200,000 migrants are believed to have arrived in germany in september alone .

  in dresden , a xenophobic movement called pegida is growing again : about 9,000 protested this monday against refugees . 
  mainstream society is tolerant but edgy . 
  in a survey by german public television 51 % of germans say that they fear the refugee influx , 13 points more than in september . 
  approval of mrs merkel dropped by 9 points to her lowest level since 2011 ( though it is still a respectable 54 % ) . 
  in two other polls mrs merkel slid from germany 's most popular politician to fourth . 
  the fiercest criticism of mrs merkel comes from within her own conservative bloc -- the christian democratic union ( cdu ) , which she leads , and the christian social union ( csu ) , which exists only in bavaria and usually supports her . 
  horst seehofer , the csu 's boss and premier of bavaria , called mrs merkel 's decision `` a mistake that will keep us occupied for a long time '' . 
  in one meeting he threatened half-seriously to drop off busloads of refugees at the federal parliament in berlin . 
  gerda hasselfeldt , a csu parliamentary leader , wants to erect transit zones along germany 's borders like those in airports . 
  markus s\u00f6der , bavaria 's finance minister , has called for a fence . 
  a group of christian democrats calling itself the `` security club '' debated closing germany 's borders to refugees entirely . 
  another group has written a letter to mrs merkel charging that her refugee policy breaks the law . 
  in response mrs merkel 's government is scrambling to make changes . 
  it has passed legislation that cuts pocket money to refugees , currently $ 143 ( $ 160 ) a month , and replaces it with vouchers . 
  more police and administrators are being hired . 
  all balkan countries have been declared `` safe '' so that their asylum applicants can be rejected and deported faster . 
  on october 6th mrs merkel took charge of co-ordinating refugee policy , in effect demoting the interior minister , thomas de maizi\u00e8re . 
  none of this , however , will reduce the numbers of syrians , iraqis and afghans who are fleeing war . 
  nor will last month 's agreement by the european union to allocate 120,000 refugees among member states . 
  mrs merkel had lobbied fiercely for it , but the compromise will barely dent germany 's refugee numbers . 
  she is now concentrating her effort on getting turkey , whence most refugees cross into the eu , to intercept and keep more migrants . 
  but turkey already hosts more than 2m . 
  it will demand concessions such as easing visa restrictions for turks entering the eu . 
  it will also expect germany to tone down criticism of turkish crackdowns on the press and on kurdish separatists . 
  it may ask for german help to create a buffer zone in syria . 
  meanwhile , germans have begun to feel that the refugee crisis could change germany even more than reunification did 25 years ago . 
  back then the task was to let that which belongs together grow together , as willy brandt , a former chancellor , famously said . 
  speaking on october 3rd , the anniversary of unification , mr gauck -- like mrs merkel a former east german -- said that today 's challenge is greater because `` what should now grow together has so far not belonged together . '' germans worry whether muslim refugees will accept german norms of sexual equality , secularism and germany 's special responsibility towards israel and jews . 
  the backlash does not yet threaten mrs merkel 's hold on power . 
  while extremist parties have become serious contenders for power in some other european countries , they remain marginal in germany , and voters have faith that their government will restore order , says timo lochocki of the german marshall fund , a think-tank . 
  the chancellor faces no christian democratic challenger . 
  the centre-left social democrats are internally torn . 
  and the leftist opposition can not attack her for a refugee policy they themselves support . 
  mrs merkel is under pressure as never before . 
  yet the crisis has brought out a new style of leadership in her . 
  for years she has been accused of following public opinion rather than guiding it . 
  now she has found her moral calling . 
  `` if we start having to apologise for showing a friendly face in emergencies , '' she says defiantly , `` then this is not my country . '', 
  discussed this with the mods . 
  reposting the article so it can get visibility ( as per their instructions ) . 
  i think that would be very probably if immigration from outside of the eu was anywhere near a popular idea . 
  currently , germany has the option to invite far more popular immigrants from eastern europe to come to germany and many do already so it 's not like she had to end up in a political storm to get young people to come over . 
  hey , thanks for the information . 
  may i suggest you keep this however ? 
  the economist is a highly prestigious publication and it does add some interesting facts not mentioned in the article linked . 
  those two combined , i think , will mean that this thread merits to stay up . 
  if you do n't agree with that though , i wo n't push it , 
   i refuse to believe this is simply down to her ` morals ' . 
  i honestly consider it a possibility . 
  merkel is famous for not taking radical stances without public approval first . 
  she did something extraordinary with the refugees ( in the literal sense of the word : something that she usually never does . ) . 
  unless she has some master plan nobody can really see , she probably honestly believed this was the `` right thing to do '' . 
  ** full post for those without an economist subscription ** : what a difference a month makes . 
  on the night of september 4th angela merkel made the most dramatic decision of her decade as german chancellor : to suspend european asylum rules and allow tens of thousands of refugees stranded in hungary to enter germany via austria . 
  it was a moral gesture that fitted the mood of the moment . 
  as the economist went to press , mrs merkel was considered a favourite to win the nobel peace prize . 
  in germany , however , that altruistic embrace has caused a backlash that could weaken a chancellor so far considered all but invincible . 
  using uncharacteristically missionary language , mrs merkel said repeatedly that the right to asylum has `` no upper limit '' .
