  another group has written a letter to mrs merkel charging that her refugee policy breaks the law . 
  in response mrs merkel 's government is scrambling to make changes . 
  it has passed legislation that cuts pocket money to refugees , currently $ 143 ( $ 160 ) a month , and replaces it with vouchers . 
  more police and administrators are being hired . 
  all balkan countries have been declared `` safe '' so that their asylum applicants can be rejected and deported faster . 
  on october 6th mrs merkel took charge of co-ordinating refugee policy , in effect demoting the interior minister , thomas de maizi\u00e8re . 
  none of this , however , will reduce the numbers of syrians , iraqis and afghans who are fleeing war . 
  nor will last month 's agreement by the european union to allocate 120,000 refugees among member states . 
  mrs merkel had lobbied fiercely for it , but the compromise will barely dent germany 's refugee numbers . 
  she is now concentrating her effort on getting turkey , whence most refugees cross into the eu , to intercept and keep more migrants . 
  but turkey already hosts more than 2m . 
  it will demand concessions such as easing visa restrictions for turks entering the eu . 
  it will also expect germany to tone down criticism of turkish crackdowns on the press and on kurdish separatists . 
  it may ask for german help to create a buffer zone in syria . 
  meanwhile , germans have begun to feel that the refugee crisis could change germany even more than reunification did 25 years ago . 
  back then the task was to let that which belongs together grow together , as willy brandt , a former chancellor , famously said . 
  speaking on october 3rd , the anniversary of unification , mr gauck -- like mrs merkel a former east german -- said that today 's challenge is greater because `` what should now grow together has so far not belonged together . '' germans worry whether muslim refugees will accept german norms of sexual equality , secularism and germany 's special responsibility towards israel and jews . 
  the backlash does not yet threaten mrs merkel 's hold on power . 
  while extremist parties have become serious contenders for power in some other european countries , they remain marginal in germany , and voters have faith that their government will restore order , says timo lochocki of the german marshall fund , a think-tank . 
  the chancellor faces no christian democratic challenger . 
  the centre-left social democrats are internally torn . 
  and the leftist opposition can not attack her for a refugee policy they themselves support . 
  mrs merkel is under pressure as never before . 
  yet the crisis has brought out a new style of leadership in her . 
  for years she has been accused of following public opinion rather than guiding it . 
  now she has found her moral calling . 
  `` if we start having to apologise for showing a friendly face in emergencies , '' she says defiantly , `` then this is not my country . '', 
  [ this is the imperial eagle ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bd/imperial_eagle.jpg ) and yes , it is based off the nazi eagle ( obviously ) . 
  a lot of themes of warhammer 40k are based off of nazi germany which does make sense since the empire is a fascist theocracy . 
  you have a point under certain assumptions : * we have no fucking way to put a child in temporary foster care * we ca n't possibly make sure a child is , in fact , abused before stealing it from their parents . 
  * this ` certain assumptions ' nonsense does n't make you look smart and is fucking obnoxious . 
   it makes perfect sense under certain assumptions : u wot m8 ? 
  all `` refugees '' welcome . 
  while herr merkel can consider people passing through half a dozen safe countries `` refugees '' , international law and said half dozen countries do n't . 
  when she said that , she advocated for illegal immigration . 
  we do allow and do have plenty of mosques in greece as well as publicly funded imams . 
  the story you heard was about a mosque in * athens * which we do n't have . 
  our mosques are mostly in thrace to accommodate the traditional muslim minority there . 
  the controversy in athens is due to the muslims there being almost exclusively illegal immigrants . 
  many oppose it on the grounds of accommodating illegal immigrants rather than purely on religious grounds . 
  no , threatening speech is speech aluding to specific , violent actions that you intend to take ( eg . 
  death threat on the style of `` i will come to your house and murder you '' ) , direct incitement to violence ( see the american above who copy-pasted the rulling on that one . 
  the gist of it is : it has to be direct and imminent , not a general notion . 
  for example `` let 's kill this jew '' rather than `` i think we should kill all the jews '' ) or what is known as fighting words that try to directly provoke someone into a fight ( this is very rarely accepted in court where it is a clause ) . 
  yes , there are no good reasons to punish non-threatening speech . 
  i consider the law in greece a bad one and would support its repeal . 
  the [ source ] ( http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/briefings/fiscal-impact-immigration-uk ) says this :  the fiscal impact of migration in the uk is small and differs by migrant group ( e.g. 
  eea migrants vs. non-eea migrants , recent migrants vs. all migrants )  dustmann and fratini ( 2013 ) estimated the fiscal impact of eea and non-eea migrants during the 1995-2011 period . 
  their results suggest that during this period the total fiscal impact of eea migrants in the uk was close to gbp + 8.8 billion per year ( an average of close to gbp + 0.6 billion per year ) . 
  the total fiscal impact of non-eea migrants for this period was estimated at gbp -104 ( an average of close to gbp -6.5 billion per year ) . 
  i do n't see how that contradicts what the article says ? 
  as for the `` muslim '' thing , while the characterization is clunky , it helps seperate immigration from the european countries * as well as * other western countries ( such as the us or canada ) and the large amount of immigrants coming from north africa , middle east and pakistan/afghanistan . 
  while culturally those nations are not very similar , they have pretty similar impact on the countries that accept them so grouping them together , again , while clunky , is functional enough . 
  er , what is your specific objection ? 
  when he is talking about muslim immigration , he tries to differenciate it from intra-eu immigration rather than refer to the religion in itself ( the reason he uses muslim rather than some other term is because those immigrants come from a huge variety of places that only have in common their religion ) . 
  note : this is a resubmission . 
  i found the same article copied in another blog . 
  the article itself is excellent but the blog that had copied it ( i found the article by chance ) was a racist blog trying to push an agenda . 
  this blog , however , clearly is n't and the article is reasonable . 
  please give it a read and check the sources . 
  ----- this article is a response to [ ** this ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvonxh3nn9w&amp;ab_channel=inanutshell%e2%80%93kurzgesagt ) video by the youtube channel `` in a nutshell '' that was posted a couple of weeks back . 
  i think it is a good refutation of certain points . 
  especially the crime rates of immigration part of the video . 
  yeah . 
  just checked and you are absolutely right . 
  in fact , as ivashkin pointed out , the article is n't even theirs . 
  i did stumble upon the blog randomly and just checked that single article ( and its sources ) and they all checked out . 
  i did n't realize what kind of blog they were nor thay they had copied the article . 
  deleting the thread and submitting the original . 
  my apologies . 
  thanks . 
  just woke up . 
  the article seemed excellent ( checked all sources before submitting ) . 
  i did n't see it was copied from somewhere else though . 
  i did find the blog on paul * cough * so i probably should have checked more .

  that it 's banned does n't mean it is right . 
  the law is n't always right . 
  honestly , read the conversation below this comment . 
  been going back and forth on this for quite a while . 
   it 's still not absolute which was my original point . 
  it should be and the obsene material clause is debatable for 2 reasons : most obsene but harmless material ( like pornography ) are not banned but merely restricted from public sight due to an age limit on accessing them ( children have different rights and not the usual human rights ) . 
  the law kicks into effect for material that are produced due to harming others , like child pornography which is banned . 
  that has been a big debate but the general consensus is that the right to not be harmed tramples the right to free speech in these cases . 
  usually , when 2 rights contradict each other , it has to be solved on case by case basis . 
   i guess you can be thankful you 're not in the uk then  i really am in many ways . 
  i did live there for 6 months . 
  nice people but the government interference was too much . 
   so that 'd be no . 
  quite the opposite . 
  free speech , as defined , has a few exceptions detailed in the us law . 
  those cases are not * speech * though . 
  the only exception that is debatable is the clause about obscene material . 
  so the answer is `` somewhat '' . 
   they 're human rights but i also think people not having to listen to hate speech , racism and the like are also human rights . 
  there is no right to not be offended . 
  quite frankly , it sickens me that some people are so weak and thin skinned that they crawl up and whine at the first sign of disagreement . 
  the idea that you have the right to not be offended is the biggest cause of censorship in modern times and it is disturbing .
