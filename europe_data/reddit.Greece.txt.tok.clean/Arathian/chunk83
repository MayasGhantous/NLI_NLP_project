  food is such a large market that you can not possibly strangle out competition by temporarily lowering prices because the entry cost is incredibly low ( and will remain so . 
  farmland is very cheap these days ) . 
  farmers will just switch from gmos to non-gmos the moment they can make a better profit out of that . 
  if they raise prices through the roof , non-gmo products will be competitive again so that will also not be a problem . 
  you are arguing for lower competition and unnaturally promoting a certain product that is more expensive because the more competitive product might become as expensive as the current product . 
  do n't you see how that is counter-productive ? 
  ttip is a free trade agreement . 
  if a company refuses to comply with it ( and it will only do so if pressured by a government . 
  companies do n't do random stuff ) ttip will already be violated by the other party so you would be in the clear . 
  why ? 
  if they decide to fuck you over , you can always ignore the licence . 
  the corporation is here to make money , not to fuck over poland . 
  by the same count , you should n't trust car or petroleum sources and ban those too because they might stop exporting them . 
  `` ough , here come the facts , fuck off '' straight from the far-right wing guardian newspaper http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2010/sep/21/claim-asylum-uk-legal-position here are the important bits : `` article 33 of the convention prohibits `` refoulement '' of refugees -- ie removal to places or countries where their lives or freedom would be at risk on account of their race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion . 
  the convention also imposes other obligations on states , such as to secure equal treatment for refugees and issue special travel documents to refugees , which can be used instead of their national passport . 
  the effect of the convention is that states are required to determine asylum claims made by anyone within their territory . 
  the principal exception to this is where there is a safe third country to which the person can be sent in order for substantive consideration to be given to their claim . 
  removing a person to a safe third country will not engage the removing state 's obligations under the convention unless doing so exposes the person to a real risk of refoulement . 
  ** there is no obligation under the refugee convention or any other instrument of international law that requires refugees to seek asylum in any particular country . 
  there has , however , been a longstanding `` first country of asylum '' principle in international law by which countries are expected to take refugees fleeing from persecution in a neighbouring state . 
  this principle has developed so that , in practice , an asylum seeker who had the opportunity to claim asylum in another country is liable to be returned there in order for his or her claim to be determined . 
  ** '' so books have been written , you just have n't read them . 
  he assumes you are poor , i think . 
  no you fucking did n't . 
  take your sarcasm and choke on it . 
  you did n't help in the crisis . 
  you have never helped the past decade when we were swarmed with illegal immigrants from the middle east and now you are bitter because you have to bear the same shit we have for a decade now . 
  yeah , illegal swarms fucking suck . 
  no , greece ca n't hold back 3 million immigrants . 
  they are going to you . 
  if you do n't like that , fund us enough to be able to deal with it . 
  so far , we have received exactly 0 help from you . 
  rome was n't the first reich . 
  first reich was the holy roman empire . 
  second reich was the kaiserreich in 1870 . 
  sushi counts , go for it !, 
  it 's true that public interest is very nebulous and debatable . 
  heck , the example i gave to the other chap is debatable too . 
  what is a common accepted clause however is that the eminent domain has to be used for a * work * which confiscating property to house immigrants unambiguously is n't . 
  i think that kills the argument on that front . 
  on a personal note , i am not too font of the ( in my opinion ) overuse of the public interest excuse , especially when it comes to private projects . 
  that is , however , a different issue . 
  it 's not a * work of public interest * . 
  the wording has a very specific meaning . 
  it would count , for example , if the government bought a large amount of land to build a huge housing complex . 
  confiscating property is not a work , even if you consider the housing a `` public interest '' . 
  a biit of salt with lemon is okey , i think but yes , too much and it ruins each other . 
  sorry , no idea how to make koulouria . 
  most greeks ( including me ) simply buy them from street vendors/bakeries . 
  next week i intend to do greek side dishes . 
  eminent domain ( at least in all the countries whose constitutions i know ) is specific to works of public interest . 
  these are , essentially , roads , hospitals etc where an immigrant will live is not a work of public interest so that does not apply to it . 
  doing so would be a gross violation to the human right to hold his property unmolested . 
  you are essentially advocating for a violation of human rights . 
  in my village , it was always beef and i mostly use beef when i make them myself so i might be a bit biased :p at any rate , all those kinds of meat i listed work well so meh . 
  damn straight . 
  sliced thin , yep . 
  https://visualdeliciousness.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_7536.jpg like this , but instead of full round , cut it in 3 pieces each, 
  in salad , always raw . 
  cooked is for other stuff . 
  for this week 's thread , i have another recipe . 
  all you americans or other people who have a grill/grill like machine will be excited : [ ** souvlaki !, 
  ** ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/souvlaki-plate.jpg ) preparation : you need meat . 
  the meat can really vary . 
  beef is the most common , but lamb , pork , chicken and even swordfish work really well . 
  cut it in rough , roundish pieces like the picture . 
  many people also love adding cut veggies , like peppers or even tomatoes . 
  personally , not a huge fun , but i know many people love it . 
  you need large , about 6-8 inches ( 15-20 cm ) wooden sticks . 
  if you do n't have that , metal sticks also work . 
  for wooden sticks , you probably want to let them soak in water for a few minutes before use . 
  helps keep them from burning up but it is by no means obligatory . 
  so , you skewer the meat leaving a bit on both ends for holding . 
  put your grill on high and wait for it to heat up . 
  when it does , throw the skewered meat on it . 
  turn it around every couple of minutes . 
  when the meat starts taking a colour , you add lots of lemon , a bit of olive oil , oregano , salt and pepper . 
  you can also add garlic but it 's kind of meh in my opinion . 
  right before you remove them ( after they have been skewered to about `` medium well '' status always ) you can add paprika . 
  that depends how much you like paprica . 
  some do n't put any at all , i love having a fair amount . 
  done !, 
  brilliant souvlaki sticks . 
  side dishes : traditionally ( and as the picture shows ) you have french fries with this . 
  you can also have grilled bread with added olive oil and oregano as side dish as well as some feta cheese to go with the french fries . 
  alternatively , some pita bread is also great !, 
  and of course , [ greek salad ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3lv4re/tuesday_cooking_20150922/cv9ma4n ) which i explained how to do last week . 
  [ enjoy !, 
   ] ( http://kalofagas.ca/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/img_2232.jpg ), 
  you are too late germoney [ too late !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3lv4re/tuesday_cooking_20150922/cv9ma4n ) also  cubes heathenry , heresy , ban him mods and for the love of god , no lettuce !, 
  and for the next ~ 20-25 years , we can pay them while slowly rising the age people need to reach while taking * state * pensions and when the privatization is complete , it can be re-adjusted as normal . 
  it honestly is n't as hard as you might think . 
  just needs the slightest degree of competence from the government ... which yeah , i know , but it 's honestly not that hard . 
  pensions will inevitably become privatized . 
  people today are not working taxing jobs and have much higher life spans . 
  there is no reason such an extensive government support is needed any more . 
  only for the poorest people it is necessary . 
  it 's not bad for the economy , that 's bullshit ( edit : to clarify . 
  it 's not an attack on you .
