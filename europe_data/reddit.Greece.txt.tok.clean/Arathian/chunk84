  i just really hate the idea that smaller populations are somehow `` bad for the economy '' . 
  you stumbled on my pet peeve ) . 
  a declining population obviously will eventually slow down the gdp , but that is irrelevant to the economic health of a country . 
  there is no reason to believe it would lead to a lower gdp per capita or a lesser purchasing power of individuals . 
  the only thing we should start thinking about is privatizing pensions with only basic pensions for poorer people . 
  besides that , there will be 0 impact in the economy . 
  we do n't live in the 19th century . 
  we have machines , we do n't need masses to work . 
  the salt is real . 
  :\\ ^ ) although that means that , currently , we have 0 na located mods . 
  if you wan na shitpost , you know the time folks !, 
  mods can mod neutrally and according to the rules . 
  their personal beliefs are nearly irrelevant if they desire to mod neutrally . 
  as far as i can tell , none of these mods intends to push a personal agenda . 
  the one mod nominee that would is conspicuously absent from here , 
  grats to all the new mods !, 
  may your reign be long and bloody !, 
  also , righteous ... maybe . 
  yes we do . 
  although we usually do it to extremes . 
  when i was younger , i wanted to see snow . 
  right now , it 's mostly rain . 
  sorry to hear that mate . 
  i will take you off . 
  for what it is worth , i disagree with what you say . 
  i think you would be a fantastic mod , but your wishes are naturally respected . 
  well your country is n't real . 
  look who has pie on their face now !, 
  ma man !, 
   mouth actually we take cues from the black mirror, 
  i disapprove of stuff that are generally disapproved by right wing people but do n't want to ban them . 
  because i am a libertarian . 
   medium . 
  bare pass . 
  congratulations on your c :p, 
  how do you prefer your steak ? 
  this is a make or break question by the way !, 
  pence decided to run for vp instead . 
  er , marktplatz is not a mod of any subreddit ? 
  nope . 
  afaik , only 1 of our new mods is a mod for a major subreddit and it 's a gaming one . 
  this is the actual list . 
  it 's a `` if you guys do n't have any objections , these are the new mods '' list , 
  he is on the mod list , 
  only cool mod kids get this reference !, 
  yes he is . 
  well you 'd think that but well ... 
  well , it is easier when you use tags . 
  res helps with that . 
  also if someone has a large + or - sign next to their name , it draws your attention , usually . 
  he will be a great mod , yeah . 
  but man does being constantly accused of being a commienazi take a toll on you , 
  that report button makes mean people disappear in the night and go into the building where a lot of people enter , but not many seem to leave :\\ ^ ), 
  that 's entirely correct . 
  you still ca n't call us names though :p, 
  swamp german :p, 
  i am a social conservative libertarian , nationalist and anti-eu . 
  we have a few more left than right in the mod team , sure , but to be fair , it probably closely reflects the actual sub make up . 
  let 's not forget reddit tends to have younger people and younger people tend to be more leftist . 
  i am anti-eu . 
  my flair was literally `` fuck the eu '' for a year :p it just is n't relevant when i actually mod . 
  we do n't really add based on political opinions ( we have both left and right wing in the mod team ) but we do take heavily into account whether or not they believe in politically neutral moderation . 
  they are only k. damn young ` uns , back in my days we were all excellent . 
  what happened with excellency in this generation , i 'll go grab my cane .
