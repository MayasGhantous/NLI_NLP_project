  you are not getting me mad mate . 
  enjoy your new president :\\ ^ ), 
  i hear he will also put em in gas chambers and nuke california . 
  honestly , i am giddy about that . 
  watching the smug vanish and replaced with panic is beautiful . 
  more than 95 % actually , it just wo n't go higher without calling it . 
  nope , same here . 
  i need to make the / r/the _ the_meltdown_meltdown sub,

  god emperor *, 
  http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/president trump at 78 % chance of winning right now . 
  tell them to go home and that you will vote farage to build a big , beautiful wall between america and scotland and make american pay for it . 
  ahahahah that 's great , feast on the tears . 
  if it comes to that , there would be so much backroom dealing that predicting what would happen is not very easy . 
  but i think it 's fair to say that the house would be compelled to choose one of the two candidates else they would risk a crisis . 
  clinton has sold her soul already , so one more time would n't mean much . 
  she would simply make agreements with mainstream gop about things like justices and policies and have a gop vice president to watch over her . 
  that would be my guess . 
  correct me if i am wrong , but my understanding was that this is specifically not the case when the congress picks a president , only when someone runs for president . 
  most of the rules go out of the window in a tie . 
  again , that was my understanding , i might be wrong . 
  apologies .

  ~ ~ make america british again 2016 ~ ~ make america great britain again 2016 ^ ^ ^ ^ / u/goshdarned _ cunt 's ^ ^ ^ ^ idea, 
  considering actual establishment republicans have publicly announced they would vote for hillary ( the bushes for example ) , i would n't be so sure .

  ach , ok , my bad then !, 
  my understanding was that the original revolution was the one who started doing things like banning the teaching of other languages , closing down churches , persecuting priests etc , the 1913 revolution just intensified it . 
  if not , my apologies ( although my general point stands ), 
   even pontus greeks or anatolian greeks that werent understood by european greeks that 's not entirely correct , by the way . 
  many/most pontus greeks could speak standard greek ( with an accent ) . 
  they just mostly preferred to speak their local version for obvious reasons . 
  even today , many can speak their dialects and that 's a very common trait amongst greeks with most regions having a local dialect that 's semi-incomprehensible to other greeks ( see : cretan , cypriot as other examples ), 
  obviously it 's a matter of debate to what extend , but to say there was no strong correlation between religion and nationality back then is ... kinda wrong , sorry . 
  most greeks that converted to islam were fully fledged turks in a few generations . 
  most armenians who did were the same etc let 's not forget that turks were initially small scale raiders from the east and they were never large in numbers despite their conquests . 
  the vast majority of turks today are local populations ( greeks , armenians , georgians , assyrians , arabs etc ) who converted to islam and started following the turkish customs . 
  there was no major population displacement until 1929 . 
  there was still some distinction , sure . 
  for example , many albanians , despite being muslim , still held onto their albanian identity and were friendly to greeks , for example , but the simply fact is , religion  nationality back then . 
  oh , right . 
  kinda ? 
  culture and religion were extremely closely interconnected up until 1929 in the balkans/ottoman empire . 
  to be a turk , you had to be a muslim . 
  to be a serb/greek/bulgarian etc you had to be christian . 
  the seperation of nationality and religion came afterwards . 
  for example , when the greek hero of independence , kolokotronis , was fighting in the peloponnese , he made a special effort to kill the `` proskinimenoi '' , aka greeks who had become muslims and were seen as turkish traitors . 
  eh , that 's not the full story though . 
  you are correct of course , but the armenians became radicalized especially after the young turks coup tried to force the turkish language and culture on them violently in 1908 . 
  so did all other nations and it was what prompted the first balkan war . 
   leaders of the sunni , orthodox , bektashi , and catholic communities of albania , in paris , 11 january 2015 from wikipedia, 
  it 's not an asinine nitpick . 
  that guy is not referring to turks when he mentions a line of genocidal scumbags . 
  he refers to erdogan and his ideology . 
  one would be racism and the bannable and the other is criticising ideology which is allowed . 
  i will not remove/ban the comment as a result . 
  it would be deleted because it 's editorialized , old and agenda pushing . 
  it breaks half our rules . 
  it 's not about actual ancestry , he talks about the * ideology * of it , not the actual people . 
  it 's why he is n't banned/warned , he is not talking about genus or something . 
  he is talking about ideology/ideas . 
  you are allowed to criticize those in general . 
  he said erdogan comes from genocidal scumbags , not turks . 
  there is a big difference unless you believe erdogan = turks ? 
  oh , i actually misread your statement ( was on the road while doing it ) . 
  i thought it was a response to a user . 
  my bad .
