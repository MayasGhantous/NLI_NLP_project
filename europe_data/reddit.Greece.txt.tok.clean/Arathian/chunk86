  consider the warning revoked . 
  because we maintain a certain quality . 
  the reason the sub does n't read like the front page of a local newspaper on its better days is because we guide it towards a certain level of quality . 
  this is your first and only warning for mod whining considering you are a new account .

  you are officially warned for low effort circlejerking . 
  jeez are n't you a bundle of sunshine . 
  eh ... we usually remove these if they are that boring . 
  but they might get approved . 
  they almost always die with 0-1 comments and 0 upvotes so it does n't matter much . 
  well , we had an actual rule change so . . 
  eh , my grandfather was part of edes too . 
  but direct insults are not allowed . 
  all languages are fine and encouraged !, 
  we do greatly prefer to have a translation in the comments of the article if it 's in a non-english language . 
  even the gist of it is fine . 
  title should always be a translation of the article 's title in english , however . 
   you 're a fucking asshole . 
  no personal attacks please . 
  edit your comment to be re-approved . 
  first is okey because it 's probably a story of national interest . 
  second , depends . 
  if it has european interest ( they were to be transported in another eu country for example ) then yes . 
  third , yes , it 's fairly unique/funny . 
  if it was `` criminal with loaded rifle arrested in hamburg '' or something like that , no . 
  yep !, 
  no , it was explicitly the nazi salute . 
  i am a bit ambivalent on metaxas being ideologically a fascist , but he certainly toyed with a lot of fascist ideas , such as youth leagues and symbols ( including the salute ) . 
  we do n't really celebrate ww1 much because , though we won , we had the minor asia catastrophe as a result , so we did n't really win . 
  haha yeah , i saw that after i posted the thread and went `` welp , nobody will notice , right ? '', 
  well , to be fair , we are also the only non-axis power to have initial success in ww2 !, 
  there you go folks . 
  yes , we do listen to what you have to say !,

  not that high , especially on basic products like foodstuffs and milk . 
  in fact many countries ( including sweden i think ) have 0 or near 0 tax on these products . 
  then we have increasing taxes on vital industries like tourism that are choking them . 
  so the tax itself is common but the tax is uncommonly high right now . 
  you can . 
  thank you . 
  excellent ama !, 
  not really . 
  prices did not actually drop during the crisis ( in most products , they actually disproportionally rose ) . 
  we just had good ol' growth for a small period . 
  there are other arguments ( the growth was because we supposedly stopped paying interest , the growth was because of nd doing a last minute spur to keep power etc ) . 
  as far as i am concerned , most of these criticisms are either inaccurate or invalid . 
   at the end of 2014 we were almost at the end of the tunnel : some growth was apparent and we finally had a primary surplus . 
  yes !, 
  thank you !, 
  when i say the same thing , i am called crazy . 
  `` our growth was fake '' , `` it was simply a ` on the books ' growth which would have no effect on the people '' etc good to see someone up in the echelons who actually recognizes reality . 
  this is an official warning for agenda pushing . 
  thank you for joining us for this ama  i think it 's fair to state that your time as a minister did not solve the many problems greece had and today we are down in a very dark place . 
  with full retrospect , essentially if you were placed today back when you started as a minister , what would you have done differently ? 
  do you believe there could be a way to avoid all this ? 
  or way it unavoidable regardless of who was in the helm ? 
  thank you again for your time . 
  like , what mod actions ? 
  we try to be as open as possible with our practices lately . 
  we will respond to users whose comments we remove with verbal warnings , we always respond in / r/europemeta and so on . 
  a year past , yeah , there were valid complains , but `` recent '' does n't imply that : /, 
  i am 99 % sure if that had happened , either the ottoman empire would have imploded spectacularly , him instantly ovethrown ( most likely although he was generally super respected , so he stood a chance even after rocking the boat so hard ) or , in the rare chance he succeeded , almost all of the balkans would have assimilated after 400 years of occupation so today turkey would extend to bosnia , most likely . 
  as i said , it 's extremely rare and there are no standard cases . 
  usually if it 's a neutral question being asked and it has already gotten a lot of upvotes before we got to it , we will let it slide . 
  there has been only 1 case in my memory where we let slide a political thread that was n't neutral and it was because the op used a shitton of sources to back up his claims and had a ton of excellent discussion in it .

  my message was the following  to have an article approved , link directly to the article . 
  the rest are the pre-made message from the editorialization removal reason . 
  it 's how we do removal stuff . 
  i do n't copy paste that thing every time . 
   did you remove it because it was a self post ? 
  because self posts are not being removed as far as i know . 
  i removed it for multiple reasons : 1 ) it was a political self-post which we always remove with very very few exceptions . 
  2 ) it linked to banned sources ( foxnews ) 3 ) and of course , it was also completely editorialized . 
  any single one of these 3 reasons would have been enough for removing it . 
  we do n't allow anything but directly linking the article and we remove all self-posts . 
  this will always be removed . 
  the other thread i approved myself because it did what is correct : link to the article .
