  `` hey did you know you would be better off right now if you were an ex-ussr country ? 
  whose progeny * ancestors = lived before the current generation , 
  to be fair , and while i think mannerheim is a great man in history ( especially finland 's history ) he has no place as a statue in russia . 
  many hundreds of thousands more russians are dead because of him . 
  similarly how ataturk is a great man , flat out , but i was pissed off when that retard mayor wanted to place a statue of him in thessaloniki . 
  not because the man 's not deserving a statue but because statues are there to symbolize figures who helped our country . 
  so the mistake was placing the statue in the first place . 
  the vandalism was only natural . 
  yes and yes . 
  google subsidized , learn what it means . 
  it 's a very simple concept , you are being cocky and i am not your english school teacher . 
  learn what words mean . 
  i said tuition because tuition is mentioned above . 
  i am not bloody familiar with the inner workings of norwegian colleges . 
   if 1,000 people live in the state and 100 of them go to school , but everyone pays the tax that funds the school , the students get free internet no , the students get * subsidized * internet . 
  it 's not free . 
  it would only be free if , as the person above mentioned , the company gave it away , like how google does when it puts fiber . 
  you are both incorrect and cocky about it . 
  double whamy of ignorance !, 
  free means no cost was incurred to you . 
  which is not the case here as you do pay for the internet through your tuition . 
  this is honestly very simple as concepts go .
