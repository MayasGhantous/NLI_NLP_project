  you are giving me a lot of work and this does not bode well for you . 
  this is a 2nd warning for personal attacks . 
  this is a warning for personal attacks . 
  hi , thank you for your contribution , but this submission has been removed because it is low quality . 
  see [ community rules & guidelines ] ( / r/europe/wiki / community_rules ) . 
  if you have any questions about this removal , please [ contact the mods ] ( / message/compose / ? to = / r/europe & subject = moderation ) . 
  please report these people , do n't personally attack them . 
  both you and / u/dukenpl are warned for shitflinging . 
  yes , the other guy is worse but that does n't mean you breaking the rules less than him is acceptable . 
  please do n't do that in the future . 
  [ and it just happened :p ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ssvgg ), 
  here 's my counter-argument : ur a nerr lol, 
  i think he understood you , 
  awww thanks :3, 
  haha , yeah . 
  no worries !, 
  i just dislike their rule because it kinda implies they own polandball . 
  i am just kinda soapboxing my frustration with it when i can , do n't mind me :p, 
  except stereotypes used for comedic effect is not , in any way , racism . 
  i was in krautchan before polandball was a thing . 
  i was in the actual thread that autistic brit made the first polandball for wojak . 
  i think that qualifies me to be able to say polandball whenever the fuck i want and the sub has no right to tell me what to do with polandball . 
  / r/polandball it 's based on krautchan 's polandball comics . 
  basically , geopolitical humour . 
  quite nice if you are into that . 
  edit : [ speaking of the devil , and yes , they banned me from their sub in which i have never posted ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ssvgg ), 
  it 's not racist , subtly or otherwise . 
  not all non-pc humour based on stereotypes is racist . 
  in fact , they have stricter rules than even us on the subject . 
  i was there . 
  i uploaded the picture during the break !, 
  the acoustics are fantastic . 
  it just ended and it was absolutely amazing , 
  this article has been removed for editorializing . 
  op , you are officially warned . 
  use the original article 's title word for word or as closely translated as possible . 
  anything else is not acceptable and will result in a ban if done repeatadly, 
  so folks , normally meta posts get nuked on sight . 
  but this has generated a lot of discussion so i will leave it up myself . 
  if other mods disagree and remove it , they would be perfectly correct to do so . 
  still , please use / r/europemeta if you want mods to answer your questions . 
  i play it . 
  not hardcore . 
  go out for a walk occasionally . 
  fight a bit . 
  catch a couole of ~ ~ rare pokemon ~ ~ pidgeys and come back . 
  done like that it is super fun !, 
  jesus h. christ folks . 
  this is not the bloody thread to discuss immigrants , sweden or refugees . 
  i have handed out bans for this bs . 
  anyone else wants more , be my guest . 
  while there are all terrible , my go-to example is actually khmer rouge . 
  these people managed to kill 25 fucking percent of their total population in less than 5 years . 
  a genocidal war against laos would not have killed as many people . 
  they were a better murder machine on their own people than any foreign invader could have been . 
  they had literal mountain of skulls and special baby-smashing trees . 
  that 's `` true communism '' . 
  edit : i actually did a brief google search to make sure my `` 20 % '' and `` under a decade '' numbers were n't exaggerated and nope , actually , underestimated . 
  it 's 25 % and a bit more than 4 years . 
  absolutely disgusting . 
  nobody is worshipping him . 
  a greek hero of independence , kolokotronis , literally massacred an entire town . 
  but he was still important and we still benefited massively from his existence . 
  that is what that statue says . 
  the world would not be the same without him . 
  yeah , of not treating well spanish colonists lol . 
  ... sure buddy, 
  he simply did a common thing in his time . 
  he did n't invent anything . 
  just because he did it in a new continent ( that he did n't even know was a new continent ) means squat . 
  except that none of what you said is true . 
  columbus simply discovered the americans . 
  he went around , tried to build a couple of colonies , fought a few natives and died . 
  he established no `` regime '', 
   in any case , as to abide to the rules of the sub , i 'll start reporting such comments when i encounter them . 
  please do !, 
  circlejerking comments are , indeed , not allowed . 
  usually it 's enough to report the top comment and we will take care of the whole chain if it applies . 
  cheers . 
   is there any reason for your tone ? 
  the `` i can ban you any time i wish '' does n't sound like something a proper moderator would do . 
  i do n't think it 's a tone . 
  i am simply factually explaining why , what you wrote above , is n't correct . 
  i am mod , i can indeed ban you at any time . 
  since i have n't , i obviously do n't think i should do it . 
  my warning is n't fishing for an excuse to ban you because i do n't need one . 
  my apologies if my factual tone came out as aggressive . 
   and i 'm threatened with a ban ? 
  no , you are threatened with nothing . 
  this is a simple warning to not do that again pretty please sugar on top , as it is against the subreddit 's rules . 
  i would never threaten you with anything as that is pointless . 
  i can already ban you any time i so wish . 
  ----- as a side-note , we would , in the past , nuke these and never post a warning . 
  so people never got a warning and then , on the 3rd-4th time , they would receive a ban , they complained they were never warned . 
  think of these warnings as a psa . 
  instead of simply marking one and moving on , i am helping you avoid breaking the rules .
