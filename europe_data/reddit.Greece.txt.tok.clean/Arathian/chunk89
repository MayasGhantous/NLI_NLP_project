   ... and he introduce a race based slavery and took down directly and undirectly a large portion of the american native with him . 
  he certainly did n't introduce it . 
  race based slavery was extremely common back in the old world . 
  europe itself did n't really have slavery because the vatican forbade it ( amongst christians ) but in places like arabia , n. africa , russia etc it was extremely common . 
  it was also common ( and that 's where columbus took it from ) to do it in european colonies in africa ( which did exist in this period , especially by portugal ) .

   lenin is undeserving of that comparation . 
  lenin killed millions of innocent people , started purges and created one of the most genocidal states in history . 
  columbus was a bit racist and discovered some continents .

   i doubt you check the link . 
  i did n't . 
  i did now and my statement was entirely correct . 
  anything you would like to add to it ? 
   it 's not about islamism . 
  while people crying here about purges , usa backed government arrested 500,000 people and supported authoritarian regimes . 
  lol yes it is ? 
  if it was just about authoritarianism , erdogan would be bff 's with the us because he is as authoritarian as you can get without someone shooting him on the streets . 
  i know he is in the us and , yeah , they probably do consider him an asset , not disagreeing . 
  i am mostly arguing against there being evidence of the us directly backing the coup . 
  not even erdogan claimed that afaik . 
  first of all , what most turks believe is not relevant to what actually happened . 
  i did n't ask if that 's what turks believe , i said what 's the proof behind it . 
  -- as for support of previous coups , yes , the us supported secularist coups against governments that tended towards islamism in turkey . 
  as we established , gulen is not a secularist . 
  so why would the us back this coup ? 
  and again , this is not evidence in any way the us backed this coup even if they had backed similar coups in the past ( which they did n't ) . 
  so far you have presented 0 evidence of us involvement . 
  please do n't most low quality memes . 
  please do n't personally attack people even if they are outrageous . 
  simply report them and we will take care of it . 
  this whole shitshow did n't have a single report . 
  i found it by accident . 
  this is an official warning for agenda pushing . 
  next time , you will be banned . 
   backed by usa that is a big claim , any proof ? 
   gulenists are islamist and anti-secular while that is absolutely correct , what the poster above said is that they will use this excuse to purge secularists too , not just gulenists . 
  he did n't say gulenists are secularists . 
  flaired . 
  we post often , just not with our flairs , 
   i have a question : when the europa universalis series begins again , will there be a new call up/sign-up thread being stickied in / r/europe ? 
  of course , 
  er , is there an archive or something from before ? 
  if you are right , i will of course put it back up .

  *** full text *** how big is the world 's appetite for things danish ? 
  foreign audiences have already binge-watched the country 's noir tv series ( such as `` the killing '' and `` the bridge '' ) and raved over the new nordic cuisine of noma , copenhagen 's trend-setting restaurant . 
  this autumn , publishers are testing the limits of the world 's danomania . 
  before the christmas season , at least nine english-language books will come out devoted to explaining the elusive quality of hygge . 
  hygge is difficult to pronounce . 
  it is also tricky to describe . 
  writers have tried `` the art of creating intimacy '' , `` cosiness of the soul '' and `` cocoa by candlelight '' . 
  it is an attitude rather than a recipe , evoking relaxation with close friends or family . 
  many see it as a quintessential element of denmark 's national character . 
  there is some evidence for this : the danes are europe 's biggest consumers of candles , burning through about 6 kilogrammes ( 13 pounds ) per person every year . 
  runner-up austria manages just half that . 
  denmark often leads ( highly subjective ) rankings of the happiest countries , and hygge is being marketed as a way for foreigners to imitate the danes ' balanced , relaxed , egalitarian lifestyle . 
  but not all danes agree . 
  jeppe trolle linnet , an anthropologist at the university of southern denmark , argues that hygge is not the great social leveller it appears . 
  danes dislike acknowledging class differences , but his research finds that the habits of hygge vary by income and social status . 
  for some , hygge is a bottle of burgundy with soft jazz on the hi-fi ; for others it is a can of beer while watching football on telly . 
  worse , different groups are uncomfortable with others ' interpretations of hygge . 
  mr linnet calls it a `` vehicle of social control '' , involving `` a negative stereotyping of social groups who are perceived as unable to create hygge '' . 
  in this , hygge resembles the german quality of gem\u00fctlichkeit , which also implies a sense of cosiness , peace of mind and -- crucially -- social acceptance . 
  and although the desire for communality does encourage social solidarity , it can also mean excluding strangers .
