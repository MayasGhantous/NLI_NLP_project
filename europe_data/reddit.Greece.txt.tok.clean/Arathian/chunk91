  yes , the bioparent is a terrible person who should rot in jail . 
  yes , the mother will have problems due to the rape and should be fully supported economically and mentally but the actual child * did nothing wrong * . 
  aborting it would be punishing the wrong person . 
  no , i mean the god damn belgians . 
  naturally . 
  i completely agree with you . 
  but no need to yell at them . 
  simply report such scum and we will get rid of em for you . 
  yeah it is . 
  and it is unfortunately more common than one would think . 
  we just usually get it on the filter before ya 'll can see it .

  i 'll take a look , and yeah , i was running with the data posted above . 
  since you posted them yesterday , i could n't respond yet because real life unfortunately  edit : right . 
  2 questions in regards to the data : 1 ) first , and probably the most important , are these 48 % * verified * from syria or * declared themselves * from syria ? 
  i ca n't seem to find an explanation inside the page on how they count it but i might be missing be missing it . 
  obviously , it would be advantageous to declare yourself from syria even if you are not , so this is an important question . 
  2 ) of these people , what percentage moved on to the rest of europe ? 
  i assume a rather large percentage did , especially from 2015 's summer ( where the huge influx happened ) . 
  more importantly , what was the nationality distribution of those who moved ? 
  aka , who stayed behind ? 
  my theory is that , since syrians have an actual asylum claim , more managed to move and stay in n. europe , so they disproportionally left greece . 
  if you have data on either , that would really help clarify the situation !, 
  first of all , cut it off , next time you type this type of message , you earn yourself a ban for mod whining . 
  you were already muted in the modmail for similar reasons . 
  second , i am not a mod because i am an infallible human being . 
  i am a mod because i enforce the rules . 
  i have my own opinions and they are irrelevant to whether or not i am a mod and there is nothing shameful about my opinions disagreeing with yours . 
  this is an official warning for mod whining . 
  er , check the rest of the conversation . 
  i am basing these statements directly on a source provided in this very conversation . 
  oh man , if you ever pass by greece , feel free to hit me up . 
  unironically actually . 
  i am not a bad guy . 
  i mean , i was obviously going full on trolling when the whole debacle happened ( although it was n't my initial intend ) but we can have some good ol' times . 
  you damn fyromian :p, 
   also eritrea is an incredibly restrictive dictatorship with an awful human rights record . 
  which is incredibly irrelevant to whether or not the people coming are refugees . 
  literally the majority of the world live in non-democratic systems , ranging from nk to russia . 
  their lives are shit , sure , but they still are n't refugees . 
   the majority of the world is not as bad as iraq/eritrea/afghanistan . 
  i 'm not suggesting we start counting south africans as refugees . 
  but where is the cut off point once you erode the definition ? 
  sa , although richer , is far worse than eritrea on the books . 
  should all saudis get a refugee status ? 
  i am saying 3 things : 1 ) of the immigrants that arrived , 28 % were syrian 2 ) all of the immigrants that arrived have stayed either here or moved to the rest of europe . 
  almost none have gone back as it is very hard to do that . 
  3 ) syrians are more likely to move to n. europe so , if anything , the % of syrian children enrolled in greek schools is probably going to be even lower than 28 % , but at a maximum of 28 % in short , what i am saying is that , even if we do n't know the exact percentage , we know the maximum percentage and it is very low .

   those are arrivals not people in camps . 
  they fact that they arrived does not mean they have also been placed in camps . 
  but that 's exactly what it means . 
  actually , it probably means the opposite . 
  syrians with proof they are syrians are likely to get a successful asylum application in n. europe , so a large chunk ends up leaving greece . 
  then greece is left with either the undocumented immigrants or simply the undesirables . 
  you seem to have the misconception that once we figure out that this person is not syrian they somehow `` vanish '' ? 
  which is a very strange idea , especially considering it is a well known fact we have huge problems with huge swaths of immigrants in the camps .
