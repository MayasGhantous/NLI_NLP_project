  embryos are human and simply in a different development stage , the same way an old man and a baby are both human in different development stages . 
  showing me a picture of an embryo being a bunch of cells and going `` ooooo , that totally does n't look like a human '' is meaningless . 
  humans are extremely diverse in their development . 
  `` a bunch of cells '' looks no more or less like a human than a baby or a 100 year old man does . 
  ------- tl ; dr i support ban on abortion . 
  i am not a religious nutjob . 
  reason is i believe embryos are human . 
  what do you mean ? 
  men are not allowed to have opinions on whether or not embryos are human beings with rights ? 
  i assume women also should not have an opinion on anything men related then ? 
  or is that sexist ?

  it 's an illusion . 
  she had prepared the oven to not hurt the child ( insulated it from the fire ) but geralt had to not know that else he would not feel guilty for killing the baby ... ... which he had to to kill a monster , it 's complicated . 
  got ta love that this is controversial . 
  hey guys : jeremy corbyn is a liar . 
  he has been proven to have lied in the past , all his public actions point to him having lied about this thing too . 
  the point of lying is that what he said he did and what he did do not match .

  this is a warning for personal attacks . 
  yeah , that is correct . 
  plus , mega sujet sounds a lot less sterile than megathread to be honest . 
  this is an official warning for personal attacks .

   have you taken into account to what kind of society this would lead to ? 
  boycotts popping up left and right , answered by new boycotts . 
  we would try to drag our families and friends on our side , start groups on facebook to rally support , heating up the discussions to a point where we just start hating each other . 
  i see no reason any of that would happen . 
  yes , it would sometimes have some controversies , but that 's actually * good * for society . 
  when the boycotts of chick-fil-a happened , it was good for lgbt rights in america , not bad . 
  even if it was state-sanctioned , the retarded ban on transgender people in bathrooms was good for lgbt rights due to the following controversy and so on and so forth . 
  state-mandated non-controversiality only serves to bury issues instead of solving them . 
   again , it 's easy to say that when you 've never been discriminated . 
  you know me personally and know this for a fact ? 
  i * have * been discriminated against . 
  and not the whimpy `` they looked at me the wrong way '' discrimination . 
  i mean real discrimination . 
  you might be surprised to learn that not everyone who does n't share your opinion is a hick who never left his village . 
  so , to bring it back to you , have you ever been discriminated against since you are sooooo knowledgeable of what it is like ? 
   do you think jim crow or apartheid were `` minor inconveniences ? '', 
  i know it 's a stretch to compare this to those two , but these laws are in place to prevent exactly these situations from happening .
