   because religion is something recognized as deeply embedded in the personality of people , whereas political views are not . 
  [ source needed ]  even when trump would disagree , he is neither a deitry , nor is following him any kind of religiouse practice , but it is the expression of participation of the democratic prozess . 
  as a member of the same democratic process , you can deny to do stuff in order to support the other 's party . 
  i mean , i agree i should be able to deny making a trump cake , but i think all private bussinesses should be able to deny services for any and all reasons . 
  so , sure , we agree !, 
   but , one distinct sign of all western culturs is the freedom of religion , actually , we slam the middle eastern nation regularly due to their religiouse intollerance . 
  no western nation has laws specifically targetting islam . 
  private individuals should be able to do as they please as long as they do n't directly physically hurt another person . 
  cutting someone 's hair is not vital . 
   so , by denying service out of religiouse reasons , you show exactly the religiouse intollerance that goes contrary to the freedoms of the others . 
  and believe me , we saw quite a lot how that ends , we had the 30 year war in germany that killed half our people just because different ( christian ) religions did n't accept each other , we had the genozide that was only possible by demonizing the jews in the first place , and denying services was part of this process . 
  no , there ca n't be discrimination due to religion , or we have n't learn anything in the past centuries . 
  i think blind acceptance of religious intollerance in the name of religious tollerance will only lead to a repetition of the 30 years war ( or something along those lines ) , not stop them . 
  a hijab is a brazen declaration that you do n't care about a western country 's culture or for your intergration within it . 
  this . 
  labour 's bullshitting . 
  labour currently has actually a rather large advantage when it comes to seat distribution ( basically , there are smaller and more seats in places that heavily support labour ) . 
  this change will not make the conservatives better than labour , it will simply correct the bias towards labour in the seat distribution . 
  last time i checked you are n't born with a hijab either . 
  so , to go back to the original : why should they be penalized if not penalizing the person who refused to make a trump cake is ok ? 
  yeah . 
  modern english is basically closer to french than older english . 
  it 's way more similar than that . 
  a better comparison would be , hmmm , between english and french actually !, 
  it 's not the same language any more but you can clearly see heavy similarities in a ton of stuff . 
  if anything , ancient greek is closer to modern greek than english is to french though !, 
  modern greek is a direct evolution of ancient greek and we can , essentially , completely trace back all the changes . 
  ancient greek * is * very different from modern greek when it comes to words , less so when it comes to grammar ( as fwipyok correctly pointed out ) . 
  the main thing is that greek was severely affected by latin over the years and many of our words have changed because of that . 
  but yes , given patience , an ancient greek could talk to a modern greek .

  the vast majority of greeks do care about macedonia . 
  we just do n't have it at the top of the priority list . 
  do n't confuse the two . 
  it 's like saying greeks do n't care about education because it 's not our primary subject right now . 
  edit : actually , reading the rest of your posts , never mind . 
  you are obviously extremely misinformed on the subject . 
  no point in trying to discuss this with you when you are probably saying these stuff for ideological reasons rather than any connection to reality . 
   alexander was illyrian where do you people get your history from ? 
  even a brief google search could prove you wrong . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_the_great  alexander the great ( greek : \u1f08\u03bb\u03ad\u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f41 \u039c\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2 , al\u00e9xandros ho m\u00e9gas [ a.l\u00e9k.san.dros ho m\u00e9.gas ] ) , was a king ( basileus ) of the ancient greek kingdom of macedon [ a ] and a member of the argead dynasty . 
  geee , argead dynasty , let 's google that !, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/argead_dynasty  the argead dynasty ( greek : \u1f08\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9 ) was an ancient greek royal house . 
  they were the ruling dynasty of macedon from about 700 to 310 bc . 
  ** their tradition , as described in ancient greek historiography , traced their origins to argos , in southern greece , hence the name argeads or argives ** and  the words `` argead '' and `` argive '' derive ( via latin arg\u012bvus [ 7 ] ) from the greek \u1f08\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2 ( argeios ) , `` of or from argos '' , [ 8 ] and is first attested in homer , where it was also used as a collective designation for the greeks ( '' \u1f08\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u0394\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u1ff6\u03bd '' , argive danaans ) . 
  [ 9 ] [ 10 ] the argead dynasty claimed descent from the temenids of argos , in the peloponnese can we please stop this bullshit misinformation everyone ? 
  it 's getting tiring . 
  sure , but much like any mixing ever , it was n't on a scale where we can claim there has n't been continuity over the ages in the greek populace . 
  turks in anatolia today probably are closer to the macedonians than people in fyrom , ironically . 
  maybe turkey should rename itself to macedonia . 
  would n't even be mad . 
  please just report people like him . 
  also please report them . 
  varoufakis is a clown , a liar and i would n't trust anything that comes out of his mouth . 
  do n't do the same mistake so many of my fellow countrymen did . 
  that said , germany is failing in its leading role in the eu , that much is clear after the disasters of grexit , brexit and the refugee crisis . 
  and yes , germany is leading ; anyone who denies that is blind . 
   but why not send them back to the border in this case ? 
  because the other countries would not accept them . 
  simple as that really . 
  my personal preference would have been pan-eu un-style refugee city camps in a guarded area in syria . 
  like how it worked with other conflicts in the past . 
  however , for a temporary processing of migrants , an organized camp would work . 
   or grant them asylum ? 
  two reasons . 
  firstly , the majority of the people in calais do not qualify for asylum . 
  many are from stable nations and are economic migrants , not refugees . 
  second , they literally do n't want to do that . 
  they flat out refuse and demand entrance in the uk instead . 
  yes , it 's absurd , but it 's true . 
   what i mean is there sure are better options than detention camp long term yeah . 
  but short term no ; or at least , none i can think of . 
  all feedback is welcome , of course . 
   but they did n't do anything wrong they are illegally in a foreign country without proper documentation in their person . 
  that 's at least 2 things wrong . 
  well , the troubles were a terrible and traumatic period of n. ireland and britain in general . 
  that the past 2 years we are having terrorist attacks to equal those is not good news ...
