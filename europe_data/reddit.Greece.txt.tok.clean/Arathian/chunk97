  no personal attacks . 
  in zakynthos currently . 
  comfy yes , but it 's basically a touch cooler than a volcano . 
  man remember grexit ? 
  at some point , a day before the voting , i was so genuinely pissed off in reddit that i cut off the internet and actually went outside . 
  that was a horrible day . 
  i still have no idea how i was n't banned . 
  all of greece feels like that during a heat wave . 
  crete specifically is great though . 
  but yes , they are rednecks . 
  it 's not a real island but the name is the greek word for sun !, 
  if there are , i sure have n't heard em . 
  `` it 's icky '' is n't an argument . 
  i am an avowed atheist and against abortion . 
  there are secular arguments for that whether you like it or not . 
  huh ? 
  i sure have n't . 
  if you read / r/ukpolitics , a lot of tory members there quite dislike how weak labour is . 
  opposition is supposed to moderate the government and not all torries are 100 % on board with all torry policies . 
  however , i would n't be surprised if corbyn received secret conservative funding . 
  the hell ... so uk should n't defend british citizens who overwhelmingly want to remain british citizens from an invading dictatorship ? 
  in what world is that ethical or admirable ?

  this is an official warning . 
  the main problem , according to the article , seems to be that , because they helped the immigrants , more came and the publicity they received meant tourists no longer wanted to come to the island which killed tourism . 
  up to 30 is easily tolerable to be honest . 
  you have n't experienced hell till you experience 45 degrees in athens .

  and who gets to decide who bans what ? 
  the government ? 
  what happens when trump , le pen or ukip get in power and are allowed to do that ? 
  i mean , i do n't believe they are fascist or evil or whatever it is you believe , but even if they were , what you suggest would be flat out wrong , morally and as a solution . 
  do n't ever promote stuff without consulting the mods first .
