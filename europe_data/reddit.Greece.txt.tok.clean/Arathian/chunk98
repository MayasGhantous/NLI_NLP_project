  i need to consult fellow mods first as this was manually removed by a mod . 
  we are a team after all . 
  if the original was off-topic , then this should be too ( in theory ) . 
  i checked . 
  it was apparently removed .

  yeah . 
  i was talking about homes too  i have 5 different acs in my house currently lol . 
  the average temp inside the house is about 25 degrees . 
  yeah , athens can reach 50 + with humidity , especially during this period . 
  ach well . 
  i guess i am too used to that . 
  i basically walk from air-conditioned rooms to air-conditioned rooms to the beach . 
  the above post has been reported twice . 
  google translate does n't help . 
  could you provide a brief translation ? 
   we do n't have ac here eithe i mean , i feel you about the general heat but holy fuck , no ac ? 
  i assume morocco is similar to greece weather wise . 
  that 's insane . 
  i ban people who break the rules . 
  i tagged you 3 different times for 3 different insults . 
  a 4th one will result in a long ban . 
  not sources , people . 
  and yes , if we have a huge thread about some right wing person and he personally writes a response in rt or something , we will allow it . 
   white trash white trash is a racist term . 
  do n't use it . 
  this is an official warning . 
  we do n't though . 
  i mean , i am sure you think we do , but you would be wrong . 
  that 's not cool either . 
  calm down with the stereotypes . 
  use the report button instead . 
  no personal attacks . 
  this is an official warning . 
  no personal attacks . 
  i did that one . 
  do n't go overboard again . 
  you already had a ban over this stuff , next one will be longer . 
  no low effort , circlejerk memes . 
  this is an official warning . 
  you are veeeery close to getting a ban lad . 
  a few things : 1 ) the previous post in / r/europe was not from dailymail , as that source is auto-removed for being a bad source , plain and simple . 
  it was ibtimes which is considered a credible source . 
  the imam in the article responds to the dailymail post ( which i have personally not read ) . 
  2 ) normally , the source op posted is not credible . 
  however , this article is written directly by a person that had a large thread on / r/europe , so in * this specific case * , we will allow it . 
  so yes , it stays , reports are on auto-ignore for the article . 
  3 ) we will not be flairing this . 
  whether it is misleading or not is up to debate and any action on our part would be political . 
  we do n't do political modding . 
  4 ) i have been lenient so far in this thread . 
  that ends now . 
  any further slapfighting will result in bans . 
  behave . 
  5 ) if you want to comment on the moderation of this subreddit , please use / r/europemeta or respond to this post . 
  any further meta comments will be removed . 
  please comment on the article . 
  thanks and cheers . 
  because dm is a shit source and autoremoved . 
  but ibtimes is creddible . 
  i do n't think removing it is appropriate . 
  we are already accused of censorship as is . 
  no low effort shitposts pretty please with sugar on top . 
  maybe under british law as it is very draconian . 
  in my opinion , you should n't be . 
  i strongly believe the us standards of free speech are a golden standard,

   russians are insane as a reminder , biggotry towards an entire group of people , that includes russians , is forbidden . 
  you can criticize cultures . 
  `` they are all insane '' is not that . 
  this is an official warning .
