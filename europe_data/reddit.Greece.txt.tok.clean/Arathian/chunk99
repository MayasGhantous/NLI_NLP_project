  veils in public places , turning hagia sophia back into a mosque for a few days , the persecution of a religious sect right now ( yes , gulen is bad . 
  it still is religious persecution ) etc you are no syria but the country has a very clear tendency of erroding its secularism right now . 
  you got a president who has a hard on against secularism . 
  that 's always a bad sign . 
  on a more practical note , the veil is now allowed in public places ( such as school ) which was traditionally a big taboo in turkish secularist ttadition . 
  yeah , and they were both correct . 
  almost like belonging to a political space is irrelevant to whether what you are saying is wrong or not !, 
  aye , but the main focus of the article is on the torrent site , not europe . 
  so basically , it is off-topic . 
  your article is focused on europe and piracy so it is on topic .

   are you shilling for big piracy ? 
  yes, 
  i am getting paid by holywood as of yesterday too . 
  that adds it amongst my payments from saudi arabia , merkel , golden dawn , russia , turkey , the socialist internationale and the american nazi party .

  i do n't think you can reply to removed comments . 
  i mean , if you can , go for it . 
  no personal attacks . 
  also calm down in general . 
  this is a formal warning . 
  it 's honestly to be expected . 
  much of europe is in that spot between being rich enough to own an electronic device that can connect to the internet ( such as a pc or a smartphone ) but not rich enough to be able to regularly buy media sold in the west . 
  thus piracy !, 
  yes , but this has 1 upvote and 6 comments while the other got 20 comments and quite a few more upvotes . 
  i mean , you are 100 % correct ( which is the sorry part of my removal ) but in the end of the day , the whole point of posting articles is to have a discussion and only the other thread had that .

  his post was removed for a different , correct reason . 
  specifically , he had linked to banned sources . 
  do note this post is up ( i approved it ) . 
  just like ... avoid the word really when refering to other people . 
  only ends up in yelling matches . 
  today yes . 
  during varoufakis ' era no . 
  syriza used to be a far left party . 
  it 's radical wing left after the referendum . 
  today it is pasok 2.0 , but that was not always the case . 
  calm it down folks . 
  you can disagree without calling each other retards .
