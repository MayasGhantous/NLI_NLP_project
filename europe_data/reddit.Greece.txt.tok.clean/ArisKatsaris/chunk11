  discrimination against some beliefs is perfectly okay . 
   `` discrimination : the unjust or prejudicial treatment of different categories of people , especially on the grounds of race , age , or sex . '', 
  if you * define * discrimination as something inherently something injust ( not the definition i would use ) then you 'd have to argue that something is injust before calling it discrimination -- but right now you 've been doing the opposite and treating something as unjust * because * you already consider it discrimination . 
   the same guy that tries to convince people that hating on islam is ok because they 're muslims no , i did n't say that 's the reason it 's ok to hate on islam . 
  if you want my own opinion , hating on islam is ok because islam is a false belief-system and a set of oppressive practices based on the supposed commands of a non-existent god . 
  hating on christianity , judaism , etc , is likewise okay for the same reasons . 
  only difference is that those religions have been already mostly defanged of political power , and islam has n't . 
   most muslims do n't . 
  which means that not all people you group under the label ` muslims ' have actually the same faith , the same religious beliefs , the same religion . 
  some ` muslims ' believe in a religion where it 's not okay to murder gays , and some ` muslims ' believe in a religion where it 's okay to murder gays . 
  are you saying that we should discriminate between those two religions , or that we should n't ? 
  careful here . 
  if we * should * discriminate between those religious beliefs , then you 're agreeing that some religious beliefs are better than others . 
  if we should n't discriminate between them , you just excused those people who treat all ` muslims ' the same . 
   yeah , odd how other imams or people like muhammad ali and malcom x did n't kill gays , huh ? 
  not only they did n't kill gays , they probably did n't think killing gays was okay either . 
  so you 're saying they did n't have the same religious beliefs as the people who say it 's okay to kill gays ? 
  i agree . 
  if you live in the us or western europe , the dominant religion of our society is egalitarianism , and ` discrimination ' is the primary sin . 
  you called a man ` discriminating ' and that was supposed to make us gasp in horror at his crime of ` discrimination ' ? 
  like calling someone ` heretic ' , or ` counterrevolutionary ' , some insults are only insults if other people already share your ideology . 
  egalitarianism is a much more benign religion that most others , but it has its own absurdities as i said . 
   it 's not ok to discriminate people for their religion if my religion said it was obligatory to murder people for being gay , and i actively followed the tenets of said religions , then you should definitely discriminate against me . 
   you assume that discriminating people for their culture and religion is ok . and you assume that it does n't . 
  but frankly that belief of yours is * shallow * , because you have the absurd privilege of living in a society where most religions have been defanged of power : when 's the last time that you saw aztecs make human sacrifice to their gods ? 
  when 's the last time you saw jewish people stone adulterers ? 
  when 's the last time you saw christians burn a heretic or hang a witch ? 
  and living in a society that in generations past * defeated * all those absurd practices of * religions * , you have the privilege of criticizing those who still attack the religions who * have n't * yet abolished all their own barbaric practices . 
  so are you , you are obviously discriminating against people who attack specific religions . 
   if you make a movie that 's actively attacking a specific religion , that 's discriminating on religion and that makes you a discriminating , hate-mongering prick it 's funny to see the level of self-contradictory insanity that your own religion has imbued you with . 
  some religions * are * explicitely systems of discrimination ( and some religions more so than others ) . 
  by your own argument if you attack systems of discrimination , that 's itself discrimating on discrimination , and that makes you attackers of discrimination `` discriminating , hate-mongering pricks '' . 
   kosovo is same as crimea except that there is us base instead of russian . 
  another major difference is that the serbs had already made themselves hated before the kosovo war , because of their own attempts to carve up bosnia & croatia . 
  so nobody gave a shit about serbia 's territorial integrity , because serbia had already failed to respect the territorial integrity of its neighbors . 
  ukraine has committed no such crime against any of its neighbors , no acts of aggression whatsoever -- so it gets sympathy from the rest of the world . 
  i doubt it 'll * manage * to destroy the eu , but greece will certainly give it its best try . 
  as i 've noted already a few times , and you 've been studiously ignoring , the publication of the european council on foreign relations on eu-russia relations ( http://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/a_power_audit_of_eu_russia_relations ) also calls greece a `` trojan horse of russia '' , so it 's not as if i 'm saying anything new . 
   if greece has been taken over by russophiles , then how come it 's been on the western side of geopolitics since 1821 ? 
  why are you going back two centuries , when my own argument has only been about events been happening in the last three decades or so ? 
  i 've never denied that greece had western-friendly governments ( both dictatorships and democratic ones ) in the further past . 
  as for ` western side of geopolitics ' , does your question translate to `` why are we still part of nato & the eu , if russophiles are ruling us ? '', 
  first of all , until tsipras , all the earlier russophile pms would n't have their parties ' agreement for an exit from eu or nato . 
  those parties were to a large extent composed by a mixture of western-friendly democrats and of chauvinists , not of russophiles . 
  as for why it remains in eu and nato still under tsipras , the phrase ` trojan horse of russia ' i think covers it . 
  in alexander dugin 's lecture in piraeus ( http://www.4pt.su/en/content/international-politics-and-eurasianist-vision ) `` professor dugin finally spoke on the role of greece in today 's europe claiming that it is much more important if greece contributes to the recreation of the architecture of europe by reinforcing the eastern european pole inside the eu than if greece joins the eurasian union . '', 
  so basically even the most prominent russian fascist ideologue around ( invited to do his lecture by the current greek fm kotzias ) effectively states out loud that greece is more useful to russia inside the european union , rather than joining the eurasian union instead . 
   even if the video is true , i do n't see how it proves anything about the `` evil russophiles taking over the government and only mitsotakis can stand up to them but unfortunately he was attacked by evil russophiles karamanlis and samaras '' first of all , i never said `` only mitsotakis can stand up to them '' . 
  in fact i did n't say that he stood up to them at all . 
  that he was not in their pocket does n't mean that he was bravely opposing them or anything like that . 
  as for whether it ` proves ' something about the russophiles , i never claimed that it ` proves ' anything by itself either . 
  no single fact ever proves anything by itself . 
  i expect you however to see as the * evidence * that it is , even if it 's not by itself conclusive . 
  if you keep your ears and eyes open instead of shutting them and loudly humming to yourself whenever someone mentions such evidence , eventually the evidence will indeed become overwhelming . 
  in the 1990s i was also highly sceptical of arguments about russophile infiltration in greece . 
  but eventually the evidence for such in greece became overwhelming and i could no longer deny them . 
  and as already mentioned , it 's not even as if it 's my conclusion alone : the `` power audit of eu-russia relations '' , a publication of the european council on foreign relations ( http://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/a_power_audit_of_eu_russia_relations ) also came to the conclusion since 2007 that greece acted like a trojan horse of russia inside the eu . 
   as for the video , i was unable to find anyone else reporting on it . 
   oh great , quoting far-right nutjob websites . 
  seriously ? 
  seriously ? 
  you called me ` completely crazy ' for stating true facts that i have now provided a video for ( and which you could have easily googled yourself ) , and now instead of apologizing for that insult , you now have the audacity of complaining about the political orientation of one of the links i found ? 
  is this what passes for integrity with you ? 
   it all makes sense now . 
  lol , did you just imply that i 'm far-right ? 
  i linked you to a page that openly loves russia , while i * despise * russia , and from that you got that i 'm supposedly far-right ? 
  fyi , i consider myself a progressive social democrat , that 's why i despise russia and support the eu , ( while both the far-right and the far-left adore russia and hate the eu ) . 
   are all leftists part of some sort of botnet that the hidden russophiles control ? 
  it was n't ` all leftists ' that participated in the task of disrupting parades . 
  why do n't you ask such a leftist protester why they did n't protest in alexandroupoli in that year , when they protested everywhere else ? 
  they 'll be more familiar with who gives them their marching orders . 
  but since you have n't yet even acknowledged that russians did in fact parade , something that i already provided a video for , facts available to us all , rather than this being a ` crazy ' claim of mine , i do n't think we 're ready to discuss the finer details of how the leftist squads are directed to their targets , which i do not know . 
   you are completely crazy . 
  russian troops do not participate in greek parades . 
  http://www.defencegreece.com/index.php/2011/10/russian-marines-parading-in-alexandroupolis-video/ `` just a few kilometers from the border the two largest orthodox armies , the greek and the russian , has just joined and marched for the first time together in the same parade , thrilling thousands of residents of the remote city of alexandroupolis '' it has video . 
  do please also note that this parade , was the * only * one that day that was n't disrupted by leftist protesters in the whole of greece . 
  here 's also one about russians parading in lemnos : http://www.defencenet.gr/defence/o/56966 they were also going to [ parade in salonica ] ( http://www.prisonplanet.gr/%cf%81%cf%89%cf%83%ce%b9%ce%b1-%ce%b7%cf%80%ce%b1/1185-%cf%84%ce%bf-%cf%81%cf%89%cf%83%ce%b9%ce%ba%cf%8c-%d0%bd%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%be%d1%87%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%ba%d0%b0%d1%81%d1%81%d0%ba-%cf%83%cf%84%ce%b7-%ce%b8%ce%b5%cf%83%cf%83%ce%b1%ce%bb%ce%bf%ce%bd%ce%af%ce%ba%ce%b7 ) but in regards to that one it seems at the end they were only allowed to parade separately , not join the official parade . 
   yes , as i said i completely agree with you that the rant above about the `` evil russophilles '' and the `` glorious mitsotakides '' is ridiculous . 
  yes , even when the government allows the russian army to march in national parades , some people are still determined to see no russophiles , hear no russophiles . 
  in greece it 's only politically acceptable ( even obligatory ) to bash people for being subservient to foreign interests only when those foreign interests are supposedly european , american , or israeli . 
  heavens forbid that someone speaks about * russian foreign interests * pulling the strings , then you 're just being ridiculous . 
  even though it 's not american , european or israeli armies that are allowed to participate in our parades , it 's only the russian ones . 
  i really wonder , if you do n't believe in the existence of russophilia ( or even russian-subservience ) in our former pms what do * you * guys believe is the connecting link between karamanlis and samaras ? 
  why did karamanlis bring samaras back to the party and support him against dora bakoyanni , if not for the fact that the both of them belonged to the russian geopolitical camp , and dora bakoyanni did n't ? 
  as for mitsotakis , the only thing i said in his favour was that his period of governance was `` one of the healthiest economically in modern greek history '' . 
  given how abysmal all the other periods of governance in modern greek history were , that 's hardly glorious praise . 
  if you disagree with that assessment of mine , please rank greek governments since the fall of junta according to their economic performance and tell me where the mitsotakis government ranks according to you . 
   you keep using the word `` russophile '' a lot . 
  no one in power in greece in the last 30 years was a `` russophile '' . 
  a power audit of eu relations ( 2007 ) : http://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/a_power_audit_of_eu_russia_relations '' ... the authors identify five distinct categories of countries . 
  greece and cyprus are referred to as ` trojan horses ' whose governments often defend positions close to russian interests , and who have been willing to veto common eu positions . '', 
  can you please explain to me this evaluation by this report , if there has n't been any russophile in position of power in greece ` in the last 30 years ' ? 
   samaras did nothing to apease the russians let 's ignore for the sec all the ways that he supported the investments of russians ( and chinese ) , and let 's see the acts of symbolism he has partaken in : he made his party a ` sister party ' to putin 's `` united russia '' . 
  he allowed the russian * army * to participate in the military parades for greek national holidays . 
  forgive me if i 'm forgetting something , but has any greek prime minister allowed americans , brits , or any of our other nato allies to participate in a national military parade ? 
  did n't samaras allow something to the russian army that none of our official nato allies would ever be allowed to do ? 
  on more practical matters , he allowed the ( fanatically russophile ) neonazi gang of golden dawn to grow into power . 
   karamanlis did almost nothing to apease the russians ( an oil pipe plan that came to naught ) one of his very first acts as leader of the party was to expel from it practically every western-friendly leading figure ( manos , souflias , kontogianopoulos ) , and he brought back samaras who was the chief supporter of the ` orthodox axis ' of greece-serbia-russia during the 1990s . 
  besides that , practically everything else he did as pm , from vetoing fyr macedonia 's membership in nato ( despite the earlier signed agreements between greece and fyr macedonia that prohibited such ) to cooperating with the communist party in mayoral elections , to military agreements with russia , to well , the bankruptcy of greece itself ... ... is there * anything * karamanlis did that can be said to have failed to support russian interests in one way or another ? 
   all our military equipment with the exception of a part of the air defence ( s-300 ) is either european or american .
