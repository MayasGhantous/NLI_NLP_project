  after the cold war ended in 1989-1992 , the two geopolitical centers in the continent have been brussels and moscow . 
  all the progressive democratic ideologies , liberal and socialdemocratic both are aligned with brussels , even as right-wing and left-wing fascists alike are now both aligned with moscow ( unlike what was occurring during the cold war ) . 
  so frankly , eu is the best friend of democracy and accountability across the european continent , when all the fascist lackeys of the kremlin despise it . 
   whenever a terrorist attack happens , the left , quite rightly , say not to blame islam for the actions of radicals . 
  i 'm a pro-eu social-democrat , so `` leftist '' according to some , but i definitely believe that we should blame lies for all the actions justified by those lies . 
  when absurdities are what is used to motivate atrocities , then the absurdities are to blame . 
  so , yeah , we should blame islam for islamic terrorism , as we should blame antisemetic lies for auschwitz , as we should blame anti-eu lies for this murder here . 
  you can look at the history of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:supranational_european_bodies-en.svg niknaks made the first version , but i am the one who made the drastic redesign on 31 december 2014 ( it used to be this : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/archive/1/1a/20141231214013%21supranational_european_bodies-en.svg , and i made it like this : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/archive/1/1a/20141231221303%21supranational_european_bodies-en.svg , and the minor subsequent fixes ) another one i redesigned was https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:supranational_american_bodies.svg if you want ones i 've made from scratch ( except of course reusing the flags that others made ) , there 's the images at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/template:supranational_islamic_bodies https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:africanorgs-diagram.svg and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/template:supranational_postsoviet_bodies, 
  i made that one !, 
   massive reform of its public sector , and greece says `` no '' to such reform , so what can the eu do about it , and therefore how is the eu to blame for it ? 
   not just this , greece was treated shamefully by the eu ; no it was n't . 
  it was greece that treated shamefully both itself and the eu . 
  there 's nothing remotely shameful about anything that the eu did towards greece . 
   such as ? 
  well let 's take them one by one shall we ? 
  ** fyrom : ** most countries in the world use just `` republic of macedonia '' . 
  the name `` former yugoslav republic of macedonia '' was a solution that the eu nations brought forward , and which currently mostly eu nations use -- if you see the red portions of the map ( the countries that use fyrom for all official purposes ) at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonia_naming_dispute#naming_policies_of_foreign_countries_and_organisations you 'll see the european portion with a few exceptions ( like uk ) to be the map of the eu as it was in 1992 . 
  the reason greeks do n't think the eu supported us because greece had the absurd absolutist position that there should be neither noun nor adjective deriving from the term `` macedonia '' at all . 
  this was so absurd that no country in the world could support us , and indeed none did . 
  ** turkey : ** our mere membership helps defend against turkish aggression . 
  same with cyprus -- its eu membership is a tremendous boost to its physical security from turkish aggression . 
  if you do n't see this to be the case , then imagine how angry russia would be if we let ukraine or georgia join up as members of the eu -- because attacking them would then have much worse consequences for them . 
  could it do more against turkish aggression . 
  sure . 
  the eu could also have done more against serbian aggression against its neighbours , or against russian aggression against its neighbours . 
  but it 's not doing nothing either . 
  ** immigration issue ** : we have received officers from eu countries , we have received funds from the eu ( e.g. 
  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/02/refugee-crisis-europe-eu-countries-greece-receive-700m-extra-aid-funds ) . 
  what greek establishment objects to is that the eu counties did n't open their borders to receive hundreds of thousands of middle-eastern immigrants . 
  so again it depends whether you desire to reduce the immigration crisis , or to instead spread the crisis to other countries . 
  greek government complains because other countries helped us in * reducing * the overall immigration crisis . 
   romania and poland blocked our borders . 
  yes , we should be thanking them for that . 
  eu countries closing their own borders , since we could not defend our own , was part of the necessary solution to the immigration crisis . 
  no immigrant wants to stay to greece , therefore if they ca n't proceed to europe , they do n't have any reason to come here in the first place . 
  the immigration crisis reached its height in 2015 , because it was then that the new greek government instead of * hindering * immigration , started promising immigrants that they would be transported to europe , and indeed was itself helping transporting them from the islands to our northern borders , where we were demanding that other countries would open their own borders to let them in . 
  `` they wanted to defend their borders , so we should are fine with russia threatening them militarily '' is an absurd imperialist position . 
  nothing in the eu treaties demands the acceptance of third-world immigrants by any eu nation . 
  they do demand solidarity in the face of armed aggression though . 
  ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/glossary/mutual_defence.html ) . 
   a mere look at how the council votes would tell you as much . 
  what am i supposed to be seeing in that table ? 
  that germany has almost 8 times the population of greece , but less than 3 times the votes ? 
   the eu has n't supported us in the refugee crisis , against turkey , fyrom or pretty much any other way . 
  oh , really ? 
  perhaps you missed all the hundreds of billions of euros they 've been handing out to us over the last few decades , and again over the last few years . 
  and yes , the eu actually supported greece to a * reasonable * extent in all of these issues . 
  perhaps you missed it , because you do n't count it as `` support '' unless it 's to an unreasonable extent . 
  as for how we 've been repaying them , we 've been repaying europe by supporting putin , literally having our pm stand by his side , while he militarily threatens countries like poland and romania . 
  we 've been repaying europe by repeatedly attempting extortion against them , and by slandering them and calling * them * extortioners and loansharks . 
   it 's a great idea in theory , but in practice it 's a mix of a free for all and a german hegemony . 
  cute , we pretend it 's a `` germany hegemony '' when all the countries are allied with germany against greece , in order to present ourselves as brave dissenters and the other countries as puppets . 
  but then on the immigration issue greece and germany were allied against the other countries , and germany did not have its way ... and then we were insulting every other country for daring to oppose german . 
  how can it be a hegemony when germany so often does n't have its way ? 
  europe did nothing when russia split off transnistria from moldova ( because who cares about moldova ) . 
  europe did nothing when russia slaughtered chechnya . 
  ( because it was within russia 's internationally recognized borders , and we respected their right to kill as massacre of their own citizens as they liked ) europe did nothing when russia effectively stole abkhazia and south ossetia from georgia , in the process promoting the ethnic cleansing of 250,000 georgians from abkhazia . 
  ( because we 're just that big idiots ) finally , on the third country russia attempts to carve pieces out of , europe finally puts some * minimal * economic sanctions on him , and removes him from the g8 . 
  then he 's not a muslim , he 's a former muslim , which is kinda the * opposite * of being a muslim . 
   is n't `` balkan '' typically used to describe those states which were part of yugoslavia no . 
  when used as an adjective in the sense of `` the greek language '' , \u03b9t would have its singular feminine form and end with eta , like this : '' \u03b7 \u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03b3\u03bb\u03ce\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 '' . 
  but when used like a noun ( e.g. 
  `` do you speak greek ? '' ), 
  it would take a plural form and therefore end with alpha ( '' \u039c\u03b9\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2 \u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac ; '' ), 
  your own comment displayed the belief that somehow gay rights is about ` pleasing the us and gb ' . 
  if you claim they 're only doing gay pride marches to please us and gb , then i can certainly believe ( with greater justification than you ) , that you 're only made that comment , because the russian state media feed you such bullshit all the time . 
  do tell me , where did you get the idea that gay rights are about pleasing us and gb ? 
  you should figure out the irony of saying `` you should have as much rights as your government gave it to you '' and at the same time using the word ` dictatorship ' for those who disagree with you . 
   it is a dictatorship of the one opinion you seem very confused . 
  `` gay pride '' marches are voluntary . 
  people participate in order to declare themselves proud to be gay , and also non-gay people who support the aforementioned . 
  so where 's the ` dictatorship ' in these marches ? 
  it would certainly be tyranny if you were forced to join in these marches against your will , but you 're not . 
  there exist gay people ( and supporters of gay people ) across the world , not just in the `` us and gb '' . 
  if the us and gb are pleased by countries upholding gay rights , that 's praiseworthy for the us and gb . 
  it 's praiseworthy to be pleased by countries that support rights . 
  sameways that it 's damnable to be pleased by countries that violate them . 
  why is n't the support of gay rights by kosovo pleasing russia same way it pleases all good nations ? 
  when russia becomes a worthier nation it will be pleased by such support too . 
  so when you say `` christians do not seek an earthly kingdom '' you do n't mean actual existing christians who historically very much did seek earthly kingdoms ?

   would you not rate any of a brief history of time by stephen hawking highly then ? 
  i do n't understand by what definition of ` entertaining ' you would consider it non-entertaining and yet at the same time rate it highly . 
  that having been said it 's been two decades since i read it , and i do n't remember the book clearly enough for me to judge it . 
   however , i doubt that you can make me change my mind . 
  i simply do not fancy this song as much as the rest of europe apparently does . 
  i 've not attempted to make you change your mind about the song . 
  frankly , i have n't even heard the song yet and so have no opinion on it . 
  what i 'm attempting to do is try to untangle the confusion of words that you 're throwing at me and figure out how you 're using words like ` entertaining ' . 
  with all these long paragraphs i felt you were trying to express something beyond `` i did n't think it a very well-made song '' , but i 've not figure out what that meaning you 're trying to communicate to me is yet . 
  whatever you 're saying seems to be very muddled and confused , and i do n't know what point you 're trying to make . 
   would you rate a song highly if it only has a message and is n't brought in a fun or entertaining way ? 
  i would n't rate a book highly either if it only `` has a message '' either , if it was n't brought about in a good , interesting way , so i do n't understand again what distinction you 're trying to make between songs and books . 
  i do n't know what you mean `` fun or entertaining way '' either , and how you mean them . 
  is [ losing my religion ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwtdhwltsig ) ` entertaining ' ? 
  how about [ who by fire ? ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqtrx23emnk ) ? 
  or [ the sound of silence ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zlfcngvel4 ) ? 
  or [ twist in my sobriety ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfd4uhg1fai ) ? 
  these are all grim songs , dealing with grim topics . 
  i rate all of them very highly .
