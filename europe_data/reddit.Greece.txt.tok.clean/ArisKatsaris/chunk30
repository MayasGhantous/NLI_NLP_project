  calling them `` fun or entertaining '' is probably not quite the word i 'd use , but i love them all . 
  the eu wants a voluntary union built on equality , human rights and the respect for diversity , which every country is free to join and free to leave . 
  good people hate hitler for invading other countries , massacring people , wanting to enslave other nations . 
  evil people on the other hand think that the problem with hitler was that he wanted a ` superstate ' . 
  they do n't even care about that whether the superstate is voluntary or coerced because evil people do n't give a dam about consent vs coercion . 
  boris johnson is evil . 
   besides , a book is meant to be read for its message . 
  sometimes movies are just for fun . 
  sometimes they are for their message . 
  sometimes books are just for fun . 
  sometimes they are for their message . 
  sometimes songs are just for fun . 
  sometimes they are for their message . 
  it 's probably because in the 21st century russia finds it popular to invade neighbouring countries and steal their territories . 
  first moldova , then georgia , then ukraine , and then every other country that voted against you in eurovision most likely . 
  would you have that rule also for movies and books , that they ca n't win awards if they have a political message ? 
  the doctor/parents assign gender based on external characteristics ( also known as `` presence of penis '' vs `` presence of vagina '' ) . 
  people with gender dysphoria have a discrepancy between the gender their brains are telling them they should be , and the genders of their rest of their bodies . 
  the doctors assigned them based on the latter . 
  they want to be assigned genders based on the former . 
   although the memorandum agreement was not providing any guarantee to the ecb that it will get its money back the memorandum agreement was designed for the purpose of getting greece back on its feet ( so that it could repay its debts ) . 
  no `` guarantee '' of course , but a complete distance from greece explicitly declaring bankruptcy . 
   then when the memorandum agreement was up , and a referendum was proclaimed you find it would have been immoral for the ela ceiling assistance to have increased to guarantee deposits and fend off bank runs if the referendum turned out to be `` no '' , everyone expected we 'd turn to drachma and immediately devaluate it . 
  no matter how much ela increased , it would not have ` fended off a bank run ' , there 's no a single euro that would have remained in the banks by the time of the referendum . 
  so the capital controls were a * inevitability * the moment that tsipras declared the referendum . 
  in 2011 , tsipras himself was saying that a referendum would mean the immediate bankruptcy of greece and the immediate economic devastation of the country before the referendum would have taken place ( http://www.capital.gr/story/3037690 ) now you expect me to believe that tsipras no longer remembered in 2015 his estimation of the catastrophic repercussions of a referendum declaration that he himself had made in 2011 . 
  and yet those repercussions were fulfilled !, 
  it all makes sense of course , if you figure out that tsipras did the referendum at least in part for the express purpose of hurting the greek economy as much as possible , as he himself had predicted in 2011 !, 
   the ecb has been doing this all the time for all european banks when necessary . 
  ela always has a ` ceiling ' . 
  it * lends * money , up to that point , and it expects to have them repaid eventually . 
  the ecb had been increasing the ceiling and helping greek banks maintain liquidity even throughout the first half of 2015 , all the way until the collapse of negotiations , even as all money were fleeing the greek banks in vast amounts the longer syriza was prolonging negotiations . 
   it decided to stop doing it for the greek banks the moment a referendum was announced by the greek government . 
  when the greek government decided to call for a referendum timed to take place after the memorandum date ended , ( and that no 3rd memorandum was ensured ) , if the ecb had increased * further * the ela ceiling , it would mean it would be gifting money to greece that it would never expect to see repaid . 
  the ecb did not even have the * right * to do that . 
  neither the legal right , nor even the moral right . 
   the causal relationship is ecb cut down ela no , the ecb did n't cut down ela , it just did n't increase it further . 
  ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2015/html/pr150628.en.html ) ofcourse , perhaps according to you , ecb should keep lending greek banks money , greece could just perhaps pass a law confiscating those money from the banks , and therefore we can be filthy rich at the expense of the ecb . 
   if you still do not understand the cause & effect statement let 's use another analogy : suppose i am the neighborhood bully and i beat you up every time your friend annoys me . 
  who would you hold responsible for your beatings , me or your friend ? 
  let 's use a different analogy . 
  - your dad ( the greek government ) is alcoholic and unemployed and keeps borrowing money from friends ( the eu ) and not being able to pay them back . 
  from the money he borrows , he gives you ( the greek citizen ) a small allowance . 
  - those friends have nonetheless promised to keep helping your dad ( he can pay them back whenever ) , as long as he attends aa meetings and tried to get off alcohol . 
  - your dad stops attending aa meetings and loudly proclaims that in fact it 's against his dignity to stop drinking alcohol . 
  he also loudly proclaims that he will repay the money he borrowed , because his friends are not friends but rather evil loansharks . 
  - his friends stop lending him money the moment he makes that proclamation , because he fucking said he does n't plan to repay them . 
  - your dad then proceeds to cut your allowance . 
  this is a direct effect of his friends no longer lending him money ( because he did n't plan to repay them and loudly said this ) . 
  who do you hold responsible for cutting your allowance , your dad or his friends ? 
  and yet the side supporting `` no '' , the side that called the referendum , insisted that `` no '' did n't mean a no to the euro , that `` no '' was simply a vote for ` national dignity ' ( whatever the hell that meant . ), 
   so the cause of the banks closing was the decision of ecb not to provide liquidity ... lol , is that in the sense where the only reason people are poor are because some other rich guy does n't want to give them money ? 
  why the fuck should the ecb give greek banks `` liquidity '' by which you mean free money that they could n't trust would ever be repaid back ? 
  the ecb never wronged greece at all . 
  it followed the well-known rules that it had . 
  you can blame the ecb for not providing liquidity , but then again you can feel free to blame any other country or organization for not gifting us with free money . 
  it 's also possible the greek police get informed which ones are the establishment-approved riots and which are n't . 
  i 'm not joking , btw . 
  except that it 's not . 
   look at all this cognitive dissonance , you 're not able to even comprehend that other people say it 's the eu 's fault too . 
  look at you , still not able to mention a single way that the eu wronged greece . 
   but i 'll stop here , because while i pity your self-loathing again you seem to confuse the fact about how i loathe * you * with self-loathing . 
  i do n't self-loathe , i loathe * you * ( plural ) . 
   if the eu was moral , they would have let greece fail in 2009 . 
  so you 're saying that the eu should have refused greece when greece asked to get it debt cut , and the eu should have refused to lend greece money when greece asked to be lent more money . 
  so by the eu wronging greece , you mean eu * helped * greece when greece asked for eu 's help , when the eu should n't have . 
  except that then you 'd have been blaming the heartless eeeevil europeans for letting greece fail , and do n't you dare fucking pretend you would n't . 
   every-fucking-body knew that their `` solution '' would merely contain the problem in greece . 
  their `` solution '' worked for every other country than greece ( e.g. 
  it worked for cyprus , it worked for portugal ) , and it would have worked for greece too , if greece had been willing to implement it , which it did n't . 
  instead greece wanted to raise taxes instead of reform , raise taxes instead of cutting down on the public sector , raise taxes instead of letting private investments happen . 
  most recently ( just a week or two ago ) a 400 million investment in rhodes was banned because of supposed ` archaeological reasons ' that the ministry made up in the last second just in order to pause the investment . 
  to replace the profits greece would have gained that investment , why i bet greece will definitely have to raise some taxes again . 
  but that 's the way the greek establishment wants it , ussr-style . 
   greek language is not a manifestation of greek dna , indeed no , you 're just a greek-language speaker who only ever discusses issues relating to greece , constantly taking the `` official '' greek establishment side on every issue . 
   but do n't forget who pushed you in deeper in the pit so they would n't fall with you . 
  do you think i 'll forget that you 've still not named a single thing that the europeans should have done differently ? 
  because you ca n't . 
  because if anything the europeans offered much more than they * should * have , they should have never agreed to a 3rd plan or even a 2nd , when greece was utterly willing to reform itself . 
  they should have demanded greece to leave euro . 
  tell me a single way that europe has wronged greece . 
  but you ca n't . 
  because it has n't . 
  the only problem is europe treated greece way too gently . 
  so you do n't actually have an actual answer . 
  obviously so , because none exists . 
  because unlike what you and the greek establishment want to pretend , the eu never wronged greece at all , not in the slightest tiny bit . 
   i 'm not a greek . 
  you 've repeated this claim so much that it made me suspicious that the lady doth protest too much , and indeed at https://www.reddit.com/r/greece/comments/3cevfr/\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2_\u03c0\u03b1\u03c0\u03c0\u03ac\u03c2_\u03bf\u03b9_\u03c4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c0\u03b5\u03b6\u03b5\u03c2_\u03b8\u03b1_\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03af\u03be\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd_\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd_\u03b5\u03c0\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b7/csuv7v0 i see you give a greek laughing response to someone doing a greek pun . 
  so you know , odds are extremely in favour you 're indeed greek , not that i actually give a damn either way . 
  whether a greek hater of the eu or a non-greek hater of the eu , you are wrong either way . 
  `` throw us under the bus '' bullshit . 
  the eu gave us the greatest debt-cut in human history . 
  the eu is giving to the most unreliable endebted nation in human history , some of the best terms in human history , what the fuck do you want the eu to have done for you to not consider it `` throwing us under the bus '' ? 
  should it have bankrupted every other nation in the union just to pay greek public servants ? 
  should it throw `` under the bus '' the people of all of eastern europe perhaps ? 
  perhaps the eu should have put them in chains and forced them to work as slaves for the benfit of greece ? 
  fucking explain to me what the eu should have done for you to think that it treated greece fairly . 
  or otherwise shut the fuck up because the idiots who blame non-greeks for greece 's sorry state is the reason that greece is in that sorry state . 
  and i do n't have self-loathing .
