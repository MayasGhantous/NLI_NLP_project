  i have loathing towards the people who brought greece to the state it 's in , and that includes people who think like you . 
   greece was sacrificed to save the eurozone so you could have a better life bullshit . 
  the greek governments have destroyed and keep destroying the greek economy deliberately to promote their own petty agendas ( said agendas ca n't deal with private investments , they instead depend on vast armies of public servants , a soviet-style nomenklatura obedient to the party mechanisms ) greek governments have sabotaged multibillion investments in the mines at skouries , at ellinikon , at asteras , at rhodes ... at dozens of other places . 
  why ? 
  because the greek governments would prefer the greek economy to collapse , than to see private investment that they do n't completely control . 
  i 'm not exaggerating , and i 'm not joking . 
  the current greek government in particular is composed of five parts soviet-union-lovers ( syriza ) , and one-part right-wing-fascists ( anel ) . 
  both parties hate free-market economy and liberalism . 
  ( they incidentally both also fanatically love russia , propagandize russia 's positions constantly , both in regards to ukraine and elsewhere , and hate europe utterly , constantly bashing it ) even socialdemocrats like myself are called `` neoliberals '' by this bunch of left-wing-fascists/right-wing fascists . 
  so , no , greece was n't `` sacrificed '' by any foreigners , greece was deliberately murdered by its own governments , to serve their own agendas . 
   why would this happen because the uk leaves ? 
  because the reason the uk is leaving is because it wants the eu to move in the opposite direction of what other eu members want to move , duh . 
   the uk had to threaten to leave to get any sort of reforms can you people still not get that the word ` reforms ' by itself means nothing , if you do n't specify in what directions the reforms are to go ? 
  it 's clear that the reforms auroricflame wants for the eu are n't the reforms that the uk wanted for the eu . 
  so it 's also clear why he hopes that the uk exit will help push forwards the reforms he wants . 
  what exactly confuses you about this ? 
  it 's pretty clear in the article . 
  and some projections are stupider than others . 
  3d objects always look like half the object , for anyone who looks at them from any position . 
  failure means automatic & complete exit . 
  that 's what the planet looks like from one particular point in space . 
  but from no point in space will it look like the mercator projection . 
  take a look at : https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:global_european_union.svg, 
  mercator projections are stupid . 
  that 's not what my planet looks like . 
  to clarify : '' \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae '' would more normally be used for `` reason '' in the sense of reasoning , but '' \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 '' means indeed `` reason '' in the sense of `` cause '' / `` purpose '', 
  that 's like saying that it makes no sense for hawaii to belong to the united states of america , as it does n't properly belong in the american continent . 
  it 's not the * name * of the union that stands in turkey 's ( or russia 's or canada 's ) way . 
  canada 's reason to not be in the eu is because of geography . 
  turkey 's reason to not be in the eu is because europe does n't trust its government and its people to be properly european in character , whether that 's secularism , democracy , human rights or whatever - the exact same reason we do n't want russia in the eu . 
  there 's probably always something more to add , but each time it becomes harder to fit it in a two-dimensional graph , especially if i maintain the current design choices in regards to e.g. 
  strictly-rectangular shapes . 
  ( the corresponding graph for the americas has 3 groupings that are more complex shapes ) some other possibilities to include , if possible , would be : [ cei ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_european_initiative ) [ seci ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/southeast_european_cooperative_initiative ) [ seecp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south-east_european_cooperation_process ) [ sepa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/single_euro_payments_area ) but i 'm not eager to add anything else in the time being . 
  unless someone else intervenes , the next change will probably when some actual change in something 's membership happens . 
  basically because the graph follows https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_in_europe in regards to which countries to include . 
  switzerland is n't in the eea , i do n't think it can block croatia 's membershp . 
  in regards to croatia , countries just need to ratify the eea agreement for its accession that has already been signed , and which is already being provisionally applied : http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/agreements-conventions/agreement/?aid=2014013, 
  the people who complain about the `` military to russia 's doorstep '' are the vile hitleric scum who want the baltics and the rest of eastern europe to be utterly defenseless when russia decides to invade and recapture them . 
  so keep your fake concern about the victims of bombing , or the victims of actual western imperialism and other crimes , whether current or in generations past -- we * know * that you would cheer a hundred times those deaths as long as they were done by your beloved fuhrer vladimir putin instead . 
  the supporters and enablers of today 's russian imperialism do n't have the slightest moral authority to talk about such . 
  unlike western imperialism , which at least targetted only the regimes of fascist dictators and conquerors ( e.g. 
  gaddaffi or saddam hussein or milosevic ) , russia attacks peaceful countries ( moldova , georgia , ukraine ) that never threatened any of their neighbors and which they could have coexisted peacefully with , if russia had only been willing to do so . 
  and yes , europe is at the forefront of human values -- both socially and politically its people have the highest level of freedoms than anywhere else in the world . 
  no , you 're thinking of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/template:supranational_postsoviet_bodies which includes those ones ( and which is also a diagram i made ) eurasian economic union contains kyrgyzstan , as such it ca n't be included in this diagram . 
  the draft version i had made back in late 2014 , ( https://plus.google.com/115770003376478708929/posts/f4bm4en3tbz ) before kyrgyzstan also joined did include it . 
  cis contains * lots * of completely asian countries , so again it ca n't be included in this diagram . 
  same reason that nato is n't included you know -- not exclusively european . 
  maybe , but is more or less unimportant than cei ? 
  most people have not heard of either , neither of them seems to do anything -- also `` central european initiative '' gives 101,000 hits while `` black sea economic cooperation '' gives 142,000 hits . 
  at first thought , i would in that case make it look like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mluqcol.png ) , extending the common travel area downwards , and making room for uk under the eu customs union . 
  but in 2 years there may well be be more changes than that elsewhere , countries joining or leaving schengen for example . 
  i tried but failed to find an easy way to include the [ central european initiative ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_european_initiative ) which does include slovenia & austria alongside a bunch of other countries . 
  if i had managed to include the cei , germany would * really * look alone at the center of the eu-related projects but not part of any of the other smaller subgroups ... 
  made for usage in wikipedia . 
  clickable version can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/template:supranational_european_bodies older versions of the diagram can be found via the history at https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:supranational_european_bodies-en.svg -- this updated version contains 5 more groupings compared to the previous one : - the eu med - the craiova group - the nordic-baltic 8 - the switzerland-liechtenstein customs & monetary union - the set of microstates that have open borders with the schengen area . 
  hi again . 
  there 's a wikipedia page for [ eu med group ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eu_med_group ) actually , which seems to be the one you had in mind . 
  i 've already designed an update of the diagram which i ca n't link directly right now because it 's in my facebook page ( and links to facebook are disallowed ) . 
  it adds five more groupings , including the `` eu med '' one . 
  i 've also started a discussion in the wikipedia & wikicommons talk pages [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/template_talk:supranational_european_bodies ) and [ here ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file_talk:supranational_european_bodies-en.svg ) about possible objections , in case you want to participate in any ensuing discussion , or if you want to follow the link placed there to check the updated diagram out . 
   i understood you were stating dictators existed who opposed external threats there 's also a significant distinction between `` external threats '' , which are about * actual armies * of a foreign nation invading your country , and `` external threats '' which is about worrying your own citizens will be * convinced * by a foreign-supported ideology to overthrow you and establish a new government friendly to those foreign interests . 
  the latter `` external threat '' , seems more like internal threat that you want to present as external , and it 's the same way that russia talks about western aggression in ukraine , when in reality the actual * military * threat came solely from russia itself . 
  similarly russia talks about a threat from nato , and nato 's supposed aggression because various nations * voluntarily * joined it . 
  this is nonsense . 
  we should never conflate the two types threats . 
  the threat faced by france via russia 's support of lepen , and the threat faced by estonia via the possibility of actual russian tanks invading are two vastly different things , even if both can be considered examples of russian imperialism . 
  bullshit expressions like `` rapidly rising tide of marxism '' does away with the distinction i was making where the horrible oppressors of their own nations nonetheless end up opposing the cross-border aggression of others , even ones nominally on their own ` ideological ' side . 
  pinochet was indeed a horrible oppressor of his own nation , a murderer of thousands and a torturer of dozens of thousands , but right now i do n't remember any case where he opposed * right-wing * imperialism . 
  if we 're to list horrible dictators who opposed ideologically-opposed imperialism , then obviously we 'd also be listing people like fidel castro , saddam hussein , and osama bin laden . 
  there have existed in the past many dictators , who 've resisted against a greater imperialism , even one nominally belonging to the same ideological side . 
  e.g : - in world war ii , the greek fascist dictator metaxas sided with the allies against fascist axis aggression . 
  - during the cold war , the romanian communist dictator ceau\u0219escu opposed the communist soviet invasion of czechoslovakia . 
   it really is an odd song to choose as an anthem , it has nothing to do with the eu the ` unofficial lyrics ' talk about all people becoming brothers , and how joy unites the ones who custom strictly parted . 
  may not fit perfectly but fits well enough for a union of different nations . 
  eu is the most voluntary political union that has ever existed in the history of the planet ( yes , more voluntary than any nation-states themselves ) , that 's why its haters hate it , because they love tyrannies instead and the complete moral superiority of the eu stands in their way . 
  it 's designed for usage in wikipedia via https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/template:supranational_european_bodies which has the image map you want , with hover text ( and links ) for countries & organizations . 
  i 'm the one who made the most recent significant redesign for the diagram of this thread ( see history at https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:supranational_european_bodies-en.svg ) , so if the mediterannean council is a real organisation , i 'll keep this in mind for whenever i next have time to update it ... ... but i do n't see a wikipedia article about it , and i do n't seem to be able to google anything about it either . 
  so , um , is that a real thing or not ? 
   because they have the euro , thus they can not do a damn thing about economic policy right , without the euro , we 'd be more like venezuela . 
  it 's a blessing we ca n't do a damn about * monetary * policy , because then we 'd be definitely doing all the wrong things , same way we 've been doing all the wrong things about those aspects of economic policy that we can do a a damn about . 
   greece ( and europe , for that matter ) needs investment . 
  that 's a clear problem with austerity . 
  the current greek government ( and not just the current one ) is doing its utmost to * stop * investments , * that 's * why greece is in the state it is . 
  we 're talking about political forces that cheer whenever investors flee greece , whenever a factory closes down , whenever a commercial or tourist investment gets cancelled . 
  they treat it as a victory against evil western capitalists . 
  there was an investment due to take place in rhodes . 
  shortly before plans proceeded , the greek government decided to designate a * vast * area in rhodes ( an area bigger than that designated in ancient olympia ) as of being of `` archeological concern '' . 
  this was all clearly just to cancel the investment . 
  in the mines at skouries , every court decision has gone in favour of the mining company , but nonetheless the greek government opposes it , for supposed environmental reasons . 
  in possible investment after possible investment , at elliniko , at asteras , at votaniko , they do the best they can to cancel them , with one excuse or another . 
  so you see , the greek government 's dislike of austerity most definitely does not come from a place of `` we want investments rather than austerity '' . 
  investments is the very last thing they want . 
  greece might become a modern * western * nation , with investments , and why would the fanatical anti-westerners and putin-lovers who are in government want a modern western nation ? 
  georgia tried to recapture the territory that had already been stolen from it by russia and russia 's allies . 
  georgia never attacked russian territory , it was russia which was occupying georgian territory in south ossetia & abkhazia . 
  in abkhazia russia and it allies ethnically cleansed 250,000 georgians to get the `` ethnically pure '' abkhazian state they wanted . 
  russia is already occupying territory of three of its neighbours . 
  `` will go crazy '' ? 
  we 're not talking about it changing its policy by attacking its neighbours , we 're talking about russia * continuing * its policy of attacking and stealing territory from its various neighbours . 
  in the early 1990s it took territory from moldova .
