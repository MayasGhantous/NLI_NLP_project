  basically , whoever came up with the idea of rs knew that there was absolutely no other way to build their ` serb ' republic without ethnic cleansing . 
  even if the bosniaks and croats had said `` sure go ahead , any region that wants to be part of your new country is free go leave bosnia '' , the serbs would * still * need to forcefully evict hundreds of thousands of non-serb before they could get a `` serb '' republic rather than a multi-ethnic one ... 
  the `` bosnian muslims '' who supposedly started the war , the people who wanted an independent bosnia-herzegovina , were n't even all muslims ( let alone islamists ) . 
  one quarter of their army was composed of ethnic serbs and croats . 
  the deputy commander of the bosnian army 's headquarters , was ( ethnic serb ) general jovan divjak . 
  general stjepan \u0160iber , an ethnic croat was the second deputy commander . 
  president izetbegovi\u0107 also appointed colonel bla\u017e kraljevi\u0107 , commander of the croatian defence forces in herzegovina , to be a member of bosnian army 's headquarters , seven days before kraljevi\u0107 's assassination , in order to assemble a multi-ethnic pro-bosnian defense front . 
  in short this is a shameless lie you just said . 
  when it was the serbs that wanted a religiously cleansed state with only orthodox allowed in it , and when it was the `` bosnian muslims '' that were striving for a country where all religions and ethnicities would be respected . 
   if they reject it now it will look like they 're being the emotional and irrational ones and that would n't look good . 
  my personal belief is that syriza is always doing the utmost it can to divide europe , no matter how good or bad this division is for greece . 
  the greek referendum 's main end-result was that the deadline at the end of june expired , and the new agreement will thus have to be ratified by national parliaments . 
  this makes it possible for some parliaments to pass it and others to reject it , causing division and accusation between european nations about who 's to blame for the grexit . 
  you are babbling . 
  the referendum was designed to be as meaningless as possible , so that it would n't constrain the government no matter what happened . 
  a referendum about an invalid proposal . 
  the no side sometimes said it was a referendum about our dignity , sometimes a referendum about this specific proposal , sometimes a referendum that would somehow strengthen greece 's negotiating position , sometimes a referendum against the old political establishment and the media moguls . 
  this ludicrous undemocratic charade with the pretense at democracy as a pr stunt is frankly emblematic of the whole syriza thingy . 
  the one thing the referendum succeeded in doing is cause enough delay to cause the expiration of the 2nd memorandum , thus needing the 3rd one to be approved by the national parliaments of countries we have already angered like germany for calling them nazis or the baltics for supporting putin . 
  at this point i do n't believe syriza wants to keep greece in the euro . 
  it just wants to do everything it can to blame the grexit on the evil europeans , preferably even from the europeans own perspective , so that europe would be divided with accusations regarding who is to blame for the suffering on the greek people that the grexit caused . 
  the prime minister when `` greece was the recklessly spending and lying about its budget '' was [ kostas karamanlis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kostas_karamanlis ) . 
  tsipras chose one of the closest associates of kostas karamanlis in those years ( [ prokopis pavlopoulos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prokopis_pavlopoulos ) ) as president of the greek republic , and it is rumored that he would have picked kostas karamanlis himself except that karamanlis himself refused it . 
  ( tsipras has denied this , but he himself said that he and karamanlis have `` mutual respect '' for each other ) the current `` investigative committee '' examining the conditions of our country 's entry in the memorandum , has considered out of its jurisdiction the entirety of kostas karamanlis ' term in office . 
  to me these are most unexplainable unless you see syriza as just another aspect of the establishment that was in power back then too , doing its utmost to shelter and protect kostas karamanlis and his associates . 
   i would have created separate categories for previous greek governments and current greek government to make the question more accurate . 
  then you 'd also have to add a category for `` both the previous greek governments and the current one '' . 
  because that 's the choice i 'd pick . 
   i still do n't know why politicians who were power back than are n't in jail . 
  they 're part of the same political establishment . 
  to say `` the people running greece now were no where near power '' is a oversimplification . 
  syriza may not have been the governing party before this year , but you can be sure that even when it was in the opposition it helped contribute in the de-industrialization of greece , and that it did n't push ( or it pushed against ) the reforms that needed to be done . 
  the pretense that '' \u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1 '' can be translated to `` fearmongering '' should stop . 
  it 's properly translated to `` terrorism '' . 
  `` fearmongering '' is probably what '' \u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b4\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 '' would be translated as . 
  `` terrorizing '' is what '' \u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 '' would be translated as . 
  `` terrorism '' is the one and only proper translation of '' \u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1 '' . 
  no , he said they are terrorists . 
   anyway what are we talking about you are defending the people that raped greece for 40 years when did i defend anyone like that ? 
  perhaps you should stop trying to be cute , and start trying to communicate . 
   you come and you say this stuff here . 
  shame . 
  russophile communists ... 
  the wall fell , my boy , 25 years ago . 
  yes , the wall fell 25 years ago . 
  so what ? 
  their russophilia is undeniable . 
  their foreign minister has been a pal of alexander dugin . 
  they 've clearly supported all of russia 's actions in ukraine . 
  neither them nor their coalition partners have ever once criticized russia about anything whatsoever . 
  ( seriously i dare you to find a single comment ever by syriza or anel which is even slightly critical of russia or any action russia has ever done ) `` puppets of the kremlin '' is frankly closer to my estimation of them than `` russophiles '' , but i obviously do n't have proof for the former . 
  russophilia is the * polite * interpretation of their actions , far better than `` traitors of their homeland in the kremlin 's pocket '' . 
  as for communism , tsipras belonged to the communist youth of greece . 
   greece could have , and probably should have , left both the eurozone and the eu years ago . 
  but that would 've mainly hurt the eu and done basically no damage to greece . 
  you have it the other way around . 
   russophile communists you are hopefully aware that syriza is practically the definition of `` russophile communists '' ? 
  or at least `` russophile far-radical leftists '' though they do also have explicit communists in their midst . 
  as for russophile , not just the current greek government but previous ones have also been russophile . 
  ( see http://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/a_power_audit_of_eu_russia_relations , a 2007 publication where greece is called russia 's `` trojan horse '' inside the eu , by the ecfr )  if britain said end the privilege of the catholic church to ireland , northern ireland would 've been on fire that evening . 
  if germany said end the privilege of islam in the balkan peninsula to turkey ... i dread to think what would happen . 
  it 's not northern ireland or turkey that has claimed the only way to pay its debts , is if its debts were cut , and that it has no possibly way of fixing its budget deficit without such , when the ultra-wealthy orthodox church is right there getting ludicrous tax breaks and having all its priests paid their salaries by the government . 
  it 's greece that is going to the eu begging for money , while at the same time insulting them . 
  so please shut up . 
  all that verhofstadt said greece needed to do were the things it ought have done by itself , without anyone prompting it . 
   they kept attacking the one guy who was trying to get the economy of greece back on its feet can you explain what makes you think tsipras is trying to get the economy of greece back on its feet ? 
  in fact , if he was trying the exact opposite , if we was trying to finish off all that remained of the greek economy , what more could he have possibly done ? 
  the above is a serious question , please explain what worse he could have done . 
   kick one of your allies when he is down until he is in putin hands . 
  bullshit , in 2007 ecfr had already described greece as being russia 's `` trojan horse '' inside the eu . 
  ( http://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/a_power_audit_of_eu_russia_relations ) greece was already acting as russia 's pawn , using its veto power to further russian goals . 
  in short , greece and the government of kostas karamanlis that 's primarily responsible for greece 's humongous debt expansion was * already * in putin 's hands , before the crisis even . 
  that russia-obedient government was the primary cause of the greek economy crisis . 
  now , the willing lackeys of russia ( like the governing coalition of syriza-anel ) use the big bad europeans to pretend that this is why they 're making sweet eyes towards russia . 
  but of course , they individually had * all * been supporters of russia , long before the crisis occurred too . 
  we can examine their personal history to see if they ever criticized russia about anything , or if they had always been `` russia is awesome , putin is awesome '' instead . 
  ( hint , it 's the latter ) again we have a reversal of cause and effect by syriza . 
  it 's not that they 're going to putin because of the bad europeans are causing the negotiations to fail . 
  rather syriza was already in putin 's hands , and that 's why syriza wants to present the europeans as bad , and wants the negotiations with the europeans to fail ... 
   but syriza presented countless of plans , they are simply being refused by troika , like the one where they found cuts without lowering wages and troika discarded it because they wanted wages to be cut , just like that . 
  `` like the one '' ? 
  i only remember that one . 
  do you have any other ? 
  and yes troika rejected it , because of its extreme and unreliable reliance on gains-via-taxation with no significant reforms or budget cuts . 
  the troika are n't masochists or sadists , they would like greece to get a functioning economy so that greece can eventually repay them . 
  they did n't believe syriza 's ( single ) plan would work . 
  if they believed it would work , they would have accepted it . 
  now where 's all the `` countless '' other plans ? 
   fun fact , the greek economy was growing much faster before we joined the eu . 
  that 's not the difference between a eu and a non-eu country , it 's the difference between a pro-western politician like konstantinos karamanlis ( the 1st ) who got us into the eu , and a pro-soviet politician like andreas papandreou who just grabbed the eu 's money afterwards and installed a soviet-style nomenklatura . 
   nd , former pasok and potami mainly . 
  so the two parties that bled greece to death and one controlled by the biggest media mogul . 
  right . 
  as compared to syriza , anel , and golden dawn , who worship the ground that putin walks on , have all supported his aggression against ukraine , are best pals and penpals with alexander dugin , and all take their orders directly from the russian embassy . 
  oh , and one of them are a bunch of neonazis , while another one is the best friend of all leftist terrorists , and the remaining one is led by an antisemite . 
  see , i can insult the `` no '' parties too . 
   on one hand you blame the no people for the germanotsolias rhetoric , on the other you do the same thing with the `` damn commies '' `` neonazis '' rhetoric . 
  irony much ? 
  i never said `` damn commies '' and are you seriously denying that golden dawn are neonazis ? 
  seriously ?
