  this is the same as the imf `` greece can only pay your money back if and only if the deal on reforms is n't weakened . 
  else it 'll only be able to pay parts of it . '', 
  this is n't actually strengthening greece 's bargaining position . 
  it says to the european if they make a * softer * deal , they wo n't be getting all their money back , and only through a hard deal , they can possibly get all their money back . 
   they announced such a move too often not to . 
  tsipras has n't explicitly announced that he 'll resign in the case of ` yes ' . 
  so you do have the link that indicate a few hundreds of deaths per year ( only some of which can be attributed to the economy ) , and you did nonetheless speak the bullshit of `` 10,000 + people committing suicide per year '' . 
   where is you plan for dealing with a humiliated greece that turns to russia ? 
  tsipras and his party ( and his coalition patners ) already belonged completely to russia . 
  mind you , past prime ministers of greece , like antonis samaras and kostas karamanlis ( the 2nd ) , have also belonged to russia , but their parties were mainly pro-european , so these people had limits on how much they could push a pro-russia strategy . 
  the difference between then and now is that the party of syriza is pro-russian and anti-european from head to toe . 
  saving tsipras `` face '' would n't turn greece away from russia , it would ease greece 's path to it . 
   10,000 + people committing suicide per year where do you get your numbers , dude ? 
  why not say 100,000 , or a million ? 
  who ever gave you those numbers lied to you . 
  http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/09/12/suicide-rate-in-greece-decreases/ `` in the first eight months of 2013 , 229 suicides were recorded in greece ( 193 men and 36 women ) , while in the first eight months of 2014 the suicides decreased to 209 ( 173 men and 36 women ) . '', 
  so in short , someone took a few hundred suicides per year ( only a small portion of which is the economy responsible for ) , and gave you a number of 10,000 + suicides ? 
  now you 'll hopefully begin to understand the sort of lies and demagoguery that the anti-eu side engages in , in greece . 
   everyone know the consequences of the choice no . 
  many of the people say that a ` no ' wo n't result to greece 's exit from the eurozone . 
  many others say that it will . 
  which do you believe ? 
   and syriza has said they will resign if the yes win . 
  they have n't said that explicitly either , though it 's been implied . 
   he is saying to his people : here is this choice that will impact the country for the next 50 years . 
  lol no , that 's what you * wish * he was saying , and that 's what he might be saying if he was honest , but what he 's actually saying is that a ` no ' vote will merely give the greek government a stronger bargaining position with the europeans . 
  the europeans instead say that a ` no ' will pretty much cause a complete end of the negotiations altogether . 
  so again , which is it ? 
  will a `` no '' mean an end to the negotations for a new bailout package , or a stronger position for greece in these negotiations ? 
  no , i have absolutely no reason to believe you trustworthy . 
  do n't believe the lies of the greek government . 
  like all fascists they ca n't acknowledge honest opposition to their opinions . 
  so they must present all such opposition as bribed , coerced or treasonous . 
  i assume you 're not talking about thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura but i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  the greek proposals include gradually scrapping early retirements in a transitory period from 2020-2025 . 
  ( coincidentally starting after the greek government 's current term of office ? 
  :-) the europeans would prefer that this happen sooner , from 2016 or even 2015 . 
   it 's about facts and what lead to this situation . 
  the complete and utter sabotage of greece 's industry and production led to this situation , and in this sabotage the current ruling party is also highly complicit . 
  there are even at this moment frozen investments that could alleviate the suffering of pensioners and low-income individuals immediately with downpayments in the short term and increase in gdp and employment in the long term ( e.g. 
  the ellinikon investment ) , but syriza has completely shut down all of them , some directly , some indirectly by creating an infavourable environment for enterprises , and it had been working to stop them in the same way when it was in the opposition too . 
  i suggest that you do n't take krugman 's words as gospel , because he does n't seem to know anything more than a few numbers about the situation , and he uses those numbers to spew an anti-euro line without being able to explain * anything * about how greece differed from the rest of the eurozone . 
  but it was n't the presence of euro that has delayed the goldmines in skouries from production for more than a decade , it was n't the presence of euro that shut down the coal industry , it was n't the presence of the euro that shut down steel factories , that closed shipping yards or fertilizer companies . 
  the industrial sabotage has been ongoing for 20 years . 
  unless you go and review directly what shut down this and that and the other industry , no , you wo n't bloody explain via generalizing about the euro what caused this mess in greece and greece alone out of all 19 countries in the eurozone . 
  you and krugman would * like * the euro to be to blame , but greece 's problems are n't being faced by the rest of the eurozone countries , and there are reasons for that . 
   besides that , their rethoric really was humiliating for you and your government . 
  what `` humiliates me '' is the unwillingness of other greeks to pay their accumulated debts . 
  what humiliates me even more is the willingness of many greeks to side with fascists and mass-murderers against peaceful countries . 
  what humiliates me is my * own * government and those who support it in its lies and vileness , not europe . 
  i suggest that you stop judging based on your personality about what ` humiliates ' me , because i 'm not you , and the things that shame me are n't the things that shame you . 
  you did n't indicate where he claims they are `` duped '' . 
  and you are the one who should read better : the discussion asks about `` us '' in general , where the `` us '' is left vague in purpose . 
  so my response was about the european nations and leaderships that tsipras is actually talking about , you want to focus on the european peoples that he never really actually mentions ever to the greeks all . 
  because if he ever mentioned them to the greeks after all , some greeks might start wondering `` hold on a sec , we 're effectively asking the taxpayers of other countries to pay for our pensions ? 
  how is that supposedly furthering our national pride ? '', 
   it is obvious he is talking about the imf and others , not the european people . 
  i did n't say he was talking about the european citizens , he does n't refer to them at all one way or another . 
   he claims they are duped also where ? 
  \u039dot in any of the articles i 've read . 
    the rhetoric is constantly about how the europeans wants to subjugate and humiliate us . 
   and ... you are lying . 
  i just watched tsipras and he talked quite differently http://www.eleftheriaonline.gr/ellada-kosmos/item/67029-tsipras-an-theloun-na-tapeinosoun-to-lao-tha-exoun-antitheta-apotelesmata '' \u039f \u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u03bb\u03b1\u03cc\u03c2 \u03b8\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b7\u03bd \u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03cd\u03c8\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03b5 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03c4\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b4\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd . 
  if they are striving to subjugate a nation , they 'll get exactly the opposite results . 
  if they want to humiliate and subjugate a whole people , they 'll have the opposite results . '',

'', 
  that 's his rhetoric and that 's what he 's saying . 
   the greek gov has been trying to convince us that their propositions are for the better of all the eu citizens , they are not trying to make us hate anyone . 
  the rhetoric is constantly about how the europeans wants to subjugate and humiliate us . 
  in the media the germans are being presented as nazis , and all the rest of the europeans are presented as nazi collaborators . 
   solidarity between the europeans is a term that is used on most of their talks . 
  and they never speak about solidarity towards any other nation , only about the obligation that europeans have towards us . 
  when did you last hear about greek government cut its own budget in order to support even poorer nations like e.g. 
  romania or bulgaria ? 
   the current bunch are savvy , have more integrity and care about the people . 
  i think i know more than you about the nature of the current gang of murderer-supporters , arsonist-supporters , and evil-imperialist-dictator-supporters that form our current government . 
  and the very last thing they care about is the greek people . 
   do you seriously believe that the creditors that destroyed your economy care more for the greek people than tsiparas a * rock * cares about the greek people more than tsipras does , as tsipras is deliberately destroying the greek people for his own benefit . 
  as for the ` creditors ' they 're not the ones that destroyed the greek economy . 
  the very idea that you think that 's the case , shows that you 're utterly clueless about the timeline of events . 
   but for fucks sake your country has been humiliated and you are too stupid to notice . 
  fuck you too , you moron . 
  i 'm not interested in ` punishing the current government ' . 
  i 'm interested in responding to their question in the context that they have decided for it , for the purposes that they decided for it . 
  you keep thinking that this is an actual referendum question about a proposal , which the greek government felt ... what ? 
  undecided about ? 
  unauthorized to respond to ? 
  it 's not . 
  it 's a pr ploy , a tool in their negotiations with europe ( in the short term ) and the geopolitical orientation of the nation ( in the long term ) , to turn their vile slander of europe into a ` national position ' . 
  abstention from such a dishonestly held referendum might actually be preferable , but that 's too easily mistaken for indifference . 
   most analysts say the debt is not payable , especially not with austerity . 
  the referendum is n't about whether the debt is payable ( though it is ) . 
  the referendum is n't about whether we want ` austerity ' or not . 
  the referendum is n't even about whether we want the euro or not . 
  the referendum is about whether we 'll submit to the eeeevil europeans who have been eeeeevilly trying to humiliate , subjugate and destroy the greek nation ( in contrast to good and honest allies like russia who are our true friends ) . 
  \u03a4his is effectively the rhetoric which led up to the referendum and by which the referendum is announced , and by which the pm asked us to say `` no '' , and saying `` no '' means that we acknowledge his false version of reality as being correct . 
  when a nation does n't reject and scorn lies , the repercussions are bad . 
  i expect the economical situation of the country to significantly worsen no matter what the result of the referendum . 
  i expect however the long-term political situation to be slightly better if ` yes ' passes ( or atleast gives a very strong showing ) . 
   `` and since you realize this and you want greece to stay in the eurozone and the eu , '' i desire for greece to stay in the eurozone and the eu as true allies .
