  that 's actually a good idea , but what family would want to house a sex offender ? 
  yep , a couple of them attempted to lock themselves onto the anchor 's chain . 
  from what i 've seen ( and maybe i 'm wrong ) it 's not that they feel entitled , rather than they want a chance to raise families , etc , and get an answer on whether they 're going to be deported , moved , or allowed to continue further into europe . 
  at least in leros that seems to be the case ; they mostly want to erase some of the uncertainty rather than get better free stuff . 
  better free stuff wanted the assholes that burned down the refugee center on dortmund because they did n't get enough free food . 
  i quite like the cloister , that 's what i had in mind !, 
  also they made a nice fake [ pediment ] ( http://www.theacropolismuseum.gr/sites/default/files/25.jpg ) on the acropolis museum . 
  it has the shape of the original pediment , the colour approaches the one of the marbles , yet the difference is obvious . 
   you can do something like this the concrete cube does n't blend at all with the remains of the tower ( i 'm not saying , however , that they should 've imitated the old structure , or even used the same materials ) . 
  if they had done a subtler job , i would be in favor of it . 
  but now , i consider the tower destroyed . 
  if you have seen old pottery items restored you get an idea of what i mean . 
  the new parts look similar to the original ones but you can tell them apart . 
  that 's great !, 
  i 'd be interested to see how it will look finished . 
  edit : did n't realize that they would build ** over ** ancient ruins , which sucks . 
  they had also spread misinformation that the balkan route has been opened and that they were welcome . 
  these people are dishonest and dangerous , but it 's all ok in their book because the end ( ideology ) justifies the means . 
  i understand how both parties feel . 
  on one hand we have the refugees that are left there , uncertain for their future , and on the other hand we have the residents of the island who ca n't provide more to the refugees/immigrants ; be it food and water or facilities in general . 
  it is understandable that tension will arise . 
  but , at the same time , i ca n't really find excuses for the refugees/immigrants as the residents could have very well let them drown . 
  i 'm not saying that they should n't be angry , but they should n't make the residents ' life harder as they 're not to blame . 
  edit : spelling, 
  because they 're ideologues and do n't care about the pragmatic effect of their actions . 
  a few months back , in idomeni camp , they assisted refugees in passing the greek-fyrom border illegally . 
  ngos were absolutely aware of what would happen to the refugees if they were captured by fyrom forces , but they went on anyway because they ca n't set their ideology aside and evaluate the situation pragmatically . 
  yes , someone with sense , thank you !, 
  just wait for the internet mob to find it out !, 
  there 's much debate over this . 
  for example , norway has a much more smaller rate of convicts re-committing crimes after their sentence has ended , even though it 's much more lenient towards offenders in contrast to , let 's say , the us . 
  on the other hand , how can two weeks of community service be an appropriate conviction for a sex assault ? 
  unless the integration course is really efficient , this conviction is more of a slap on the wrist . 
  but again , i think it depends on the kind of community service . 
  for example , working/assisting victims of sexual assault ( to the extend that this is deemed safe and/or appropriate ) would be much better than picking litter from the street , as it shows the offender the consequences of his actions . 
  in any case , i 'm very curious to see how the iraqi will turn out after his sentence . 
  : that 's ** social ** science , not actual science . 
  not to devalue social sciences , but they are subjective to a big degree compared to natural sciences . 
  at least make your subs not [ tilt to the side ] ( http://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2012/04/05/greek-shipyard-revolutionizes-labour-rotating-work-once-per-week/ ) !, 
   the `` repaired '' naval submarine `` papanikolis '' appears to have a technical defect and when starting it dangerously begins to tilt to one side .

  ha , we 're on top of europe in a statistic that is not bad !, 
  take that germany ^ ^ ^ ( almost ^ ^ all ^ ^ our ^ ^ military ^ ^ equipment ^ ^ is ^ ^ german ) !, 
  here 's an idea : make all college ~ ~ overgrown children ~ ~ students in the us and the uk spent a semester in poland and see what happens !, 
  do n't really know . 
  i saw the segment on a satire show and they did n't play the whole clip ; just her question and then they started mocking her . 
  yes , he knows how to market himself . 
  [ for your viewing pleasure ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylwmjbx8bwa ) . 
  and bonus meaningless sketch at the beginning . 
  jump to 1:30 if you 're bored . 
  ha , i remember him coming to greece and a tv channel sent its `` tv whore '' to interview him . 
  she asked him if everything on him was big !, 
  so basically , she was a model that used to tell the weather report on her underwear - and other lingerie/costumes you see in porn - and her job was to go from tv show to tv show to bring up ratings . 
  you know , because boobs . 
  the trump jupiter killed me . 
  now someone has to animate it so that it says `` china , china , china . '', 
  interesting , although in greece 's case only the buildings ' skeletons are concrete and the rest were made out of bricks , rather than precast concrete . 
  after the brick structure ( with concrete skeleton ) , buildings are covered with plaster and then painted . 
  you mean during the 90s , after the cold war ended ? 
  you can say so , probably . 
  during the 60s and 70s there were many people who , after the war , became economic refugees ( like my grandparents ) that did manual labor and now were returning to greece , with their small fortunes they had made , in order to star their own families . 
  because this generation was mainly illiterate ( because of the wwii and the civil war ) they wanted their children to be educated and not work the fields or do other blue collar jobs . 
  education was seen as a way out of poverty . 
  that 's why they fled to cities . 
  [ here 's one i took recently . 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/a/xp1s9 ) it 's from the walkway from thisio to monastiraki by the subway tracks . 
  relax , you can criticize all you want if you like !, 
  after all , the biggest critic of athens , and my country in general , is me !, 
  but many cities have managed to secure some green space and had some urban planning in general . 
  in greece we were like : `` if it does n't fit here , then make it fit . 
  sure it 's legal , and if we find difficulties in construction , our civil engineers will find a cheap workaround . 
  what 's that ? 
  you found ancient ruins ? 
  no you did n't ! '', 
  really ? 
  glad you liked it , nonetheless . 
  i do n't like the exarchia area ( at the foot of strefi hill ) even though many people say otherwise . 
  there are a few decent shops to visit , but generally there is nothing interesting there ; it 's dirty , no parks , the square is in a pitiful state , smells of weed everywhere and police troubles are very common . 
  i was talking about the vestas on our parks , actually . 
  are they gon na provide new blades , or will they just fix the tips on the spot ? 
  in these cases i think the most common comment is : `` italy 's coastguard has become free sea taxi . '', 
  edit : spelling, 
  14 people disagreed !, 
  it 's not easy to do any changes in a city of 4.5 million . 
  however , they sold the old airport to a private company which will turn it into a park along with some houses , a mall , and restaurants , which is nice . 
  the thing is , during urbanization in the 60s and 70s these grey , square apartment buildings were the cheapest and most practical housing solution . 
  good job , captain sweden . 
  the surest way to guarantee the rise of the far right . 
  stupid regressive leftists !, 
  this is actually the best view of athens . 
  thurn the camera 180 ^ o and you 'll see a concrete jungle . 
  it 's sad because athens had the potential to become a lovely city . 
  edit : spelling . 
  number 1 reason for this kind of damages is lightning strikes . 
  a lightning stroke on of our turbines completely out of the blue and we had to replace the whole blade . 
  the turbines are almost 16 years old , though . 
  a newer turbine would n't have been damaged so much . 
  edit : spelling, 
  i thing you need to put an '' / s '' in the end of your comment . 
  came back here to say the same thing , sir !,
