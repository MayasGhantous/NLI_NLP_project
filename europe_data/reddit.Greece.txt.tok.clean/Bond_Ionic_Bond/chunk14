  however , i am a fan of the hellenistic period and plato 's / socrate 's period . 
  i wonder if the reason behind this is because the city was separated for so many years . 
  i was going from messe nord to sch\u00f6nefeld during the night . 
  bike was n't a choice !, 
  the first time i had around an hour to spare and just took the s-bahn and went in circles around berlin . 
  it was nice but i 'm not a big fan of berlin 's alternative ( should i say ) culture . 
  munich suites be better . 
  i must make sure i 'll visit berlin properly at least once . 
  first of all , nearly 50 % of brits voted to remain , so you 're just painting them all with the same brush . 
  in addition , many of the leave voters voted to leave because of other reasons besides xenophobia , so calling all the leave voters xenophobes is misrepresenting almost half the electorate . 
  if you want to be fair-ish you could describe a big chunk of the electorate as naive , and the politicians as demagogues . 
  your approach is stupid , and it is an approach common among many populists . 
  labeling all britons xenophobes is just as stupid as calling all greeks lazy , or all austrians far right-wingers , or all muslims radical orks . 
  how can we achieve separation of church and state if we keep funding religion ? 
  i see your point , but the best solution is to crack down on illicit funding . 
  granted , i speak from an ideological stand , not a pragmatic one , but i would n't like , as a tax payer , to see my money go to muslim groups just to stop them from seeking illegal funding . 
  imagine if someone told you that we have a bunch of immature moderates that we have to fund in order not to get funded by our enemies ( i know that saudi arabia is really an ally , but they 're no less fanatics that isis ) . 
  no , the just solution is to monitor the money that go in and out of those groups . 
  i 'm not , however , one of those teabaggers that are allergic to the word `` taxes . '', 
  i actually support high taxes provided that they are spent on infrastructure and services that serve society ( even if i do n't use them ) , but religion is n't any of these . 
  by funding muslim groups you may be able to protect them from middle eastern lunatic imams , but you 'll only make the anti-islamic sentiment in europe greater . 
  ** greece : ** people are posting a text on facebook declaring that they 're not ok with zuckerberg stealing their public data . 
  ( someone started a prank/rumor that facebook will steal and use their photos etc and people fucking baited ) . 
  even more people are ridiculing/complaining about people posting this text . 
  some future tellers were caught scamming their clients ( big surprise , i know ) some of which were very popular public figures . 
  they managed to take 52,000 euros from one of them . 
  other than that , an old lady opposite my house things it 's a good idea to go outside at 6 am , hail all the neighborhood 's stray cats and kick out the ones she does n't like . 
  pff amateurs . 
  my car 's thermometer shows 30 ^ o c at 7 am . 
  temperature reaches the 40s aroung 3-4 pm . 
  these big boxes on four wheels that are not pulled by horses . 
  or , alternatively : vroom vroom , beep beep . 
  i upvoted you but i do n't like your `` monitor the internet '' part . 
  sure , close down radical profiles , but nsa-ing peoples online activity will get us to shady places . 
  i 'm also dead against the government providing funds for religious activities . 
  if a religious group wants money they should get it from religious people , not our taxes . 
  nice to see that the turkish government respects global heritage monuments . 
  ^ ^ ^ / s i 'm neither a christian nor a fan of the byzantine empire , so there are no personal feelings involved , but this grinds my gears because it was a step backwards for turkey instead of forward . 
  i 'm not very surprised really . 
  older greek migrants abroad are behaving shitty to newer greek migrants . 
  this does n't make any sense !, 
  i passed through berlin last november . 
  did n't see the city , so i ca n't tell , but the s-bahn was awful - especially during the night . 
  and when everyone turned their heads he said `` nein , ich bin so lustig ! '', 
  fun times !, 
  you mean it actually tastes good ? 
  wow . 
  and people call me crazy for enjoying watermelons with feta !, 
  only during the summer though . 
  hey , that 's our job !, 
  it 's laughing at all these from goldfisch himmel . 
  a friend of mine from the us once told me that he had deep fried oreos . 
  i ca n't even imagine that .

  r/news ? 
  they will make a pc police , but they wo n't arrest any attacker whose skin colour is darker than white , or transgender , or a muslim , or a member of a minority in general . 
  to be fair to him though , the previous two governments ( that shared the `` wheel '' of the country since 1974 ) were the yes men of the eu . 
  samaras ( pm before tsipras ) would only go to eurogroups to get the list of the necessary austerity measures and negotiate a few details ( like increased vat instead of fighting tax evasion ) . 
  tsipras was the alternative to all these technocrat , puppet governments . 
  i think everyone would agree that the eu has problems , but tsipras and farage instead of wanting to improve the eu they chose to say a big * fuck you * to it . 
  i can draw a lot of parallels between these two referendums . 
  the `` leave '' and `` no '' voters were middle and mostly working class , communists , fascists , nationalists , eurosceptics , and people who just wanted to protest with their vote . 
  the `` stay '' and `` yes '' voters were upper class , business men , economists , people whose interest was to stay in the eu . 
  both tsipras and farage put forth the ( false ? ), 
  dichotomy that we 're either going to go our way , build a strong nation , be the bosses of our selves , yada yada yada ( actually tsipras did n't say exactly that - he said that we would be respected more within the eu - our minister of defense said it ) , ** or ** we would be under the control of bureaucrats and technocrats in brussels . 
  even i was deeply perplexed and ended up voting a not valid vote , because on the one hand i did n't want a `` yes sir '' government but on the other hand i did n't want us to leave eu , not only because it was in my interest to stay , but because we kinda need it ; you wont believe how many infrastructures are co-funded by the eu , or in how many respects greece has been improved because we had to comply by it 's standards , not to mention the opportunities the youth and especially the students have within the eu . 
  the eu , ecb and imf put forth an austerity program on 25.6.2015 and on that tsipras said that he 'll do a referendum so we could decide if we wanted it ( the program ) or not . 
  the referendum took place in the 28th of june , but the aforementioned institutions withdrew this specific program before that date . 
  given that sch\u00e4uble had said that a * `` no '' * vote would mean a grexit , people interpreted the choice as a yes or no to the eu , but syriza kept saying that it was n't a yes or no to the eu because there was no possibility of greece leaving the eu . 
  it was vague af . 
  after the referendum when a grexit was looming ( capital controls , bank holidays ) tsipras backed up and decided to go forth with a new austerity program , different from the one we supposedly voted on , and put the country on elections again where he got re-elected - mainly because of lack of any other alternative . 
  edit : some spelling . 
  to be fair , tsipras is , or rather used to be , an ideologue . 
  generally , syriza has a lot of them , some left when the party split after the referendum and some remain to this day . 
  actually , we voted * no * to specific austerity measures which were withdrawn even before the referendum took place . 
  tsipras only wanted something to negotiate in the game of chicken he was playing with the eu , and he got it - a 60 % majority . 
  he basically told sch\u00e4uble `` look , the majority of greeks do n't want more austerity , you ca n't ignore their democratic choice . '', 
  to which sch\u00e4uble responded `` sehr gut . 
  then you leave the eu . '', 
  and tsipras chickened out . 
  his flip was even faster than tsipras ' after our referendum !, 
  now that i re-read it under the influence of caffeine , you probably expressed yourself clearly . 
  i think he chose a cinema because there are a lot of people concentrated in a dark room with no immediate access to exits . 
  imagine sitting in the middle of the row and hear gun shots , how easy you think it 'll be to run to the nearest exit fast ? 
  on the contrary , if the same happens on a park , you can run to a random direction , relatively free of obstacles and you can see where you 're going . 
  territorial waters end , as defined by the 1982 united nations convention on the law of the sea , at 12 nautical miles or less off the coast, 
  they pick them up from international waters , not libyan or tunisian . 
  the worst we could do is ship them back home , not let them drown . 
  yes , they said `` let 's get drowned between greece and turkey in order to escape isis . '', 
  an it 's not that everything is vanilla in africa too . 
  greeks want to leave greece because it 's a corrupt and bankrupt country , would n't african 's want to leave their ? 
  the problem is n't that we do n't let them drown . 
  the problem is that we 're not checking them to see which are legit refugees and can contribute positively to society and which are criminals that want to bring sharia or whatever . 
  i 'm all for imprisoning and deporting the rapists/terrorists/thieves among them , but letting them drown is immoral . 
  letting them drown is what horseshit countries like the emirates would do , not european ones . 
  in the refugee camp in piraeus afghanis attacked syrians and in idomeni pakistanis attempted to rape some refugee children . 
  deport those fuckers , i do n't care , or let them rot in prison beside the assholes that burnt down the refugee center in dortmund because they did n't get enough free food , but i would n't let them drown in the mediterranean along with people that actually need help . 
  pretty shitty thing to do imo . 
  quotation marks are unnecessary . 
  when you live in lesbos and you see a boat that normally sits 12 but there are 40 people on it , capsizing what do you do ?
