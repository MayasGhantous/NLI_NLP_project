  stand and watch ? 
  you choose sunny days to lock yourselves inside a dark room and watch a movie ? 
  i thought sunny days are for lying on the grass , some of you even naked . 
  the cinema is the preferred activity when the weather is shitty and you ca n't sit outside . 
  to your defense i always saw greek as much harder to learn than some european languages - including german and , obviously , english . 
  now it seems pretty obvious , but obviously i was n't thinking when i wrote it !, 
  screaming : ** `` aus dem weg !, 
  '' ** edit : spelling . 
  will they remove mini-britain from mini-europe ? 
  ca n't stand the wait , the suspense kills me !, 
  it 's nice to see that the press is so unbiased and professional . 
  we just found brexit 's new slogan : * eu , it seems redundant . 
  * ^ ^ tm they have a day to use it . 
  council of the european union ** and ** european council . 
  why have two institutions with the same name doing different things ? 
  it seems redundant and they even have the same symbol . 
  misleading title so you comment is off here , but other than that well said !, 
  maybe they have a * secret * secret police and no ones knows about it . 
  i 'm actually an introvert too , but i 'm thinking : what 's the worst that 's going to happen ? 
  worst case scenario , i spent a couple of hours with someone i do n't like , but i get to see the city from a local 's perspective . 
  carl sagan was the only guy on earth who could say `` yeah , i drive a pacer , but i steered the voyager 1 space prob when it left the solar system to take a picture of planet earth . '', 
  tifu by reading * planetarium * instead of * parlamentarium *, 
  they found us . 
  run !, 
  ~ ~ planetariums usually are interesting - when they do n't show these annoying children shows . 
  just imagine watching * cosmos * there . 
  mind = blown . ~ ~ edit : i 'm blind . 
  still not as bad as the [ american pacers ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/amc_pacer_1975-1978.jpg ) !, 
   frankly , i think decisions like this should not be decided by people who have no degree in economics . 
  interestingly enough , plato hold the same view on democracy . 
  he thought people , and especially kings , should be philosophers , and not the average peasant . 
  these secret cia prisons are n't so secret now , eh ? 
  i go sightseeing too , but i 'd rather have stories from locals to tell , than a report of the places i visited . 
  these americans were indeed really extroverted . 
  personally i prefer couchsurfing in order to meet people when i 'm abroad . 
  i hear that brussels does n't have tourist attractions , like paris , athens or rome , but it has a nice lifestyle and easygoing people . 
  which is preferable imo . 
  i 'd rather be going from cafeterias to pubs and meet interesting people , than going from museum to museum with all the cringy stereotypical tourists that try to take stupid selfies . 
  i even know a group of americans that come to athens every year who say that sightseeing is fun , but drinking ouzo with locals is better . 
  edit : clarification, 
  already two firefighters have died in cyprus . 
  greece has sent two cl-415 canadairs and 2 super pumas . 
   brexit might cost the uk its place in mini-europe , a brussels theme park , where european landmarks , including the eiffel tower , the acropolis and mount vesuvius , are recreated in painstaking miniatures ok , that 's the best argument against leaving so far !, 
  and ugly too . 
  if you remove all the ancient monuments and the nice part of the center you are left with millions of big , square , concrete apartment buildings , heavy traffic , pollution and barely any parks . 
  salamis is an island right next to the town in which i live . 
  it is connected to the mainland via a ferry line and they have been `` planning '' for years to build a bridge instead . 
  from what i know the cost-benefit ration is pretty big . 
  that 's why it is n't done yet , this and the fact that you have to go through a hell of bureaucracy and corruption to get a project like that started . 
  edit : last time i checked , they did n't even want to build a bridge , but an underwater tunnel instead . 
  because , you know , normal bridges are too cheap for us !, 
  german shovels will write `` siemens '' on them . 
  irish fans soften sch\u00e4uble 's heart . 
  man , i want these irish fans to take a trip to athens and grab a pint with them . 
  do you take dogecoins ? 
  that 's it , i 'm going on my safe space to put aloe vera and look at some old drachmas . 
  they say they 're anti-patriarchy . 
  is there serious gender equality problems in italy ? 
  i hope they 're legit and not start saying that everything is sexist , racist , etc. 
  also , collective intelligence ? 
  what does that mean ? 
  people are individuals not a collective . 
  there 's a difference between popular opinion and majority choice , and the hive mind . 
  have n't you heard ? 
  u/executivemonkey is the official r/europe troll . 
  as an amateur wanna-be astronomer , this is painfully true ... you have to drive for km and km and be lucky enough to have a clear atmosphere in order to get a decent view of a starry night . 
  never heard of it actually . 
  yes , but they take space from syria and they do n't want to leave us alone . 
  more like 1.60934 thank you 's !, 
  football idiots do what football idiots do ... 
  i went to the beautiful m\u00fcnchen in november to watch bayern - olympiacos for the champions league , and a bunch of idiot olympiakos fans climbed on the second floor of a 2-stories wooden shop building in karlsplatz to hang an ultras banner . 
  i was nearby enjoying a cup of gl\u00fchwein and felt really embarrassed . 
  although i see your point , what u/robiepax said is n't just a gut feeling . 
  it 's more like an empirical observation . 
  it can still be highly subjective and thus wrong , but it does n't come as a surprise ** to you ** when data confirm your subjective experience . 
  politicians is n't exactly the same as the law . 
  when you abide by the law , you do n't do what politicians tell you , you do what the law tells you . 
  the law is an independent entity , so to speak . 
  yep , exactly right . 
  do n't know why you got downvoted tho ' . 
  crash course is a very nice channel . 
  totally recommended !, 
  i propose all the muslims that put islam over the law should go in the middle of nowhere ( antarctica preferably ) and found islamistan , and leave sane muslims with us in the civilized world . 
  * thank you ? 
  * do you speak metric ? 
  6-7 thousand to cover my study costs . 
  `` democracy works , look at greece ! '', 
  -500 bc `` democracy does n't work , look at greece ! '', 
  - today, 
  hear hear , this man talks sense !, 
  well , he at least is n't corrupt to the bone and politically correct . 
  i opt for a trump presidency , not because he 's remotely capable of being one , but we 'll have a lot of triggerings and many things to laugh about . 
  i do n't think there will be any serious drawbacks , that 's media fear mongering . 
  i mean us has already been through bush jr. administration , twice !, 
  he 's too busy checking if he has small hands . 
  pretty much . 
  on the islands i usually see a german couple with 2 empty beer bottles ( often mythos , because the other greek beers are piss ) , 2 that have just been opened and a salad . 
  i have actually started doing this myself . 
  ca n't say you 're wrong , since we were voting the same 2 parties the last 40 years , and the first time we voted a 3rd party it did they same things as the other two . 
  and in terms of moderation ?
