  i saw someone saying he was banned from r/unitedkingdom for linking an r/unitedkingdom 's post on r/ukpolitics . 
  do n't forget to buy ** one ** greek salad and eat five people from it !, 
  r/ukpolitics is the sane subreddit and r/unitedkingdom is the echo chamber , liberal safe space , right ? 
  to be fair , right-winger in greece comes together with being a nationalist conservative . 
  our leftist trolls use the word * neoliberal * as a curse to describe people who are pro free speech , direct democracy and the free market . 
  you can take our money , but you will never take our ouzo !, 
  rough !, 
  i did n't google it , special snowflake , i remember it from an interview i watched . 
  sam harris, 
  ima pole in the middle of a bicycle lane in turkey . 
  ama, 
   an universities teach something else which you ** personally ** decided is `` regressive leftism '' fyi , i did n't came up with that term . 
  it 's a colloquial term used to describe people with this exact mentality/ideology . 
  yes , continue to say there is no evidence for anything and turn a blind eye . 
  you figured out you were wrong from the beginning and you just decided to make a fuzz over semantics `` not all idiots are regressive '' and nag `` this is n't evidence , that is n't evidence . '', 
  syriza 's gender equality council does the same things as sadiq khan , and [ she ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.gr/katerina-chamaleli/-_5404_b_9857974.html ) expresses the same opinions that are taught in gender classes in us universities , but noooo , no evidence for this nefarious group . 
  no relation there , whatsoever . 
  if , in order to be convinced , you 're expecting people to write a golden letter in which they claim to be `` regressive leftists '' and express their solidarity and agreement with every idiot in the world , you 're deeply benighted . 
  but then again , ignorance is bliss . 
  you did n't correct me , regressive leftists exist , you just do n't like any definition . 
   nobody in syriza was offended at the halloween shit in missouri [ insert `` the point '' - `` you '' meme ] we should have a bot for that the people who are offended by the halloween costumes , have the same ideology with the people in syriza 's council of gender equality who were offended by the phrase `` hit like a man '' and the butthurt , blue-haired , sensitive snowflakes from london that they have inferiority complex and made their mayor censor ads that they do n't like . 
  get it ? 
  do you really not understand , or are you doing this on purpose ? 
  and universities do n't teach `` regressive leftism '' they teach `` gender studies '' and other shit like that , whose curriculum is exactly the horseshit regressive leftists preach . 
  yeah agreed , but if , and i say * if * because i 'm not sure , you make little kids take a choice ( even if it 's not a mandatory one , kids will perceive it as an important choice to make ) you 'll confuse more kids than you 'll help . 
  i 'm just skeptical at this point and i only make assumptions , i need more evidence in order to shape an opinion . 
  if they teach kids tolerance , they i 'm totally for that . 
  i say these things because i have seen parents that try too hard to be progressive and ask their kids things like `` do you want to play with boy toys , or girl toys ? '', 
  it 's a little kid , let it decide without putting forth dilemmas . 
  so , according to you there are idiot leftists , but not regressives . 
  you do n't like the word regressive and * idiots * it 's just to broad and none specific . 
  tell me which characterization is right for you , supreme leader ? 
  i 'm almost convinced that you 're willingly blind on the issue . 
  there are no regressives , you say , cause there is no proof , even though there are complete university classes that teach these bullshit . 
  and to answer your question : yes , the people inside syriza 's council of gender equality have the same views with butthurt feminists from missouri , greek feminist groups ( \u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ad\u03bd ) and the mayor of london . 
  that 's why they demand ads to be censored ( jumbo , \u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4 \u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 ) . 
  well , i still stand behind that censorship is a fascist tactic , but i 'll admit `` authoritarian '' is the right word . 
  that said , i wanted to say that in a hypothetical dystopian future , a fascist government that came out of the left , is much more likely than one that came out of the right , but it all backfired on me . 
  i would be wrong if it was the case that not all regressives are idiots . 
  but now , since that 's not the case , i 'm correct . 
  again , they may not have official representatives in the parliament or something , but they are a group , they share an ideology and they push an agenta . 
  they have formed organizations and they 're lobbying . 
  they do n't politicize through political parties , but they do it through pressuring political leaders . 
  what you 're saying is the equivalent of saying `` hippies do n't exist , they do n't have a leader and representative in the congress . '', 
  also , i send you 5 examples and you chose to concentrate on one . 
   censorship long predates fascism i can agree to that . 
  the mayor of london wo n't become hitler or mussolini because he censored some ads , but censorship is a fascist tactic nonetheless . 
  the army is not a fascist exclusive thing , it 's like saying `` hitler was a vegetarian , is every vegetarian hitler ? '', 
  i mean to say , that you can expect a government that censors to become a fascist government much more likely than you 'd expect a government that has an army to become a fascist one . 
  but all regressives are idiots . 
  venn diagram , dude . 
  the regressive circle is completely inside the idiot circle . 
  nefarious ? 
  only if you 're blind on purpose . 
  they do n't have a banner that writes `` regressive left '' and they do n't have appointed leaders , but they are a group of people that share the same ideology and have intellectual leaders . 
  but , i guess when everything fails just say that the other person 's sources do n't have merit / are biased , or whatever . 
  regressives are idiots . 
  but , whatever you say dude , [ there ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qqgncktbsa ) [ is ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vln9d81eo60 ) [ no ] ( http://tvxs.gr/news/ellada/elliniko-seksistiko-dimosio-kai-pos-tha-allaksei-pinakes ) [ regressive ] ( http://dailycaller.com/2016/06/13/homeland-security-instructed-to-combat-violent-extremism-with-political-correctness/ ) [ left ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/13/lse-study-gender-quotas-positions-power-women ) . 
  they crap on the board and march on it triumphantly ? 
  yes , there are no idiot leftists in the uk and the us , riiiight . 
   the regressives do n't exist of course they do . 
   and on the other side of the atlantic , you have no clue what is going on enlighten me then . 
   because they simply disagree with something , while they also provide their reasons why there , ftfy . 
   of course . 
  the regressive left is a threat only in the minds of retards . 
  bnp and edl have almost ** zero ** influence , anywhere . 
  the regressives have a mayor . 
  and if we go to the other side of the atlantic they have filled all the universities . 
  edit : do you remember ellen pao ? 
  do you think people called her pao zedong for now reason ? 
  you also karma-shaming me , because you have more karma . 
  #racist ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  it 's not that they do n't let you see hot chicks or something . 
  it 's that he 's pushing an ideology by using his authority as a means to achieve that . 
  a government can censor false advertising , that 's not the same thing as censoring an ad in order to appease a certain group of people and put forward their ideology . 
  also , let me clarify something . 
  first of all i said ** if ** england were to become a dystopia , the left would have employed fascist tactics to get them there , and not the right , making it in essence a fascist left . 
  do you think that the bnp or the edl are a more real threat than the regressive left ? 
  secondly , i said :  censorship , at least in this case , is a fascist tactic and it is , for reasons i explained . 
  i did n't say that the mayor of london is fascist , let alone `` literally hitler '' ( which you pulled out of your head ) . 
  you just got triggered or something and jumped all over me . 
  when someone is a fascist , he 's not literally hitler . 
  that 's your inspiration , or should i say assumption . 
  censorship , at least in this case , is a fascist tactic , especially if it 's done formally by a member of a governmental body . 
  how would you describe someone on a powerful position who decided to censor something because he disagrees with it ? 
  he may be hiding behind good intention but this is irrelevant . 
  censorship ** is ** fascism . 
  even if you dress it up with harmless-looking phrases like `` body shaming '' and it 's done in the name of `` not hurting someone 's feelings . '', 
  also , which part of * if * do n't you understand ? 
  dude , let me ~ ~ explain ~ ~ mansplain my self further . 
  if england turns into v for vendetta 's dystopia , the fascist government will be a left government , by the looks of it . 
  also , `` body shaming . '', 
  yeah , right . 
  because if you 're fat and you see a thin model on an ad , it was definitely done on purpose in order to shame you . 
  the previous minister of education , aristides mpaltas , wanted to remove student awards because  excellence is stigma , a distorted ambition . 
  he also wanted to discontinue prototype and experimental schools . 
  of course he was ridiculed and scrutinized . 
  he tried to explain himself by saying that when a student is good and you reward him , then you put high expectations on him and he ca n't cop with . 
  fortunately he was made to resign . 
  thirding this ( that 's not even a word ) .
