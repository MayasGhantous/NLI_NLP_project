  i 'm center leaning towards left and i find myself relating more into the conservative/right parties than left ones . 
  the left is completely fucked up , especially in greece where the `` left '' leading party is completely thatcher-like when it comes to economy and ( almost ) completely regressive left when it comes to society . 
  we even have a gender equality council that is a feminist hive that demands `` sexist '' ads to be censored . 
  but the fascists are the left this time . 
  big news !, 
  the regressive mayor of london did something regressive . 
   `` religion and education do not belong together '' . 
  damn right !, 
  that 's one case . 
  most five year olds do n't have a clue about sex , gender , sexual orientation , etc. 
  at lest that 's what i know from five year old kids in my family . 
  yes , i 'm aware of that . 
  but what do five year olds ** know ** about gender . 
  it 's equally as stupid if you asked them to chose political affiliations at the age of five . 
  let 's assume that a five year old chooses to wear a skirt , this does n't mean that he 's gay or a crosdresser or anything , it means that , for some reason , he found the skirt cooler than the trousers . 
   pupils as young as five can dress in the uniform in which they feel most comfortable . 
  five ? 
  what do five year olds even know about gender ? 
  flair checks out ... 
  i think . 
  well , have an upvote then !, 
  kinda makes sense , does n't it ? 
  when you have members of x , y and z populations committing the majority of crimes , then you should have a more cautious attitude towards said members . 
  who 's more likely to carry a bomb , an old , british lady or a brown skinned , 30something man from pakistan ? 
  if a lot of old , british ladies carried out bombings then we should be more cautious towards old , british ladies , but that 's not the case . 
  i imagine that sucks for the members of x , y and z that have their hands clean , but i do n't know of any better alternative . 
  of course we should force them to . 
  but forced labor is n't really popular , especially in germany . 
  regardless of that , maybe a huge part , or maybe even the majority , are a bunch of ungrateful cunts that want to enjoy benefits , but since i 've witnessed the refugee crisis first hand in athens i have to say that - even if it sounds cliche by now - not all refugees are ungrateful cunts . 
  i met a few syrians who legitimately wanted to contribute to the society . 
  one of them already does . 
  auto correct strikes again !, 
  kinda agree actually , but my opinion is n't set yet . 
  it reminds me of the dilemma : should we create more jobs , or give aid to the unemployed and homeless ? 
  you ~ ~ brake ~ ~ break it , you fix it . 
  edit : typo . 
  well it is important , otherwise you vote a party which positions and program you do n't know . 
  something almost everyone does . 
   for ordinary people low wages , high taxes , and rampant corruption have become an obstacle to a decent life , and many of my friends and colleagues have chosen to emigrate . 
  so hungary is becoming greece . 
  we have the rotten infrastructures too . 
  the only difference is that tsipras is n't building anything for himself , or in general . 
  i can relate to the author almost 100 % . 
  that 's sadly true . 
  i remember a comic strip where a science lab caught on fire and the scientist mentioned to the press that the fire destroyed all the colonies with the cancer cells . 
  the next day 's headline wrote ** `` fire cures cancer !, 
  '' ** edit : word, 
  yes , i know . 
  i mentioned him because he 's the only far-right that committed mas murder for ideological reasons , at least that i know of . 
  i know that , at least in greece , people do n't even bother . 
  ah , typical english football fans . 
   police said one of the fans was arrested for assaulting a barman why would you attack your best friend ? 
  probably the author of the article knows shit about what he 's writing about . 
  reminds me of the show john oliver made about scientific studies , or rather how the media present them . 
  this is r/nottheonion material . 
  the arsoners should be forced to rebuild the shelter and then get deported . 
  harsh ? 
  maybe , but it 's well deserved . 
  do we really want people that complain about ** free food ** and start fires about it resulting to millions of damages ? 
  i 'm pro helping people in need , especially if they 're fleeing war and persecution , but not if they 're entitled , disrespectful assholes . 
  hear , hear !, 
  i may be the only greek that relates to these . 
  once a stranger on a bus stop started telling me about his dogs . 
  i mean , dude , what 's next ? 
  you 'll tell me about your sex life , too ? 
  now you put u/therealdarious in an awkward situation . 
  we hail bushes and taxis by raising our hands in greece . 
  i saw one little girl one time that she obviously wanted to copy her mother and hail the bus , but she did a nazi salute instead . 
  i experience these situations every-single-day . 
  i especially hate it when taxi drivers ( worst people ever ) drive on the right lane and jump in front of all the traffic at the last moment to make a left turn , because , you know , the other drivers that stay in the left lane and wait for their turn to make a left turn are clearly idiots . 
  edit : word, 
  i only had to assemble a furniture once . 
  it was pretty obvious ( it was a pc desk ) , but i only skimmed through the instructions only to make sure i would n't fuck up . 
  my father on the other had , it 's 100 % certain that he 'll fuck up , so he follows the instructions by letter . 
  that 's actually pretty smart . 
  and pretty depressing too , that you have to print your program as a product catalog because people are too lazy to read rather important documents . 
  not just dictators . 
  you can be prosecuted if you insult obama , but i do n't think obama would be such a narcissist so that will want to press charges against someone who insulted him . 
  i 'm guessing this law 's purpose is to prevent diplomatic disasters . 
  it 's not hard to imagine that when this law was first implemented , a leader such as erdogan could easily cease all diplomatic relations with germany , with all the consequences that it entails . 
  i also think that they want to abolish this law . 
  i 'm not an expert on german law , i 'm only stating what i 've been told !, 
  actually there is an outdated german law that states that if a german insults the leader of a foreign sovereign nation , that leader has the right to press charges against him , but the german government must give the green light first . 
  merkel , in essence , said to both b\u00f6hmermann and erdogan to go short it out like adults . 
  b\u00f6hmermann also said at the beginning of his poem that it 's just a provocative piece and wants to see how far he can push erdogan ( i 'm paraphrasing ) . 
  i 'm gon na start calling you sanemark from now on !, 
  meanwhile in greece , not only we have blasphemy laws , but we enforce them too . 
  a guy was sentenced to serve 10 months in prison because he operated a facebook page where he made fun of a monk who supposedly cured cancer ( but died from it ) and was recently sanctified . 
  he even made up a fake miracle story and everybody bought it !, 
  i think that happened everywhere in europe . 
  would you execute stormfronters too ? 
  garden boys is surely a euphemism , right ? 
  right ? 
  so , in these kind of occasions i like to use the nazi analogy . 
  certainly you would n't revoke the citizenships of every stormfront member , after all they did n't commit any mass shootings like breivik did , whom you could certainly revoke citizenship from . 
  did the person on the article assist any terrorist , or did his contribution ended with facebook posts ? 
  i do think however , that terrorism advocates should be put under surveillance , but who knows in which kind of encroachments of rights will this result to in any case , kudos to denmark for not remaining blind on the issue . 
  i hope i 'll be accepted to study there . 
  i love this coffee . 
  does n't compare to that brown water they call filter coffee ( or simply coffee in the us ) .
