  i drink it rarely though , because i do n't want to spoil it for me . 
  i just reacted to your comment . 
  should i expect to be sued by the fine brothers ? 
  i think it 's because we both dislike turks ( and arabs ) . 
  like it would make sense if the irish really liked the french because they both dislike the english . 
  some colleagues actually came back from iran and said that iranians are very hospitable too . 
  well , wait until all the mercedes in turkey overheat due to the black covers and you 'll have to buy spare parts from germany . 
  do i smell a conspiracy here ? 
  hmmmm ... 
  we started calling armenian genocide coffee , greek coffee back in the 60s . 
  that will actually piss turks off . 
  trust me , i have witnessed a lot of internet fights like that : - it 's not kebab , it 's gyros and it 's greek . 
  - no it 's kebab you stupid gay-reek, 
   he ** bought ** all the cocacola and fanta not a very bright man i 'd say . 
  reminds me of the time some golden dawn members wore t-shirts that wrote `` unemployed greek '' and went from traffic light to traffic light washing cars ' windshields . 
  they wanted to show how much money pakistanis and gypsies `` steel '' from greeks by doing these kind of jobs . 
  i 'm sure that drivers feel the same empathy towards `` unemployed greeks '' and pakistanis . 
  fuck those italian fridges , man . 
  they look good but their electronics suck . 
  that 's a lot of freedom . 
  ftfy, 
  this should be in r/nottheonion, 
  oh * the guardian * , of course !, 
  literally greece . 
   eighteen women have said they were sexual assaulted at a music festival in germany . 
  well , let 's not jump to concl ...  the three men who have been arrested are asylum seekers from pakistan . 
  all have been charged with sexual assault charges . 
  i 'm sorry mate . 
  i thought by this time everyone would have seen it . 
  but it 's a very mild spoiler , it wo n't destroy the episode for you . 
  shit , in wien too ? 
  i get luton , or manchester , or even g\u00f6thenburg , but wien ? 
  we have around one million muslims in athens alone and there are no sharia patrols , as fas as i know . 
  they can actually both be the shortest route . 
  imagine an ellipse , long axis being the y axis , with two points , a and b , on either end . 
  the bottom and upper halfs are the same length . 
  so i ca n't say for sure , but these two routes can be the same length . 
  as to why they take two different routes , i suppose it 's because of traffic . 
  my flight from madrid to athens took me 2 hours 45 mins , so yeah , i 'd imagine it 's about 2 hours from milan to madrid . 
  also , flight radar now allows you to view the plane 3d in real time . 
  it 's like flying but with shitty graphics !, 
  actually it 's three words '' \u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03a0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd '' and the correlation between * ' \u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03a0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd ' * and * ` istanbul ' * is n't very obvious at first glance . 
  like * ` hold the door ' * became * ` hodor ' * !, 
  i remember stories of an old elderly neighbor i had saying `` there is n't such a city as istanbul , you mean constantinople . '', 
  it 's a little silly , i know , but at least during the 60s it was a thing . 
  also , ca n't count the number of * `` no , it 's not kebab , it 's gyros and it 's greek '' * fights on the internet i 've witnessed in my life !, 
  this seems to be working better than calling istanbul , constantinople !, 
  some turks really call istanbul , constantinople ( or constantiniye , which i think means the same ) ? 
  interesting . 
  the only reasons we call it constantinople is a ) this name is now part of our tradition and b ) to piss you off after the tensions we had during the 50s and 60s ( the istanbul pogrom ) . 
  fun fact : we switched from calling turkish coffee , greek coffee for the same reason . 
  that 's something greek nationalists wo n't look forward to . 
  since everyone in greece calls istanbul , constantinople ( except for some leftists . 
  you 're too conservative for them if you call it constantinople ) i propose we make it a thing internationally only to piss erdogan off . 
  edit : # 1453neverforget #triggered, 
   will be ready in approximately 20 years . 
  well , they 're too optimistic . 
  wait until we get there and find the secret nazi base on the dark side of the moon . 
  ( iron sky , anyone ? ), 
  no , i wo n't march into right-wing parties to find friends , but if i make a friend who supports a right-wing party , then what 's the problem ? 
  i do n't have an outgroup-ingroup mentality . 
  i only said that it 's idiotic to label a whole group of people racist xenophobes when they make it clear they are not racists and xenophobes , only conservatives and anti-multiculturalists . 
  there is a difference between being against the uncontrolled mixing of cultures and being a legit racist . 
  all racists are against the mixing of cultures , but not all anti-multiculturalists are racist . 
  if you 're gon na criticize someone , criticize him for the right reasons . 
  uk government should start an inquiry on ~ ~ weather ~ ~ wether water makes you wet . 
  edit : spelling . 
  thanks u/usagii _ yo, 
  it 's interesting to see switzerland in the first place , considering all these wars they 've fought . 
  i have been downvoted for less controversial things than that . 
  cheers !, 
  yes , bands like `` endless recovery , '' `` convixion , '' `` no flame candle , '' `` ruthless steel '' ( although they have moved to sweden and changed their name ) and some newer ones like `` fyrecross , '' and `` crystal wings '' ( all friends of mine ) . 
  basically all the bands under the `` eat metal records '' label and many others under the `` no remorse records '' label . 
  they are all a circle of friends/acquaintances . 
  yes , i remember . 
  i used to read it to when i was in high school . 
  but got bored eventually because it seemed like they wrote about the same subjects again and again . 
  i still have some old issues and check them out from time to time . 
  i do n't know how the society would be in such a case , but i know debates would be much more stimulating and interesting . 
  the official religion is a dying corpse , really . 
  from what i 've seen there are a lot of young people that are not necessarily irreligious , but not christians and definitely not fans of the church . 
  everyone ticks the `` christian '' box because they either do n't care about religion , so they rather call themselves christians , or they believe that christianity is too deeply rooted into our current history ( since the 19th century ) so they would say things like * `` i 'm not really a christian , but our forefathers were , and out nation was build on this religion , so since i believe in a god i 'm going by it . 
  '' * , and finally we have the christians , practicing or not , who believe in christianity . 
  as people have said above , the actual believers are a slight majority , and the practicing believers are a considerate minority . 
  atheists try to advertise themselves as an alternative , but they get such a backlash from this slight christian majority , that undecided , doubtful people do n't really want to associate with them . 
  you 're talking of what i call `` metal hammer monthly readers '' type of metal fans . 
  i 'm talking mostly on the people in the underground scene . 
  there you have people who live `` the metal way of life '' and not your average teenager who will stop listening to metal when he discovers that there are women in his university !, 
  i do n't think greeks in greece should do everything in a greek way !, 
  ( downvotes incoming ! ), 
  the danish people 's party is a right-wing party , right ? 
  i do n't like how right-wing parties , which are more concerned about culture rather than race , are still called racist . 
  if you 're going to criticize something or someone ( which you should ) at least do it right . 
  cheers man !, 
  well when i 'm referring to `` backwards greek mentality '' i 'm talking about things like driving like an asshole , or having loud conversations in public , or living beyond one 's means . 
  i wo n't start talking very loudly in public just because we do that in greece , for example , or i will never ask a friend or a family member to give a job just for the shake of our friendship or our relation respectively . 
  but of course i will serve mousaka if i invite you to my place , celebrate our national holidays , keep our little customs ( not the annoying ones ) , etc. 
  i will get out of my way to learn good danish even if i stay there for a couple of years , participate in their traditions and assimilate . 
  edit : some spelling, 
  i have a question .
