  we should n't prosecute people for saying hateful stuff in public , but we should shut down mosques that spread jihad . 
  thankfully , the fruitcakes are just a vocal minority . 
  it would n't be as funny if a lot of people start finding these things reasonable !, 
  so edgy for a german !, 
  if you ask radical feminists , [ looking at girls is stare rape ] ( http://www.titleixforall.com/goshen-college-declares-all-male-students-who-stare-at-women-are-rapists/ ) . 
  that could work for future refugee arrivals , but for the ~ 60,000 who are already in greece , and god knows how many there are in italy , we should install checkpoints ( or hotspots ) inside the eu . 
  otherwise , it would n't make sense to ship them elsewhere , process their requests , and ship the accepted ones back . 
  the eu promised to provide us with assistance to do that job , but hardly any reached greece . 
  no problem !, 
  ** greece ** yesterday morning a group of anarchists [ interrupted mass in thesaloniki ] ( http://en.protothema.gr/extreme-anti-authoritarian-group-bursts-into-thessaloniki-church-interrupting-liturgy/ ) and threw flyers in protest of resent events , where members of the same group were thrown out of a building - which was property of the church - that they were occupying and housed refugees inside . 
  a few days ago , also in thessaloniki , police forces forced out of another building members of the same ( ? ), 
  group , which they had also occupied illegally . 
  [ the governing party rooted for the anarchists ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2016/07/28/syriza-vs-syriza-on-issue-of-occupation-of-vacant-buildings/ ) and , in an official statement , said that the police forces stood in the way of solidarity ( refugee families were also housed in that building ) and this did not comply with the left 's principles . 
  also , [ there is a big fire raging nw of athens ] ( http://en.protothema.gr/euboea-wildfire-still-threatens-town/ ) and a town is on stand by for evacuation should the need arise . 
  the atmosphere in athens is heavy : smoke from the fire , burning sun and extreme heat . 
  big nope . 
  ancaps and islamists are completely incomparable . 
  my point is that political islam is much more relevant and popular than anarcho-capitalism . 
  besides , [ sharia courts already exist in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/application_of_islamic_law_by_country#europe ) . 
  is it moral to have parallel legal systems ? 
  tensions have already arose among immigrants/refugees and greeks in the islands . 
  the reason for this is that there are simply not enough resources to cater for the residents , refugees , and tourists ( even if they are n't many of those ) , and immigrants/refugees do n't always shake their shoulders saying `` eh , we understand . '', 
  many of them are outraged ( and understandably so ) and end up rioting and causing trouble . 
  the problem is n't that the rafts sneak up on our navy . 
  the thing is that , from the moment that a 12-person boat is filled with 40 refugees and it capsizes , you ca n't just let everyone drown , you have a moral obligation to save them . 
  after you have saved them , you are bound by legal treaties ( iirc ) to shelter these people and assess their asylum requests , etc , you ca n't just throw them back where they came from , and even if you could , turkey would n't accept them . 
   unless we can bring this conversation to the middle , the extreme right will keep winning over the silent majority which is constantly told `` shut up '' ( or something ending with phobia ) by the current `` progressive '' `` elites '' . 
  exactly . 
  the situation is a lot more complex than `` all muslims are terrorists '' and `` criticizing islam is gross and racist . '', 
  unfortunately , i get flak from both sides ( more so from the left ) . 
  nope . 
  he was pretty radical and went to prison because of that . 
  are n't religion and culture correlated though ? 
  for a lot of religious people , religion is n't just the sky daddy of their preference , but a guide of living and , inevitably , part of their culture . 
  i think that muslims in europe have adopted the western culture and are just believers , whereas muslims in the middle east consider islam to be part of their culture . 
  nah , sounds like turkish food to me . 
   `` political islam introducing sharia law in a western democracy '' is not one of them . 
  well , it 's not at the moment ( and maybe it 'll never be ) , but you ca n't deny that there is at least a minority of muslims that want political islam to be established . 
  stop foreign funded mosques ? 
  muslims call out other muslims to reform islam ? 
  media recognize the distinction between the normal , liberal , western muslims and is jihadists ? 
  these are actually pretty good reactions . 
  and i thought all sanity was lost !, 
  * translated by google translate ^ ^ tm *, 
  as if that was n't obvious enough . 
  saudi arabia is n't a progressive dreamland , why would anyone * not * think that letting it financing mosques in foreign countries , is a bad idea ? 
  a lot of jews believe it , but how many execute it ? 
  have you seen any jewish suicide bombers ? 
  have you seen a zionist jewish theocratic state that has the old testament as its core principle and its law is the law of the ot ? 
  similarly , how many black people are terrorists ? 
  i mean , black panthers style paramilitary members that want to kill non-blacks ? 
  you could say some blm activists certainly want to do so , and one even has , but where is your mass shootings by black people * in the name of an ideology * . 
  there is huge criminality inside black ghettos , and it is in no way comparable to islamic terrorism . 
  the fucking flu kills more people than muslims do . 
  so does that make islamic terrorism a non-issue ? 
  is it ok if terrorist attacks keep on happening until we eradicate the flu , and then we should move on to the next biggest cause of death ? 
  i 'm an atheist , and i can say shit about christianity all day and nobody will bat an eye , but when i criticize islam the responses that i get ** from other atheists ** are like yours : `` buh , buh cristianity is just as bad , '' `` you 're a racist , '' `` islam it 's a different culture , you ca n't judge a different culture because you 're biased by yours , '' and other post-modern , post-structuralistic horseshit . 
  black people and jews are n't radicals that want to wage holy war on innocent civilians . 
  yes , that negative karma is a bit too much for a hasty logical jump . 
  it 's not that the guy is an islam apologist , or one of those who say that criticizing islam is racist . 
  seems that a lot of people were just as hasty to interpret it as such . 
  for argument 's shake though , if isis only has 100,000 supporters , that still 0.006 % of the muslim population . 
  but even if that 's true , it does n't account for the sharia-wanting islamists and other sympathizers , or other muslims that are shia but equally as sharia-wanting conservative muslims . 
  that 's cultural relativism for you . 
  for some reason , criticism is n't welcome - to say the least - , because there are n't better or worse cultures , only different ones . 
  ( islamist values are , of course , part of their culture ) . 
   he was `` proud to be aryan '' since he was of mixed nationality ( iranian-german ) he was proud to be [ both actual aryan and nazi pseudoscience aryan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aryan#contemporary_usage )  the last two are not mentioned in the article i just added the information one of them was an 18 y/o muslim greek from the muslim minority in northen greece, 
  at leas in greek media it was mentioned here and there . 
  i thought we got passed the `` video games cause violence '' bs and went on to `` video games are sexist '' bs . 
  are you sure ? 
  i think they got a hefty fine and a threat from the judge that if he sees them again ( meaning to continue being critical of immigration ) he 'll appoint prison sentences . 
  why did you make the assumption that every mosque should be raided ? 
  wahhabism mosques should . 
  every mosque for which there is sufficient evidence that radicalization takes place in it should . 
  and you obviously pulled the statistic out of your arse . 
  i doubt that all of them were mentally ill . 
  were japanese kamikazes mentally ill , for example ? 
  it 's not newspeak , per se , but you ca n't deny that the media avoid mentioning wahhabism ( which is a terrible ideology/islam interpretation ) and instead say `` oh , he was mentally ill , '' `` he was bullied , '' `` he was a victim of racist attacks , '' etc. 
  dare criticize religion ? 
  no , that 's racist !, 
  malia know !, 
  let 's make a pigs union and trade with each other . 
  and we 'll be sending photos of us drinking at the beach to the rest of the eu . 
  sure , we 've got plenty of homemade ouzo ^ ^ but ^ ^ not ^ ^ taxed . 
  ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ tell ^ ^ the ^ ^ germans !, 
  hey , english brothers welcome . 
  come , come , have some ouzo !, 
  i do n't think they knew all these stuff in the middle ages . 
  edit : spelling, 
  well , site 's name checks out !, 
  to be fair though , this was execution by the sword , not guillotine . 
  soo ... the us are extreme !, 
  madrid - toledo . 
  it was n't always a walk in the park , but generally much better than greece . 
  only the peaks are -20 . 
  right ? 
  over here , people lose their minds if the temperature reaches 0 . 
  i think that 's obvious . 
  you ca n't compare ira with isis . 
  i live close to ~ ~ the sea ~ ~ a crappy commercial port , so the humidity is pretty high .
