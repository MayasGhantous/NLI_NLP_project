yeah , the greek name is papadopoulos/ou , which roughly mean 's `` priest 's child '' . 
   ... so how many percent support golden dawn ? 
  two days from now , you 'll have a better picture . 
   why should the eu support such a country ? 
  sonny , i do n't know on what planet you live , [ but you might wan na read up about fascists and neo-nazis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neo-nazism ) , especially in europe . 
  when i get on my computer , i might bother giving you more than a wikipedia link . 
  i hope it 's worth the effort . 
   we do n't want countries that support nazis what are you even talking about ... 
  if i were uninformed , i 'd imagine hitler has been reborn in hungary/greece from your inane comments . 
  did i say we are disadvantaged ? 
  what i said is that you are lucky * for not having \u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 . 
  * you said we should be grateful for having this option , but it 's not an option . 
  it 's a necessity of sorts ; i 've certainly never heard of anyone not paying for \u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 and getting good grades . 
  the system , as it currently is , is not really `` free education '' . 
  as i understand , you do n't have to pay for secondary education , do you ? 
  this is an advantage , though i guess your description of your schools are pretty much the same as ours , so i can only conclude you have better textbooks/faculty w/e . 
  not particularly . 
  i do n't know the specifics of all courses and their exams etc , but let me give you an idea : * maths : kinda like calculus i in uni ( i 'm in a cs dept. 
  ) , though easier and much less rigorous . 
  * physics : you 're called to basically learn by heart a collection of exercises and theorems . 
  mostly kinematics and mechanical oscillations . 
  * modern greek : also called '' \u0395\u03ba\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b7 '' ( essay in greek ) , the course revolves around writing a small essay of a few hundred words , random subject . 
  very controversial lesson in my experience , because the essay is often an opinion piece , leading teachers to give wildly varying grades . 
  clarification : two teachers grade each exam , with a third one called in if there 's a wide variance between grades . 
  this happens in modern greek quite often . 
  * history : have to learn by heart a large portion of the textbook . 
  word for word . 
  the main difficulty is that the school teachers and the textbooks used there * do not cover the entire curriculum of each course * . 
  it 's lack of time , as teachers are given something like 2-4 hours/week for some of the above courses , whereas \u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 can do twice the number of hours . 
  often , the teachers there are much more skilled or rather ... interested , in doing their job . 
   except we do n't go to \u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 you 're probably lucky for that , as \u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 can cost well over 3k , or at least used to , in my time . 
  you see , they cleverly exploit the fact that kids who 're gon na give finals pretty much * need * those extra lessons/help , so they charge much higher rates per hour than they do for younger kids . 
  what metaphor ? 
  and no , you ca n't really negotiate your social contract , that 's the whole point . 
  you give up some freedoms in exchange for the bettering of the whole , and that happens when you 're born . 
  nowadays , any `` renegotiation '' of terms , requires many mediators and there 's little way for your voice to be heard , unless you actually have some kind of power over others . 
   the current crop of children has nothing to do with it , and it 's a massive issue they 'll be saddled with if it is n't resolved . 
  thank you for that , because i do belong in the generation immediately prior to our current one . 
  seeing as i 'm still in university and have only voted on two governments , i ca n't really see myself as responsible , however much i find myself saddled with the responsibility , both online and not . 
  if we were to generalize the issue across an entire generation , those responsible for it would be the baby boomers and the succeeding generation . 
  such a generalization would be a bit wrong however . 
  interestingly , between the '60s and the 70s , greece was in a pretty good spot [ economically ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_economic_miracle ) ( and a terrible one [ politically ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_military_junta_of_1967%e2%80%9374 ) , but that 's another story ) . 
  like / u/mhntonpaizeis said , this is n't about `` belief '' . 
  everybody hates this disgusting situation with bribes , etc. 
  some decide to stop being a part of it , and simply do n't give or take the [ fakelaki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fakelaki ) . 
  many however , simply ca n't avoid it . 
  when a loved one is in a hospital , and needs immediate care , many if not most people will give bribes , in order to ensure proper treatment reaches their beloved person . 
  there are many cases when the bribe can be * necessary * , for example , during the initial process to become a pensioner . 
  as a personal anecdote : my father had to wait for * almost three years * to begin getting his own . 
  this is absolutely preposterous , but if you are unwilling to * pay some money to the right people * to move your application faster , this is how long you 'll have to wait . 
  legally , you ca n't work during this time , so you must have some other source of income if you have to survive . 
  his rant perfectly answers that . 
   corruption , tax avoidance , government incompetence if greece can not be trusted , then politicians of previous governments * that are responsible of the quoted failings * ** should not be endorsed ** by germany and other european leaders or powerful personae . 
   a population which is ready to vote in a party the populace , as proven , has not voted for any such parties , since there has n't been any increase in pensions/benefits recently ( if anything , pension age has been increased ! ) . 
  the latest one was voted in office with the expectation of toning down on austerity measures ( perhaps with a populist spin but that 's irrelevant here ) , yet has done nothing of the sort , yet . 
  what ? 
  are you for real ? 
  the current generation of people was , more or less , born during the previous decade , the 2000s . 
  obviously , these people are still children , and ca n't be held responsible for * indebting a country * . 
  even the previous generation ( who would be those born mid 80s to early 90s ) ca n't be held responsible . 
  this generation generally began voting during the early 2000s , which means they ca n't have really affected the greek economy sufficiently to get the country in this situation . 
  thanks you man , you said something i 've always wanted to say eloquently and succintly . 
  many people are voicing opinions here and else on reddit that are completely irellevant without understanding greece and the context here . 
  i ca n't claim to understand all the economics/politics at hand here , or the consequences that may come from each of the two options , but both choices , especially the no vote , * are very understandable * . 
   a well informed populace unfortunately , given recent media shenanigans in greece , you 'll never get proper information without each citizen researching the issues personally , which will be done by a very small percentage of the overall population . 
   i am fairly certain that the german media is not outright lying as i do n't know german , i ca n't just check them out and see for myself . 
  but given how the greek media are acting ( this is a global issue in truth , apparent everywhere , but this is a different story ) , i 'm not going to suddenly begin trusting the word of one stranger on the validity of german reporting . 
   conspiracy theories why play that card right away when you were told about lying press/media ? 
  i 'm greek , and i do n't know about germany , but the press is certainly one of the most corrupt of all sectors . 
  as far as i 've seen , there is almost zero coverage on what the referendum is about , which is a no or a yes at the set of measures proposed earlier by juncker or whoever . 
  i consider this * lying * . 
   i have a hard time placing more blame at syriza 's feet than theirs , and i 'm not very politically-aligned with syriza 's goals at all . 
  which is wise . 
   greece was in a pretty bad state already due to decades more like three decades . 
  pretty much an oligarchy . 
  power 's been swapped between a pair of families and the douches surrounding them for a while , seemingly until now . 
  what does that have to do with anything ? 
  that 's extremely common in what is called [ greeklish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greeklish ) , which is often used online by greeks . 
  if you take a look at the wiki page provided , you 'll notice that exact transliteration along with example phrases etc. 
  according to the standard iso 843 for transliterating greek characters , \u03be = x. sound-wise , you are correct , ks would also sound appropriate . 
  the greek letter x / \u03c7 is transliterated as ch according to the same standard , though kh is also common in my experience ( the \u039f\u03a7\u0399 example is a good one ) . 
  even funnier , the article says :  ... [ he ] refers to the assaults on new year 's eve in cologne , stating that he 's here to `` protect women 's rights '' . 
  then proceeds to add the picture with him eating off her back lmao . 
  the situation is something you can be totally mad about , agreed . 
  i 've just seen people being * actually * mad at the mayor on facebook . 
  seeing similar comments on reddit confirmed to me that people actually did n't know what she was talking about . 
   women are oppressed if they have to avoid crowds women should n't have to fear entering a crowd , but in general , avoiding a large , packed crowd * is never a bad idea * . 
  sex does n't matter . 
  there could be pickpockets , etc in there . 
  the advice given also spoke about keeping an `` arm 's length '' distance between you and others : this is * basic * advice meant to ensure you keep your personal space under control . 
  if someone gets inside that space , it 's wise to be aware and on attention , and again , it does n't matter if you 're a man or a woman . 
  reading comprehension failing . 
  she was asked a question and answered adequately . 
  yes , the question was stupid , in that you do n't need to ask the freaking mayor over safety advice , but her answer was * not wrong * and i do n't personally find it offensive . 
  there was n't much else to say , and all the blowback over this particular sentence is completely unnecessary . 
  there are other people that should be blamed for this situation . 
  i am not really educated on the matter , nor do i necessarily disagree with you -- the request is a bit silly . 
  but are you insinuating that turkey is `` right '' ** to violate national airspace with armed aircraft ** ... because of a 4 mile dispute ? 
  i hope not , because that 's * preposterous . 
   but if turkey really did violate greece 's airspace with a fully loaded bomber during a bombing sortie and greece reacted within it 's international rights , then yes , greece can do that .
