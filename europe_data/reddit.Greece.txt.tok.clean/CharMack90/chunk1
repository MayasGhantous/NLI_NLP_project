they 've substituted turkish cypriots with anatolian turks . 
  that 's pretty much it . 
  multiple turkish governments have tried to populate cyprus with turks from the mainland for the last 50 + years , but that has n't done much to alter the island 's original population makeup . 
  more turkish cypriots immigrate to turkey , the uk , australia , etc , than mainland turks to cyprus . 
  i originally thought it was peculiar as well , but i think it 's supposed to mirror the [ kingdom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_hanover ) and later [ province ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/province_of_hanover ) of hanover . 
  yes , you 're right . 
  plus , it 's a proper chinese and japanese co-production . 
  the director is chinese , but watanabe works as the show 's supervisor . 
  i agree . 
  * south denmark * makes more sense . 
  his healthcare plan seemed more promising as he proposed it . 
  the obamacare that americans got was what was left of the original plan after a gop-majority senate went ballistic on it and picked out many parts that would make it more effective . 
  the us government has been pushing private healthcare to all americans for a long time . 
  there 's too much money to gain from it and there 's no way they 'll achieve universal healthcare anytime soon . 
  that 's still a 1 % drop per year . 
  that 's a lot for a country with an emerging economy . 
  the singing part is both startling and hillarious !, 
  you mean the newspaper ? 
  the first syllable is pronounced closer to * `` joom '' * , thankfully . 
  i 'm okay with being controlled by istanbul . 
  as long as it is n't in turkish hands . 
  yes , i admit that the civil war cases probably should n't count as `` helping '' the country . 
  thankfully , he seems to have backtracked on that one . 
  a gop-majority senate that still supports the use of fossil fuels is more worrisome , imo .

  i always liked goulash more than bisque ... ^ ^ eyes ^ ^ up ^ ^ / u/istencsaszar, 
  that 's not entirely true . 
  you were helped during the finnish civil war by the german empire as well as swedish , estonian , and polish volunteers . 
  you were alone during the winter war because you chose neutrality and you were forced to ally with nazi germany during the continuation war to fend off the soviets ( even though that came to bite you in the ass during the lapland war ) . 
  thing is , you were never part of a strong allied coalition of armies . 
  the eu could achieve that and have a joint army and defence policy extended towards all its members . 
  this army will be obligated ( in accordance to eu law ) to defend finland as much as any other member state . 
  the safety of our borders and an intact eu territory will be priority no1 for an eu army . 
  yeah , your wording there was a bit odd . 
  i 'm sorry i mistook your input . 
   in any case , it 's good to remind people of what 's going on and not letting the same lies echoing all around . 
  fair point . 
  seriously , finland ? 
  you share a 1,340 km long border with russia , you are n't part of nato * and * you are n't interested in joint eu defence policy ? 
  are you really * that * confident in your own army ? 
  i can make one out of an avocado , an ice-pick , and a snorkel . 
  of course they are . 
  greece has very strict gun laws . 
  this does n't stop the black market , though . 
   i 've seen quite a few countries and in none of them people earned money by doing nothing and being lazy . 
  that 's another myth . 
  statistics show that greeks have been consistently among the hardest working europeans with more working hours and fewer paid vacations than the germans or the french . 
  you can blame the debt policy , the political corruption , and even lots of people retiring at their 50s , but you ca n't propagate the `` greeks earned money by doing nothing and being lazy '' bullcrap , because it has simply never been true . 
  it has also been widely known for many years that eu member-countries paid to salvage the european * banks * , not the people of greece . 
  only about 5 % of that money went to the state and the people of the country . 
  the greeks were used as a scapegoat to be blamed for a massive problem because it was easy for european governments to do so . 
  they just let people assume that this was the deal . 
  i still remember how - at the start of the 2008 crisis - a great amount of europeans actually thought that the ez economy went down * because * of greece . 
  i confirm that . 
  anti-german sentiment comes and goes since wwii started ( maybe even before that ) , but hatred towards france has n't ever been a thing around here . 
  in the uk as a whole , yes . 
  but only about 15,1 in england . 
  new england 's population is about 14,7 million . 
  england 's population that voted for brexit is about 15,1 million . 
  that 's close enough . 
  we could arrange a swap . 
  it looks like an oil painting . 
  you think you 'll get downvoted because you eloquently verbalised your concerns about russia 's politics ? 
  in * this * sub ? 
  welcome to / r/europe . 
  you must be new here ... 
  they probably decided going for something neutral that could work with either candidate winning the presidency . 
  i mean , we have baklava , but we do n't really call it `` original '' greek cuisine . 
  it 's traditional , because it 's been made for generations , but we recognise its middle eastern origin . 
  well , three of them are in their late-70s / early-80s , so let 's hope they do n't retire , resign , or die in the next 4 years ( especially considering two of those were appointed by a democratic president ) . 
   gay `` marriage '' was a supreme court ruling . 
  i doubt trump will have the political capital to overturn that . 
  the supreme court judges are nominated by the president and confirmed by the senate . 
  that 's probably right . 
  many people commented on how trump-sanders-hrc were like rock-paper-scissors . 
  you 're partially right , because i did n't specify . 
  i meant urban planning and architecture-wise . 
  the amount of beautiful historic buildings , streets , and monuments italy has is crazy high . 
  it may be because we did n't have the artistic explosion of the renaissance ( damn you , ottomans !, 
  ) , but we do n't really have any cities , towns , or villages as wonderfully planned , built and maintained as italy . 
  and even then , a greek 10 will be an italian 8 ( at best ) . 
  greece looks like a turd compared to italy . 
  can italy just chill the fuck out and stop being this gorgeous ? 
  it 's getting annoying . 
  well , they 're based on representative voting through the electoral college , so of course they 're rigged . 
  they 've always been . 
  yes . 
  well , * rain or snow  rain and snow * , that 's for sure .

  plz do n't . 
  americans put their national identity above their ethnic identity , though . 
  an irish-american may feel connected to his/her roots in ireland , but they still consider themselves first and foremost * american * . 
  most turks in germany are n't like that .
