  almost no student pays attention and it needs a very low amount of effort to pass a test on it . 
  the major issue is the wasted time . 
  either religion lessons become more informative and challenging for students or we remove them from the curriculum altogether . 
  have a spine and not run his entire election campaign on lies would be a good start . 
  more or less . 
  though he was eurosceptic , but not pro-grexit . 
  and now he 's the biggest eu slut there is . 
  i 'm still not sure whether these incidents have increased since brexit or simply media reporting them more often to cash in . 
  because he presented himself ( lied ) as a change and he 's the leader of a party that is n't one of the two that have ruled since 1974 . 
  greek people gave him a chance to do something good for this nation and he shat all over it . 
  hopefully , greeks wo n't be as moronic next time they vote . 
  no , it does n't really . 
  there 's lots of controlled deer-culling in britain and ireland . 
  certain regions , like the scottish highlands , have had serious issues because there are no natural predatorsto lower the overbreeding of red deer . 
  there 's serious damage to local plant-life because of that . 
  lots of organisations and politicians of the british isles have tried to reintroduce wolves and lynxes to deal with that problem . 
  top kek . 
  it 's quite unfair to the french , because the us owns part of its independent existence to france . 
  if the british were n't so busy fighting france in europe and france ( mostly driven by revenge after the seven years ' war ) did n't get itself an alliance with the american revolutionaries , then the us would possibly be another commonwealth nation in the present . 
  something similar to canada . 
  but the * real * questions is : if vanilla hungarians are a thing , then which hungarians * are n't * considered vanilla ? 
  what beef do the kiwis have with the frogs ? 
   right after they torched the entire city of izmir that was the turks . 
  because it was n't `` the entire city '' . 
  it was the greek and armenian quarters , while the turkish and jewish quarters were left [ unscathed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_fire_of_smyrna ) . 
  in what world does it make sense for people to burn down their own houses and businesses ? 
  what kind of unhistorical bullcrap they are teaching you in your schools , i 'll never know ... 
  are n't you making big dough out of them , though ? 
  i know * we * are ... 
  the same thing can be said about european portuguese and brazilian portuguese . 
  or castilian spanish and latin-american spanish . 
  it 's common to have different dialects and idioms of the same language . 
  differences in vocabulary and grammar * do * exist , but if the variants are still [ mutual intelligible ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mutual_intelligibility ) then they 're considered part of the same language . 
  pretty much all linguists agree that serbian , croatian , bosnian , and montenegrin are all the same language . 
  that 's why they usually prefer using terms like * shtokavian * , * chakavian * , etc that transpass borders and show what a [ pluricentric language ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pluricentric_language#serbo-croatian ) it is . 
   [ ... ] turkey faces a teacher gap of 130,000 , according to `` cumhuriyet '' newspaper . 
  there are concerns that in a bid to quickly fill the education gap the government may hire unqualified and inexperienced teachers . 
  were n't there supposed to be thousands of unemployed teachers in line to get a job ? 
  yes , the cia was involved in the coup d'\u00e9tat of 1967 . 
  i did n't say russia is innocent ; just that the us is more guilty . 
  it 's like a eyeless man accusing a one-eyed man of blindness . 
  i have not the slightest `` romanticised vision '' of the ussr and i 'm glad we dodged that ball . 
  we fought a civil war to make sure communism would n't be a thing in my country , and that happened as soon as we got out of a messy and bloody wwii . 
  you would n't say you prefer the cia over kgb if you were latin american , iranian , or turkish . 
  you * do n't * make it democratic . 
  its existence is undemocratic by default . 
  but other countries ' intelligence agencies are used for collecting data to protect the country and ensure its safety . 
  unlike cia who is , among other things , directly responsible for toppling democratically elected governments of * other * nations for the interests of the us . 
  the fact that such an official state-approved organisation exists in the first place gives the us and any us ally no right to judge russia 's interests and use of intelligence agencies . 
  let 's not be hypocritical about it . 
  for stupid people no less . 
  exactly . 
  cia is the most undemocratic and nation-destructive foreign intelligence agency to have ever existed . 
  kgb and fsb would hope to be half as effective . 
  if the americans are free to promote their national interests in a foul manner with the blessings of the state , then what 's to stop russia ( or any other country ) from doing the same ? 
  we 've got a thousand different reasons to blame russia for all sorts of things , but this is a typical `` russia = bad '' anecdote . 
  i thought about that , but i did n't want to deplete the swedes from gothenburg too . 
  it 's only fair to allow them access to the north sea . 
  the norwegians and the finnish can figure out what to do with the sami issue . 
  maybe combine the lapplands and sami-majority municipalities and make an autonomous region ( like the faroe islands are to denmark ) that transpasses borders . 
  i like how iberia almost always smashes the east-west divide in these maps . 
  [ is this good enough ? 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hfdtuef.png ) everybody gets to have a large piece of swedish pie , while sweden gets to keep 8/10 of its largest cities , so that 's something ... ^ / jk, 
  poles do n't go to russia . 
  [ russia comes to them ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/curzon_line_en.svg/563px-curzon_line_en.svg.png ) . 
  there was an annoying kerfuffle at the start of the century about it . 
  the government took the religion out of id cards ( according to personal data protection law ) and a rally was launched by the church who wanted to bring it back . 
  although it had lots of popular support , it was n't politically successful , thankfully . 
  less fun with what ? 
  do n't leave a sarcastic sentence hanging . 
  yeah , if it was a matter of pure logic , `` does n't know '' would have been way higher . 
  illegal immigrants comprise less than 0.5 % of japan 's population . 
  they 're in no right to `` warn '' anyone . 
  that 's understandable , but it 's always better to raise the bar a little higher . 
  welp ... it was good for the week that it lasted . 
  * 9 scandals of greek banks !, 
  number 7 will shock you !, 
  yeah , probably because [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/league_of_nations_mandate ) happened . 
   but what are we , as a single state , supposed to do exactly , especially when the departing countries do n't want them back ? 
  let them die in the sea , sink their boats ? 
  exactly !, 
  that 's the most aggravating finger-pointing northern european individuals and organisations do towards us too . 
  `` if only greece could protect their own borders and not let migrants in ... '' they think that guarding the sea is as easy as guarding the land borders . 
  we ca n't put fences there . 
  we ca n't block any arriving boats unless we had a million ships and lined them up across our external waters . 
  we ca n't apprehend refugees and turn them back to turkey either because we would have to breach their own borders to do so and that 's a clear * casus belli * . 
  letting them pass and registering them is the only solution that does n't include painting the aegean red with their blood ... 
  actually , the [ fertility rate of europe ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ezaiuzq.png ) is pretty messy and does n't make much sense from an economical standpoint . 
  was the place bombed during wwii ? 
  oh yeah , i completely agree . 
  political and social revolutions pushed nations into secularism and christianity needed to comply . 
  islam , on the other hand , was all cozed up and protected by law in sultanates that never had the same revolutions ( at least not in the same intensity ) to force the religion to evolve and adapt . 
  look at turkey . 
  it 's the best example of a secularist country with a muslim majority we 've got , but it 's still nowhere near the level of most western nations while its social revolution happened less than a century ago . 
  i 've had all sorts of straw man replies on reddit , but this one beats them all . 
  oh norway , let it go , wo n't you ... ? 
  it 's more of a national interest than spite . 
  countries are egotistical and self-important . 
  who knew ... 
  were n't they the ones who blacklisted certain wikipedia articles a couple of years back ?
