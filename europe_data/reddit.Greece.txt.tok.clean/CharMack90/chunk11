  he also prevented the sell and use of contraceptives and made abortions illegal , right ? 
  plus , couples who had multiple children were rewarded special benefits , which was a solid incentive for some people to have a couple extra children . 
  to my knowledge , though , most couples did n't bother with it and the plan largely failed . 
  it 's true that improving the quality of life includes better education and job advancement , which usually result in fewer births and more people interested in their carrers . 
  i 'll admit there 's no certain answer , but `` going out to meet someone '' can not be a serious government 's official response on the matter . 
  so , janosik is the real and better version of robin hood . 
  then why are we still interested in that limey fairytale when we have the real deal to talk about ? 
  who is `` robin hood '' ? 
  is he the sherwood janosik ? 
  i agree . 
  simple issue with monetary union without fiscal union . 
  you ca n't expect the economies of greece or portugal to compete with the economies of france or germany while using the same currency . 
  there have been way too many economic analysts who 've been raving about how stupid of an idea the euro is . 
  the eurozone has had `` bad news '' written all over it since its conception . 
  forcing people to reproduce is like forbidding them to jerk off . 
  there 's no way in hell that 's gon na work . 
  the only way to make people reproduce more is by fixing the economy and improving their quality of life . 
  the [ religious policy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sikh_empire#religious_policy ) of the sikh empire , although not perfect , was still a wonder by 19th century standards . 
  and then the british came ... [ edit : * not necessarily a bad thing * ], 
   the modern kaliningrad sewage plant , delayed for years , should be operating by the end of this year ( 2016 ) . 
  the most recent [ article ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/world/europe/russias-separate-piece-sets-off-alarms-about-a-cold-war-revival.html?_r=0 ) i could find ( april 16 , 2016 ) . 
  equating modern islam with medieval christianity does n't really justify islam . 
  if anything , it shows christianity evolved , while islam stagnated . 
  either that or they could n't communicate to make a decision , so they just gave up . 
  do n't you mean : * triiggeerreed * ? 
  it is . 
  or at least that 's how it started before moving on to everyday life . 
  and , by the way , it 's `` break ** a ** leg '' . 
  `` break ** your ** leg '' sounds more like a threat . 
  now all we need is for australia to write and perform a song called `` sach sach sachertorte '' . 
  szombat comes from `` sabbath '' through proto-slavic `` s\u01ebbota '' . 
   i 'm surprised we never adapted to spanish or some other style . 
  that was your system of day names in old portuguese ( l\u0169es , martes , mercores , joves , vernes , sabado , domingo ) . 
  it was the catholic church that changed the `` pagan names '' of the days into the current ones in the 15th century . 
  the upper half of the greek ones are okay . 
  shame we 'll never find out about the bottom halves . 
   i am not antisemitic but gypsies are a large problem in hungary i did n't know gypsies were jews . 
  it 's a state channel . 
  they just need a visual example to showcase what the government 's doing to us . 
  a * low * country , perhaps ? 
  patagonia is full of ethnic croats . 
  i hear bathing in the blood of infants works ... 
   that was mostly true for bucharest with transylvanians having a more sane attittude about it . 
  [ peach people vs coconut people ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jun/14/change-your-life-peaches-and-coconuts-oliver-burkeman ), 
  it 's just a prank , bro ... 
  linguistically , it makes more sense for luxembourg to be with germany . 
  or france , since french has more official power and it 's the preferred language of the government . 
  belgium too , i guess ... 
  did n't you know you 're directly responsible for every political decision your country ever made since its establishment ? 
  maybe we should enforce some sort of inheritance tax on the corpse 's relatives . 
  if you do n't pay up in a specific amount of time , the cadaver belongs to the state . 
  better get to it quickly though , if you 're planning to have an open casket funeral ... ^ / s, 
  very likely ; not gon na deny it . 
  well-balanced mediterranean cuisine , healthy amounts of good wine , and lack of stress . 
  there . 
  that 's the `` secret '' . 
  you 're right . 
  [ it 's slim , trim and ready for the gym .

  a lithuanian friend of mine told me that kaunas is the true capital of anything lithuanian in lithuania , the same way istanbul is of turkey or saint petersburg of russia . 
  he was exaggerating , of course , but i think i see his point . 
  i reckon it 's the same sort of `` humiliating '' as when a spoiled rich lady is offered tap water instead of bottled evian . 
  [ i mean ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_council ), 
  * laughs in ~ ~ spanish ~ ~ turkish *, 
  with a 29 % corporate tax , we could n't even see their shadows here .

  `` strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government . '', 
  the would n't have elections either , but that 's besides the point ...

  i mean , it 's a pretty flag . 
  that `` ever-closer union '' , though is a midsummer night 's dream/nightmare the whole world would need to go topsy-turvy for even 1/10 of eu member states to agree uniting and going federal . 
  eu officials are either blind or idiots to see the `` united states of europe '' as a possible outcome in this century . 
  so do the chinese . 
  believe it or not , there are eight different parties in the chinese parliament , excluding the ruling communist party . 
  they 're of course cpc puppets placed there just to keep appearances , but still ... 
  seems like they 're due for another one ... * grabs popcorn *, 
  this map is either partly incorrect or outdated . 
  greece , spain , czech republic and croatia allow dual citizenship in almost all cases . 
  obviously not !, 
  we should do anything in our power to crash their economy to the ground and make an example out of their traitorous insubordination . 
  no one leaves the eu and lives to say the tale ... ^ ^ / s, 
  it 's also interesting how the orange slides into silesia as well . 
  it 's sad to think how devastating the great famine has been to the irish populace . 
  even today , almost two centuries later , and it 's population [ has n't caught up ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/irelandrepublicpopulation1841.png ) to pre-famine numbers yet . 
   catalonia has never been a country neither has kosovo . 
  or palestine . 
  not if spain vetoes it . 
  which ( if independent catalonia happens ) it will . 
   1 corinthians 6:9 -- 10 romans 1:26 -- 28 i stand corrected . 
  someone correct me if i 'm wrong , but i think the only mention and condemnation of homosexuality in the bible is in the book of leviticus . 
  it says that no man may `` copulate '' with another man ( no mention of lesbians ) in the same passage it says that slaveholders may not whip their slaves too vigorously and that no two different kinds of seed may be planted in the same patch of land . 
  obviously not the entirety of the bible is followed to the letter even by the catholic church . 
  if they can do cherry-picking of verses , they might as well throw the whole thing off . 
  you mean * west * thrace , not east . 
  but you 're right . 
  those muslims were never expelled from greece and almost half of them are pomaks , not turks . 
  do you want me to remind you austria 's territorial changes during the same time-period ? 
  [ 1832 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/austrian_empire_%281815%29.svg ) -  [ 1947 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/locator_map_of_austria.svg/680px-locator_map_of_austria.svg.png ) and keep in mind that austria - as well as many other european states - was in a much more favourable position than greece was in the 19th century . 
  well , we went from 0km ^ 2 of independent greek territory to 131,957 km ^ 2 in a little over a century . 
  that 's not half bad .
