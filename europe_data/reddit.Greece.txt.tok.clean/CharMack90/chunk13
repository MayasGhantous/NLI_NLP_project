  it 's * australia * that has a good system dealing with immigrants . 
  we should try to do something closer to that ( minus the allegations for abuse and rape in immigrant centers , of course ) . 
  telling the truth = talking shit ? 
  i think taking away alcohol will only increase the suicides . 
  there will be no need to reinforce our borders if we deport illegal immigrants effectively and without delay . 
  they will quickly get the memo and stop trying to enter the eu . 
  it 's a big hassle for them to do it and most of them have to sell their belongings and go through dangerous situations to get here . 
  they wo n't do it without any incentive or prospect for a better life awaiting them . 
  i wan na hug lithuania and tell them everything will be alright . 
  they 're like russians , only whiter . 
  shhh ... let the people self-identify as anything they want and live the dream . 
  well , duh , that 's the point . 
  the more ridiculous they sound now , the less they will when they start proposing more plausible goals . 
  does n't this `` top czech negotiator '' know what haggling is ? 
  we ca n't even keep politics out of eurovision - a `` musical '' carnival of kitch - so what makes you think we can do that with the olympics ? 
  overeducation can also lead to that problem . 
  the merits of university level education are obvious , but no one with such a degree will choose a farmer 's job , even if they have the opportunity to do it . 
  that means people will either be unemployed or underemployed , since there ca n't be enough jobs for everyone outside the primary economic sector . 
  i was n't talking specifically about greeks . 
  it 's a general white thing that may or may not be present among white people . 
  i was talking for white people in general , not any specific country . 
  coming here , infesting our airports , flying over our airspace all willy-nilly ... 
  you 're right . 
  it does n't . 
  now if only we could convince our governments of that ... 
  `` white guilt '' is an actual thing . 
  some of us try to atone for centuries of racism by being wrongfully lenient towards non-whites . 
   i just do n't want them here , where they replace our culture . 
  because african cultures belong to africa and not to europe . 
  every nation should have it 's place that it owns and where it belongs . 
  i do n't disagree , but let 's not forget that , until not too long ago , africa was plagued by europeans and colonised from north to south . 
  and when those european colonisers left ( after squeezing dry as much african treasures as possible ) , the newly independent countries did n't even have a chance at equal footing to become as prosperous and stable as european countries would ( even though africa , in theory , should have reached europe in progress ) . 
  a big part why those people come over to europe is because europe came to them centuries ago and royally screwed them for decades without a trace of `` cultural respect '' in its mind . 
  petty change that wales is never gon na see , though . 
  the european commission funds , among other things , [ # 200m a year ] ( http://gov.wales/funding/eu-funds/?lang=en ) providing jobs and payments to some 16,000 farms in wales . 
  one of the main reasons this scheme exists is to keep wales ' countryside economically relevant and thousands of people safely employed . 
  yet 52.5 % of the voters decided to shoot themselves in the foot ( many without even knowing so ) . 
  now let 's see what kind of british government would ever take # 200m from any other sector ( s ) and give them to welsh farming . 
   [ ... ] he could n't tolerate to hear moliere 's language mistreated that way and thought that torturing cervantes ' one was better . 
  good one !, 
  xd on a similar note , both moliere and cervantes sounded * a lot * different than modern frenchmen and spaniards do . 
  i do n't think anyone listening to 17th century french or spanish would consider the speaker a native of their country . 
  i could never remember the appropriate ones . 
  you talk about `` doing something to change the dublin regulation '' as if it lies solely in greece 's hands to do something about it . 
  plus , members of the v4 group ( including slovakia ) have officially opposed any revision or expansion of the dublin regulation specifically because it 's more comfortable for them . 
  the current slovak prime minister has vetoed any mandatory quotas concerning refugees . 
  it 's like trying to talk to a wall . 
  not only slovakia , but most eu/efta/schengen countries seem to want to do whatever is best for them , while throwing solidarity out the window . 
  as long as they do n't have any substantial amount of migrants under their roof , they could n't care less what happens to them . 
  it seems to be a poetic/archaic form . 
  where does `` kavi '' come from , anyway ? 
  seems kinda random ... 
  it 's because of the [ indo-european s-mobile ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indo-european_s-mobile ) phenomenon , where the initial [ s - ] would drop before certain consonants . 
  wine is also called ** '' \u03bf\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 '' ** in greek , which also comes from the same indo-european root word as wine , vin , vino , etc. 
  you * do * realise that `` securing maritime borders '' means killing off migrants before they reach our shores , right ? 
  you * do * realise that the moment they enter greek waters ( which happens immediately , since there is no buffer zone between turkey and greece ) they are to be protected under eu laws , right ? 
  you * do * realise there is no way to send them back to turkey without it being considered a breach into turkish territory and a clear casus belli , right ? 
  you * do * realise greece is in the worst geographical place to receive and worst economical situation to sustain such great amounts of refugees/migrants , while not being involved in any way in the syrian war or inviting these people over , right ? 
  it 's easy to talk about `` safety of the borders '' when your country is situated in the centre of europe and does n't even have a sea bordering it . 
  it 's also easy to beat down the `` lazy '' poor guy and blame him for everything no matter how irrelevant it is to the refugee issue . 
  kudos for taking the easy route to this . 
   the slovak government has made a commitment to accept 100 refugees from the two eu countries in the mediterranean most burdened by the influx of refugees . 
  it is a voluntary commitment , since slovakia refused the compulsory relocation quotas . 
  slovakia is like that cheap guy who did n't pitch in for the neighbourhood bbq , but brought a six-pack of beer , so they think they 're cool . 
  that 's because half the times there 's an `` s '' in a word , portuguese people pronounce it as `` sh '' . 
  thish makesh them shound short of like rushiansh do . 
  no , azerbaijani [ \u0259 ] is pronounced like a fronted `` a '' as in c ** at ** or m ** a ** p. romanian [ \u0103 ] is a weak , centralised `` a '' , as in ** a ** meric ** a ** or ** a ** bove . 
  well , their language is n't related with any other existing language so they 're excused . 
  [ a ] is pronounced like `` a '' in f ** a ** ther . 
  ( ipa / a / ) [ \u0103 ] is pronounced like `` a '' in ** a ** bout . 
  [ `` many '' ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/6/63/number_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_seekers_in_the_eu_and_efta_member_states%2c_2014_and_2015_%28thousands_of_first_time_applicants%29_yb16.png ) might be an exaggeration . 
  those people knew exactly what they were doing . 
  two of the country 's most populated provinces are called [ north and south holland ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/map_provinces_netherlands-en.svg ) . 
  who the hell uses `` okay '' as a verb ? 
  that 's because romanian used to change the latin `` l '' and `` n '' into `` r '' between vowels and word-finally , ending up in words like : soa * r * e , fe * r * eastr\u0103 , ce * r * , etc. 
  i personally quite like that quirk . 
  it differentiates romanian from other romance languages . 
  latin `` cervisia '' still comes from a proto-celtic root word . 
  [ i was n't only ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/magna_graecia ) [ referring to sicily . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/byzantine_empire_under_the_justinian_dynasty ), 
  not really . 
  dozens of countries from all over the world [ sell some of their islands ] ( http://www.vladi-private-islands.de/en/islands-for-sale/price-list/ ) for profit . 
  greece is n't even among the top 20 when it comes to the number of islands on the market . 
   the kastelorizo island chain belonged to italy before it was annexed by greece in the 1940s . 
  they joined greece alongside the rest of the dodecanese . 
  they were n't even in italian hands by then . 
  the british occupied them after expelling the germans ( who took control of them during wwii when italy could n't ) and they allowed the islands to choose their own fate after the war . 
  the whole dodecanese chain joined the kingdom of greece freely in 1947 . 
  there was no military invasion from greece 's part ( which makes sense , since the vast majority of the population was greek to begin with ) . 
  you too . 
  reminds me of something we used to say when we thought the earth 's entire longitude was between the indus and gibraltar . 
  the one with the grandma is a killer !, 
   i `` love '' this one . 
  no matter what , women are always oppressed . 
  it 's similar to [ this old one ] ( https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2008/12/1.png ) and pretty poignant altogether . 
  no need . 
  the shock wave from the blast should do the trick . 
  how about eastern poland ? 
  it 'd be a nice little throwback if a dutch version of [ dejima island ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dejima ) was built in the ijsselmeer just to house japanese corporations and factories . 
  if anything , no one can best the dutch in creating artificial islands .
