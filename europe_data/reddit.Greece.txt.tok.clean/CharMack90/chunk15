  if an ancient macedonian saw this , they would think these are smoothed painted tree trunks . 
  ca n't they just go with something neutral like `` yugoslavic '' and be done with it ? 
  the language is so pluricentric that the various bosno-serbo-croatian dialects already pass through borders making a messy dialectal continuum . 
  it is pretty much impossible to know where `` serbian '' ends and `` croatian '' begins and vice versa . 
  just one of the 3 major dialects has so many subdialects that you end up with [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/shtokavian_subdialects1988_incl_slovenia.png/1280px-shtokavian_subdialects1988_incl_slovenia.png ) . 
  they 've been so fixed on keeping the argentinians away from the pacific that their animosity is spewing all over . 
  we 're rich in spirit !, 
  what are you talking about ? 
  their states are [ very different ] ( http://hitormiss.yolasite.com/resources/coloradovswyoming8.jpg ) from each other . 
  you keep your anschluss in your pants , jerry !, 
  yeah , like tzatziki/cac \u0131k , which we spend time fighting over , while it 's most likely we both took it from the armenians . 
  first , we need competent leadership to do any of those . 
  and greek governments since the metapolitefsi seem positively set on ruining this nation . 
  greece is greece 's worst enemy . 
  has been thus for a very long time . 
   well you kinda fucked up coming in with fake economic stats . 
  that 's a commonly repeated delusion and quite annoying , to be frank . 
  according to the greek financial audit of 2004 :  ... it was clearly stated that `` the impact of new accounting rules on the fiscal figures for the years 1997 to 1999 ranged from 0.7 to 1 percentage point of gdp ; this retroactive change of methodology was responsible for the revised deficit exceeding 3 % in 1999 , the year of emu membership qualification '' . 
  the above has led the greek minister of finance to clarify that the 1999 budget deficit was below the prescribed 3 % limit when calculated with the esa79 methodology in force at the time of greece 's application , and thus , since the remaining criteria had also been met , was properly accepted into the eurozone . 
  esa79 was also the methodology employed to calculate the deficits of all other eurozone members at the time of their applications . 
  that 's true . 
  i do n't think any muslim french citizen would ever pick up a stone and throw it on a non-covered woman . 
  that 's what the muslims in europe need to know : they can follow their religion in europe , but without the old-fashioned misanthropic ideas coming with it . 
  christianity was like that once , but it evolved and changed * a lot * since the middle ages . 
  if islam wants to thrive in europe , it needs to change as well . 
  it 's more like 100 years of pain or ??? 
  years of suffering . 
  and with every single greek government being an eu puppet so far , we need a miracle to be saved . 
  just look at the current clowns in power . 
  they gained their place by promoting a clear anti-austerity and eurosceptic viewpoint . 
  quickly afterwards , however , they agreed to the worst austerity measures , completely let the economy cripple , and became even bigger eu bitches than the previous govts . 
  we are really fucked . 
  there 's no party promoting anything close to economic assurance as of 2016 . 
  staying in the eu is fine , it 's the ez that was a mistake . 
  we should have never entered in the first place . 
  now , all we can do is dance to the beat they play for us . 
  leaving the ez would have been disastrous back in 2008 , let alone now . 
  tbf , putting some meat through a skewer and bbq/grilling it does n't really need a culinary genius to be developed . 
  gyro/kebap/shashlik variants have existed all over asia , europe , and even africa for god-knows-how-long . 
  there 's no way only one of them gave birth to the others . 
  a hijab is also a cultural wear , not a religious one , so it does n't fall under the `` freedom of religion '' law as many like to erroneously point out . 
  islam calls for both men and women to wear decent and modest clothing . 
  there 's nothing in the quran about covering your head/hair . 
  the way muslim societies interpret the `` modesty '' part is up to personal choice . 
  bj then . 
  or bojo . 
  either way , you can be quite creative with it . 
  looking at [ how empty canada is ] ( http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2006/as-sa/97-550/vignettes/img/map-2006-pop-density-canada-sz01-en.gif ) , anywhere on the black parts shall do . 
  why would they ? 
  give me a noteworthy example of a gender-specific social behaviour ( even one that is generalised ) that is n't because of social influence . 
  sure , certain aspects would be pushed into the gender because of biological reasons . 
  for example , women will still give birth , and their motherly instincts would largely help make them good parents . 
  but on a social level , a man and a woman are n't that different to begin with ( at least in more equal societies and cultures ) , so what would make them behave according to their gender if not their cultural upbringing ? 
  does the fact you have a penis or a vagina between your legs dictate your place in society and general behaviour ? 
  if you 're a man/woman in a small rural northern nigerian area , sure . 
  but , if you 're a man/woman in dowtown oslo or bergen , not so much , right ? 
  we 're halfway there already . 
  you obviously have no interest in understanding what the difference between sex and gender is , so i 'll stop trying to enlighten you . 
  not * become * man/woman , but * self-identify * as one or the other . 
  if we could have an anthropological experiment with a bunch of children born and raised in a closed environment and living without knowledge of what `` being a boy '' or `` being a girl '' is , then they most likely ( we ca n't be sure cause it has n't happened because of obvious ethical reasons ) would n't self-identify as one of the two . 
  they would notice their bodily differences , but would n't put them in genderly terms and `` behave like their gender '' . 
  picking a gender , living with it , following its norms , and entering the society with it is largely a social convention . 
  if we were n't raised as males/females from birth , we would n't be ascribing such categories to ourselves . 
  looks like germany is still segregated . 
  that 's what happens when you 're stuck on the wrong side of the iron curtain \u2122 . 
  you 'll get dragged easterly with the rest of the ex-socialists for eternity . 
  tough luck !, 
  well , the sex does n't change . 
  the gender does . 
  sex is biological . 
  you 're born with it and ca n't change it . 
  gender is a social construct . 
  it 's what you identify as and it does n't necessarily agree with your sex . 
  wrong branch of the family tree . 
  you 're probably thinking of spain 's habsburgs . 
  gypsies are actually spread [ all over europe ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/romani_population_average_estimate.png ) . 
  it 's just that eastern europe has more of them . 
  [ what are you talking about ? 
  if things keep going this way throughout the 21st century , young immigrants from [ sub-saharan africa ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/countriesbyfertilityrate.svg/863px-countriesbyfertilityrate.svg.png ) seem to be the key . 
  that 's a huge and sparsely populated country you have there . 
  it would be bad if someone were to ... * ( clasps hands menacingly ) * ... immigrate to it . 
  big guy turkey sat back and enjoyed the carnage for 5 years , while small guy ypg had thousands of brave men and women killed in action fighting back isil . 
  and the ypg is not the one `` stopping the turkish army '' . 
  turkey is the one who invaded and seizing the land the ypg held free . 
  turkey attacking the ypg and preventing their fighters from focusing on isil is what helps the is . 
  for now , turkey has only moved against kurdish rebels and the ypg . 
  whether they will actually prove useful against isil remains to be seen . 
  so , turkey is attacking the very group of fighters that has been the most effective in pushing back isil and you call that honesty ? 
  is the fact that turkey uses isil as leverage to invade a foreign country and attack its kurdish opposition something anyone would be proud of ? 
  `` oh yes , i 'm helping the region 's globally recognised terrorist group by moving against this opposing terrorist group ( recognised as such only by me ) that 's been fighting them for 5 years ... but i 'm honest about it , so it 's all cool ! '', 
  the nazis [ barely considered the jews humans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/untermensch ) , so the word ` racist ' describes them perfectly . 
  * europe ( an union ), 
  even if we wanted to , it 's not like they would let us do it . 
  if we had a currency of our own it 'd be easier , but with a currency shared with 18 other countries things get way more complicated . 
  the eurozone prefers to drag a sick horse behind it in hopes of exploitation and ( eventual ) recovery , rather than let it loose to do its own thing . 
  no , it does n't . 
  no muslim majority country has ever had a female imam . 
  the problem is that the majority of muslim countries will take denmark 's stance as an insult to islam . 
  allowing women to lead prayers as imams is unheard of in muslim countries and there might even be laws or religious rules against it . 
   she said that she is demonstrating how free women are in islam in the context of what culture , though ?
