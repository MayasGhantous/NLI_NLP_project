  we officially have foreign bankers calling the shots and ruling our country . 
  we 're anything but independent right now . 
  that 's why i said `` what americans made of it '' . 
  tex-mex and other americanised foreign cuisines and such . 
  they seem to be appreciating mexican cuisine ( or what americans made of it ) * a lot * , so there 's at least a part of mexico they care about . 
  the amount of russians in finland is negligible , while russians and belarusians in latvia constitute about 30 % of the country 's population . 
  / u/lamuks fear is more understandable . 
  i do n't think putin would dare attack an eu and/or nato member state . 
  he 's greedy and ambitious , but he 's not an idiot . 
  syriza is n't even close to far left . 
  it can barely be called ` left ' . 
  plus , golden dawn is the far right in greece , but there 's no far left party in the parliament ( though the communist party is pretty close ) . 
  thanks !, 
  i did n't know it had a name . 
  that 's true . 
  political ideology is a circle , not a straight line . 
  the further left you go , the closer to the right you get . 
  russia * is * combating western imperialism ... by promoting russian imperialism . 
  the laws of saudi arabia are much harsher than the ones of the uk . 
  freedom of speech is guaranteed in the uk , but not so much in sa . 
  dat russia-turkey-iran triple alliance is too sweet . 
  britain wants some of dat honey , too . 
  it certainly gives a `` dystopian totalitarian regime '' vibe to me . 
  * sanctions for everyone !, 
  by all-time standards , actually . 
  journalism was never an honest , objective approach to news and information . 
  that 's what it 's * supposed to be * , but it never was . 
  there 's always been certain cases of decent journalists out there , but they were n't representatives of a specific period in time . 
  the eu will implode a million times before the states agree to go federal . 
  sure , it was all churchill 's doing . 
  it 's not like the greeks had a [ three-and-a-half year long civil war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_civil_war ) to crush any talk about communism or anything . 
  also , stalin firmly wanted the war to end . 
  it was tito backing it up . 
   they do n't want to go to some countries . 
  well , obviously those are not refugees , since refugees do n't get to choose like an immigrant would . 
  all that should matter to them is safety and proper appliance of human rights . 
  asking them where they would like to go is not `` being civil '' or `` abiding by the rules '' . 
  it 's plainly stupid . 
  a failure in the script , like you said . 
  tectonic plates do n't define a continent in the geostrategical sense . 
  if they were , then cuba and northern japan would be [ part of the same continent ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/plates_tect2_en.svg/1280px-plates_tect2_en.svg.png ) . 
  no , the weapons belong to the us . 
  it 's nato 's `` nuclear sharing '' policy that keeps them in bases in turkey , germany , the netherlands , belgium , and italy . 
  this may come as a shock to you , but belgium is not a balkan country . 
  it also echoes the [ september events ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/istanbul_pogrom ) of 1955 , when a turkish usher of the consulate in thessaloniki planted a bomb in the house of mustafa kemal . 
  the man was captured and confessed right away , but the turkish media were silent about the perpetrator insinuating that the greek government/people were behind this . 
  it was later all but confirmed that the british were behind this . 
  a violent organised mob of turks almost immediately gathered in istanbul and started smashing shops , houses , and property belonging mostly to greeks ( as well as many armenians and other minorities ) , burning down buildings , and even lynching people in the streets . 
  the city 's police could n't ( or did n't bother to ) control the situation and a martian law had to be implemented to allow the army to stop the frantic crowd . 
  the city 's greek population ( already in decline for years due to turkish anti-minority laws and the [ varl\u0131k vergisi tax ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/varl%c4%b1k_vergisi ) , would end up being forced to leave the city our people have been living in since emperor constantine established it [ ( or rather , since it was colonised by the megarians in 657 bc ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/byzantium ) . 
  the point is that the turkish people have been swayed by their government and authority figures as easily as the wind sways the grass . 
  this is something they largely share with the russians , whereas in most of the western nations , the people are very judgemental and not quick to trust their governments . 
  bulgaromanian union ? 
  no one ? 
  okay , i 'll just leave this here just in case . 
  i would call the english language a creole of romance-germanic vocabulary on a germanic grammar with [ several celtic influences ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brittonicisms_in_english ) . 
  quite a mongrel , but it 's expected considering its history . 
   williams great granddaughter ( x22 ) is sitting on the british throne , that bastards ( quite literally a bastard ) line is hard to shake . 
  actually , lizzie v. 2 is n't any more related to william the bastard than any other brit . 
  she 's not even directly related to lizzie v. 1 or her head-chopping whore of a father . 
  if you use william 's line as a means to justify getting the english throne , then it is up for grabs for anyone . 
  go plant your buttcheeks on it yourself before someone else beats you to it !, 
  i love it when people speak english in their native , non-anglophonic accent . 
  it adds more flavour to their speech and it 's perfectly natural anyway . 
  i also think that , maybe due to its extensive reach , english is one of the few languages where a foreign accent does n't `` ruin '' it , but it blends well with it . 
  a `` byzantine system '' is a system that is/seems extremely complicated , bureaucratic , and hard to follow . 
  it 's funny cause , lexically speaking , english is [ more french than it is english ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/origins_of_english_piechart.svg/677px-origins_of_english_piechart.svg.png ) . 
  the normans did quite a number on the vocabulary . 
  are n't \u00c5landers against it too ? 
  is finnish even mandatory there ? 
   signal market this may actually be the future of economics . 
  i 'm sorry , but if you have your capital city 's mayor blame the works of an alleged coup-leader on the existence of genies , then you really need to start re-evaluating your political leaders . 
  they do n't even have to . 
  trump is in free fall . 
  he 's a blabbering idiot who has managed to vomit countless of nonsensical statements , insult every minority under the sun , and push away every sane person who would consider voting for him . 
  bravo to basile and congratulations to italy !, 
  that 's true . 
  and they are obligated by law to rescue them . 
  something that the refugees and their smugglers know very well and they take advantage of it by purposedly sinking their boats . 
  basically , when the refugees are in turkish ( non-eu ) waters the eu navy has no power over them and once they cross to greek ( eu ) waters the eu navy is required to rescue and pass them on to registration offices and shelters . 
  it 's eu law . 
  it 's hard to find a way around it without breaking humanitarian laws and being openly violent . 
  good one . 
  the pot calling the kettle black . 
  that 's true , but no russian naval commander would launch a ship from the baltic sea or the pacific ocean to get it to the eastern mediterranean . 
  the black sea fleet bases in sevastopol and novorossiysk are the most important ones russia has . 
   once trump wins yeah ... not happening . 
  the [ press freedom in turkey ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/press_freedom_index#/media/file:rwb-pressfreedomindex-worldmap.svg ) fares far worse than in eu states , on par with countries like russia , venezuela , and congo . 
  they are not exactly the most impartial and trustworthy . 
  this is n't tumblr , people !, 
   we are opposed to arming terrorists . 
  [ are you sure about that ? 
  ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-turkey-arms-iduskbn0o61l220150521 ) and what about all the cases of violence against kurds , both in turkey ( historically ) and syria ( the last few years ) and the decades of human rights violations , oppression , and ethnic cleansing against them ? 
  are you planning to cite examples for that as well , or are you going to leave your comment half-true ? 
  all kurdish forces , even the ones taking arms to defend their own lands , are considered a terrorist organisation by the turkish government . 
   not now , not when erdogan is president if you think erdo\u011fan is going anywhere anytime soon , my fellow neighbour , you clearly have n't been paying much attention . 
  or does anyone seriously think that he wasted over $ 600 million of the nation 's resources to built himself a presidential palace just to pass it on to the next guy ? 
  turkey is a free country . 
  the eu has no power over turkey 's political and economic alliances ( and neither should it be able to ) . 
  if they wish to ally with russia and give up on the eu for good , they are free to do so .
