  even if that was the case , erdogan could have helped his country achieve those goals to be ready to access the eu . 
  if the eu was still denying turkey entry , * then * he could bitch about it and have a valid reason to do so as well . 
  no , he 'll gather only a certain amount of these people and spend the next day denying he claimed 100,000 would follow him . 
   ... aiming to raise 50 billion euros . 
  o_o they 're gon na buy the whole continent , are n't they ? 
   what can turkey , which has been kept waiting at the door of the european union for 53 years , expect from the west ? 
  well , if turkey went along with the [ eu acquis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/acquis_communautaire ) that all current eu members had to go through to be accepted into the union , then they would n't be `` waiting at the door '' for so long . 
  i would n't call russia `` loved '' by us . 
  we just do n't hate it like most of europe does . 
  he 's certainly not as talked over as bush or clinton were , so i guess this is a good thing . 
   not really that `` new '' though , they have been in power since 2012 has n't your government been ruling china since 1949 ? 
  close enough . 
   plus , many european languages have names for the city starting with * [ b - ] * . 
  for example , breslau ( german ) , boroszl\u00f3 ( hungarian ) , breslavia ( italian , spanish ) , et al. 
  makes sense , since wroc\u0142aw 's latin name ( in some old documents ) is * bratislavia * . 
  i feel like it should also include average climate and weather conditions . 
  it 's definitely an important factor when it comes to choosing where to live . 
  a ghost !, 
  catalan modernisme is such a funky and unique architectural style . 
  i love it !, 
  i do n't know . 
  i did n't expect tallinn to be placed above toronto for me , but it did . 
  not exactly the same . 
  putin already had the majority of the people 's support when he started turning his country into a pseudo-democratic authoritarian state . 
  he also did it with lots of political support , slowly over many years . 
  even today , it 's hard to say when the tipping point was . 
  erdogan , on the other hand , is hasty and sloppy . 
  he has only about half of turkey on his side . 
  his autocratic shift happened too quickly ( he went from mild to extra spicy in just 4 months ! ), 
  and his support from the political spectrum is still on the fence . 
  if this keeps going on , turkey 's instability could fully fend it off its allies and throw it into large social unrest and even civil war in the near future . 
  and modern china . 
  there are 9 legally recognised political parties in the prc , but only the communist party governs the whole country . 
  my 12th match is the first one outside europe . 
  oh , yes they did ... * the independent newspaper article from 1993 : * http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/52a1c37869bedd476f5aaefd-960/independent-1993%20 ( 1 ) -1 . jpeg, 
  a tad oversimplified , but prety good all-over . 
  yeah , books ... sure . 
  and a hotter accent ( standard dublin accent , at least ) . 
  then i 'd go with * breslavia * . 
  that 's how italians , spaniards , and portuguese call it and it rolls off the tongue nicely in english . 
  family guy [ ruined ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vryp3pa-pyu&amp;t=0m07s ) my perception of this piece . 
  or we could go with irish english and give england a double middle finger . 
  i 'd love to visit troms\u00f8 during aurora borealis season . 
  the city looks very picturesque and clean , and it 's close to many natural parks and beautiful fjords . 
  i also understand that the climate is milder ( due to the gulf stream ) than it is in other areas of similar latitude , which is a plus . 
  true . 
  i 've barely ever seen anyone with a blazer , let alone a white one . 
  you can refuse no matter the case as long as you present a justifiable reason . 
  the swiss are rich , happy and their tax system works very well . 
  the greeks have a bad economy , are unhappy , * and * the tax system works like shit . 
  your point ? 
  i never said i want her to cut the deal . 
  i 'm only saying the reason she did it . 
  not to spare greece ( she does n't give a fuck about us ) , but to save her career . 
  what makes you think it 's low quality ? 
  are you insinuating germans have more potency than immigrants ? 
  if anything , statistics show us quite the opposite . 
  immigrant stallions in dire need of 100 $ , i 'd assume . 
  `` well you have been replaced . 
  i do n't need anyone now . 
  when i delete you maybe i 'll stop feeling so ~ ~ bad ~ ~ . '', 
  hopefully not many turkish citizens are as defeatist as you . 
  * `` he 's a son of a bitch , but at least he 'll keep most of these refugees from coming to germany long enough for me to clear up my public image until the next elections . 
  '' * that 's what she thought . 
  i agree . 
  we should have never been allowed into the ez , but the eu was willing to bend the rules ( allowing us a 3.1 % deficit during entry instead of  3 % ) to let us in . 
  they did that knowing full well of the implication , so both sides need to be blamed for this . 
  after the fall of the socialist states , the west/east sociopolitical divide started moving further east . 
  starting from the [ 2004 enlargement of the eu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_enlargement_of_the_european_union ) this became clearly defined . 
  the [ un definition ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/europe_subregion_map_un_geoscheme.svg/680px-europe_subregion_map_un_geoscheme.svg.png ) looks pretty apt to me . 
  i love how the thumbnail depicts him crowned with a halo of eurostars ... 
  most of you who bothered to vote . 
  the ones who did n't vote decided to leave the outcome to the rest , so they do n't get to complain . 
  some of us do n't want to see you leave either , but most of you decided against remaining , so now we all have to live with the consequences . 
  only google search can claim the title of `` greatest front page of the internet '' . 
  it 's still assumed . 
  the main reason turkey believes it was g\u00fclen who was responsible for this is erdo\u011fan saying so . 
  most likely not . 
  there are a couple of things that may give them away , but they 're not that prevalent . 
  it 's not real recovery . 
  most of that 4 % down from 2013 comes from [ underpaid part-time jobs ] ( http://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2015/10/14/part-time-rules-in-greek-labor-market-half-a-million-employees-have-to-live-on-less-than-e400-per-month/ ) . 
  you mean griko ? 
  yes , it 's a nice little gem in the area . 
  it sounds like a mixture of greek and italian in accent , but it 's pretty much standard greek heavy on the italian vocab . 
  sadly , it 's declining fast and it 's mostly found in local songs nowadays . 
  probably not when it comes to accent , but definitely among the top 3 when it comes to native languages and dialects . 
  accents ? 
  not really . 
  it 's almost exclusively among older generations and people living in remote rural areas that may have sort of different way of speech . 
  cretans , rhodians and people from the ionian islands traditionally have a more musical way of speech , but the first one is declining and the other two are almost fully gone . 
  pretty much all greeks from all over the country understand each other , unless they get to use their local dialect ( not the same as ` accent ' ) in which case it becomes harder . 
  seriously , though . 
  i think italy is the most linguistically diverse country in all of europe . 
  that 's true . 
  it 's usually easier for italians to understand written french and spoken spanish than the other way round . 
  he chose an odd time to do it considering what / u/rorschachsqt said . 
  it 's like he 's telling other islamic countries to move forward to reach turkey 's progress while he 's making his country move backwards and lose big parts of this progress . 
  maybe he 's trying to meet them halfway . 
  `` leader of country , whose systemic oppressive tactics against minorities has resulted in the creation and empowerment of a handful of terrorist organisations both inside and outside said country , calls the kettle black . '', 
  it was a nice middle finger to the eu .
