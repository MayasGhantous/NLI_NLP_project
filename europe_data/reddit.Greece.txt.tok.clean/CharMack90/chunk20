  because israel is the greatest american ally in the middle east and its relationship with iran is at best problematic , with iran attempting to get into the nuclear weapons deal and israel fearing it might lose its military power on the area . 
  that 's why a very strong anti-iranian feeling has been cultivated since the late '70s ( when the pahlavi dynasty was overthrown and ayatollah khomeini took charge of iran ) , making many americans feel like iran is an actual threat . 
  we 're more likely to send a man to jupiter than achieve such a deal in our lifetime . 
  so , biassed it is . 
  that was my point . 
  the nobel prizes will collect submissions for science and literature from all over the world , but their choice for laureates will always tilt towards europe and especially sweden . 
  sweden has also received more nobel prizes in literature than the whole of asia . 
  am i to believe that swedish literature is more lofty than its massively divergent , multi-century developing , highly critically acclaimed asian counterpart ? 
  well , they represent a nation of up to 22 million people ( in turkey alone ) that has systematically been oppressed , denied civil & cultural rights , and even downright massacred by the turkish republic 's government since the country 's establishment . 
  i oppose terrorism in all its forms and certainly do n't believe spilling blood is in any way justified , but you have to admit that many of pkk 's worst actions are at least expected as a reaction to turkey 's iron stance against the kurds . 
  you ca n't kill the tiger 's cubs and be surprised when she bites your neck . 
  sweden ( pop . 
  ~ 10 million ) has received more nobel prizes than all of asia ( pop ~ 4.4 billion ) . 
  the committee is definitely biassed . 
  i mean , it 's only half an hour by car from r\u00f8nne to nex\u00f8 . 
  you can even use a bicycle for such a short distance . 
  i think it 's closer to ` brainwashing ' and ` having-your-cerebral-functions-twisted-enough-to-think-beheading-anyone-you-oppose-is-okay ' , than actual mental illness . 
  it 's a sociopsychological issue . 
  i feel like a new scientific term is needed . 
  getting taller seems to be the most effective way to keep your head above water level . 
  japan , though , is still technically at war with russia . 
  they never signed a peace treaty after wwii because of the kurils dispute , so the two countries are at a 70-year-old stalemate . 
  australia takes immigrants , not refugees . 
  any person arriving illegally in australian waters claiming to be a refugee is sent to refugee camps in manus island and niue waiting for their refugee claim to be processed . 
  if they 're found to not be genuine refugees they are repatriated or sent to another safe country outside australia . 
  if they 're genuine , they are resettled in papua new guinea . 
  basically , australia will only take you in if you can prove you moved to the country to work , provide for yourself , and pay taxes while expecting no benefit from the state . 
  it 's been as such since 2013 . 
  still better than the massive plague outbreak of the 14th century , so ... yeah . 
  that 's sort of a plus ... kinda . 
  yes , unlike previous pontiffs , the current pope is suprisingly cordial and tolerant . 
  how unchristian of him !, 
  you spelled ` horse meat ' wrong . 
  `` turkish justice minister bekir bozdag said anyone who suggests the attempted coup was staged was probably involved in it themselves and would face investigation . '', 
  * facepalm * edit : apparently , an ` appeal to probability ' fallacy and a 5th-grader 's `` he who smelt it , dealt it '' rhetoric is enough to legally persecute someone in modern day turkey . 
  in other news , rain is still wet . 
  are n't arrest warrants supposed to be issued by judges ? 
  were there any judges allowed to keep their office after the purge ? 
   president tayyip erdogan [ ... ] saying it would enable the authorities to act more efficiently to bring those r\u0336e\u0336s\u0336p\u0336o\u0336n\u0336s\u0336i\u0336b\u0336l\u0336e\u0336 opposing him to `` justice '' . 
  sounds about right . 
  in the us , proper id is n't even obligatory for a citizen . 
  lots of americans throw a fit because they are asked to bring an identification document with them when voting . 
  crazy stuff !, 
  he also does n't have a strong footing in `` protecting '' turkish people outside turkey and use that as an excuse the same way putin did with crimea . 
  putin , though , had a semi-logical reason to do it . 
  crimea 's population is over 2/3 ethnically russian . 
  erdogan does n't have such an advantage to recreate his empire . 
  ethnic turks do n't constitute the majority on any country outside turkey ; not even a respectable minority . 
  the closest they have is a < 20 % of the population of cyprus , almost all of which is located in the northern self-declared independent part of the island . 
  any attempt at an expansionist war will be seen globally as clearly offensive and without excuse . 
  so ... half of turkey then ? 
  that was an american affair , not a european one . 
   that 's what you get for calling us finish instead of ~ ~ finnish ~ ~ suomaperkelainen  ftfy :p, 
  / \u029de\u027e.ma . 
  ` nia / to anyone who can read ipa . 
  or denmark , which was allowed an opt-out . 
  same in russian and belarusian . 
  9 days too late , but i wo n't complain . 
  it could also be because of the latin word for abduction or kidnapping ( ` raptio ' ) being erroneously translated to `` rape '' in english . 
  just look at * the rape of europa * ( sp . 
  * el rapto de europa * ) [ by goya ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europa_\\ ( mythology \\ ) # / media/file : the_rape_of_europa , _ goya.jpg ) . 
  ` rapto ' is spanish for abduction . 
  same thing with the [ rape of the sabine women ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_rape_of_the_sabine_women ) . 
   apollo is much more dignified and deserving to be the chief god . 
  [ daphne ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/daphne ) would beg to differ . 
   well except the part where two of them are being investigated for fraud ... 
  i consider this a good thing . 
  not the fraud , but that there 's investigation about it . 
  the sign may be too simplistic ( it 's a rally sign , not a thesis ) , but it does have a point . 
  the eu/eec has greatly contributed to the lack of hostilities between its members by bringing economic integration to the forefront and trying to make wars between them obsolete . 
  it was the main reason for its creation and it has succeeded in it so far , bringing us the most peaceful era this continent as a whole has ever experienced . 
  neither country has ever been a member of the eu or eec before it . 
  you mean mike ` short for michael pencil ' pence ? 
  yeah , it 's better ( and cheaper ) to just take the cable car lift . 
  that being said , though , this does n't mean terrorist acts should be trivialized . 
  we should seriously fight against terrorism , but we should also not allow it to consume us ( although this is a fight we 're currently losing ) and give way for government agencies to use it as a weapon against our rights , like the patriot act did . 
  i agree with the first part of your sentence . 
  here 's half an upvote for you !, 
  dude , these people measure their weight in * stones * !, 
  they 're clearly savages !, 
   moreover , it is written that : `` you , who with the ` sweat ' of your hands , ** have contributed to the progress that turkey has achieved ** , can participate in the future of our country . '', 
  by migrating to another country ? 
  what is he on about ? 
   time for an european company to step in !, 
  euber to the rescue !, 
  i 'm not saying that we 're right next door and our beaches are better ... but we 're right next door and our beaches are better . 
  i assume that once ~ ~ federalisation ~ ~ greater european integration ensues , the 25th of march ( signature of the treaty of rome ) might become an eu-wide transnational holiday . 
  i 'm personally a bit against it , since that day is already a [ national holiday in my country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_war_of_independence ) , but we could take one for the team , i guess . 
  there 's always [ this one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europe_day ) , though . 
  how much would you say his anti-eu rhetoric affects public opinion ? 
  is the average hungarian citizen pro- or anti-eu ? 
  we all know it was einar ... 
  not only that , but the doctor ( s ) who validated the request and operated the procedure could get themselves in serious legal trouble if it turns out the patient was mentally unstable when they chose to be euthanized . 
  i agree , but i 'd add medical consent after physical and psychological evaluation . 
  it actually owned only a `` tiny '' part of that `` tiny '' outpost . 
  not to mention the whole libya debacle , where france was a leading force . 
  it 's almost as if france is a sovereign nation that chooses whether or not to support a war against another country depending on the estimated benefits it 'll gain from the action/inaction . 
  it technically could be used as casus belli in real life as well , but it should n't and it obviously wo n't . 
  then we 'll be deporting them for being immigrants , not because of the domestic abuse . 
  we ca n't confuse different issues .
