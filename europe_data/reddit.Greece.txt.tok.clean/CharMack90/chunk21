  do n't forget that hitler lost a war , while stalin won it . 
  so , you want even fewer people to consider having children . 
  `` awaken thee , romanian !,

   after five years of legally residing in another eu country , you can apply for permanent residency . 
  does this apply to all member-states ? 
   is it true that people leave ( parts of ) their houses unfinished/under construction on purpose since there is no property tax on a building-in-progress ? 
  i 'm not familiar with this , but i would n't be surprised if it 's true . 
   the amount of unfinished buildings i saw on my last holiday in greece was staggering , but was n't sure if that was due to recession or other reasons . 
  there are a number of unfinished buildings in my neighbourhood ( i can see one from my balcony ) , but recession would be the primary reason for that . 
  no people live in these buildings , that 's for sure . 
   prickly pears ( \u03c6\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03c5\u03ba\u03b9\u03ad\u03c2 ) are a ind of cactus , are n't they ? 
  yes , they apparently are . 
  you see sad , but i see classy ( by casino standards ) . 
  well , considering cactuses are n't native to the old world , they would be invaside species and could end up harming the natural landscape . 
  plus , i 've never really heard of an area being `` greened up '' by * cactuses * . 
  our islands have the advantage of a low population ( no need for large multi-apartment buldings ) and the need for a picturesque architectural look which contributes to the tourism industry . 
  architectural beauty is a source of income to the islands . 
  the vast majority of the mainland , sadly , does n't have the same advantage . 
  semi-barren , mountainous terrain without any considerable vegetation is the natural landscape of almost all small [ south aegean islands ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/notio_egeo_in_greece.svg/1003px-notio_egeo_in_greece.svg.png ) . 
  it does n't rain much for large trees to grow and sunlight is too harsh during the summer months , so plants tend to be more yellow-ish than green . 
  it may look bleak , but it 's a natural landscape . 
  rhodes to the immediate south is larger and more humid , so it supports several forested areas [ like this one ] ( http://viagallica.com/grece/img/vallon_papillons_020_ ( 2009-04-23 \\ ) . jpg ) . 
  it could be nice , but things like city-wide clay roofs and colour pallets could come out a little gimmicky . 
  building heights are already set by urban planning laws in many cities and towns around the country . 
  what 's more important is to maintain our historic buildings and not let them go to waste and/or be destroyed . 
  more like 50 % and this includes both cities ' larger metropolitan areas , but yes , your concrete jungle point still stands .

  how hard can it be to lift a veil ? 
  well , considering the fact that it 's extremely unlikely ( verging on impossible ) for a niqab-wearing woman to be present at a sports event , i 'd say any such person spotted there is almost certainly a hooligan . 
  do n't forget roussillon . 
  spain scores at no. 17 in the * democracy index * and no. 36 in the * human freedom index * , so it 's still one of the most free and democratic countries one could live in . 
  it 's not perfect , but it 's much better than the world average . 
  oh yes , because it 's so hard to spot a person wearing a niqab in a stadium . 
   on sunday , the former tory leader michael howard , citing margaret thatcher 's war with argentina over the falkland islands , said he was `` absolutely certain that our current prime minister will show the same resolve in standing by the people of gibraltar . '' sure , if spain invades and occupies gibraltar then britain should answer accordingly . 
  till then , the comparison is both insulting ( argentina was under a military dictatorship at the time , while spain is a free democratic state ) and stretched to make a belligerent political point that neither government supports .

  young greeks are often very opinionated about all sort of subjects . 
  reddit collects users from all parts of the world , adhering to all different opinions and ideas . 
  greek redditors are n't exempt from that . 
  it 's more complicated than that , actually . 
  some greeks hate turkey ; some love it . 
  most , though , do n't really care much about it as long as there 's peace among the two nations . 
   have some work experience - have a degree that 's a problem for the country who the migrant left , though . 
  if you contribute to the brain drain of developing countries , then they 'd never be developed enough to cut back their negative migration rate .

  there 's no such thing as a `` silent letter '' in greek . 
  if you write it , you pronounce it . 
  you have no problem with them being in the middle or end of words ; just the beginning . 
  i assume that 's why in other words of greek origin like psychology , pterodactyl , pneumonia , etc the initial `` p '' is silent . 
  it 's hard to pronounce it for ( most ) native english-speakers . 
  better join back fast before scarjo nackts you . 
  it 's weird to think that these two nations were part of the same country once . 
  it 's funny to listen to english-speakers trying to pronounce '' \u039e '' * / ks / * and '' \u03a8 '' * / ps / * . 
  they tend to place a short vowel sound between the two phonemes because they ca n't say them otherwise . 
  i was referring to the fact that there 's still a very evident substratum of shame ( because of the results of third reich patriotism ) in modern german society . 
  there 's no such thing in greece . 
  to be fair , patriotism in germany has been historically more ... ahem ... * unhealthy * than it has in greece .

  who the hell would go there for summer holidays ? 
  it 's hundreds of kilometers away from the sea , on one of the least developed parts of the country . 
  a german or a dutch tourist would n't even end up there by accident .

  this ^ you 'll be helping us fight corruption this way , and we need that more than anything . 
   i would think we should be more open to guns now with the way things have gone . 
  * fuck * no !, 
  lax gun laws only result in more of the wrong people getting armed , which leads to more gun related accidents than `` protecting ourselves '' . 
  if anything , we need stricter gun laws when criminal activity increases . 
  the moment we decide to turn people into citizen militia and make them defend themselves is the moment we give up on our law enforcement and risk allowing crime to skyrocket . 
  more guns and lax gun laws = / = more safety . 
  it 's quite the opposite . 
  so what ? 
  the usa 's oath of office ends with `` so help me god '' . 
  does this mean the us is not a secular country ? 
  a country is considered secular if a specific religion is n't given official power and/or implemented in the country 's laws , of which neither orthodoxy nor any other religion holds in the hellenic republic . 
  there 's a clear separation of state and church is greece . 
  the fact that most of the populace adheres to a specific faith does n't change that . 
  greece is a secular country according to the constitution , but greek orthodoxy is acknowledged as the traditional ( but not official ) religion of greece for historic and cultural purposes . 
  that being said , mount athos is an autonomous territory . 
  greek laws do n't apply to them and it 's basically a rock with a bunch of monasteries on it . 
  it 's common for monasteries to not allow entrance to people of a specific gender ( all over christianity ) , but mount athos applies this to the entire land of its monasteries . 
  i believe they 're considered the likeliest to be admitted to the eu out of all other candidates as of 2017 .
