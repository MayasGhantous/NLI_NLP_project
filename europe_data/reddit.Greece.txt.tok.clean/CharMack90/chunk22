  lighten up , sweethearts !, 
  yes , you 're right . 
  plus , contrary to popular belief ( of which i admit i 've once fallen victim myself ) the uk has only `` blocked '' a handful of eu laws ; only 2 % of them since 1999 . 
  it has been an integral part of the eu and a far greater boon than a bane to it . 
  watching the uk leave should only make the rest of us feel sad . 
  no feeling of anger or relief is factually justified .

  okay , i see how you pass from one side of the lagoon to the other , but how do you get to the outer sea from there ? 
  i even checked [ google maps ] ( https://www.google.gr/maps/@48.6436968,-2.0223572,3a,75y,236.9h,58.12t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1swobdyjf2lsz98nutqxjqja!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) and there are bridges that seem too low for any boat to pass under . 
  unless they are moveable bridges , but they do n't seem like they are . 
  am i missing something ? 
  tbh , it sounds like a good job for someone who likes nature and working alone . 
  how do the boats in the inner lagoon get to the outer sea ? 
  there is n't any visible waterway . 
  well , for starters , your borders were hermetically shut until the 1990s , so there were very few albanians in greece before then . 
  when the borders opened , albanian immigrants came to greece in massive hordes ( most of them illegally ) and neither the state nor the people saw that as a positive thing . 
  in seemingly overnight , albanians became the largest minority in greece , a country that was n't even used to having a minority ( we still have a problem with that ) . 
  that being said , albanians nowadays are very well integrated and xenophobic remarks against them are more uncommon and frowned upon . 
  [ kurds in turkey ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurds_in_turkey )  in an attempt to deny their existence , the turkish government categorized kurds as `` mountain turks '' until 1991 , and the words `` kurds '' , `` kurdistan '' , or `` kurdish '' were officially banned by the turkish government . 
  or will get down there to keep them company . 
   * taoiseach * ; tawa-seetch i like how you read the first part in french and the second one in english . 
  yes , i agree with that . 
  nevertheless , the european countries that erdogan blames for being `` undemocratic '' are much better at respecting human rights than turkey ever was ( especially under his rule ) . 
  i 'm afraid if the result is a no , he might lash out even harder than before . 
  nah , i personally worry way more about putin 's alliance over trump 's . 
  the kurds would 've been appeased and democracy would n't be breached if they were allowed an autonomous region with its own rule of law inside turkey , [ the way iraq did ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iraqi_kurdistan ) . 
  the turkish government , though , until recently did n't even recognize kurds as a different ethnic group , used to refer to them as `` mountain turks '' and suppress them using everything under the sun . 
  i do n't condone terrorism and i believe there 's no excuse for it , but do n't forget that pkk 's formation and activities are a direct reaction to turkey 's actions towards the kurdish people , albeit a violent one . 
  i know this is how most irish speakers pronounce it nowadays ; i just let you know that this is not how it was pronounced in the ( near ) past or how it 's still pronounced by many older speakers of the language . 
  english influenced irish a lot and the pronunciation of / r / is probably the most prevalent sound change in modern irish gaelic . 
  edit : check [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/r#other_languages ) out to see the difference between `` proper '' irish / r / ( alveolar tap ) vs english / r / ( alveolar approximant ) . 
  that 's because of english influence . 
  irish / r / was originally pronounced like [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:alveolar_tap.ogg ) , before english influence pushed its pronunciation more towards [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:postalveolar_approximant.ogg ) . 
  `` p\u00f3g mo th\u00f3in '' is probably my favourite irish phrase . 
  i wish they 'd at least try not to pronounce / r / the english way . 
  it sounds really weird . 
  yeah , i went with the 2016 ranking . 
  things have changed a bit , apparently . 
  can you link to something that does n't auto-download , please ? 
  maybe they 're moving to actual holland inside the netherlands . 
  i can confirm that it 's not even remotely true . 
  i do n't know where this notion came from , but it 's invalid . 
  the cost of registering a newborn born from a married * or * an unmarried mother is about 5 $ , but - if you do n't do it in the first 10 days after birth - you get a fine of about 100 $ , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  marriage has nothing to do with it . 
  i personally know of many young couples who got married * after * having a baby ( usually doing the wedding and the christening at the same day - two birds with one stone kinda thing ) and none of them could really spare 2-3 ,000 $ or any other crazy amount like this one . 
  low birth rate is a result of many young couples not affording to have 2.1 children nowadays . 
  retirement at 65 , euthanasia at 70 . 
  considering it makes russia look bigger , i 'm disappointed op did n't use it to further their point . 
  yeah , it 's better to call it an old * nation * instead of an old country , but people mix those two up all the time . 
  people keep repeating this , but the fact that a nation did n't have its own independent country for a while does n't necessarily mean it lost its connection to its ancestral roots . 
  a number of different factors can maintain this connection ( like culture , traditions & customs , education , religion , etc ) even without the protection of set borders and a continuous government . 
  he 's also the second richest man in the world .

  i see your liechtenstein and i raise you a san marino ( 301-2017 ) . 
  the main reason the ottoman empire is hated ( in europe ) nowadays is because it haulted progress among its subjects . 
  while most of europe lived through the political , economic , scientific , and artistic progress of the renaissance and the enlightenment , the ottoman empire would stagnate and keep the rest of its holdings several steps behind . 
  for the entirety of its existence , even though it lasted for over 6 centuries , the ottoman empire contributed next to nothing to humanity . 
  most other empires would leave their mark in this world , but the ottomans came , conquered , and were driven out without leaving anything good behind . 
  living in greece , i can see how obvious this is in the island of corfu that was under venetian rule and was never conquered by the ottomans . 
  corfu today has one of the most beautiful architectural and cultural footprints in all of greece . 
  it has a historic art scene ( specifically in music ) and it had the first academic institution established in greece giving birth to many renowned scientists and artists .
