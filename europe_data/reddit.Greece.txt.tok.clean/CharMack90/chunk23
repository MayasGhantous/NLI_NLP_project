  the ottomans could have been a better empire if they valued their place in the world more . 
  do n't take their word as a representation of an entire country 's educational system . 
  the ottoman empire was a shitty empire , but there have been far shittier ones . 
  everything the ottomans touch turns to shit . 
  got it !, 
  every time i see these kinds of maps , i 'm only reminded of how horrible the people were at marking things on a map back then . 
  ni leaving the uk to ( re ) join the republic has been a possibility since the good friday agreement , if not before that . 
  brexit has only made that even more likely to happen in the future ( but definitely not certain ) . 
  the examples you mentioned are just reaching and have nothing to do with the current political climate in any of these countries . 
  what shanty is this ? 
  teach us , pls . 
  well , we 're all ignorant of the uk 's future , so no one can be sure of anything . 
   i 'm just here for the ~ ~ comments ~ ~ circlejerk and the banter . 
  just say it like it is . 
  can we get a guide to `` kamel\u00e5s\u00e5 '' ? 
  that 's asshole would-be * sultan * for you . 
  * mutti * is dead . 
  long live * vati * . 
  well , one of the like ... four different empires where `` the sun never sets '' , to be precise . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/louisiana_ ( new_spain ), 
   having greek blood is n't the same as being greek . 
  i never said otherwise . 
   the populations of the black sea were hellenized in the past yes , that 's at least partially true , but `` in the past '' in this case means about [ 2000 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_pontus ) to [ 2800 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/archaic_greece ) years ago . 
  according to this definition , all modern greeks are descended from people who were hellenized once . 
  well , all of my ancestors hail from the general trabzon area ( to my knowledge ) . 
  they counted themselves as greek for millennia and so do i. 
  should n't i ? 
  are you about to slap me with some stone cold facts and make me question my existence ? 
  call it * carolingian empire * . 
  you 're a mix of many ethnicities . 
  hellenic , anatolian , middle-eastern , caucasian , balkan , persian , etc. 
  if you personally hail from the inland black sea region or a few other places where greek populations historically converted to islam en masse , then it 's likely you have more greek blood in you than most turks . 
  i can . 
  and it 's better this way . 
  turkey is too democratic and liberal to enter our * fascist union * ^ ^ tm . 
   * iod\u00e1il * that 's a weird rendition of `` italy '' . 
  looks like you could stick it anywhere in middle earth . 
  [ lactose tolerance ] ( http://www.popsci.com/sites/popsci.com/files/styles/large_1x_/public/import/2013/images/2013/08/lactasemaps.jpg?itok=nzu8j8l3 ) is suggestive of such fads as well . 
  serious question : was there ever any hard proof of gulen 's orchestration of the coup apart from erdogan saying so ? 
  he was born in greece , but he 's of northern european stock . 
  whether he counts as a greek or not is a matter of the good ol' nationality debate . 
  the upper map includes the azores . 
  i 'd rather have the evil spirits chase * them * away . 
  we still have one month left . 
  better brace for more audacious stupidity till then . 
   first stop , sacking constantinople , as is tradition . 
  at least this time the crusaders will actually sack a muslim city like they were supposed to . 
  every time the city was sieged and sacked in its history , it had a christian population behind its walls . 
  alright , but apart from providing food , regulating the water cycle , creating oxygen , being used for medicinal purposes , and sustaining life what have the plants * really * ever done for us ? 
   greek left wing group just claimed responsibility sure , if you can call an anarchist-nihilist militant group `` left wing '' . 
  problem is scotland 's economy . 
  scotland would need to have a stable currency of its own independent state before gaining access to the eu . 
  its economic stability has a lot to do with the fact that it 's part of the uk . 
  outside of it , there 's no knowing for certain how it 's going to fare . 
   gilbraterians ( the fuck do you call those rock outcasts ) if you know how to spell * gibraltar * , just add '' - ian '' at the end . 
  reassembling * balkan league * ^ ^ tm in 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... 
  that was when people still paid for newspapers . 
  now , with everything online and ( mostly ) free , many journalist publications have to resort to add revenue ( among subscriptions and donations ) to bring their bread to the table . 
  populist articles and clickbait titles are confirmed to bring more people in , which is all they have to do to keep themselves afloat . 
  it 's not only the internet news media that should be blamed for this , it 's the internet age as a whole . 
  the drawn-on people on the side of that building are giving me the creeps . 
  it 's the second largest landowner after the government , they have part tax exemption ( used to be * full * exemption ) , and they 're estimated to have up to $ 15bn including all of their assets . 
  but fuck if they use any of it to help the dire situation we 're in ... to be fair to them , though , they do a lot of work with providing shelter and food for the very poor . 
   and if they do n't have enough money you * know * they do . 
  like a mountain range or something ... weird . 
  moscow * `` the eye of sauron '' * , russia makes me feel uncomfortable ... 
  they should 've thought of that before choosing that name . 
  now they 'll pay !, 
   * `` in future we do not want animal products from holland [ ... ] we have our own quality breeds . 
  '' * it 's true . 
  some of them are even running their government . 
  we had the exact same issue during the mid-to-late 20th century . 
  is n't this directly connected to both countries ' housing crisis , though ? 
  that 's true . 
  if brexit was n't a thing , scotland would n't be interested in another independence referendum and sturgeon could n't pass one even if she wanted to . 
  do n't you guys have the same thing , but just use plain 's ' in the end ? 
  so yous ends up soundings sorts of likes gollum ... 
  nasty little latvianses ... :p, 
  there 's no universe in which bosnia ( * any * part of it ) chooses turkey over the eu , so there 's that . 
  i actually agree on this part . 
  the referendum went from `` non-binding '' to `` the people of britain have chosen brexit '' literally overnight . 
  meanwhile , zurich ranked second for multiple years in a row . 
  could we get a vienna-zurich rivalry ( akin to netherlands-finland ) in / r/europe , pls ? 
  we need more banter . 
  easter sunday . 
  which , by the way , occurs on the same day for all christians this year . 
  in any case , it 'll be a cause for celebration ( and/or condemnation ) for all of europe . 
  your guess is as good as any . 
  it 's going to be a shitshow for both sides . 
  i did n't say you forced them ; just that your prior decision left them with no other choice . 
  in any case , i was mostly jesting . 
  the irish could 've chosen schengen over open border with n.i. 
  `` goats are ugly and really unattractive . '', 
  because you want to prove to the rest of your pack that you 're a fearless alpha dog and they should follow your every command . 
  at least that 's what erdog 's doing ... 
  [ appropriate ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkwzm8tdea0 ) ^ ^ ( maybe ), 
   i guess we can chuck in freedom of movement ... not if we beat you to it . 
   you guys kept ireland out of schengen . 
  we wo n't allow you to do the same thing for our dear canada . 
  it 's the same thing about trump losing the popular vote , but winning the presidency because of the electoral college .
