  if anyone believes the outcome of a vote is unfair and undemocratic , then they must challenge the institutions responsible for establishing these rules * before * the vote takes place . 
  the electoral college should have been repealed if considered undemocratic and the british eu referendum 's simple majority vote should have been increased to 2/3rds of even 3/4ths * before * the referendum 's date was announced and * way before * the vote actually took place . 
  no one should be allowed to complain that the system 's outcome is unfair only after they willfully participated in it . 
  japan has something similar with the us , but it recently found a loophole around it . 
  ireland wanted to sign the schengen agreement , but joining would mean it would lose its open border with the north , so it opted-out of it . 
  the uk 's choice against schengen was the main influence there . 
  i read that as `` la ** b ** rador '' for a second there ... 
  tyranny of the plurality then . 
  tyranny of the majority . 
   since sparta does not exist anymore what ?!,

  what happened to it ?

  * french : * yay !,

  it 's true that discrimination against gypsies grows rampant all over europe , but it 's also true that most gypsies refuse to assimilate , obey social laws , send their children to school , and pay taxes among other things . 
  both sides are at fault here . 
  ca n't say i 'm surprised . 
  it 's hard * not * to compose a piece of art staring at this view ... 
  * this just in : basket case president thinks he can order the world around . 
  flatlanders need to stay together . 
  logic had to be sacrificed in the name of art . 
  they also tried to rename * french fries * to * freedom fries * , effectively making the word ` french ' synonymous with ` freedom ' .

   all i am saying that a xenophobic german could definitely think greeks are less european or less white or whatever even if this is not as common as against turkish people . 
  that 's probably true , but i do n't think anyone should care about what colour xenophobic people apply to others . 
  greek people are generally `` less white '' than germans , but this does n't make them any less european . 
  ethiopians are usually lighter-skinned than the congolese . 
  does this mean they 're any less african ? 
   are you choosing to ignore the cultural impact on greece by turkish culture ? 
  nope . 
  never said anything like that . 
   greeks are european for sure but in truth there are more similarities between greece and turkey than greece and germany . 
  yeah , we have many similarities . 
  and we have many differences . 
  nothing wrong with either . 
  my point was about integration in other european societies , which greek immigrants have been evidently more successful at than their turkish counterpart . 
  no , they * do * display multiculturalism , but it does n't clash with the already existing sociocultural customs and laws . 
  whether this comes from people 's respect for their host country or somewhat similar cultures , i ca n't tell for sure . 
  what i * can * tell , though , is that it works . 
  you can ask any german you want whether they 'd prefer a greek neighbour or a turkish one . 
  the answer to this question will tilt to one of these sides tenfold . 
  i do n't deny that olive-skinned greeks are common , but so are pale-skinned ones . 
  calling us `` brown '' , however , is simply not accurate . 
  unless you include most other southern europeans in the definition of this term . 
   * many could argue greece is also not a real european country . 
  * we 're literally the ones who created the notion of europe . 
  if we 're not europeans , nobody is . 
  what matters here , though , is that greeks in germany are very well-integrated . 
  they may not consider themselves germans , but they do n't cause social trouble for other german citizens . 
  turks are one of the least integrated nations in germany , austria , the netherlands , and other european countries . 
   * and germans are white , while greeks are brown . 
  * my pasty white skin disagrees with your colour blindness . 
  we do n't `` need him to be assassinated '' . 
  that will only make him a martyr and strengthen the public support of his successor . 
  what we need is for the turkish people to dispose of him through vote or through protest . 
  it 's not irrelevant at all . 
  the more bravado the turkish government exports , the more votes their president will get in april 's referendum . 
  they know very well what it is they 're doing . 
  species : * turcus domesticus * genus : * turcus * family : * ottomani * order : * muslimani * class : * mammalia * phylum : * chordata * kingdom : * animalia *, 
  yeah , but that terrorism came from within the british isles , not the european mainland . 
   * president erdogan said at a rally in istanbul threatened to retaliate by blocking dutch flights . 
  * more tourists for us , then . 
  yay !, 
  you 'd be surprised on the amount of people who actually think this is the correct form . 
  [ hy-brasil ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brasil_ ( mythical_island \\ ) ) confirmed ? 
  yeah , i got nothing better than this . 
  in any case , the whole situation is a clusterfuck and neither side seems willing to back away . 
  okay . 
  better example . 
  it 's like a company with equal shareholders . 
  one of them is trying to leave the company and take their share , but the rest of the shareholders have to agree to it . 
  cornwall will be fine . 
  i hear poldark is mining tin there . 
  it 's true that there is a legal , constitutional way to do it , but it seems really sketchy at best . 
  ~ ~ it 's like a slave being offered his freedom , but only if his slaveholder agrees to it ( extreme example , but humour me ) ~ ~ . 
  yes , it 's according to the law , but it really pushes the ethical barrier of the situation . 
  * edit : * altered triggering example ; see below . 
   funny thing is catalonia actually is very similar to crimea in that it was militarily annexed by force . 
  what is your source for this ? 
  anywhere i 've looked at , it says catalonia joined the crown of aragon ( 1162 ) , which later joined the crown of castile in a personal union ( 1469 ) through royal marriage . 
  this organically led to the kingdom of spain later on . 
  last time catalonia was annexed by someone it was by napoleonic france in 1812 . 
  not all of belgium ; only flanders . 
  wallonia is a * r\u00e9gion fran\u00e7aise * in denial . 
  oh , yeah , georgia has a great amount of wonderful wines . 
  they could give france a run for its money if they had better marketing skills . 
  * saperavi * comes from a georgian variety of grapes . 
  it 's very commonplace , but solid quality . 
  australian culture is by and large european ( mostly british islander ) ; music is a cultural art , so it checks out . 
  i think they mean if it was accepted that jews stay in israel because there is n't anywhere else to put them . 
  i 'll cry unionist tears of joy when i see a colourful mariachi band ascending the stage .
