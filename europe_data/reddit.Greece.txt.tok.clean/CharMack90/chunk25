  what if they slide the channel islands your way ? 
  just 10 seconds . 
  it involves the european leaders sitting in a parisian corner restaurant eating shawarma . 
  the british prime minister sits alone on a bench across the street eating the same shawarma , only colder and with older meat . 
  you mean that the uk opted out of the schengen agreement because they foresaw the terror wave in europe two decades after the treaty was signed ? 
  i seriously doubt that british politicians are so clairvoyant . 
  the uk did n't want to be part of schengen because , being an island nation , it has better ways to deal with illegal immigration ( like using its navy ) . 
  ireland was very interested in joining schengen . 
  doing so , however , would mean it would have to lose its northern irish open border , which it valued more , so it opted out as well . 
  that was a [ chameleon ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/e9/41/58/e94158e9bf32238a36d8cb8939b1a1e8.gif ) . 
  or lisbon/porto to flores or corvo . 
  or are n't there any non-stop flights between these places ? 
   they cant be full fledged priests if they are not married . 
  are you sure about this ? 
  i ca n't find any such info about orthodox priests . 
  the way i see it , unmarried priests usually become monastics ( hieromonks ) and there is n't anyone forcing them to marry . 
  they 're just not allowed to remarry . 
  lots of chickens , though ... 
  which russian fairytale character has a pet iguana ? 
  i do n't think they 're forced to have a wife . 
  it 's just that , if they 're planning to get married , they must do it before ordainment . 
  it 's anschluss time !, 
  was n't western poland mainly populated by eastern poles ( from the lost kresy territories ) after the germans were expelled ? 
  yeah , that 's true .

  and legally drive a car at 16 . 
   i 'm guessing alot of the good outdoor must come from spain . 
  from morocco * through * spain , to be exact . 
  there 's no `` reality of the situation '' . 
  it 's all in the terminology . 
  the uk calling itself a `` country of countries '' is n't any more * real * than north korea calling itself the `` democratic people 's republic '' of korea . 
  if we are to accept the uk as such , then we should also accept that germany is comprised of 16 countries , spain of 19 , switzerland of 26 , etc. 
  depends on what you call a `` country '' . 
  by this logic , you can call germany , austria , switzerland , and spain a `` country of countries '' . 
  difference is that they use the term state/canton/autonomous province instead of * country * . 
  denmark is also comprised of so called `` countries '' in the danish realm ( denmark proper , the faroe islands , and greenland ) , but you 'll never hear anyone call it a `` country of countries '' . 
  the main reason this idiosyncratic `` country of countries '' thing came to be in the uk has to do with the presence of a scottish and northern irish ( back when it was part of ireland ) state before the union was established . 
  wales was only included because it would seem unfair if it did n't , even though it was never an independent state outside england . 
  in effect , though , the uk is one country that - for mostly historical and not so political reasons - likes to pretend it 's a union of four countries . 
  england :  * scottish ref 2014 : * better together . 
   * eu membership ref 2016 : * well , actually ... 
  i think it mostly has to do with home ownership . 
  a flat in central london can easily surpass # 1,000,000 on the market . 
  owning one instantly makes you a millionaire . 
  the credit suisse research institute has a great reputation and is held in high regard worldwide . 
  if their research is n't considered trustworthy , then pretty much nothing else is . 
  in any case , i provided the source for people to examine themselves and draw their own conclusions of whether it has merit or not . 
   according to the report there is a significant higher number of dollar millionaires , which may fuel that perception . 
  that 's very true . 
  almost 5 % of the uk 's adult population are millionaires . 
  that 's incredibly high . 
  only the us have more millionaires per capita ( ~ 6.5 of the adult pop ) . 
  ** hungary ** has the lowest percentage of wealth held by the top 1 % ( worldwide ) . 
  ** russia ** has the highest . 
  it reminds me of [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_twelve_apostles_ ( victoria \\ ) ) , in australia . 
  i do n't know where you get your info from , but there 's no such thing as a `` scandinavian '' language . 
  linguistically speaking , there are the [ north germanic languages ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/lenguas_n%c3%b3rdicas.png ) . 
  danish , swedish , and norwegian are the continental subset of these languages . 
  they are closely related with a certain degree of intelligibility between them , but they are different languages , with different standards . 
  the term `` scandinavian , may be used to refer to them , but - as it says in the [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_germanic_languages ) -  the term * scandinavian * arose in the 18th century as a result of the early linguistic and cultural scandinavist movement , referring to the people , cultures , and languages of the three scandinavian countries and stressing their common heritage . 
   english is taught from kindergarten ... 
  damn , that 's super early !, 
  has it caught up with the younger folk ? 
  norway is n't in the eu , that 's why its official language is n't included . 
   finnish and swedish are not connected . 
  you must have misread the map . 
   swedish , norwegian and danish are all dialects of scandinavian . 
  they are all scandinavian * languages * , not dialects . 
  paleolithic people did n't actually live in caves . 
  at least not for long periods of time . 
  the lived in temporary small wooden houses or yurts and , due to their nomadic lifestyle , they would have to move around constantly . 
  most women , even if they did n't go far from the settlement , would have seen some of this megafauna during their lifetimes . 
  anyone else tanking through the last quarter ? 
  no one ... ? 
  okay . 
  no , it 's just that a giraffe has a long neck like a camel and spotted hide like a leopard . 
  it 's not that silly if you think about it . 
  there 's also a [ constellation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/camelopardalis ) and the scientific name of the [ nubian giraffe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nubian_giraffe ) named after the greek name for the animal . 
  oh , yes . 
  if his story was made into a hollywood film , you bet your ass it would end with the ash-scattering scene . 
  compared to other muslim-majority nations in the general region , turkish women * do * `` have it good '' there . 
  when it comes to comparing them to women 's lives west of turkey , they choose to conveniently ignore the facts . 
  the black sea is cold and dreary compared to the mediterranean . 
  the beaches are also vastly inferior and the tourism industry as a whole is n't as advanced as it is to the south . 
  * li * is an archaic form of modern * gli * . 
  i , for one , welcome our baltic lobster-skinned overlords . 
  i wish our islands would stop getting in the way of your ships , mr erdo . 
  placing purple halfway between red and green does n't make much sense either . 
   i imagine tourism contributes a hell of a lot to greece 's economy . 
  i might be wrong but i think without tourism greece would be dirt poor . 
  tourism sure is one of our main incomes , but we would n't be * dirt * poor if we did n't have it . 
  just poorer and probably venturing more towards other sectors of economy . 
   * the iron statue of notre-dame de france ( the virgin mary ) overlooking the town was designed by the french sculptor jean-marie bonnassieux , and is made from 213 russian cannons taken in the siege of sevastopol ( 1854 -- 1855 ) .
