  losing the majority of votes after almost a full century . 
  this is pretty big news . 
  i 'm not sure / r/europe is definitively against catalan separatism . 
  i think people in here seem very divided on the matter . 
  they 're even divided on eu 's purpose and future as a whole . 
  not really . 
  scotland had a legal referendum because london allowed it . 
  catalonia does n't have a legal referendum because madrid does n't allow it . 
  the eu has nothing to do with it . 
  if anything , the ep respects each member 's internal affairs and does n't choose sides when matters arise . 
  to my knowledge , people are largely okay with it . 
  you can keep talking using gender-neutral terms and people wo n't even notice unless you specifically bring attention to it . 
  you gain something , you lose something ... 
   i 'll also volunteer to watch ballox boxes in my area . 
  we 're counting on you to spill the beans the day of the referendum in case something shady goes down in your polling station . 
  just make sure your have a good vpn installed for safety purposes .

  yeah , they started with / p - / in the indo-european language , but they evolved to / f - / in proto-germanic due to [ grimm 's law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grimm%27s_law ) . 
  greek had no influence on this phenomenon .

  no , because i read it in english , not chinese . 
  the chinese pronounce it like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huiafsbq5nc ) , with an initial ** p - ** sound . 
  do n't call my name , do n't call my name , finrando ... 
  i mean , [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/standard_chinese_phonology#consonants ) is hard to be invalidated ...  * [ ... ] in pinyin they denote aspirated/unaspirated pairs , for example / p\u02b0 / and / p / are represented with p and b respectively * ... but i 'm not gon na discredit your hearing comprehension . 
  it 's more of an alveolar ** r ** . 
  the tongue does n't curl back enough to make it retroflex . 
  yeah , i just meant that - when using the latin alphabet to transcribe chinese - you use ** b ** for / p / and ** p ** for / p\u02b0 / . 
  ` bolan ' would sound closer to `` polan '' for a polish speaker . 
  it comes from holland , not orange . 
  ` b ' is pronounced like a / p / , though . 
  it 's basically `` polan '' . 
  lol, 
  this is kind of pointless without a pronunciation guide . 
  only the japanese versions are straightforward . 
  yeah , the ones on the left are closer to canapes than sandwiches . 
  that 's what i thought , thanks . 
  even worse , their concern for `` human life '' seems to only extend to controlling women 's bodies . 
  once that baby is born , they could n't care less what happens to it . 
  if the title is a question ... ^ ^ ^ ( you ^ ^ know ^ ^ how ^ ^ it ^ ^ goes ), 
  how are the buildings and the ground so perfectly lit , though ? 
  is the sky cloudless and sunny behind the camera or is it photoshopped ? 
  rallying indoors is hard unless you book an entire stadium for the event . 
  german courts could make it illegal to hold political rallies in public open areas ( which is n't a bad idea when it comes to safety reasons ) . 
  if the turkish minister wants to hold a mini-rally in the lounge or the conference room of a hotel or something , he should be free to do so .

  but imagine the overly complex , kafkaesque , painstakingly bureaucratic procedures that would have to commence before the die was even decided whether or not to be cast ...

  how do you pronounce `` thiou '' ?

  we basically tie a red-and-white thread or ribbon around our wrist and call it ' \u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 ' ( march ) . 
  it 's much more common for children , allegedly to prevent the `` hot '' sun of march from burning their faces . 
  they wear it for the duration of the month and - after taking it off - they traditionally place it on rosebushes for the first swallows of spring to find and use it to make their nests . 
  it 's an ancient balkan custom , believed to hail from the [ eleusinian mysteries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eleusinian_mysteries ) . 
  do n't worry ; you 're still gon na get there before we do . 
   so happy spring holiday to bulgarians , macedonians , romanians and moldavians - be white and red , lively and strong  hey , we have that custom too !, 
  slay him , sebby !, 
  remove that kebab !, 
  is the picture mirrored ? 
  no , that 's king leopold ii . 
  i was referring to the first one of his name . 
  / u/arathian 's got some splainin ' to do ... 
  we do , but it sounds silly when referring to an upvote button . 
  king leopold did . 
  that idiot turned down the crown of greece to rule belgium , of all places !, 
  yes , i was just adding up my opinion . 
  i do n't disagree with your point , though . 
  you 're welcome . 
  i agree with this sentiment . 
  i often cringe when i come across an irish town name . 
  it reminds me of all the towns with anglified native american names in the us . 
  my guess ( though i 'm neither irish nor an expert on the subject ) is that many irish people would n't be able to read the original town names since most of them do n't speak gaelic anymore . 
  i 'm also pretty sure that both the anglicised and the original gaelic versions of place-names are displayed on signs in ireland , but most people go with the anglicised versions when referring to them . 
  peeling onions as usual ... 
  nothing to see here . 
  turkey has been trying to create `` grey zones '' in the aegean since the 70s . 
  you can read more [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aegean_dispute ) . 
  that 's because ireland was part of the uk back then . 
  then let denmark and norway do the comparisons . 
  the us should n't be comparing crime statistics unless they want to depress themselves . 
  yeah , i assume only the eventual death of putin might bring some change to russia . 
  so the president of finland has a main residence , a summer residence , * and * the presidential palace ? 
  serbia and croatia have plenty of reasons to be divided . 
  ca n't we just use tesla 's legacy as a reason for ( cultural , not political ) unity between the two nations ? 
  i think splitting the difference between romania , serbia , croatia , austria , and the us would drop tesla somewhere in the middle of the atlantic . 
  oh , my good catholic portugal ... 
  apparently , it 's very common all over armenia .
