  old buildings built mostly during the 19th century were mainly made of basalt , so they have this very dark colour . 
  i 'd personally want to visit the ( south - ) western coast more than anything else . 
  according to the 1951 refugee convention of the united nations , a refugee is :  `` a person who owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or ** political opinion , is outside the country of his nationality ** and is unable or , owing to such fear , is ** unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country ** ; or who , not having a nationality and ** being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events , is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to return to it . 
  ** '' i say they count as refugees . 
  insulting my comment and my education ... top kek !, 
  she 's really famous in / r/vexillology . 
  the incarceration rate of african american males is more than three times higher than the national average and more than six times higher than that of white males . 
  or do n't you think that african americans count as a minority in the us ? 
  almost one-and-a-half century after abolition of slavery in the us and no government has managed to raise black people as a whole from the second rate citizens that they 've always been and you claim that the us is `` more progressed '' than sweden when it comes to crime ? 
  you seem willfully ignorant of the subject . 
  np picture needed . 
  the name of this `` establishment '' is vomit-inducing by itself . 
  people of any ethnicity and cultural background born and brought up in another country often have a romanticised version of their cultural homeland in their minds . 
  * fun facts about greece - lots of fun in greece .

  we basically call it `` roosterbird '' . 
  how stupid is that ? 
  it means absolutely nothing here . 
  beat that !,

  maybe , but calling a jewish person an `` infidel by parisian beliefs '' is * seriously * stretching it . 
  beirut , lebanon has a substantial christian population . 
  does this mean that muslims are `` infidels by beiruti beliefs '' ? 
   * paris ... cultural center of islam in europe ... one of the worst infidels by parisian beliefs . 
  do n't you think a thing or two changed since the last referendum ? 
  a thing or two that most scots did n't want to change ? 
  a thing or two that would justify another independence referendum for scotland ? 
  they have to achieve their [ pre-famine level of population ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/population_of_ireland_and_europe_1750_to_2005.svg/540px-population_of_ireland_and_europe_1750_to_2005.svg.png ) . 
  so it 's sort of a challenge for them . 
  seriously talking , how likely is that the nhs is purposely underfunded so that private health services and insurances will be increased in the uk ? 
  this must be just owned dogs . 
  if we include strays , the numbers will change considerably . 
  economically yes , but on a political level , the eu should be able to achieve more without the uk halting it . 
  that should ( in theory ) provide the eu with greater economic prospects in the future . 
  pls gib . 
  not according to them , who are certain there was a ( quite curiously ) 3 million voter fraud in ( mostly democrat ) california without any evidence to back this claim up . 
  [ and spanish and catalan .

  a wise choice . 
   * bulgarian is easier to understand to a russian speaker than ukrainian . 
  * i was referring to that comment , though . 
  i reckon it 's because of our history these last few centuries . 
  our influence was diminished during ottoman rule , and we never felt particularly close to the turks ( different culture , religion , language , etc ) . 
  after we gained our independence , other balkan nations that had also been under ottoman rule like us ( serbs , bulgarians , albanians ) had different languages and cultures and they had each other ( the south slavs ) or they were mostly muslim ( albanians ) , so we were left alone . 
  austria and hungary were once under the same king . 
  the nordics were under the same union or even shared monarchs . 
  the british had the irish , the poles had the lithuanians , etc. 
  we never had anything like that . 
  history left us somewhat detached and alone . 
  the whole time i was wondering : `` what * economic growth * ? '', 
  ** reading ** comprehension and ** speaking ** comprehension are two very different things . 
  for example , it 's rather easy for spaniards to understand written portuguese . 
  spoken portuguese , though , would be almost entirely unintelligible to them . 
  greece as a country ? 
  - cyprus . 
  greece as a nation ? 
  - really ca n't say . 
  no neighbour or political ally feels like a * close * friend . 
  i do n't see anything but a levitating pink phone in that picture . 
  i could 've sworn pizza is more common .

  measles is also an extremely contagious disease which makes the possibility of a pandemic a very valid concern . 
  ~ ~ a little fyi : spaniards do n't usually refer to neighbourhoods as * barrios * . 
  that 's mostly a latin american thing . ~ ~ * edit : * nvm . 
   cats do n't have religion ... that 's not true . 
  they all worship satan . 
  it is known . 
  yeah , that map shows which ethnicity people joke about apart from their own . 
  no it does n't !, 
  a birth certificate costs 5 $ in all instances , whether the infant 's parents are married or not . 
  only difference is that both parents need to sign a recognition of parentage statement if they 're not married . 
  it may be a bit of a hassle to get the paperwork , but it does n't cost * thousands of euros * !, 
  i agree with that sentiment and as much as i hate myself for propagating this divide , i just ca n't - for the life of me - respect the people who voted for trump . 
  i 've tried to have an open mind and see things objectively ; tried to give them a chance to explain their line of thought , but they 're horrible in defending their choice . 
  the best of them chose him hoping for a change from a non-establishment individual . 
  the average of them are so full of hatred and contempt that it 's hard to even listen to . 
  the worst ones , i do n't even wan na think about ... 
   in a democracy those are ** not ** the `` only ones who matter '' , exactly that is the problem . 
  i agree , but i was talking about arguing with someone online and proceed to dick-measuring . 
  i would n't want to argue with a trump supporter because i would n't even wan na give him/her the time of day . 
   it 's really as simple as that . 
  i disagree . 
  there 's direct correlation , but i do n't believe it 's a simple matter . 
  the populace does n't have a strong grip on their government , and can not be held accountable for every single thing their government does . 
  not just in the us , but worldwide . 
  but that 's just my personal view of the matter . 
  i do n't pretend it 's the most valid one , nor am i interested in stirring up controversy . 
   well they clearly do n't since they do n't have a well informed , educated and sane government in power . 
  i only partially blame the american people for trump 's presidency . 
  i mostly blame the electoral college . 
  most american citizens did n't want him as their potus and they made it very clear with their vote . 
   yet , i believe french people are the most anti-depressor consumers in europe . 
  it 's actually iceland , [ according to the oecd ] ( http://www.keepeek.com/digital-asset-management/oecd/social-issues-migration-health/health-at-a-glance-2015_health_glance-2015-en#page187 ) . 
  france is medially placed . 
  its their wacko president and his deplorable followers who do that . 
  well-informed , educated , sane americans ( the only ones who matter , really ) do n't belittle europe with every breath . 
  maybe you have 12.58 % more baby * boys * . 
  we 've been nagging about `` loss of sovereignty '' since the imf first intervened and nothing changed so far .
