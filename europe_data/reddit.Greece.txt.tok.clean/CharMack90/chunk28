  if there was any possibility of politicians behind bars , * most * greek citizens would rally * for * it not against it . 
  problem is that no parliament under any government would ever agree to such a thing . 
  that 's partly because a good amount of syriza mps jumped ship while pasok was sinking . 
  a wolf is a wolf even in sheep 's skin . 
  that 's a lie constantly repeated to the point of being considered the truth even after over a decade of its disproval . 
   * in the 2005 oecd report for greece it was clearly stated that `` the impact of new accounting rules on the fiscal figures for the years 1997 to 1999 ranged from 0.7 to 1 percentage point of gdp ; this retroactive change of methodology was responsible for the revised deficit exceeding 3 % in 1999 , the year of emu membership qualification . 
  '' *  * an error frequently made in press reports is the confusion of the discussion regarding greece 's eurozone entry with the controversy regarding usage of derivatives ' deals with us banks by greece and other eurozone countries to hide their reported budget deficits . 
  a currency swap arranged with goldman sachs allowed greece to ` hide ' 2.8 billion euros of debt , but that affected deficit values after 2001 ( when greece had already been admitted into the eurozone ) and is not related to greece 's eurozone entry .

  seems like someone 's asking for food poisoning . 
  this sounds super ominous ... 
   you have a ~ ~ love ~ ~ deep hatred for eurovision that non-europeans just do n't understand . 
  ftfy . 
  actually , [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/union_flag_1606_%28kings_colors%29.svg/1000px-union_flag_1606_%28kings_colors%29.svg.png ) was the flag of great britain before 1801 . 
  seriously ?!, 
  sure , it 's got a lot of character to it , but you 've got to be some sort of mazochist to prefer living there over other areas in athens . 
  it 's ` panta rei ' in the erasmian pronunciation of ancient greek , which flourished in europe during the renaissance . 
  italians almost always use this pronunciation when uttering ancient greek . 
  * \u039c\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 * ( ` melissa ' - stressed on the first syllable ) = bee/honeybee .

  the oceanographic museum of monaco - [ land side ] ( http://expo.oceano.mc/images/articles/1290860218.jpg ) , [ sea side ] ( http://www.oceano.mc/photos_site/1347379202.jpg ) - is one of my favourite buildings in the world . 
  it 's visible on the picture in the centre of the elevated [ monaco-ville ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monaco_city ) . 
  i do n't know about schengen , but implementing a single fiscal union means having all ez member-states agree on the taxation of all other members . 
  currently , this is next to impossible to be agreed upon . 
  giving up control of your fiscal policies is giving up a big part of your sovereignty . 
  no state is willing to do that . 
   you were fucking lucky you did n't get communism i was responding to that . 
  not an attack , but it refers to [ this ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/us-intelligence-and-the-polish-crisis-1980-1981/index.htm ) . 
  most of the people i 've seen comment on sweden 's immigration problem in / r/europe are swedes themselves . 
  14 for most professions , 16 for education . 
   * the authorities have been given one month to satisfy these demands -- till march 17 this year . 
  * or ... what ? 
  this does n't mean it ca n't be a threat to world peace ( not that i believe it is ) . 
  maybe the aussies could see into the future and get a vision of an orange blob sometime after 2016 . 
  it reminds me of [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qmgya4a.jpg ) . 
  * edit-disclaimer * : the picture is n't 100 % correct . 
   and you think that anywhere in europe communism was welcome greatly ? 
  i did n't say that . 
  greeks fighting against communism does n't mean nobody else did . 
  these things are n't interlinked . 
   you have fierce civil war between two domestic forces , no outside powers were involved . 
  actually , they were . 
  the uk and us backed one side and yugoslavia backed the other side . 
  greeks tried to fight against it and won ( with major losses ) , while poles , latvians , hungarians etc lost and were subjected to the ussr and/or its influence . 
  people died to support their cause . 
  i 'm glad we escaped communism , but i do n't think it 's fair to call it a matter of `` luck '' . 
  it was n't `` luck '' we did n't have a communist government . 
  we fought a bloody [ civil war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_civil_war ) to prevent it from happening !, 
  and that war came right after an already miserable and disastrous axis occupation during wwii . 
  we had help from the uk and the us of course , but do n't insult the memory of those who died to not let communism affect greece by saying it was `` luck '' . 
  was wroclaw one of the polish cities bombarded and rebuilt after wwii ? 
  or did this part in the picture escape destruction ? 
  every time i look at a picture of porto , this bridge is in it . 
  i 'm still not sure if i like it or not . 
  it does n't match its surroundings at all , but it 's a nice-looking bridge and has a lot of character to it . 
  i should visit and see it from up close before i decide . 
  i 'm pretty sure they 're famous all over the world , and especially in europe . 
  i considered this as a possibility , but the existence of other cities in the area , like manaus , makes it not entirely true . 
  if a city with 10 times the population of french guiana can exist in the centre of the amazon rainforest , then fg can be more populated as well . 
  i mean actual british food , not appropriated indian food . 
  though , i admit , british style tikka masala is delicious . 
  even if some people would prefer turkish food over greek food , there 's no healthy human palate in existence that prefers british food over greek food . 
  or was this a troll ? 
  [ imbros and tenedos ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/imbrostenedos_2.svg/725px-imbrostenedos_2.svg.png ) sure look tasty enough . 
  and they historically had a much stronger greek presence over the turkish one , during * and * after the ottoman years . 
  almost all greeks of both islands were driven out by state-sponsored persecution ( like the * eritme programmi * operation ) during the 60s and 70s . 
  i 've visited istanbul twice and , from my experiences with modern turks of the city , they 'd prefer having greeks in the city over kurds and eastern anatolian turks . 
  it 's odd how a region the size of austria has only a little over 250,000 people living in it . 
  french guiana has the population density of iceland , but with a much more habitable climate and environment . 
  same more-or-less goes with guyana and suriname . 
  they are grossly underpopulated , which is good news for their rainforests , though . 
  \u266b \u266a * oh , there once was a redditor named c4h8 . 
  * * he signed up for admiralship on a oceanless state . 
  * * there were no requirements , duty or pay . 
  * * but he did it regardless thinking it 'd be child 's play . 
  * * he sat all day long on a blustery field . 
  * * with nor warships nor gunboats to guard and to shield . 
  * * and wasting his life on nebraska 's dry land . 
  * * he finally uttered : `` this did not go as planned !, 
   * it is not a military rank , requires no duties , and carries with it no pay or other compensation . 
  does the money for new infrastructure come from kosovars themselves or is there foreign aid involved ? 
  saurali\u00f6ndfokk sure is beautiful !, 
  you 'd think that after 3 centuries , the english would 've learned how to make good whiskey . 
  well , you and i are n't like that . 
  so , it 's not like there are n't exceptions . 
   * the fire completely destroyed the greek and armenian quarters of the city ; the muslim and jewish quarters escaped damage . 
  * [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_fire_of_smyrna ), 
  no , that 's actually monaco . 
  its population 's median age is 52 . 
  that 's the highest in the world . 
  or alaska back to russia . 
  that 's true . 
  it 's also true that nowhere in this post ( title or descriptions ) is there any mention of a `` state '' . 
  the way i see it , the british government 's focus tends to be too london-centric . 
  anything off the m25 tends to be more-or-less equally scorned , whether it 's in england , scotland , or anywhere else . 
  excuse me , but how does this post `` propagate false statehood '' ? 
  * republika srpska * is a legal entity of bih . 
  the post does n't imply anything else as far as i can tell . 
  just the greek and armenian quarters .
