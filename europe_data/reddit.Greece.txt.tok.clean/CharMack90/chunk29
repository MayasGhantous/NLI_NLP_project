  on a more positive note , the more this orange gibbon ruins the republican party that still ( somehow ) supports him , the more likely it is for democrats to slay in the 2018 representative and senate elections and finally get the majority they need to get something positive done . 
  i 'm sure polan will into space when greece pays denbts . 
  i mean , they drive on the * right * side of the road . 
  literally . 
  do you perchance know if the * polismyndigheten * is competent enough to deal with something like this , should it happen ? 
  it was n't empty , it just did n't have any people involved in the trojan war ( according to homer ) . 
  that being said , the western parts are largely mountainous and the northern parts did n't have that many greeks back then . 
  * i agree with you , but if the greek quarter had n't been burnt down in 1922 , the ` greek vibe ' would be stronger . 
   i do n't think you have anymore muslims we do , actually . 
  western thrace ( especially rhodope and xanthi ) have thousands of muslims ( turks and pomaks ) from before the independence wars . 
  europeans are nothing but romantics .

   * the main political purpose of the [ baltic republican party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_republican_party ) was the establishment of an autonomous baltic republic instead of the kaliningrad region , possibly total independence . 
  it also wanted the old name k\u00f6nigsberg restored . 
  * we need to bring this back . 
  yes , ertafitaj\u00f3g\u00fart . 
  as long as eyramykjaj\u00f6tunn does n't explode , iceland will be fine .

  where i worked , there were almost exclusively germans , russians , and tourists from balkan states ( mostly bulgaria and serbia ) . 
  among them , some of the russians would be the worst , but the vast majority would still be very nice . 
  balkanites would be the cheapest and less likely to spend money , which makes sense considering they come from poorer countries ( the russians we 'd have would be at least upper middle class by russian standards ) . 
  we had almost no other nationalities where i worked , but i 've heard from several co-workers in other hotels around the country that the british are usually the worst of the bunch . 
  especially groups of 20-somethings that get horribly drunk and stupid 24/7 . 
  families and older individuals tend to be much more decent , though . 
  yes , but vaporland has a worse healthcare and education system than iceland . 
  having worked at a hotel with about 40 % german tourists , i can easily say that germans are among the nicest and most cooperative of tourists . 
  that being said , there were n't any substantial cases of bad blood between the two nations . 
  tourism from germany has only been going up since the crisis hit . 
  oddest thing about it is that the state ( originally territory ) of washington was at first going to be named * columbia * , named after the columbia river flowing through the state . 
  however , the government was afraid people might confuse it with d.c. ( district of columbia ) . 
  so they named it * washington * , which cleared out things nicely . 
  all civil protests against an abusive government , yes . 
   ** in ankara : ** * small crowds outside the university in the turkish capital chanted slogans against the ruling ak party , including `` akp will be held accountable '' and `` shoulder to shoulder against fascism '' , while brawls erupted as police forced people away from the campus entrances . 
  *  ** in kiev : ** * by 25 january 2014 , the protests ( of euromaidan ) had been fueled by the perception of `` widespread government corruption , '' `` abuse of power , '' and `` violation of human rights in ukraine . 
  '' * they seem pretty comparable to me . 
  i think raygun made a comparison to [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euromaidan ) . 
  simple and snarky is definitely the way to go . 
  maybe not in the following 4 or 5 years , but not even the most provident economists can be certain of brexit 's toll on the uk 's economy and how this will or wo n't be used for political purposes . 
  if the scots see the uk failing them and the eu becoming increasingly more endearing as an alternative , they could choose to leave the kingdom in 10 or 20 years from now . 
   * erdogan says the reform will provide stability at a time of turmoil and prevent a return to the fragile coalitions of the past . 
  * he 's using the fear of terrorism and political instability to practically blackmail the citizens into voting for the reform . 
  this man is a vile human being , even for a politician . 
  i agree that they 're not comparable , but / u/swamp _ thingie 's point still stands . 
  geopolitics change over time and no country is set or fixed for eternity . 
  if scotland manages to join the roi before n.i. 
  does , then anything is possible . 
  being part of the eu = / = lack of independence . 
  solar power is also finite . 
  we only have about 7 billion years of it left . 
  that 's practically tomorrow !, 
  i really like the bottled up anger , barely contained inside a courteous and well-spoken exterior . 
  it 's so british !, 
   people start to worship athletes , actors , singers , and other famous people who then use their fame in the political arena . 
  not that i disagree , but this did n't start with democracy . 
  it 's been going on since time immemorial . 
  it has more to do with human society and culture than the political system of a country . 
  do n't worry . 
  the vpn business is thriving in turkey . 
  this and because the turks of the city fled to the acropolis .

  the level of arrogance is astounding . 
  it 's like these pms are entitled to their corrupt ways and even feel insulted when called on it . 
  it 's important to note that they do it out of respect , not because of misogyny or anything like that . 
  asturias barely managed to get a sniff of that delicious kebab . 
  exactly . 
  it 's an entirely cultural thing . 
  there 's no right or wrong ; just common and uncommon . 
  maybe we should retaliate by fueling californian secessionism .

  favourite story about liechtenstein is the one about their last military expedition during the austro-prussian war in 1866 . 
  none of the 80 soldiers sent were injured or killed . 
  on the contrary , 80 soldiers left the country , but 81 returned . 
  the unit came back with a new italian friend . 
  [ here . 
  there is an annotation about that on the bottom left of the map . 
  that 's * quenya * , though . 
  it 's the old language of the elves akin to latin in our real world . 
  the language we know most about and hear in the lotr movies is * sindarin * , which is primarily based on welsh and other celtic languages . 
  it was practically yesterday !, 
  italy seriously needs to take a chill pill and stop being this gorgeous . 
  it 's making the rest of us uncomfortable . 
  i 'm sure the tourists feel safe . 
  uzung\u00f6l is a lovely place . 
  the village is one of the dozen or so than were fully coverted to islam during the 17th century .
