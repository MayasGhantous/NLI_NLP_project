   what you actually mean is the democratic process and safeguards which are defined in the constitutional principles of the british parliament . 
  either that or filibustering , which is a rather painful aspect of democracy . 
  * cologne locals and lawmakers . 
  what do they know ? 
  do they know things ? 
  let 's find out !, 
  ctrl + f * [ britain ] * - ctrl + a + delete, 
  thankfully , you 're situated in an area of europe with very little seismic activity . 
  if you mean edward viii , he was a nazi sympathiser not a nazi himself . 
  plus , that was before ww2 , so the nazis had n't done as many terrible things as they would during the war . 
  there were actually quite a few leaders and politicians around the world who did n't understand nazism 's hideousness and even talked positively about hitler until after the invasion of poland and the start of the war . 
  they 're [ really boring basic stuff ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/21/north-korea-only-28-websites-leak-official-data ) for very few people apparently . 
  and they 're not accessible from our internet . 
  i 'll have you know that north korea has 28 websites . 
  that 's right : 28 whole websites . 
  finland ; no . 
  estonia on the other hand ... 
  but what about people from other eu countries who visit or live in the roi ? 
  if irish citizens are allowed free access and work prospects in the uk , how will the uk stop the rest of eu citizens ( who can freely live and work in the roi ) to move to the uk through ireland ? 
  seems like border control is the only viable way to do it . 
  it 's easier to keep the same dynasty on the throne when you get to behead all your brothers the day you are crowned king ( according to ottoman law , mind you ) . 
  it makes the succession issue very straightforward and does n't allow many crown pretenders and the like to pop up every once in a while . 
  yet another thing to blame the british for . 
  setting up to fail already , i see . 
  good ol' british pessimism at work . 
  that 's true for most catholic ( and many protestant ) countries . 
  `` day of the dead '' is more often known as `` all soul 's day '' , though . 
  and yugoslavia . 
  in greek , some of the funniest phrases we have are : * `` there is trouble in the gypsy village , '' * -  `` who gives a shit ? '', 
  * '' ( like ) the whore 's railing/bannister , '' * -  `` a mess or a disaster . '', 
  * '' ( someone ) is riding a reed , '' * -  `` behaves all high and mighty . '', 
  * '' ( something is ) at the devil 's mother , '' * -  `` really far away . '', 
  * '' ( someone ) ate a door , '' * -  `` was denied access . '', 
  * '' ( someone ) farted doorknobs , '' * -  `` was very afraid/scared . '', 
  * `` go to the corner to see if i 'm coming '' * or * `` when you were going away i was coming back , '' * -  `` i know better than you of what you 're talking about . '', 
  * `` does the goat chew fish roe ? 
  '' * -  `` who do you think you 're fooling ? '', 
  there 's a ridiculously high number of phrases , many of which sound really weird when translated and it 's hard to find the origin ( or logic ) behind them . 
  how long have you been cultivating kiwis ? 
  and exactly which area of portugal is your orchard in ? 
  does the local climate matter much or is it pretty much the same all over the country ? 
  poles smoke less than the other countries you mentioned . 
  that 's likely one of the factors . 
  it 's actually good for it in moderation . 
  britain is part of europe . 
  and it will remain as such until the eurasian plate breaks up and pushes it into the atlantic ocean . 
   alexander the great - fyrom ** triggered . 
  yes , but it was one of the founding members of nato and that was back in 1949 . 
  the west ( and the rest of the world , really ) was n't as pro-democracy back then as it is nowadays . 
  it makes sense to feel angry about it , does n't it ? 
  what if angela merkel started hinting towards the rights of germany in western poland or orban about hungary 's rights in transylvania . 
  everyone would lose their collective shit even if it was populist rhetoric . 
  a leader of a free nation ca n't make these sort of statements and openly discredit international treaties . 
  i just wish erdogan would dip his tongue in his brain before talking . 
   only in poland was there an underground organization devoted solely to helping jews ( zegota ) that 's true . 
  you have to keep in mind , though , that jews in poland ( pre-nazi invasion ) constituted about 10 % of the country 's population . 
  more jews lived in poland than any other nazi-occupied state . 
  they were poland 's first minority and had contributed a great big deal to poland 's economy and social progress . 
  it only made sense for governmental organisations like zegota to exist in occupied poland . 
  i know , but there 's still hope that whoever gets to rule syria ( or at least the part of syria aleppo 's in ) could help rebuild the city and make it prosperous for its citizens . 
  considering that 's what syrians want and that 's also what the west wants ( due to millions of refugees and immigrants stuck in limbo inside our states ) we could also help with mending the situation and rebuilding the city . 
  actually , moldova 's 15-64 age group is at about 73 % . 
  that 's a bit higher than romania 's 68 % or ukraine 's 70 % . 
  immigration for employment is prevalent among young moldovans , but there are still plenty of young people in the country . 
  they just do n't vote as much as the older ones do . 
  that 's certainly a factor , but poland 's gdp per capita ( 1999 ) was 6 times higher than ukraine 's and 13 times higher than moldova 's even before poland 's eu accession ( 2004 ) . 
  * porco [ insert_holy_name ] *, 
  this sort of makes me feel optimistic about aleppo 's future . 
  [ four lions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/four_lions ) did that and it was a quite funny movie . 
  the us do n't care about erdogan 's moustache twirling . 
  they 'll leave him alone as long as he keeps his totalitarianism in his country . 
  now , if he tries to expand towards northern iraq and mosul ( as he threatened ) , manages to control the oil-rich areas , and makes a deal with his new buddy putin to supply ... * that 's * when shit hits the fan and the us becomes involved . 
  [ a great city indeed . 
  what 's up with the doily coastlines ? 
  this is getting scarier every day . 
  scarier for turkey , for its neighbours , and for its allies in the west . 
  nobody celebrates halloween in greece and no real butthurts about it either . 
  some people ( mostly high-schoolers or university students ) may dress up and go partying in clubs/bars that may have a special `` halloween night '' or some other crap like that , but there 's no actual celebration over it . 
  we properly dress up , party and celebrate during the carnival before lent ( late february to early march ) . 
   also carving pumpkins instead of swedes . 
  the hell ?!, 
  edit : oh ... [ swedes ] ( http://www.healthbenefitstimes.com/9/uploads/2013/07/laurentian-rutabaga.jpg ) . 
  i thought you meant [ swedes ] ( https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/sweden.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=664&amp;h=441&amp;crop=1 ) !, 
  should have taken the lack of capitalisation more seriously ... 
  that 's true , but that also applies to pretty much all neighbouring countries , all over the world . 
  traditional values and customs are more of a cultural continuum than something clearly defined by borders . 
  especially when it comes to art forms like music and dancing . 
  exactly . 
  so what austria does , is call some weaker and poorer countries to back it up so that it has more influence in eu matters . 
  i 'd call that unethical , but there 's not much ethics when it comes to politics , anyway ... 
  the catholic-majority countries that were part of the austrian ( and later austro-hungarian ) empire . 
  makes sense considering the certain amount of historical heritage they share . 
  yet , it mostly feels like austria is trying to use its influence by v4-ing itself with weaker countries so that it gets the upper hand among them . 
  germany would make the most sense for austria , but they 're not proposing getting in a bloc with them , do they ? 
  depends on what you mean `` similar '' . 
  everyday life may be somewhat alike , but since religion is intertwined with culture around these parts , it 's hard to say that turkish culture is similar to greek or bulgarian or serbian culture etc. 
  turks who emigrated from turkey to germany while adults may get a pass . 
  but their children , who were born and lived their whole lives in germany , are inexcusable . 
  they should be fluent in german and fully integrated in german society by now . 
  and language and culture and most of their biological background ( marriages between christians and muslims were very rare ) .
