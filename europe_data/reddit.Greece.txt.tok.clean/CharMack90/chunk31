  you do n't see that often . 
   ~ ~ cay ~ ~ coffee is on me . 
  ftfy . 
  we only drink tea if we have a sore throat or something . 
  hell , there 's a whole plain in mars plagiarising [ our entire country 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hellas_planitia ) name . 
  though , to be honest , having the tallest mountain in our solar system being named after our own tallest midget is pretty flattering . 
  it 's so odd that , in most countries , towns like this one would be revered as unique places of historical value and beauty , overflowing with tourists and being advertised all over the world , while - in spain 's case - they come a dime a dozen and are neither special nor particularly unique . 
  i 've never even heard of this place . 
  there is/was a total of 19 mountains carrying the name ` olympus ' since ancient times . 
  only one of them is in cyprus . 
  [ well ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edcqf_ntpoq ), 
  this is , sadly , the bane of democracy . 
  the open discussion and equal rights to veto among all democratic members make any change hard to be decided and extensive bureaucracy makes any implementation a hassle . 
  problems pile up faster than they can be solved and people are increasingly growing weary of that . 
  this is why support for democracy is waning over time . 
  people are n't willing to take democracy 's bads with the goods , so they begin opening their minds to other , less democratic options . 
   the greek government lied and falsified its economic statistics ... that 's a lie that 's been propagated for over 15 years now . 
  check out the greek financial audit of 2004 and you 'll see what the truth is . 
  though , you 're partially right . 
  nobody forced our government to adopt the euro . 
  that mistake is all on us . 
  this fortress was built by the knights hospitaller as well ( they ruled over rhodes before moving to malta ) . 
  the title is wrong . 
  ** correction : ** this is the palace of the grand master of the knights of rhodes . 
  it housed the headquarters for the [ knights hospitaller ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/knights_hospitaller ) , not the [ templar knights ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/knights_templar ) . 
  right on time !, 
  cheating , though . 
  the current trend is about forts , not castles . 
  standing proof that the knights hospitaller were the ones responsible for the first fort-boner . 
  [ it 's an odd thing , that 's for sure .

  i love how well it blends with its surroundings . 
  yeah , the serbs were n't much into reciprocating , so the bulk of the counter-offensive fell into greek hands at first . 
  thankfully , the romanian army invaded from the north and approached sofia , which finally forced bulgaria to agree to an armistice . 
  it 's a nice thing that , even though bulgaria was an asshole to its neighbours during the second balkan war and both world wars , there is n't any bad blood between us anymore . 
  we 're all balkanbros nowadays . 
  romania was a later addition . 
  they had previous beef with bulgaria and jumped on the opportunity to take back some of their lands . 
  even the ottomans joined the cause against bulgaria to take back some regions , and they were the ones the league fought against the first time . 
  there 's no denying that the bulgarian aggression of '13 was a mistake ( but yay for the rest of us ! ), 
  hardly as easy at that . 
  the [ bigger part ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/map_of_the_war_in_donbass.svg/800px-map_of_the_war_in_donbass.svg.png ) of both oblasts is under the control of the ukrainian government and the desire for unification with russia is n't as spread out as many think . 
  the whole area will continue to be a mess for years to come , unless the russian army pulls back . 
  they started it !, 
  if they had n't attacked , their country would 've probably been closer to [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/second_balkan_war.png ) right now . 
  it only lasted for about a year but it succeeded in what it achieved to accomplish . 
  it 's halfway between munich and budapest , you can easily picture it on the map . 
  they do . 
  they 're just too preoccupied with waging war against the sea , so they have n't got any time left to unleash their violent instincts . 
  yes , i saw that . 
  i was just letting everyone know what the eu member-states that are n't represented have as a passport colour . 
  op 's point regarding croatia 's special case still stands . 
  all current member-states of the eu have burgundy-coloured passports apart from croatia . 
  looks like you 're right . 
  the picture you posted makes it seem like the cable goes just by the isles of scilly , but it apparently misses their waters by a few km . 
  it still goes through [ uk territorial waters ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8010/7134837633_ce21e9104b_b.jpg ) . 
  well , between him and every other candidate , it 's no wonder some people would rather see macron elected president . 
  it 's not like any of the other choice is an obviously better one . 
  it 's every man 's game right now . 
  it 's odd how almost all of them have long hunchy noses with high bridges . 
  that kind of nose is n't actually considered no1 beauty feature nowadays , but must it have been seen as a quite elegant thing back then . 
  it was at about 2.8 % in 2008 . 
  slovaks call themselves * slov\u00e1ci * and their language * sloven\u010dina * . 
  slovenes call themselves * slovenci * their language * sloven\u0161\u010dina * . 
  it 's in cases like these when i think they may * want * us to mix them up . 
  only if you both get fucked by america . 
  croatia is to other former yugoslav republics what chile is to argentina . 
  both of them stretch as much as possible from north to south to block their neighbours from access to the western sea . 
  many slovenians do n't consider their country to be part of the balkans . 
  the way it 's worded , is as if london has a tripartite mayoral system where there must at all times be a christian mayor , a muslim mayor , and an atheist mayor ruling over the city to preserve the balance . 
  sort of like the old tricameral parliament of south africa . 
  too bad . 
  i 'm sure dozens of people would 've voted for him . 
  * dozens !, 
  ** counterproposal : ** - romandy joins france , while ticino and the italian-speaking areas join italy ( as in the map ) . 
  - the alemannic-speaking parts of baden-w\u00fcrttemberg secede and join the rest of switzerland . 
  - vorarlberg and eastern swabia join the new switzerland , while south tyrol rejoins austria . 
  - as a plus , bavaria proper joins austria , while franconia remains part of germany . 
  explain yourself . 
  you clearly see that most of those attires are clean , ornate and not very comfortable or functional . 
  back then , people used to wear their ( usually one ) good traditional attire for formal instances like marriages , major holidays , etc. 
  their everyday clothes would be similar , only dirtier , shabbier and much less ornate . 
  me neither , i 'm ashamed to admit . 
   my mother 's small door selling company is that ` doors from a small company ' or ` small doors from a company ' ? 
  '' ... unless i can ally with them for political gain . '', 
  he 's quite famous in greece , but i 'm not so sure about his twitter page . 
  i know that the one who left them is biracial . 
  the other ones all look identical to me . 
  yeah , but they ca n't say that . 
  how do they justify it ? 
  you joke , but truth is that we came very close to war during the imia/kardak crisis of ' 96 . 
  yeah , greeks ~ ~ could n't ~ ~ would n't usually build arches for some reason , as odd as that sounds . 
  edit : fixed sentence, 
  both . 
  what 's the situation on the ground floors when it comes to mold and humidity ? 
  no , it 's exports/imports of countries that are part of the eea/efta from all over the world . 
  i could n't use `` the eu '' because of switzerland and norway . 
  i do n't blame you for being confused , though . 
  my wording in the title could have been a bit more clear . 
  no , i meant that these countries are in the eea/efta .
