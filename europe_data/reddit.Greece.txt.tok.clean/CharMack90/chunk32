  maybe i should have worded it differently . 
  i would have used `` the eu '' , but switzerland and norway insisted otherwise . 
  corsica was taken over by french forces in 1769 , but was not incorporated into the french state until 1789 . 
  it has to do with the fact that it was the only state that was incorporated to the us after losing a war with them ( barring the totally `` peaceful '' annexation of hawai'i ) . 
  and corsica was n't a part of france before 1789 . 
  as it should . 
  you could try setting them across the apennines . 
  yet both are two of the most secularist nations in the world . 
  obviously , what 's written on a piece of paper ( constitution ) does n't always represent a people 's general zeitgeist . 
  do n't fret . 
  there 's always the idiotic mix-up between switzerland and sweden . 
  yeah ... 
  the hideousness of most of those names should be enough of a factor for remaining in the union . 
  his religious beliefs and the way he flaunts them seem to be triggering french people 's * la\u00efcit\u00e9 * ^ ^ tm , though . 
  that 's good news , though . 
  the more of a russian puppet she shows herself to be , the fewer chances she 'll have at winning the presidency . 
  russophilia is n't really a fad in france . 
  i do n't think many swing voters will see this as a positive attribute for their future president . 
  even against the largest dog , a cat will always arch its back and bare its fangs . 
  may ca n't afford to appear defeated . 
  a certain degree of bravado is necessary in such cases . 
  [ it is ] ( https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/3b/8d/37/national-palace-of-culture.jpg ) if you look at it from the ground . 
  it looks more like a large shopping mall than a `` palace '' of culture . 
  is this why they export so many of them ? 
  demand must be pretty high ... 
  the arabs already beat us to it . 
  the czechs and the slovaks decided to join their powers in order to break free from their overlords ( austria and hungary , respectively ) and be independent . 
  they needed each other 's help to achieve that and each side greatly respected the other one considering them their greatest friend and ally . 
  it only made sense for their split to follow a peaceful way , though many from both sides did n't want the split to happen . 
  i 'm sure they must be proud of their aryan supremacy and all that jazz ... 
  applying for visa and residency between european states is relatively easy . 
  i 'm sure the uk and spain will work this out and make it even easier since it would be beneficial for both sides not to kick out anyone . 
  well ... after jersey , guernsey , the isle of man , bermuda , the british virgin islands and the cayman islands , it 's time for uk proper to be part of the tax haven list . 
  no need to keep beating around the bush . 
  it does n't . 
  calm your tits , dude . 
  op said * feasible * , not ethical . 
  it allegedly is to differentiate between great britain and little britain ( brittany ) , but i 'm sure there 's some ego involved in the naming . 
  if britain can officially call itself `` great '' , i do n't see why the eu ca n't do something similar . 
  seriously , when i first read it , i thought `` hunter 's love '' was some sort of shooting club . 
  i do n't know ... * brex-mex * has a nice ring to it as well . 
   that 's because a lot of maltese imigrated to corfu in wwii . 
  that 's partially true . 
  most maltese immigrants came to corfu during the 19th century . 
  they were brought over by the british , who - at the time - had control over both malta and the ionian islands . 
  many of those maltese people were of italian descent . 
   in fact it is the only county where roman catholicism is the major religion . 
  that 's wrong . 
  although it 's true that roman catholicism is more prevalent in corfu than other parts of greece ( with the exception of syros and a couple of other places ) , it still constitutes only ~ 5 % of corfu 's religious adherence . 
  was n't donald duck banned in finland ? 
  you mean istria , corsica , nizza and savoia , right ? 
  the real unnoticed giant in here is luxembourg . 
  or are you colour-blind ? 
  no , he 's sadly not well-known in greece . 
  trump 's hand is also at least half the size depicted . 
  my point is supported by a technicality , i admit it . 
  i 've never heard of such a thing before . 
  is it a thing in malta ? 
  if anything , i 'd expect rhodes to have that privilege , since both islands were ruled by the knights hospitaller at some point in their history . 
  technically speaking , corfu was never part of italy . 
  it was a protectorate of the uk from 1815 , a department of napoleonic france from 1797 , and part of the republic of venice before that . 
  actually , the * [ enetokratia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ionian_islands_under_venetian_rule ) * of the ionian islands ' history is n't considered nearly as horrible as the ottoman rule of greece to the east . 
  the vast majority of the most lauded greek poets , composers , other artists , and scientists of the 19th century came from the ionian islands , with corfu having a [ special place ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ionian_academy ) among them . 
  i feel like op might have pulled about half of these out of their ass . 
  or at least greatly exaggerate some minute opinions . 
  still funny , though !, 
  it 's called a ` moose ' in north-american english , but it 's mostly known as ` elk ' in european english . 
  google translate shows me it 's call ' \u043b\u043e\u0441\u044a\u0442 ' in bulgarian . 
  / u/thissit was joking . 
  elephants do n't live in sweden . 
  they prefer to summer in norway . 
  actually , poles have a pretty good r\u00e9sum\u00e9 when it comes to [ resisting disease ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_death ) . 
  that 's not [ what i thought ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/madagascar_plan ) you meant ... 
  i 'm halfway convinced that belgium was an early plan for a united europe disguising itself as a country that fares well in its dichotomy and diversity . 
  when the time is right and the fruits of federalism are ripe enough , flanders will be absorbed by the netherlands and wallonia by france ( germany will also get the german-speaking parts ) . 
  after that , brussels will go all d.c. and be our new , multicultural and multinational federal capital . 
  a guy named * waszczykowski * should know better not to fuck up names . 
   homosexuality is actually widespread in north africa . 
  it 's just not talked about . 
  homosexuality is widespread all over the world . 
  the amount of exposure it gets has to do with society and laws . 
  the more tolerant a country is with its lgbt community , the more prominent it will be in its society . 
   and why do you think morocco is the favorite holiday destination of european gays ? 
  i thought that was spain . 
  greece . 
  how to properly market tourism . 
  you guys have are an ancient nation with a very distinct and multi-faceted culture . 
  you could be one of the most attractive countries for cultural tourism , but you do n't even make it to the top 10 destinations in asia . 
  you have a lot to share with foreigners and can boost your economy with tourism while you 're at it . 
   how is your relationship with your family ? 
  great !, 
  family is very important here . 
   is the american culture of being independent from the family prevalent in europe ? 
  which countries follow it ? 
  more so in the north/west than the south/east , but it 's very common in here as well . 
  most people who live with their parents after 18 do it for financial reasons . 
  the ones who can afford to move out usually do it , but it 's not considered such an imperative decision here the way it is in , say , scandinavian countries . 
   do mothers nag you every week ? 
  if they have a reason ( they do n't have to , but they do it out of love , so they 're excused ) . 
  :p  how close are you with extended family ?
