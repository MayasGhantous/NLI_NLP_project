  personally , not much . 
  i 'm pretty close with my parents ' siblings and their children ( my uncles/aunts and first cousins ) , but beyond that , i 'm only somewhat close to a couple of them . 
  my parents have a total of over 50 first cousins combined , so i ca n't ( or want to ) be close to them and their families . 
  i do n't even know most of them . 
  in greece , we do n't really have a filter . 
  some people in some social situations may feel more inclined to avoid a certain personal subject , but - generally speaking - among friends and people you 're familiar with , no specific subject of discussion is a taboo . 
  greek here . 
  politiki kouzina ( eng : a touch of spice ) . 
  it largely takes place in mid-20th century istanbul , but it tackles issues of the greeks from the city and how they affected their lives in greece as well . 
  it 's considered one of the best greek films and it 's centered around food , which is a plus . 
  as a greek , i 'm in a dilemma here . 
  russians are culturally closer to us ( with orthodoxy and all ) , but usa 's subcultural reach is much more extended ( films , tv , other media ) and the day-to-day life of both nations is different enough to put them both around the same distance from us . 
  i 'd say , strictly on a cultural level : russia . 
  on a sociocultural level : the us . 
  populism is definitely an issue in politics here , but we 're in a very bad ` underdog ' place right now that it 's among the least of our worries . 
  what we need is a ruling government with a spine and a true vision to make things better . 
  whether or not we can get that is another issue . 
  i 've never heard of `` ayurveda '' , but yoga is seen as some sort of alternative way to exercise and strengthen your body . 
  yoga classes are very common in many gyms . 
  outside of that , it 's not unheard of , but not very common either . 
  personally , i prefer movement when i work out , which is why i 'd rather jog or go hiking , but i 've never tried yoga , so i ca n't discard it . 
  prostitution is also a factor . 
  it 's illegal and unregulated in russia , so it makes it worse . 
  i think it 's longer than three months . 
  easy there , sherlock !, 
  right back atcha !, 
  for the same reason there is n't one for the alands . 
  only independent countries have flag icons on the map . 
  if they added autonomous regions , the map would be too busy . 
  is this the reason why there 's india on the / r/europe map and a chakra wheel on the header ? 
  * verbosity intensifies *, 
  get a room , you two !, 
  i shiver at the thought of the german flag 's origin . 
   okay , if all languages have the same amount of snow/ice related words ... 
  i never said that . 
  i just said that most languages have different words for snow/ice and related phenomena . 
  finnish is an agglutinative language . 
  you can combine different words with extra suffixes and create new meanings out of them . 
  * h\u00f6tt\u00f6lumi * , for example means `` fluffy snow '' . 
  just because finnish combines it into one word instead of two does n't make it a different word . 
  nightstick and night stick , for example , are the same thing . 
  and your list with words that mean `` snow and snow alone '' is all wrong . 
  * huurre * means ` rime ' . 
  * nietos * means ` snow-drift ' . 
  snow-related and * only * snow is n't the same thing . 
  greek , for example , has the word * \u03c7\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd\u03cc\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf * which means ` sleet ' . 
  it 's also one compound word , a combination of the words for snow and water , but this does n't make it a different word for snow . 
  just a new word for something related to snow . 
  not the same thing .

  question ( s ) for paris residents : is public transport in paris good enough to make someone not need a car ? 
  say , for someone living on the outskirts and having to commute to the city centre everyday for work . 
  is a car necessary ? 
  is it cheaper ? 
  faster ? 
  more comfortable to have one or does lack of parking space and heavy traffic make it worse ? 
  is the public transport system good enough to make owning a personal vehicle unnecessary for most parisians ? 
  senegalese immigrants usually head for france or belgium , since they already speak the language . 
  username checks out !, 
  they do n't all mean * snow * , though . 
  most languages have different words for semi-related weather precipitations and other phenomena . 
  the same is true for those `` hundred words for snow '' in the eskimo languages . 
  no more than 3 or 4 of those mean * just * snow . 
  same with finnish . 
  germany might not be on top of this , but it scored [ some ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/german_colonial.png ) pretty good points before wwi . 
  meanwhile , the tax and fee increases planned for 2017 are going to be even more severe , so i expect the `` economic growth '' and budget surplus of this year to be even greater . 
  and yet he 's still more english than the queen . 
  i love ( sorry , i meant * ajlaw * ) how many different associations the word `` kurwa '' has for polish people . 
  that was the loudest `` whisper '' i 've ever heard . 
  til there 's such a thing as the ` winter cream ' . 
  because when you break it down to syllables , < oe  counts as two syllables ( * soeta * -  ** so.e ** . ta ) , while < y\u00f6  , < \u00e4i  , etc count as one syllable ( * sy\u00f6d\u00e4 * -  ** sy\u00f6 ** . d\u00e4 ; * s\u00e4il\u00f6\u00e4 * -  ** s\u00e4i ** . l\u00f6.\u00e4 ) . 
  yeah , the lack of long vowels is a mistake . 
  as i said , there are lots of mistakes for multiple languages on the board . 
  i think it counts japanese < ei  and < ou  as the two diphthongs , even though nowadays most people pronounce them as long monophthong < \u0113  and < \u014d  respectively . 
  there are quite a few mistakes all over the post , as others pointed out . 
  no need for propaganda when you have working ears . 
  * patiently waits 582 years until next video *, 
  they would , but they 're being audited right now . 
  most people outside english speaking countries do n't learn the language so much through school , as they do through exposure to english speaking - mostly american - media ( internet , tv shows , cinema , etc ) . 
  exposure to irish is low even in ireland . 
  we 're currently having colder weather in central and eastern europe due to northerly winds , while the western parts of the continent are significantly warmer . 
  today 's temperature in london and dublin was ~ 10c higher than it was in athens and istanbul . 
  nonsense . 
  this is a packet sold in the republic of ireland , not the uk . 
  the roi has every right to put its national language on anything it wants ( items for sale , road signs , newspapers , etc ) . 
  do n't use the `` british isles '' as anything other than a geographical term . 
  there are two politically distinct , independent nations among them . 
  * `` giving up smoking reduces the risk of fatal heart and lung diseases '' *, 
   will the prosperous nation remain prosperous outside of the eu , though ? 
  the eu is n't kicking anyone out . 
  it 's not like a bunch of eu member-states will agree to a common constitution and the ones that do n't will be thrown out the union . 
  plus , the main bearers of the union ( namely , germany and france ) wo n't give up their sovereignty and willingly place themselves under the same umbrella with weaker states . 
  yes , but catalan is already a multidialect language is n't it ? 
  i have a friend from palma de mallorca , who differentiates between ` b ' and ` v ' when speaking catalan , while his college friends in barcelona do n't make that distinction . 
  it 's just that , to me , valencian sounds closer to castilian in pronunciation than any other catalan variant i 'm familiar with . 
  i have n't heard all of them , though , so i may be wrong about it . 
  to my ears , from the relatively little i 've heard , valencian is catalan spoken with a ( mostly ) castilian accent . 
  i mean ... during the unending eons in the sea of history , brexit is just a teeny tiny drop of meaningless backwater . 
  so , why hurry ?
