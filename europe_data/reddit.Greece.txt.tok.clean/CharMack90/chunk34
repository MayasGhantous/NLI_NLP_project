  let 's just enjoy the ride ... 
  i think because it 's supposed to be a relatively small and quiet city . 
  the internet , maybe ? 
  we do n't live in the 40s anymore . 
  * when you do n't have a strong-enough connection with a country and you 're grasping at straws : * `` hey , remember about 4,500 years ago when we were sort of the same nation ? '', 
  it 's pure racism . 
  nothing else to it . 
  maybe a joint capital then ? 
  there are many countries with two capital cities and a separation of powers between the north and the south seems more balancing . 
  hey , that 's our meme !, 
  even if their state governments were to stay with the same amount of power and authority , many austrians would be against having their federal government in berlin . 
  the lure of the illegal . 
   dimitris ( jim ) - vassilis ( bill ) these `` translations '' are quite a stretch , do n't you think ? 
   just like almost everyone in the netherlands speaks both dutch and english , so can the irish speak both irish and english . 
  difference is that the dutch use dutch to talk to each other and english to talk to everyone else , while the irish use english for both instances . 
  the fact that english is a widely-spoken , international language is a boon for the irish , but a bane for the irish gaelic language . 
  if you do n't * have to * use a certain language to communicate with a specific group of people , it 's much harder to acquire that language and keep up the fluency . 
  good thing germans are already halfway there , then . 
  i feel like this is a big city vs small town mentality , though . 
  i 'm sure smaller rural areas in germany have lots of warm and helpful people like that too . 
  most greeks are okay with the name . 
  it 's the cultural appropriation and spread of historical inaccuracies that is annoying and insulting . 
  the country even claims that alexander the great was macedonian and not greek , fully appropriating him into their ( obviously slavic ) culture . 
  this is like saying that george washington was virginian and not american . 
  or that winston churchill was english , not british . 
  their actions are a direct attack against part of our history . 
  they can keep the name as long as they do n't steal off other things attached to it . 
  it 's sad ( but understandable ) how english influences gaelic pronunciation . 
  most gaelic speakers pronounce the sound ` r ' the english way and it really rubs me the wrong way . 
  next time a notherner accuses the southerners of being lazy , i 'm slapping them in the face with surstr\u00f6mming . 
  edit : * joke disclaimer *, 
  * something something g\u00f6tterfunken ... *, 
  it 's nice to have happy , everyday-moment news from turkey in this sub . 
  it 's because accepting kosovo 's independence undermines serbia 's territorial integrity . 
  who 's to say that another region ( like vojvodina ) wo n't get any ideas in the future ? 
  that 's the reason russia would n't let chechnya go on its own merry way back in the 90s . 
  even though chechnya is a tiny region of little importance to russia , if they had allowed it to gain independence , it could be used as a valid excuse for other separatist movements in the country . 
  also , kosovo is rich in [ natural resources ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_kosovo#natural_resources ) ( especially lignite ) and serbia would n't let such profit go without any quarrel . 
  can you link a picture that does n't automatically download ? 
  i know time travelling is your thing , but fast forward at least a couple of millennia wo n't you ?

  that 's right . 
  gray and/or green eyes are much less common than blue eyes . 
  there 's also honour and integrity , but those terms are n't part of the politics vocab . 
  not if a foreign country 's army invades and forces a peaceful referendum . 
  i mean ... 
  i do n't want to undermine ukraine 's plight , but , if putin was willing to transfer a couple million shlim-shlams in my bank account , i 'd be trotting to the tune of yablochko right in the middle of simferopol for 24 hours straight . 
  now picture what a shameless , unscrupulous , power-hungry politician would do for it . 
  ca n't really blame her . 
  as well as nice , savoy , and corsica for italy . 
  and roussillon for spain . 
  and r\u00e9union for mauritius ... 
  [ wallachia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/mihai_1600.png ) as well . 
  worse - the etruscans stole and renamed them and you stole them from them . 
  italians excel in all kinds of crime ; even linguistic !, 
  ^ kidding ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ send ^ ^ mafia ^ ^ ^ per ^ ^ ^ favore, 
  that would happen if those people were properly assimilated instead of getting ghettofied ( whether that 's by their own volition or failure of the state to achieve it ) . 
  the mothers are part of the problem . 
  or , rather , the mentality they organically adopt while being part of that culture . 
  they raise their sons to be like their fathers , because that 's how it was always done and that 's the only thing they know . 
  they actually hate the term ` daesh ' . 
  they even flog people among their ranks who dared to use it . 
  avignon papacy = best papacy, 
  i think they meant where this `` totten '' place is . 
  no , i meant that i 'd prefer something like the roman empire rather than the holy roman empire . 
  i was mostly joking . 
  an increased centralisation of the government and its powers is what increases efficiency . 
  which is also one of the main problems member-states have with the union . 
  there are even native belgians who believe brussels has too much authority over the union . 
  people want the eu to work more efficiently , but refuse to allow it to have the power it needs to achieve it . 
  drop the `` holy '' part and then we can discuss it ...

  is life in dubrovnik significantly different from the rest of croatia ? 
  but no frisia . 
  both frieslands are actually in germany , so no extra beef is needed . 
  i love the ( failed ) attempt at keeping the metre while having to say mouthfuls like `` santiago de compostela '' and `` santa cruz de tenerife and las palmas '' . 
   5 % of inhabitants of luxembourg claim to speak and understand spanish , making it the highest penetration of spanish speakers in europe outside spain . 
  after andorra ( ~ 35 % ) . 
  that 's belarus . 
  it 's actually an [ x-post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/5l4tct/every_countrys_top_tourist_attraction_6000x3490/ ) from / r/mapporn . 
  i just used the website 's part about europe , but certain information was cropped out . 
  my bad !, 
  i believe it means the one in krakow . 
  and yes , these come from the visitors , so some of these may not be valid ( like , i 'm pretty sure the british museum comes first in the uk ) . 
  ** not present on the map : ** - * gullfoss * ( iceland ) - * church of the saviour on spilled blood * ( russia ) - * walled city of mdina * ( malta ) - * fig tree bay * ( cyprus ) - * hagia sophia museum * ( turkey ) - * old city of baku * ( azerbaijan ) - * gergeti trinity church * ( georgia ) - * geghard monastery * ( armenia ), 
  worse for le pen , that 's for sure ... 
  they also constitute only about 1/5 of the total population of france , it 's worse than it looks voting-wise . 
  i understand the uk , greece and italy , but what 's up with finland ? 
  why so eurosceptic ? 
  * everyone * picks up more english from the internet than from the schooling system . 
  ok , * now * we 're talking ... 
  among them , yes . 
  yeah , he 's as `` greek '' as any other royal before him . 
  there 's not a drop of greek blood in him . 
  plus , most greek people are n't even aware that he 's part of the family that once ruled the kingdom of greece . 
  we feel neither love nor hatred for british ( or any other ) royalty , that 's my point . 
  [ how about this ?

  what . 
  i think he 's canadian .
