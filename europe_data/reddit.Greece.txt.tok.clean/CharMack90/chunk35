  yeah , but all of russia is included in / r/europe . 
  why rebuild it ? 
  it looks [ beautiful ] ( http://topholidays.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/old-town-hall.jpg ) just the way it is . 
  edit : oh , i suppose you mean [ this ] ( http://www.ww2inprague.com/_/rsrc/1321835323230/before-and-after/radnice%20siroka%20ram10%20900.png ) ? 
  i did n't even know it was originally this big . 
  grass is always greener on the other side of the fence . 
  we used to celebrate christmas on january 7 until 1923 . 
  the few greeks who still do are the ones we call '' \u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 '' . 
  the ussr government was especially racist [ during the 40s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/population_transfer_in_the_soviet_union ) . 
  finland obliterates the netherlands ( 7/7 ) . 
  and inaccurate . 
  seems like these ratings were pulled out of the aether . 
  he has videos for these two as well . 
  [ 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbvrncwxzxu ) [ 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtbhvy2axn0 ), 
  difference is that bessarabia was never part of romania , apart from a short period of time between wwi and wwii . 
  before that it was an autonomous principality that was annexed by the russian empire over a century before the soviets acquired east germany . 
  the romania-moldova situation is closer to the croatia-serbia situation than the west germany-east germany one . 
  yeah , but i 'd assume that `` opening your presents '' and `` having your main festive meal '' would be things you 'd do with your family . 
   most germans celebrating christmas open their presents and have their main festive meal on 24 december , rather than christmas day . 
  then what sort of traditions do they have on christmas day ? 
  it 's a clash between the right to self-determination and abiding by the constitution . 
  you ca n't have both in all cases . 
   if so , what 's the point of the president ? 
  turkey is a parliamentary republic ( like germany , italy , greece , finland , et al ) . 
  this means that the * head of state * is a figurehead without any real political power , like the king/queen is in parliamentary monarchies ( uk , spain , the netherlands , sweden , et al ) . 
  this usually happens in countries that used to have a monarch as a * head of state * , but do not anymore , so they substituted him/her with a `` president of the republic '' . 
  this means that the * head of government * with the actual political power is the `` prime minister '' ( also called by other names like premier , chancellor , etc depending on the country ) . 
  there was a [ dutch reporter ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36124329 ) detained because of a tweet criticising erdogan , but that was before the coup attempt . 
  that 's north korea level of policing , right there . 
  unlike the chavs and the scallies of the south , who speak the purest of queen 's english , right ? 
  rightful hungarian clay . 
  still better than the venetian woman , who looks like an old bearded wizard . 
  there was also gift exchanging and playing games and sports . 
  furthermore , it occured among several regiments and extended past the yuletide . 
  many tried to do it next year as well , but their commanders would n't allow it , and - by that point - the war had gone ugly enough to kill the spirit for most . 
  it 's based on [ real ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christmas_truce ) events . 
  please * do * start another hype train with every fraction of population . 
  `` germanic '' only refers to the language sub-family . 
   german and ~ ~ dutch ~ ~ swamp-german ftfy, 
  phew !, 
  we barely dodged that one , did n't we ? 
  it looks like a closed bay from this perspective , but the left part of it past the trees ( not pictured ) is open to the sea . 
  the bridge actually connects the mainland with a small island . 
  checkmate , atheists !, 
  problem is that no choice we had so far was a good one . 
  both pasok and new democracy ( the two on-and-off ruling parties since 1974 ) ruined the country . 
  syriza was voted on the premise of `` hope '' and the possibility of some fresh minds in the governing position . 
  they even openly declared themselves as the only capable of bringing change . 
  but that was all horse-shit . 
  many mps of pasok left for syriza as their party was sinking and the syriza-anel coalition government proved itself to be very incompetent , getting where they are on empty rhetoric and populist remarks . 
  same criminals and morons wearing a different outfit . 
  the only way to keep our democratic regime is to be in a constant loop of incompetent and lackluster governments until someone able to fix this shit comes along and we ( through some sort of what i assume could only be divine intervention ) decide to vote for them . 
  well , whenever next election comes , syriza wo n't be getting the plurality of votes ; that 's for sure . 
  the traffic is bad , but the driving attitude is even worse . 
  fixed . 
  is this the one daniel craig and liam neeson ran on ? 
  technically it means neither . 
  it 's an ancient word ( of ~ ~ nordic ~ ~ norse origin ) from which both * ruthenia * and * russia * originate . 
  edit : word, 
  which is one of the main reasons organisations ( like the council of europe ) exist in the first place . 
  to make sure something like this does n't happen ever again . 
   * ... but mostly because they did n't want to die . 
  * ca n't argue with that . 
  but it * does * have a common currency and full fiscal union . 
  that 's a very chic christmas tree . 
  not monstrously big , not overly decorated , and it fits well with its surroundings . 
  it 's also nice that it 's an actual tree and not some post-modern tree-like construct . 
  like the us , only better . 
  oh , so it was the opposite of what i said . 
  seems like everyone but the vorarlbergians was against that union . 
  did n't vorarlberg have a chance to join switzerland but chose to remain with austria instead ? 
  that france-romandy extended border is / r/mapporn . 
  has anyone done cyprus yet ? 
  that 'd be another shitfest ... 
  fair enough . 
  though , if obama was a full-blooded native american (  1 % of the total population ) it would be more fun at least . 
  you ca n't really blame a country for ethnic oppression when its president * and * prime minister come from the 0.5 % of the lot . 
  so , a ` barack * hussein * obama ' deal then . 
  my favourite part was when many british indians and british pakistanis would complain about the increase of poles and romanians in the uk . 
  i assume aldi nord did n't include east germany before 1990 , right ? 
  yeah , but the echr extends past the eu boundaries . 
  the uk was a founding state of the very council that laid down these laws . 
  the fact that it will be leaving the union does n't mean it will also be giving up the laws of the echr treaty . 
  * is * it the `` vast majority '' , though ? 
  i 'd like to check out a list if convenient . 
  * one way to unite turkey ... as well as half of europe against it . 
  i wish this map was a bit more internationally friendly . 
  things like sfintisori , palinca , tuica , mona , manele , etc mean nothing to most non-romanians without an explanation . 
  so , it tastes bad until you trick your brain to simply get used to it . 
  worth it !, 
  at least it 's coloured as a portuguese dialect . 
  no matter our preferences , we 're all adults here ; can we stop pretending beer tastes good ? 
  this is just so they can make you swear allegiance to their queen . 
  technically , you 're both mostly atheist . 
  ... and iceland . 
  as you should . 
   i 'm glad europe 's full of cheese-makers and cheese-eaters . 
  i hear some poor folks in asia ca n't even properly digest it . 
  such a shame ... 
  they 're not wrong .
