  there 's a lot of life growing on french cheese . 
  you 're just jelly because our one cheesly majesty beats all your two-hundred-whatsit peasants . 
  well , for once , it 's a pastry - not bread . 
  so , using the word `` pain '' to refer to it is intrinsically wrong . 
  de gaulle seemed to be under the impression that governing and cheese-making were somehow interconnected . 
  seems like i was a bit wrong . 
  the adrianople vilayet ( more-or-less east thrace minus istanbul region ) had slightly more turks than greeks during the 1910s . 
  the orthodox population of the region , though ( greeks and bulgarians ) were the defining majority , and i would n't put it past the allied powers and greece to force a population exchange ( like the one that happened during 1923 ) to make sure the muslim population left east thrace and ionia . 
  in any case , it 's all theory . 
  no one could tell for sure if any of these predicitons would have worked out or not . 
   i do n't think edirne or trebizond were majority greek or armenian , especially after 1915 . 
  the cities were not , but the regions ( as they were carved ) were . 
  racism based on skin colour is largely an american thing . 
  over here in europe , we were racists centuries before any non-white people moved to the continent . 
  religion , ethnicity , political ideology , socioeconomic status , etc were seen as valid reasons for bigotry and animosity long before skin colour entered the mix . 
  `` white '' guilt , may not be the correct term , though . 
  political culture is very different between the two countries . 
  i assume the division ( if it went through and turkey had n't successfully revolted ) would end up being akin to the occupation zones of germany after wwii . 
  most of this area would be given back to a unified turkish state ( a very allied-friendly form , obviously ) and probably only the greek and armenian zones would stay as they were since the majority of the population there was greek/armenian at the time . 
  a kurdish state and an independent or autonomous straits region would n't be out of the question either . 
  may i ask why saarland is the butt of the joke among germans ? 
  any specific stereotypes and whatnot from that area ? 
  in mass , i assume . 
  cheeky . 
  i like how ` mountains ' is basically ex-sudetenland . 
  they both start with * `` sw - '' * . 
  that 's literally all there is to it . 
  the shooter specifically mentioned syria and aleppo . 
  if this is n't an isis hit , i do n't know what else it could possibly be . 
  interpreting it in different ways will be difficult considering there are eye-witnesses and a video of the shooting . 
  you do n't need to get outside europe to get more examples like this one . 
  - the czech republic ( aka czechia ) takes its name from * \u010cechy * , which is the czech name for [ bohemia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bohemia ) , czechia 's largest , most populated and most well-known region . 
  - the name of * italy * originally only referred to the peninsula , but since the creation of the italian kingdom , the term expanded to generally refer to sicily , sardinia , and the smaller italian islands as well . 
  there are many cases where either endonyms or exonyms will take part of the country and refer to the whole of it or even the other way around ( america -  usa ) . 
  yeah , by about 7 metres . 
  it 'd be a shame if someone where to ... blow it up ... 
  well , that is [ technically correct ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hou0lu8wmgo ) . 
  * 8 reasons why americans hate brexit . 
  number 6 will shock you !, 
  fair point . 
  i actually think that the romans were more into it that the ancient greeks were . 
  does it make it any less relevant ? 
  the uk as a whole * barely * voted to leave the eu and they have to go with it as much as they would have if brexit had won by a landslide . 
  percentages do n't matter in a `` first-gets-all '' type of voting system . 
  romans were really into butt sex , were n't they ? 
  even if we dismiss the ottoman empire 's cizye tax , it still has to do with democracy ` back then ' vs ` nowadays ' . 
  the new secular turkish republic , which had a fully functioning democratic parliament , enforced the [ capital tax ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/varl%c4%b1k_vergisi ) which brought christians and jews in turkey to their knees and ruined their lives , even amongst international outcry . 
  no democratic country could do such a thing in the 21st century . 
  that 's because non-muslims had to pay extra tax to be allowed to reside in the ottoman empire . 
  no democratic state can legally enforce such an economic discrimination nowadays , so the intolerance starts to show more ( though that 's still arguable ) . 
  op meant the muslims in * western * thrace , which is part of greece . 
   he actually requested ~ ~ boys ~ ~ * goats * . 
  ftfy . 
  serbia also needs good relations and access to sea-ports as easy and hurdle-free as possible to export its products ( over $ 15 billion per year ) . 
  two out of three of its main ports-of-use ( thessaloniki , greece and constanza , romania ) are within eu-member states and its third one ( bar , montenegro ) is in a country with the best chance to be admitted to the eu , as of 2016 . 
  serbia is already a member of fta , but a full eu accession will give it even better mobility and boost the country 's economy . 
  serbian people are already pretty evenly divided when it comes to eu accession of their country , but only time can tell of what their sentiment will be in a decade from now ( as well as russia 's and the eu 's economic status at the time ) . 
   the ban on christmas probably violates art . 
  12 of the school 's founding charter ... 
  it also violates [ art . 
  24 ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/constitution_of_the_republic_of_turkey#24 ) of the turkish constitution . 
  i do n't know ... mixing up two countries seems less forgivable than mixing up two words - in a foreign language - that sound exactly the same . 
  english-native speakers have no excuse , though , and should immediately be ~ ~ executed ~ ~ scornfully corrected after making such mistakes . 
  wtf ?!, 
  :o i have no idea . 
  i have my flair and flag for this sub checked and all ... 
  it deactivated on its own . 
  it 's visible in some other posts in this sub , but not here . 
  it 's visible in this comment as well !, 
  what the hell is this nonsense ? 
  very * dark souls * - y. 
  i second this . 
  it was a great read . 
  keep at it , / u/hexalby . 
  i just hope the lithuanians make it on time this time around . 
  twenty eight member-states in this fucking union and only austria ( or , rather , one of its ministers ) dares to propose the most logical and empirically successful program for dealing with the migrant issue . 
  i know australia 's case is different ( with its lower amount of migrant cases and more remote location ) , but you 'd expect at least * some * member-states to support venturing out to something that 's more reasonable and could work better than this mess we have now . 
  relocation of migrants among eu states is pointless while schengen 's free movement area is in place . 
  the majority will funnel towards the richest states as they already do . 
  the current system is unpopular , inhumane , costly , enables smugglers and human traffickers , and does n't bring aid to the regions most affected . 
  when your house is on fire , you do n't start moving out your possessions and let the building burn down ; you put out the fucking fire !, 
   if that proposal becomes reality , the czech would have enough cuban rum for well over a century . 
  you underestimate their drinking habits . 
   the anglo-portuguese alliance between england/uk and portugal is the oldest alliance in the world which is still in force . 
  it was signed in 1373 and is in force until this day . 
  i 've heard of this one before , but is it true ? 
  did n't the iberian union make spain 's enemies ( mainly england ) also portugal 's enemies ? 
  does this mean that hiiumaa and saaremaa are finnish turds ? 
  they 're trying to sneak in the eu when no one 's watching . 
  not on my watch !, 
  no , it 's not . 
  the netherlands score higher than finland in both gdp and gdp per capita ( nominal and not ) . 
  what 's a railway ~ ~ worker ~ ~ ? 
  the city of london has a [ mayor ] ( http://www.medievalists.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/lm-jeffrey-evans.jpg ) too ( a * lord * mayor , mind you ) . 
   `` easterlings '' was a generic term for men who lived in the east of ~ ~ middle-earth ~ ~ europe , who mostly fought under ~ ~ morgoth ~ ~ lenin and ~ ~ sauron ~ ~ stalin , not directly but rather on behalf of their own lords . 
  works out just fine , either way . 
  surprised about sweden and belgium . 
  i 'd assume the percentage was higher . 
  senpai just wants you to notice him . 
  benelux should be in gmt as well .
