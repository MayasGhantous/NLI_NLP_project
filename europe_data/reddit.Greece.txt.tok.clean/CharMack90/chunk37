  i have a similar problem as well . 
  no matter how many articles i read and how much info is spat out about them , names like juncker , schulz , and tusk mean little to me because i can never remember who is the president of what and how much power and/or responsibility they hold in their respective positions . 
  is there some sort of mnemonic to help what with this issue ? 
  it may seem so , but so many countries went from no recognition to either same-sex partnership or even full marriage equality in just a few years . 
  it only takes a progressive government and such issues can make a u-turn seemingly overnight . 
  damn you , vandals !, 
  first , the sack of rome of 455 , then the vinicultural discharge of 2016 ... what 's next ? 
  it all started when the vile czechs annexed [ sudetenland ] ( http://historiana.eu/assets/uploads/i000000361.jpg ) from the innocent and peace-loving germans . 
  silesia will be next . 
  the blunder with russia was erdogan 's biggest mistake . 
  certain coastal cities in turkey ( like antalya ) are heavily dependent on russian tourists to make a living during holiday season . 
  the mid-july coup attempt obviously did n't help either . 
  not to mention that putin 's popularity in russia is much higher than erdogan 's in turkey . 
  that 's a big fat lie that was propagated for too long and many people still believe it 's true . 
  greece entered the ez legally . 
  the 2004 audit showed that the system used to measure the deficit was responsible for this issue . 
  check the [ wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_financial_audit,_2004#new_government_audit ) if you 're more interested in finding out what the problem was . 
   what can i do to contribute to lesser the climate changes ? 
  voting for someone who believes in the scientific consensus on climate change and vehemently supports climate protection would be a good start . 
  oddly enough , belarus is even more russophilic than russia . 
  no joke . 
  i prefer them as south serbia and south-south serbia . 
  yeah , i have it , and i think an austrian like / u/calapine would have it too . 
  ** gone ** rhymes with dawn , john , and yawn ( short `` o '' ) . 
  ** cone ** rhymes with loan , zone , and thrown ( long `` o '' ) . 
  * if only i could be so grossly incandescent ... *, 
  it 's only better on an international scale , because most countries drive on the right side and going between borders to another country is easier when you do n't have to worry about crashing into someone while taking a turn . 
  no , it 's not the legal predecessor , because the ottoman conquest broke the continuity of the state . 
  it is its * cultural * predecessor , though . 
  it 's similar to the visigothic kingdom being the cultural predecessor of spain , even though it was intercepted by the islamic conquest by the umayyad caliphate and the emirate of cordoba . 
  come to think of it , i 'm not sure how culturally connected the spaniards are to their islamic conquest and its culture , but modern greeks do n't consider the ottoman empire as part of their cultural or political history . 
  we go from the fall of constantinople ( 1453 ) to the greek war of independence ( 1821 ) and consider the years between these events as `` slavery '' ( harsh word , i know , but that 's what it 's historically referred as ) by the ottoman overlords . 
   the organisation was founded in 1472 to provide charitable loans ** to the ` poor or miserable ' ** . 
  so ... when do i take my share ? 
  ouch !, 
  wonderful new little channel . 
  i hope he gets to make dozens more of such videos . 
   [ ... ] the german national was arrested by greek police , who said they spotted him taking pictures of a greek military outpost while sitting in his parked car . 
  the police officers confiscated his camera and searched his vehicle , finding a pair of binoculars , various camera lenses and several memory sticks . 
  his camera contained photographs of greek military installations and government buildings on the island , which ** is located less than 3 miles off the turkish coast ** . 
  seems like he could have used any average telescope from turkish grounds and be safe from getting caught . 
  in any case , trying to appreciate the olympic games for its good sportsmanship and lofty athletic ideal is like appreciating eurovision for its musical excellence . 
  indeed we do . 
  it must be the vatican 's influence over laws concerning same-sex marriage and adoption . 
  ** important to note : ** this map only includes the rights of the lgbt community on a legal , national level . 
  it does n't include the general public 's opinions about the community in those countries . 
  `` i 'm quite good at bringing people together ... against me . '', 
  they did in what was at the time my country . 
  or , rather , its cultural and historical predecessor . 
  / u/shalaiyn 's comment above seems to illuminate the situation . 
  1713 - never forget . 
  constantinople was getting systematically sieged by literally every tribe in a 1000-km radius ( the arabs were especially bothersome during that period ) and christians fought over religious icons . 
  well , the fact that the francoist regime banned the use of the language just after the second republic made it official , certainly did n't help . 
  i assume the same feelings must exist among many basque people , galicians , etc as well . 
  it 's one thing to never have chocolate and not know what you 're missing , and a completely different thing to have a bite and then never be allowed to have another one ever again . 
  it 's like the governing party is actively trying to come up with different excuses to expand the purges to more professions . 
  and here i thought that detaining kindergarten teachers and midwives was the lowest they could go . 
  were they green olives , perchance ? 
  because black olives are harvested until well into the winter ( even up to early february sometimes ) . 
  all of the disputed islands are to the far eastern aegean . 
  most of them are a little more than a stone 's throw away from turkish shores . 
  where 's the * ` meh ' * option ? 
  turkish politicians need to learn that they can not dispute international treaties and defy sovereign borders of foreign nations every time they want to boost their popularity or distract their people away from internal issues . 
   some of them are ** hundred of kilometers ** away from the greek - turkey borders . 
  you seem to be under the idea that the aegean is much larger than it actually is . 
  well , the three main groups of people who perform adolescent circumcision are jews , muslims , and americans . 
  i understand the first two because of religion and culture . 
  why americans do it , on the other hand , i 've no idea . 
  maybe it 's another fahrenheit/imperial system hipster thing . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.chadder.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/lions-head-bath-mixer-filler-taps.jpg ) might explain it .

  this is freaking amazing !, 
  may the rest of us follow soon ... 
  he has too many fanboys who view him as a saviour because he built them roads and gave them jobs . 
  the next presidential election is in 2019 ( too late ) and unless the opposition party ( chp ) decides to grow a backbone and do something against erdogan 's megalomania , then it 's bad news for turkey . 
  yeah , `` my chancellor is n't authoritarian enough '' , does n't really work as a complaint anymore . 
  [ sweating profusely ... ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/countries_that_use_a_first_past_the_post_voting_system.png ), 
   * ... your mountains so lofty ... * wat . 
  well , romania and poland were under great soviet influence and the part of turkey that bordered the ussr was in asia , so / u/thalos3d is sort of correct . 
  no one ever thinks about the spanish inquisition . 
  or expects it ... 
  jewish people contributed heavily in the economical and social life of pre-ww2 thessaloniki . 
  many greeks from the city ( and other parts of the country ) tried to harbour jews away from the nazis during the occupation . 
  that being said , there 's a miniscule minority of jews in modern greece ( most who survived the war moved to israel ) , but antisemitism is punishable by law and such hostile sentiments are n't common at all , no matter what the graph says . 
  i 've never met anyone openly hostile to jews in greece . 
  why keep one in your house when the streets are full of them ? 
  are you allowed to ice-skate on it when it freezes over ? 
  yeah , the mountain is nice and all , but what are the three musketeers doing in the shot ? 
  that only works for opinion-piece titles . 
   in a provocative move , the turkish officers refer to kasos with its turkish name - \u00c7oban - hinting that the island is another one of their `` gray zones '' !, 
  let 's not take needless exaggeration into account here . 
  we also do n't refer to imbros and tenedos as ` g\u00f6k\u00e7eada ' and ` bozcaada ' , but use our own names for them . 
  does this mean we consider them `` gray zones '' and dispute their sovereignty ? 
  turkey ( mostly erdogan , really ) has done several provocative motions the last few months , but let 's not be ready to cry wolf and spread fear and misinformation at every opportunity . 
  they have , but it 's mostly the outcome of controlled reforestation . 
  this increases the amount of trees as a whole , but decreases the original mixed natural forests due to preferred monoculture of fast-growing trees ( like conifers ) . 
   the ~ ~ most ~ ~ only romantic german speaking city in the world . 
  ftfy . 
  * plot twist : * they meant the dutch .
