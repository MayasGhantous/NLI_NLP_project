  in conclusion , classical latin evolved into what the historians call vulgar latin , and from vulgar latin 's multiple dialects/variants arrived all different modern latin ( aka romance ) languages , including romanian . 
  romanian had considerable influence from its slavic neighbours , but this does n't make it any less romance than , say , french and its germanic and gaulish influences . 
   did you study latin at school ? 
  yes , alongside ancient greek at lyceum ( last three years of secondary education ) , during the `` humanities '' educational direction . 
  check [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apolytirion ) out if you 're more interested . 
   indo-european languages is a set of different languages , to which latin belongs . 
  the case system is also present in german that does n't derive from latin . 
  but romanian got it directly from latin . 
  the same way german got it from old germanic and russian got it from old east slavonic . 
  all of them are indo-european languages having a common ancient linguistic ancestor . 
   they derive from another language called vulgar . 
  vulgar * latin * . 
  which by itself comes from classical latin . 
  also , i 'd say romance languages like french and portuguese sound much less `` latin '' than romanian does . 
   the case system is of indo-european origin , not latin . 
  well , latin * is * an indo-european language . 
  plus , romanian 's case system came directly from latin . 
  latin had a total of six grammatical cases during the classical era . 
  modern romance languages developed into a more simplified and analytic form , getting rid of cases . 
  romanian is the only major romance language that still has ( most of ) them . 
  also , the fact that the pronunciation is slavic is n't fully true . 
  sounds like a blend of romance and slavic to my ear . 
  the occitan-catalan subfamily is a dialect continuum starting from western piedmont in italy and following the mediterranean coast all the way to northern murcia in spain , including large inland chunks of france and spain . 
  it 's hard to say where occitan ends and catalan begins . 
  not where i am . 
  damn !, 
  i 'm only about 300km south of that and the sun is shining today . 
  they have plans for an entirely [ new city center ] ( https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/guardian/pix/pictures/2015/7/23/1437668038015/4171f054-9e14-4d8a-8c28-562834e13cb0-2060x1236.jpeg?w=1920&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=a5b1391876d932b57eac03fa8cfde8d2 ) . 
  you can learn pretty much everything about the situation from [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkvqj05aspy ) short video . 
  username czechs out . 
   just ~ ~ checked ~ ~ czeched . 
  ftfy, 
  sadly not . 
  most of them refuse education and social integration even when it 's offered to them . 
  yes . 
  it 's one of the few of the city 's buildings that will be moved piece by piece instead of being demolished and rebuilt . 
  i still find it weird how they think it 's not gay if you do n't bottom . 
  look again . 
  you 're not first place . 
  camps * can * be safe , but australia 's refugee centers ' status in manus and nauru have been met with [ justifiable criticism ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/27/nauru-files-manus-island-close-the-camps-rallies-asylum-seeker ) from both the international community and australian citizens themselves . 
  differentiating between the two is the main issue , since many of them seem to seize the opportunity to kill one bird with one stone and apply for refugee status to a rich and more accommodating country ( like germany ) . 
  you mean this madness has spread elsewhere in ireland ? 
  i thought it was just a dublin thing . 
  the eu has a lot of good plans . 
  it 's in the implementation of such plans that things go awry . 
  lots of studio apartments are of that size . 
  thousands of twenty-somethings all over europe live in such apartments . 
  sadly , mongolia does n't have enough power or energy to reclaim tuva , let alone moscow . 
  it feels rather complicated , but if it works it stays , i guess . 
  btw , * church tax * ? 
  do signed in christians get to have part of their wages go to church ? 
  it 's about the lack of social integration and economic equality . 
  not much to do with a specific race or cultural background . 
  but it still has to do with the state/region and not the individual citizen involved , right ? 
  like , a certain christian holiday which applies to all of hamburg will not exempt any non-christians from the holiday and it will be a day-off for everyone in the city regardless of religion , correct ? 
  you made it sound like you have to register as a christian to have the right to have a day-off during christian holidays . 
  is that a thing in germany ? 
  do n't christian holidays apply all over germany ? 
  nordic countries actually have one of the healthiest rivalries in existence . 
  probably the side its entrance door is placed . 
  at least that 's how they do it in the netherlands/belgium border buildings . 
   i thought finland was the balls of scandinavia , sweden and norway being weird twin dicks . 
  does this make denmark the cumshot ? 
  [ * map of european countries where lions are endemic . 
  * ] ( http://www.drodd.com/images15/blank-map-of-europe5.png ), 
  okay , finland . 
  you win . 
  the picture was taken from the clock tower of the old town hall , right ? 
  the effects of being 90 years old do n't help either . 
  there was one about snowden as well a few months back . 
  a weird message appeared on his twitter and some people thought he was killed . 
  supposedly he 'd have that message automatically appear on his feed if he had spent more than a specific amount of time without checking in , meaning he could n't because he got whacked . 
  of course , it was all bullshit . 
  somebody caption this with `` you came to the wrong neighborhood , motherfucker '' . 
  like ... literally . 
  i 'd love to see londoners pretending to be sad about australians leaving their city . 
  the metropolitan city of milan has a population of about 3.2 million according 2015 estimation . 
  you must be thinking of milan 's greater urban area which includes multiple other cities in the region . 
  no , but rush hour on the streets is literal hell . 
  yes , it is . 
  the arabs renamed the city from kydonia to al-hanim ( the inn ) after conquering it . 
  chania comes from the arabic word for `` inn '' . 
  rethymnon is an ancient name probably coming from a non-greek language of the region , like carian or lydian . 
   `` here sneezed duck '' which is , incidentally , the most exciting thing to ever happen in h\u00e4rn\u00f6sand . 
  technically , it 's anti-propaganda propaganda . 
  with blackjack and hookers ? 
  fair point . 
  france has had a pretty aggressive `` speak french ! '', 
  policy for centuries now . 
  no matter how much pressure it gets from local communities and cultural organisations , the government still refuses to amend the constitution and allow other native languages to have an official standing alongside french in their respective regions ( breton and gallo in brittany , occitan and provencal in southern france , etc ) . 
  you do you , erdo ... just be ready to deal with the consequences as much as we will . 
  get comfy , this ~ ~ might take a while ~ ~ will never happen . 
  p.s : do n't worry , i got the / s. 
  * godwin 's law alert * and hitler was addressing to germans during the nuremberg rallies , not the international community . 
  that 's what most turks do n't get . 
  they keep saying that it 's all rhetoric , that we should n't worry , and that erdo 's words have no actual meaning outside turkey , but they do n't understand that you ca n't have a country 's president openly question international treaties and rile up feelings of hostility against neighbouring nations . 
  this is not some rando on the internet saying `` make turkey great again '' ; this is the head of state , ffs !, 
  yes , i got that you did n't make up the term . 
  i 'm just saying - once again - that its a weird name for it . 
  like the [ ` rape of the sabine women ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_rape_of_the_sabine_women ) , where `` rape '' actually refers to abduction .
