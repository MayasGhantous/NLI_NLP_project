   i think every child should learn chess in school ... 
  this is the case in the [ republic of kalmykia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalmykia ) , a federal subject of russia where its former president ( a multi-millionaire and a huge chess fan ) made chess compulsory in all primary schools , built an [ olympic-style village ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chess_city ) devoted to chess and spent millions to promote it . 
  its [ capital ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elista ) has also hosted the 1998 chess olympiad . 
  another fun fact about kalmykia : it 's the only place in europe where buddhism is the traditional religion and practiced by the plurality of its inhabitants . 
  now imagine a small port city where most of the current citizens lived through at least one world war and went through a high-class education of piano and yachting . 
  that 's your answer for monaco , / u/ave-nar . 
  purple and burgundy [ seem similar ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft5gpp4w1ca ) to you ? 
  well , seen as it literally translates to `` child marriage '' , i think that 's an odd name for what you wrote . 
  * paedogamophobia * - there , i coined it for you . 
   curiously enough , there 's a kind of tragic coincidence going on there , since the word 's second compound ( * - gamo - * ) comes from a root for both ` marriage ' * and * ` fucking ' . 
  it works both ways . 
  i reckon half a century * is * long ago when it comes to such matters . 
  name checks out . 
  good point . 
  i thought / u/rogue _ wine was referring to vit-c for some reason . 
  ** repudiate ** - * to reject the truth or validity of something ; to deny *, 
   i take vitamin pills , it kinda helps . 
  out of point , but , unless you have a diagnosed vitamin deficiency , keep in mind that you 're pissing out about 99 % of their content . 
  * 404 error : sun not found . 
   turkeys economy is based on consumption since we dont exactly produce anything . 
  you actually produce lots of agricultural products ( ranking first world-wide among many of them ) , as well as automotive and locomotive parts and steel-iron products . 
  not sure if it 's enough or not , though . 
  this problem could be dealt with through language , i believe . 
  russian , for example , has two words to refer to what english calls `` russian '' : \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 ( russkiy ) and \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f\u043d\u0438\u043d ( rossiyanin ) . 
  the first one refers to an ethnic russian , while the second one refers to a russian national ( of russian or non-russian descent ) . 
  first one is generally cultural while the second one is a strictly civil term . 
  if all languages had such official terms in common use like russian has , there would n't be such an issue with identity . 
  i would n't expect it to `` trickle down '' anywhere past the m25 motorway . 
  have you been to turku ? 
  except when it comes to [ written language ] ( http://static1.1.sqspcdn.com/static/f/875708/20208036/1347214240823/a+map+of+the+official+language+forms+mlform+of+norwegian+municipalities+as+of+2007..png?token=hh20ticn%2bpoaa0lpkpprwddww60%3d ) . 
   turkey fired 15,000 state employees , including soldiers , police officers , tax inspectors , and ** midwives ** in the latest round of purges since the failed coup of july 15 . 
  delivering vile gulenist babies , i 'm sure . 
  well , lisbon 's food is just as good as stockholm 's and athens ' food is as good as munich 's . 
  it 's right there on the map . 
  you ca n't disprove science . 
  so far , he proved he 's extremely fickle and inconsistent with his ideas about economy ( and everything else , really ) . 
  i expect him to be nothing more than a puppet of the republican government . 
   i could not but with hearty thanks to almighty god ** ejaculate ** my thanks to him . 
  - * diary of samuel pepys * ( 1666 )  so he sat as i dropped off to sleep , and so he sat when a ** sudden ejaculation ** caused me to wake up , and i found the summer sun shining into the apartment . 
  - * the adventures of sherlock holmes * ( 1891 )  `` we ca n't use magic ? '', 
  ron ** ejaculated loudly ** . 
  - * harry potter and the order of the phoenix * ( 2003 ) it also used to ( and occasionally still does ) mean a `` sudden exclamation , a throw or flight with sudden force '' . 
   `` we are used to such things in politics . 
  today one speaks this way , then this mistake is corrected . 
  we should not be deceived here , '' he said . 
  of course this quote comes from mister flip-flop himself . 
  to be fair , we 're still keep saying ` maybe ' to him . 
   turkey will built itself a bigger country with the help of allah , stated turkish president recep erdogan ... 
  friendly reminder that nato keeps nuclear weapons in their country . 
  not to mention having a member 's army illegally occupy half of another member 's land . 
  it 's also a matter of immigration . 
  an open eu to turkey would most likely result to massive immigration and major population imbalance inside the richer eu countries . 
  turks already constitute the largest ethnic minority in germany and are among the top five in france , austria , the netherlands , sweden and denmark . 
  immigration will make turkish presence in europe much higher if it becomes easier to be achieved . 
  turkey 's gdp per capita is only slightly higher than that of bulgaria 's . 
  bulgarians are already topping the immigration charts among eu nations . 
  think of what will be if the eu allowed a country 's citizens over 10 times in number than those of bulgaria 's to move , work , and settle anywhere inside the eu . 
  especially rich countries like germany that have had decades of issues with turkish immigration ( since the * gastarbeiter * program of the '60s ) and problems with integration , would much likely oppose turkey 's membership . 
  it 's not that easy . 
  it 's like your last name was already stalin and your nation 's most common first name was joseph . 
  yet so many kevins ... 
  the way the title is worded , it sounds like there 's a law forcing the german chancellor and the president of france to marry each other . 
  alternatively , i have another proposition : ** space battles ** . 
  think about it ... 
  hate to break it to ya bro , but russia is n't under communism anymore . 
  unless by `` pro-kremlin '' you mean `` we 're open to the idea of doing business with russia '' . 
   greece said it would veto all new accessions if cyprus was not admitted . 
  til . 
  you 're apparently correct . 
  oh , gim me a break !, 
  `` emotion '' is as foreign to international politics as it is in any other kind of politics . 
  they were n't morons , they were making an investment . 
  one that could end up as very lucrative to them if they managed to get hold of the situation before it got out of hand ( which it did ) . 
  and sweden agreed to financially helping out any eu member in trouble . 
  they were n't forced into it . 
  well , at least about [ 10 % of that money ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/29/where-did-the-greek-bailout-money-go ) does . 
  yet somehow greece gets 100 % of the blame for it . 
  then why did the other members agree to it ? 
  it 's not like greece had any power to influence or blackmail anyone into acceptance . 
  yeah , but only `` allah '' refers to the god of islam , right ? 
  not to me . 
  i 've seen spanish people going all the way from pale skin , fair hair and light-coloured eyes to dark olive skin , dark hair and brown eyes . 
  much like all other southern-europeans , really . 
  northern europeans seem to have more homogeneous appearances than southerners do . 
  no one can tell that for sure . 
  there are no written accounts about the region 's demographic history from the time of the arrival of turks in anatolia . 
  plus , a nation 's genetic makeup is n't neatly contained within boundaries , unless the area is remoted , hard to approach and not subjected to immigration and general population movement , none of which apply to modern turkey . 
  iceland is the best european country for such statistics and heavily favoured by scientists who study genetics . 
  turkish people do n't ever refer to god as `` tanr\u0131 '' , though , do they ? 
  not to mention that it takes the blame from the perpetrator and puts it on the victim , who somehow needs to be married to be `` absolved '' from the sin of getting raped !, 
  you 're absolutely right . 
  no matter how you put it , there 's nothing short of barbaric about this law . 
  the big difference , however , is that no nation uses the old testament as the foundation of its country 's laws . 
  personally , i find it more weird that you were named after a sea . 
  he obviously sold his father 's soul to satan . 
  probably . 
  the finnish name for swedes ( ruotsi ) seems to indicate that . 
  russian men are also nice , tall and ... well ... 
  okay i 'll give you this one . 
  they 're a healthy mix of anatolian , middle eastern , central asian and balkan stock .
