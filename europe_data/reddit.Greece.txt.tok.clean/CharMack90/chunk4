  the best kind of muslim . 
  actually ... the best kind of religious adherence of any kind * period * . 
  the guy who first proposed dst was an entomologist who enjoyed after-hour sunlight because he had more time to collect insects . 
  he even proposed a * two * hour shift every summer so he could have time to get all dem nicer bugs . 
  that 's all you need to know about the `` importance '' of dst . 
  it 's almost exactly the same place where the august 24 and october 26 earthquakes happened this year . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/london_bridge_ ( lake_havasu_city ), 
  what * is * a valid reason to ruin someone 's life then ? 
  it was also incredibly unfair . 
  - the amount of greeks who had to relocate from the new turkish republic to the kingdom of greece were almost three times as many as the turks leaving greece for turkey . 
  - most turks were notified much earlier and were allowed to pack up many of their belongings with them , whereas most greeks had to leave on short notice and , in most cases , were n't allowed to have any baggages with them ( my great-grandma left trabzon on a boat with her family having only a picture of a saint hidden in her bosom ) . 
  - the way the turkish officials and public treated the greeks was nothing short of inhumane . 
  while forced to leave their homeland , they were piled up in boats , forced to walk long distances and locked up in entry/exit points ( like the infamous selimiye barracks ) where they were stripped naked , stolen of every little possession they could bring with them and hosed down with cold water to `` clean them '' and make sure they had no diseases ( even though - i repeat - they were * leaving * turkey ) . 
  hundreds died of things like cholera or smallpox that they caught while detained inside the barracks . 
  eye-witnesses have even spoken of beatings , rapes , and affluent childless turkish families stealing newborn babies from mothers locked in the barracks waiting to be deported . 
  my great-grandma had two of her sisters die of pneumonia in there . 
  they were n't even allowed to bury them ; just threw them in the sea . 
  - finally , the way turkey treated the remaining greeks ( as agreed upon in the treaty of lausanne ) was a direct violation of the treaty itself . 
  things like the [ varl\u0131k vergisi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/varl%c4%b1k_vergisi ) and the staged [ september events ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/istanbul_pogrom ) drove ethnic greeks out of the country and dropped the population of greeks in modern turkey in the low thousands . 
  these are things that most turks do n't even now about and the government is n't planning to let them know any time soon . 
  the population exchange and the rest of the treaty of lausanne made it easier for the countries to fix their internal citizen issues , but it was n't easy at all for the people who had to go through with it . 
  silly ... we all know the netherlands belong to the sea . 
  well , the angles are the historical owners of ( continental ) denmark and they are the ancestors of modern englishmen , so ... yeah , prepare most of your country to be annexed by the uk , according to our new way of interpreting history , at least . 
  which makes it yet another reason to google the blue mosque . 
  more people already know what the hagia sophia is , so it is n't searched online as often . 
  important to note that the sultan ahmet mosque was built to mirror the hagia sophia and was intented to surpass it in its glory . 
  [ o_o ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/65/ca/ee/65caee454290c187d450821fb3daace2.jpg ), 
   the name `` constantinople '' has become a shibboleth for a certain type of irredentism , now popular among the alt right . 
  of which country ? 
  because that 's certainly not greece . 
  the city has been known as konstantinoupolis to us since constantine established it . 
  all greeks call it like that . 
  it 's like the italians calling nice `` nizza '' or the polish calling vilnius `` wilno '' . 
  these are not simply historical names . 
  these are cultural [ exonyms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exonym_and_endonym ) and there 's nothing wrong with using your language 's name for a place when you refer to it . 
  nothing 's `` alt-right '' about that . 
  okay . 
  to the melting pot it is !, 
  minus ireland ( or at least the republic ) . 
  if you choose to solve the successor issue according to the head of state , then scotland could potentially call itself the successor of the uk . 
  the unified realm came to be when a * scottish * king ( james stuart the vi and i ) rose up to the english throne to be the head of both countries . 
  and once the actual political union happened , it was queen anne ( another stuart ) who was the monarch . 
  it checks out . 
  that 's like the minimum amount of democracy needed to call the outcome fair . 
  it 's certainly valid , but it feels rather cheap and insulting to most spaniards . 
  that 's true . 
  this is one more of the cases where ez-wide laws should be implemented . 
  in all honesty , once a common currency is introduced , it 's simply idiotic not to pair it with a common fiscal policy and laws that directly regulate it in every ez country . 
  that 's what they do in the yellow countries on the map . 
  crazy , is n't it ? 
  exactly . 
  solidarity and goodwill are meaningless if there 's no binding law enforcing their ourcomes . 
  yeah , finding nemo is one of these movies that i like better in the greek version . 
  same goes for toy story , the incredibles and a few others . 
  it 's not a bad thing ; it 's just unfair for a supposed union of `` equality '' . 
  it 's like a bunch of people decided to run a marathon side-by-side . 
  some , though , started with aerodynamic athletic shoes , some with old runners , and some barefoot . 
  you can not possibly expect them to finish all together without some of them pushing harder than they 're physically capable of or others slowing down to let the weaker ones catch up . 
  it 's once again a matter of competitiveness and solidarity . 
  all of the eu/ez countries are too selfish and self-serving to fully accept this `` equal '' union and all that entails . 
  this does n't discredit / u/dysfunctionfornia 's point . 
  if that was the case , germany should have been bombarded by meteors several times by now . 
  there are a few mistakes and/or oversights in this one . 
  ukraine and belarus should be yellow . 
  cyprus is blue and moldova should be blue as well . 
  turkey and albania should be orange and lithuania should be yellow . 
  latvia is probably yellow too . 
  the voice-over thing is by far the worst one . 
  you get a few voice actors translating the lines on top of the original voices ( alongside the rest of the soundtrack ) . 
  it baffles me how people can actually watch anything and enjoy it this way . 
  that 's exactly what russia did in 2011 . 
   consequence - konsequenz  consistency - konsistenz german is n't trying hard enough . 
   libya is not at war you might wan na check that again . 
  federations have been doing that for centuries . 
  usa , brazil , mexico , even russia and germany have federative states that receive more funds while others provide more of them . 
  federalisation of europe is the only thing that could potentially hold us together , but that 's still too far away from happening ( if ever ) . 
  there 's also * skyrim remastered * . 
  in case of alien invasion , go home . 
  til, 
  and we do n't celebrate the fact that we entered the war , but the fact that we said `` fuck you '' to the ones who wanted us to surrender without a fight . 
  greece had no interest in taking part in the war before mussolini decided he wanted to expand further east . 
   i 'd argue that serbia has just as good relations with the eu , as it does with russia . 
  that 's the problem . 
  both blocks request ultimate loyalty or it 's a `` if you 're not with us , you 're against us '' mentality . 
  it 's cold war 2.0 , but serbia ca n't take yugoslavia 's neutral stance and piss off both sides again . 
  it 's forced to choose . 
  long story short : they joined their powers ( and grounds ) to push back inflluence and gain independence from their long time rulers ( austria for the czechs , hungary for the slovaks ) . 
  and every other day in between ... 
  most of southern/south-eastern europe [ is like this ] ( http://horizon-magazine.eu/sites/default/files/share-map.png ) . 
  i saw a couple of pics online and your variation is n't layered and does n't have b\u00e9chamel on it ( that 's a prerequisite in the greek version ) . 
  it 's quite a different dish . 
  you also seem to serve it with a side-dish , while ours is a whole dish by itself . 
  the aubergines and the minced meat are the only thing they have in common , really ... 
  you have it in turkey too ? 
  ( well , it has aubergines in it , so i assume you must have it ) . 
  molotov cocktails ? 
  saint petersburg ? 
  must have been the finnish . 
  why is it so sweet , though ? 
  is the sap naturally sweet or are a bunch of sugars and/or high fructose byproducts added to it to make it sweeter ( like the americans do with corn syrup ) ?
