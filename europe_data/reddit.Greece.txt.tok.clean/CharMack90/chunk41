  i 'm sure that the average russian could n't point north carolina on a map any more than the average american could point tatarstan . 
  this article takes some rare instances and ups them to 100 . 
  two older women talking about the american `` racial divide '' on a stroll ? 
  * seriously * ? 
  this might be the only good outcome out of trump 's election . 
  a good slap in the face of western governments and their current ruling tactics . 
  i only hope a new wave a populist politics does n't completely take over and we end up on the other side of the spectrum . 
  who has n't ? 
  napoleon iii also gave specific instructions to haussmann to make paris more open-spaced , livable and beautiful . 
  haussmann was heavily criticised back in his time and even years after his death , but today , his design for paris is venerated by both france and the rest of the world . 
  it 's as if communists were actively trying to be hated . 
  * german words used in ~ ~ american ~ ~ english, 
  alongside their hopes and dreams for a gdp increase . 
  greece : achieving cognitive dissonance as a governing system since 2015 . 
  they forgot to paint it in . 
  same with part of galicia . 
  i 'm pretty positive that most of those 46 % eligible voters who did n't vote are dems or dem-leaning , so i would n't be surprised if that was the case in california or any other dem-majority state . 
  sanders ' debacle also influenced a heck of a lot of his supporters who decided not to give their votes to clinton . 
  that 's very likely , yes . 
  five out of six of its largest cities voted more blue than red this election . 
  there was a larger percentage of democratic votes in austin ( the capital of texas ) , than sacramento ( the capital of california ) . 
  just let this sink in for a bit . 
  funnily enough , the main reason this happens is because of a large amount of californians moving to texas because of lower taxes and better job prospects . 
  this way the state becomes more progressive each passing year . 
  federations do n't usually work with a direct `` rule of the people '' kind of democracy , but an indirect representative one . 
  this ensures every federal state is been given equal voting power , even if it means one individual citizen 's vote is worth less than another 's . 
  in any case , hate the game , not the player . 
  if french and italian are at 0.89 , i assume french and catalan might be the same . 
  sounds better than * brexit * , though . 
  fabulous !, 
  too cold ? 
  * finland * ? 
  who would 've known !, 
  may said she will trigger art . 
  50 by march 2017 . 
  this sounds like a fairly reasonable waiting time to me . 
  i do n't understand all the bitching towards the uk when it comes to this event . 
  if q1 of 2017 comes and goes and art . 
  50 is still not triggered , * then * it 'd make sense to bitch . 
  no shit !, 
  maybe the eu will finally come up with a decent plan to deal with the immigrant/refugee crisis . 
  hands down , one of the most beautiful national assembly buildings in europe . 
  well , hard drugs are usually more harming and more addictive , but they cost more too . 
  yeah , it * is * funny how `` turkish genocide in greece '' does n't even hold results on google . 
  it 's almost as if such a thing never happened . 
  i 'd say overdramatic , but it 's better to be safe than sorry . 
  it seems especially odd because there 's more than enough atlantic on the map for iceland to be visible . 
   monrovia is named in honor of u.s. president james monroe , a prominent supporter of the colonization of liberia and the american colonization society . 
  ( from the wiki ) * really * not the same thing . 
  the article refers to [ this island ] ( https://www.google.gr/maps/place/%ce%a0%ce%ac%cf%83%ce%b1%cf%82+821+01/@38.505619,26.2360952,13z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x14bb7321f75fde73:0xc3233bd8b0e5e1d2!8m2!3d38.5038061!4d26.2833363 ) , also known as `` panagia '' . 
  liberia does n't appropriate american history . 
  it just has a tiny percentage of people of african-american heritage . 
   ou can claim `` we was here since ancient times '' without pissing anyone off . 
  except historians , that is . 
  i sincerely doubt it . 
  they 'd have to go full-dictatorship since they used military force to topple the previous regime . 
  democracy in turkey would be fully gone , instead of halfway gone . 
  we do n't really know who or why they conducted last year 's coup ( apart from toppling the government ) . 
  if we go by erdogan 's narrative that it was the gulenists , then akp 's islamism was fought with even harder islamism . 
  it 's the * moana - vaiana * debacle all over again !, 
  [ there already is .

  at least it has vowels . 
  this sentence could be either really good or really bad depending on whether you 're a casual tourist or an international assassin . 
  britain and ireland . 
  although the smaller islands are left out this way . 
  italy is like the entire eu in one country . 
  checks out !, 
  he should 've stayed there . 
  the place he got after his second exile was a [ definite downgrade ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/longwood_house ) . 
  op used a photo of the st andrews cathedral in [ singapore ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st_andrew%27s_cathedral,_singapore ) . 
  also the coup ex machina and the fear of terrorism in turkey 's case . 
  you guys really had some awful luck for democracy the last couple of years . 
   but ... toilet paper gets messy when is wet . 
  not the thick , better quality kind . 
  plus , you only need to pat your crack with it to absorb the moisture . 
  no need to get messy . 
   yeah ... i saw that in zakynthos . 
  why ca n't you throw toilet paper directly in the toilet ? 
  oh , i toss it in the toilet usually . 
  most people do that as well , unless they live in an old place with old pipes which get clogged over time . 
  \u266b expose your naked skin to the sun ( so hot ) let it burn under its hellish rays \u266b, 
  what kind of idiot sets fire to a volcano ? 
   but now it sounds/looks french , what the fuck . 
  * portesp\u00e9irance * ? 
  this is getting ridiculous . 
  foursomes are too complicated to be fun . 
  i 'd rather use toilet paper , toss it in the trash and be done with it . 
  what 's wrong with that ? 
   that sounds like a portuguese ... asking you to wait for something . 
  they 're asking you to wait for them before you start the threesome . 
  i prefer * esp\u00e9ire * , to keep it in its native languages . 
  `` personal towel '' ? 
  you mean you re-use it afterwards ? 
  it 's not just in bulgarian . 
  a quick search lets me know that polish and croatian are the only major slavic languages where europe is n't spelled e ** v ** ropa or the cyrillic equivalent . 
  if erdogan demonizes europe to control and unite his populace , how can we - being certified nazis - do any better ? 
  basically , yeah . 
  just sit/squat as close as possible to the faucet and clean your anus with the water coming out of it .
