  dry with toiler paper and you 're set . 
  just remember to pop the plug first unless you want a pool of poopwater in the bowl . 
  because most slavs pronounce europa as e ** v ** ropa . 
  it 's because of greek influence . 
  the letter `` u '' makes a / v / sound in the [ eu ] combination in greek . 
  exactly . 
  by that logic , no christian/muslim should call themselves christian/muslim because absolutely no one on this planet lives their everyday life according to the teachings of the bible/quran . 
  cherry-picking what to believe in and adhere to in a religious dogma is the norm , not the exception . 
  i think patriotism has a positive meaning , chauvinism a negative , while nationalism can have both . 
   my nation is the best , i should do ( almost ) everything to make my nation great that 's patriotism . 
  ( yet ), 
  is the discrimination towards specifically finnish , or any language that is n't swedish ? 
  i understand that the accusation comes from finnish researchers and activists , so they are going to focus on their side 's problem . 
  it 's important to note , however , if the discrimination is targeted on a specific group or all non-swedish speakers in general . 
  are arabic , polish , somali , etc speaking children exempt from this ? 
   why did they leave ? 
  was this after partition ? 
  for political and economic reasons . 
  it started after cyprus was handed from the ottoman empire to the british empire and became especially pronounced during the [ cyprus crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cyprus_crisis_ ( 1955 % e2 % 80 % 9364 \\ ) ) . 
   and what explains the increase of population ? 
  are they getting many immigrants ? 
  cyprus does n't have a very high inbound migration . 
  most of the population increase happened naturally with more births , like in malta 's case . 
  it 's probably just native increase along with some immigration from other places ( especially ex-soviet states ) . 
  not really . 
  the greeks vs turks of cyprus ratio has been about 4:1 for the last 50 + years . 
  the main demographic change comes from the great emigration of turkish cypriots ( mostly to the uk , us , and australia ) and immigration of anatolian turks to northern cyprus . 
  up to half of turks of cyprus are settlers from the mainland ( or descented from them ) , not native cypriots . 
  emigration of greek cypriots has also been extensive , but not to the point of decreasing their population on the island . 
  no , but i can see how it may seem so . 
  the agreed-upon general consensus is that france 's military history is comprised of an avalanche of cowardly acts , idiotic defeats , and countless surrenders due to her spineless people . 
  stop trying to change the opinion of the collective zeitgeist with your historical evidence and facts !, 
  / s edit : clarified sarcasm, 
  if we care enough for it , we will deal with it . 
  also , changing our `` social nets '' might actually be easier ( and better in the long run ) than somehow forcing people to have more children . 
   he knows nothing and does not want to know anything , since he does not believe that anything can be known tolstoy just plagiarized socrates and passed it off as a generalized christian idea of knowledge without even mentioning god . 
  kudos to him , really . 
  true , but there 's still no obligation for someone to bring a child into this world . 
  if anything , there are more people alive right now than in any other point in history . 
   to me , it feels really bombastic and ** gaudy ** ... hehe ... 
  till then , let 's allow madrid to protect animal abuse under the `` cultural heritage '' umbrella term and deny individual communities from banning it . 
  it 's not so much who would fight against him as it 's how it 'll affect him and his presidency if a civil war-like conflict was sparked under it . 
  it still is . 
  you can get anything from a slap on the wrist to capital punishment for it in many countries around the world . 
  we seem to forget that we are n't in a different place today than we were 50 years ago . 
  we just have one foot on better ground . 
  the other one is still in the murk . 
  in greek , apart from the actual word for `` no '' , we also have a similar way to express a negative response . 
  we make a / tsk / clicking sound with our tongue against the top of the mouth - like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-imfjwhdm0a ) , but only once - and swiftly raise our eyebrows . 
  it can also be combined with a side-to-side shaking of the head . 
  that 's a very extreme reaction , though . 
  there are multiple eu countries that are n't part of the ez . 
  also , most of the loaned money came from the imf which works on an international scale independently from the eu . 
   i would rather see the ** turkish turban ** in hagia sofia than the ** pope 's mitre/tiara ** . 
  ftfy . 
  `` turkish tiara '' got a chuckle out of me , though . 
  i imagined a princess ' silver tiara with little fez tassels hanging from it . 
   i wish countries like yours werent part of it fair enough . 
  you 're allowed to have an opinion . 
   hundreds of millions ( maybe even billions ) of hardworking taxpayer euro 's went your way and we 'll never see that back . 
  almost all of that bailout money went to repay international loans . 
  pretty much none of it `` went our way '' . 
  keep in mind , also , that during the referendum on july 5 , 2015 , 61 % of greek voters rejected asking for more bailout money , something that the syriza-anel ( current ) government did n't even bother with and went with receiving it anyway . 
  in any case , it 's the fact that we 're in the ez that forces the eurogroup to bail us out and any of our governments to comply with this , whether left or right , to not harm the euro . 
  our eu membership has little to do with it . 
  well , the eu is the closest we ever came to european solidarity and making europe a thing more than just a continent with semi-related history and culture between its people . 
  the european union is `` i love europe '' put to action . 
  it 's [ shannon estuary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shannon_estuary ) 79 . 
  eratosthenes calculated the circumference of the earth with remarkable accuracy over 1,600 years before columbus ' time . 
  his calculations and works on the subject are mentioned in many medieval writings . 
  at some point , we have to consider the possibility of columbus playing dumb or being dumb . 
  is there an anarchist precedent in hamburg ? 
  legit question . 
  the only clearly noticeable bias in this sub is pro-eu and pro-europeanism in general . 
  and people still complain about it forgetting this is / r/europe . 
  next up , people on / r/movies are biased towards films . 
  the horror !, 
  they 're speaking parseltongue . 
  sadly , that 's almost certainly a fictitious account . 
  well , the monkey was more specifically a [ barbary macaque ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barbary_macaque ) , so it was obviously an extremist islamic ploy to harm our hellenic magnificence by killing our god-sent orthodox king . 
  that 's not the preferred nomenclature . 
  we had a king who died of sepsis after a [ monkey bit him ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_of_greece ) . 
  but that still does n't even come close to [ pyrrhus of epirus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pyrrhus_of_epirus ) , one of the strongest opponents of the roman republic , who defeated countless armies and burned down countless cities , even coming to the doorstep of rome itself only to be killed after an old woman threw a rooftile on his head . 
  i like how azerbaijan is trying to surpass its currently tallest skyscraper ( 182 m ) by planning to build one [ over 800 m taller ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/azerbaijan_tower ) . 
  i refuse to be ruled by something that sounds like it belongs in a fast food menu !, 
  until the ` name the constituent states of the german empire ' question comes along and everyone starts panicking . 
   but how do you explain germany ? 
  they 're not hot . 
  just tepid . 
  does this also mean your neighbours are hotter than you ? 
  * we had growth ?!, 
  there are still more redheads as a percentage of the total population in ireland than in any other country . 
  who was a roman catholic ... aaand we 've gone full circle . 
  `` protestantism '' is often used to mean every christian denomination which broke out of catholicism because of conflicts with the papacy and/or the catholic dogma . 
  anglicanism technically fits the bill . 
   greek yogurt is an unhealthy sugary mess that jamie lee curtis eats to poop easier . 
  that 's activia , a french product . 
  actual greek yogurt is very healthy and the amount of sugar in it ranges by brand ( just like skyr ) , but it 's usually only at about 3 % . 
  now i want a picture of the queen harpooning a whale . 
  that 's the * most serene * republic of san marino , mind you .
