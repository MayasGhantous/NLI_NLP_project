  well , you 're not wrong ... 
  wifi 's shit . 
  ^ ^ does ^ ^ this ^ ^ help ? 
  well , warsaw is also by far the most populated city in poland . 
  high traffic and congestion would be a problem anyway , so you might as well make the streets wider ( or better yet , provide better public transport options ) . 
   this is why warsaw 's streets are wider than normal for poland/europe , for example . 
  well , at least that 's a plus . 
  also , the [ old town ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/plac_zamkowy_w_warszawie_widziany_z_wie%c5%bcy_ko%c5%9bcio%c5%82a_%c5%9bw._anny.jpg/1280px-plac_zamkowy_w_warszawie_widziany_z_wie%c5%bcy_ko%c5%9bcio%c5%82a_%c5%9bw._anny.jpg ) was rebuild as it was , so some of the city 's historic character is still evident in its architecture . 
  * what do you want from me ?!, 
  it 's actually about the same . 
  there are ~ 10 million muslims in european turkey and another ~ 10 million in all of russia , but fewer than that if we only include the european part of russia . 
  it looks like the downtown area of almost every large us city , somehow . 
   it just looks like they are being a jerk and stealing all of b&h 's coastline . 
  * croatia - the chile of the adriatic . 
   like zootopia to zoomania for no apparent reason . 
  it was * zootropolis * actually . 
  the reason it was changed in europe was because of a copyright issue with the original name . 
  same thing with * moana * becoming * vaiana * across the pond . 
  lots of times the name change will come directly from the american company which licensed and distributed the film . 
  happy statehood day , croatia and slovenia !, 
  name a more iconic duo ; i 'll wait . 
  * `` furthermore , the victim was found naked in a bathroom closet with all faucets leaking and coins scattered on the floor . 
  i 'd prefer bosno-herzegovinian convertible marks . 
  `` sodomy '' can refer to any non-heterosexual , non-procreative kind of sex , though . 
  this makes any law against it quite extreme , do n't you think ? 
  vmro-dpmne supporters in fyrom come to mind . 
  no reason to exist if you ca n't deus vult anymore . 
  well , french is kinda odd when it comes to suggestive words . 
  calling a man `` good '' means the man is good . 
  calling a woman `` good '' means the woman is sexy . 
  i get what you 're saying , but / u/latvianlion has a point too . 
  you can find as much justification for lynching non-heterosexuals in the bible as you can in the quran . 
  it 's the current age 's cultural and social understanding of any religious scripture ( or lack thereof ) that leads to intolerance and extremism . 
  for example , there was a point in time ( during part of the middle ages in iberia ) where christians would `` throw gays off buildings '' , while al-andalus officials and governing members would only feel `` meh '' towards its presence . 
  some of the most lauded pieces of islamic art ( mainly paintings and poems ) of that time would depict and/or explore homosexual relationships ( almost exclusively between men , though ) while the persecutions in christian europe would be worse than nightmare for homosexuals . 
  there is historical precedent for this . 
  it 's the current age , emphasizing human rights and tolerance in most ( but not all ) majority-christian countries , that led to less extreme views on lgbt people . 
  if anything , non-religious individuals are more likely to be tolerant . 
  modern muslims are more likely to be extremified than non-muslims , that 's true , but this was n't always the case . 
  hardcore conservative views on their religion and culture is the main cause of the problem ; not the religion per se . 
  you filthy eurosluts !, 
  i like the estonian one . 
  yeah , but she goes by `` betty '' ... which makes as much sense in greek as it does in english . 
   do you check people 's cocks ? 
  you do n't ? 
  they 're messing with us themselves , though . 
  the slovak and the slovene languages are called * sloven\u010dina * and * sloven\u0161\u010dina * respectively in each language . 
   actually slavo-macedonia is something that many greeks ( but not all ) consider a fair compromise . 
  the 25-30 % of ethnic albanians in fyrom are the main problem with this name , not greece . 
   why would a major bank be `` cancer '' ? 
  not * any * major bank , but the banking company which is one of the main perpetrators of the 2007-2008 crisis can certainly be dubbed as `` cancer '' . 
   the area predicted was about * 17000 hectares * for comparison , this is slightly larger than liechtenstein . 
  `` took a bunch of children '' [ like this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stolen_generations ) ? 
  he would if those damn tories had n't supported angela . 
  9.5 / 10 - great job !, 
  it will also be red , white , and blue , do n't forget about that . 
  jeez , that came out of nowhere , did n't it ? 
  probably `` peder '' . 
  better late than never , i guess . 
  i 've been corrected when it comes to the use of linguistic markers a bunch of times already , but i never seem to remember what to use . 
  thanks for trying , though . 
  not with that attitude !, 
  fair point . 
  did n't think putin needed a re-election campaign . 
  tbf , not all english-speakers can pronounce the irish / ch / sound , so substituting it for a / k / sound makes sense . 
  we need some russian redditors to comment on this article . 
  it seemed really insightful . 
  if the immigrant complies with their host country 's culture and willingly integrates , yes . 
  that 's something easier and much more commonly achieved in europe between europeans and western-hemisphere migrants than between mena migrants and others . 
   why not just invest in public universities instead ? 
  well , you see , the answer is simple ... oh , look , a bird !, 
  * throws smoke grenade *, 
  sure , if enough people support this idea and their plead reaches political ears . 
  it 's a democracy after all . 
  to be fair to the ones who support a second scottish referendum though , brexit changed the game after it was decided . 
  one of the main reasons many scots voted for * remain * was to also remain in the eu . 
  and the bicycles and the clogs and the tulips and the waffles and the beer and the chocolate sprinkle toast and the weed smoke and the window hookers and the vile muslim invaders and the even viler shovel-carrying germans ... 
  they might if they 're arrogant enough and think god 's will is with them . 
  ** reeeeeeeeee **, 
  or they could go with `` thrace '' and trigger three different countries instead of just one . 
  not even . 
  it 's a fact . 
  \u266a * how about sunshine slaaavs ? 
  the australian solution is being mentioned contantly in here , but very few politicians have actually endorsed this idea . 
  for whatever reason , the members are n't willing to go for it or - afaik - even officially discuss it as an option . 
  snap out of it . 
  literally no one in here has ever called navalny a hero or a saint . 
  at this point , we might as well call it a tradition . 
  let each protest begin with navalny being arrested . 
  it 's odd how northern scandinavia has so many mosquitos , while , a little to the west/south-west , scotland and ireland have , like , only 5 mosquitos each . 
  that joke had a really good setup and execution . 
  `` ripping it off '' is an inaccurate and rather harsh way to put it . 
  the romans were open about their respect and admiration of the greek arts and culture . 
  they did n't pretend they came up with these architectural styles . 
  they simply copied them and even expanded on them . 
  a bit counter-intuitive considering denmark 's average elevation is only 34 meters . 
  according to [ wiktionary ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sakset ) , finnish * sakset * comes from swedish * sax * , which comes from the proto-germanic word * sahs\u0105 * ( meaning knife or dagger ) . 
   i really do n't understand why westerners have hard on for gulenists . 
  we ... do n't . 
  we just think it 's ridiculous how every time anything remotely critical reaches erdogan he immediately points to a `` gulenist threat '' whose danger seems greatly exaggerated .
