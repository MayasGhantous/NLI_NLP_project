  yeah , the whites were a collection of different groups with `` anti-communist sentiment '' being pretty much the only thing they had in common . 
  if they 'd won the civil war , there would have immediately been another bloodbath between their different fractions to see which one comes on top . 
  looking at a map , it looks like italy is taking the piss of slovenia more than croatia does . 
  ** greece lonk !, 
  oh , yes , she 's definitely irresponsible . 
  her actions make total sense , though . 
  she cares about her career and her party way more than `` what 's best for the country '' . 
  triggering art . 
  50 gave her the `` strong and stable '' vibe she was going for . 
  if she had n't triggered it before the election , the outcome could 've possibly been even worse for her and the tories . 
  til that 's a thing . 
  what the hell did you put on your popcorn to make it * sticky * ? 
  well , this is good news for ni , then . 
  they 'll finally get the attention they deserve . 
  budget problems . 
  all roads lead to ~ ~ rome ~ ~ amsterdam . 
  maybe some day in a century or two . 
  as an italian , you should know how difficult it would be to connect reggio with messina with an underwater tunnel . 
  and connecting the peloponnese with crete would need some sci-fi level engineering . 
  on a positive note ( for me ) , i 've been living on burgundy-coloured places for 25 years and have n't experienced an earthquake yet . 
  is the german dude looking at a glass of beer ? 
  no wonder he 's smiling . 
  `` stop funding sa '' is the only solution to this problem `` lefties '' and `` righties '' agree on . 
  no offence , but i 'll go with the * reporters without borders * opinion over some guy 's on the internet . 
   not really . 
  we have free press , there is no gloom doom propaganda here , why would our secret services bypass our journos or public ? 
  your country ranks as [ one of the worst ] ( https://rsf.org/en/ranking ) when it comes to freedom of press in europe . 
  that 's really flattering , guys , but we 're really not worth the trouble . 
  i 'd just leave this here . 
  they 'd need to escape batska 's clutches before the possibility even arises . 
  fair point . 
  we do n't really care about what name people commonly use for the country and we ca n't stop anyone from using the name ` macedonia ' for the country . 
  we just want its official name to change and the historical and cultural appropriation to stop . 
  people can colloquially use any name they want . 
  note : ** not ** the island where count monte cristo was imprisoned . 
  that would be [ this one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ch%c3%a2teau_d%27if ) . 
  hey , france , hook a brother up , wo n't you ? 
  only / u/svorky and a select few know the true meaning of `` exiting '' . 
  tbf , both countries were very bellicose historically mostly because of their expansionist imperial tendencies . 
  when you guys accept the status quo , you can be pretty chill and fun to hang around . 
  i feel like corbyn is to may what hrc was to trump . 
  the dnc picked the only candidate who could lose to trump , much like labour has the worst possible leader to go against the tories ( in their current post-brexit referendum status ) . 
  greek sounds a lot like spanish , only a bit flatter and without the flair ( if that makes any sense ) . 
  greeks who speak italian are pretty uncommon in greece , so i would n't know if it 's easy or not to learn . 
  the few italian people i 've met were very particular about their language and told me i sound like a spaniard ( i 've heard that many times abroad ) when trying to imitate their language . 
  i would n't put it past our government . 
  [ -_- ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_bailout_referendum,_2015 ), 
   but you would need to master the italian rolling `` r '' to be able to pronounce it . 
  we have the same `` r '' . 
  geminated consonants are more of an issue . 
  i feel like there 's a tongue-twister hidden in there . 
  gayrope confirmed . 
  russia was right . 
  an dag in an naht umbefangan sal sia ouir mura iro unreht in arbeit an mitdon iro in unreht . 
  in ne te fuor fan straton iro . 
  prisma in losunga . 
  uuanda of fiunt flukit mi ic tholodit geuuisso . 
  in of thie thie hatoda mi . 
  ouir mi mikila thing spreke . 
  ic burge mi so mohti geburran fan imo . 
  even 9/11 was n't a leading problem for the us when it came to deaths . 
  there were 4 times as many victims of gun homicides during the same year . 
  9/11 seems especially bad because almost all ~ 3,000 victims died in the same day from the same culprit , as well as all the terror and panic that came with it . 
   just imagine that here in greece ~ ~ most ~ ~ many people own ~ ~ at least 2 ~ ~ 1 house ~ ~ s ~ ~ in mortgage . 
  ftfy . 
  checkmate atheists !, 
  sell it back to turkey . 
  use money to pay denbt . 
  [ this beautiful musical composition ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g4nkzmfc-q ) was written by czech composer bed\u0159ich smetana as 1/6 of a [ symphonic poem collection ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m%c3%a1_vlast ) composed between 1874 and 1879 . 
  the piece refers to [ vltava ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vltava ) ( aka moldau ) , the longest river entirely within the czech republic . 
  ** sibling ** hood , you filthy gender-specifist !, 
   [ ... ] a shared genetic background , extending from sicily to cyprus and involving crete , the aegean islands and anatolia . 
  `` this shared mediterranean ancestry possibly ** traces back to prehistoric times ** , as the result of multiple migration waves , with peaks during the neolithic and the bronze age , '' ok , this makes more sense now . 
  cretan greeks are closer to sicilians than they are to peloponnesian greeks ? 
  i find this hard to believe . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the initial ** k ** makes a / ch / sound , though , which makes more sense when you say it . 
  pretty much every european language but english has a commonly used shortened form of `` czech republic '' . 
  we 're between spain and portugal ? 
  no , but as opposed to letting them figure their shit out for themselves , though i understand that 's historically a flying pig situation . 
  well , to be fair , `` on its own '' is n't fully accurate . 
  a good chunk of the middle-eastern problem comes from western powers taking control and carving it up in ways which were comfortable for the rulers , but forced large groups of very different people to live under the same administration . 
  edit : word, 
  looks like a less colourful [ wroclaw ] ( http://cdn.tourismontheedge.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/wroclaw-poland-8.jpg ) . 
  seriously , we wo n't even need to fabricate claim . 
  op 's title is basically giving it to us . 
  well , not even half a year into his presidency and he 's less popular than bush was after the iraqi invasion debacle , so macron does n't have much of a competition , really . 
  an american person in another thread , worked in japan and said that most japanese working in office buildings do n't actually work more hours , they just spend more time at work . 
  for hours every day they 'll just stare at the screen or dillydally around not actually working , but simply being present at work . 
  that 's why japan 's productivity is n't nearly as high as it should be . 
   this man is shaping up to become the new kim jong un . 
  i think he 's more of a poor man 's putin . 
  i am shocked !, 
  shocked , i tell you !, 
  seven, 
  i think it 'd be something like / med-you-vurs-yeh / . 
  keep in mind that `` j '' is pronounce like english ** y ** and that makes it substantially easier . 
  i , for one , am all up for salt and banana-powered batteries . 
   i do n't see any star hiding . 
  job well done , then . 
   something tells me that we could be better friends with russia than with turkey .
