  we could if russia saw us more as a partner than an opponent . 
   why are so many people eager to support a terror-supporting country like turkey over russia ? 
  i 'm not sure * people * support that , but eu governments certainly do . 
  but that 's because russia has made it very clear that it 's interested in the weakening and division of the west , and it 's constantly trying to achieve it through various means ( like cyberwar and meddling with elections ) . 
  it 's very likely . 
  the ottomans were heavily inspired by byzantine architecture . 
  the [ blue mosque ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/sultan_ahmed_mosque.jpg/1024px-sultan_ahmed_mosque.jpg ) 's similarity to the [ hagia sophia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/hagia_sophia_mars_2013.jpg/1280px-hagia_sophia_mars_2013.jpg ) is an evident example . 
  it refers to spain as a `` spanish lion '' , probably because you have one on your flag . 
  vive l'europe ~ ~ unie ~ ~ homosexuelle !, 
  the spanish anthem does n't mention anything to be exact . 
  ^ ^ :p but i knew what you meant ; i 've just always thought it weird to have a country 's national anthem swear loyalty to another country 's monarch . 
  you 'd expect the dutch government would 've changed it at some point after over 4 centuries of not being under spanish rule . 
  the greek national anthem also mentions several countries ( directly or indirectly ) , but not in the most commonly used first two stanzas ( the whole anthem has 158 stanzas , making it the longest national anthem by length of text ) . 
  these are : - usa ( the land of washington ) - spain ( the spanish lion ) - england - russia - italy ( the italian 's innards ) ^ ^ ew it also mentions europe . 
  do you want memelland ? 
  cause that 's how you get memelland . 
   the dutch anthem starts with `` william of nassau am i , of german blood '' ... 
  it also claims lifelong loyalty to the king of spain . 
  i 'm sure most of them want to reach the uk . 
  it 'd be interesting to see how brexiteers will deal with this post-brexit , when they wo n't be able to blame the eu for the spike in immigration . 
  there 's a lion facade at no26 ( next to a mini-lion ) and a lion statue at no32 . 
   this undermines the sense of having strongly shared history . 
  if anything , i think it reinforces it . 
  `` twelve days north of hopeless , and a few degrees south of freezing-to-death . '', 
   he will slowly begin to fade into obscurity . 
  i 'd rather he quickly slams into a wall . 
   sardinia is not among the regions with special autonomy ... wikipedia says [ it is ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regions_of_italy#autonomous_regions_with_special_statute ) . 
  jesus , you 're such a good sport !, 
  we 're trying to start a franco-italian post war in this sub , and you thwart our mischievous plans constantly . 
  just be a proper frenchperson and display some arrogance already !, 
  the fact that so many countries down in the bottom of the list have self-reported data makes this a little sketchy . 
  usually it 's because they 're not part of the eu . 
  you 'll see that slovenia and croatia are usually included . 
  well , unless you live in a cardboard box , you * do * have the financial capacity to move out . 
  [ fun ?

   ** give us a few years ** , we 'll be back on our feet ** in no time ** perhaps it 's this dissonance that has created this mess in the first place . 
  real venn diagrams have curves !, 
  yeah , but that 's not the case in every other country . 
  civil partnership is `` marriage light '' in most cases . 
  well , the police could have certainly done more than gently nudge the bodyguards who were kicking downed protesters in the face . 
  well , it 's not like many gay couples are interested in marrying in a church in front of a priest . 
  they just want their union to be acknowledged by the state on an equal level with that of hetero-couples . 
  like * even * . 
  meanwhile , he 's in talks to play genie in the upcoming * aladdin * live action adaptation . 
  ^ ^ no ^ ^ joke, 
  not really . 
  strikes are n't nearly as common as you 'd think they 'd be in our situation . 
  russians are `` less slavic '' because of russia 's much greater expansion into traditionally non-slavic territories and the assimilation of native people into the dominant russian identity . 
  no other slavic-majority country ever achieved the reach russia has . 
  also , russification ( voluntary or not ) during the imperial and the soviet years of russia was extensive and lead to a substantial percentage of partially or fully non-ethnic russians self-identify as `` russian '' nowadays . 
  such things happened in other slavic countries as well , but not to the scale it did in russia . 
  genetically , yes . 
  they have , however , been slavic trendsetters for quite some time now . 
  when most non-slavic people think of a typical slav , it 's usually a russian . 
   like - who do you even support in syria ? 
  not isis . 
  that 's pretty much the only thing we all agree on . 
  actually , ' \u03b3\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 ' is spelled [ \u029diros ] in ipa , since / \u03b3 / in ' \u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1 ' and / \u03b3 / in ' \u03b3\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 ' are not the same sound . 
  if only more people could read ipa . 
   does anyone know if sicily still has nice weather in september ? 
  it does . 
  the island 's mean temperature is in the 20s \u00b0 c during september ( warmer by the coast , slightly cooler inland ) . 
  it 's pronounced exactly as a spaniard would say ` yiros ' . 
   the ottomans stayed a neutral nation in the ww2 . 
  you mean * the turks * . 
  the ottomans were n't a thing after 1923 . 
  well , hell is literally [ in norway ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hell,_norway ) . 
  i 'd certainly avoid that . 
  in the garbage . 
  normal tapped r **  ** * `` starting a motor engine in your mouth '' * rolled r **  ** * `` i 've a kernel stuck in my throat '' * guttural r, 
  you should avoid norway , but try denmark . 
  you 'll fit right in !, 
  median wealth , yes ( i 'm also shocked by this ) . 
  but mean wealth is 112,000 in greece vs 192,000 in germany . 
  you 're right . 
  the purges were mixed . 
  to be exact , the stalin regime 's purges and deportations affected mostly * non-russians * ( at least non-ethnic russians ) in the soviet union . 
  i 'm not surprised that this many modern ethnic russians do n't really care about it . 
  does the average japanese person care about the [ chinese ethnic cleansing of the 1930s/40s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/three_alls_policy ) ? 
  does the average pakistani care about the [ 1971 bangladesh genocide ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_bangladesh_genocide ) ? 
  people tend to forget or not care about atrocities done to people outside their social/national group . 
  it 's not true for all instances ( e.g. , hitler and modern germans ) , but it 's very common . 
  at least it 's pretty low to make sense . 
  that 38 % of armenians , though , are [ criminally stupid ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian_victims_of_the_great_purge ) . 
  good to know . 
   just do n't go there in mid summer , if you are not used to 35 + degrees ... and the obligatory horde of tourists . 
  i think montenegro is the likeliest at this point , though albania is n't too far off . 
  you 're right . 
  you * are * stupidly optimistic . 
   greece ca n't become a `` mediterranean tiger '' by investing on tourism . 
  we need infrastructure , high industrialisation , and good education to achieve such status . 
  we need a competitive economy , trading exports , low labour costs , an investment-friendly system , and incentives to not throw our most educated and skilled workers out of the window . 
  we currently have almost none of these things . 
  and , even if we manage to get there , do n't forget that the bubble might pop at any time , just like it did in ireland . 
  maybe i 'm too pessimistic , but i do n't trust my government and fellow countrymen to get us there anytime soon ... :(, 
  you have to keep in mind that there was no such thing as `` celts '' back then . 
  they were very different groups of people , having different cultures , with some ( but not all ) of them speaking related languages . 
  grouping them up under the term `` celts '' came from outsiders for simplification purposes . 
  you two stop tcheppening each other with this bubkes or i 'll potch your tuchas !,
