  nobody is forcing anyone to do anything . 
  more eu integration can only be achieved willingly . 
  we may be one of the most eurosceptic countries , but greece is full of them . 
   something like 40 % of indians shit in the street still . . what works for a developing country might not work with a bunch of fully developed countries . 
  that 's why i specifically mentioned `` politically successful '' ; something that india * is * . 
   when india is as developed as europe , i could see it splitting up . 
  the uk is close to splitting up , and i imagine there 's a lot more chances in a country like india for there to be cultural , economic and social division . 
  i 'd argue that countries more often split up when in their lowest and weakest ( ussr , yugoslavia , etc ) . 
  see how the greatest threat to the eu came after the economic crisis , when multiple of its states weakened . 
  cultural and political division is still a primary reason , but , when there 's progress and prosperity , the threat of splitting up seems to be substantially lower ( usa , switzerland , etc ) . 
   depending on how the apartments are set inside , you could have one with a view of walls and people walking around in their underwear . 
  let me introduce you to [ this ] ( http://www.ikea.com/piaimages/0094492_pe232631_s5.jpg ) . 
  sea taketh and sea giveth back . 
  if india can be a successful federal state ( i mean * politically * successful ) , then so can the eu . 
  the differences between - say - an indian from arunachal pradesh and one from karnataka are at least as pronounced as the differences between germans and bulgarians ( if not more ) . 
  and that is on top of the country having over two times the population of the eu , more social and economic inequality , more cultural and religious diversity , more problems to solve and social issues to tackle , and an equally long and rich history . 
  if there comes a time when the people of the eu would want to fully unite under one country , they can definitely do it . 
  over 70 years of peace in the most war-torn continent ( at least within the eu countries ) . 
  that 's no small feat . 
  it 's also because universal health care is too `` socialist '' of a system . 
  multiple decades of red scare tactics have left americans very hostile towards anything remotely socialist . 
  tbf , no one is more enraged by the american healthcare system than americans themselves . 
  it 's good to remind them they have alternatives , even if they 're super hard to be achieved at this point . 
  it 's odd how an island with 97 % of its population being muslim coloured people gave so many of its votes to le pen . 
  if i had to guess , though , i 'd say it 's because of mayotte dealing with illegal immigration from nearby poorer countries . 
  oh , we gon ' bite it alright ... 
  should anyone care if they do n't ? 
  they corrected the placement of the words . 
  meanwhile , t_d is already saying macron has some ` splaining to do about his emails . 
  they do n't even care that they seem to be irrelevant . 
  that 's a very bland chamber of parliament . 
  * wielka grecja * is considerably wielkier than that . 
  so are ministers . 
  their rotten flesh does wonders when applied as a fertilizer . 
  names ending in * - ko * are usually feminine in japanese . 
  there 's also a comma after libert\u00e9 . 
  that 's not what an oxford comma is . 
  an [ oxford comma ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serial_comma ) is placed before * and * or * or * . 
  the sign displays the french motto as it 's [ officially displayed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/libert%c3%a9,_%c3%a9galit%c3%a9,_fraternit%c3%a9 ) each time . 
  that 's not the oxford comma . 
  it 's just that it has become too tumblry and memey nowadays , like * woke * , * lit * , * fam * , etc. 
  i know it 's a perfectly cromulent word , but it still rubs me the wrong way to read `` shook '' in a newspaper 's article . 
  they work better in the wide american streets , but european city streets are considerably narrower , which makes the situation worse . 
  especially in warmer areas , where the heat gets trapped between the buildings and the concrete , it 's like hell in summer . 
  then search for it and find it yourself . 
  last night , i was reading about the flood problem in dhaka from a local bangladeshi internet source . 
  and i was free to do it precisely because there 's media freedom in my country ( not perfect , but better than the world average ) . 
  if i was living in certain other parts of the world , i would n't have that option . 
  nobody is stopping you from educating yourself about anything going on in the world . 
  at least not while you 're living in a country with free press and unblocked internet access . 
  i 'm sure germany would also not allow americans and japanese people who are german citizens to vote on a referendum like this one . 
  this is not germany interfering in another country 's politics ; this is germany making sure its own citizens do n't violate german law . 
  it 's under-reported because it 's not globally relevant . 
  what 's going on in mongolia , uzbekistan , or mozambique does n't affect the average american , frenchman , or german much . 
  so , why would they be interested in what 's going on there ? 
  do n't forget that the press is a collection of media , which are * businesses * . 
  they employ people and need success and profits to sustain themselves and pay their employees . 
  they 're not going to cover issues that people are n't interested in , because of the little profit involved . 
  even places like iraq and syria would n't be as covered if isil was n't exporting terrorism to the west , making it an important subject for european media to cover . 
  you seem to see the press as a one-sided collective hivemind , which it clearly is n't . 
  different media are biased towards different goals and provide a diverse coverage and alternative points of view on individual news . 
  this way , people reading/watching these news have * free * options to choose from , compare them , and educate themselves ( although few people actually do that ) . 
  if you take the freedom from the press , you make all of them report the same one-sided thing for the same political agenda . 
  how is this better and/or the same ? 
  he 's from luxembourg , which has french as one of its official ( and most spoken ) languages . 
   english has been the dominant global language for well over 100 years . 
  maybe globally , but not in europe . 
  french had been the dominant european lingua franca until * at least wwii * . 
  the importance of english was elevated after that , mainly because of american hegemony in media and subcultural exports . 
  too visible !, 
   i would n't recommend it , the place * smells * . 
  there 's an aqualand right next to it , though . 
  that 's very true . 
  spain and portugal have only a couple nationalistic far-right parties , which get  1 % of the vote ( lower than in any other european country ) precisely because their experience with nationalism is still too fresh . 
  * oh , no you didnt !, 
  it 's known as the * flooded belfry * , which sounds like a nice area name . 
  will she be `` princess '' camilla , then ? 
  or will she retain the title of duchess ? 
  [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1toul4ay9k ) gives a good summary of germany 's [ mittelstand ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mittelstand ) . 
   it 's expected that when william becomes king , his wife kate will become ` queen catherine ' , officially titled the queen consort . 
  you skipped king charles and queen camilla . 
  we need a joint franco-italian grand post with pictures of similar looking beautiful landscapes , cities , buildings , etc. 
  do n't let / u/loulan read this . 
  they 'll up the french posts in a heartbeat !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ( not ^ ^ that ^ ^ i ^ ^ complain ) . 
   what is wrong with civil unions ? 
  civil unions are n't recognized equally to marriage and you do n't get to have the same rights and protections from the state , like when it comes to tax , healthcare , and inheritance benefits as well as life insurance , social security , etc. 
  civil unions are n't `` marriage minus religion '' , as many people think . 
  it 's a subpar form of marital union , which allows couples * only some * of the rights and benefits of a properly married couple . 
  sweden is an entirely different subject . 
  your government and politics are way too lenient . 
  denying other people a basic social right because it rustles your jimmies * is * textbook scummy . 
  substantial demographic shift is a * long * time from now ( if ever ) . 
  plus , native minority groups have n't even managed to push for constitutional recognition of their languages in france . 
  amending the french constitution to allow any islamic laws pass is next to impossible . 
  especially any laws messing with la\u00efcit\u00e9 , which not even the catholic church has managed to achieve . 
  we * do * have this word in our language ( * \u03bc\u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03ba\u03b1 * , pronounced / banka / ) , but it refers to the accumulation of money in the register of gambling activities ( casinos , lottery , electronic gaming , etc ) which shows the profound respect we have for banking . 
  good point !, 
  plus , the people in the more underdeveloped , rural , less populated regions can make their voice better heard by having their vote count 3x as much as mine does .
