  actually , it was pasok who brought the worst austerity . 
  nd continued it and syriza gave the final blow . 
  and no , it does n't make sense , but any other option is either also pro-austerity or to the far left/right . 
  there is a reason so many greeks are losing faith in democracy . 
  as a nation , we have trouble sustaining it because of immoral social conscience and corruption from the very small to the very big among us . 
  switching between incompetent governments seems to be the only thing left for us until someone more competent comes along and we finally change the anti-state , selfish culture that is so prevalent in this country . 
  from a linguistic viewpoint , it 's better to differentiate between serbo-croatian dialects using the [ shtokavian/chakavian/kajkavian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dialects_of_serbo-croatian ) distinction . 
  the terms `` bosnian , croatian , serbian , et al '' are mainly used for political and cultural purposes . 
  i like how half of london is n't even inside the `` republic of london '' . 
  good point . 
  i , too , urge my fellow neighbours to commit suicide . 
  this specific one is pretty on point , though . 
  tbf , syriza are the ones who got elected on the premise of no more austerity and proceeded to immediately shit all over that prospect . 
  we should counter-issue travel alert for the us , citing threat of shootouts . 
  yharnam looks pretty good during the day . 
  i did n't defend socialism . 
  i was merely stating facts . 
  full-on socialism is obviously terrible , but avoiding any socialist policy ( universal healthcare , free education , labour unions , etc ) * in a democratic background * can also allow for a horrid system of governance . 
  it 's not all black and white ; refinement of socialist merits inside a democratic system has worked for many countries . 
  fair point . 
  to make my point a little more clear , though , several states would effectively be called neoliberal or capitalist whether they admitted it or not , but no communist state ever existed ( `` communist '' as defined by the very manifesto they were looking up to ) and call itself as such . 
  textbook capitalism has been applied many times throughout history ( still is ) . 
  textbook communism remains a midsummer night 's dream ( or nightmare to be exact ) . 
  the original greek word for it was \u03bf\u03be\u03cd\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1 ( * sourmilk * ) . 
  the fact that it fell out of use and was replaced with a turkish word does n't mean its origin is turkic . 
  the modern greek word for * closet * is \u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03ac\u03c0\u03b1 , from turkish `` dolap '' ( ultimately from persian `` dolab '' ) . 
  does this mean greek people did n't have any clothing storage furniture before the turks came along ? 
  you are ready to sail to the west and remain / u/apollonasx . 
  it 's not my `` kind of thinking '' ; it 's a fact . 
  no country ever ruled under a communist one-party system called its system of governance * communism * . 
  they were all socialist states . 
  communism was the governing ideal ( most ) socialist states were trying to achieve , but none of them reached their goal and ( to my knowledge ) none of them ever claimed such a thing . 
   if you did n't want people to use it , the english should n't have come up with it . 
  that 's why we 're kicking them out of europe . 
  to be fair , it seems like the armenians came up with it first ( or at least the word for it ) , so we should all just shut up about it . 
  * whistles inconspicuously *, 
  madrid , london , vienna and stockholm having the same temperature . 
  what even ... 
  to be exact , no communist country was ever ruled by communism . 
  no , they mean like gridiron . 
  * off with the traitor 's head !, 
  no , but the way the finnish language works , you can make this word . 
  99 % of all finns , though , would n't even try to speak like that and would opt for a more periphrastic way to say the same thing . 
  i think venezuelan independence from maduro is more urgent right now ... 
  man , they must be really desperate if they think athens is attractive . 
  because it 's still the highest mountain in all the areas inhabited by ancient greeks . 
  plus , people back then would n't actually go to hiking/climbing excursions on weekends . 
  the first climbing expedition to reach olympus ' peak ( called mytikas ) was on 2 august 1913 , by two swiss men and a greek native from a nearby village ( though previous attempts were also made during the 19th century ) . 
   florian bieber , director of the center for southeast european studies in graz , austria [ ... ] said that ** eu leaders have continued to work with balkan leaders showing autocratic tendencies because they have prioritized stability over democracy ** , ( he has dubbed these places `` stabilitocracies '' ) . 
  `` there are number of other autocrats and if the eu does not take up the issue more aggressively there will be more macedonian scenarios . '' he 's right . 
  eu intervention to alter such regimes should n't be our goal ( for fear of war and more instability ) , but enabling them to exist and thrive by turning a blind eye and continuing trading relations with them is only making things worse . 
  because `` underappreciated '' does n't sound mysterious enough . 
   i think he implied muslims . 
  you assume they did , but it was n't stated . 
   the other candite ( jews ) so , you think that christians , muslims , and jews are the only `` cultures '' in the world ? 
  that 's quite a small world you 've got there ...  i find it quite insulting that he thinks ottoman judicary punished rape victims with stoning . 
  even if they did mean muslims , ottomans are not only not a thing anymore , but , even when they were , they only constituted a small part of the world 's muslim population ( excluding the non-muslim ottomans , of course ) . 
  stoning a woman for commiting adultery and/or being raped by a man who is n't her husband ( which [ is not treated differently ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zina ) under many versions of sharia law ) [ is definitely a thing today ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/a_map_showing_countries_where_public_stoning_is_judicial_or_extrajudicial_form_of_punishment.svg/863px-a_map_showing_countries_where_public_stoning_is_judicial_or_extrajudicial_form_of_punishment.svg.png ) . 
  i mean , / u/kerath mentioned neither muslims nor ottomans in their comment , so ... 
  you should post this on / r/vexillology . 
  [ indeed , we are ... ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/l2je3n9vxc8z3bate/giphy.gif ), 
  at least it 's not your whole country ... t_t, 
  did you have a chandelier in your classroom ? 
  there 's also a guy with the ~ ~ old ~ ~ real belarusian flag lurking around here . 
   erdogan calls eu all sorts of things and eu is kind of sitting there embarrassed , too scared to even do any sanctions ( maybe they ca n't even execute it ) . 
  erdogan 's insults and provocations are n't embarassing the eu ; they 're embarassing turkey . 
  if a person sitting in a crowded restaurant starts yelling profanities against another customer , the people in the restaurant wo n't stare and judge the person being insulted , but the crazy person being loud . 
   this has shown that the eu is nothing but talk , without some kind of eu military to speak a language they understand , countries like turkey will put shame to the eu . 
  the eu is `` nothing but talk '' because it has no urgent reason to be anything else . 
  turkey 's stance towards the eu has n't changed . 
  the deals are still valid ; trade continues as usual ; peace remains in the mainland ; etc. 
  although i agree that the eu needs a unified military , using such military against every nation whose government insulted the union would be too excessive and dangerously destabilizing . 
  do n't forget that the eu mainly stands because of its stable economy . 
  no official european institution will risk harming that because `` one neighbour is kinda obnoxious . '', 
   it is deplorable that this time , international law was disputed by ** the minister who is competent ** for turkey 's accession to the european union . 
  now , that 's your problem right there ... 
  / r/alliteration, 
   do n't have a say in the matter ** og ** go there unwillingly your norseness is leaking , dude . 
  that 's what happened in the 2015 general elections as well . 
  the tories got 36.8 % of the votes and ended up with 50.8 % of all mps . 
  the eu needs a unified military for more serious reasons as well . 
  yes , you 're right . 
  i edited my comment . 
  this . 
  anti-eu feelings are not nearly as prominent in france as they are in the uk . 
  the uk is the most ~ ~ eurosceptic ~ ~ anti-eu country in the eu and it still barely voted for brexit . 
  france is one of the least ~ ~ eurosceptic ~ ~ anti-eu states . 
  even if le pen wins and calls for a referendum to leave the eu , it 's highly unlikely that the french people will appease her and vote out . 
  edit : fixed words, 
   trump will rule for 4 ** or 8 years ** and * that 's * how you beat brexit . 
  truth is that the srebrenica massacre is usually ignored because it happened to a rather insignificant ( to the west ) country , like bosnia . 
  if it had happened to , say , germany or france , they 'd beat us over the head with it every anniversary of the event . 
  that being said , other `` insignificant '' countries managed to achieve at least part of their goal through other means . 
  armenia , for example , used a strong lobby and good marketing to let the world know of its genocide and have many states and political parties recognize it . 
  in any case , educating oneself about such atrocities , raising awareness , and knowing to never let them happen again should n't be left up to the state to decide ; it should be demanded . 
  fixed !, 
  well , it 's the highest mountain in our ~ ~ galaxy ~ ~ solar system , so it suits them . 
  edit : fixed word, 
  so what you 're saying is that there are 20 % more criminals walking free than 10 years ago ... / s,
