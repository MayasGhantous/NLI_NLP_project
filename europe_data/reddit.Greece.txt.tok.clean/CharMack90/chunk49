  does n't look a day over 1700 . 
  i meant the planet . 
  jeez , could n't you make the arrow any bigger ? 
  i do n't think * jupiter * saw it !, 
  the us is comfortably divided by the mississippi . 
  anything east of the river is east ; anything west of it is west . 
  maybe ask norway for ~ ~ a fyord town ~ ~ finnmark ? 
  ftfy . 
  it 's rightful finnish clay as suggested by the name , anyway . 
  although religion ( christian culture ) is a factor , the case of azerbaijan shows it 's not the only one . 
  shhh ... 
  [ \u00c5rhus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aarhus ) is the name of the city this clocktower 's in . 
  lol, 
  iirc , they both fought against the austrian empire to expand their territory and gain independence which led to unification . 
  they did n't fight any civil wars . 
  / r/evilbuildings, 
  actually , you 'd probably be like us if you joined the * euro * . 
  joining the eu should be good for you guys , as it has largely been good for us . 
  it kinda does to me . 
  portuguese songs sound like they 're in bulgarian or serbian . 
  for me , it 's either [ kokkinisto with pilaf ] ( https://www.sintagespareas.gr/images/stories/rapidrecipe/im19000/th/19548-kokkinisto-mosxaraki-me-pilafi-by-kathrinula.jpg ) or [ moussaka ] ( https://jonoandjules.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/moussaka-1.jpg ) . 
  passive-aggressive and/or bipolar girls . 
  this time we wo n't let you participate . 
  backstabbers . 
  that 's a weird law ... 
   ruder french people is that even possible ? 
  actually , we agree on the fact that alexander was macedonian . 
  it 's the definition of what constitutes a `` macedonian '' that we disagree on . 
  yay for you going up . 
   nay for us going down . 
  the more i read about this [ `` jadidism '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jadid ) , the better it looks . 
  it barely reminds me of islam . 
  that 's [ quite a stretchy `` almost '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_in_europe_by_gdp_\\ ( ppp \\ ) _ per_capita ) , but i sympathize with you . 
  fair point . 
  i was n't trying to disprove that . 
  my comment is about that fact that the uk is n't better at integrating turks than germany is . 
  it just had a `` better deal '' at hand from the start . 
  well , there were 104,507 registered voters ( 1/3 of the population ) in northern cyprus , 43,480 of whom voted in the referendum . 
  what 's that all about ? 
  were they all mainland turks ? 
  [ source ] ( http://cyprus-mail.com/2017/04/10/low-show-turkish-referendum-vote-north/ ), 
  i did n't mean that they can vote . 
  i meant that they established a western-friendly and rather progressive foundation for the mainland turks who migrated to the uk and quickly integrated with the help of the turkish cypriots . 
  the average british turk and the average german turk are two very different people . 
  most turks in the uk are either turkish cypriots ( many of whom were born as british subjects before cypriot independence ) or intellectuals and university students who came primarily in the 80s . 
  even the more rural migrants from the mainland who came in the 70s were integrated into the already existing progressive turkish diaspora in the uk . 
  turks in countries like germany , netherlands , belgium , and austria are ( descended from ) basic labourers who came mostly from rural turkey for the [ gastarbeiter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gastarbeiter ) programmes . 
   snow - * check !, 
  *  forest - * check !, 
  *  lamp post - * check !, 
  * affirmative . 
  aw , that 's so cute !, 
  anti-eu sentiment is pretty strong in greece , and anti-euro sentiment is even stronger . 
  however , most greeks are still pro-eu and pro-euro . 
  furthermore , all political parties that are n't in the far left or far right are also pro-eu ( even syriza , no matter what they claim ) . 
  we had the same issue with [ athens metro ] ( http://naturedigital.blogspot.gr/2014/12/a-metro-station-in-athens-like-museum.html ) and now have it with [ thessaloniki metro ] ( http://www.typosthes.gr/files/1/2017/02/22/metro-arxaia-stathmos-venizelou.jpg ) . 
   tempest in a tea cup . 
  to be fair , this also applies to the `` extremists will flood our country '' rhetoric that fn propagates . 
  thanks . 
  are the buildings surrounding the plaza commercial or residential ? 
  yeah , it goes so far that official statistics make a distinction between white and non-white latinos . 
   50 years ago [ ... ] america was over 95 % white . 
  more like ~ 88 % white . 
  blacks were about 10-11 % of the population , slightly lower than they are today ( 12-13 % ) . 
  it 's the hispanic/latino population that has quintupled since ( 3-4 % in the 60s to ~ 16 % today ) . 
  or bring yet another human being into this situation . 
  quite the womanizing dandy of his time , as well . 
  i read almost the entire first sentence before realizing it 's not in english . 
  i thought i was having an aneurysm . 
  seriously , any of this surplus news is anything but good news . 
  we 're currently losing weight by burning muscle . 
   now with those meddling kids out the way hes about to have a field day . 
  capital punishment for everyone !, 
  it has power through its followers . 
  if the church pushes for some political change , it can have a substantial amount of citizens back it up simply because of faith and tradition . 
  [ it has happened before ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christodoulos_of_athens#identity_cards_controversy ) and it could happen again . 
  some speak it natively wrong . 
  * eu has less power * : `` eu is useless ! '', 
  * eu has more power * : `` muh sov ` reignty ! '', 
  we should . 
  the church could use that as a weapon against the state and its decisions . 
  last thing we need now is for the church to acquire more power . 
  the syriza government is so anti-christian that they 've been pushing for such things since elected . 
  i 'm not against recognizing religions , but their actions will only bring backlash from the church and its followers . 
  well , both istanbul and ankara are large metropolitan cities that attract people from all over the country . 
  it makes sense for them to have a politically divided populace . 
  also true . 
  that 's true . 
  they 've been the majority since the '40s or so , but they were the plurality before that , since about the end-of-19th / start-of-20th century . 
  russians have been the majority in crimea for a very long time , though . 
  i believe nationality was used as a greater weapon by russia to justify the annexation of crimea . 
  the donbass crisis is a better example of the power of language . 
  it was [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paneuropean_union ) flag that was proposed to be adopted ( minus the stars at the time ) . 
  yeah ... ai n't gon na happen . 
  you could get the most unshakeable proof of the invalidity of the referendum and erdogan will still not accept it . 
  he never will and neither will the majority of the parliament . 
  nothing is gon na change the impending status quo . 
  i do n't know what secular turks have to hope for now , but a `` democratic miracle '' should n't be it . 
  it still works in asturian , galician , and catalan , though . 
  as much as she does n't want the public to remember it , she 's still her father 's daughter .
