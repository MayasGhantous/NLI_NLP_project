  i never knew there was a separate french-speaking community in belgium . 
  i thought french community = wallonia . 
  `` the ceta deal is as good as dead , '' assured us multiple high level eu bureaucrats over the last few months . 
   [ slovaks ] can communicate from polish to croatian , from czech to russian by using our mother tongue . 
  that 's a huge stretch . 
  true . 
  bremainers are better than europeans when it comes to throwing shit at brexiteers . 
   globalfirepower lists turkey as the 8th strongest military power in the world , out of 126 countries . 
  and germany 9th . 
  the two countries are [ pretty much on par ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-comparison-detail.asp?form=form&amp;country1=turkey&amp;country2=germany&amp;submit=compare ) according to them . 
   europe is coasting while the us , china and india all commit to ambitious plans ... well , the us , china , and india are singular , independent states . 
  `` europe '' is a conglomerate of independent states with multiple governments having to agree to pass laws and bring change . 
   tuesday news : * turkey legalises cannabis production *  wednesday news : * erdogan thinks that istanbul should be center of un * this ca n't be a coincidence . 
  we need a silicon valley of our own . 
  what 's a `` rich people '' ? 
   rich americans live outside the city ; rich europeans live in the city center . 
  that 's one of the most notable differences , imo . 
  maybe it was written by a belarusian . 
  in being christian . 
  same . 
  \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2 - \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1 the former is the archaic form , while the latter is the modern one . 
  the initial `` h - '' is historic and it has to do with the nation 's name as it was transcribed from ancient greek to latin . 
  it 's neither pronounced nor written in modern greek ( the sound does n't even exist in the modern language ) . 
  shut up , bulgaria !, 
  you 're the ones ruining our winning strike . 
  look at blissful bosnia . 
  it 's being made fun of by all of its neighbours and then some !, 
  we could have had that ourselves , but noooo ... god forbid bulgaria misses a chance to make fun of its little cousin instead of us . 
  screw you !, 
  i 'm ( pleasantly ) surprised . 
  as far as i know , there are no other countries ( apart from greece and cyprus ) that use `` hellas '' to refer to us . 
  three out of four land neighbours . 
  not bad . 
  in czech , they call bohemia '' \u010cechy '' as well , which is where the name '' \u010cesko '' comes from . 
  they could freely use `` bohemia '' and refer to the whole country . 
  it 's not historically inaccurate . 
  i 've heard about that before , but is it actually a common term ? 
  or is it an official term that most people do n't use ? 
  thanks !, 
  what does it mean by `` new parents '' ? 
  does it only include couples who only had their first offspring ? 
  do you mean greek macedonia is fake ? 
  am i living in the matrix right now ? 
  i meant in english . 
  we call the czech republic '' \u03a4\u03c3\u03b5\u03c7\u03af\u03b1 '' ( tseh\u00eda ) as well . 
  so what ? 
  nobody calls greece `` hellas '' or finland `` suomi '' and you do n't see anyone complain about it . 
  i 'm still up for ` bohemia ' . 
  well , `` greeks are not very productive '' is n't as catchy , now is it ? 
  still more sane than to attribute homer to turkey or kant to russia . 
  some men just want to take jocular references to popular films at face value . 
  some men just want to watch the world burn . 
  lazy northerners ... 
  a brythonic language native on french land without any close linguistic connection to either language . 
  it 's the most middle ground you can possible get . 
  ... of a drunk guy with a stutter . 
  not worth it . 
  it 's to the left , out of screen . 
  `` holding a conversation '' is easier than being fluent . 
  that as well as the very pro-western and rather progressive governmental stance since independence . 
  apparently it was only made legal in 2014 , though . 
  per capita , that is . 
  ( which matters more , i guess ), 
  it 's only illegal to promote it ( whatever that means ) , not to engage in it . 
  lebanon is understandable considering its history . 
  israel too and maybe by extension palestine as well , but jordan really is an oddity in the region . 
  it actually does . 
  it 's in the article :  a censure motion is different from a no-confidence motion . 
  depending on the constitution of the body concerned , `` no confidence '' may lead to compulsory resignation of the council of ministers or other position-holder ( s ) , whereas `` censure '' is meant to show disapproval and does not result in the resignation of ministers . 
  the censure motion can be against an individual minister or a group of ministers , but the no-confidence motion is directed against the entire cabinet . 
  [ motion of no confidence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/motion_of_no_confidence ) then ? 
  seems like a `` censure motion '' is a different thing . 
  this does sound like the next logical step ( since common currency without common fiscal policy sounds insane ) , but it 's being going on for so long and i would n't put it past eu members to keep it going even longer . 
   for the purpose of supporting security cooperation i 'm sure the fact that all of these countries are ex-soviet and/or ex-communist states is a coincidence . 
  it is . 
  it 's in the piazza navona . 
   it 's $ 200 just for school feels i 'm assuming you meant school ** fees ** there , but thank you for giving me an unintentional laugh . 
  the nobel peace prize has been criticized heavily the last few decades , but dylan 's case is about the prize in literature , which is almost universally respected . 
  it mostly is , yes . 
  in greece , people used to live in their family homes until they were about to marry and move to a new home of their own ( with their spouse ) where they 'd start their own family . 
  even people who fared better ( economically ) did that . 
  the current crisis made things more profound , but not as much as people outside of greece may think . 
  the `` kick-your-kid-off-your-house-once-they-hit-18 '' norm is not part of our culture . 
  never was . 
  / u/tihomirbz is spot on with this one :  all that simply because i was born in the `` wrong '' country ... economic immigrants from spain , portugal or italy are generally more welcome and feel safer in the uk than their counterpart from poland , romania , or bulgaria . 
  in the case of middle eastern immigrants/refugees you have people with an obviously very different lifestyle and culture coming to your country , but what about european immigrants ? 
  are spaniards * that * different from poles on a sociocultural level in britain ? 
  is it a latent ex-socialist perception that skews british public opinion ? 
  what is it ? 
  $ 1.25 for shawarma warships is an even better deal . 
  it 's a bit more expensive , but you get extra ~ ~ guns ~ ~ ingredients . 
  i do n't think the french were ever ungrateful towards that , but okay . 
  what 's this ?!, 
  people called ` slovakes ' , they go , the house ? 
  not only that , but ireland might keep gaelic as a matter of national pride , so ... could the eu be left without english as one of its official languages ? 
  can countries register more than one language ? 
  i mean ... considering their own [ coat of arms ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/royal_coat_of_arms_of_the_united_kingdom.svg/1024px-royal_coat_of_arms_of_the_united_kingdom.svg.png ) features not one , but * two * french mottos ( both a modern and an old one ) , you 'd expect them to be more open to french as a whole . 
  i agree . 
  the english language does n't need to infect other languages with its obsession with portmanteau words . 
  why do n't we just accept may 's vetoes as long as her country is still part of the eu and quickly reverse them the moment brexit kicks in ?
