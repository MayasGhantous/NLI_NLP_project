  i do n't know where you live , but in greece nearly every family home has a landline . 
  even if people rarely use it ( like i do in my home ) it 's still there . 
  maybe people who started a family in the last 5-10 years or so are more likely not to have a landline , but pretty much everybody else does . 
  the `` z '' comes from the [ oxford spelling ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oxford_spelling ) , actually . 
  it 's not just an american innovation . 
  `` if you do n't allow us to have the independence referendum , we 'll declare independence ! '', 
  to the shock of absolutely no one . 
  `` not finding the entrance '' is legit my no1 phobia when visiting new buildings . 
  i was actually born over a decade after that film came out , but a friend likes it so much he quotes it pretty often . 
  plus , who 's to say people ca n't or wo n't watch films from an earlier era ? 
  and yes to the landline ( they 're still pretty common ) , but no to the phonebook . 
  ah yes , but no more old wine . 
  lets splurge !, 
  bring us some fresh wine !, 
  the freshest you 've got - this year !, 
  no more of this old stuff . 
  actually , several dictators ( mao , franco , pinochet , idi amin , and others , i 'm sure ) died in peace , even while in power sometimes . 
  they 're made all over the country to my knowledge . 
  it 's the traditional way of making yogurt . 
  especially flanders and holland . 
  you 're right , but the `` dumb nationalists '' living in europe are more dangerous to us than the ones in turkey . 
  it 's the american way , though . 
  we could ask cia for a small favour . 
  i feel obligated to inform you that / u/executivemonkey was making a [ canary ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/serinus_canaria_-parque_rural_del_nublo%2c_gran_canaria%2c_spain_-male-8a.jpg/1280px-serinus_canaria_-parque_rural_del_nublo%2c_gran_canaria%2c_spain_-male-8a.jpg ) joke the whole time . 
  i 'm not sure you realized . 
  that 's [ kinda pushing it ] ( https://www.google.gr/maps/place/23%c2%b052'48.0%22n+20%c2%b042'36.0%22w/@25.9456286,-20.4294513,1022701m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d23.88!4d-20.71?hl=el ) , do n't you think ? 
  it 's funny because most greeks do n't even know who he is , let alone that he was born in greece and is part of the old greek royal family . 
  if we are to consult the polls ( though they are not exactly trustworthy , i know ) , we 'll see that erdogan 's rallies and comments the last few months have n't exactly swayed public opinion by much . 
  the referendum outcome seems to be hovering around 50 % for each side . 
  the fact that the outcome of the vote is such a toss-up shows that he is n't as good of a politician as you may think he is . 
  we 'll see if that 's true in less than a day , i guess . 
  yes . 
  the [ population exchange ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/population_exchange_between_greece_and_turkey ) was a bistate decision . 
  i think you need to look up the definition of [ ethnic cleansing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_cleansing ) . 
  / u/anarchism4thewin is n't wrong . 
  s\u00f6tnos , do n't hurt me ... 
  constant ** o ** nop ** o ** le , apparently ... 
  for how much it costs it better be . 
  not with that attitude !, 
  fair point . 
  turkey looks so smol . 
  also , taking the bosphorus from istanbul takes away half of its beauty . 
  not to mention that the rest of the city sits across the sea . 
  it 's the [ po valley ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/po_valley ) , where about 1/3 of the population of italy resides . 
  that 's 20 million people in an area the size of the netherlands , so it 's appropriately as brightly lit as the netherlands ( pop . 
  17 million ) . 
  can you feel the lav tonight ? 
   esperanto is still kept alive to this day by a fair number of enthusiasts . 
  not only that , but it 's the only constructed language that has native speakers . 
  the eastern arch of mozambique looks very much like the one of spain . 
  is the font used inspired by middle earth maps ? 
  the union of atheists in greece responds in a rather aggressive way this year , based on this sentiment . 
  they organized for today , good friday , [ `` meat-eating parties '' ] ( http://www.documentonews.gr/article/parti-kreatofagias-ths-enwshs-athewn-th-megalh-paraskeyh ) in several cities around the country and invited people to take part in their so called `` visible supper '' , a tongue-in-cheek inverted version of the mystical supper ( which is the name the orthodox church uses for the last supper ) . 
  personally , i find it as a quite crass way to buck the system , but i appreciate the fact that people are free to do it . 
   i 'm taking a break from r/asoiaf fandom , if i have to argue who inherits the iron throne one more time ... !, 
  still modding , but i expect i 'll be back to the sub for real sometime around s07 . 
  i 'm on my 6 month chip as we speak , but i 'll probably break my abstinence once s07 drops ( ~ ~ or when * twow * comes out ~ ~ oh , who am i kidding ... ) and be more active for a couple of months until the next long winter comes . 
  at least / r/europe is somewhat refreshing its banter every now and then . 
  / r/asoiaf during its mid-season & mid-book limbo is a desperate breeding ground for circlejerking , repeated arguments , and theories that make as much sense as patchface , i know , i know , oh , oh , oh ...  who are the mannis-bros and dany-lovers of r/europe ? 
  eu-skeptics and federalists ? 
  i mean ... dany is constantly going on about `` breaking the wheel '' i 'm not sure , but i could totally see dany using the ` keine bremsen ' slogan in the near future . 
  / r/asoiaf mods are leaking into / r/europe . 
  go back to dissecting the d+d = t ~ ~ theory ~ ~ fact and take your insightful posts about friendship and cooperation between european nations away from here !, 
  no , i meant the baltic greek colony of \u039a\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03b9\u03be\u03b2\u03ad\u03c1\u03b3\u03b7 . 
  sneaky kaliningrad is still in place and still bears the name of russia ... 
   ~ ~ smaller ~ ~ 0 ~ ~ chance of a ~ ~ terrorist attack * yet * . 
  and let 's hope this does n't change . 
  you 've a little vanilla dropping down your ` u ' there ... 
   anyone seeing us with that thing would automatically think we are villains . 
  or assume you study at a school of wizardry . 
  actually , the shire is heavily based on ( pre-industrialized ) england and the hobbits on englishmen . 
  iirc , tolkien himself confirmed the connection and he furthermore placed the shire in the same geographic coordinates as england and gave it a similar climate and natural environment . 
  you probably do n't remember correctly . 
  strictly speaking , ` let 's go ' is also plural . 
  no one expects tourists to be able to speak greek , so we 're 100 % okay with english . 
  maybe because they had to live for 40 years under a [ regime ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/francoist_spain ) which was n't very tolerant , the memory of which is still very fresh . 
  same thing with [ portugal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estado_novo_ ( portugal \\ ) ) . 
   here is a linguistic map of france http://www.college-jean-monnet-broons.ac-rennes.fr/sites/college-jean-monnet-broons.ac-rennes.fr/local/cache-vignettes/l500xh481/abb5_gr-c0319.jpg ah , yes ... the delicious dialect of croissant . 
  there is also \u0395\u03b3\u03b3\u03cd\u03c2 \u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae ( near east ) , which is a more historic term . 
   ... when europe 's namesake was being abducted , ~ ~ raped ~ ~ seduced and then ~ ~ discarded ~ ~ crowned queen of crete . 
  ftfy . 
  seriously , the `` rape '' of europa is probably a medieval invention . 
  the oldest sources clearly speak of seduction . 
  tbf , though , there is n't much of a difference between the two in ancient greek myths . 
  actually , bagpipes are ancient instruments . 
  they do n't originate from scotland or ireland . 
  i bet the light blue vs blue distinction comes from the * \u0433\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0439 * vs * \u0441\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0439 * distinction in the language, 
  exactly this . 
  monarchs are the heads of state and important figureheads for historic and cultural reasons . 
  even outside constitutional monarchies , the presidents of parliamentary republics have the same role . 
  there would n't be any reason to change that . 
  if you check out a [ map ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prevalence_of_circumcision ) of male circumcision prevalence , you 'll see that the us is one of the few non-muslim majority countries where circumcision is practiced by the majority . 
  in my experience , the vast majority of europeans will tell you that they do n't care whether their sex partner is circumcised or not , but they 're certainly more `` used '' to seeing uncircumcised penises . 
  greece : apricot , cherry , strawberry pretty sure all three of them are more-or-less equally common . 
  there are quite a few `` varieties '' ( as usually called ) of greek , but most of them are relatively easy to understand for someone who only speaks the standard modern language . 
  some of the hardest ones , though , are pontic , cretan , cypriot and tsakonian . 
  crete . 
  it 's mostly when it comes to the general bravado and obsession with guns . 
  the [ mani peninsula ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mani_peninsula ) comes close enough , as well . 
  i may be wrong , but i get british vibes from their comment .
