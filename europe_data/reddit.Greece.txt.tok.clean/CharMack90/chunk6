  would be a nice `` fuck you '' to her and her thinkalikes . 
  fixed !, 
  he was also directly responsible for the death and persecution of thousands of greeks whose descendants currently live in and around thessaloniki ( among other places ) . 
  edit : fixed wrong word, 
   spain was always spanish . 
  get outta here , with this nonsense !, 
   maybe the fact that spain and portugal are the only 2 countries in europe without a far right party should give a hint . 
  that 's mainly because spain and portugal are the only european countries that had ~ 40 consecutive years of fascist/military dictatorship during the last century . 
  they 've had their fill and are ( thankfully ) done with it . 
  the term you 're both looking for is ` waste-of-space ' . 
  yeah , i 'm not saying that it 's a bad thing or anything ; just that 's it 's really odd . 
  entire nations were born , developed , and even perished during the time scots spent being seemingly okay with having their country being part of britain , while not fully adhering to what britain actually stands for . 
  to put it into perspective , pretty much all italians ( with only a few exceptions ) adhere to `` italianness '' even though they were united under the same ruler and started being part of the same country less than half of the time scotland did that with the uk . 
  tbf , they bent their knees to a [ scottish king ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/james_vi_and_i ) after the union of the crowns . 
  they could n't possibly have known they 'd eventually end up being subjected to a german queen . 
  `` britishness '' , though , even after 300 + years of being part of the same country as england , has n't caught up in scotland as much as you 'd expect it to :  in the 2011 census , 62 % of scotland 's population stated their national identity as ` scottish only ' , 18 % as ` scottish and british ' , 8 % as ` british only ' , and 4 % chose other national identities . 
  that 's quite remarkable . 
  just substitute the red part with [ orange ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prince%27s_flag ) and you 're set . 
  yep . 
  the [ average wage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage#map ) , though ... 
  or an incinerator , preferably . 
   ... decided to resolve ** problem ** of mixed gender based education ... request this ** incompatible education system ** to be ended . 
  problem for whom ? 
  incompatible with what ? 
  if they want to be taken at least semi-seriously , they need to provide * some * reason as to why mixed gender classes are not good for turkey . 
  that too . 
  also a more euro-sceptic government . 
  i think our main problem is the lack of exercise in most people 's lives . 
  italy is currently more likely to exit first , considering its economy is imploding . 
  greece could potentially follow . 
  we have enough morons of our own to deal with . 
  oddly enough , greenland 's government opted-out from the paris climate deal even though it 's one of the most affected regions of the world . 
  i understand that the greenlandic economy would take a big hit and any possibility for full independence from denmark would have to be pushed back , but putting your politico-economic issues over the very environment you live in is plainly wrong . 
  the only positive about this is that greenland 's low population should n't amount to a great deal of climate interference in the area . 
  so , is eleanor of aquitaine ( 1122 - 1204 ) related to all of the current royal families ? 
   the ** prevailing ** religion in greece is that of the eastern orthodox church ... that 's the key word : * prevailing * . 
  the constitution merely recognises the religious denomination of the majority of the country 's citizens as it has been since the creation of the modern greek state . 
  it 's a cultural and historical nod , not an official status provision . 
  it may seem like it does , but greece does n't have a [ state relgion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_religion ) . 
  a lesser nation would retaliate and force the western thrace turks out of greece after that event . 
  tit for tat . 
  i know many consider us schmucks for not punching back , but i hold it as a sign of magnanimity that the greek government and populace of the time did n't retaliate . 
  it was the right choice . 
  then if he is , he chose the worst possible way for him to do it : the democratic one . 
  calling for a referendum will only give a negative result to turkish expansionism . 
  it does n't have a majority ( not even a plurality ) in western thrace or cyprus or bulgaria or georgia or any other country or ( semi - ) autonomous region outside turkey . 
  his words are pure demagoguery trying to convince the turkish citizens he 's a strong-willed patriot and they have no reason to doubt his position and authority . 
  you make a great point . 
   greece is n't a secular country and church and state are n't separated . 
  yes , they are . 
  greece is officially secular . 
  greek orthodox christianity gets to be referenced as the majority religion in the constitution for historical reasons , but it 's not an official state religion the way anglicanism is in england or sunni islam is in egypt . 
  the fact that religious behaviour among individuals and institutions is abundant does n't mean greece is n't secular . 
  it just means that there are many religious people who adhere to the same religious denomination . 
  greek culture is intertwined with ( greek ) orthodox culture and its values are the same . 
  the state itself takes a clear non-religious stance towards its subjects and orthodoxy does n't get to have special privileges among other religions . 
  they could disallow slovaks from entering china in the future . 
  i 'm sure at least , like ... 10 people will be bummed about that . 
  not exactly the same thing . 
  guns are specifically made to kill . 
  ~ ~ knifes ~ ~ knives are primarily made to chop bread and other foodstuffs , but can also be used to kill . 
  but so are other cutleries , frying pans , bottles , pens , vases , chairs , books ... you get the point . 
  edit : typo, 
  greece is a secular country . 
  the church and the state are separate as dictated by the constitution . 
  this does n't mean that the church does n't have any power over the people , though . 
  that 's why it tries to use its authority over the religious citizens to achieve its political goals . 
  because it does n't have any leverage inside the parliament or any other government sector . 
  according to some scentists , most people fall somewhere between the [ kinsey scale ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kinsey_scale ) . 
  that 's when social pressure comes into play , i think . 
  if someone is [ cold math ahead ] say , 80 % hetero-leaning - 20 % homo-leaning and lives in a society where homosexuality is widely considered to be the work of devil , then you can bet that 20 % will most likely be supressed and never be freely explored . 
  environment is a factor , but most likely not the main one . 
  not exactly the same thing , since isis hates other fundamentalist muslims as much as anyone else . 
  terrorism has actually claimed far more muslim lives than non-muslim ones . 
  it 's equally sickening though , do n't get me wrong . 
   basically if you put same individual grow in a hetero environment he would develop hetero tendencies , and if he would grow in a homo environment he would develop homo tendencies . 
  ofc this is mostly a philosophical debate as there is no empirical data ( and it would never be , it is impossible to conduct such a study anyway ) . 
  it 's true we 'll never be able to scientifically prove something like this . 
  the fact , however , that there are countless of instances of homosexual behaviour among people living in conservative societies where homosexuality is n't displayed and is even legally persecuted , shows that someone 's social environment is n't necessarily a factor . 
   also no they do n't make the argument that `` you should not have the same rights i do '' because they , themselves , are n't planning to get married to the same sex . 
  this is like a few thousand men protesting against abortion because they , themselves , are n't planning to have one . 
  it * does n't * have any particular influence over the state . 
  that 's why the clergy nags and growls . 
  because they try to get some . 
  a couple does n't need to marry to have or raise children . 
  equal social rights is progress , is n't it ? 
  why do n't you start with the rest of schleswig before claiming the whole country . . ? 
  i 'm familiar with the act of union , but the name `` united '' in the country 's name is mostly of historical value . 
  the unity comes from the fact that the previous kingdom of england and kingdom of scotland combined into the united kingdom of great britain ( and ireland ) in 1801 . 
  they were united countries , but within * one * kingdom under * one * monarch ( first established in 1707 ) . 
  my point is that even if scotland leaves the union , the rest of the country will still be a * united * kingdom , with the difference that the unity would be between its current home countries ( england , wales , and northern ireland ) . 
  that 's why it 's united kingdom , not kingdom ** s ** . 
  it 's one kingdom with one throne that currently includes great britain ( including england , wales , and scotland ) and northern ireland . 
  there are also other territories and crown dependencies that are part of it but they do n't make it to the title . 
  do they ? 
  i thought the de-stalinization process got rid of them all . 
  that 's literally what the first referendum did in 2014 . 
  55 % of scots decided for all of them . 
  not really . 
  there could be the * united kingdom of england , wales , and northern ireland * .
