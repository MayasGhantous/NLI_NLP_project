  does n't sound bad . 
  we do n't do large rivers in britain , ireland , italy , and greece . 
  one of the most shocking things i 've heard is about the ambulances in the us and how the ride is charged to the patient . 
  there are many people suffering from chronic diseases ( like epilepsy ) who have cards on them saying `` in case of seizure , do n't call an ambulance '' because they ca n't afford it ( it goes up to several hundred dollars in some regions ) . 
  we have the third most efficient health care system in europe ? 
  seriously ? 
  it 's an actual first and last name in arabic , though . 
  they realised all those dams and dikes are perfect for sound amplification . 
   the english do n't really have much that is completely unique to england how about [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/morris_dance ) little gem ? 
  though it 's my understanding that most englishmen hate it for some reason . 
  because private healthcare is more profitable and business-friendly . 
  one of the least interesting ones , but similar to the picture ; i agree . 
  wrong . 
  * italy * has the hottest math teacher in the world !, 
  his father ... ? 
  are we talking about his majesty the queen ? 
  i believe his older sister will take the throne since sweden has equal primogeniture laws . 
  that rather annoying misconception was debunked over a decade ago . 
  try to keep up . 
  in which universe did stalin harness religious nationalism for geopolitical gains ? 
  did n't he promote atheism , spread anti-religious propaganda , and persecute devout individuals ? 
  i 've heard this one as well . 
  apparently , the `` blonde race '' ( aka the russians ) is going to ~ ~ liberate ~ ~ conquer ~ ~ constantinople ~ ~ istanbul from the ~ ~ ottomans ~ ~ turks and give it back to the ~ ~ byzantines ~ ~ greeks . 
  other formerly hellenic cities/areas may or may not follow that . 
  when it comes to the turks , one third will be christianised , one third will be slaughtered ( eesh !, 
  ) , and one third will `` return where they came from '' ( wherever * that 's * supposed to be ) . 
  it goes without saying that it 's a quite preposterous tale . 
  greeks do n't believe that ( the vast majority are n't even familiar with it ) any more than scandinavians believe in ragnarok or some other `` prophetic '' mumbo jumbo . 
  do n't take any of this horseshit at face value . 
  it comes from overly religious quixotic dreamers who want to believe past glory will come to greece again through divine intervention ( because god loves the greeks more than anyone else * ) . 
  * ^ ^ according ^ ^ to ^ ^ the ^ ^ greeks, 
  no , not really . 
  both moscow and brussels would be more-or-less equally foreign to the average greek citizen . 
   bulgaria , ** hungary ** , latvia , serbia , and slovakia  eastern europe hungarian trigger alert !, 
  not really possible considering there 's no turkish minority in the area or any political support from the public towards him . 
  bank robbers or robbing bankers ? 
  because one of them is in high demand nowadays . 
  that 's right . 
  millions !, 
  all 0.5 of them !, 
  the us armed radical rebels to fight against the afghani pro-soviet government . 
  the reason they did that was that the socialist threat seemed more important than the radicalized islamic one during the cold war . 
  coming back around and biting the us in the ass a few decades later is entirely america 's fault . 
  how on earth was it `` completely justified '' ? 
  to be accurate , you entered the uk mainly because of the darien scheme blunder . 
  ( * checks flair * ) o-okay ... 
   why would someone study medicine here is beyond my understanding . 
  it 's cheaper . 
  relax , dude , it 's only been 2 hours . 
   i also think that the outer schengen border should be a shared responsibility and that ** it should be really really hard to illegally enter the schengen area ** . 
  well , it 's sadly not and it will never be . 
  geographically speaking we 're at an impasse . 
  there are greek islands that have coasts only a couple of miles off of turkey . 
  certain passageways are so narrow that there are no international waters as a buffer zone between the two countries . 
  the moment a boat leaves turkish territorial waters it enters greece and , by extention , schengen the eu . 
  i ca n't think of any way that `` border control '' can help stop migrants from overcoming such a short obstacle . 
  there we go again ... - `` tight '' borders are n't a thing . 
  a fence may be able to keep people from coming in ( though not always ) , but there 's no way to build a fence or a wall on sea . 
  - letting people sink and drown is inhumane and illegal ( according to eu law ) . 
  - stopping them midpoint and turning them back can only be accomplished if the previous host-country agrees to it . 
  if not , a clear breach of non-eu borders must occur and that 's a casus belli if i 've ever seen one . 
  - the only way to `` stop immigrants from entering the schengen area by sea '' is to let them die or kill them on sight . 
  does this sound acceptable to you ? 
  so ... britain . 
  greece would be a guy with a cross in hand fighting with the waves . 
  `` i see the sky * blurgh * , the sky * blurgh * , again the sk - * blurgh * ... '', 
  make an alliance with the austrians ( who are sweet-eyeing south tyrol ) , ~ ~ invade ~ ~ support a legitimate insurection together , and you 've got yourselves a new region to ~ ~ tax ~ ~ enjoy its beauty . 
  yeah , we had ~ 25 \u00b0 c in athens today . 
  i 'd expect stockholm to be considerably colder . 
  it 's probably the hit ** tit ** e. ^ ^ / s, 
  the city was originally known as `` iluh '' until it was renamed `` batman '' ( from the nearby batman river ) in ** 1957 ** . 
  super-hero batman 's first appearance was in * detective comics * in ** 1939 ** . 
  the way i see it , it 's dc that needs to sue the city . 
  let me introduce you to the [ `` generic you '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generic_you ) . 
  you should . 
  about 3/4 of the population there speaks french , which is convenient enough . 
  that 's partly because these cities were capitals and commercial centers of their own electorates or dukedoms for centuries before being integrated into prussia and further on into germany . 
  it 's not . 
  if the person is fully integrated in danish society , takes pride in it , and tries to maintain it , you and the state have no reason to belittle their `` danishness '' over someone who has viking blood in their veins . 
  the only thing that might be different is someone 's looks , but only a racist and a bigot would place someone 's appearance over their essence when it comes to political and social rights . 
   let people decide for themselves what they are . 
  that 's pretty much what fyrom did and look where that got us . 
  ( though i suppose they are more of an exception than the rule itself ) . 
  * i 'm * not . 
  how the hell is `` do n't know '' so high in so many cases ? 
  [ blue banana ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_banana ), 
  what you claim to believe in and what you really believe in can be two very different things . 
  greece , for example , is supposedly over 95 % orthodox christians . 
  in reality , the number of agnostics/atheists ( who simply follow greek orthodox traditions/customs without adhering to the religion itself ) lowers that number considerably . 
  the sea will reclaim flevoland in due time . 
  zuiderzee will rise again , mightier than ever !, 
  turkey is apparently the new russia with a couple years lag . 
  it has no mandate for soft brexit either . 
  it 's only supposed to exit the union as decided by the referendum . 
  the way that is achieved is up to the parliament . 
  the fa\u00e7ade with the arched doors and windows on the wall right under the main street is glorious !, 
  i love how the stairs go down into the sea . 
  during his life , yes . 
  but mao 's cult of personality has wound down since his death , while atat\u00fcrk 's only became stronger . 
  there are also millions of chinese people who hate mao and his legacy ( and for good reason ) , while atat\u00fcrk is glorified by pretty much everyone in turkey .
