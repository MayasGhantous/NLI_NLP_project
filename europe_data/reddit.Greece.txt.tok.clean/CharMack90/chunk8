  the country would like to get your tax money without having to share it with another one . 
   a state nationalism was and is held together by atat\u00fcrk as some kind of untouchable leader figure , to such an extent , that ** it might be seen as cult of personality ** . 
  mustafa kemal 's case is * definitely * a cult of personality . 
  his portrait is hung on every civil service building ( and many public ones ) , school , hospital , and court of law , as well as lots of private residences . 
  his name is given to hundreds of avenues , bridges , squares , parks , stadiums , universities , hospitals , etc. 
  insulting him is criminalised in turkey and his [ mausoleum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/an%c4%b1tkabir ) in ankara is nothing short of a place of worship , especially during national holidays . 
  the house he grew up in , the ones he lived , the bed he died on , etc are treated like they 're sacred . 
  he is by far the most venerated person in the history of modern turkey and his epithet `` atat\u00fcrk '' literally means `` father of turks '' to show how important his contribution was to the creation of the republic . 
  his cult of personality ( even almost 80 years after his death ) is so intense that not even people like guevara , lenin , or mao could match it . 
  do n't most french citizens have foreign origins nowadays ? 
  the hungarians did as well . 
  the name ` sarkozy ' comes from s\u00e1rk\u00f6z , hungary . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_siege_of_malta ), 
  i 'm curious ... what 's exactly the percentage of dyslexics in german-speaking countries ? 
  the latin alphabet usage was a good idea . 
  i was mostly referring to his efforts to oust persian and arabic loanwords from the language and replace them with turkic-derived words ( which sort of succeeded to a degree ) . 
  you had a lot more before kemal `` purified '' the language . 
  actually sardinian is considered closer to latin ( especially the conservative nuorese dialect ) , though that 's mostly when it comes to phonology . 
  in reality , it 's rather hard to simply say which romance language is most like latin , though romanian is close enough . 
  i believe that the arabs thought that the al - in ` alexander ' was the article , so that 's why the went with al-iskandar/al-iskender . 
  so , the same only with an article preceding it . 
  not just the hagia sophia . 
  albout 20 other byzantine temples ( originally christian churches ) were repurposed as islamic mosques in istanbul . 
  depends on if they have money ( expats ) or not ( immigrants ) . 
  you 're the big guy and you 'll be compared to both positively and negatively until you fall from first place . 
  deal with it . 
  what are you on about ?!, 
  andreas papandreou 's government tripled the salaries of civil servants and pensioners and created a whole crowd of pasok-followers based on borrowing money to keep his party strong . 
  the economy of greece starting going to hell long before kostas karamanlis took control . 
  sell out ? 
  no shock there . 
  have you seen how low their corporate tax is ? 
  i can barely keep myself from setting up a business there . 
  not to mention that gibraltarians are still very pro-uk and have little interest in leaving it . 
  * 1713 never forget *, 
  - thousands have already left . 
  almost half a million in the last 8 years . 
  - many want to leave , but ca n't due to lack of skill , money to resettle , and/or a secure job prospect . 
  - others do n't want to jump ship . 
  maybe it 's because of national pride or because they believe their future is better in greece than abroad , but they refuse to try their luck elsewhere ( for now ) . 
  it 's not an easy choice and there are quite a few variables involved . 
  we actually export way more foodstuffs than we import . 
  the problem is that the ones we import are more expensive than the ones we export . 
  of course it is . 
  the political , cultural , social , historical , linguistic , religious , etc differences between us states are miniscule in comparison with the vast differences between european nations . 
  even a half-assed federation is a summer night 's dream in europe . 
  fair point . 
  i used a more generalised definition , but yours is more technically valid . 
  bombing the hell out of your capital counted as * some * form of invasion , though , right ? 
  not the kind of armies marching through the city , but the borders of the country were breached and enemy forces clearly attacked british soil . 
  the us can live with its debt . 
  lots of ez states ca n't . 
  if you do n't count the ` blitz ' of 1940-41 . 
  it takes time to change the sociopolitical landscape of a nation . 
  toppling the previous government and establishing a new constitution is a good start , but the people 's minds wo n't change so fast . 
  you need to wait until younger people ( cultivated in democratic values ) are old enough to constitute the majority of the voting populace and want to bring true democratic change to their country . 
  both hungary and romania are on a good path so far . 
  i , personally , am optimistic about both countries . 
   where they are all represented equally and that 's the catch . 
  if this does n't happen , no true voluntary union will ever ensue . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.euratlas.net/history/europe/1900/1900.jpg ) is a map of europe at the start of the 20th century . 
  [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/europe_countries_map_en_2.png ) is a map of europe now . 
  there are almost three times as many sovereign nations now than there were back then . 
  if anything , the rise of nationalism has made us more politically divided than ever , even with organisations like the eu or efta in place . 
  the individuals suspended so far are well into the 100,000 . 
  the [ freedom of press index ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/rwb-pressfreedomindex-worldmap.svg/863px-rwb-pressfreedomindex-worldmap.svg.png ) gives a good indication of the situation , though it 's not entirely accurate . 
  britain = england in many english minds too . 
  the uk referendum for eu membership was non-binding as well and look how that turned out . 
  yes . 
  no , the fall immediately led to the largest drop . 
  it was after that that the ottomans brought in more people and the population started rising again , though the population decline obviously started almost 5 centuries before the fall . 
  the title gave me a migraine . 
  i read the title 15 times before realising `` axe '' is supposed to be the verb in the sentence . 
  exactly . 
  erdogan will only use religion as a tool if it helps him gain more popular support . 
  if not , he 'll keep tooting the secular horn . 
  [ here . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/istanbul-population-log.svg ) just like in rome , the fall of the city led to the greatest population drop in its history . 
  pension at 65 2 . 
  euthanasia at 70 3 . 
  the potato blight covered all of europe . 
  you ca n't blame the british for that . 
  virginia 's population during the declaration of independence was twice that of maryland , almost 5 times that of new hampshire , and over 10 times that of delaware . 
  / u/slopeclimber is right . 
  the uk is officially a unitary state . 
  if he wants to question lausanne and go back to the treaty of s\u00e8vres ' definition of borders , [ we 're okay ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/treatyofsevres_%28corrected%29.png ) with that ... 
  and then what ? 
  what does the catalan government have in mind the next day after independence becomes possible ? 
  i 'm honestly interested . 
  is there any solid plan ? 
   oh , sweet summer child ... / r/asoiaf, 
  this is ridiculous !, 
  finland is as real as bielefeld . 
  i mostly agree , but the problem is that * everyone * will go down with the banks ; not only bankers . 
   the scandinavian country , which has not seen armed conflict on its territory in ** two centuries ** ... that 's quite remarkable by european standards . 
  i mean , it 's a nap . 
  * of course * it 's more common among the elderly . 
  it looks so funny the way it pops out of nowhere . 
  it 's like : '' \u00bf qu\u00e9 ondas , carnales ? '', 
  i think it 's more of an * italic * claim than a ** bold ** one .
