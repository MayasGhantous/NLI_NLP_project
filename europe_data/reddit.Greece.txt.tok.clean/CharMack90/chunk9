  do n't be . 
  that was the funniest part . 
  externalizing internal problems is not uncommon for the turkish government . 
  * jacob marley returns to haunt ebenezer scrooge on christmas *, 
  mark my words ; iceland will be the first nation in the world to grant equal rights to elves . 
  they 've already began [ academic research ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/icelandic_elf_school ) on them . 
  [ actual dutch family . 
  ] ( http://www.performance-vision.com/holiday-08--beavers.jpg ), 
  that dates back to the neolithic era . 
  it 's too far back into history . 
  modern national and ethnic notions did n't exist that far back . 
  there was no such thing as greeks , turks , italians , etc. 
  just small , semi-related hunter tribes moving from one place to the other . 
  well , you openly declare eternal honour to the king of spain in your national anthem ... 
  although it 's true that many greeks of eastern thrace and anatolia first acquired surnames under ottoman rule ( resulting in many turkish-sounding surnames among greeks ) , the `` same ancestors '' thing is largely not true . 
  due to different religions and cultural clashes , greco-turkish marriages where extremely rare . 
  modern greeks do n't generally have turkish ancestors , while there are at least some turks with greek blood in them ( because of a few cases of greeks converting to islam during ottoman years ) . 
  they occasionally use * stone * too , which is super weird . 
  it 's an alphabetical thing . 
  next up are the joint drills of jamaica and jordan . 
   you have n't had to fight a war against foreign invaders on your home soil for centuries excluding the german bombing raids of 1940-41 , you mean . 
  but a british driver is placed on the right side of the car , both literally and figuratively . 
  there 's definitely a very important ^ ^ ( / s ) clash of ideas here ... 
  you mean the slavo-southserbo-westbulgaro-northmacedonian mess ? 
  yeah ... that 's equal amounts of infuriating and awkward . 
  he 'd be boris * kemal * ( instead of johnson ) if his grandfather had n't changed his surname . 
  it 's a romanian term actually . 
  we have lots of trustworthy data from our past to relax back on our chaise-longues and be content with the knowledge of our hefty mark on this world . 
  granted , the chaise-longue may be on fire , but it 's still pretty comfy . 
  more like \u00e0 la * manure * fran\u00e7aise in this case . 
  a poignant quote from david mitchell 's ( the author , not the comedian ) * black swan green * :  but you have read madame bovary ? 
   not even hermann hesse ? 
  we do n't really do europeans at school ...  `` europeans '' ? 
  england is now drifted to the caribbean ? 
  are you african ? 
  you are european , you illiterate monkey of puberty !, 
  thomas mann , rilke , gogol !, 
  proust , bulgakov , victor hugo !, 
  this is your culture , your inheritance , your skeleton !, 
  well , he 's a secretary of state for ** foreign ** and commonwealth affairs , so ... 
  * great-grandfather actually . 
  unimpressive indeed . 
  that 's the saddest religious temple i 've ever seen . 
   russian , spanish , dutch and danish ( it even rhymes ! ), 
  common misconception for non-native english speakers , but spanish does n't rhyme with danish . 
  well , spain is still there if the llanitos feel like switching sides . 
  and if london was willing to allow scotland to have an independence referendum , i do n't think they 'll stop gibraltar from having it ( though i believe most gibraltarians are pro-uk and no serious talks about a referendum have been made so far ) . 
  i meant forced vaccination for all children without any drawback ( apart from the obvious one ) . 
  refugees might not even care about sending their kids to greek schools , especially considering most of them are waiting for the first opportunity to move further north in the eu . 
  i do n't think forced vaccinations are a thing in any nation 's law . 
   i swear to god this is the most retarded nation on earth . 
  well , goods and services in denmark are much more expensive , so it sort of balances out . 
  not on a federal level , but over half of the states have adopted english as an official language . 
  personal vehicles ( primarily automobiles ) constitute the vast majority of transport vehicles in big cities . 
  even a 50 % decrease in their numbers will make a huge improvement in the road traffic , air quality , and way of life ( as long as a trustworthy public transit system is in place ) . 
   * best * city to leave . 
   worst city to * live * .

  [ hmm ... ] ( https://dettoldisney.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/hunchback-of-notre-dame-molten-lava.png ), 
  what 's to stop the women from travelling to germany or the czech republic to have the procedure ? 
  it will cost more , but most women who want to go with it would be desperate enough to try it if they can afford it . 
  making abortion fully illegal will only increase the prevalence of `` sketchy '' procedures and moving abroad to have it done . 
  according to the wiki :  in a broader meaning , [ bohemia ] often refers to the entire czech territory , including moravia and czech silesia . 
  plus , you guys call bohemia '' \u010cechy '' , which is directly related to the name `` czech '' . 
  is `` bohemia '' okay ? 
  second pic is straight out of n64 goldeneye . 
   the death of the bison was similar to that of sauron , the 660kg ( 1,455 lb ) male whose decapitated body was found nearly a week earlier at the reserve . 
  could we please be a little more sensitive with those names ? 
  bisons do n't have the cuteness of pandas or the awesomeness of bengal tigers to keep them from going extinct . 
  average people need a little push to be sensitized about the species ' issues . 
  it 's not exactly certain , but a more amicable name might actually help the cause . 
  you 're right . 
  even if president trump ( * chills * ) decides to lay back and bask in his newfound glory , having mike pence calling the shots is n't that reassuring either . 
  does lake balaton count ? 
  it 's part of the plan . 
  the painfully slow exiting negotiations alone will discourage any other member from leaving the union . 
  i find manx very interesting , but its orthography is way too messy . 
  the people who developed it had no knowledge of other gaelic languages making manx sort of what irish gaelic would be if it was spelled like english . 
  also expect higher russian presence in svalbard from now on . 
  for research , of course ... 
  well , yes , but portuguese autumn rains come and go like normal strong rainfall does , but irish rain is like a constant drizzle that sogs up everything and stays for days on end . 
  also , the difference in average precipitation between the two cities is n't that big according to this : [ lisbon ] ( https://weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-precipitation-rainfall,lisbon,portugal ) - [ dublin ] ( https://weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-precipitation-rainfall,dublin,ireland ) . 
  i do n't understand why the swedish government plans to move this city so slowly over time . 
  [ slavutych ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavutych ) was built in a short amount of time to house the people who fled from [ pripyat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pripyat ) after the chernobyl disaster of 1986 . 
  sweden could take its time to plan the new city , build new homes and infrastructure , and move kiruna 's citizens to the new area , but a 2018-2100 plan seems rather ridiculous . 
   bulgaria and romania ~ ~ inch ~ ~ 2.54 cm closer to visa-free travel with canada . 
  this is europe . 
  use your metrics !, 
  well , it 's still dryer than ireland . 
  * any * place is dryer than ireland . 
  the us does n't need to go that far . 
  nato 's manpower and weaponry surpasses russia 's by far . 
  is there anyone who does n't ? 
  i think the cornfields of the mid-west are plagued enough , as well . 
  [ well ... ] ( http://new1.fjcdn.com/pictures/how+aliens+see+the+world_2dbbcd_4350257.jpg ), 
  technically , he said mexico sends all their rapists and thieves to the us . 
  so , the mexican community of his country should be more angry at him than mexico is . 
  at worst , he was willfully deceiving the public . 
  at best , he was an ignorant idiot who had no idea how to rule . 
  religion classes are like an hour-long recess in greek schools .
