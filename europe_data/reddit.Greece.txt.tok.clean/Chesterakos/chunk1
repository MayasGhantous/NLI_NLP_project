the article mentions ** airspace ** but you still have a valid point nonetheless . 
  i 'm glad we still have the courage to keep exposing the bullshit of the media . 
  then suddenly all funding is cut !, 
  they found the crazy guy of the village and suddenly he is the voice of everyone ? 
  sensationalistic journalism at its best . 
  i know this man personally !, 
  he is a very kind and giving soul and one of the oldest bakers in kos !, 
  he is one of the few rich people in the island who cared about the syrian refugees . 
  of course there are other people helping as well but ca n't provide as much as rich guys so they do n't spark any news interest , 
  if the military acts then things will escalate terribly . 
  lesvos , as all the aegean islands near the borders , has great military presence but it 's not the military 's job to contain these people . 
  it 's the non-existant police 's job . 
  something like this happened before . 
  it was called [ junta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_military_junta_of_1967%e2%80%9374 ) and it did n't end well for some people with different mindsets ... 
  every other country in the eu is germany 's little gimp whipping boy . 
  do n't feel bad !, 
  [ hmm . . ] ( http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/093/983/not-sure-if-troll-or-just-very-stupid.jpg ), 
  fucking greece stealing german moneyz ... 
  tell merkel that, 
  on a flight to dublin from greece we had to stop at london to switch planes , i was n't asked for a passport in london . 
  my id was sufficient . 
  come to kos , you 'll see much worse :d, 
  if that is true then golden dawn is to blame . 
  as for the reasons why golden dawn has risen so much in popularity , well i would n't know where to start and where to finish ... ^ ( golden dawn is a neo-nazi extremist party ), 
  a thousand times this !, 
  this is exactly how it goes . 
  what 's more frustrating is that i 've seen quite a few turks spewing bullshit that our coastguard sinks boats and kills people . 
  i ca n't even fathom the propaganda that must be going on in turkish borders right now against greece . 
  ^ ( on the other hand if it serves as a counter-measure towards illegal immigration then so be it ... ), 
  this is true . 
  we have been getting illegal immigrants from turkey since ages but they would n't surpass the 400 mark for a whole summer . 
  now the situation is beyond measure . 
  400 is a slow ** day ** . 
  will do !, 
  hold my ouzo !, 
  it 's true !, 
  ^ ( but we have no money to build such factory :( ), 
  thank you for appointing me the prime minister of greece !, 
  it is a dream come true !, 
  joke aside , we hold what we can hold and the rest gets pushed . 
  who would want to stay in greece anyway ? 
  the minute they step on greek soil they scream for their papers to go to germany !, 
  hell even i am considering going to germany now !, 
  wait wait ... so you 're saying that by pointing out the cynical ( which everyone says it 's not and only you insist ) you are the one pointing out the positive ? 
  your self-righteousness has hit an all-time high my friend !, 
  dear europe , send us more tents because they are selling like crazy here !, 
  thanks illegal immigrants !, 
  noone said that it was wrong of her for offering . 
  / u/whereworm just pointed out the obvious and you as the white knight popped up to put a nameplate on him as cynical and all this crap . 
  take a look at yourself in the mirror buddy . 
  you 're one of them though are n't you ? 
  making comments and such ... 
  greek islander here , prepare yourselves for a sheer flood of immigrants !, 
  we have plenty to send you everyday !, 
  ships upon ships , 
  is that santorini or astypalaia ? 
  i 'm always confused ... 
  this sub is anti-anything, 
  i guess you do n't like greece, 
  the influx of illegal immigrants has n't declined at all since the start of the summer . 
  on the contrary , it had been greatly increased and kos gets on average 500 illegal immigrants everyday . 
  you ca n't enter foreign waters nonchalantly, 
  once they see you coming they automagically destroy their boat so you * have to rescue them *, 
  they are sinking their own boats to be rescued and carried over to the eu nation they are trying to get to . 
  you can squeeze the bag all you want but nothing will pop out if the bag is empty . 
  the course of this submission can give out so many conclusions about this sub 's attitude towards greece-related submissions ... 
  it would be far more suiting to put some pigs instead of a goat ... 
  you and / u/rickdg are describing greece now ... 
  at least some cities did it right , [ kos , greece ] ( http://www.kos.gr/en/activities/sitepages/view.aspx?nid=12 ), 
  it does , yet i needed to express it again just for those who might think that all you need is a tourism licence and nothing more . 
  if other countries keep sending them their pensions then sure !, 
  bring them all here !, 
  yet they continue to lend us money . 
  they must be idiots , right ? 
  that `` self-employment '' tax that you so casually say is a whopping 29 % on your net profits . 
  you 're forgetting the fact that they need to found their own legal entity and pay the monthly taxes for the existence of this legal entity also . 
  a person can not issue receipts or invoices if he does n't have his own legal entity 's vat number . 
  the monthly costs for the existence of such legal entity starts from 100 euros and goes upwards . 
  i work in it in greece . 
  at the moment it 's pretty much impossible . 
  we are breathing our last breaths and then we 'll close or move to another country . 
  and we 'll pay them back when they give us more money to pay that one back and more money to pay the other one back and and and and and and ... pay pay pay loan loan loan ** error ** ** error ** ** error **, 
  while your reasoning is sound , you have to take under consideration that parties are funded by the same people who , if they are audited , will mostly be thrown in jail and lose everything . 
  nevertheless , i am of the same opinion as you and i would very much enjoy it if i saw such restructuring . 
  the first thing that comes to mind is that the tax collection offices around the country are severely understaffed and in cases of small societies they are in the same loop of having good relations rather than imposing fines , collecting them and losing face . 
  tax collection agencies need some strong restructuring but the governments are too weak to do that . 
  the political cost for them can be quite high . 
  it 's worse than that . 
  we do n't ask for receipts and yet we pay the full price , taxes included , which goes entirely to the shop-owners pocket . 
  the reasoning on the client 's side is that in a small society having good relations is of greater importance than forcing them to issue a receipt . 
  the reasoning on the shop-owners side is that , as they say , in order to be competitive they keep their prices low and count on not having to issue receipts most of the time to get a marginal profit . 
  they say that if they do issue a receipt they are automatically at a loss . 
  alright thanks for the sources . 
  i can not comment on the german sources as i do not know german this good . 
  my comment on the economist source is that it describes nicely the reasons why germany could lead europe but it does not say that germany 's reluctance is criticized by third parties . 
  generally though i am not in favor of a single country leading a union . 
  in that case it is more of a federation rather than a union . 
  that 's so true !, 
  it 's almost ironic !, 
  could you give us a source which describes the criticism for germany 's decision not to take leading role in europe ?
