  i am a person who loves reading news about europe and i can honestly say i did n't stumble to any such article anywhere . 
  this quote can be a good start for an anecdote !, 
  we 've had worse ... 
  they want to steal our show with a spectacular italexit ... dem italians man ... 
  meh it 's not being cynic believing that irrational people exist ... 
  and i 'm telling you 2009 and 2010 is the ** start ** . 
  i have no problem acknowledging anything . 
  i said that the logistics were discovered before the austerity and since late 2009 , start of 2010 is the ** start ** then what i said is true . 
  should i start arguing now that 1 +1 equals 2 ? 
  they did make use of it . 
  noone gave a shit because it 's so obvious as the sky is blue . 
  propaganda did n't help tsipras and varoufakis at all . 
  they even won a referendum with 63 % and still did n't do shit with it . 
  it 's not greek politics . 
  we asked to cut spending on the military and germany straightforward disagreed . 
  plain and simple . 
  mate why are you so mad ? 
  of course i can read a wikipedia article and 2015 minus 6 years is 2009 . 
  your point is that 2009 is n't the start of the austerity measures ? 
  germans want us to spend more on military because we buy everything from them and we still end up owing them the same money . 
  guess who has a win/win scenario !, 
  late 2009 is before the shitstorm started . 
  is this a counter argument ? 
  you are just re-enforcing my original argument . 
  what do you mean by that ? 
  this was discovered before the 6 years of austerity . 
  get your facts straight . 
  ideologically the eu has transformed from a union of unity to a union of creditors and debtors . 
  not much different from a bank and a client . 
  at the moment in greece even if you are a bum living on the street earning nothing , you still are accountable for what is known as `` mandatory income of survival '' on which you are taxed !, 
  there seriously is a `` subscription fee '' just for being greek . 
  oh and to elaborate on your example , if i earn 8000 euros per year and i spend almost all of it just to pay the bills and then i get asked to pay significant amount of it in taxes , where can i get that money to pay ? 
  it 's simple . 
  the tax is disproportionate to the cost of living and i 'm not talking about a luxurious life at all . 
  can you blame them ? 
  a lot of masks have been dropped this week . 
  we do n't kill them and we respect human rights within our means of doing so . 
  they 'll send them back the same way they sent them here in the first place . 
  the more i think about it the more i tend to believe that tsipras hoped for a yes in the referendum to escape this hell and blame it to the people . 
  now he has managed to be the ultimate failure with the exception of showing to the world the true face of europe and who really calls the shots within this so-called `` union '' . 
  oh no do n't worry !, 
  we 'll be in the spotlight in a short while again !, 
  we just ca n't have enough of it !, 
  we 'll always be called lazy tax-evading cunts . 
  you can be sure at least about that !, 
  no matter what we vote or what our majority says or does . 
  they will ignore the people for the time being and you 'll see the opposition voting in favor . 
  dark times for democracy right in the cradle of it . 
  i 'm pretty sure that there wo n't be one single party to form a government in greece for a long while yet . 
  coalition governments will still be needed even though the current election system is actively designed to suppress the rise of such governments !, 
  we had to destroy a couple of banks to construct it by using the wood of the offices . 
  fear the danaans ( ancient greek tribe ) bearing gifts . 
  i 'm sorry i did n't know that . 
  i 'll correct my previous statement . 
  i very much agree with you . 
  twitter is a political game and every tweet is measured to the fullest . 
  he will still held responsible for any outcome . 
  besides , he said it was a necessary move and he is still part of the plan . 
  ~ ~ a minor correction , varoufakis is not elected . 
  he was chosen as finance minister from tsipras . ~ ~ nevertheless , i still think that an official being outed this way is not democratic but we have to take under consideration that it may be a crucial move from tsipras for a better deal , who is in fact elected and has the people 's voice with him . 
  which in and of itself is ridiculous . 
  if recognized academics such as varoufakis , and noone can say that the man does n't have the background to be recognized as such , do n't get a say to events that can turn the course of financial history then i 'm afraid our lucks are left to either ignorant megalomaniacs or a bunch of vultures . 
  quick !, 
  stuff them in the mattress !, 
  i do n't get you . 
  do you mean that incompetence ( which is your opinion btw ) is worse than starting world wars ? 
  every time i see this photo of tsipras and merkel i ca n't help but picture mr. bean in place of tsipras . 
  if german politicians still go with the `` lazy greeks '' motto then there 's nothing you can do about them . 
  you ca n't argue with idiots . 
  are you the creator of these images ? 
  all of it is history , thanks for the lesson, 
  an ** impossible ** task . 
  ftfy, 
  our future ^ ( and present ) is `` grey '' . 
  how could they do that then without having the majority ? 
  bavarians now are the germans , right ? 
  or is it all of the nations which speak german ? 
  my history/geography knowledge lacks on that front . 
  even though potami does n't have a great reputation amongst a lot of people because of its leader , i 'll give you the benefit of doubt that they would n't mess things up too . 
  the question though remains , what did you vote before the previous elections ? 
  before potami ? 
  or are you 18/19 ? 
  i 'm sorry for my friends in cyprus for what 's to come because of us . 
  ehhh no . 
  what he said is that portugal will most probably default as well right after greece exits the ez . 
  by then greece will have done everything you said again , only on drachmas . 
  could you tell us which ones you would elect ? 
  because as far as i know all that was left is either the communism party or the golden dawn party . 
  are you with one of them ? 
  which one ? 
  whatever it was , it appears that now they do n't need it as much . 
  which begs the question , does anyone working in imf pay taxes ? 
  defaulting is definitely not a new start . 
  the debts are n't magically erased . 
  v for venus ? 
  it 's about time we go there too !, 
  the difference between swedish people paying vat and greek people paying vat ** nowadays ** is that greek people get shitty public services back in contrast to swedish public services . 
  this leads them towards not trusting the government with their money . 
  greek government officials have been corrupt a loooooong time now and i would be glad if europe officials help us throw them in the sea with a stone around their necks because apparently we ca n't do it on our own . 
  ... corruption ... everywhere ...
