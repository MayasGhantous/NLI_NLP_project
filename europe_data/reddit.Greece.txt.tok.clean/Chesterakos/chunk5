  damn you brits !, 
  this is our time to shine !, 
  not yours !, 
  one day is that and the next day is the other and there we go again ... it 's a vicious never-ending circle . 
  the tweet inside the article is a proof of ignorance . 
  every 25th of march greece celebrates its freedom from the 400 years turkish occupation with exactly that military march in the center of athens . 
  it has absofuckinlutely _ nothing _ to do with syriza . 
  what would the drones do ? 
  sink the boats ? 
  they do n't run away from the authorities when they reach the shore . 
  they go straight to them for food and shelter !, 
  i know that as of this moment there are more than 150 immigrants in and around our police station in my town waiting to be sent to piraeus , athens and then to god knows where . 
  this is a prime example of how an uneducated judge regarding it matters can potentially affect millions . 
  although erdogan did it once already in the past with twitter and he is still in power so ... wtf turkish people ? 
  vote this guy out of there already !, 
  are you talking about erdogan 's recent scandal that got leaked through twitter ? 
  nah , pirates and smugglers are bff ... 
  at least they can fortify themselves with walls and it 's completely understandable . 
  what can we do since most of our frontiers are sea ? 
  voldy ... hehe  he does have a resemblance although he smiles a lot despite of the original voldy :p, 
  i live on an island of greece which is part of the frontier with turkey . 
  _ every day _ we get an average of 50 immigrants coming from turkey and originating from various countries like iran , iraq , syria and the likes ... 
  it is a ** real ** problem and i hope the eu does something about it soon because these people ca n't be hold prisoners forever . 
  edit : i know my comment is not about the british . 
  i wish we only had british immigrants . 
  it is the other way around in that aspect i 'm afraid . 
  a vast majority of greeks know at least two languages . 
  if you happen to visit one of the islands especially then there 's no chance you 'll encounter a person without at least knowing english . 
  apart from japanese , all the other languages you said are latin-based and have a lot of similarities . 
  greek though is as different as japanese is compared to them . 
  in fact german grammar is similar to ancient greek in many aspects . 
  in fact german grammar is similar to ancient greek in many aspects . 
  do n't bother answering to that guy . 
  he is spewing anti-greek hate at every greece-related thread in / r/europe . 
  ignore him completely . 
  you are fighting a lost battle . 
  i have already quit trying to prove in here that the sky is blue . 
  siemens has been throwing bribes left and right here in greece . 
  this history goes back to the greek junta !, 
  everyone is welcome !, 
  i 'm bringing the souvlakia you bring the ouzos !, 
  ^ ( most cliche greek answer ever ), 
  can a fellow german please explain to me where is the joke here and why did they laugh about it ? 
  _ honestly _ i ca n't figure it out . 
  to be frank , i have no idea who this guy is but he must be terrible at making music :p, 
   those losers thanks for that !, 
  i 'm not so sure about that ... 
  thank you  you are very kind , 
  it 's not a norm here in greece for men to shave their armpits . 
  in fact it is expected of them to at least have hair there if not anywhere else . 
  if we start getting such photos from the internet we will never end . 
  that does n't invalidate my original statement of course . 
   top-selling tabloid newspaper bild has run a campaign against further financial aid to greece , which included a huge ` nein ' to bailout extensions on the front page in february . 
  this has been widely credited with helping sour the public mood . 
  bild has been milking the whole debacle all these years so much !, 
  no wonder this many german citizens feel like this . 
  it looks like a cabin in a boat !, 
  i saw your deleted comment dude `` why do n't you go and pay your taxes '' . 
  i ca n't deal with blind hateful people like you . 
  one has only to read some comments from your history and know how hateful you are . 
  i 'm never going to respond to you ever again . 
  you are terribly misinformed and biased . 
  well hi there yaix !, 
  do n't worry we all know that you would n't trust a greek to even give you water if you were dying . 
  keep on hating !, 
   . . nazi + communist government in greece . . are you serious ? 
  [ been there , done that ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-12/ecb-said-to-increase-greek-ela-ceiling-by-600-million-euros ) ^ ^ why ^ ^ the ^ ^ downvotes ? 
  ^ ^ did ^ ^ i ^ ^ say ^ ^ something ^ ^ wrong ? 
  about greece not being a developed country read [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ynn0x/greece_warns_that_it_may_begin_confiscating/cpba99k ) ^ ^ this ^ ^ is ^ ^ getting ^ ^ old ^ ^ and ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ tired ^ ^ of ^ ^ it ministers , as everyone else , have the right to express their opinions in any democracy . 
  this does not mean that what he says will become reality . 
  1 -  the reparations was and still is one man 's opinion and not the government 's as a whole . 
  also it was about the german government 's properties and not those of german citizens . 
  there are so many things wrong in that article ... 2 -  i ca n't understand what you 're saying . 
  anyway the justice courts will judge that . 
  not the governments . 
  3 -  stupid media are stupid . 
  4 -  ca n't happen . 
  no law for it . 
  if we default on our debts , we will default on the imf loans too so that 's that . 
  the support you are talking about will be in the form of pressure to sell everything in the country in a firesale . 
  so imagine a bunch of vultures on a dead body ... 
   please get your shit together . 
  who are you referring to ? 
  varoufakis says what everyone believes already . 
  that greece ca n't keep on like that anymore . 
  rich people have transfered all their riches in off-shore companies or in switzerland or god knows where and the rest of the people , who are poor , just do n't have any more money left to pay . 
  i am working my ass off everyday , earning 700 euros per month and i barely get by with just utility bills , rent and gas . 
  i pay all my taxes in full . 
  i am a prime example of the middle class of greece at the moment believe it or not . 
  you can hang me upside down and you 'll get absolutely zero money left to give you . 
  ^ ^ if ^ ^ only ^ ^ those ^ ^ loans ^ ^ we ^ ^ have ^ ^ been ^ ^ getting ^ ^ went ^ ^ to ^ ^ the ^ ^ people ^ ^ and ^ ^ not ^ ^ to ^ ^ the ^ ^ failed ^ ^ banks ... 
  most of the people already knew that when they voted for them . 
  but the previous government ( s ) was in any way imaginable horrible people as a whole . 
  they are to blame for lots of things . 
  at least i did n't vote for them ever but one vote ca n't change a lot ... to be honest i think we have come to an impasse regarding our future within the eurozone and it 's common currency . 
  there 's just no way for things to be changed anytime soon if the same fiscal policy is enforced . 
  we must leave euro as a currency , default on our debts and start over if we want to have any chance for a better future . 
  there are virtually none products that follow inelastic demand in greece . 
  although the same can be said for a lot of countries . 
  greece is incredibly competitive on the touristic sector but it 's just not enough .
