  seriously dude you are seeing demons everywhere ... 
  something that is not mentioned in the article but should be , is that the greek state 's 55 % is managed by a third party in canada if i 'm correct . 
  here 's the source http://www.thepressproject.net/article/67522/how-much-did-the-hochtief-managed-athens-airport-dodge-in-taxes--12-150-or-600-million a quote from the article which made me lol !, 
   germany 's biggest construction company hochtief was also the biggest tax evader in greece , a greek court reportedly ruled last week . 
  it seems that this land is inviting to everyone in the world who wants to tax evade !, 
  ok enough with the laugh ... now to start crying ... 
  the people that ruined my country are not in power anymore . 
  and i 'm only defending my fellow greeks who have dreams and want to get out of this financial depression that they inherited . 
  i am a young greek and i too inherited this depression . 
  this was not of my doing . 
  you can bash greeks all you want but know that you appear to be terribly misinformed . 
  did n't i just write that we waited for the previous government to get their shit together ? 
  they did n't do all the things you said and that 's why we gave them the boot . 
  ironically though they were the loved ones from the european side because they were the yes-men . 
  the article is sensationalistic and twisted . 
  if there is one thing i would get out of the whole article is that if greece leaves the eu , then those immigrants will leave greece to go to richer countries . 
  that 's a fact noone can deny . 
  and there will be noone in greece to stop them . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong but i think the ** sum ** of the salary is what matters and not actually how many salaries you get per year . 
  the sum was not above average european levels . 
  now it is under . 
  far under . 
  like the bottom of the barrel under . 
  source ? 
  those were the years ... 
  i want those years back ... 
  without this future though !, 
  greece has suffered strict austerity from 2008 until now . 
  that 's ** 7 years of austerity ** . 
  lots of people have commited suicide because they ended up on the street with their families . 
  common folk were promised by the previous governments that there is a light at the end of the tunnel ... we waited and waited but things only got worse . 
  then a big percentage of the votes gave rise to spiteful right-radical parties like golden dawn who are really really terrible and the only reason they have this many votes is just from rage by the common folk who suffered the blows . 
  the leftist party , syriza , which is the government now , promised justice against the previous government and meaningful reforms . 
  who would you vote if you were in such a position ? 
  the same people who promised false hopes for 7 years and they were the ones who led you in such a position in the first place ? 
  if you are given shit and death as the only two options . 
  you choose the shit . 
  op , what do you think about greeks ? 
  despite that , they are free to tell whatever they want . 
  it 's a democracy after all and we should know a thing or two about that ... on the account of passing it as a law ... well that 's a completely different fruit . 
  at least you have your exports of basketball players !, 
  thanks for those btw !, 
  they helped panathinaikos win quite a lot of euroleagues !, 
  you must have your stomach checked by a doctor if a reddit comment can upset it . 
  that 's precious coming from a turk . 
  you 'd really love to dance on our graves , do n't you ? 
  i could n't have expressed it any better . 
  thank you . 
  piigs ... they could n't come up with another acronym ? 
  anyway ... 
  so you 're saying it 's really an unofficial charge against portugal italy ireland greece and spain lead by germany and the rest of the northern countries ? 
  now that 's a sincere european sentiment right there . 
  should i point out that the journalist chose the goethe institute for clickbaiting ? 
  no official has made any suggestion as to the goethe institute per se . 
  turkey occupied greece for 400 years . 
  maybe we should ask them too for money !, 
  we wo n't be the happiest nation on the planet but we will be happy to release the millions of illegal immigrants that we are bound to keep from leaving by the schengen agreement . 
  i do n't know after that how much happier the rest of the eu will be , 
  the anti-greek movement is strong in this thread . 
  we had social welfare support before the austerity measures . 
  voted by germany too among others . 
  greece 's freedom of press index : [ good ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/press_freedom_index ) corruption index : [ same as all south eu ] ( http://www.transparency.org/cpi2014/results ) gdp : [ ranked 44 out of 187 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28ppp%29_per_capita ) social welfare : [ ranked 33 just below italy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_sen_social_welfare_function ) i did my math and i have proven you wrong with sources . 
  now you do yours . 
  tell that to the millions of germans who have already booked their holidays in greece . 
  thank god there are still people not so narrow-minded . 
  is there a national standard that determines if a country is developed or not ? 
  who are you to say that greece is not a developed country ? 
  threats for veto in the european council happen all the time almost every day for various matters small and large yet you just single out those that fit your argument . 
  if greece is not up to par with some of the other bigger eu countries it 's a matter of surviving so many wars and trying to defend your european borders . 
  lend greece your army so we can have enough to invest on other sectors that would help us develop faster and then we 'll talk . 
  ** edit : ** ~ ~ let the downvotes rain down . 
  i have nothing to fear because i 'm telling the truth . ~ ~ ** edit 2 : ** someone 's stomach was upset because of the above edit so i 'm erasing it , the reddit way ... 
  not really . 
  this is just fireworks . 
  germany is vilified in every country in the eu . 
  not just in greece . 
  it 's all work of the media and the governments involved . 
  also i 'm pretty sure your media has done the exact same thing for german people to hate everyone else . 
  now you 're just being mean ... 
  please ? 
  please do . 
  it would make things a lot more clearer . 
  what 's the point of this post ? 
  i just stole your witty comment !, 
  see here , https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2yfd7v/tactical_jesus_delivery/ i hope you do n't mind !, 
  they can take all our moniez but they ca n't take our awesome sun and sea :p, 
  that statement is true because greece is not sick . 
  greece is dead and we 're just beating the corpse around . 
  this government is an actual joke . 
  i 'm sorry that we have so many stupid people who fell for their trolling promises before the elections . 
  we should n't have invented democracy ... 
  what long term ? 
  eu is getting worse and worse by the minute . 
  i 'm not sure that we 'll see the actual event though . 
  self-awareness is the first step to improvement, 
  ... and it 's not the least bit surprising . 
  rules are made by the rich for the rich . 
  i did answer your question . 
  you 're just fishing for bait statements . 
  here 's one then , the police must do what is needed in order to keep the peace .
