  if that 's teargassing then so be it . 
  so it 's better to have disorder and anarchy ? 
  greece should do the same as fyrom does . 
  they should have been applying for asylum on the first peaceful country which is turkey or jordania . 
  i completely support your police . 
  if only our incompetent idiots did the same ... 
  with all those bombings ? 
  they can keep it !, 
  i wish your answer was the top comment . 
  we are in war with the imf and the eu . 
  you 're correct !, 
  we have . 
  they 're called hot spots . 
  we went as far as to propose `` northern macedonia '' but that was n't accepted either . 
  las vegas has an eiffel tower and a pyramid , i guess they have the right to be called france , egypt and usa ** all at the same time !, 
  how about next time you only speak for yourself ? 
  i confirm that everything he said is the absolute truth . 
  dem athenians where wise besides from boylovers ;p, 
  you do n't understand why turkey wants to empty their lands of immigrants ? 
  what ? 
  turkey is n't accepting anyone . 
  fyrom is first and foremost protecting itself by closing the borders . 
  all the others are just sweet sidelines which fyrom of course would take advantage of . 
  when i was a soldier serving at the borders of greece the army provided beds which were dated from back in the 50s and everything in the army camp was dated as fuck . 
  it was like a blast from the past but not in a good way . 
  i had to live in those conditions for a whole year while serving my duty to my country . 
  amygdaleza did n't close because of what you said . 
  amygdaleza closed because tsipras is a fucking moron and everything he does backfires and we the greeks have to pay for it . 
   `` i had such hopes for ( german chancellor ) angela merkel . '', 
  he pronounces the chancellor 's name like the english word `` angel . '', 
  well there you have it mother merkel !, 
  for greece yes it would be but the rest of the eu would love it since they would n't have to care about us anymore . 
  in other news the sky is blue . 
  seriously these news are n't even news anymore ... 
  is there a country in the whole world that has n't violated human rights ? 
  i do n't know what greece did to violate them but it 's not so difficult for me to take it as a fact knowing that the human rights laws are impossible not to be violated in times such as these . 
  at least now i get to ask the nobel committee to pay my bills , 
  i live in one of the islands which get the rubber dingies daily , our tourism is pretty much destroyed . 
  the worst part is that there is n't a candidate government in the horizon that could at least help bring us out of this mess . 
  if you take a look at the parliament at its current standing , they are all imbeciles . 
  has n't ireland just managed to get rid of the imf ? 
  how is it rich already ? 
  in my experience actual syrian refugees can pass the borders . 
  it 's the other ones who ca n't and , in my opinion , should n't . 
  it 's always against the governments . 
  it 's the only thing we ca n't sell ... 
  can you name one except turkey ? 
  why would their countries of origin accept them back ? 
  europe has no leverage over them . 
  take a chill pill or a frappe or a gyros ... just chill, 
  and in kos, 
  i 'm sold !, 
  fire up the grill !, 
  even i do n't want to live in greece anymore !, 
  imagine them !, 
  that 'll teach them for talking shit about the sultan !, 
  i do n't get it, 
  well this kos is a beautiful island actually ... 
  like you helped greece ? 
  i could n't have said it better myself !, 
  the eu has shown its true face and it keeps on showing it left and right ... 
  it may be `` precious '' coming from a greek but eu has become ( or maybe has always been ) a bunch of hypocrites . 
  it 's like they do n't want us in the eu and we try our damnest , kicking and screaming , to stay in !, 
  as a greek living on one of those islands , i do not want to see your scenario come to life . 
  if it does , rip me ... 
  what ? 
  can someone recreate this in a google sheet translated ? 
  well then i must be blind then or leaving in a different country than greece because it sure as hell does n't seem this way on the island where i live . 
  when the same article has the man of interest eating from his girlfriend 's back as a table , it does hurt his credibility a tiny bit ... just a tiny bit ... 
  [ there are a lot of variations but this is the base of them all . 
  ] ( http://diakonima.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/coat_of_arms_of_greece.png ), 
  that 's true . 
  i wonder the same thing ... 
   greece has paralyzed the union for 5 years . 
  enough is enough . 
  you might want to step back a little and gain some perspective . 
  i wish i could answer with certainty that greece can choose to deploy them wherever greece wants but unfortunately i ca n't . 
  instead i ask myself , if the answer was yes and greece had indeed the liberty to use the guards in whichever way it pleases them then why not accept them right off the bat ? 
  what i previously said is not official by any means but is certainly backtalk amongst government officials and other people close to the ruling party . 
  euro 's credibility is already in question . 
  if greece drops out of the eurozone then the euro 's credibility goes down with it . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong but if the scenario was n't that then why bother with all those loans in the first place ... 
  leaving the comment on the scapegoating aside , as i see everyone already realises it , the european commission does not realise that the immigrants one way or another will find a way north . 
  they wo n't stay here . 
  they do n't want to stay here . 
  they give 0 fucks about greece . 
  a big hit in our only profitable section , tourism . 
  the belief is that the agents sent from europe to `` guard borders '' were meant to actually not let the immigrants leave greece and travel north . 
  all in all , glorified prison guards . 
  i read about the threats . 
  what i do n't read is suggestions on safeguarding maritime borders . 
  should we just let them drown when they enter our borders and sink their boats ? 
  that 's what they do once they see patrols . 
  ionians is a far older root than romans so it stuck . 
  most of those islands are major touristic destinations . 
  so , no ... 
  millions of phds ? 
  so , sauron is polish !, 
  you 're implying that germany is not the eu ?
