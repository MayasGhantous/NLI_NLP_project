deleted ? 
  are there have any recent polls on how such a vote would turn out ? 
  dude , are you on somebody 's payroll ? 
  i see you in all threads about this , saying he confirmed it while he clearly denied all this . 
  you 're confronted by various people on this and yet continue saying he confirmed it ... anyway [ link . 
  the high visibility parts of the balkans overlap with some of our biggest mountain ranges , the dinaric alps . 
  the greek part is mostly pindos , a huge mountain range that starts in albania and comes south to greece . 
  the mountainous terrain continues through peloponnese , crete and rhodes until it merges with the taurus mountains in turkey . 
  and i still remember geography apparently . 
  i 'm too old for this shit it seems ... 
  but you told me above that he confirmed it !, 
  are you insane ? 
  oh i ca n't read the article because it says i reached my 10 article a month limit ( google trick does n't work ) . 
  i read the original of kathimerini though . 
  and i found [ this ] ( https://twitter.com/yanisvaroufakis/status/625336067831558144 ) . 
  source please ? 
  edit : he actually denied this . 
  nice misinformation man !, 
  [ link . 
  the way you know this is probably bullshit is that he was our ** finance minister ** . 
  he would n't need to hack the tax registry numbers because the finance ministry already has ** every single one of them because they create and manage the damn things ** . 
  also , he had the authority to order both the ministry and the greek banks to do as he would like , without need for hacking and other such b/s . 
  they just mention hacking because it sounds arcane , thus scary to the average pensioner . 
  this story was crated by the greek conservetive newspaper kathimerini and personally i think it 's just continuation of the scaremongering propaganda we 've been force-fed for quite some time now . 
  well i 'm in lesvos right now ( a huge entry point for syrian refugees ) and as far as i can tell , everybody who is caught by the coast guard or any other authority really , is `` registered '' and checked by doctors . 
  there are 2 huge problems with this though . 
  firstly , these people do n't have any papers , identification , medical record etc. 
  so what can they register really ? 
  secondly , there are so many of them that the doctors are not enough , there is no place for them to sleep , and there is not even enough food to feed those that do reach shelters and check points let alone all of them . 
  so to answer your question , anybody that wants to continue can not be stopped because there is nobody available to stop them . 
  think about it , just from the start of this year there was half a million of them . 
  if you think we have the coast guard or the police force to stop and process half a million people after 5 years of economic collapse , think again . 
   many of my friends agree . 
  so why has n't it been done ? 
  it 's because you have n't reached a consensus up to now !, 
  i 've called tsipras and while he sounded a bit shocked at first , he understood how serious this was . 
  he set the date of exit sometime this week with a [ hard deadline next sunday at 23:59 ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=greek+deadline ) . 
  he also informed me that he 'll come on national tv this evening , to inform the greek people of your decision . 
  thank you for your time sir , we 'll be out of your hair in no time !, 
  well you do have a point there . 
  it 's just that the left is supposed to be more about farmers , workers , equality and not about helping crate a huge parasitic oligarchy that thinks paying taxes is a joke . 
  not pasok though . 
  they care as much for the working class as they care for shit on their shoes . 
  they were more like a mob family , taking care of their own loyalists etc. 
  but with a left wing rhetoric . 
  dude , calm down . 
  if shauble hears he 'll send to kidnap the goats for ransom . 
  a little googling shows the root of the word is \u0391\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u03af\u03b1 meaning heroism , manly virtue in greek . 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euyubmuswkc ), 
  does n't matter really . 
  it 's unsustainable with our current economy and the cuts would have to be done deal or no deal . 
  oh baby you 're in for a ride if you thing 30 % is the cap . 
  let 's just say it 'll get worse till it gets better . 
  if it gets better . 
   locked in a safe just steps from jean-claude juncker 's office is said to be a confidential document drawn up by european commission staffers on how to deal with greece 's exit from the eurozone . 
  along with his booze and his `` i \u2665 greece '' t-shirt ? 
  that 's why they were given to us . 
  we get new loans to pay the old loans , and the circle of endless dept goes on . 
  as things stand , sisyphus has better chances than us . 
  if this shit goes on for a couple of years more , we 're gon na be as hated as best korea . 
   krugman suggested that the ruling radical syriza party staged the showdown without having a plan b -- `` at least something they could hold up , ` this is what we will do if we ca n't get any new cash . ' '', 
  but they had a plan b. 
  not a very good one , or exactly legal , but they had one . 
  i think krugman is just cutting his losses . 
  and as we say where \u0399 'm from '' \u0391\u03c0 ' \u03ad\u03be\u03c9 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf \u03c7\u03bf\u03c1\u03cc , \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03cd\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bb\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5 '' meaning that people whose ass is n't on the line , always have many suggestions . 
  do n't try to compare mediterranean summer with your humid hell . 
  dude , please format that `` thing '' if you anybody to read it . 
  we were always pro-eu as far as i can remember . 
  i do n't know about pro-euro though . 
  are we fucking cursed ? 
  it seems nothing good happens here anymore . 
  there was also a plan to get karamanlis assassinated , called [ pythia ] ( http://www.wikileaks-forum.com/anything-and-everything/8/greece-plan-pythia-1and8243-for-assassinating-pm-karamanlis/8990/ ) . 
  certainly . 
  a firefighter on tv said that one of the fires had multiple sources and that it started at 4am . 
  yeah , i think that 's him . 
  is his party in poland far-right ? 
  i hope so . 
  we wasted 5 months of politicians hiding behind the eurogroup claiming the issue was just economics , while it was and still is political . 
  oh and that reminds me , you know what i really miss ? 
  another eurogroup with president goldilocks crazy-curls . 
  only if we start with the golden dawn though . 
  greece tall !, 
  no , not yet . 
  there are talks that the banks will open come monday , but nobody knows for sure . 
  capital controls are here to stay though . 
  the reason that nobody is allowed ( excluding proper autorities that are completely understaffed to handle the volume ) to help them , is that traffickers also claim to just help them . 
  so the criminals that cause this mess also spoil it for everybody involved . 
  source : am from mytilini , lesvos . 
  that face can spoil milk in a sealed carton . 
  if you think 25 % + unemployment and skyrocketing of public dept in greece , spain and portugal is improvement , i dread to see your defintion of failure . 
  is this serious ? 
  so someone will come on tv one day and tell the 25 % percent of the greek population and 60 % of the the youth that are seeing their futures being destroyed before their eyes that their voting rights are suspended . 
  do you know how revolutions start ? 
  please do n't give kammenos any ideas . 
  218 mps are 20 % of your parliament ? 
  edit : wow 945 seats !, 
  bill has 151 votes so far so it passes . 
  thanks obama . 
  send many monies !, 
  every hope and/or dream we greeks may have for this country , is immediately crushed when we watch our monkeys fling shit shamelessly at each other , thinking we do n't have the memory to remember their past actions or the brain to see through their lies .
