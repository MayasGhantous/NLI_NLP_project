what 's the point of posting this ? 
  we can all find ridiculous reports and biased news sites , post them here , and then circlejerk in the comment section . 
  should n't we be posting reputable and trustworthy news reports that rightfully criticize russia , instead of articles that are closer to trolling than journalism ? 
  the latter is easy . 
  this is just a shitpost . 
  looks like you 're right .

  * pollution & enviroment : 14 % * : bullshit . 
  if greek people cared and thought of ` pollution & environment ' as the greatest threat to the world , they would n't pollute the fucking environment . 
  * ( though for some reason , when people think of '' pollution and enviroment '' , they 're thinking of a great environmental disaster , not the polluting of individuals , which i 'm going to rant about ) * . 
  you 've got 25 y.o. 
  greeks with a more-than-decent secondary education and a great tertiary education , who honestly ca n't comprehend the fact that polluting is bad . 
  i 'm not talking about people who are simply irresponsible or indifferent , i 'm talking about people who ca n't ** understand ** why tossing garbage out of your car window is wrong . 
  because nobody , ever , at home or at school , taught them that . 
  so i wish that next time people stop being pretentious shits when answering to these surveys . 
  ehhh , 3 times bigger than buckingham , 20 times uglier too . 
  i also liked [ this one ] ( http://galeria.cdn.index.hu/belfold/2014/10/26/nemet_mondtak_a_netadora/7051513_dc84cd90317385592d448e4d55d3f227_m.jpg ) , which apparently is from yesterday 's protest in budapest . 
  ** italians ** : i like them so much i pretend the greco-italian war never happened . 
  ** french ** : when i hear '' europe '' , i think france . 
  a truly magnificent , impressive culture and a glorious history . 
  ** english ** : the stereotype about you is that you 're distant , phlegmatic people . 
  brits who visit here have proven that this is not the case . 
  ** very ** approachable , easy-going folk . 
  it 's ( mostly ) easy to get to know them , very open-minded imo !, 
  yes , that 's true !, 
  in greek it 's leukorussia [ leuko + russia ] leuko means '' white '' in greek , and since we 're on the subject of language , this is why the term '' leukemia '' was coined too . 
  leukemia results in high numbers of abnormal white blood cells , so it 's * leukemia * [ leuko ( white ) + hema ( blood ) ] . 
  sorry if i bored you . 
  well yes ... same kind of circlejerk and same amount of retardation . 
  dae hate this orwellian nightmare ? '', 
  [ circlejerk ] but omg those ignorant russkies are so brainwashed and delusional !!, 
  i never thought i 'd say this , but for once , upon googling something i came up with positive results about greece . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/circus#controversy ( last paragraph )  greece became the first european country to ban any animal from performing in any circus in its territory in february 2012 , following a campaign by animal defenders international and the greek animal welfare fund ( gawf ) . 
  second to last paragraph lists all countries that have implemented a nationwide ban on using * some if not all * animals in circuses . 
  - even + ( ing ) - ~ ~ is ~ ~ in autumn i want to smoke what op is smoking :d, 
  ah , good ol' british tourists . 
  when they 're not damaging their livers in a bar or puking and pissing in public , they 're trying to off themselves either by drowning in the sea while drunk , or taking dives from a hotel balcony . 
  in which case did the nurses share meals with the patients ? 
  spain , usa or elsewhere ? 
  link me to an article please because i ca n't find any !, 
  how many hours is the flight athens --  reykjavik ? 
  i 've packed my blankets , my sweaters , my scarf and a * learn icelandic in 4 months * paperback . 
  i know they 're not exactly sports , but in greece it goes like this : ** 1 . 
  ** sports betting ** 2 . 
  ** football ** 4 . 
  ** basketball ** 5 . 
  ** volleyball ( * when/if we 're doing well * ),

   ask for tourism advice in / r/ireland what 's up with that ? 
  that 's very silly , even for cameron . 
  for comparison , next elections we should show all opinion polls in eastern arabic numerals and all exit polls in roman numerals , see if his stomach ulcers get worse . 
  i 've heard stories about the mythical $ 500 banknotes . 
  i 'd love to get a '' sample '' . 
  you know , just to '' inspect '' them . 
  to know they 're real . 
  we are loud as fuck . 
  sundays are very quiet , but we 're generally loud as fuck . 
  i wish people would shut their damn gob for once , or at least keep their voice down . 
   no : 52 %  yes : 58 % definite proof that cnn has been infiltrated by isis . 
  i have no idea how this map works and why it shows my country like this . 
  i think it is somewhat misleading . 
  for instance , i live in a city with a population of 200 thousand . 
  my parents live in one with 120 thousand people . 
  yet , both of these cities are a lot more hectic , crowded and stressful than munich and stuttgart where i visit my cousins and family . 
  so , when it comes to '' city life '' , then city structure , buildings , parks and the general urban planning is a lot more important than population density . 
  i 'm sure the part of the city and the neighborhood you live in are just as important . 
  i 'm a member of a streaming site that streams classic european films and we always argue about whether to watch something dubbed or subbed . 
  the important fact that people who support dubbing fail to realize , is that you do n't really have to focus half of your attention on reading the subtitles and the other half on what 's going on on-screen . 
  i do n't know if it takes 2 weeks or 2 years for that to happen , but reading the subs will eventually become second nature . 
  * p.s. 
  * if you watch a lot of staff on your computer and have a choice , stop putting on your native language 's subtitles and put the english subs instead ( for hollywood and everything american/british ) . 
  even that little thing will make a world of difference and will improve your viewing experience considerably !, 
  well that 's goddamn impressive . 
  in greece you can have about 30 minutes of peaceful , organized protest until some asshole throws a molotov or starts hurling rocks at the police . 
  then turmoil and disorder follows . 
  this is when all the normal people and families leave , and all that 's left is 40 hooligans clashing with the police . 
  it 's actually amazing how 5-10 people can ruin a demonstration of thousands . 
  visited oslo-stockholm this summer . 
  four days in each . 
  oslo is the most quiet and relaxing place on earth . 
  you start getting the feeling that nothing bad or stressful can happen to you while you 're there , everything is so peaceful . 
  athens and most big greek cities must have shocked you the first time you got here . 
  we hate albanians and germans now ? 
  let me add them to the '' imaginary list of nations greeks are supposed to hate '' . 
  time to unsubscribe from whatever tabloids you 're reading . 
  ahh thank you , this one 's the best so far . 
  op 's made my head hurt a little . 
  putting countries like spain and italy with bulgaria and serbia and then those with turkey makes no sense . 
  you may have read something on the web or seen a few statistics here and there , that could 've possibly misinformed you about the extend of ` power ' the church has here , especially when it comes to political influence and ability to interfere with the legislative procedure . 
  eagerly waiting for a greek to post about a news source that is anywhere close to objective and unbiased . 
  i remember when , on a similar question thread , a guy replied : '' protothema.gr and enikos.gr '' . 
  it still gives me a chuckle when i think about it . 
  anyway , when i really need to get my news in greek , i visit in.gr ; i do n't think it 's '' neutral '' , but quite honestly , i doubt you can find quality journalism in the greek language these days . 
  in da thread . 
  any thoughts on my results ? 
  english ( england ) 2 . 
  new zealandish 3 . 
  us black vernacular / ebonics 1 . 
  finnish ( ?! ), 
  hungarian ( ?! ),
