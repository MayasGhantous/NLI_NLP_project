  german * edit * : well , busted on my 3rd try . 
  english ( england ) 2 . 
  welsh ( uk ) 3 .

  finnish, 
  before the extensive popularization of the english language , french was considered the official ` language of diplomacy ' . 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_language#history ) : * french was the most important language of diplomacy and international relations from the 17th century to approximately the middle of the 20th century . 
  english has now taken over that role , following the second world war . 
  another little known fact that is interesting : greece actually had a chance to pick sides in ww2 . 
  on october 28 , at 4am , the italian ambassador in athens met face to face with the greek pm , metaxas , and gave him an ultimatum which demanded that greece allow axis forces to enter greek territory and occupy certain unspecified `` strategic locations '' or otherwise face war . 
  metaxas ' reply was '' alors , c'est la guerre '' ( then it is war ) . 
  ** 90 minutes later ** , the italian forces station in albania attacked the greek border , signifying the beginning of the greco-italian war . 
   they give them awful titles it used to happen ** a lot ** in the 90s or even 00s , it still is , but not to the same degree . 
  to be fair , as shitty as the titles are , it 's justified . 
  sometimes a movie title could be a reference to the american culture ( something well-known in the states ) or it could be completely impossible to translate to greek , so we just give the movie a title that would be more appealing to the greek audience . 
  this does n't always happen . 
  for instance , movie titles like the x-men , avatar , the wolverine , inception , seven , underworld etc etc remain exactly the same . 
  also , now that the tv channels know how many young people use the internet to visit english-speaking forums to talk about movies/tv-shows and whatnot , they mostly use the original tv-show title to advertize its broadcast . 
  for instance , i remember that the commercials for game of thrones season 1 on a greek channel referred to the show as '' \u03a0\u03b1\u03b9\u03c7\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a3\u03c4\u03ad\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 '' , but the following seasons were being advertised simply as '' game of thrones '' . 
  well the people conducting the survey sure forgot to ask you , because i do n't see romania at the top . 
   - greece.greekreporter.com . 
   - ( barely ) a 4 paragraph article  - in order to conduct the survey , the gallup asked people in these countries whether they had felt any anger , sadness , anxiety , physical pain or worry the previous day . 
  wow . 
  i do n't know if i can be very objective and leave my bias aside when judging kke , but i 'll try . 
  the running joke here is that kke 's rhetoric is like a broken record . 
  they 're amazingly adamant about their positions and worldview . 
  for years , no , for decades , it 's been pretty much the same . 
  1 ) leave the e.u. 
  2 ) leave nato . 
  3 ) power to the people !, 
  4 ) down with capitalism etc. 
  to me , it 's pretty obvious that they 're still roleplaying the bolsheviks in russia 1905 and russia 1917 , just waiting for that sweet , liberating revolution to finally happen and overthrow all the evil czars and greedy rulers . 
  i could be wrong , but i 'm suspecting that their internal structure and organization still somewhat adheres to the values of democratic centralism , but who knows . 
  many people will disagree , and again , this is just me , but my opinion is that they 're just occupying space in the political scene , and i doubt they 'll ever be of use . 
  they 're there just for the sake of being there . 
  til syriza is the radical left . 
  seems like the guardian went four , maybe five years back . 
  syriza 's rhetoric and overall image has changed ** substantially ** over the past few years . 
  the only thing left from the party 's ` radical ' days is its acronym and a few ( frail ) voices coming from the constituent groups * ( syriza is a unitary party , it was formed through the merger of smaller groups ) * which dislike the new direction that the party 's taking . 
  however , it 's pretty obvious that the leadership ( tsipras and his close associates ) have long forgotten about the ` radical ' days . 
  check this out :  the party polled 4 % in 2009 , became the main opposition in 2012 * ( 26 % ) * , and received 27 % of the vote in the european elections * ( 2014 ) * how do you think a party managed to advance so much in the course of 3 years without changing anything to its image ? 
  is it even remotely possible that syriza would 've gotten 27 % of the vote in the europarl elections if it kept ranting about '' greece getting out of the eurozone '' and '' greece distancing itself from the rest of the e.u. '' ? 
  absolutely no way . 
  - there 's a good chance i 'm just conflating the terms '' radical/extreme/far left '' and the way people use it in the uk or the rest of the e.u. , but i just thought i 'd throw this fyi because i think it 's highly misleading to refer to the party as ` radical left ' . 
  it reminds about andreas baader and the r.a.f. 
  so i thought it 's kinda silly . 
  ** tl/dr ** : syriza is not the party that it used to be , referring to it as '' radical left '' is misleading to say the least . 
  good to know that when a middle east dictator sends in his army to kill civilians , we 're allowed to scream bloody murder and accuse him of war crimes and crimes against humanity , but when a government approved by the west is doing the same thing , we can shrug it off by blaming it on '' the unfortunate nature of war '' . 
  gouge my eyes out already , your post almost made me throw up . 
  it goes the other way too though . 
  far right groups are so appealing to the masses because their rhetoric and proposed policies are in accordance with people 's wishes . 
   with a low turnout and ukip getting ~ 30 % of the vote , that translates into 10-15 % of the people can we stop with this bullshit already ? 
  no political analyst will ever say '' yes , 30 % voted for x party , but the turnout was only 56 % , so we 'll never know what 's really going on '' . 
  this is just something that started on reddit/internet forums , and it 's just wishful thinking and denial of what is happening in the e.u. 
  if ukip got 27 % , then it got 27 % . 
  the end . 
  even if we could somehow know ** exactly ** what percentage of the vote x party would 've gotten if there was 100 % turnout , it still would n't matter because there will never be anything close to a 100 % turnout . 
  jobbik got 14 % , fp\u00d6 got 19 % , gd got 9 % , ukip got 27 % and fn got 24 % . 
  unless you 're trying to prove something else and know what the election results would 've been if there was a 100 % turnout in every single e.u. 
  country , then the above percentages are ( unfortunately ) all that really matters . 
   propaganda war in / r/europe or on reddit in general . 
  because the kremlin cares so much about the opinion of people who argue on the internet , convey their thoughts in the form of le may-mays and one of their biggest problems is comcast 's data cap . 
  those the people who are going to change the world so what they think matters . 
  funny to see how on every map , athens is trying to stay ~ ~ relevant ~ ~ high . 
  downvoted for the shitty title , but i have to agree that it 'd be fair for junker to be elected as the president of the commission , since epp is the largest party and won the most seats in the european parliament . 
  you 're jerking it a bit too hard mate , even for this sub . 
  there 's a difference between exaggerating and twisting facts a bit to prove that russia is to blame for things russia is actually involved in , and blaming russia for eu 's response to the financial/political crisis and all the distrust and skepticism it has caused to the voters ' minds . 
  let 's focus on how to handle the rise of far-right wing parties in europe , instead of ( comfortably ) blaming others . 
  you 've just ascended to the next level of circlejerking . 
  what 's next ? 
  are we going to blame the evil russkies for the environmental crisis and the challenger disaster ? 
  cremation is absolutely legal in greece , but there have been delays in their construction . 
  [ read this ] ( http://www.tovima.gr/en/article/?aid=560432 ) , it 's actually amazing how it perfectly describes 95 % of problems in greece in 4 paragraphs . 
  the last 2 paragraphs say a lot about how governance and politics are done here . 
  i agree , but most europeans are hoping that the russians will never implement such a thing ... 
  as someone who needs to do a lot of uploading daily , i 'd rather have a 30/30 mbit connection than the 50/5 my isp offers . 
  when is santa coming to athens ? 
  i 'm curious if the good people on netflix are deliberately avoiding countries with very active p2p communities because they consider them a risk . 
  they 're probably right too . 
  after so many years without an option to watch foreign tv shows on demand legally , i 'm now not only addicted to binging on tv shows , i 'm addicted to torrenting too . 
  most people in europe with access to major private trackers and with couchpotato/sickbeard installed would n't even touch netflix anyway , there 's no reason to . 
  [ '' the pirate way '' ] ( https://i.imgur.com/qgeb6zk.jpg ) . 
  looks very nice to me . 
  does anyone know how/why is the the pirate bay affiliated with the pirate parties of the european elections ? 
  i think most of the parties ' members do n't actually advocate for illegal file-sharing , and even though the pirate bay itself is n't illegal , its history is full of prosecutions and legal troubles . 
  ( [ check 3rd paragraph ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/260qj2/we_are_candidates_for_the_pirate_party_in_the/chml7te ) ), 
  for public trackers you 're pretty much right , it would n't make a difference if you had a 300mbit dl speed or a 1000 mbit dl speed . 
  but on big private trackers , where everything is seeded with 500mbit and 1gbit seedboxes , then yes , you could utilize a 1gbit download speed . 
  damn :o . 
  you could even download a long-ass movie within 1 minute . 
  most decent 720p encodes of 2h + movies are - usually - anywhere from 5 to 9 gb . 
  so , with 1000mbit internet , you would be able to download an 8 gb 720p movie within 65 seconds !, 
  which is pretty damn awesome . 
  this must be your very first day on the internet . 
  check out what website you 're in . 
  people here are judging , complaining , angering and arguing over any possible thing , petty or not . 
  booing at two 17 year old russian girls in a singing contest held in denmark . 
  the epitome of bravery .
