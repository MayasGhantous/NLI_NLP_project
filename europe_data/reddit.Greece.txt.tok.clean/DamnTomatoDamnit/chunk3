  the only country with aaaa is madagascar . 
  the fundamental right to protest and freely express yourself is something beautiful unless someone who disagrees with you is doing it , right ? 
  it 's a really circlejerky sketch on greek national television , from a major tv channel , so yes , it 's not exactly quality comedy . 
  enjoy it , mega channel ca n't do much better than this . 
  i could go into detail about why greek tv is not for people younger than 40 , and why using torrent clients to download foreign tv shows is so popular here , but i 'm feeling lazy right now , so i 'll tell you tomorrow , maybe . 
  it 's mostly exaggerating , and that 's a standard in comedy , but you just ca n't deny the * ` list goes on ... ' * part haha . 
  also , no one is ever going to believe us , and i 'm not sure if it 's still happening in greece 2014 , but yes , we 're fighting over who 's gon na pay the bill . 
  people in this subreddit would rather post an article from superawesomenews.ua which claims that russians sacrifice infants and use their blood as perfume oil than post an article from reuters that exposes the wrongdoings of pro-ukrainian activists . 
  maybe we should just rename this subreddit to / r/ukrainetoday until the crisis is over . 
  czech at heart !, 
  i do n't want to stand out in any way  prague here i come . 
  til : only hitler has ever annexed another country and used propaganda to distort public opinion . 
  comparing putin to hitler is a ridiculously misplaced comparison . 
  even richard nixon had more similarities to hitler than putin has now . 
  ca n't blame al jazeera for reporting bullshit stories like this . 
  judging from most replies in this thread , people just fucking love to imagine semi-civilized grekos who are always furious with their masters up north . 
  i like how the whole '' greeks hate ze evil germans '' is a fictitious story made up by the media to distract both nations from any actual issues they may be facing . 
  * make one believe the other one has a grudge against you = less focus on how merkel , samaras , the imf , the ecb etc , etc are handling the crisis . 
  * every-damn-time some nutjob has a poorly-phrased , inane thing to say about the '' imposed austerity from the devious germans '' , international media have a field day with that . 
  do you really give a shit about what erdogan has to say regarding the massacre of greeks ? 
  do you want him to specifically mention us or what ? 
  and again , who cares ? 
  yes , same for me , it 's redirecting me to ustream.tv every single time . 
  it 's been like that for 4-5 days . 
  a good alternative is http://subscene.com/ . 
   - full training suit  - gold around their neck  - slim t-shirts what the hell , they dress exactly like that here too . 
  what is it with gypsies and ugly '' golden '' trinkets ? 
  with a variety of articles that meticulously analyze matters of grave importance such as * sarah palin 's school of rock * , * does ` ebony ' condone bigotry ? 
  * , * slut-shaming of bridget anne kelly * and * why we ca n't quit bush and clinton * . 
  [ every.damn.time . 
  found [ this ad from aegean airlines ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm3msvp4za4 ) , it 's basically the exact opposite of what i 'm saying , stereotype confirmed !, 
  yes dammit !, 
  uk + quiet people . 
  nope . 
  at least not when they 're on vacation and half drunk :p, 
  no please . 
  let us watch a 19m documentary from current and then just speculate . 
  i 'm mostly worried about the one after that , with the xenomorphs from planet lv-426 . 
  seriously though ? 
  if greek media knows that you can '' bypass these restrictions with a vpn '' ( as they 've been reporting all morning ) , then turks relying on twitter to organize and inform people know it too . 
  restricting access to a site does nothing . 
  for people in turkey or any other part of the world who have to deal with shit like that , do a quick search in / r/torrents or even better go to / r/vpn . 
  check out [ this article ] ( http://torrentfreak.com/which-vpn-services-take-your-anonymity-seriously-2014-edition-140315/ ) and [ pia 's site ] ( https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/ ), 
   on top of that , you cant judge a country based on the actions of 2 individuals living in it . 
  that did n't stop reddit and the western media from starting a colossal anti-russia circlejerk since before the sochi olympics started . 
  aleksandar makedonski was stronk slavic king . 
  recognize or gtfo . 
  now i 'm curious how the finns ask someone to go out on a date with them . 
  i can imagine nato officers spamming putin 's inbox with the navy seal copypasta . 
  never mind that , even if there are informative articles about this issue posted on reddit , ** people never actually read them ** . 
  they 'll only read the top 5 comments of each thread , which just distort the truth and initiate a relentless circlejerk . 
  which proves that reddit alone can not be your source for everything . 
  you 'll have to research something yourself at some point . 
  for the record , people have said what you just did before , they always get buried because they actually make sense and ruin everyone 's circlejerk . 
  definitely a culture shock . 
  the only thing i ( kind of ) understand is that a superbowl commercial is usually more entertaining and/or funny than your average tv commercial , but still , seeing all these people who are actually eager to view them makes no sense . 
  sure , [ some commercials ] ( http://youtu.be/316azlyfazw ) are just too good , but all this hysteria and excitement is a really unnatural behavior ( at least in my opinion ) . 
   brussels : the clich\u00e9 nowadays is that they all speak french . 
  and they spend all their time arguing why their city is the best/not as shitty as everyone thinks . 
  how shitty can the capital of belgium be ? 
  the eu has its main institutions in that city and many international conferences are being hosted there . 
  i had no idea about this stereotype and i do n't get it either . 
  sad for us . 
  we 're giving a hard time to a helpless country that is trying to establish an ethnic identity . 
  if everyone knows that modern macedonians are slavs , and alexander , greek or not , was tutored by aristotle himself , was exposed to greek civilization from a young age , was heavily influenced by the greek culture and developed a passion for the works of homer , then does it really matter if a handful of slavs want to call themselves macedonians ? 
  are we really that vexed about other nations referring to the country as '' macedonia '' instead of '' fyrom '' ? 
  an ethnic group that woke up one morning in 1991 and figured they are the true descendants of alexander the great is laughable , if not completely ridiculous . 
  we should be laughing at them , not vetoing them . 
  i do n't think it 's true that they 're not considered humans by most people , but he 's kind of right about the '' racism is acceptable '' part . 
  the whole concept is that , the fact that they do n't want to help themselves in the first place , and insist on living the way they do somehow ` justifies ' the discrimination and hatred society feels against them . 
  as in '' if you 're actually putting effort into being a social outcast , then you deserve what 's coming for you '' . 
  maybe i misjudged the situation in ukraine and how things work there , but it looks like the government is far from allowing the police use deadly force freely . 
  there must be some kind of restraint . 
  should the protesters use guns at this point ? 
  even compared to syria 2 years ago , the situation in ukraine is still mild . 
  it 's too early for the ukrainian citizens to take extreme measures . 
  another thing to consider is how more complicated things would get if citizens decided to arm themselves . 
  i 've seen protests in athens with a crowd of hundreds turn into a pointless clash with the police just because a douchebag threw a molotov in the first place . 
  the crowd dispersed and all that was left 10 minutes later was 30 hot-headed morons throwing rocks at the police . 
  what would happen if people in ukraine started using guns ? 
  would women/teenagers/old people have a chance to safely participate in a protest ? 
  would they be as unified ? 
  also , from what i 've read , the e.u. 
  ( particularly germany ) is indirectly supporting the protesters ( they reacted strongly to the anti-protesting bills ) but i do n't know if that would be the case if people decided to arm themselves and turn it into a conflict . 
  it 's easier for a government or a union to show its support for a crowd of peaceful protesters , much harder for armed citizens . 
  it would just give yanukovych and russia an excuse to call them dangerous terrorists and take the '' appropriate measures '' . 
  i just do n't see how violence could possibly help the ukrainian movement , ** not at this point at least ** . 
  totally . 
  police brutality and violence should be responded with even more violence , nothing can go wrong with this plan . 
   police storms in [ metropolitan volunteer hospital of elliniko , and doctors of the world ] ( http://www.thepressproject.gr/article/49486/efodos-tis-astunomias-kai-sto-farmakeio-ton-giatron-tou-kosmou ) a lot more serious than i thought , but : 1 ) the complaints made were not anonymous 2 ) the drug enforcement agency and \u0395\u039f\u03a6 's investigation turned up nothing 3 ) the organization is going to take legal action against the person who made the complaint  the prime minister called volunteer hospitals and marketplaces as `` products of populism , and mechanisms outside the rule of law '' that [ are not necessary to a `` social state '' ] ( http://www.avgi.gr/article/1195236/oi-domes-allilegguis-sto-stoxastro ) a leftist newspaper relying on populism as much as our beloved pm . 
  those volunteer marketplaces and '' \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03c9\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 '' mostly involve [ private corps ] ( http://www.carrefour.gr/inside.aspx?a_id=189 ) in cooperation with each town 's municipality . 
  obviously not under the direct control of the government . 
  [ a map with all of them all around greece ] ( http://organosi20.gr/wp-content/plugins/leaflet-maps-marker/leaflet-fullscreen.php?layer=23 )  social marketplace , where farmers trade their produce without intermediaries is [ also intimidated by the police ] ( http://www.seleo.gr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=116979:efodos-astunomikon-kai-eforiakon-stous-xoris-mesazontes-sthn-beroia&amp;catid=108:2013-04-13-14-27-48&amp;itemid=162 ) cutting out the intermediaries and causing the prices of quality agriculture products and olive oil to drop by 50 % ? 
  how is that a solution ? 
  how would that not have consequences on our exports and how is it not a fiasco ? 
  you 're comparing the authoritarian rule of tayyip erdogan with the incompetence of the greek state , but that 's just my opinion . 
  and to get back on topic , it is very unlikely that you will be [ denied ] ( http://youtu.be/wh0rbez90vk?t=2m25s ) medical assistance [ during a protest/riot ] ( http://youtu.be/2bk9eisrrfc?t=1m29s ) . 
   greece already does that . 
  greek police routinely targets social/volunteer hospitals for `` narcotics inspections '' and other absurd charges that end up being made out of thin air , in order to intimidate volunteers . 
  never heard about that .
