  on the contrary , most of our volunteer initiative programs get as much attention as possible . 
  usually some of the big tv channels , advertising companies and various ngo 's are trying to organize them or get involved one way or another . 
  the government wants to encourage these kind of initiatives so as to mitigate the effects of the austerity measures and avoid having to deal with more protests/riots , not the other way around . 
   nationality has very little to do with it . 
  too true . 
  you could be living in a place that gets -25 c winters all the time , or a place that always gets +37 summers , but you ** never ** actually get used to it . 
  every year , when may is about to end i get all horrified just by thinking that in a few weeks the temperature is going to rise above +28 -29 c. 
  now things are a little better , but back in the day winter used to be harsh ( at least by northern greece 's standards ) , ~ -5 c that could get as low as -8 c , and after that a summer with temperatures climbing to +39 c , where you felt your head is about to explode and you could pass out any moment . 
  not pretending that we 're the most secular country on earth , but that was really unexpected . 
  when jimmy panousis did shit like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ektrql5.jpg ) , [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gjjpbwq.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ujnidna.jpg ) no one really cared , and that was 10 years ago . 
  anyway , my point is , i highly doubt that this case will set a precedent . 
  i ** hope ** i 'm right about this . 
  where the hell is this all coming from ? 
  it is an honest question , where do people like ex9gagger and justsmall read/listen to those things and then comment about them on / r/europe ? 
  if you honestly think that the majority ( or even a big part ) of the greek population have some kind of grudge and deep hatred against the e.u. 
  or merkel , then maybe it 's time to unsubscribe from spiegel . 
  [ youtube link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6anwbwem6u ) no english subtitles though :(, 
  not so fat there ireland . 
  i once tried to get insight on the american mind , but there was nothing there . 
  i think toyota is doing great . 
   the biggest approval of co-responsibility were men in age of 18-34 , ironically group of men responsible for the most rape . 
  i 'm not 100 % sure about this yet , but was this survey set up with the purpose of portraying men in the most negative way possible ? 
  ( perhaps as a ploy to raise awareness )  survey also asked if people think woman is co-responsible for her rape . 
  `` yes '' said one third of respondents and half of men . 
  and :  a woman is wholly or partly responsible for the rape if she : these two bother me the most . 
  '' co-responsible '' and '' partly responsible '' could be interpreted in a thousand different ways , ranging from : * '' i wholeheartedly sympathize with rape victims , but they should always take measures to protect themselves , if they do n't they 're partly accountable '' * to * '' they totally deserved what happened to them , i do n't feel any kind of pity for them whatsoever '' * . 
  all that is translated in your title as : * rape victim wearing miniskirt ? 
  she was asking for it , say 50 % of czech men *, 
  nice amerilogic there . 
  suicide , hard drugs for personal use , contraception for teenagers , vaccination and seatbelts are also a few things that , by your theory , should be left to each individual 's judgement . 
  however it does n't mean that there should n't be a collective effort to prevent/encourage , educate or punish negligence . 
  just allowing everyone to run wild without supervision , prevention and incentives to improve themselves does n't necessarily mean '' more freedom '' . 
  that 's 3rd grade logic . 
  * inarticulate mumbling *, 
  this has nothing to do with what '' supposedly the syrian men ought to be doing '' it 's just what '' european men wish would have happened '' . 
  really hypocritical to upload a video with a title like this to imply that syrian men have some sort of sacred patriotic duty that they abandoned , while you 're sitting thousands of kilometers away in the comfort of your own house and have never been anywhere near a war . 
  should 've posted this clickbait a month ago , when it was still fresh circlejerk . 
  [ saudi arabia has welcomed thousands of syrians ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/09/saudi-arabia-denies-giving-syrians-sanctuary-150912050746572.html ) , but has given them freedom of movement and does n't formally register them as ` refugees ' . 
  their claim that they 've taken 2.5 million is probably bullshit , but it is certain that the number is in the hundreds of thousands . 
  tonight check / r/nbastreams . 
  also [ this thread ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/nbastreams/comments/3jvxh9/eurobasket_streams/ ) . 
  with greece to the south , turkey to the southeast and ~ ~ fyrom ~ ~ ~ ~ macedonia ~ ~ those other guys to the west , bulgaria got tired of this shit and decided to bail . 
  finally , a middle-ground opinion i can get behind . 
  fleeing an unstable , hellish warzone and then trying to find a welcoming state with an organized support system and benefits is a reasonable thing . 
  it may seem over-demanding and opportunistic to us now , but you ca n't really blame them for being unreasonable . 
  however , what 's problematic on our side is how we approach the issue of this ` compassion ' and ` humanity ' we 're supposed to show . 
  yes , as human beings we 're allowed to feel these things and help them as best as we can , but not to the point where we coerce ourselves into making hasty decisions that 'll have a big and probably irreversible impact on our everyday life for decades to come . 
  ** tl-dr : ** help them by any means * we can afford long-term * and a realistic plan ( which germany can handle , i 'd bet ) . 
  we do n't have to make political decisions on the basis of guilt or compassion . 
  i 've no idea why this is getting downvoted ; it 's a really interesting ama that has nothing to do with the stuff that makes it to / r/all . 
  very descriptive answers and the thread is an enjoyable read overall . 
   she said others would have taken her place if she stopped selling supplies to the migrants . 
  what an unbelievably shameless defensive argument . 
  '' if i had n't sold all this colombian cocaine shipped to europe myself , someone else would have anyway '' . 
  yeh it really looks like 99 % of these people are basically expressing their wishful thinking , not a legitimate concern or fear . 
  there 'd be absolutely zero incentive for greece to comply with what you 're suggesting . 
  the country is about to elect a new government and it 's a period of political uncertainty and newly surfacing financial instability . 
  why would any greek government willingly cooperate with a plan that 'd make the country the focal point of yet another european crisis ? 
  my gyros brings all the deutsch to the yard , and they 're like , it trumps kebab , damn right , it trumps kebab , do you like it ? 
  it is not haram . 
  naaah that was * macedonia * . 
   hard to sympathize with greeks ** on this ** no one asked you to sympathize with * 10 million greeks * because a * privately-owned * tv channel decided to cover an abbreviation . 
  it 's like , you people connect everything you see on this sub with the whole population of a country like it 's a single entity , to make it all simple in your heads . 
  would you get angry at the brits for a misleading article you read on the telegraph or angry at the french for watching a crap documentary on tv5monde ? 
  bah it does n't have much to do with the italian army in particular and it 's not exclusive to italy . 
  satirizing the enemy and mocking him in times of war was pretty widespread in europe during ww2 , and i 'm sure it predates that . 
  see charlie chaplin 's * the great dictator ( 1940 as well ) * for example . 
  so , songs like this one were n't a direct result of mussolini 's incompetence , just a way for nations to empower and strengthen its people . 
  [ reginella campagnola ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_woodpecker_song ) is an italian song that became a hit in 1940 . 
  during the same year a greek artist , giorgos oikonomides , used the music from the song and added lyrics that satirized and ridiculed mussolini and his army 's march to conquer greece . 
  the ` revised ' song became known in greece as [ * foolish mussolini ( to rome ) * , sometimes called '' with a smile on their face '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2_lrw_hp2c ) . 
  an interesting anecdote is that presumably , when the nazis invaded greece ( after the italian 's defeat ) , their troops enjoyed to play the song in front of their italian counterparts to vex them . 
  whoa there . 
  next you 'll tell me that all those famous douches taking the ice bucket challenge did n't actually give a shit about people suffering from als . 
  suddenly greece looks like the smartest player in the game . 
  play the long con or do n't play at all huehue . 
   lso il giornale is a very biased source ( berlusconi personal newspaper ) right now the post has only 26 points and a * 60 % upvoted * . 
  you know it 's a bullshit source when even / r/europe does n't fall for it . 
  yep . 
  a. bierce 's quote is relevant here , while i generally do n't agree with such generalizations : '' politics : a strife of interests masquerading as a contest of principles . 
  the conduct of public affairs for private advantage . '', 
  man i do n't really understand geo-blocking . 
  oh god , i remember watching a documentary about this years ago and i still remember it , because at some point they show a grieving mother dressed in black , walking around the ruins of the school in despair , ` looking ' for her lost son . 
  definitely the most fucked up thing i 'd seen that day . 
  and it 's generally a really freaky , depressing story . 
  ** edit : ** never mind that poor-ass description , [ it 's archived in the channel 's website ] ( http://www.megatv.com/warzone/pages.asp?catid=15798&amp;subid=2&amp;pubid=3985176 ) . 
  wait for the vid to buffer and go to 51m . 
  too bad they are n't subtitling these , it 's a pretty good doc . 
  there 's also scenes from beslan massacre in the title sequence . 
  ** edit 2 : ** pffffffffffffffff, 
  those are n't just the stark words , ser refugee , it 's a fact . 
  edit : on a serious note , it would be interesting to see the statistics of how many refugees arrived on boat to europe during summer 2014 , what was the traffic during winter 2014 , how much it increased from may-august 2015 , and compare all this to what will follow during the coming winter . 
  if the refugees get more desperate and the traffickers more greedy and reckless , then more tragic will unfold . 
  fleeing to europe on a rubber boat during winter is insanity . 
  dae think all ukrainians are innocent harmless angels of virtue and all turmoil is instigated by le evil russkies ? 
  xdddd, 
  hmmmm do we want a fucked up middle east on its own , or do we want a fucked up middle east and a few billion euros thrown down that black hole ? 
  what a dilemma . 
  it 's not 1991 . 
  we do n't need to add an extra 30 pages to some history book to learn our lesson .
