  / r/showerthoughts, 
  hey , it 's the only kind of shower that produces soap rather than waste it !, 
  there 's always someone who 'll upload the subs for each group 's release anyway ( if you 're planning to dl it ), 
  * '' merkel says x country is to blame for y problem affecting the whole ez/eu in an attempt to sidetrack voters from her own ineffectiveness , while keeping her unchallenged leading role within the union with the least responsibility possible '' * has been the unofficial motto of cdu since 2010-2011 . 
  it 's how the communication part of the eurozone crisis had been dealt with , but since the german government is ( probably ) planning to use the same strategy with most of europe 's major problems , i can see more and more people feeling agitated in the coming years . 
  for once , it 's a politician 's actions that i find noteworthy and his words hypocritical . 
   first we 'll save human lives even at the cost of losing votes . 
  is n't this statement alone a proclamation that he 's a expecting people 's votes as a reward for his actions ? 
   i think it 's been over 100 years since a wolf killed anyone in western europe not only are they generally scared of humans , but there 's barely any wolf population in western europe anyway . 
  in season 5 she started looking like a pedophile . 
  prisons are often called '' correctional facilities '' and in an ideal world that 's what they 're supposed to do : punish a criminal , keep him away from the rest of society and at the same time * try to * rehabilitate him , if possible . 
  prison cells do n't necessarily have to be tiny torture chambers and the prison system is n't obligated to provide appeasement and retribution to the blood-thirsty morons of the general public . 
  it depends on what your internet speed is and what picture quality you deem ` decent ' . 
  if you 're on a  20mbps connection and looking for bluray quality , go for torrents . 
  what he means is that rutracker is great only when compared to public indexes ( kickass , tpb etc ) , but does n't even come close to most famous private trackers . 
  actually , when it comes to music i 've heard that it 's second only to what.cd , but easily surpasses waffles in content . 
  i guess the only thing he ever raped was the confidentiality of state secrets . 
  at least now that bratislava waitress who kinda-sorta felt vaguely angry at greek pensioners is now avenged . 
  i like [ this one ] ( https://i.imgur.com/bu2hkcv.jpg ) too . 
  i understand why no one 's taking this law seriously since it 's more or less unenforceable , but i do n't get why they 're trivializing ripping itself . 
  ( music ) cds / ~ ~ dvd ~ ~ / blu-ray ripping is not obsolete and it 's not a thing of the past . 
  the only reason people are able to download ( via p2p ) a movie in 720p/1080p bluray quality is because someone ripped from the blu-ray ( sometimes from more than one blu-ray for a single movie ) and encoded it . 
  oftentimes people who legally own physical media will need to rip them , convert to an appropriate container or encode the video/sound in way that it 's compatible with their mobiles/ipads/tvs . 
  do n't invite erdogan again , he 's a party pooper . 
  the result for greece ( and perhaps other eu countries with good food ) does n't really depict reality . 
  its not very relevant . 
  fast food chains are n't really a big thing here ( even in athens ) since you have better alternatives ( souvlaki , gyros etc ) . 
  souvlaki and gyros shops are usually owned by small businessmen , so the only known outlet they could 've put on the map was starbucks , which probably does n't even make it to top 10 in greece . 
  * tl : dr : * no one in his right mind would call you and say '' let 's go and grab a bite at mcdonalds '' . 
  that would n't make a lot of sense . 
  all sunloungers would be reserved with towels by 5.30 am and all beaches would be packed by 7 am . 
  no volleyball , rackets or anything that 's too noisy , and music in bars would be limited to 40 decibels . 
  absolutely no all-nighters , everyone to sleep by 11.30 pm . 
  drugs are verboten . 
  i can see how the british tourists would very quickly revolt and try to reclaim the place . 
  brtis fighting germans in greece with help from the locals . 
   how can you read it any other way yet somehow , sybaritic managed to read it right . 
  there 's people who know what they 're doing , get a permit from the municipality and do their job ; and then there 's people who should never touch a spray can in their lives . 
  i 've no idea how this discussion deserves to be continued . 
  i honestly ca n't fathom how there are people who still do this . 
  '' hur durr this street seems a bit too clean and tidy , let me graffiti on this 100 year old building to make the place look like a sao paulo slum '' . 
  all of these are facts that the average adult here recognizes , but will simply not publicly admit with 20 cameras in front of his face . 
  though everyone firmly believes that the austerity measures topped it off . 
  how easy do you think it is , to make a 50 year old parent consciously realize that his past decisions and failures have ultimately ruined the future of his own kids ? 
  likewise , the '' very responsible and benevolent '' european media , by pointing fingers and assuming the role of a prosecutor , pretty much encouraged people 's self-justification and made them prone to populism . 
  ( well , not alone , obviously ), 
  wow i 'm reading through imperial units right now . 
  is self-torture the main principle of the imperial system ? 
  this is the logic by which many people ( on both private/public sector ) decided to vote for syriza , so you got that one right , ** but largely ** this is not the case . 
  keep in mind that it were n't only people outside of greece who were dumbfounded by the party 's choices and the way it went about negotiating with the creditors . 
  we 'll have to keep in mind the alternatives that the voters had on january 25th and the widespread notion that , by changing the ruling party , you can magically improve a tough situation . 
  it 's a way of thinking that you 'll encounter in most western democracies and it 's not limited to greece . 
  then i have no idea what this article 's suggestion is . 
  i thought it was all about money that would be better used elsewhere . 
  everyone 's stating that '' austerity worked for us , it should work for them too '' and then go on about comparing their situation to ours . 
  i do n't see how the austerity measures of those countries are comparable to ours . 
  they also conveniently forget to mention portugal or spain , which would be much more relevant to the discussion of greece 's bailout programs . 
  i very clearly remember lithuania which was only a few months ago , but i somehow thought latvia was 2013 , not early 2014 . 
  still a full year before tsipras ' government . 
  so why did n't we see a change of plans , centered around estonia , slovakia and latvia instead of greece . 
  you know , something that would be actualized , instead of using it as a card against greece . 
  it 'd only be fair . 
  i just think that all these articles only serve as someone else 's rhetoric , not a step in a direction which would be beneficial for those countries . 
  very weird how when our previous government would sign every deal presented by imf/ecb , baltic 's economic state was n't a consideration . 
  is this just astroturfing , or do they really plan on helping those poorer e.u. 
  countries ? 
  because the latter , even at the expense of greece would truly be great . 
  why did n't it happen earlier and how was greece 's fault that imf/ecb chose to waste their money on an '' economy that deserved to be in that state anyway '' ? 
  if this is n't just another communication stunt , only meant to improve the creditor 's position , and they 're actually willing ** to take action ** and help those economies , then i 'm eagerly and happily waiting for that to happen . 
  yet something tells me that when the time comes for something of the essence to happen , we 'll move on from slovakia and latvia to ukraine , moldova and perhaps georgia , only to keep theorizing about who should suffer less and who deserves what and why . 
  yes , yes , the fact that everything has to pass an undefined '' honor test '' and '' pride test '' is one of the many reasons we 're in this situation in the first place . 
  why do we always have to force some '' national dignity '' narrative to things that should be purely financial/political is beyond me . 
  never mind that these concepts tend to be vague and can be interpreted in any way that suits people . 
  it 's not like the other side did n't encourage all this by moralizing and pestering greeks enough to make them act defensive , but if you were so concerned about economic autonomy , maybe you should n't bring your own country to a state where it was completely dependent to the lending of multinational organizations ? 
  imagine how silly all of 'em atheists will feel when esa discovers that god is in fact real and resides somewhere between neptune and uranus . 
  people without a clue about economy make financial decisions that shape up the economy every day . 
  one would argue that legislative and reforming financial decisions are made by ex-economists who in turn consult economists , but almost always made within a political environment anyway . 
  so an economist giving advice on the aftermath of a yes or no result is of course very interesting to read about , but i do n't know how * what they themselves would vote * is in any way important . 
  did n't know that only people with a degree in political science should be allowed to vote in general elections either . 
  [ too many options . 
   totally your fault not that i ca n't always appreciate a buzzkill , but you see how this works both ways , right ? 
  the sign should 've been : * europe without greece is where both sides suddenly run out of shitty excuses . 
  it 's literally a '' research '' by pew research center , an american think tank . 
  it often focuses on crap like '' public life '' and social trends . 
  ** trends ** for christs sake . 
  this '' survey '' again from ** 2012 ** that all it says is * '' look everyone , these peoples ' stereotyping is more delusional than other peoples ' stereotyping !, 
  '' * that was only 3 years ago , when greek citizens were already pressured and defamed enough to incite defensive , prideful attitudes like that . 
  what answers did you expect ? 
  suggesting that bbc purposely put a slightly ambiguous title in one of their articles is hardly a conspiracy . 
  would n't say it 's ` malice ' either . 
  it just is . 
  they could 've put '' ukraine 's naftogaz suspends gas purchases from russia '' and it would 've been a poor title too . 
  yet , conveniently they made it look like an aggressive action by russia .

  tongue-in-cheek . 
  anyone can dress up and have whatever hobby they damn please .
