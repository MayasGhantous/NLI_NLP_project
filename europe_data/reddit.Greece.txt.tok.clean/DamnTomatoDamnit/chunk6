  d&d looks pretty cool tbh , and if i 'm not mistaken it was fairly popular in athens during 00s . 
  i 'm pretty sure they 're mostly awkward man-children with emotional problems . 
  looks like this furry fandom is the d&d of ' 10s . 
  an employee of the greek national bank who makes spelling mistakes like he 's 8 . 
  what a surprise . 
  google translate does a meh job with these articles . 
  is there any portuguese economist/journalist who 's publishing articles in english ? 
  i kinda did . 
  rip in pieces my 50mbps connection : /, 
  not so sure about that . 
  there 's over a dozen mods in this subreddit . 
  if that were the case , at least some of them would disagree and there 'd be friction all the time . 
  then again , removing posts about france and making just one sticky megathread to '' reduce clatter '' does n't make sense either , when at the same time there 's 10 different threads about putin/russia and another 15 about greece/crisis every day . 
  i thought it was a local trait , but later in life i realized that it 's an international problem . 
  personally i think that if your job is to be stuck in traffic all day , then slowly transforming into a twat is your destiny . 
  yes , yes , i remember . 
  it 's like you say . 
  my grandma would always have [ a stack of sweetened condensed milk ] ( https://i.imgur.com/7fkh1ob.jpg ) in her kitchen just for me . 
  then as i was growing up i forgot all about it and never saw it again . 
  i think some people will still use it for recipes , but have n't seen it in ages . 
   over the edge their suicide rates would 've been higher , but thankfully there 's nothing in denmark where you can jump from . 
  well it seems like you 've found yourself a new home then . 
  if you 're already living a lavish , comfy life ** by title ** , is n't it better to at least avoid tax evasion and fraud ? 
  leave that to greedy , corrupt people who at least make their money through an actual job . 
  however people often forget that you ca n't be le awesome , blue blooded persona who carries out '' institutional , cultural , academic and welfare activities '' without being a piece of shit first . 
  her husband embezzled funds from a charitable foundation ? 
  whoa , some people are fuckwits by birthright . 
  up until the mid 80s it was a common practice ( do n't know exactly how common ) for teachers to spank students ' hands with a narrow stick . 
  so if you could n't recite 5 pages from odyssey you 'd have to stand up and extend your hands [ like this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/nywhxmj.jpg ) . 
  corporal punishment may still be used in some of the less enlightened parts of the country , but i would n't bet on it . 
  to me it 's just a shitty excuse for mediocre teachers to compensate for their incompetence . 
  actually , temperatures in sweden are good enough to allow for bathing in early summer . 
  it 's just that muslim patrols have banned indecent exposure . 
  i know what you 're talking about . 
  i thank australia every day . 
  oh man if that were an actual issue in peoples lives , can you imagine how bitter manchester united ^ ^ ^ ^ fc fans would be ? 
  wow this is what europe actually believes . 
  they never actually shot a scene there , they only used images and textures from meteroa for cgi , as can be seen in the video . 
  hmmmm i do n't know man , malta looks beautiful . 
  if turkey wants , we can invade concurrently and then split it 50/50 with a nice un buffer zone . 
  we 'll even promise to not ruin it financially . 
  it 'll run solely on tourism and british naval bases . 
  i can take neonazis , fascists and racists seriously , in the sense that propagating for these things is a severe problem . 
  but when someone 's holding a * race mixing is communism * sign i ca n't help but chuckle . 
  it 's more of a bad attempt at comedy if anything . 
  if you 're gon na be a moron at least do it right . 
  make it '' race mixing breeds abominations '' or '' race mixing is the colored man 's conquest '' or something just as stupidly heavy-handed . 
  are we done then ? 
  is the drama over ? 
  both / u/davidreiss666 and / u/crnaruka are no longer mods of this subreddit , so i reckon there are no more unresolved issues concerning the management of / r/europe . 
   cypriot football 's 1st division 1974-75  cypriot football 's 1st division 1954-55 yes , but why ? 
  that 's why i 'm hoping for an increase of american and australian tourists this summer , who are ever so eager to spend their money , as opposed to our other traditional tourist groups who tend to be more frugal and spend most of their time inside all inclusive hotels . 
  not that i 'm complaining though . 
  it 's very easy to fall in love with the latter and in some cases you do n't have any other options . 
  wow when did all that happen ? 
  news reporting in greece really took a downturn !, 
  but anyway , just in case you are n't kidding : the whole '' united through hatred '' concept being muttered every once in a while here would never work and would never accomplish anything . 
  european states will never truly consolidate just because they encountered a common '' enemy '' , be it russians , turks , muslim radicals or illegal immigrants . 
  it 'd never be anything longstanding , honest or well-founded . 
  so i guess we must find another , less comfortable way . 
  i know we 're just memeing around , but there 's a lot of truth in that statement . 
  if we were born 30 years earlier , we would now belong to the generation who fucked up , not the one who 'll be fucked over !, 
  yes please . 
  oh how much do i wish we disappear into irrelevance . 
  better to be forgotten than to be despised . 
  very disheartening that none of these people are smiling . 
  most of them have a really gloomy look in their eyes . 
  run lola run ca n't get enough praise . 
  it would easily make it on my top 10 all-time favourites . 
  i second the counterfeiters too , good suggestion . 
  karl markovics gave a great performance . 
  wow maybe i 'll try to find more on this . 
  ex special forces members connected to the serbian mafia assassinating the president ? 
  how could the security agency or some intelligence agency not know that there 's an ongoing conspiracy to kill the president and prevent it ? 
  f-four hundred years you say ? 
  ; _ ; that 's my trigger number . 
  suddenly i feel much closer to germany . 
   i do n't know if you can truthfully talk about public support if the country ranks 117 . in the world press freedom index . 
  if all people see is government propaganda of course they will eventually have public support . 
  oh wow , it 's so funny and at the same time so hypocritical that i 've ** never ** seen anyone use the same argument in defense of the russian people . 
  just hate-mongering .

  of all the half-truths , things taken out of context , exaggerations and dramatizations i 've seen over the past 5 years , the whole issue of the german war reparations is the most fascinating to me . 
  it 's almost like some things only live on the internet , our television screens and syriza 's press office . 
  are they asking me to ignore reality and focus on what i read on an nbc/bild/ekathimerini article ? 
  sometimes it feels like it . 
  sure enough , i 'll hear people saying that only merkel is to blame , only schauble is to blame , the e.u. 
  is targeting greece , the imf wants to rule greece , draghi wants to obliterate greece etc etc. 
  however , ordinary people demanding the payment of war reparations is far more rare . 
  while the whole situation seems to be surreal to me , syriza 's campaign may be very , very real . 
  but are the greek people all that supportive of this one ? 
  not so sure about that . 
  some slovakian or some austrian guy browsing through this subreddit would think that the german war reparation is hot topic here and everyone 's riled up , but why is reality so differing from all these reports ? 
  ( this is mostly based on bittorrent , i do n't know much about streaming and kinox ) i agree with the point being made here , a service being taken down will usually result in a couple of copycats or very similar services , which makes the whole '' anti-piracy operation '' thing ineffective . 
  however we should keep another thing in mind , which i bet copyright holders and law enforcement are aware of and use it as an excuse to conduct such operations : * a bittorrent website like tpb is more than a public index of . torrent files * . 
  there is ( was ? ), 
  a large community , moderators and well-known uploaders who are somewhat organized and congregated in one place . 
  law enforcement aims to disrupt and dislocate exactly that , the community . 
  think of examples like demonoid . 
  what was the main complaint of users of the new demonoid when it came back up about a year ago ?
