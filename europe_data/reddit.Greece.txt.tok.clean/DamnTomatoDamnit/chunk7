  that the new demonoid misses a lot of its past content and most of its prolific uploaders are not there anymore . 
  think of publichd . 
  a public website which irrc had its own tracker and its own encoding team , nearly similar in quality with some well-known private trackers . 
  yet it went down and we have yet to see a proper replacement . 
  think of what would happen if rutracker shut down . 
  would its '' offsprings '' have the same quality control and retention as the original rutracker now has ? 
  probably not . 
  not a bad article , but it 's stupid to see things like '' a conflict that has haunted europe '' . 
  it has haunted the people who actually live on the island . 
  the rest of europe gave the minimum possible fuck . 
  he does n't understand the difference of failing to do it and not attempting it . 
  also made me realize that the stereotype of the reclusive , emotionally detached scandinavian is overblown as fuck . 
  thank mr skeltal for good bones and calcium, 
  no , you 're just annoying everyone by offering insight to something most people would rather leave unchallenged . 
  hey , i just watched the thanet south results on stream and farage even lost his seat there . 
  apparently he had promised he 'd resign if that happened . 
  unexpected turn of event ( for me at least ) . 
  '' die , you goddamn sun lizards ! '', 
  truly breathtaking . 
  maybe it 's just me , but it has been 17 years and imo this movie still has n't received the recognition it deserves . 
  which is much better than the silly worship syriza got during the first ten days after its election . 
  at least now everyone gets to see and consider the other side 's view and arguments . 
  i wish this were the case ( a sweet balance ) with more issues we discuss here . 
  ... and sell it to turkey and russia , 160 billion euro each . 
  that is mostly the church protecting its employees , imho . 
  i doubt they care all that much whether cremation is a violation of the human body . 
  it would be a violation of a monopoly . 
  keep in mind that a priest in greece , in all his holiness and reverence , is getting paid every step of the way . 
  which means that the mourning family will usually ` tip ' him quite generously not only on the day of the funeral , but also on all the other liturgies that follow that . 
  this is very apparent in rural areas of greece ( at least where i come from ) , where people overvalue every single aspect of a religious ceremony and will do their best to find the money a priest will require to not botch the whole thing . 
  i guess the circlejerk has escalated so much , that in a year or so we 'll be hearing how it was ** stalin ** who coerced hitler into committing genocide and gassing the untermensch . 
  twenty-eight were given to yuropoors , prudent , wisest and handsomest of all humans fifty to the yankees , great capitalists and businessmen of the americas and one , one land was gifted to the man vladimirovich , who above all else , desires power . 
  hey it 's good to promote tourism . 
  also since it 's almost summer , the standard summertime song when i was a kid was [ \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03ac \u03a1\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03b2\u03bf\u03cd ( summertime rendezvous ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ielqaux-ig ) the opening goes like : * like an illusion * * you appear before my eyes * * west and east * * the wings of horizon * and the chorus starts with : * summertime rendezvous on your body * * summertime lovin ' ( you ) on the beach * ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  nothing like having 20 yrs old college students whose main job is adding games to their steam collection pointing out how the work of people from any country is inefficient . 
  earthquake-triggered tsunamis are the work of soviet devilry . 
  oh you ruined it . 
  too early man . 
  you should 've waited for a few comments of approval and recognition to appear before posting your vid . 
  besides torrenting , i do n't see a reason to have a 1gbit connection either , otherwise it 's really sweet as it saves you from getting a seedbox . 
  [ yeh , this thread has a lot of potential ] ( https://i.imgur.com/dlhz2jo.png ), 
  fucking caricatures man ... 
  the great illusion of reddit is how americans are convinced that the site is '' anti-american '' . 
  probably an ego thing . 
  this sets a precedent . 
  for all we know , they could then start banning recurve bows , compound bows , longbows or composite bows . 
  it is my god-given right to own all kinds of bows . 
  the magical subreddit of friendship and tolerance . 
  i 'm not sure what europe should do about the matter yet and maybe you 're right , but expelling all illegals just to discourage any future attempts of migration from war-torn/corrupted countries would n't work . 
  you 're thinking this from a '' western '' point of view , in which some libyan guy is sitting on his porch making detailed plans about which country he should move to , baring in mind e.u. 
  's immigration and asylum policy and fully aware of the death count so far . 
  these people just get their families together and hop on a boat . 
  have you thought of the possibility that all expelled immigrants will simply try to come back to europe again ? 
  do you think that if we implement more uncompromising immigration policies , these people will take the boat to brazil instead ? 
  please remove kebab from orbit , space belong to balkan . 
  do you have the nuclear launch codes ? 
  two years ago in greece too ( [ source ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_25/07/2013_511277 ) ) . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ also ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ when ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ was ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ googling ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ that , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ one ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ autocomplete ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ results ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ was ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ '' greece ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ banana ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ republic '' ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ kek . 
  it 's amazing how delusional our people can be sometimes . 
  they honestly thought that a guy like henry kissinger would ever give a fuck about '' ruling greece '' . 
  also , how is it '' hard '' to rule over greece ? 
  given our political and financial state nowadays , it 'd be very easy for a world power to seize the opportunity . 
  and all of it took only 5 years . 
  our imagination 's running wild in this land ... 
  are you referring to [ this news story ? 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/tanzania/11419511/mutilated-body-of-albino-baby-found-in-tanzania.html ) everything about it is so damn horrifying . 
  it 's not like modern greeks are known for their light skin either . 
  like 2/3 of greeks are john kerry white . 
  except for summer , when everyone is christine lagarde white . 
   steven bowman believes that , although the jews were murdered , they were not targeted specifically , in fact : `` such a tragedy seems to be more a side-effect of the butchering of the turks of tripolis , the last ottoman stronghold in the south where the jews had taken refuge from the fighting , than a specific action against jews per se . '', 
  but anyway , it 's really shocking that i 've never heard of this before . 
  probably nowhere to be mentioned on any greek history books ... 
  yeh for instance , that 's exactly why millionaires settle down and stop being greedy after their net worth reaches a certain amount . 
  no wait . . 
  if you add up all the hours that public workers do actual work throughout a week , i 'm sure it wo n't be more than 16 hours/week , so we 're already there . 
  that i can agree with . 
  whatever our current government does from now on is also greek peoples responsibility . 
  on the other hand , not every statement made or opinion expressed by any member of our current government reflects the collective opinion of the whole nation . 
  i 've heard people say all sorts of things and lay the blame on the german government and the e.u. , but i ca n't remember the last time someone seriously suggested that we greeks should demand ww2 reparations . 
  not with talks i had with regular greek people . 
  there 's antisemitism , if you could call it that , but in a somewhat different sense compared to most of europe . 
  the greek who states that he/she does n't like jews is n't your regular '' jew hater '' who would discriminate against , look down upon or verbally abuse some jewish guy he saw on the street . 
  nothing of the sort . 
  it 's that vague , brilliant idea people are into , that there 's a shadow elite ** comprised only by jews ** , whose sole purpose is to destroy the western world and all of europe ** and especially greece ** . 
  at least that 's how i understand it . 
  then there 's golden dawn too of course ... 
  you either have never torrented at all , or you have n't torrented anything since 2005 . 
  there 's about 10 absolutely trustworthy public indexes ( sites ) , and dozens of absolutely trustworthy private trackers . 
  it 's only sketchy if you do n't know where to go . 
  video and audio quality is never questionable . 
  every half-decent uploader posts the bitrate in description , there 's a sample video to watch and there 's sample pictures too . 
  not to mention nfo files . 
  you 're right about waiting time , but nowadays you can automate your downloads . 
  never mind that you can always purchase a seedbox . 
  i 've never heard about 3/6 strikes policy in europe , except for the uk . 
  an isp can throttle your bittorrent traffic in some countries , but i 'm sure users counter that with vpns , 
  no i do n't really consider someone 's flair or try to figure out his nationality so i can respond to him accordingly . 
  i mean , reddit comments are meant to be read by more than one person . 
  and if you view it that way , then i wish i 'd picked another e.u. 
  country that 's still doing business with russia to make my point .
