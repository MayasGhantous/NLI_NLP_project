  you know what , since we 're being so serious about this , then all 6000 german companies doing business in russia should immediately cut off all ties . 
  including the german chemicals industry which is doing business with gazprom . 
  but i 'm sure it 's more important to let a whole country freeze its ass off next winter , while you comfortably throw around the word '' betrayal '' every time you disagree with something . 
  i 'm mostly satisfied with the mods ' actions . 
  especially if we 're talking about the deletion of the threads started by the ukrainian and the finnish dude ( who 's present in this thread ) . 
  i have enough tv drama downloading on my torrent client right now . 
  i do n't need more of it on / r/europe . 
  we do n't have to pretend that what 's happening on an internet forum is all that important anyway . 
  regarding posts with grossly misleading titles which are meant to start a shitstorm or satisfy a certain circlejerk , we do n't need those either . 
  a good example i have in mind is something posted two weeks ago , when there was talk of an imminent coup in russia . 
  someone titled his post '' tanks in moscow now '' , linking to a someone 's fucking ** twitter ** . 
  i 'm glad garbage like this gets taken down . 
  now , i 'm not against having fun and i 'm not against well-meaning circlejerks either , but i want to be able to tell the difference between a 4chan board like / int / and / r/europe . 
  my favourite footage from modern history is [ conrad schumann 's jump ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smv7phb_4na ) . 
  he was an east german soldier , sent to guard the berlin wall on its third day of construction , when the ` wall ' was only a wire . 
  you can see him getting into a west german police car at the end of the video . 
  look at [ his face ] ( https://i.imgur.com/ajcvxox.jpg ) moments later . 
  bring it on !, 
  my ~ ~ body ~ ~ bunker is ready . 
  no , it 's the jewish cultural marxism . 
  little did we know , tsipras ' plans for greece is not to go back to drachma , but to adopt * the shekel * . 
  wake up goyim . 
  it 's exactly because the publishers know that no matter if the content is garbage , people will eventually post it on reddit , facebook , twitter or write about it on their shitty blog , and will therefore circulate on the internet and gain attention . 
  when blackwing lair first came out , it was the most exciting thing ever for me back then . 
  endless wipes on chromaggus and nefarian ... then aq40 , even tougher . 
  tbc was just as good imo , i enjoyed all of it , scc , hyjal and especially black temple ( we never killed illidan ; _  . 
  great content . 
  that was the end for me . 
  i heard decent things about wrath too . 
  hunting diablo clone , doing uber tristram runs hoping to get a perfect pala torch , relentless farming , spending countless hours on d2jsp until i could find a great coronet . 
  good times , ridiculously addictive game ... 
  has this thread been deleted ? 
  i can no longer see it on the front page of / r/europe . 
  that 's just weird . 
  maybe so , but you do realize that from the paragraph in bold , only this : * greek prime minister alexis tsipras is to visit russian president vladimir putin on 8 april , a month earlier than planned * is factual news , the rest : * as the indebted eurozone member state seeks to avoid bankruptcy * is literally just something the bbc added and not necessarily directly relevant to the story ( which in this case , is tsipras meeting with the russian president ) . 
  the rest of the article is speculations made by a greek newspaper [ '' ta nea '' ] ( http://www.tanea.gr/ ) and then some input by [ giorgos christides ] ( https://twitter.com/g_christides ) , a correspondent for der spiegel and bbc world , who 's trying too hard to find a connection between a heavily indebted greece and the meeting of two country leaders ... poorly done in my opinion . 
  look , if you had one shot , or one opportunity to annex everything you ever wanted , one crimea would you anschluss it or just let it slip ? 
  shitposts in / r/europe now . 
  only thing i ca n't understand when someone 's expressing his anger and frustration over the greek government and its actions : why are n't you people just as mad with your own governments and all its decisions from 2002 onwards ? 
  they allowed their countries ' economy integrate and create strong ties and dependency with unreliable , irresponsible countries with corrupt governments and poor infrastructure . 
  everyone 's acting like when there 's a disaster , the blame is to be directed towards the perpetrator only , not to every party involved ... 
  if everyone 's feeling so strongly about greece 's wrongdoings and offenses , why are n't the citizens of all the creditor-countries pushing for a change and a future that does n't involve greece ? 
  or are you too powerless and restrained within this '' union of equals '' ? 
  something 's going down here . 
  lol i do n't know about that , are they now ? 
  that 's interesting . 
  prague is also quite popular here among college students . 
  i know a lot of college students who have visited the city for the sensation festival . 
  quck edit : though the survey seems to be about national groups who live in the czech republic , not people the czechs meet in general . 
  what do 9 out of 10 people enjoy ? 
  a gang rape . 
  it 's simple : anything misleading , inaccurate or straight-up propaganda we do n't agree with is `` extremist propaganda '' . 
  on the other hand , exaggerations and misinformation spread by the side we agree with is : freedom of the press / another point of view / pluralism / [ insert your own hypocritical label ] . 
   modern day greeks live for the now , not for the future . 
  they are opportunistic and often change their minds . 
  there 's absolutely nothing wrong in your statement . 
  it 's a country where people chose nepotism and a client-state to safeguard their positions/wages , over building a rock-solid foundation that would encourage better education/health/social services . 
  of course we 're short-sighted and opportunistic . 
  this is n't what the lto dimension is about though , unless i 'm understanding it wrong . 
  it 's talking about cultures that keep a more casual/healthy relationship with their past , to make way for new ideas and adapt better with the present/future . 
  what 's really weird is that we did n't even make it to the top-3 in the lto dimension . 
  for a society that uses antiquity as a refuge for all the terrible things it has to deal with nowadays , and with a sickly relationship with our heritage and traditions , we should 've topped that one . 
  it only really got depressing when you showed us your dorm room . 
  besides that and the commieblocks , everything looks somewhat gloomy , but there 's beauty in that too . 
  we 've climbed up from the 91st position in 2015 to the 89th this year . 
  things really are changing in this country . 
  so we define ` sane ' as * less authoritarian , non power-hungry , that resembles a democracy a bit more * . 
  but still , there 's no reason to believe that the next government will be any better . 
  the protests , the backlash against corruption and the criticism against erdogan usually comes from the western part of turkey ( often including ankara ) . 
  my point being that the voices speaking for democracy , free speech and separation of powers within turkey is not really a representative sample , just the one covered by western media . 
  they ca n't help the urge to include the meme country in , so everyone reading it can draw inaccurate conclusions from it . 
  the original greek definition was coined up way before the turks . 
  the one we called the turks that was during the ottoman occupation . 
  nowadays it 's for middle-easterns who blow themselves up and for westerner football hools who destroy public property . . 
  these kind of rankings is the reason i cringe every time people from the us and other parts of europe come to / r/greece to ask : `` i 'm visiting [ aegean island ] this summer , am i going to be safe '' ? 
  well yes , a lot safer than walking the streets of your own city , most likely . 
  it 's like , people all over the world are basing their worldview on whatever media hysteria/hype is popular at the time , which is just comical . 
  for the love of god , / r/europe was the only sub i had n't disabled the subreddit style yet . 
  when there 's nothing of substance to add , do n't change something for the sake of changing it . 
  not that i 'm exactly complaining , but yeh , this goes without saying . 
  it 'd be absurd to claim that any government would waste a single cent for `` democracy '' or `` stability '' , if its ulterior purposes were n't profit and political sway . 
  so just another case of journalistic shitposting . 
  you know if the major news websites have n't picked up on something like this after 3.5 hours , it 's because it 's utter bullcrap . 
  always funny to see people on / r/worldnews complain about rt articles being upvoted to the top , when at the same time the frontpage of the sub is filled with independent , cnn , huffington , vice , abcnews , foxnews ... 
  anything just as misleading , as long as the title fits reddit 's worldview . 
  needless to say , rt is often * much * worse , but you can tell all they 're asking is : `` could you please post an article which propagates the western narrative instead ? 
  shit , they have deciphered our moonrunes . 
  still better than being in a deeper-n ' - deeper-crisis trajectory i suppose . 
  how often would an average european get a hold of these though ? 
  do n't they all have their own versions ? 
  personally i like the french and th\u03b5 italian one . 
  except you have no idea what it takes to set up `` giant refugee camps '' in uninhabited greek islands with the resources to host and feed thousands of people ( even under direct e.u. 
  supervision , not greek ) and you 're oversimplifying the task to `` just keep them there until they decide to go back '' . 
  and unless you 've been living in a parallel universe to mine for the past 6 years , we would n't get any substantial debt reduction for it . 
  this is literally a social media echo-chamber building castles in the air . 
  the deal with turkey will be half-assed / migrant camps will be spread out within the greek mainland for several years / greece will barely get the proper funds to handle all this , never mind a freaking ** debt cut ** . 
  everything else is just circlejerking . 
  why would he say something like this a day before the eu-turkey summit , a summit where eu is supposed to focus on pressuring turkey to help us curb the migrant flow ? 
  it 's a plan he knows there 's little chance to be accepted , never mind actualized . 
  so why would he make such a statement a day before the e.u.
