  is expected to stand together to achieve a very specific goal ? 
  this sub is just thirsty for drama and spectacles , as long as it is n't about their own country . 
   bbc reporters are interviewing gd members . 
   say the last thing one should say in front of gd members . 
   they 're asked to leave . 
  people itt are trying too hard to add value to a meaningless incident : `` dae think it could 've ended violently ? '', 
  who knows , who cares ? 
  greeks are always mad about the naming dispute and gd are still dumb nationalists . 
  we did n't even learn anything new from this footage . 
  - find for me the country with a government debt standing at 180 % of gdp , which has been under extreme political/financial pressure for the past 6 years and is able to efficiently patrol and secure its * sea * borders against one of the biggest migration crises of the 21st century , and you might have a point there . 
  - no one 's doubting what is formally written in a piece of paper . 
  do real-life circumstances not call for collective action from more than one country ? 
  if ( very hypothetically ) tomorrow there were a violent coup in russia which triggered a civil war , would you expect estonia , lativa and poland to effectively secure their borders on their own ? 
  would failure to do so mean they 're intentionally dishonoring the schengen agreement , and therefore liable ? 
  - if you have n't already , you 'll soon learn that the turkish gov ' t may not be the most reliable partner to have . 
  your statement and quotation is way too firm and absolute for something that still remains to be seen ... 
  thanks , but i 'm confident that everyone here already understands that the propagandist use of the image meant to imply that . 
  as time passes by and more migrants flock to greece , please remember to post more of that shit to misguide people that we have the means and strength to stop the migrant waves , we just do n't want to . 
  it shifts responsibility nicely . 
  well damn , at this point i think you can find an answer with a simple search query within this sub , where people explain this in 300-words bullet points . 
  download a full bd in mere minutes ofc , 
   this man has no interest in helping refugees as opposed to the european leaders who are all about philanthropy ? 
  i do n't blame either of them , but it 's not a valid accusation either . 
   stand up to him now or it will be worse a year from now . 
  stand up to him for what ? 
  defending his ( or his country 's ) interests at the expense of the eu 's ? 
  what a crime . 
  it 's because of the notion * ` everyone who has an opposing viewpoint to mine must be a paid government shill ' * and * ` everything i agree with and is downvoted was made so by [ evil government ] to suppress them ' * . 
  it 's the childish way to deal with people who disagree with you . 
  besides , most of the comments downvoted itt are raving about the big devious german propaganda machine and are downvoted , where is the `` putinbot army '' to upvote them to high heaven ? 
  it 's exactly the opposite of what op is whimpering about . 
  everyone knows that [ evil left-wing political party that keeps gaining power ] is funded by shady middle-eastern government while [ other right-wing party we 'd rather support ] is funded ~ ~ by corp ~ ~ solely by the spirit of democracy \u2122 and the sheer will to do good . 
   there 's no descriptions of what you 're downloading and usually the worst quality stuff is what is seeded . 
  i disagree with the former , since nowadays even public trackers have film descriptions , imdb links and the youtube trailer link available for the user . 
  i agree with the latter ( if we 're talking public trackers ) . 
  it 's always the worst quality stuff that have thousands of seeders , but since netflix is bitstarving * everything * too by using ~ 5.5 mbps for ** 1080p live-action video ** ( which would be on the midrange even for dvd and simply shameful for compressed hd video ) , well then i think that using quality as an argument when comparing to netflix is senseless . 
   the fact that he still has the authority to launch 2000 nukes makes me super uncomfortable . 
  yeh , as opposed to trusted , benevolent folk like benjamin netanyahu , the pakistani leadership , north korea and the totally stable , non-psychopathic people in usdod , right ? 
  how did the torrenters `` lost the battle '' and piracy is obsolete when there 's trackers with multiple times the content library of netflix , in quality ranges from sd to compressed 1080p , to full bluray discs ? 
  same for spotify ; music trackers have a ** vast ** collection of whatever you can think of . 
  the only one i can think of that made torrenting obsolete is steam for games . 
  this brought back memories from the who aids report fiasco from the very beginning . 
  [ ( 1 ) ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/26/who-apologises-hiv-infections-greece-self-inflicted ) , [ ( 2 ) ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/world/europe/greece-hiv-claim-an-error.html ) . 
  news media get off on human misery and as there 's already been 2 weeks since the paris attacks , they had to come up with a new maymay . 
  i do n't know . 
  i 've never seen ` anti-gay ' camps for teens , faith-healers , conversion therapists and doomsday preachers in greece hehe . 
  i do n't know if that 's what i want to believe or if it 's a fact , but here goes : football ultras/hools mostly consist of poor fuckers who lost the genetic lottery in terms of brain capacity , regardless of nation or culture . 
  remember the dutch football fans who vandalized a fountain and trashed a marketplace in rome a few months back ? 
  i 've met one too many dutch tourists here and that was a shocker for me . 
  * on the other hand * this is still hard to make excuses for . 
  turkey suffered through a similar attack only a couple weeks earlier . 
  how do you not sympathize with france ? 
  you seem to have very strict standards so i do n't know how greek bread would taste to you , but this is my impression when moving from my small village back to the city : all city bakeries just have to experiment endlessly and obsessively and come up with weird tasteless stuff all the time ( and give them names in english ) . 
  why would n't you just stay traditional and safe with the good stuff ? 
  was the bread made by your father , grandfather and his father before him too ` un-cool ' for you ? 
  i never even realized that scorsese actually made a film adaptation of the last temptation of christ . 
  i suppose us born in the 90s mostly know him for goodfellas , cape fear , gangs of ny and the departed . 
  or because he 's directed so many great films in the 70s-80s that maybe it got overshadowed a bit . 
  yeh that has always been a bit too comfortable of a scenario ( for us ) to be true . 
  what we could more confidently take credit for is that the greek victory in the greco-italian war was the first allied ** land ** victory of ww2 . 
  moreover the battle of crete was the first time the german army was met with mass resistance from a civilian population . 
  these two are good enough for me . 
  originally , we do n't even celebrate our * victory * in the greco-italian war in our [ national anniversary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ohi_day ) , but merely our * participation * in ww2 on what could be called '' the right side '' ( the allies ) . 
  i do n't know how we got from that to * greece caused hitler to lose the war * in the internet era lol . 
   a big crowd of people like `` eastern europe '' and then try to attribute them such statements but if it were n't for articles like these , what would give western europeans a false sense of superiority to distract them from their own problems ? 
  ... the greatest caliphate of our time . 
  i remember how i used to think that the unemployment rates are so inflated because young people with third level education would rather stay unemployed than work menial dead-end jobs . 
  the cafe i was working at last year ( small chain of 8-9 cafes around the city ) , the boss would tell stories of how early and mid 20s people would have their parents call the boss and ask him out for a drink or treat him to dinner ... befriend him to hire their kid ... all that fuss for a shitty server job in a cafe . 
  ... and rob halford of judas priest once met freddie mercury in a gay bar in athens ... if that counts . 
  [ second to last paragraph ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/may/20/judas-priest-rob-halford-british-steel ), 
  you should expand southwards ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  personally , i watch everything on my 15.6 laptop , so for 720p i would n't really ask for anything more than netflix has to offer . 
  but hypothetically , for someone who 's been waiting for the new star wars movie since ever and is planning to turn movie-watching into a proper ritual in his 70-inch tv , well then that someone would be disappointed by fullhd @ 7mbit/s . 
  it 's all about where you 're gon na watch it and what content it is . 
  nothing like '' the most advanced compression in the world '' . 
  they use the h264 format , just like everyone else . 
  i 've ` heard ' the video bitrate is only about 4mbit/s for 720p and 7mbit/s for 1080p , so ** if true ** then they 're far from optimal . 
  other reply says they also use h265 ( probably for 4k content ) , but since it 's still in its infancy i do n't know how efficient it is . 
  [ also found this on / r/justfuckmyshitup ] ( http://imgur.com/a/x2fnr ), 
  nearly 23 !, 
  lol . 
  i could more or less understand a 20 year-old guy being a xenophobe or a racist , but if you 're 40 and have nothing better to do with your time than brawl with foreigners , you may have missed about 20 years of developing maturity . 
   all three attackers have a criminal record with local police . 
  lol 'd, 
  there 's almost no countries in the western world where crime is so high it 'd justify people owning guns on a large scale . 
   is useful in any country . 
  people could also install a 1 metre thick steel door in their houses for security or booby-trap their front yard , it does n't mean it would be ` useful ' though . 
   i guess you 're also an advocate of the police not owning guns '' if an ordinary civilian . . '', 
   self-defense  national defense  crime prevention if an ordinary civilian finds himself in a country where owning a gun is crucial for any of these 3 things , then the best course of action would be to sell his gun and get the fuck out of that country . 
  quit your whimpering and go have some byurek . 
  we really suck at complying with german standards . 
  it 's usually not worth knowing why he or they did it . 
  the `` autonomous radical visionaries '' or whatever who are often involved in crimes like this ca n't form coherent ideas anyways . 
  he could personally send you his 20-page manifesto , detailing his incentives , and all you 'd reckon from it would be that he 's a complete moron . 
  those presidential debates are an absolute cringe-fest . 
  these people are so oblivious to how things work in the rest of the world , they might as well be living in another planet . 
   downloading torrents from filelist.ro this . 
  also , if you sign up to a seedbox provider that does n't cap the speeds at 1gbps , you 'll see that you can actually download with even higher speeds than 125mb/s on many private trackers ( 200mb/s + ), 
  that 's a great way for other peers in the torrent swarm to choke you repeatedly , limiting you dl speed to a fraction of what it could be . 
  bittorrent algorithms work with a reciprocation model that penilizes low uploading rates .
