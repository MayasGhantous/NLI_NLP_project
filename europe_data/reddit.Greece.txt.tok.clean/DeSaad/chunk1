yeah , just noticed you said `` i 'd go with '' when previously i had read `` i 'd go ** to ** '' ... my bad, 
  which one . 
  come to greece and try to live like you would in germany without developing high blood pressure . 
  i dare you . 
  then again turks will have a hard time in greece , because negative history and propaganda from both sides affect the common conceptions of each other . 
  sorry , kosovo and macedonia are pretty racist and xenophobic . 
  and this is coming from a greek . 
  yeah what scum , [ he rapped antifascist lyrics like these here , and focused only in his music ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quvgzyrumga ) but because hip hop is being shunned in greece in favor of mainstream trash , he spent more time working at the docks hauling cargo with his scum father ... and when about thirty neonazis came after him and his friends in a cafeteria while they were watching football , he made sure his friends ran away and told them to keep running , and held thirty attackers off by standing in their path . 
  and he took three down before being stabbed to death . 
  what scum ... what a piece of scum , his last words were for his mother and father , to not cry because he lived a good life and they did the best they could ... 
  if only you were half the scum he was ... 
  one should reap what they 've sown . 
  they demanded concentration camps , they should spend their sentences in them . 
  at this point you 're talking from a safe point . 
  you have n't been afraid to step outside in athens with the fear of having your head caved in , or your back hacked with knives into a swastika sign , or been tortured for having stayed under the sun for too long , for even cracking a hitler joke . 
  some people want to repeat parts of history like the holocaust . 
  these people deserve to have some history thrown back at them . 
  i 'd rather they become unemployed and self declared nazis than hidden nazis with authority of life and death over citizens . 
  here 's where it gets extra juicy : the head of the federal agency department that was investigating golden dawn 's criminal ties turned out to be a family relative to one of gd 's parliament members . 
  while the government agents brought report after report of incriminating evidence he collected them all and shoved them under the carpet . 
  as soon as he was discovered a whole trunk full of evidence was finally uncovered . 
  and gd 's ties with the authorities do n't end here . 
  gd 's leader michaloliakos used to be a member of the secret service , and while there he made very deep connections that allowed his party to act undisturbed later on . 
  at least two police officers are directly implicated , one mat ( greek swat ) member , one personal guard , and another person of leading authority . 
  golden dawn are being uprooted as we speak . 
  i sincerely hope they perish in prison , or better yet , in the concentration camps . 
  the members of golden dawn are now being accused of ten murders , but pavlos fyssas ' murder was the catalyst that started this more thorough investigation . 
  pavlos fyssas died a hero , standing up for his friends , and now he 's a martyr who brought down a nazi terror that few of us ever imagined would ever go away . 
  may he rest in peace . 
  yeah . 
  water saves you from lots of troubles , but not from from direct contact with the sun . 
  in the same analogy , being financially secure will not protect you from fascists bent on violence . 
  you 'll just be beaten while carrying a fatter wallet . 
  which will be stolen from you in the end of the ordeal . 
   the problem is not that you are on the sun nobody dies of sunlight , of dehydration . 
  heat strokes , skin cancer , overheating ... 
  drinking water will not protect you from the sun . 
  i ca n't believe i 'm saying this , but this is a lesson we could and should learn from the germans : we absolutely should ban any and all nazi national socialist parties . 
  this matter is being discussed like it 's about freedom of expression , but if the democratic system can be depicted as a human body , golden dawn is what happens when you start chopping your arm off because you do n't like its suntan . 
  just as authorities would intervene and put a person who does a thing under arrest for their own good , and tie them up if they persist in their attempts and try to cure them , so should we ban similar tactics of political parties in the democratic body . 
   good guy hitler   kills hitler . 
  if all members of golden dawn commit suicide before the next elections i 'm voting for them * . 
  ^ * though ^ not ^ other ^ representatives ^ of ^ golden ^ dawn, 
   what does this mean ? 
  you 're being political to the point of unhealthy and counterproductive stubbornness . 
  by exercising your right to have an opinion you are ruining the point of having the right to an opinion . 
  which you have to agree , is very greek . 
  and before you say anything , politics is what you do when you think of a group of people . 
  when your politics allows said group to lose their identity and works against their merriment , it 's akin to cutting off your arm at shoulder length because you dirtied your fingernails . 
  it 's unhealthy to the point of stupidity . 
  `` help !, 
  he 's killing me ! '', 
  `` hey you murderer , stop that ! '', 
  `` but ... but ... my freedom of expression of political beliefs ! '', 
  this is your argument . 
  seriously . 
  a sieve will successfully provide you with a half-shadow , which can help you prolong your stay in the sun . 
  it 's better than no shade at all . 
  no mr. troll ,  [ no , i do n't think the firebombers should get away scot-free . 
  if found they should be arrested , and if the same evidence is found on them and they confess to have analogous connections to any political party , i will hold that political party equally responsible . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1movp1/greece_moves_to_ban_farright_golden_dawn_party/ccbcvat ) you 're obviously trolling . 
  look , if you want to have an honest conversation with a human being , i 'm here and open for one . 
  if you continue in circles i 'm afraid i 'll stop responding . 
  you are still trying to muddle waters . 
  all specific parties that are incriminated by such heinous crimes should be banned . 
  no generalities like `` leftists '' or `` anarchists '' or `` commies in general '' . 
  golden dawn is directly implicated . 
  there is no `` extreme leftists '' party . 
  you are not addressing children which you can confuse with your double talk . 
  identifying with anarchist ideology is not a crime . 
  the article in question has nothing to do with the firebombing , and you 're still trying to muddle waters . 
  no , you want to read that . 
  i ca n't prevent you from doing so at this point , because i could n't have been clearer and yet you still choose to distort my words into the exact opposite meaning . 
  once again , what i am saying , is that : * in athens 2010 : unknown assailants threw molotov cocktails inside a building , and disappeared . 
  the fire , which could have been quelled by any standard means of amateur firefighting , such as fire extinguishing sprinklers , or portable fire extinguishers , instead was allowed to escalate and burn those people alive . 
  the unknown assailants were never caught , and never conclusively proven to be anything besides that : unknown assailants . 
  they are suspected to be anarchists , but nobody knows for sure . 
  * in athens 2013 : a group of neonazis , active members of the golden dawn party were assembled to teach a young man `` a lesson '' after a member of golden dawn happened to witness the young man in a cafeteria , making anti-gd comments in a private conversation with his friend , as they were watching football on the tv . 
  * the young man saw more than thirty thugs coming straight at him , ran for his life , was stabbed multiple times while running , and before dying he identified exactly what happened and gave an exact description of the person who murdered him . 
  the police found the murderer , who moments earlier had phoned his woman at home , and told her to erase all existence of any golden dawn paraphernalia from their house . 
  * the police found tons of incriminating evidence in his house . 
  the murderer confessed to the killings , and after questioning he directly implicated golden dawn . 
  he worked for them for years , as an active member of golden dawn `` patrols '' , where among other thugs he rode around in motorcycles and beat up non-whites . 
  _____________________________________________ * unknown assailants , no connections to anyone besides rumors . 
  * known assailant , direct connections to specific party which preaches hate and violence against non-whites . 
  how are those the same ? 
  no , i do n't think the firebombers should get away scot-free . 
  if found they should be arrested , and if the same evidence is found on them and they confess to have analogous connections to any political party , i will hold that political party equally responsible . 
  until then , it 's rumors vs facts , and nothing else , and the decent thing to do would be to stop diverting attention from the crime that took place . 
  edit edit : the assailants in your edit edit have been arrested and they should stand trial , not as members of the parliament with special privileges , but as ordinary citizens . 
  i ask nothing less of implicated members of gd . 
   pray tell me ftfy as for the main part of your `` argument '' , the firebombing was perpetrated by unknown assailants . 
  let me copy paste from another topic ... http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1mnss9/amazing_scenes_across_greece_and_in_athens_a/ccba5gd in this case , the murderer has not only been caught , he even confessed . 
  this . 
  unsolvable . 
  make them illegal , so they ca n't have any standing in court , then send them to trial . 
  anyone !, 
  i do n't care at this moment . 
  i know that almost half of the police voted for them , but that leaves the other half of the police department to do their duty . 
  golden dawn is a cancer .
