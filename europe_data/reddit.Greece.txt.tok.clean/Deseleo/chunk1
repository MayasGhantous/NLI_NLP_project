there are plenty in athens as well , but we do n't have the same history nor the same tensions . 
  realistically the only countries that can draw some sort of parallels to us in europe are uk and france . 
  well , we were on an island and we primarily hunted birds like blackbirds , chukars , quails etc. 
  some times rabbits and hares . 
  i know some other places hunt wild boars but honestly i do n't know much about hunting at all , i am more into spearfishing . 
  many times during my military service , also my uncle took me hunting a couple of times when i was younger . 
  i think you 're oversimplifying the entire situation . 
  fist off , moving to another country in eu is n't nearly as simple as moving to another state in the us . 
  apart from the technicalities , you have to deal with learning a new language , getting accepted into a new culture and lifestyle ( which might be polar opposite than yours ) , it requires a lot of money and the job market for you as a foreigner is going to be a lot more competitive . 
  the gap between relatively poor countries and very rich countries in your example ( eurozone ) in real life terms is n't as big as you think . 
  being a low wage unskilled worker in germany wont make you king , it might bring you more opportunities for sure , but you 're still going to live day by day just like you did in your old country . 
  low skilled workers usually try to find relatives that already live there in order to help them out . 
  younger generation when they try to move , they might want to study there first and get a bachelors or a masters degree in that country , get connected , see how things operate and then try to apply for a job there . 
  we have many , but they did get reduced throughout time because of katharevousa and because they were mostly present in certain dialects and `` villagers greek '' , that people nowadays do n't really speak anyway . 
  egalement is essential to how the eu functions , especially for the surplus producers anyway . 
  most greeks would probably say [ philotimo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philotimo ) , but it does n't really exist in modern societies anyway . 
  well , in athens if you have a yard large enough that you ca n't take care of it yourself , that means that you probably live in the leafy norther suburbs or in rich coastal southern suburbs . 
  which means that you can probably afford spending some of your tax evading money to hire a landscaping service , lol . 
  pickup trucks are actually common in rural greece , not the american ones , but the japanese ones that are not as big . 
  crossovers ( a mix between an suv and a hatchback ) are also popular in cities . 
  greek women as well , but the majority of people in local beaches are tourists anyway . 
  might be regional , but where i 'm from topless is pretty common . 
  there multiple countries that went through civil war after wwii . 
  also historically speaking europe is n't exactly the most peaceful continent imaginable . 
  for the longest time going to wars was our favorite past time . 
  `` yasou '' literally means `` health to you '' , it is used as an informal hello ( formal is `` yasas '' ) . 
  the expression `` stin hee * yasou * '' meaning `` to your health '' can also be used as `` cheers '' . 
  however the most common is `` yamas '' which means `` health to us '' . 
  the worst part for me is when people on reddit clearly use ee as a slur , but then try to defend it like they actually mean the geographic region . 
  he is an influential director , but i personally am not too fond of this new greek wave of cinema . 
  i do have a soft spot for angelopoulos 's movies , but i 'd say \u0397 \u039a\u03ac\u03bb\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7 \u03bb\u03af\u03c1\u03b1 ( the counterfeit coin ) , because it 's an all time classic . 
  it would be interesting to see if it becomes a trend here . 
  we 're usually quick at embracing shit like that from america , lol . 
   cypres [ \u30fd ( \u0361 \u25d5 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u25d5 ) \uff89 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rijb8wnjcn0 ), 
  i actually like ny accent !, 
  worst thing , it 's not really an accent but i noticed only american girls are doing ( do n't know if it 's regional though ) during a sentence their voice becomes deeper and deeper . 
  like they start talking from the back of their mouth , i do n't know how to explain that , but it 's really weird . 
  there was a transition period . 
  the change did n't happen in a day . 
  for about a year , as i recall , both currencies were on the market . 
  every product/service had two prices , one in euro and one in drachma , you could pay with either , and receive euros back . 
  paycheck was in euro too . 
  by the end of that period drachma was out of the circulation . 
  before that there was also a starter kit , a little plastic bag that contained all the euro coins , so you can get familiar with it . 
  there were also many cheap and some times free calculators you could get that had the euro/drachma button so you can convert currency easily . 
  i still have one of those . 
  football and basketball are all over greece . 
  the third one is kinda taught to judge . 
  volleyball ( both beach and regular ) , tennis , martial arts , track and field , cycling are all contenders . 
  i saw someone mentioning fishing . 
  if that counts as a sport then that 's probably the third one , lol . 
  pakistani and bangladeshi have the stereotype of involving themselves into violent crime and sexual abuse and generally speaking they are not integrated particularly well . 
  obviously , most people are nice and try to get by like everybody else . 
  very possible yes . 
  the expression is '' \u03b8\u03b1 \u03b3\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9 \u03a4\u03ad\u03be\u03b1\u03c2 '' which loosely translates to `` it will be like texas '' . 
  it comes from western movies , where there was a lot of gun fights , violence etc. 
  an example would be \\ - sorry man , i could n't get the work done , i did n't have time . 
  \\ - it will be like texas !, 
  i told you i need it done today !, 
  '' \u03a3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac\u03b3\u03bf \u03b3\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5 '' translates to `` we became chicago '' and it 's similar to the texas one , but used differently . 
  \\ - did you hear about the fight at the club last night ? 
  \\ - we became chicago man . 
  `` american bar '' basically means saloon and the expression would be `` what is this ? 
  american bar ? '', 
  used when you break up a fight . 
  what about switching alphabet but still speaking english . 
  we actually have the same saying about texas in greece along with `` chicago '' and `` american bar '' , but they are archaic at this point , not many people use them . 
  i 've heard that texans are really nice people and let me tell you , if the globalism thing takes off , cretans and texans would get along sooo well !, 
  consumption is measured by liters per 100 kilometers ( l/100km ) . 
  the price is per liter ( $ / l ) . 
  keep in mind that us gallon is different than uk gallon , so the us mpg is not the same as uk mpg . 
  step away europe . 
  haters gon na hate !, 
  which is a shame because unlike cyclades islands for example it has great and diverse nature and places like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofittdkdic ), 
  the argosaronic islands in general are visited mostly by athenians , with the exception of hydra maybe . 
  tourists usually fly from athens or take the boat from piraeus to cyclades or dodecanese or whatever . 
  that 's why there are n't that many in aegina or agistri for example . 
  greece has by far the best olive oil . 
  come at me med bros !, 
  lots of greek islands like karpathos , symi , amorgos , astypalea , thassos , alonnisos , even evia . 
  alot of places in mainland like kavala and nestos river , pelio , kastoria , ioannina , parga , the circle of peloponnese is an experience of it 's own . 
  which is kinda nice because we need to go on vacation as well you know , lol . 
  but what happens when you 're 75 % french and 25 % polish ? 
  do you study 75 % of the french language or 25 % of polish culture ? 
   silence compartment  greece, 
  to be honest the majority of american food chains that opened in greece completely failed , but i would like a mexican food chain . 
  do n't know which one is the most highly regarded though . 
  natural gas non central heating , but the building has oil fired central heating that is not in use . 
  basketball is very popular here . 
  followed by volleyball and water polo at least for team sports . 
  that already has been happening , but to a lesser extent . 
  like when a country has a problem that some other country fixed and has the technocratic knowledge , they ask for halp . 
  eleftherios venizelos might be disliked in turkey , but i am not sure if they even know him lol . 
  most liked probably chinese , south east asians and caucasians . 
  sub-saharan africans are also seen positive but it depends on the region . 
  most disliked probably romani , south asians and some north africans . 
  best integrated albanians , armenians , georgians and slavs . 
  second generation is often impossible to distinguish from greeks . 
  least integrated mena and romani . 
  i would ask him to suggest me a good brandy .
