  how am i being petty for basically agreeing with what your national hero suggested and implemented ? 
  sad news . 
  maybe the redditors that were adamant that turkey is not rolling back into a theocratic society and is pretty far away from countries like iran are starting to reconsider . . 
  if this news is legit , this is quite alarming . 
  why hold muslim prayers in a museum that was built as one of the most famous churches ? 
  it just seems provocative . 
  not cause i 'm greek , simply because it sounds petty . 
  if greece was in the same position with a historic muslim mosque i would n't like to see it being used as a church , it just seems like an asshole move ( [ not like turkey is a stranger to such moves ] ( http://cyprus-mail.com/2015/09/13/the-flag-on-the-mountain/ ) ) . 
  keep it as a museum or as a heritage sight for people to see without altering what it was built as . 
  am i the only one that cringed at the * imagine * reference ? 
  oh the carribean , that explains it . 
  i did n't know you have territory there . 
  til, 
   the mountainous part of the netherlands what new sorcery is this ? 
  looks just like the blue mosque . 
  unless it 's like the asians . . they all look the same to me . 
  ( racist comment of the day , check ), 
  lol no offence taken man . 
  you 're taking this way too seriously bro, 
  what are you talking about ? 
  the minarets are there in the photo . 
  the picture 's display in here is of a smaller size so the minarets are n't shown but if you click on the article they 're there . 
  talk about insecurity . . 
  are you asking to be told the connections between greece and the byzantine empire ? 
  i 'm not sure i understand your question . 
  google could be of great help to you . 
  it did happen in 1453 but it changed relatively recently so that the site 's history and cultural identity can be respected and preserved so the state turned it into a museum . 
  it just seems like acts like this one are made in order to slowly and sneakily bring things back to the way they were and convert it into a mosque once again . 
  why have a `` one day thing '' of religious praying in a museum ? 
  the blue mosque is there and it 's also a huge and wonderful mosque . 
  yeah made me wonder if italy has hornets like spain does, 
  damn . . england without a queen/king . 
  that 'll be a sight . 
  heat amateurs, 
  cool . 
  who wants to notify wiki ? 
  and the world . 
  there 's no point in continuing you keep repeating the same things over and over again , mixing ancient religious folklore with ultranationalist positions and advertising them somehow as the current predominant belief of the greek people . 
  it 's worse than laughable . 
  i 've replied to pretty much everything you write in my previous comments . 
  good talking to ya, 
  give me a government that will actually hunt down and punish all that scum and i 'll vote them even from the grave . 
   no it does not for fuck sake . 
  who are you fooling ? 
  it is called a turkish invasion in cyprus because it became a turkish occupation . 
  to greece ( and the rest of the world ) , turkey did n't simply intervene , it invaded with the purpose to occupy the land . 
  that 's why it ignored the ceasefire and took 40 % of the island while almost 20 % turkish cypriots lived there , and that 's why it brought settlers from turkey to occupy the land . 
  that clearly shows that turkey never meant to intervene , it meant to invade and occupy . 
  it 's not just greece that calls it an invasion ( \u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae = invasion ) , [ unless greece is in charge of wikipedia and i missed the memo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_invasion_of_cyprus ) . 
  only turks are brainwashed enough to believe it was an intervention . 
  that 's how you tried to mask it . 
  it does n't mean we have to accept it as such . 
  we call it how it is . 
  an invasion that lead to an occupation . 
   it became an occupation way later . 
  no it did n't . 
  it became an occupation the moment it began since the turkish troops never left . 
  actually it became an occupation the moment turkey violated the ceasefire . 
  it would have been an intervention if turkey left . 
  but that never happened . 
  so yeah . 
   those are against the treaty and i admit that already . 
  unlike you you are in denial and unable to admit that greece - from the very first day - was already against the turkish operation of attila . 
  that 's why greece never calls it an operation or intervention but rather an invasion . 
  the very first day greece was under a junta regime . 
  what do n't you understand ? 
  they were a basically illegal government . 
  hell , they were partly responsible for the entire thing . 
  however you keep talking about how greece sees it now . 
  and no like i said earlier , no one else calls it an intervention : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_invasion_of_cyprus `` the turkish invasion of cyprus [ 26 ] ( turkish : k\u0131br\u0131s bar\u0131\u015f harek\u00e2t\u0131 , lit . 
  ` cyprus peace operation ' and greek : \u03a4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03ba\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u039a\u03cd\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf , code-named by turkey as operation attila [ 27 ] [ 28 ] turkish : atilla harek\u00e2t\u0131 ) was a turkish military invasion of the island country of cyprus . '', 
   if you accuse people with `` grabbing/stealing lands '' out of the blue , be sure they will retaliate . 
  if you slap people and expect to be kissed on the cheek back , let me remind you : most of the people in the world do not follow jesus . 
  turkey officially talks about greek islands under occupation . 
  greece does not and even the people that `` would like istanbul to be greek '' are not a sign of that . 
  i 'd like paris to be greek . 
  who would n't like paris ? 
  but there 's no way or reason that should happen and i certainly do n't call paris ( or marsaille which was a greek colony initially ) an occupied territory by france . 
  try to understand the difference of people `` missing '' a very old city and of a government officially declaring another country 's lands as occupied lands that should belong to it . 
  you 're trying way too hard . 
  how is anything of what he 's saying a lie or misinformation ? 
  the crisis began in the late 00 's and syriza took over in 2015 after the country was already crippled . 
  obviously the problem had started decades ago but the late 00 's is when it came to light . 
  i 'm not supporting syriza here , i 'm very disappointed by their government but let 's not kid ourselves . 
  the damage done by syriza is not even remotely compared to what pasok and nd did to the country . 
  we did n't get where we are in 2 years of syriza administration . 
  the three lions are cool , i like em but yeah man what 's with the yellow and hearts ? 
  it ruins the whole thing, 
  screw the royalties , i always liked france and their motto against the monarchy ( our countries are close in that matter ) . 
  but i got to say that coat of arms with the fleur-de-lis looks awesome . 
  you sound have sort of kept that anyway and make it symbolise new france or something . 
  i liked the belgium and netherlands ones . 
  ours is alright . . we could sort of 3d it a bit to make it somewhat nicer . 
  hungary has cool laurels . 
  i want these !, 
  mate you 're either delusional or a liar . 
  if you have `` greek friends '' that want to retake constantinople , they 're they same with golden dawn . 
  they 're just afraid to admit it . 
  quit your bullshit and open a different thread if you want to talk about greece retaking istanbul . 
  pretty much noone is interested in that over here .
