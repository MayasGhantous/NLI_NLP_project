  i do n't get why you 're helping prove my point . 
  oh and by the way , the law that was abolished did n't require a doctor 's or official 's note . 
  it was just a `` trust '' based system . 
  either way , i 'm still waiting for you to address `` not using the bathroom you want is the same as black-white segregation '', 
   gavin grimm legally changed his name and gender before a judge . 
  what stops the lady in the picture from doing the same ? 
  also , i 'm still waiting for you to address `` not letting trans people chose their bathroom is the same as segregation '' . 
   not according to the law . 
  how so ? 
  there 's no requirement , also , i 'd like to address the issue of you comparing slavery to trans people picking bathrooms . 
   according to the law , he is a boy . 
  in fact , according with the supreme court too http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2017/02/24/supreme_court_reprimands_groups_for_misgendering_gavin_grimm.html right , and the picture i showed you above is of a woman . 
   just like they wanted to decide segregation , marriage and slavery . 
  getting to pick and chose your bathroom is even remotely similar to any of these . 
   just like slavery , segregation , interacial , and same-sex marriage . 
  he killed the case before scotus was going to hear he did n't kill any case . 
  he let states decide . 
   must be the extra right to a boy use the male bathroom . 
  lmao yeah i hate to break to you but you are n't a boy if you have xy , male primary and secondary sex characteristics . 
  you also should n't be catered to over 99.7 % of the population . 
  yeah , and [ maria ] ( http://silencedmajority.blogs.com/.a/6a00d834520b4b69e201156f3585cc970b-pi ) here is legally female but she ca n't use the women 's bathroom either . 
   throw his case away forever . 
  no he did n't . 
  he handed it down to the states . 
  transgender people are entitled to equal rights . 
  they are n't entitled to extra rights . 
  not even remotely comparable . 
  and if you think having to use the bathroom that matches your sex is the same thing as segregation you 're insane . 
  trans people have n't lost any rights . 
  they still have the right to use the bathroom that matches their sex . 
  it 's not a right to use whatever bathroom you want . 
  if you want to know what he is talking about check my other comment on this chain [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5ys8jh/the_dutch_are_nazi_remnants_erdogan_bbc_news/detrmic/ ) . 
  i 'd repost it , but it 's a bit of a wall and would look stupid . 
  godamn it , i hate it when people force me to defend trump by lying/being dishonest about him . 
  he did n't destroy trans rights . 
  he allowed states to chose whether they want to allow people to chose their bathroom , which means some states will still allow it . 
  even if he did ban trans people from using whichever bathroom they felt like today , that is n't a right he 's taking away . 
  it 's not your right to pick and choose what bathroom you want to use . 
  nevermind how this law was horribly implemented . 
  all you had to do was say `` i 'm trans '' . 
  no verification or doctor 's note required . 
  so no . 
  he did n't destroy trans rights . 
  he abolished a law with a botched implementation and handed it down to states rights , which as a republican he is favour of , smaller government and all . 
  i heard he wants to gas the muslims and put mexicans in work camps . 
  no need for the / s, 
  it 's because spain has a lot of independant movements of it 's own then ? 
  can you elaborate a bit ? 
  why doese n't spain like independant countries ? 
  why does spain hold beef with scottland ? 
  the comments on this subreddit read like a polandball comic . 
   morally objectionable i think these actions are long pased the point of `` objectionable '' . 
  but is n't that racist ? 
  it 's not an ad hominem . 
  your only arguement is an imaginary glass ceiling . 
   women are still underrepresented across a wide range of disciplines . 
  how is it inequality if women do n't care about certain fields ? ... 
   what you stubbornly refuse to understand , at least from what i gather from your replies , is that changing the legislation and regulations to grant and ensure the marginalized groups the rights everyone long ago have had does not make the opression dissapear . 
  it still exists in the fabric of society , in the interactions between people . 
  it 's a lot more subtle , arguably invisible to those who are not subject to it . 
  so i understand it may be hard to concede it exists . 
  be careful . 
  you got so much hot air in your head you struck the glass ceiling way too hard on your way up . 
  it was a joke . 
  so , men are n't discriminated against in quotas purely on basis of their sex ? 
  i do n't consider abortion murder why would i ? 
  the fetuses do n't feel or think and do n't even look like humans early on . 
  although , i do consider , actually born children dead murder . 
  education like `` do n't use condoms because contraception is a sin '' in aids riddled africa . 
  do n't forget racist . 
  despite islam not being , y' know . 
  a race . 
  holy shit , i read more about it . 
  it 's pretty easy to guess . 
  you know , considering that discrimination against men is mandatory while discrimination against women is illegal . 
   black transgender lesbian wheelchair-bound troglodyte you forgot wolfkin thorian triple headmate system . 
  they knew he was coming and were locked onto him . 
  they chose not to shot him down . 
  they murder babies ? 
  discrimination against women and gays and death threats are illegal . 
  meanwhile , discrimination against men is not only legal , buy encouraged . 
  here 's the thing . 
  there is no feminist struggle in western society . 
   are there many other hroups of leople so exposed and as many people ready to express vocal opposition/hate to them ? 
  when a local knitting group decides to have a parade , is it customary for them to recieve ( death ) threats ? 
  is there a lot of people commonsensing it eith ' i mean , let them knit , but knitting in public is totally asking for getting beaten ' ? 
  yeah . 
  both of which are illegal you know . 
  meanwhile , it 's completely legal to disciminate against a man purely based on whether he 's a man or not . 
  in fact it 's mandatory .

  if we can pull off 2 % , none of you are excused . 
  regardless , to anyome wondering why greece 's spending is so high , it 's because turkey . 
  really that explains most of it . 
  there a lot of dispute over greek clay and fear that turkey might try to pull some shit with the outer islands in the aegean sea . 
  that 's not a style , that 's being a cunt in general . 
  try visiting r/politics instead . 
  what is that ? 
   there is more to a system than government quite often they can be ahead or behind the public mood .
