  most often behind because elected governments do n't like unpopular ideas because it loses them votes . 
  half the voting population is women . 
   not really both women and homosexuals have faced historical oppression and that oppression does n't just stop because of change in the laws . 
  how is a woman or a homosexual oppresed at a modern western country ? 
  systemic implies the system is against them . 
  there are no laws holding women back and there are laws in place to make it illegal to do so . 
  in some countries there are even laws that make it legal to discriminate against men , like hiring quotas . 
   it is like assuming that homosexuals are equal because they have same sex marriage . 
  apples and trucks . 
  litterally . 
  and no , homosexuals are not missing any rights either . 
  there is no systemic oppresion in most countries . 
  nobody excludes women from holding power . 
  there are no laws against women holding power and half the population is female . 
   there 's generally a ceiling career wise the ever popular glass ceiling . 
  i was n't aware there were laws forbiding women from holding power . 
   much less freedom for women oh shit , what rights are women missing ? 
   but what 's sad is that studies show that a significant proportion of women living in patriarchal societies would also like to be men . 
  i 'm going to call bs on that unless i see a credible large scale study . 
  women in europe and the us enjoy immense benefits and rights over men like prison time , custody suits , less suicides as shown , hiring quotas ect . 
  saying that a majority wish they were men sounds inane . 
  and the other half are circlejerking too hard to comment . 
  his comment being to insult anyone who disagrees with him ? 
  you should visit r/politics . 
  they 'll upvote and gild the article of a comment any random wanker in the street made as long as it 's anti trump enough . 
  i do n't know why i did n't get that earlier , i feel stupid, 
  that subreddit is litterally a karma farm for r/europe . 
  where 's the red one , i ca n't find it . 
  oh , isle of man . 
  i thought they spoke english . 
  same sex marriage is legal in greece ? 
  i 'd swear i thought we only allowed civil unions . 
  what 's the joke ?

   do you have anything besides hot air to back those `` it 's the russians ! '', 
  treason and corruption claims up ? 
  [ we have footage . 
  every single le pen voter is bigoted and racist ? 
  and hillary helped secure their vote with the bucket of deplorables comment . 
  she dismissed half the base and insulted them at the same time . 
  she helped rally them . 
  more like [ `` i 'm a woman '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xldqptorr28 ) did n't work for hillary . 
   always based on feeling and zero rationality . 
  dismissing an entire batch of peole as stupid/idiots/bigots is one the reasons hillary lost . 
  the `` look at the other guy he 's worse , all my policies are that i 'm not him '' did n't work for hillary vs trump , what makes him think it 'll work for him vs le pen ? 
  i dislike it when blantanly sensetionalist propaganda makes it to the front page of this sub . 
  regardless if you agree or disagree with it . 
  `` look at all these bad people supporting a bad candidate , i 'll compare it to a slightly visually similar but mostly different sitiuation to point out how bad i perceive these people and how bad this candidate to be while insulting them in the proccess , point and shame them for supporting him because i believe they are bad . '', 
  what the fuck is this , buzzfeed ? 
  it 's not bad only for bad grammar , it 's generally titles that are phrased in a weird way . 
  for examples , this title implies that thanks to the estonians somebody is pumping out models and they somehow helped with that . 
  which bot ? 
  r/titlegore thanks to estonia , who produces most models per capita ? 
  this is n't a joke by the way . 
  people who visit from northern countries without a lot of sun may face serious health issues if you do n't use proper protection . 
  the sun can seriously fuck you if you 're not careful , especially if your body is n't used to it do n't be discouraged though , just take proper precautions and you 'll be fine . 
  this title reads like it was taken straight out of r/politics . 
  how do you get a negative population ? 
  conscription is mandatory for all males here when they reach 18 here ( unless they have 2 children and a wife ) . 
  you go through a physical and are asigned a status depending on how healthy you are , disabled people and people who have had stuff like heart surgery are excused . 
  women can optionally sign up .

  my pronouns are `` the master '' instead of he and `` master 's '' instead his .

  france is faguo . 
  is that joke too old for 2017 or is it still relevant ?

   and orthodox wait really ?

  go back to r/politics, 
  latvia burns potatoes for fuel . 
  it 's not really propaganda , seems exaggurated but fairly neutral . 
  oh come on , there 's some dispute over tesla but this a joke . 
  everyone knows this picture is of the famous greek general \u039d\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u0392\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 . 
  what ?

  latvia can into potato yes ? 
  progressive . 
   yes . 
  federal troops actually integrated little rock high school after the governor of arkansas tried to block black students from entering in 1956 so quite literally , yes . 
  from an outside force . 
   you need to lay off the shows and movies and online shit that does n't tell you much besides ' murica bombs brown people ' yeah , but i still have n't single a single example of the united state army defending america 's freedom instead of just killing poor people .
