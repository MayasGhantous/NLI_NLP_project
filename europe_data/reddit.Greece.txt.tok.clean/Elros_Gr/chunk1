i linked the wikipedia article.too much stupidity in that war too recount it all at once . 
  here in greece its intertwined with 3 more wars and what was an unofficial civil war . 
  [ first balkan war ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_balkan_war ) in which greece , montenegro , serbia and bulgaria fought against the ottoman empire . 
  [ second balkan war ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_balkan_war ) in which montenegro , greece and serbia fought against bulgaria over the spoils of the first one , with romania and the ottoman empire joining in later ( vs bulgaria ) . 
  the schism in greece between king constantine : admirer or the german reich but wanted neutrality and pm eleutherios venizelos : strong proponent of entente , he thought maritime supremacy of entente would prove victorious and saw wwi as last chance for greece to reclaim constantinople and asia minor coast . 
  venizelos prevailed ( with some `` help '' from entente ) and we [ joined ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/greece_during_world_war_i ) . 
  after wwi we resumed fighting vs the ottoman empire in a [ war ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/greco-turkish_war_ ( 1919 -- 22 ) ) which resulted in 3000 years of greek presence in anatolia being effectivelly terminated and is our greatest shame during our modern history . 
  thing is the families targeted are all greek.if you combine this with a dubious statement by albania 's pm ( i think ) , you get diplomatical crisis . 
  ofc our numbers would be high.we even have songs lamenting that drugboats got seized at ports . 
  '' \u03a4\u03bf \u03b2\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b9\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03ba\u03b5 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u039a\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03b8\u03af\u03b1 '' . meaning '' the boat from persia got caught in corinth '' . it wasnt carrying persian rugs thats for sure !, 
  we are surrounded.send help !, 
  good one !, 
  so what you are actually saying is that vienna was the heart of the hapsburg empire.how is it the heart of the balkans when you only refer to serbs , croats and bosnians ? 
  i would agree if you were talking about late 19th-early 20th century . 
  when i move abroad that average is gon na jump up good.just to secure our position . 
  we never wanted to leave eu.the only exit that was considered was from eurozone . 
  i have read similar things but i can not attest to their validity . 
  hahaha.i had never thought of that , thank you . 
  amen . 
  yeah i know of this as well , but the article is talking about hellenistic times.rome was a bit later . 
  i guess we shall know in due time.or maybe never.interesting non the less . 
  i think the article is implying that contact preceded the roman empire.it was during hellenistic times . 
  or as i like to say it : '' ** suck ** it venetians '' . 
  i wish i was so optimistic.so far the opposite has happened . 
  '' massively '' . have you been there ? 
  thats more like it.better than a refugee city . 
  good job eu, 
  you are propably correct.i dont know where i got it , but i always thought giving sanction meant giving refuge to someone . 
  i offered ~ ~ sanction ~ ~ sanctuary not wealth . 
  dont be mean.if we were ruled by a crazy dictator i would like our neighbours to be welcoming . 
  holy shit he is going all kim family on us . 
  attention westernturks , you are more that welcome here.quickly before the greece - turkey border turns into dmz with a minefield . 
  its like being on a ride that never ends.we are on the top , mom , we made it !, 
  what the actual fuck . 
  yes it is.press the red button and it will take you straight to mexico city.tequila and tacos included.vamos !, 
  lol, 
  i agree but i am just 1 person.change comes slowly if at all . although for better or for worse we are forced to change now . 
  thats a nice thing to look forward to.i want to feel optimistic but we got a few things to fix/change both regionally and in the eu . 
  xd indeed . 
  for the sake of the british people , i hope your politicians fix their shit.here we know too well what happens when you have bad leadership . 
  oh well , its politics man.i never blamed only german politicians.politicians at their best will seek what is beneficial/profitable for their country/voters . if we had stronger/better politicians we wouldnt be in this mess . 
  we need to be strong enough to stand shoulder to shoulder with our partners.if you are weak you get bad part of the deal . 
  cmon guys , he cant be that bad.he recently visited mt athos.he is orthodox like us . 
  oh hey look he is in athens . 
  he is in my home . 
  ` hello mr. president '' . bit too close for comfort . 
  `` wait this is my house you cant take it.this is my stuff !, 
  ! what do you mean you lend it to me for a while , but it actually is rightful russian clay ? '', 
  '' noooo , not to the gulag ... '', 
  the first two parts i know about.the last no.well i guess we could chalk this up to the transitionary period between vote and actual brexit . 
  with so many ( crazy ) things happening since the vote , uk related and others , its really hard to remember that 48 % of brits wanted to stay.we like to circlejerk and be demeaning to brits , nowadays , on r/europe but its really sad : / . 
  well they arent selling it just to us  . and its funny that us borrowing loads of money and not having a solvent economy never bothered them when we were buying weapons from them  . 
  exactly.soon they wont have any say in it.we can pave the way while they are in and implement after they go . 
  period of temporary ( hopefully ) insanity?or period as in the west is getting rid of useless/harmful entities from her body ? 
  what drugs is he on ? 
  i feel after brexit vote he fell on hard drugs , hence his behaviour . 
  or was he like this before ? 
  if i could chime in , as a greek i would welcome this if we got the eu airforce to be based or have an airforce base here . 
  maybe that would finally deter the turks from violating our fir ( airspace basically ) . seriously the mini cold war era arms race we have with turkey is draining a lot of our gdp.although germany and france sell us our equipment , so they might have a vested interested to keep this going . 
  whats up with greece ? 
  only 2 % ? if we judge only by public schools ( most people here take private lessons to really learn a language ) we learn 2 foreign languages.english is conpulsory and then you choose either french or german depending on the school . 
  weird stats . 
  edit : i just checked.it says they only asked people older than 15 . we only get english and french/german lessons in high school which is 13-15 . maybe thats why the stats are so skewed . 
  wtf are you talking about ? militarily occupy a sovereign nation so we can make a migrant city in it ?? 
  do you read what you write ? 
  thank you very much for this.why is everyone supporting orban in this.i made fun of his suggestion and said fuck him and it spawned a shitstorm . 
  maybe.but the syrian conflict cant last forever . 
  i dont know how the future will play out.we can only make guesses and projections . 
  not greece ofc.the eu.greece doesnt have enough political capital for this.but the eu as a whole does . 
  no and there wasnt a good enough plan in place , hence the clusterfuck . 
  its further than european cities though . 
  yeah i agree.maybe we should negotiate with their country of origin to take them back , if they are economic migrants . 
  ok but are we ( me and you ) qualified to judge what they deserve ? 
  i am not suggesting hand them big houses and keys to mercedes.just to make sure they are treated like people . 
  yeah i didnt mean solve it generally . 
  but i wont take kindly solutions from someone sitting behind walls , giving advice.my disagreement is more with orban than his `` solution '' . 
  not all of them.some of them will agree with you.but some others have said they would do it again . 
  and no i dont aim to solve global problems.we could negotiate with their home countries , secure deals to send them back ( not syria while its at war ) . 
  i dont know a perfect solution.i admit to not being well versed in this.but it doesnt seem right to treat people as burdens to be put out of our view . 
  so the chinese arent living normal lives?japanese neither ? 
  normal life is safety , health , family , inclusion in society , education , happiness , etc.you dont mean to tell me you can find these only in the western world ? 
  i am sorry but this reeks too much of isolationism.we are part of this world if we distance our selves from its problems , it wont end well . 
  just look historically all the nations that tried it.japan ( sakoku ) , china ( ming & qing ) , ussr , etc. i would prefer the eu last and not fall victim to same old shit . 
  how does normal life equate to western ? 
  there are many ways of life . 
  lets be honest here.this doesnt solve the problem.it just moves it somewhere far from `` us '' . out of sight , out of mind . 
  is it though ? 
  how will they live ? 
  work ? 
  get educated ? 
  enjoy a normal life like we all deserve?maybe it could work short-term . 
  but to be honest , i dont think handing off the problem to someone else is going to solve much . 
  i dont advocate getting them in unchecked either.remember they pass through here . 
  i dont know.it just seems a bit inhumane to treat people needing help like pests . 
  yes there are `` bad '' mixed with normal people , but still . 
  is it so simple though ? 
  will money be enough ? 
  is it a longterm solution ? 
  i dont know man , this just seems like a way to transfer the problem not solve it . 
  you presume much , i think .
