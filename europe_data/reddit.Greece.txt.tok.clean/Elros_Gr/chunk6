  it , this crisis broke us !, 
  at least we can have orgies to praise dionysus and apollo again !, 
  edit : i read the part where they smeared feces in the church . abort !!, 
  ! abort !!, 
  from the sinister depths of tumbler he emerges to create a safe space for all the special snowflakes !, 
  turkish news have become a nice pair to u.s.a. news . the latter is mind boggling violence while the former is mind boggling stupidity !, 
  a surreal escape from the dying throes of our economy . 
  thank you guys , 
  wth turkey . wow their politicians act like the little kid throwing a tantrum when its parents scolded it for putting shit in his mouth . 
  meuh , idiots will be idiots . 
  personally i blame the newspaper for making it news . 
  no matter how ridiculous something is it doesnt matter till you make it matter, 
  i can feel the cringe all the way across the aegean . 
  if any turk does n't feel like staying there while the sultan is in power , come on over . we will drink raki , eat meze and hope for a future when powerhungry moron politicians wont stand in the way of progress . 
  i think he must have found out the prostitute he was fucking was over 18 . 
  life 's hard man . sometimes they look 15 but they are adults : /, 
  thank you !!, 
  . everyone should play paradox games to have that etched in their mind !, 
  dont forget about sk\u00e5ne man . 
  not only they left the party they came back shortly after and took part of your house :p, 
  i understand what you are saying . 
  during the first balkan war the army had a choice . 
  go to manastir and capture the area you refer to or go to thessalonica before the bulgarians did . 
  the heir apparent ( general of the army ) wanted to go to manastir but the prime minister ordered him to go to thessalonica . and so he did . 
  the rest is history . 
  its kinda sad to see that despite being allied vs turkey ( greece , montenegro , bulgaria , serbia ) that didnt last and we ended up fighting again . 
  damn balkan peoples always fighting with each other :p, 
  we are pretty cool with most slavic peoples . 
  with some of them we share more history ( russia , serbia , bulgaria ) than we do with the others.slight problem with fyrom guys . 
  someone knocked them on the head pretty hard and they dont know who they are . 
  yay !!, 
  rational decisions and democratic process is being considered `` superior mind '' . 
  at least he is self-conscious about that !!, 
  yeah i get what you are saying . i figured as much that most people are decent . makes my decision to come live in germany feel better.we fan learn from each other . 
  its our secret colony from ancient times . dont tell anyone . we plan to go there if shit hits the fan . more than now ofc . picture kebab invasion coupled with bad italian olive oil hitting our markets, 
  if you really think this , you just have never come here . do we have idiots or desperate people blaming anyone from aliens to god and in between ? 
  sure we do . but most of the people you meet from here wont treat you badly , 
  i dont think this would work . european solidarity doesnt exist . the smaller ethnicities or poorer economies would get trampled . look at whats happening with greece . even since the crisis started we have been looked down on and exploited ( the people of greece not politicians ) . 
  yes we have made mistakes . we have partaken ( some of us ) in economic corruption . but the punishment is disproportionate to the crime . the majority of the bailout money has gone to european and greek banks . the people have seen none.yet every once in a while the troika ( with the agreement of our politicians ) chokes our economy with more taxes and austerity measures . i am not an economist but less money ( fewer jobs ) / more taxes is a slow death . 
  maybe i am just bitter or a cynic . but if the european peoples want a federation use what happened / is happening as an example to avoid !, 
  oh didnt know . thanks for telling me , 
  apart from any religious reasons this has been the status quo for mode than a 1000 years . 
  e.r.e gave them this privilege , ottomans reaffirmed it and the greek state when we took back the region.neither for it or against it but i dont see it changing in the next millenia.just a local weird political arrangement, 
  easy enough . 
  they ( we ) speak english with a unique greek accent unmistakable to noone to has spent time here . oh , and they speak greek to each other ( that wasnt obvious at all ), 
  '' what is for lunch today mom ; '' , `` the decaying corpse of our economy m ` boy . eat up before the maggots get to it '', 
  upvoted for portraying the eu as a bull spain is trying to fight !, 
  he has a lot of blood in his hands and he had many flaws yes but to compare churchill to hitler is ludicrous.i understand why an indian would feel something like that but he takes it to an extreme level . 
  the ancient and '' formal '' name for wine in greek is '' \u039f\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 '' . which i imagine has the same proto-indoeuropean roots as the rest ( most ) . 
  ancient greece wasnt a country by any measure but you stroke my ego so i will let it pass !, 
  come on man we arent gon na win another one for 100 years.give us this one !, 
  not only.swedish empire , dutch republic , french empire.i have seen quite a few posts with western europe . 
  its all the greek olive oil they import and sell as their own i am sure !, 
  * triggered * !!!!!!!!, 
  ottoman cannons cant melt theodosian walls.the fucking anti-papists did this !!, 
  jealous western europeans wont upvote this post !, 
  when are we getting them in rainbow 6 : siege ? 
  the only similar thing they have is that you drink both of them cold . 
  meuh not sure , freddo espresso is pretty dominant in greece these days.frappe is dying . . 
  what a bunch o ' dicks !, 
  hey , i recognize these names from eu 4 . 
  thank you paradox , for making me good at geography . 
  now ask me where ** mysore ** ** vijayna ** gara is  !!, 
  i would like to reserve golden horde !, 
  oh so this is n't exclusive in greece xd, 
  the moomins.really awesome kids show !, 
  here in the south as well.i loved it as a kid.even though i couldnt understand a thing . 
  the more you know !!!, 
  its polish bro , made during the cold war . 
  y i used to watch it a lot in the late 90 's . 
  in greece as well.its was pretty neat.some other cartoons from the former ussr states were also kinda neat , such as nu , pogodi ! . 
  glorious ussr kid 's show . 
  i still remember the episode where they seized the means of production !, 
  very thorough,eye-opening article.thanks a lot of translating it . 
  yeah , just done marinading the lamb ribs with my father.gonna roast them in an hour or so.i love this day !, 
  more excuses to put meat on a grill !!!, 
  edit : i can barely move ... 
  not as much in greece but when you go out ( in places ) as a non-smoker , you are surrounded by smokers . fuck that !, 
  finally.a less serious comment in this thread.thank you for that !, 
  oh!and take that habsburgs !, 
  ok i will just watch people i dont know closely then.i hope they wont mind xd . 
  rofl , good one xd.the thing is not only danes are pale.finnish , germans , brits ( although they are easy to tell apart ) , norwegians etc. . 
  they even did it in greek.how can we not help them ?? 
  idk how we can tell that they are danes specifically.maybe we should apply it to everyone we see without protection !, 
  another wednesday.same old . 
  can confirm , last time i was up there i saw new zealanders living in a palace !, 
  what is the solution when someone owes money ? 
  give them ( a shit tonne ) more.and ofc force austerity so the economy can recover !, 
  ! brilliant.a poor southern saved.now on to another !!, 
  photos were really not flattering back then . 
  oh ok , then ireland deserves part of the condemnation !!, 
  i am sorry i do n't recognise the person in ireland.might be i am behind in celebrity news ? 
  well someone drew a line and if u are below it u are the same.people should get that balkan is the name of the peninsula , it doesnt necessarily describe the people living in it . 
  i think the balkans are a bit less homogenous than this map suggests.how on earth are greeks more similar to slovenes than they are to italians ? 
  damn you op.why you put a jumpscare in your thumbnail.cheap trick !!, 
  looks like someone clicked the wrong trade offer.now you must wait for the diplomat to return and a month ( eu 4 ) before you can do it the right way !, 
  wow look at the uk.we dont need that shit in the eu !, 
  thanks a bunch for the link , i just finished watching it , really frightening/enlightening . 
  shhh , dont tell anyone ... ... 
  ahh to be young and full of dreams !!!,
