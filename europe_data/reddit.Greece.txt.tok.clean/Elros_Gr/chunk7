  i remember when i was that age i had more modest goals.like getting rid of my sister and getting a gameboy colour with pokemon red.sweet innocent years . 
  well we have always called you '' \u03a4\u03c3\u03b5\u03c7\u03af\u03b1 '' ( czechia ) in greek . 
  europe is in love \u2764 !, 
  it must have been a tremendously proud day for the german people but that and what followed ( germany humiliates france ( 1870 ) , france humiliates germany ( 1918 ) , germany humiliates france ( 1940 ) ) shows clearly that despite its flaws the eu is one of the best things to happen for europeans . 
  whether is flourishes/improves or dies away its up to us . 
  well the euro is basically the deutchmark . 
  same with greece.adopting the euro was a big mistake.we lost so much purchasing power with that . 
  as i understand it economics and politics are a lot more complicated but you got some points right . 
  i would encourage anyone who has the time , to watch the whole interview.its a bit over an hour on the rubin report channel.might shed some ( more ) light on what happened/is happening in greece . 
  you mean after the netherlands declared independence from hapsburg spain ? 
  how can each development be worse and worse ? 
  when is enough power enough ? 
  sometimes i envy the northernmost countries.they are so far away from all kinds of shit we have had to put up throughout the ages.its not enough that we ( greeks ) always fight with our selves we also had so much outsider interference . 
  i have an idea.lets take greece and move it to the north sea !, 
  looking forward to 50 years later when the '' cyprus issue '' will still be an issue.thank you erdogan . 
  btw when is the next coup incoming?lets pool resources and make it happen !, 
  last one shows nicely how we ( greece ) are both part of east and west with a more rooted cultural affinity to the east and a more `` forced '' affinity ( since the modern greek nation ) to the west . 
  can we contrast this with the christmas photo where there was sunshine in athens ? 
  oh no you didnt , you little shit !!!, 
  i think they replaced the word propaganda with the word culture.must have been a typo !, 
  red means good . . right ? 
  greeks as well , bro . 
  wow this is brilliant !, 
  maybe the person gathering the information asked how much we liked ** german ** finance minister sch\u00e4uble and not germany as a whole . 
  hey china gets about the same as the usa from us . which is weird.must be obama 's visit . 
  edit : we like russia a lot more . 
  well we voted for them.sadly this is partly our fault . 
  i thought shitposting was supposed to remain on the internet !, 
  [ \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03b1 ] ( http://imgur.com/a/k6kiu ) from greece.happy holidays to all of r/europe and beyond !, 
  so this is russia 's `` 50 ruble army '' ? 
  wow these divide posts are getting darker.i am including the `` traianon treaty '' one for hungary and the `` post-wwii germany occupation zones '' one . 
  hey i have a picture of the [ guy ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/7f/95/38/7f9538134ba2efde7727edbd348892cd.jpg ) that made that decision . 
  this was posted again a few months ago . 
  same thing that happened in greece after the arrest of members on '' golden dawn '' . 
  christmas man sounds like an awesome superhero if you are a kid.but he gets lamer the older you get and have to buy your own gifts : /, 
  great !, 
  i loved the moomins as a kid.when i sit and think about it the cartoons i watched where from all over the place.ussr , usa , finland , japan , france , belgium , poland etc. 
  they wont.the politicians wont let them.my cousin in riot control ( \u039c.\u0391.\u03a4 . ), 
  tells me they know who does this shit , they are the same every time , but are never given the order to clean house.there are certain areas ( \u0395\u03be\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 ) and universities ( which police are banned from entering ) that the anarchists go to `` hide '' and the police are always stopped , by orders , to enter . 
  too bad there arent any greeks left to `` burn '' the parliament.i guess kurds will do . 
  that not debt relief thats delayed payment . 
  no worries.a un resolution and an eu condemnation should teach those buggers !!, 
  if you are good at something , namely misinformation and clickbaiting , never do it for free !!, 
  '' enjoy a dick in greece '' paraphrasing a motto for tourism ` enjoy your myth in greece ' . 
  golden dawn wont win.before the crisis they were nobodies.they have gained a lot of traction compared to before the crisis but they have proven with their actions that they are thugs.sure there are some fascists or supremacists that believe what they preach but the majority of their voters are just disgruntled and desperate . 
  no worries we mostly blame our own politicians , some german politicians , and if you happen upon someone who has thought it through , ourselves . 
  yeah , the situation isnt getting any better . 
  of course not.i was just pointing out that there is a lot of frustration in and out of the camps.and i mean the refugees and the local populace , not the neo-nazis . 
  to be fair refugees have also burned parts of their camp.2-3 weeks ago furstrated that their applications were taking so long they burned down the office that was processing them.seems that noone likes the camps . 
  do not worry good neighbours.i swear we dont have secret bases where we hide the extra stuff.i swear we havent found the [ marble emperor ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/constantine_xi_palaiologos ) and working on ressurecting him . 
  lower your military spending more please.buy gyros not weapons.we like peace.our f-16 's do as well . 
  what are we without customs ? 
  btw he doesnt look happy . 
  he looks like he thinks ' i told you so ' !, 
  wow reading these comments is sickening.so fuck italy and greece right ? 
  not everyone 's problem right ? 
  you bunch of hypocrites.everyone is fine acting like a humanitarian as long as the problen is far away ... 
  noice.sacrifice the southern countries when it was merkel that opened the floodgates . 
  \u0391\u03c3\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 ( aspasia ) ? that 's an ancient greek name.how come the product is named after it ? just curious !, 
  yeah , palaiokastritsa beach especially.the water was so cold and clear !, 
  considering the kind of people he puts in them they are propably more democratic than the rest of the country . 
  top 10 memes that went too far !, 
  ** austerity ** is the key to all of this . 
  ** if ** we can get it working ( on greece ) . cause ** sch\u00e4uble ** is a funnier ( * insert his face * ) character than we ever had before !, 
  that was athens a couple of weeks ago.now its just 37 c !, 
  woops , i might have been hungry when i wrote that . 
  top ten anime betrayals !, 
  eyyy , shoutout to my home town of pidgeon ( peristeri ) . 
  only the toughest palikaria are bred here as the name clearly indicates !, 
  not true.i think you meant mount athos , which is in a completely different area . 
  you are no fun , mods.a little flamewar would have been fun . 
  for fun . 
  everyone loves a pioneer !!, 
  * checks flair * hmmm , doesnt look like anything to me ... 
  this new series `` scumbags of europe '' will never run out.keep em coming . 
  one would think they would prefer steady source and abundancy of food . 
  can we do it as well?or something other than nothing ? 
  well mostly i feel sorry for the tourists that want to see athens ( or greece in general ) at this time of year.at least we can sit in our house all day with air-condition . 
  when you visit another country and you have limited time you want to see all you can.stay hydrated and use sunscreen people.dont put yourselves in danger !, 
  oh ok , fuck you i guess!we had 44 degrees celcius yesterday.why u get to be cool and we roast in hell ? 
  i remember similar photos of greece during [ the big fires of 2007 ] ( https://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/%ce%94%ce%b1%cf%83%ce%b9%ce%ba%ce%ad%cf%82_%cf%80%cf%85%cf%81%ce%ba%ce%b1%ce%b3%ce%b9%ce%ad%cf%82_%cf%83%cf%84%ce%b7%ce%bd_%ce%95%ce%bb%ce%bb%ce%ac%ce%b4%ce%b1_%cf%84%ce%bf_2007#/media/file:greece_2007_fires-nasa.jpg ) . back then the firemen ( volunteers & professionals ) and were the real heroes . 
  nothing more can be said other than have courage and perseverence.it will pass . 
  i was there last summer.it was really beautiful but the fact that you get charged 3 different times ( 1 for inside the church ,1 for going up the belfry and 1 for going up the ramparts for photos ) was really fucking cheap on their part ... 
  give them back or we will send our top politicians to ` fix ' your economy !, 
  i think they are interlinked.solve longstanding problems first then we move forward together !, 
  are you seriously expecting me to do research to understand your reference ? 
  jokes aside perhaps explain in the comments !, 
  ahh the refreshing smell of something other than stagnation and endless taxes !, 
  bunch of schismatics !, 
  ! bring back chalcedonian christianity !!!!, 
  so the last 2 ranks are ` so poor ' and ` broke ' . get on our level noobs . . 
  yeah i know , but by that point there was no `` empire '' . just the shadow of one . 
  eh all the ottomans did was finish a corpse in coma.the real end of the eastern roman empire was in 1204 . damn venetians * shakes fist * !, 
  ah to be this young again !, 
  i know bro . 
  but in some places that sell gyro they also sell doner.thats all i was saying . 
  hey be careful.under aitna lies trapped the titan enceladus ( \u0395\u03b3\u03ba\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 ) . thats what causes the earthquakes !!, 
  ( we still use his name to denote when there is an earthquake . ), 
  we use pork , chicken and lastly lamb to make doner . 
  yeah but his look is a bit evil .
