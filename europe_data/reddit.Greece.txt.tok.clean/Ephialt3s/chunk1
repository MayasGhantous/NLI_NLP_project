wi-fi is leaking from italy . 
   greece not grease i beg to differ ^ ^ ^ ^ flair, 
  no dude , you are wrong , we are clearly doomed . 
  no one is xenophobic though , they are just afraid of the unwashed muslim invaders that will impose sharia law on us and destroy our `` culture '' and other such bullshit . 
  it 's really not , no . 
  every time you hear someone say how much europeans are better/smarter/whatever than americans , have them read this sub . 
  i mean can you we go back to bashing greece ? 
  it was so much better . 
   destabilization of europe europe is not destabilized , you people should perhaps leave your hate filled bubbles every once in a while . 
  he is being sarcastic , while still being more reasonable than most commenters here . 
   national suicide germany already has 16.000.000 immigrants . 
  fuck facts though . 
  it does n't pay denbts, 
  and we suddenly like orban too now , before the refugee crisis he was putin 's man trying to destroy the eu from the inside . 
  no man these people are neither xenophobic nor racist , all they are trying to say is that 100 % of all people living in the middle east are criminals and are going through all this hell to get to europe in order to islamise it . 
  look at germany for example , [ according to this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_germany ) , they have 16.3 million people with `` immigrant background '' . 
  look at the hellhole that is germany today , these dirty welfare shoppers clearly ruined everything . 
  muahahaha , how does it feel ? 
   i miss greek heat . 
  lies . 
  bayern gets pr , refugees get help . 
  win-win , i really do n't see the problem here . 
  or because there are more jobs in germany . 
  [ or you could ask the 700.000 romanian immigrants to germany . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_diaspora ) . 
  do n't call too late though because you may interrupt their german money showers . 
  i am about to have one myself actually . 
   why should we bother with them ? 
  we went to work , not to claim benefits . 
  big difference . 
  yeah , according to made up facts that just came out of your ass . 
   when it 's easy to run you think that abandoning the only place you 've ever known , to travel thousand of miles , for weeks with minimal supplies and food , to have to trust yours and your children 's lives to smugglers is easy ? 
  this is just blind hatred towards desperate people that do desperate things in order to survive and secure a future for their children . 
  and we are supposed to be the civilized ones and they the dirty islamist hordes that want to kill and assimilate everything . 
  shameful . 
  do n't worry , it 's just the `` i 'm not racist but ... '' crowd getting touchy again . 
  calling hundreds of thousands of refugees `` pieces of shit '' based on the actions of a tiny minority = racism calling a murderer a `` piece of shit '' with no regard to his country of origin , skin colour , etc = ** not ** racism ** kk ? 
  thank you . 
  ( nobody tells me what to do ), 
  brown people are everywhere !, 
  no one is responsible for the crime of their ancestors , that is not my point as i said to someone else on the same thread  it is not about colonies , i just gave an ironic reply to the stupid comment a guy made about how `` our ancestors '' will be `` rolling in their graves '', 
   the thread try the entire subreddit, 
  it is not about colonies , i just gave an ironic reply to the stupid comment a guy made about how `` our ancestors '' will be `` rolling in their graves '', 
  never colonized africa right ? 
  the guy that i replied to is dutch . 
  the same ancestors that colonized the countries most of the refugees are fleeing from ? 
  you guys are funny . 
  the fact that you need to remind people that immigrants are not the only `` bad guys '' in europe really shows how ridiculous this sub has become ... 
  do n't forget the ouzo man . 
  how will we pass our time on the beach ? 
   that does n't make greeks europeans . 
  europe is n't even a fucking `` continent '' , it 's just an arbitrary line in the urals that splits the eurasian continent . 
  so , in every possible definition , greece is in europe and greeks are europeans ... sorry to foil your europeans = hitler 's aryans thing you got going in your head . 
   http://i.imgur.com/5sihqze.png oh my god it 's a picture !!!!!, 
  you are so smart i am sorry that i ever spoke up to you mr. aryan , back to my southern ** european ** cave now ... and sun ... and sea ... maybe i will drink some ouzo while i shower myself with germanic money ... who knows ... maybe i will `` forget '' to file my taxes ( deadline is soon ) ... it 's always those little things with us none aryan master race people ... 
   well , you 're not even european so i do n't know why i 'm even trying . 
  there you go , and the absurdity continues . 
  let 's check some quick facts . 
  greece is in southeastern [ europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:europe_orthographic_caucasus_urals_boundary_%28with_borders%29.svg ) . 
  so , geographically i am very much european . 
  greece is a member of the european union and the eurozone . 
  so i am also an eu citizen . 
  very fucking european if you ask me . 
  please let me know if mr. hitler thought eitherwise in his masterpieces . 
  or maybe you can quote some other great scholars like joseph stalin and mao zedong . 
   i take it that you surrender from the debate then . 
  what debate dude ? 
  debates need arguments , what do you expect me to do ? 
   what is relevant is what it says , not where it comes from . 
  is that how it works ? 
  one of history greatest murderers and propagandists wrote it in his book while in prison so it must be true ? 
  not to mention that the bloody thing was written in 1925 . 
  bahahahaha , okok . 
  here 's the guy accusing brussels of `` cultural marxism '' quoting hitler 's propaganda . 
  thanks for wasting my time . 
   `` if beginning today all further aryan influence on japan should stop , assuming that europe and america should perish , japan 's present rise in science and technology might continue for a short time ; but even in a few years the well would dry up , the japanese special character would gain , but the present culture would freeze and sink back into the slumber from which it was awakened seven decades ago by the wave of aryan culture . '', 
  did you just quote mein kampf ? 
   how is this relevant ? 
  what i wrote was that when the whole of europe dies , the rest of the world will stagnate . 
  and i am trying to say that when other cultural centers like rome and greece died the rest of the world did n't stagnate . 
  why would it be any different for the whole of europe ? 
   ancient greece was n't europe and all europeans , nor was rome and the byzantine empire . 
  no but they were our cultural predecessors , when they `` died '' europe carried the torch just fine . 
   wow , i wonder which people invented all of those things . 
  which has nothing to do with the point i am trying to make . 
   no , but they have everything to do with cultural marxist pc indoctrination . 
  brussels is literally stalin yaryaryaryar, 
   lol . 
  europe has created the modern world , and is still and will always be the driving force behind development . 
  if europe and europeans are gone , the rest of the world will soon stagnate . 
  lol . 
  like when ancient greece died and the world stagnated . 
  like when rome/byzantium died and the world stagnated , etc , etc. 
  get over yourself , we are not the ** only ** driving force behind development . 
   which is disgusting . 
  we are 50 countries who have the right to our own cultures being developed in a natural way without directions from brussels . 
  globalization has been happening for a long time , especially in the west . 
  telecommunications , jet engines , industrialization , the internet has been naturally shaping our culture for long time , brussels had nothing to do with that . 
   europe is n't europe if everything european is mixed up . 
  europe is europe if everything european can remain european and be developed naturally in each separate nation state please define what `` europe '' and `` european '' means in your head .
