  does `` europe '' mean irrelevant nation states that wo n't be able to keep up with the rest of the world ? 
  there is no `` european '' culture . 
  that is what the eu is trying to do , create it . 
  and no , when i say eu i do n't mean merkel and sch\u00e4uble , i do n't doubt that they have their own short-sighted goals , ( as all politicians do ) . 
  yeah sure , i can google stuff . 
  you said :  because it 's being run by international finance in order to impose ** cultural marxism ** upon the nation states of europe , so that ** everything european will be eradicated ** . 
  by further european integration everything `` european '' will be eradicated ? 
  how does that even make sense to you ? 
   cultural marxism what ? 
   edit : i 'm sorry , i thought i was contributing to the debate by proposing something else . 
  is / r/europe [ 1 ] refusing contradictory opinions ? 
  meh , i do n't care . 
  this is pretty much every thread about immigration . 
   the homogeny of each country in europe * is n't the european union already threatening that ? 
  can you people please , at leaste , admit that you do n't like brown people ? 
   low quality cultures what the fuck am i reading in this thread ? 
  can you please elaborate ? 
  how do you measure the quality of cultures ? 
   europe 's homogeny what ? 
   or just , you know , a grexit . 
  and if we leave the eurozone there is a 100 % guarantee that you get your money back . 
  that 's how it works ... do people actually believe that we have the money that we owe and are refusing to pay them back ? 
  and it will , once again , be our fault when this program fails and drives our economy deeper into recession . 
  what 's with all the finns jumping in the greece bashing bandwagon lately ? 
  it 's because our flag utilizes blue-white better than yours , is n't it ? 
  i knew it !, 
   spending less than you actually earn  working quite well here in north and baltics seriously ? 
  you have n't had a primary surplus since 2009 http://www.tradingeconomics.com/finland/government-budget http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/12/europe-economy-finland-idusl5n0y35pw20150512, 
  or '' ( o ) theos ( einai ) megalos '' if you want to refer to the christian one . 
   plan for a process that will eventually lead to a solid greek economy which is not something that will happen with any of the proposals ( by both sides ) thus far . 
  it 's preferable to bankruptcy at least . 
  and i live in greece , so ? 
  and i live in greece , so ? 
  i am sorry that i trust actual research and statistics , you know science over a random dude on the internet . 
   the idea that it 's somehow more expensive to live in greece is mostly a myth . 
  instead of basing our opinions on anecdotes let 's do some research . 
  google `` costs of living in the eu '' first result brings us to [ this ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/gmaps_rankings_country.jsp wit ) which ranks countries by `` consumer price index '' or ** cpi ** for short , which according to wikipedia is  a consumer price index ( cpi ) measures changes in the price level of a market basket of consumer goods and services purchased by households . 
  ** greece ** : 58.92 ** romania ** : 36.86 and since a higher number means more expensive living costs , your argument is incorrect still not convinced ? 
  let 's try http://www.globalpropertyguide.com/europe/currency-value which ranks countries by `` price of goods in us$ , which in us would cost $ 1 '' greece : ** $ 1.01 ** romania : ** $ 0.70 ** which , again , proves that the higher costs of living in greece are n't just a myth . 
  sarcasm or no sarcasm , nothing i wrote above is an opinion . 
  congrats dude . 
  personal debt = sovereign debt . 
  fuck those retarded economists that decided to split economic theory into micro-macro economics . 
  you obviously know better . 
  which is pretty much what is happening in greece , the numbers are sketchy at best . 
  also : http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/19/young-talented-greek-generation-g-worlds-biggest-brain-drain, 
   unemployment in romania , bulgaria , poland ( a few years ago ) and other places would be comparably high to your own , if a couple million people did not seek temporary employment elsewhere . 
  [ can you please elaborate further on this argument , while taking this into consideration ? 
  ] ( http://www.google.gr/publicdata/explore?ds=z8o7pt6rd5uqa6_&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;idim=country:ro:pl:sk&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;fdim_y=seasonality:sa&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country:ro:pl:el:bg&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ), 
   they could pay their debts back if they cut their very highly funded public programs , but they refuse to do that it is really amazing how people , after 6 years of doing just that and basically destroying our economy , still use that stupid argument backed by absolutely no facts . 
  here , have some : http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/17/comparative-austerity/  they want germany to foot the bill for their mistake instead of taking on the same austerity measures that germany itself took on a little more than 13 years ago when it reunited east and west and , you know what else really helped germany be the economic powerhouse it now is ? 
  the huge debt-relief ( not restructuring that greece is asking for , a straight haircut ) they got in 1953 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/london_agreement_on_german_external_debts, 
  you should expect to see the same post copy-pasted in 2-3 other similar threads . 
   it 's hard to understand how you 've read the report and come to that conclusion . 
  if you could read the things he regurarly posts in / r/greece you 'd understand . 
  i am not talking about defaults , i am talking about the [ london agreement on external german debt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/london_agreement_on_german_external_debts ) which shaved off a huge part of the german debt that resulted from both world wars . 
  ( i read somewhere that it is/was the biggest debt relief in world history , but i ca n't seem to find a second source ) ps : i am not saying that this agreement was in any way bad or should n't have happened , it was a great deal that ended up benefiting all the parties involved and helped germany become the economic powerhouse it now is . 
  hahahaha , what ? 
  you used your `` get out of jail for free '' card in the 1950s . 
  here 's your villains europe . 
  i said no such thing, 
  99.9 % you are right , but the ecb has yet to make such a decision . 
  panic never helps . 
   atms running out of money is real , not media lies . 
  which is not all that serious and wo n't bankrupt the country . 
  you can start panicking once ecb cuts off greek banks from the ela . 
  no , i am not denying that people are withdrawing money from the banks , but you ca n't really have a `` bank run '' from atms . 
  i am just being sarcastic towards the mainstream greek media that are trying to scare people . 
  i 'll give you 5 $ and a goat for it . 
  i hope they go on a tour after they are done there . 
   milestone in polish entertainment i 'd say a milestone in interactive entertainment in general . 
  and since it is so successful , people are going to create controversies out of nowhere , just to get more attention/ad revenue . 
   not really . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurozone  the eurozone ( about this sound pronunciation ( help \u00b7 info ) ) , officially called the euro area , [ 7 ] is a ** monetary union ** of 19 european union ( eu ) member states that have adopted the euro ( $ ) as their common currency and sole legal tender . 
  constantine xi palaiologos , the last roman emperor from wikipedia  following his death , he became a legendary figure in greek folklore as the `` marble emperor '' who would awaken and recover the empire and constantinople from the ottomans . 
   a legend tells that when the ottomans entered the city , an angel rescued the emperor , turned him into marble and placed him in a cave under the earth near the golden gate , where he waits to be brought to life again to conquer the city back for christians . 
  it 's pretty obvious that they meant nazi-occupied poland since they mention fucking schindler . 
  and if i got mad about every history revisionist on the internet i would n't have time for anything else . 
  and , yet again , people get offended over nothing . 
   we got another thing in common now boys i keep telling people that we a lot more in common than most people think !, 
   some countries and people just do not matter when there are `` higher '' interests involved ( cold war ) geopolitics 101 . 
  this should n't come as a surprise to anyone . 
  you wot mate ? 
  ** check republic ** [ official flag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/yes_check.svg/1024px-yes_check.svg.png ), 
  persians still won that fight . 
  yeah let 's mentions the only fight they actually won !, 
  yeah , reforms ** are ** needed , no argument about that . 
  but does every state in your glorious federal republic make the same amount of money ? 
  pretty sure it does n't . 
  if we are ever going to get a fully united europe , full fiscal tranfers ** have ** too happen ( and they already do in some degree ) . 
  expert on macroeconomics , well put . 
  happy easter you non-orthodox heathens !, 
  no ... how did you ... ? 
  you do n't need to be good at school to know the alphabet . 
  [ the sea ] ( http://as1.wdpromedia.com/media/abd/europe/greece-vacations/santorini-coastline-greece-tours.jpg ), 
  depends on your definition of `` white '' i guess . 
  no , they did n't look like scandinavians . 
  whatever . 
  ancients greeks that colonised the area probably ? 
  are you close to the sea ?
