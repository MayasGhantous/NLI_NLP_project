   socrates  wrongly imprisoned he is living up to his name . 
  wow . 
  i better not reveal what we put in the fruit we export to russia then . 
   greeks are not looking for respect from russia . 
  they are looking for cheap gas to not freeze in the winter . 
  while it may be true that we mostly have mild winters , we also have a shit ton of mountains with their own [ climate ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/climate_of_greece#alpine_mediterranean ) we do need gas , especially in the northern part of the country . 
  i can . 
  i will pick the `` we are so morally superior than you while we are still selling weapons to russia '' crowd . 
  we are exporting agricultural products , so we are clearly the bad guys here . 
   [ link 1 ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/european-countries-are-selling-arms-to-russia-while-condemning-it-over-ukraine/2014/06/16/6ad20143-ffce-4b45-a063-bea132fa0123_story.html )  [ link 2 ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/european-countries-are-selling-arms-to-russia-while-condemning-it-over-ukraine/2014/06/16/6ad20143-ffce-4b45-a063-bea132fa0123_story.html ) we should of course be ashamed because we try to sell fruit to russia . 
  i am very ashamed . 
  it 's plan b , in case we fail to steal all of northern europe 's money . 
  yes please , give us a city that has more population than our whole country . 
  then we get to be a minority in our own country . 
  great idea :p, 
  it 's just a name i use , not opinion related at all . 
  ephialtes was also [ this guy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ephialtes ) . 
   he oversaw reforms that diminished the power of the areopagus , a traditional bastion of conservatism , and which are considered by many modern historians to mark the beginning of the `` radical democracy '' for which athens would become famous ( \u0394\u03b5\u03bd \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c0\u03ac\u03c9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03b1\u03c5\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5 , \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac \u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c7\u03ad\u03c3\u03b7 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf username ), 
  do n't you get it ? 
  he happened to be born in a rich country , so he gets to talk down on everyone else . 
  ( i can the admit that the picture is a bit ridiculous ), 
   1389  1995 do you kill americans on sight ? 
   non sustainable jobs what the above moron is basically saying is that young middle class greeks , such as me , should live in poverty because capitalism in europe is such a wonderful thing . 
  and of course it is your own damn fault form not being born rich . 
  ** putin 's first words **  sorry reddit, 
   should we take varoufakis seriously yes . 
  but why do any actual research on the subject when you can just blame greece ? 
   how should we response to greece ? 
  start by not taking seriously anything that this moron kamenos is saying . 
  sure, 
  look at you getting all poetic and shit . 
  i understand , i was kidding of course . 
  our huge military expenditure is mostly because we border turkey with which we almost went to war with in 1974 and 1996 . 
  corrupt polititians + bribes played a huge role of course . 
  they would if they had the governments we had . 
  where 's your navy poland ? 
  huh ? 
  ( i like how our navy is comparable , in numbers at least , to the uk one . 
  it shows how absurd the previous governments where with spending . ), 
  edit : biggest air force too . 
  jesus christ , ca n't we sell some of them ? 
  i do n't know if you are serious or not , but , it 's true that a lot of people got displaced/massacred from all sides during the last century of the ottoman empire . 
  not a very happy period . 
  137 years ago today bulgaria successfully removed kebab . 
  from the 2nd balkan war and forward bulgaria was n't really good at picking sides . 
  restore the roman empire ? 
  ... huh ... sure !, 
  bring some oil down south , would you ? 
  too north . 
  so , your only interaction with europe is the other half of the internet ? 
  finally , we can focus on the things that matter . 
  `` romania '' was also what the medieval romans aka byzantines called their country/kingdom/empire . 
  you just wait until we are done with the macedonia fiasco romania , we are coming for your asses too . 
  where do we apply for annexation ? 
  colonies ? 
  the nerve !, 
  we are south-eastern , so we have de jure claims on both sets of stereotypes . 
   lazy italians you take that back , we are the lazy ones !, 
  `` gorogorszag '' so , gorog just means greek in hungarian ? 
  does n't mean we ca n't profit from their backwardness / s, 
   but i doubt that many people believe delirious shit like that you probably have n't been visiting this sub long enough then . 
  :( btw your flair says `` dutch-greek '' . 
  did you get double the disappointment in this qualifying round ? 
   ** extreme ** leftist ftfy , as one commenter above pointed out . 
  it 's like words have no meaning anymore . 
  john oliver is an extremist , ca n't stop laughing . 
   coastal areas that are secular you can always rejoin ~ ~ the glorious roman empire ~ ~ greece . 
  no it was n't . 
  i do n't see the relevance of that though . 
  yes . 
  greece is a mess , bit really because of the migrants though . 
   would save far more innocent lives do you know of any nukes that kill only terrorists ? 
  are you implying that there are n't muslim hordes raping and pillaging their way through the swedish countryside as we speak ? 
  no goose step either . 
  completely unrealistic . 
  it is not . 
  it was much more complicated than that . 
  rise of aggressive marxist socialism was the single largest reason for the whole avalanche of the events set in motion . 
  haha , this is getting ridiculous . 
   marxist socialists have killed by far more people than nazis this is not an argument in favor of nationalism , stop spamming it . 
   there are ideological successors of the bloodiest regimes in history sitting in european parliament right now yes , and that includes neo-nazis . 
  ca n't both group be bad ? 
  is your brain incapable of accepting that most basic of facts ? 
   nationalism is irrational , because it did far less bad than the socialism nationalism is responsible for the deadliest war in human history , but we should n't be afraid of nationalism because stalin was worse ? 
  how does that work in your head ? 
  does that excuse the shit nationalists did ? 
  is anyone that is n't a nationalist a marxist socialist ? 
  my point is that nationalists did far from ` just fine ' and i do n't see any arguments against that . 
  and by the way , democracy = / = marxist socialism so by definition the `` left '' in modern european countries has as much in common with stalinists as conservatives have with hitler . 
   nationalists normally do just fine since we are taking about regimes 50 + years ago . 
  the nationalist regimes of germany and italy did great in your opinion ? 
   a tentacularian entity that imposes it 's will even when a referendum say no to them . 
  are you refering to the uk referandum ? 
  if yes , i am pretty sure the eu is eagerly waiting for british leaders to activate article 50 . 
   unsubstantiated comments , clearly poorly researched and bashing those he disagrees thank god the leave camp had none of that . 
  the difference is , john oliver is a comedian . 
  `` not all swedes , only / u/kungvald '', 
  the union of european celtic republics - uecr for short . 
   re-take constantinople based lebanon focusing on the things that truly matter, 
  awwww,
