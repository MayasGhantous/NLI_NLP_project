turkish capoeira ? 
  well it 's the `` assure the stability internally '' part freaks me out . 
  now how the fuck he thinks that the military is not going to suffer more cuts , is up to debate, 
  the greek army , unless greece is under attack can not be involved internally ( unless there 's an earthquake or smth and they provide assistance ) . 
  in the case of a coup , everyone , is required to stop it , even by using force, 
  hmm i do n't think he meant that the soldiers would give tickets to cars , i believe he meant it for suppressing a rebelion ( or causing one ), 
  if you consider it for a minute his plan could not work in any way . 
  on the other hand maybe he wants to completely fuck everything up because he 's crazy . 
  in any cace , a defence minister making such claims is dangerous, 
  to give some context , the pm visited the def.min today , to deny any rumours about further cuts on the military ( even though his proposal suggested 600mil cuts . ), 
  translation , briefly : `` the armed forces assure the stability internally , defending the terriotorial integrity , the stability concerning the foreign alliances of the country . 
  irregardless of the financial situation , the armed forces , and its personnel primarly , the command , the chiefs , are the solid basis of the country . 
  a democartic army that continues to protect the image of the country inside and outside . 
  i thank the pm who assured me that the propositions to the insitutions do not have any cuts to the armed forces . 
  its personnel has lost up to 50 % of its pay and they are at the limit of their capacities '' . 
  most of the military units are based in attica . 
  including special forces and armored units . 
  they need 30mins to get to downtown athens , even if they are asked to do so now . 
  the defmin said ** internally ** . 
  not by outside invaders , not by enemies abroad , internally . 
  the military in greece can not be involved in internal security . 
  that 's the role of the police . 
  that law was created due of the 1967 coup and since then , the military can not take the role of the police . 
  the guy is a idiot , now if he 's preparing for a coup , he 's a dangerous idiot . 
  ps : i know this sounds weird to non-greeks but for us here is a very big deal . 
  having troups policing means one thing, 
  not in greece though . 
  that 's why i 'm freaking out . 
  it 's prohibited for the military to do so , because of fears for a coup . 
  that was the logic behind the legislation, 
  not internally . 
  that 's the role of the police . 
  it 's illegal by law for the army to take the role of the police . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqdi5tt2qnw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=18s in greek though edit : mini translation by me https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3bvc5r/greeces_min_of_nat_defense_just_said_the_military/cspvsbu, 
  the greek military can not take the role of the police . 
  it is illegal , by law , by the consitution . 
  implying that the armed forces will take the role of policing means he 's preparing for a coup, 
  propaganda much ??? 
  \u0397is [ tweet ] ( https://twitter.com/gregoryfarmakis/status/615861452600123392 ) literally few mins later . 
  translation : since i know you are fanaticals , i 've already payed my workers this morning !!, 
   every constitutional lawyer that was asked in greece said that there is no issue with the constitution . 
  ehh no . 
  the lawyers are mixed and some claim that there is a problem with the legality, 
  russian ministers have been releasing weird info on helping greece . 
  they go from `` no assistance was requested '' to `` we are ready to fund greece '' to `` no plans have been made for greece '' . 
  clearly this position suits them . 
  what i meant on the extreme part , was that receiving a bailout one day and basically shitting on the rest of europe the next day is a bit extreme . 
  it does n't have to be that way ofc, 
  sure , they could use it to the benefit of the people , i 'm just talking about the worst case scenario here, 
  not to mention that syriza deputees and a syriza minister are among the one waiting in line ( greek source http://www.protothema.gr/politics/article/488285/oures-sta-atm-tis-voulis-molis-ta-xanagemisan/ ), 
  news report that super-markets are emptying . 
  i went this morning and it was busier than usual but nothing crazy . 
  people are protesting by withdrawing cash from atm 's, 
  i gave an extreme example , nothing more, 
  imagine this : greece is bailed out on monday . 
  on tuesday , tsipras announces a 100 % increase in salaries / pensions , an arms deal with russia and a massive development plan . 
  he can do it since we 're debt free . 
  meanwhile the average european will be thinking that he got scammed . 
  i that 's the practical problem you have , when you 're trying to bail out a country without imposing some sort of agreement . 
  land and housing is worthless when there 's no money left, 
   it 's going to beautiful . 
  unless you live in greece,

  haha deep down , i knew you would understand the importance of the french language !, 
  ( lived in brussels for a while , loved to pick on dutch-speaking belgians ;-) ), 
   but is there really anyone here that thinks ` oh finally , a comment in french !, 
  i really need to practice french more and a few more comments in french , make it easier for me to do so, 
   whatever deal will be reached ( if any ) will have to be ratified by the parliaments of several countries , on both sides . 
  in greece it wo n't go through the parliament , there 's no time for that , it will pass as a law with the signatures of the pm and finmin . 
  as for other countries , only germany and finland ( maybe wrong here ) will have to take it to the parliament, 
  nah bulgarians are bros, 
  i do n't believe politicians, 
  just like he intended to abandon the memorandum and not talk to the `` architect of austerity '' madam merkel ? 
  yeah my bad . 
  to further elaborate , i believe syriza deputees such as michelogianakis etc will not vote , but the leftists like lafazanis will . 
  they did vote in favour of the conservative president after all . 
  i do n't think they 're so stupid to cause elections , if they do that , it will be the end of their political careers ( and their lovely salaries ) edit : same with anel , they like being in the gvt , they wo n't take any risks to lose their position . 
  they will vote it and sell it as a success, 
  n.pappas is all talk but no actions . 
  he apparently does n't see a problem with the increased taxes and vat increase that syriza proposed or the fact that he 's cooperating with a ( far ) right wing populist . 
  he 's just talking , to ease his voters, 
  well i completely disagree with your approach . 
  the new agreement will pass , some members will not vote but the majority will . 
  why ? 
  because they 're populists who do n't want to abandon their lovely seats . 
  they will accuse the eu for anything but in the end they will simply agree . 
  just as they agreed on cooperating with the far-right idiots of anel , just like they did n't criticize the 500mil military deal , just like they did n't adopt any cuts to their 6.000 euros a month salary and so on . 
   what will happen if the vote goes through with the help of the opposition ? 
  if members of the coalition do n't vote and the program gets adopted with the help of the opposition , then syriza will have lost the majority of seats on the parliament . 
  then tsipras might have to ask the parliament for a vote of confidence . 
   would they dare to call for a new election ? 
  it 's pretty complicated . 
  they can not even call for election until a year passes from the last election . 
  if tsipras resigns , the other opposition leaders will have to ask for a vote of confidence and if all of them fail , then elections take place, 
  roumeliotis himself ( the source ) ** took back ** the fucking statement ... jesus zerohedge is rt of the left, 
  that would deserve a gold, 
  the turkish stream . 
  i do n't think that 's a secret, 
  i think the eu permanent representations ( ambassador level ) already agreed on an extension of the current sanctions ( that was yesterday ) . 
  there 's a foreign affairs council on monday on the same issue .
