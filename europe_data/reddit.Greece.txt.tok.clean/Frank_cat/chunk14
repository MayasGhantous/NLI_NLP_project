  and one way or another we will . 
  i would suggest though - if i may - to start seeing the amount of manipulation mr schaeuble and media have done . 
  not for our sake , that 's not something you should care about , but for your sake . 
  you might be surprised in the coming months or years . 
  the same to you too !, 
  it seems it did n't . 
  have n't you heard the news ? 
  but even if it did , it was n't out of solidarity or anything . 
  just a side effect . 
  i do n't suppose you see that it was supposed to be an effort with the help of our friends . 
  in any case we will deal with it rest assured . 
  there are many things we must think really hard . 
  but i would say that this goes for all parties . 
  well you forgot that part : `` at the same time , ** a grexit would be traumatic enough that it would help scare the rest of europe ** into giving up more sovereignty to a stronger banking and fiscal union , '' scary tactics is what will drive europe forward . 
  are you ok with it too ? 
  so in other words it was n't help , solidarity and all that crap . 
  great !, 
  and how about this : http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/30/business/dealbook/the-hard-line-on-greece.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=1, 
  how ? 
  well the narrative here is that many proposals for reforms were not allowed by the troika . 
  the only reforms we could make is what was on the agreements , anything else would be a unilateral action . 
  have considered the possibility that greece is used all these years for other reasons ? 
  that solving the problem was not really the target ? 
  polite ... you fail to see the symmetry on that but it doesnt matter . 
  croatia is wonderful to have vacations there . 
  = bulgarian . 
  yeah , i do realize that and personally i think it 's the latter . 
  i was wondering if the german public see it too . 
  but if he knows it doesnt work , then he knows it leads to bankruptcy . 
  in any case i was referring to his manipulation of the german public . 
  how can he tell them this now and all these years used their money for a sure ( according to his view ) failure . 
  does n't the german public find it an oxymoron ? 
  but doesnt that make him a liar to the german public ? 
  i mean if all these years he knew that the bail outs would n't work with out a debt cut ( which he thinks impossible ) then why did he push for them ? 
  why did he accept them and waste german people 's money on them . 
  he doesnt agree to a debt cut even though he acknowledges that without it any bail out program is doomed . 
  merkel seems to agree . 
  so why are there negotiations ? 
  why the `` deadlines '' ? 
  why all this charade ? 
  you think it is funny ? 
  you feel safe ? 
  hahahaha the joke 's on you !, 
  we will unleash this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zof93ovta-u you are doomed !, 
  who knows where he comes from . 
  huh ? 
  they way things are going , pretty soon will be the absolute champions . 
  public spending will go to 0 !, 
  it was a damn great speech !, 
  well done and thank you mr verhofstadt !, 
  she 's a certified one !, 
  here she 's telling lady gaga that the end is near and that she should get out of greece . 
  by the way ... 
  if you dont like that gift , pandora has a surprise box for you !, 
  not very , but i know 2 guys with that name . 
  nope i am not '' . good at insulting people '' . 
  only those that do n't miss a chance to spread venom through lies . 
  i just despise hate mongers as yourself . 
  so in the end they lied to all of us . 
  to me when they imposed austerity and told me that this would make my economy better ( when they knew it would only make things worse ) to you when they told you , you were helping those nasty & lazy greeks . 
  when in fact they used your money to save private banks and not greece . 
  hint : being in europe doesnt make them creditors . 
  both of them are not members of the ez and have not contributed to the bailouts . 
  except for a liar , you are a complete moron are n't you ? 
  nah ecb did n't brake its own rules only for greece . 
  far from it ... look at that ( it doesnt has to do with greece ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu5styaxyao this has to do with greece : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwud0mqu3qk both are very revealing documentaries . 
  they are german two . 
  you should watch them 1st chance you 'll have . 
  fair enough !, 
  here are a few pointers : http://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article143576563/athens-nein-ist-auch-eine-niederlage-fuer-merkel.html http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11654639/imf-has-betrayed-its-mission-in-greece-captive-to-emu-creditors.html http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/02/imf-greece-needs-extra-50bn-euros?cmp=share_androidapp_copy_to_clipboard http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/30/greek-debt-troika-analysis-says-significant-concessions-still-needed http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/03/us-eurozone-greece-imf-iduskcn0pd20120150703 unfortunately atm i do n't have the time . 
  later on i will give you more on this . 
  so the facts are : you and i were lied that the former troika programs would solve the crisis even if they were followed to the t. also the options are two : - for greece to default ( nothing is needed to be done for this , no need for fake programs ) - for greece to not default : a program and a debt restructuring . 
  here are two very revealing documentaries : - one for portugal , spain and ireland https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu5styaxyao - one for greece , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwud0mqu3qk, 
  as i said the ecb is far from being transparent . 
  you can search it yourself and you 'll be surprized . 
  when it is not transparent then it 's easy to assume it is not neutral too . 
  in fact there are many things that point otherwise . 
   i do , i thought your english to be better and i thought you 'd read my comment correctly . 
  i said you pointed to the existence of a third way , not the third way itself . 
   yes and the mathematics do not point to the existence of a third way , whilst you and syriza keep insisting there is . 
  now you 're playing with words . 
  there is a third way . 
  it 's the one mathematics prove viable . 
  that it is not on the table yet is irrelevant . 
  the mathematical solutution exists even if it will never be applied . 
  so yes others with great knowledge found it and i can point to it . 
  my english might suck but i think you are wrong here . 
   [ citation needed ] oh c'mon ... it 's everywhere !, 
  almost on every report about the crisis . 
  even die welt had an article about it today . 
  google is your friend . 
  i am no syriza supporter myself . 
  i have to give it to them though . 
  before varoufakis no one even pointed it out . 
  everyone pretended it was otherwise . 
  the imf formaly acknowledged it . 
  personaly i cant control anything about the matter and it is certain that i 'll have to live with whatever decisions others will make . 
  it 's always good to know where these decisions will lead us and dont take their word on it . 
  the problem my friend is not the czech banks . 
  i have no doubt that the czech banks are very responsible .
