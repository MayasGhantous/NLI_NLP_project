  badly . 
  unfortunately it looks like syriza is opting for the worst outcome . 
  thank you for your wishes . 
  much appreciated . 
  some coalition gov of national unity . 
  yes you do ( pass judgment ) . 
  it is rather odd that you do n't realize it . 
  `` collective responsibility '' you said ? 
  gosh !, 
  the trick is exactly there : he informed the public very well on how bad things will be if we vote yes . 
  he never informed the public on how bad thing will be if we vote no . 
  germans are not responsible for anything . 
  the problem though is that one cliche was happily replaced with another one : greeks are responsible for everything . 
  you do n't know how much `` easy '' hate and resentment we get all this time . 
  how many facts are being twisted for it . 
  no it is just a trick . 
  he says the proposals are far from his pre election promises thus he wants to know what the people want . 
  as far as i know all those months , all the proposals were far from his promises . 
  he knew . 
  now that has no more time he wants out . 
  well the call for that referendum is a new low in gr politics . 
  they lost any political future . 
  also many are under judicial investigation , some already behind bars . 
  that will happen if greece leaves the eu . 
  only then we will have to pay . 
  anyway , hoping for a good outcome on sunday . 
  i too hope for a resounding yes . 
  for many reasons one of them to get rid of tsipras . 
  also worry not , in any case ( grexit & default or not ) tax payers there wo n't pay a thing . 
  `` irresponsible '' banks were saved not by true money but by bonds that will never be called to be liquified . 
  as much as i do n't like syriza and their tactics they do have a point or two . 
  watch this if you want : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex20y_p3qv8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=34m00s, 
  most greeks do not hate germany . 
  also that cliche for free money is wrong but anyway it doesnt matter . 
  hard core syriza fans hate greece too , the rest of their followers are simply dumb . 
  ahem ... never mind !, 
  well your family certainly knows how to judge people . 
  carry on . 
  he is exactly that !, 
  i do n't like him at all . 
  low quality , manipulative a lier at best . 
  extremely populist and as the referendum shows he ca n't take the responsibility of his failure . 
  the referendum is a terrible farse that syriza plays on the people . 
  the ballot is a disgrace too . 
  oh we very well realize what the problems are in our society . 
  we very well realize how big of a weight corruption is . 
  what we do n't accept though is the magnitude of the matters that so lightly many turn against us . 
  as for that marginal improvement , sadly it is not enough but then again as we speak your own country is only marginally better and not about everything too . 
  at least no greek will give you a lesson in morality ( although there are many reasons that can be found ) . 
   ez and eu for economic and european political purposes . 
  those indeed are the `` geo-political strategic considerations '' you mentioned . 
  as for the rest , that is your opinion and i have no saying in that . 
  perhaps the south/the pigs should never joined/allowed in the eu . 
  if that was better or not for the ** `` exclusive club with high expectations and qualifications to which aspirational members strive to live up to '' ** is something that needs a lot of analysis to be proven . 
  perhaps the north without the '' military and geo-political strategic '' back of the south would n't be as successful . 
  it is most simplistic than you think . 
  from the greece was/is the most corrupt https://www.transparency.org/cpi2014/results to the greece was in terrible mess : http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/29/the-awesome-gratuitousness-of-the-greek-crisis/?module=blogpost-title&amp;version=blog%20main&amp;contentcollection=opinion&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=blogs&amp;region=body&amp;_r=0 everything was blown out of proportion and made much worse than it really was . 
  also if you ignore `` any kind of military and geo-political strategic considerations '' there is absolutely zero reason for everyone to be in the ez or the eu . 
  people are always eager to make easy conclusions based on simplistic views . 
  unfortunately reality never is or works that way . 
  it 's better for yourself not to make that mistake . 
  be careful please . 
  hotel safes are not very safe . 
  also you should know that foreign card holders have no limit on the amount of cash they can take from atms . 
  in any case please be careful . 
  you will have a great time there . 
  every single day there are voices that point to the many myths about this crisis . 
  in vain . 
  people like their cliches . 
  here 's another one : http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/29/the-awesome-gratuitousness-of-the-greek-crisis/?module=blogpost-title&amp;version=blog%20main&amp;contentcollection=opinion&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=blogs&amp;region=body&amp;_r=0, 
  nope i feel let down by everyone . 
  mostly by people who think it is so easy to pass judgment and climb on their high horse . 
  a pointer : http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/29/the-awesome-gratuitousness-of-the-greek-crisis/?module=blogpost-title&amp;version=blog%20main&amp;contentcollection=opinion&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=blogs&amp;region=body&amp;_r=0, 
  oh gawd you miss the point . 
  i am not interested on arguing . 
  i am giving you facts : portugal 's and greece 's economies are not that easily comparable . 
  and yes military spending is huge here and non existing there in comparison . 
  wan na see it ? 
  fine . 
  you do n't ? 
  fine again . 
  i am not an analyst to have my own data . 
  this however was stated in many articles around the globe . 
  the need for further cuts of 8 billion euros from the real economy has that effect . 
  comparisons are helpful when 2 similar cases are compared . 
  if not then everything one may assumes is just false . 
  the portuguese and greek economies are not similar . 
  nor are the situations and background about these economies . 
  for instance what is the need in portugal for military expenses . 
  military expenses in greece are huge but most of it necessary . 
   in fact , it is much worse than that . 
  greece is the most corrupt country in the eu . 
  talking about facts that show greece is the most corrupt country in the eu : https://www.transparency.org/cpi2014/results seriously , to check the facts you better take your head out of your arse !, 
  idiot . 
  sounds like a solid plan mate !, 
  i 'll pretend i 've never said it too !, 
  you are forgetting that euro = eurozone not eu . 
  also there are many potential business partners around . 
  do n't think that euro is where the world ends . 
  edit : what is most useful to putin , than anything else is our strategic position .
