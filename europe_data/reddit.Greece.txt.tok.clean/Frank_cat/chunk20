  it is nice to be snide but even better to be properly informed . 
  you can check it out yourself why a privately owned debt became a public owned one . 
  google is your friend you can use it if you want it . 
  `` leaked minutes of imf meetings in 2010 show that argentina , brazil , india , russia and switzerland all argued that some greek debt owed to private banks should be cancelled before any bailout from the institution . 
  in documents released by the wall street journal , ** these countries and others argued that imf loans would actually bail out private european banks , leaving greece in debt and an even worse economic situation . 
  this is exactly what has happened ; ** greece 's economy is now in its sixth year of recession , the government 's foreign debt has increased to 180 per cent of gdp and one-in-ten of the population now live in extreme poverty . '', 
  http://jubileedebt.org.uk/blog/leaked-imf-documents-show-global-opposition-lenders-bank-bailout so i 'm terribly sorry that this is n't my fault !, 
  blind hate is not justified for any reason whatsoever and has nothing to do with someone 's government but rather on another one 's own narrow mind . 
  i know what happened to latvia in the 90s etc. 
  what has that got to do with anything but petty feelings ? 
  latvia 's or romania 's cases have nothing to do with greece 's . 
  you were part of the soviet pack , we were n't . 
  in fact we did have a war , a bloody civil war straight after the wwii , exactly because we did n't want to be part of the eastern bloc . 
  as for `` cowardice '' and the rest you mention like `` y' all wanted to live like in the west without having the engine for it '' , it is obvious that you know and understand nothing on the situation . 
  nothing whatsoever . 
  so i wo n't even try . 
  i will only give you a hint : in the west where now you are new members , nothing is as clear cut as was in the soviet times . 
  it is never `` this or that '' . 
  it will take time but eventually you 'll come to realize it . 
  thanks too for the wishes . 
  thank you very much !, 
  it is like this though ? 
  was greece really given a choice ? 
  have n't you heard that even the imf acknowledged their mistake ? 
  have n't you heard how many members in the imf ( brazil was one ) at the start of the bail outs , protested and they stated that `` the program is to save private banks on expense of greece '' ? 
  and what tax payers money are you talking about ? 
  that was n't greece 's fault . 
  greece owned to private banks . 
  also about the tax payers money ... 
  the bailout is just eurobonds printed money not peoples actual money . 
  just debt, 
  thank you for your good spirit . 
  you see what we are facing , something much worse than the economic hardship : blind hate . 
   / r/doctomoe : good . 
  let 's close the borders to greece and offer their seat to turkey . 
  oh god that again . 
  no one on the planet will ever pay their debts !, 
  no one !, 
  they are `` servicing '' their debts by rolling them . 
  aka taking new loans to pay the old ones . 
  greece 's rolling of its debt was interrupted by the american crisis . 
  that it all to it . 
  again !, 
  out of proportion and hardly the reason of the current mess . 
  see how many other countries did the same and are now in deep mess . 
  hardly because of that though . 
  you are right that calling for a referendum atm is wrong . 
  it is not moronic though . 
  look at it this way : syriza sold the narrative that they will end austerity cause they are right and they can make the others ( troika ) to see things their way . 
  unfortunately enough people ( for many reasons ) bought the fairy tale . 
  now syriza fucked up to gigantic proportions . 
  how can they save face and not look like the complete idiots they are ? 
  play the democracy thing . 
  in reality they throw the hot potato to citizens hands . 
  i am not saying that many things they asked troika all these months were n't right . 
  they were . 
  even the last proposal was in fact just kicking the can down the road and not a true solution to the problem . 
  but this referendum is their way out ... of the blame . 
  i sincerely hope they wo n't . 
  not in the next few days but anytime soon . 
  alas check how many countries at the moment have a greater debt as a percentage of the gdp , than greece had when the storm started . 
  what a short sighted interpretation of reality using an overblown fact !, 
  `` the requirement that the 1999 budget deficit should have been ** below 3 % of gdp ** was one of the key criteria for eurozone entry ; thus , its revision to 3.1 % , ** the precise figure was actually 3.07 % , ** according to eurostat ( ameco ) , led to a controversy about greece 's admission . 
  in the 2005 oecd report for greece ( p. 47 ) it was clearly stated that `` the impact of new accounting rules on the fiscal figures for the years 1997 to 1999 ranged from 0.7 to 1 percentage point of gdp ; this retroactive change of methodology was responsible for the revised deficit exceeding 3 % in 1999 , the year of emu membership qualification '' . 
  the above has led the greek minister of finance to clarify that the 1999 budget deficit was below the prescribed 3 % limit when calculated with the esa79 methodology in force at the time of greece 's application , and thus , since the remaining criteria had also been met , was properly accepted into the eurozone . 
  esa79 was also the methodology employed to calculate the deficits of all other eurozone members at the time of their applications . '', 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_financial_audit,_2004 so the original sin in this case was ** 0.7 % ** of the gdp !, 
  do you know how many countries done that , even to a greater degree ? 
  pah !, 
  some people are so willing to keep repeating the shit they heard on tv and pass judgment without even knowing what they are talking about . 
  that is so sad ... 
  exactly . 
  i do n't think any polls exist yet . 
  i do hope for a resounding yes for many reasons . 
  getting rid of tsipras & co too . 
  oh what a hypocritical sob . 
  as if the proposal that 's been put on the table by the troika was n't a death sentence postponed . 
  seriously ... tsipras & co + troika : fuck off !, 
  do you think that by emptying the atms during the weekend the public will calm down by monday and the bankrun wo n't happen at all ? 
  is n't what 's happening atm ( no pun intended ) a good indicator then ? 
  exactly !!!!, 
  do you wish to be continuously whipped ? 
  yes or no ? 
  - yes . 
  * \\* whip * / * - no . 
  * \\* whip * / * ( no one told you that if you say `` no '' the whipping stops ), 
  my feelings exactly ... 
  i feel let down both from my government ( s ) and by the eu . 
  everyone 's done a shitty job . 
  what to vote next sunday ? 
  - yes ? 
  how ? 
  the proposal on the table was only kicking the can down the road ... 
  i would be like a contemned waiting for his execution date to be postponed . 
  and what will this bring that it wo n't be worse than before ? 
  do they want my blessings to destroy me for good ? 
  the funny part is that everyone ( troika and tsipras ) must be feeling good for their part in this story ... at first i thought to draw a cock , but perhaps 4 cunts ( troika & our pm ) is better suited ... 
  thank you sir !, 
  it 's only in demonstrations we lose our cool . 
  `` my city '' it must be in your dreams then .
