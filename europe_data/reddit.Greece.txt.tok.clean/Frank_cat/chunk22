  also the hypocrisy is so great one has to be blindfolded to start ignoring it . 
  why not a pan european tax system ? 
  well the answer is easy . 
  how many tax paradises are there in the eu ? 
  luxemburg is not the only . 
  how many legitimate businesses are offering ways to tax evade ? 
  netherlands has many . 
  how about corporate taxes . 
  see ireland . 
  and how people talk about the irish success in contrast to the greek failure . 
  all and all , not only trust is lacking , but what 's worse the will to fix anything at all is what 's lacking . 
  yes i despair, 
  oh brother , why do you even try to state what is obvious . 
  what they want is for our countries to save the poor immigrants and then keep them . 
  anything other than that shows how absurd we southerners are ... :(, 
  of course you have the right to an opinion . 
  dont expect it to be valid though and dont get annoyed if proven it isnt . 
  you know the saying , dont you ? 
  ` opinions are like assholes , everyone has one but they think each others stink . ', 
   maybe i have wrong information here , but at the beginning of the negotiations , was n't the stance of the greek side nobody looks into our books , even asking is a breach of sovereignity ? 
  furthermore , are the numbers in the books complete ? 
  how far into depth do you think the institutions really could check the books ? 
  you do have the wrong information my friend . 
  let me give you some hints . 
  you talk - and very rightfully - about the book cooking . 
  this certainly is a fact . 
  but what exactly was that cooking ? 
  what was the magnitude of it ? 
  do you know exactly what happened so to call it upon trust ? 
  here it is : `` * the requirement that the 1999 budget deficit should have been below 3 % of gdp was one of the key criteria for eurozone entry ; thus , its revision to 3.1 % , the precise figure was actually 3.07 % , according to eurostat ( ameco ) , led to a controversy about greece 's admission . 
  in the 2005 oecd report for greece ( p. 47 ) it was clearly stated that `` the impact of new accounting rules on the fiscal figures for the years 1997 to 1999 ranged from 0.7 to 1 percentage point of gdp ; this retroactive change of methodology was responsible for the revised deficit exceeding 3 % in 1999 , the year of emu membership qualification '' . 
  the above has led the greek minister of finance to clarify that the 1999 budget deficit was below the prescribed 3 % limit when calculated with the esa79 methodology in force at the time of greece 's application , and thus , since the remaining criteria had also been met , was properly accepted into the eurozone . 
  esa79 was also the methodology employed to calculate the deficits of all other eurozone members at the time of their applications . 
  * '' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_financial_audit,_2004 so what you say that broke the trust is the fact that 3.07 % budget deficit was shown as 3.0 % . 
  that is what we are talking about . 
  so although the cooking was real it is also real that it was blown out of proportion . 
  what is not real , is that the rest of the ez members didnt know about it . 
  other countries did the same , italy did it even more yet never gets mentioned . 
  what trust are we talking about then ? 
  what i see is selectively finding an occasion to make a point . 
  the choices are two : - a ) to not default - b ) to default when a greek wants a ) some will come and ask : `` why the hell should i care and help you to not default when a greek wants b ) some will come and say : so you dont want to pay the debt . 
  btw defaulting does not mean that the debt goes away . 
  sympathy or not this is the reality . 
  also the reality is that you personally again and again make vitriol comments about greeks in general , expressing your agony if the `` tax payers money will be paid back '' while you are a romanian and therefore gave exactly zero ( 0 ) euros . 
  so why do you have so much agony about other people 's money ? 
  again , you miss the point completely cause you are more interesting on the agruing itself than the whole picture . 
  i am not a communist , not a communist sympathizer . 
  far from it . 
  in the video you 've seen some points were made . 
  were they valid or not ? 
  that 's what you should care and chat and not if they were made by a communist . 
  there are plenty of pro capitalist economists who say exactly the same . 
  even more on that matter . 
  see the story and not the tags . 
  so your assumption is dead wrong . 
  also i havent asked for anyone to pay for me . 
  where the hell did you see me asking something like that ? 
  are you having visions ? 
  do you hear voices too ? 
  i do agree that our governments ( as all governments in the west , check it out yourself ) failed miserably and ** we should default ** . 
  i am all for default since the start of this charade . 
  but you that say such cliches , did you not see that ** we werent allowed ** to default ? 
  forgot that when the then prime minister asked for a referendum on if we accept the 1st bail out or default he was overthrown and replaced by a government with out elections ? 
  what is it then ? 
  short or selective memory you have ? 
  nope the video is not generalizations . 
  it 's spot on . 
  as for syriza ? 
  i dont five a flying fuck for them and am not one of their voters . 
  the funny part though is that those `` extremist communisms '' are in fact asking what every single pro capitalist economist on the globe says it should be done . 
  even nobel prize winners . 
  so no , its not about abandoning their promises to the people . 
  that , they have done a long time ago , the very minute the continued the negotiations the former government started . 
  as for the rest i think you should dig to the facts a little bit more . 
  the public sector here is bellow the eu average . 
  as for the number of pensioners and their cost , again you should dig deeper . 
  you 'll find that this is a myth too . 
  yeah greece has a huge debt . 
  180 % of the gdp after the troika treatment . 
  it was 116 % before that . 
  way lower than what portugal or italy nowadays have . 
  agreeing to what the troika asks now , it will take it to 200 % !, 
  way to solve the problem wouldnt you say ? 
  my solution would be to stop calling that shit solidarity and stop this farse . 
   if greece gets away with it , there 's no reason why everyone else in the eu would n't . 
  do you know what this phrase really means ?? 
  that portugal , italy or whoever find himself in trouble they will be treated the same way . 
  fuck greece , but saying something like that to italians , portuguese , spaniards etc means anything other than the eu project is dead on water ? 
  seriously think about it . 
  as for that :  can you give me a reason why i should care for the incompetence of greek politicians ? 
  the answer is simple : you shouldnt give a shit about them or the greek people . 
  but then again you should answer me why should i or an italian give a shit if estonia gets eaten by the russian bear . 
  i do understand that tuckling the issue the way it should be , it would be political suicide in some countries . 
  unfortunately this is true and is because they are caught up in their own narrative . 
  years of low level political nonsense ( greeks are lazy and this and that ) . 
  now they 'd have to contradict their own narrative . 
  and as for trust ? 
  please !, 
  we are not talking about inter-person relationships here . 
  no trust is needed when you do have to tools to check the other one every moment you wish .
