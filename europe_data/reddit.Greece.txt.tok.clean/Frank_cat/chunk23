  but even on trust level , those who claim it is about it wouldnt have any moral ground to point fingers as that trust they talk about ? 
  they abused it royally many times themselves . 
  no my friend the game is not about naivity . 
  it 's about who has the power ( in a supposedly union of equals ) , what messages wants to send to 3rd parties etc etc. 
  i do agree that what 's happening is farsical to a ridiculous degree but if they think that the future historian will be blind and wont see who started the disintegration . 
  the greek budget is still showing a surplus . 
  a surplus on itself isnt much of a success . 
  it depends how it was obtained . 
  in this case it was with severe public spending ( ie hospitals cant provide basic cures now ) and severe taxation ( incomes dropped by 40 % and taxes went up by 270 % in 7 years ) . 
  do you think economy recovery will be helped by upping the vat for instance ? 
  since you take it to the 70s ( which is right ) , you should gave the complete picture . 
  so take a look at this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_whzxhrs3f4 starts around 7:00 you 'll undestrand this graph too : ** western world ** post-70s being sustained by debt . 
  this graph of us debt shows it perfectly . 
  http://cdn.factcheck.org/uploadedfiles/2012/04/federal_debt.png go ahead and watch it . 
  you 'll understand why your country ( i dont know which but it doesnt matter anyway ) started to screw things in the 70s too . 
  you 'll understand the global debt too ( that is many times higher than the global gdp ) . 
  lol the article 's title is a valid observation for an economic pov . 
  many others - worldwide - expressed exactly the same thing . 
  so yeah , lets call that a `` blame game '' and go back chatting on how greece screwed things 7 years ago , and how much all this suffering is understandable for the `` poor '' yet `` lazyfuck corrupted '' greeks . 
  hey good neighbors you are free to use ours , if you think it sounds better : `` grexit '' !, 
  for what its worth ( no pun intended ) : want it or not it 's happening . 
  so the answer it to tell italians keep saving them , support them while everyone else keeps on with his business cause it 's `` someone else 's problem '' . 
  yeah it 's not worth it . 
  hypocrisy reigns supreme . 
  you do n't seem to be able to get past the blame game . 
  the situation is rather easy to grasp : - greece fucked up royally with the loans it got - troika comes to the rescue implementing it 's medicine - the medicine is `` somewhat '' toxic and destroys the economy even more . 
  even the imf acknowledged that . 
  - more of the same medicine - only is higher doses than before - is being negotiating . 
  no agreement was reached because the `` sick '' party is afraid that the medicine will wipe out its disease but killing the patient . 
  - matt o ' brien 's article points out just that ( medicine et all ) . 
  the money are created by the one that provides the credit . 
  simple as that . 
  the whole point of this debate in the house of commons was exactly the fact the money are being created by private institutions that have no such eligibility . 
  how are being created ? 
  by giving loans . 
  when they give loans do they have that amount of money in first place ? 
  in fact there are cases that banks gave loans that are 10 times higher than what they own . 
  got it ? 
  ahem . 
  wan na think it over again ? 
  please do . 
  you will also find this very interesting . 
  on thursday 20th november 2014 , for the first time in 170 years , uk parliament has debated the creation of money . 
  few people know that ** 97 % ** of our money supply is created not by the government ( or the central bank ) , but by commercial banks in the form of loans . 
  watch this to understand why ** it will be ** your crisis tomorrow . 
  start at 7:00 . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_whzxhrs3f4, 
   that is a nice , succinct way of putting it . 
  greece 's debt is unsusustainable at present and the only question is when and how it will default . 
  i think it was unsustainable from the start . 
  all that 's happened so far was kicking the can down the road . 
  now it all falls into place !, 
  finally everything is explained !, 
  btw how old are you and why are you up so late ? 
   separating gouvernment from nation is not an argument that flies ... anywhere besides dictatorships . . 
  this is so wrong on so many levels ... 
  it doesnt matter though . 
  not the least . 
  edit : i couldnt care less for the downvoting but i have to inform the idiot that 's done it about his complete stupidity regarding that statement :  separating gouvernment from nation is not an argument that flies ... anywhere besides dictatorships . . that 's how the terrosists arseholes that bombed london metro think as well . 
  britain is a democracy --  britons are responsible for the acts of their government --  civilians doing their everyday business are legitimate targets . 
  blanket statements like this are always dumb . 
  they did n't say only that . 
  they also said that too much of austerity during a crisis wo n't have any good outcome . 
  so far our economy shrunk by 25 % ( by other calculations some say 30 % ) . 
  with this new imf proposal ( if accepted ) an additional 11 % is likely . 
  lol hold your horses buddy . 
  he got 36 % of the vote that means he did n't got the rest . 
  also if this is happening for a regime change in greece then it simply is unacceptable . 
  then eu is simply a bureaucratic dictatorship . 
  if this is the case i should stand behind him even if i do n't like him . 
  the brits seems to got it right with the eu and want out ... 
  how awful that would be it that it the truth ... 
  if tsipras is their target then fine ... but it 's a fucking nation there too . 
  how cynical for the eu ... 
  the fact that there are exaggerations even stupidities is true . 
  but to hand pick the `` caviar '' to make a case for altering the vat in such a range of products is ... a stretching to say the list . 
  how may abnormalities like the `` caviar '' were there ? 
  we are talking about thousands of products . 
  i agree that taxing the companies reduces economic growth but such is the effect of every tax . 
  vat included . 
  also upping the vat is hardly the only tax implemented by the troika so far . 
  everything that the imf asked reduced economic growth . 
  they even accepted that themselves . 
  it looks strange that the imf only now remembers that . 
  all and all i will tell you what i feel . 
  i am not a tsipras voter , i do n't trust him governing my country for many reasons . 
  i felt relieved that he agreed to that last proposal . 
  at first everyone said is was a good basis . 
  suddenly it is unacceptable . 
  i do n't trust anyone now . 
  not tsipras , not the imf , not the eu . 
  i despair . 
  no mate i did n't make it sound anything other than what i wrote . 
  perhaps it was my flair that made you think so . 
  anyway , as far as i see it germany had the bad luck to be occupied by both superpowers . 
  so both of them wanted them on its side of the fence . 
  if it was occupied by one , then it certainly would n't be in the eye of the storm , ground zero you name it . 
  it was no matter of any agreement . 
  sorry but herr sch\u00e4uble is not someone i would ever trust . 
  merkel mmm perhaps but sch\u00e4uble ?? 
  no chance in hell .
