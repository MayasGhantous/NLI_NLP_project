  if i was given the chance i 'd probably trust the anglo-saxon economists . 
  but vat is also taxes . 
  and the imf seems to love raising vat . 
  bollocks !, 
  germany was in they eye of the storm cause there was where the 2 opposing powers met . 
  they just stopped the actual war there and started the cold war . 
  it was the only country/nation in the region occupied from both rival powers . 
  as in asia the only nation that is still divided is korea . 
  when that happens you are in the eye of the storm . 
  no deal is needed . 
  korea is still in the eye of the storm . 
  and keep the snide remarks to yourself . 
  then why all this charade ? 
  you must know the answer , you seem to have a strong opinion . 
  yet many make the comparisons ... `` but the bail outs worked for portugal '' ... etc. 
  truly no similarities . 
  spot on !, 
   germany was propped up after the war due to geopolitical reasons , people tend to forget that being the designated main battle ground for ww3 was part of the whole deal . 
  woah !, 
  do you realize what you just said ? 
  `` part of the deal that germany was the designated ground for wwiii ?!?!? '', 
  who made that deal ? 
  with whom ? 
  i ca n't believe what i just read . 
  all our countries were targeted by the soviet nukes you seem to forget . 
  also no one chose your country to be the center of it all and no agreement was made about it . 
  do you forget why both american and soviet forces came there ? 
  i really ca n't believe what you just wrote trying to defend your self-righteousness . 
  so much self-righteousness is not healthy . 
   the german debt was a result of reparation payments imposed by the winners of the world war . 
  oh really ?? 
  i could be wrong but i thought that they also took `` loans '' from the countries they occupied and also caused lots of destruction too . 
  leverage ? 
  none !, 
  funny though one should need leverage among his `` european family '' that `` only wants to help '' the masks are coming down ... 
  i do understand why everyone gets angry when discovers he is being spied . 
  i really do . 
  i find funny though two things : - when you expect the other `` party '' to do anything needed to be surprised when finding out that `` what is needed '' is defined by him . 
  - to be 2015 to realize that everyone spies on everyone . 
  especially the big ones . 
  unfortunately yes my friend . 
  broomsticks and harsh language ... 
  let me be clear then : no one has to be receptive to `` our plight '' . 
  no one even has to be remotely sympathetic . 
  also all opinions are valid . 
  no problem with that at all . 
  what is unacceptable though is that when we express the view that the program is wrong and unproductive to be hit with the cliche `` greeks always blame the others '' in every possible variant . 
  the fact that the program is wrong and that the measures proposed in it unproductive is also stated by the imf itself . 
  nothing to do with `` sympathy '' or whatever . 
  just basic economics . 
  also i dont expect europe to come to my resque . 
  they can send us to hell . 
  it 's their right and their choice to do so and if they think they should do it they by all means they should go ahead . 
  i cant accept though to be blamed for ** whatever choice ** i might make : * if we make the agreement then `` the damn lazy greeks are taking advantage of us '' - if we dont make the agreement then `` the damn idiot greeks have the nerve to ask more '' how much simpler can i put it ? 
  surely you can as it seems :d but it aint the same by far . 
  an economic catastrophe is different than the loss of sovereignty . 
  dont believe me though . 
  ask an ukrainian who unfortunately has to face both . 
  they 'll tell you which is worse . 
  also as far as i understand it ... : * what greece has done in the ez : failed miserably to follow the rules due to corrupt politicians , now faces the consequences and is also mocked . 
  * what everyone 's done in nato ( except the us and greece ) : failed miserably to follow the rules due to hypocritical politicians and blame the us for taking the burden to defend them . 
  no one mock 's them though . 
  :p also the eu supposedly is more than a military aliance . 
  not ? 
  i will reply your question once and for all : who the hell said anything about bailing out these people ? 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  we replied to / r/buckfost 's post :  `` greece has become an upside-down world where no one feels * ashamed * about not paying their debts . '', 
  this is incredibly serious that we are in an economic union with these people . 
  the question was the morality of those people that chose to feed their kids over paying the mortgage putting in danger their property . 
  no one said anything about bailing them out . 
  is that clear enough now ? 
  isnt it ** obvious ** ?!?!??!, 
  the mortgages are also much higher than those in easten europe . 
  you see the mortgages were made before the crisis and still have those pre crisis values . 
  the incomes have gone down by 40 % if not lost at all ( 25 % unemplloyment and 60 % among the youth ), 
  no , government speding is dictated by the troika for some years now . 
  when the fuss is about matters like pensions for instance , i would think it pretty obvious that government spending is not a free choice . 
  also please , please , please !, 
  stop that mantra `` blame someone else '' whenever a greek makes a point . 
  a point can be correct or wrong . 
  your view on it , is very welcome the blanket cliche `` always someone else 's fault '' nonsense that greeks are always getting hit with , is no less than `` shut the fuck up cause you are greek '' . 
  well we fucked up in a major way , we pay the grim consequences but as far as i know we still have the right of an opinion and the freedom to express it . 
  2 different issues . 
  bail out agreements force that over taxation . 
  this has profound consequences to the real economy . 
  so at the next bail out even more overtaxion is needed . 
  a vicious circle actually that imf itself pointed out ( i am talking about the overtaxion not the errors in their implemented programs ) . 
  where these extra taxes are going to be spend ( debt repayment or other purposes ) is irrelevant on what their effects on the economy will be . 
  edit : hmm nope according to the schedule , the bail out payments are already happening . 
  in fact the hardest year is 2015 . 
  in order for the 1st bail out to take place the agreement was that greece would raise an extra 3.8 billion euros in taxes . 
  for the second one the agreement was that greece would raise an extra 3.9 billion euros in taxes . 
  for this one if the agreement happens the extra taxes to be raised are 7.9 billion taxes . 
  we will saved !, 
  you dont seem to understand what an economic crisis is . 
  it is not only the lowering of the living standards . 
  wish it was only that . 
  it is lives interupted . 
  you have a job you can pay your mortgage . 
  you lose you job or if you are lucky enough you keep your job but your income goes down 40 % ( as it happened to everyone in greece ) , hence you can not pay your mortgage and feed your family .
