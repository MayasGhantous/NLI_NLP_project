  - our language is totally different to turkish . 
  turkish sounds awful to our ears . 
  probably because turkish is not indo-european . 
  slavic languages also do n't sound good to us . 
  very different set of sounds . 
  the best sounding foreign language to us is italian that uses almost the same set of `` sounds '' . 
  spanish comes close . 
  - contrary to common belief to foreigners the two people ( greeks and ottomans ) lived in absolute apartheid . 
  the religious apartheid ( religion then was very significant ) is the stricter one . 
  also due to many reasons when the ottoman occupation happened the vast majority ( more than 90 % ) of the population deserted the cities and gone to the mountain areas where they formed autonomous communities . 
  most never even met an ottoman in their lives . 
  they send representatives to give the taxes and that 's all . 
  in essence the only city that remained was thessaloniki , the rest became large villages . 
  - during the ottoman occupation , the number of ottomans never exceeded 10 % of the population . 
  - hugely different civilization backgrounds even with our othodox christian neighbors . 
  they ( our neighbors ) very often perceive that as arrogance from the greeks . 
  even nowadays . 
  thank you for your reply !, 
  the more to the past the nicer sounds to me . 
  as if it is more `` south '' european soundings . 
  i know that is n't the case but the sounds are more `` easy '' on my ears , the words more `` clear '' . 
  big surprise is the way `` r '' is sounding . 
  exactly as in south european languages . 
  is modern norwegian that different than the 15th century one ? 
  i was much surprised to see subtitles . 
  greek has n't changed that much in the last 2000 years . 
  the language the bible was written is perfectly understood . 
  like 100 % . 
  please . 
  since you are talking about greece 's problems and what should be done , then you should also know that it is ** forbidden ** to greece to take any measures battling tax fraud if this is not approved by the troika first . 
  greek governments ask this repeatedly . 
  what is unfortunate is that it is not on the table of discussions as other matters are more pressing in the eyes of the troika . 
  like upping the vat or cutting the pensions even more . 
  greek governments repeatedly put that on the table of negotiations yet it was dismissed but the troika . 
  first of all i want to reassure you that nope , the question of ukraine and russia doesnt look remotely like funny to us . 
  quite the contrary . 
  i made a `` funny '' post and concluded that ** we ** are a circus . 
  we call this a union and in reality everyone is looking for his own interests and gives no fuck for the rest . 
  we call ourselves `` the european family '' . 
  what a joke !, 
  do families operate this way ? 
  you say `` we do n't wo n't muslims , they are dangerous '' . 
  by your very own logic , you show that you do n't care who of us keeps `` the dangerous '' ones . 
  we also have the right not to be over run , italy too . 
  send us your ukranian immigrants . 
  we will gladly take them in . 
  fine people with the same mentality and cultural background that will easily integrate to our society . 
  but honestly do n't you see that you 're hiding behind them ? 
  greece should never be part of the ez ( italy too as it seems ) i agree , but that is another matter . 
  i guess we are on the road that leads to those countries ( uk , scandinavia etc. ), 
  much difference . 
  even if eu gives money to the financial institutions the way syriza ( and former governments ) ask . 
  ie for the money that eu fives to the financial institutions specific actions are required from the greek government . 
  that 's not a bad thing per se if those actions are positive . 
  if not then harm is done . 
  an example is the state owned lottery firm . 
  a firm with large profits every year . 
  the troika asked for its immediate privatization . 
  guess what happened !, 
  there was an international contest and it was sold . 
  the price was that of the profits it made in 2 years . 
  so when syriza ( and the former govs ) are saying that it is not wise to sell assets now that their price is lower than their true value , they are right . 
  no one listens though . 
  nothing bad mate !, 
  i have nothing against somalis . 
  they are fine people no different that anyone else . 
  to what i was referring as a difference is that in one case immigrants are extremely poor people and on the other are people that chose to leave their countries cause of needs less severe . 
  somalis need support and must be given that . 
  others do n't need it so much . 
  nonsense indeed they did present alternative means to achieve the primary surplus yet they were dismissed . 
  what the troika asks to be done will hurt the economy even more . 
  the soft loan you talk about is toxic under such conditions . 
  even the imf acknowledged that the measures alone with no debt relief will make the plan not viable . 
  yet debt relief is out of the question . 
  if defaulting is inevitable then the sooner it happens the better . 
  5 years of wrong measures proved it . 
  greece : `` now that i have low interest rates , i will borrow like mad '' eu partners : you damn greeks are so hypocritical . 
  you borrow , now we have to pay for your shit . 
  uk : i have an interest on bombing saddam . 
  who gives a shit what happens next , others will pay for my shit . 
  --  woohoo isis here !, 
  that fucker gaddafi !, 
  i 'll bomb the shit out of him . 
  i have an interest there !, 
  who gives a shit what happens next , others will pay for my shit . 
  -  woohoo a void & isis here !!, 
  everyone be supportive !, 
  slap that bear with sanctions . 
  italy & greece : help !, 
  we are overrun !, 
  do we have to pay for your shit ? 
  eu : take them in !, 
  eu partners : hahahahahhah keep them !, 
  none of our business . 
  you pay for our shit . 
  ladies and gentlemen this is the eu circus !, 
  also many of their countries of origin wo n't accept them back . 
  like pakistan for instance . 
  ... and somalis , and pakistanis , and lybian etc etc. 
  if defaulting is inevitable then the sooner the better .
