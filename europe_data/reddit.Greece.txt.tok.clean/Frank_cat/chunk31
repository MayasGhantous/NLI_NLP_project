  that is n't a bad thing . 
  what is bad is that they served lots of false info to the public . 
  you know a `` scandal '' and what is provocative always sells more . 
  regardless on what is going to happen be prepared that in the following years , many of what they fed you , are going to be proven lies . 
  you have n't got a clue , do you ? 
  all the fuss that is being happening i.e. 
  what will make the economy better ? 
  more austerity vs less austerity is about paying the debts . 
  this 70 % that want stay in the ez are definitely for paying the debts . 
  what is being negotiating is which way is better for the debts to be payed . 
  it 's too early in the day for another circle jerk round, 
  i dare not to disagree with you on that . 
  my english can never be as good as yours so you have a seriously better understanding on the use of english words . 
  to my defense , i only new : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sheeple imo the best target group for any politician . 
  anyway ... 
  thank you brother !, 
  since you are going to take good care of her , i feel totally free to lose that one final screw !, 
  bless you !, 
  a huge weight 's lifted from my shoulders !,

  yeah we are some kind of a privileged child in an odd way : everyone loves to hate us !, 
  of course you have the right to express your opinion ... and of course to be criticized for it . 
  also whatever adonis is , that is irrelevant . 
  the public 's support for staying in the ez is above 70 % . 
  so if you want to `` understand exactly what kind of demonstration is '' you have to think about that 70 % . 
  and if adonis is trying to highjack it then go stand somewhere far from him but do n't dismiss the demonstration itself . 
  imo etc. . 
  sometimes . 
  it depends who 's making them . 
  for * some * the general public have stricter views . 
  not really . 
  support for the ez is above 70 % as multiple recent polls have shown . 
  also this government was elected on the clear promise that it wo n't drive us out of the ez . 
  so realization was always there . 
  what the government tactics or plans are is something totally different . 
  and does that make it a less valid one ? 
  do these people deserve their wishes to be heard less ? 
  are n't they citizens that are entitled of expressing their views ? 
  you can disagree with them all you want but their views are as valid as yours . 
  besides the theme of the demonstration was `` stay in the ez '' not support nd and pasok . 
  why ? 
  we have plenty of them in my country . 
  it is proven again and again over the years . 
  a politician ( member of the government ) announcing a military channel ( which already is out of the question for the government ) in the middle of an extremely harsh crisis . 
  at the same time military expenses are decided to be cut by the same government ... who do you think his target group was ? 
  i do n't get it btw ... - when a greek says that something else than his own government foolish acts is wrong ( too ) ... then he 's `` blaming others and do n't accept his responsibilities '' - when a greek is critical on his own government and people ... then he 's not serious . 
  guys please , in a short while i 'll have to develop multiple personalities to keep up and nhs isnt working properly to take care of me . 
  and do n't think of me , but if i loose it what will happen to my cat ? 
  who 's gon na take care of her ? 
  wont happen . 
  just some more news exclusively for sheeple . 
  ffs get a grip dude !, 
  double standards in the eu is something you 've never heard before ? 
  you are definitely wrong . 
  tax avoidance is exclusively a greek thing . 
  regardless of what happens to my country ( no one knows what syriza is thinking , not even themselves ) , as the euro currently is i am pessimistic . 
  meaning that many countries already are in trouble and they will continue to slip deeper . 
  just take a look at that : http://www.tradingeconomics.com/italy/government-debt-to-gdp portugal that is considered a success story for the troika is at 130.2 % debt gdp ratio , which means nothing 's really solved ( regardless of the pain the portuguese people had to suffer ) and italy at 132.1 % ( higher than what greece had before the troika medicine ) . 
  unfortunately there is no sign that countries in the ez are willing to fix the euro wrongs . 
  they just keep kicking the can down the road . 
  good for germany . 
  i hope they do n't get a lot of bashing like `` they are breaking the eu common decision on sanctions '' , `` they are forgetting their allies and side up with russia '' etc that greece got about the very same reason : a pipeline . 
  nope it 's not pro-eu demonstration . 
  it 's pro - ez demonstration . 
   https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/71/acropolis_now_ ( economist_cover , _ may_1_2010 ) . jpg yeah it was very popular !, 
  yeah i 've seen the movie !, 
  hahahahahaha, 
  `` just put some windex on it '' papandreou . 
  rotfl !!!, 
  edit to explain : in greece , papandreou is unanimously regarded as the dumbest politician ever !, 
  from his initials ** g ** eorge ** a ** ndreas ** p ** apandreou nowadays is mostly called g.a.p ( reference to his mind abilities ), 
  of course it is not different in that it 's equally unacceptable and disgusting . 
  no doubt about that . 
  there is a difference though as a politician is targeted and not a nation . 
  disgusting in every way but different also . 
  i would n't know . 
  it is from a humorist show . 
  a show that is mocking us to . 
  in the very same video . 
  far from being used to dismiss a german 's pov or to belittle them as a nation . 
  there 's no analogy . 
  i understand what you are saying but the use of said cliche stereotypes to belittle a nation or people who belong to it , is clear cut racism . 
  racism is not only about different races as some people might think . 
  it is about using a cliche , a stereotype to judge a group or a person by it and not by real characteristics or actions . 
  to see my nation called '' ** a nation of lazy fucks ** '' is offensive and provocative . 
  it is racism too cause `` lazy '' is something we are not but it is used repeatedly only to offend us . 
  it is not an isolated incident too . 
  it 's being said for years even by media . 
  as for the system ... it is not the average joe that has a saying on it . 
  the average person struggles to get by and that 's all . 
  it is not that they are `` lazy fucks '' here and miraculously turn into working bees when in germany or in austria . 
  most probably they have to work less there since the system is n't broken . 
  nothing that greece goes through atm has to do about race , skin color , ethnicity etc. 
  everything that greece goes through atm is because of our incompetent and corrupt governments . 
  our fault and no one 's elses . 
  i fully agree . 
  pity though that i had to reply to two german redditors today for calling us `` a nation of lazy fucks '' and `` a ridiculous country '' . 
  so while our problems have nothing to do with race , racism is what we get for years now . 
  thank you !, 
  i wont read anything you say !,
