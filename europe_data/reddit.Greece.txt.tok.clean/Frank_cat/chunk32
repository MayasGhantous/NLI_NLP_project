  i dont care about what you think and how you would try to cover up you shallow existence . 
  i feel disgusted even writting this to you . 
  you stink !, 
  it is you that you should look the meaning of racism . 
  ask your grandad and granma . 
  they do have a pretty good idea . 
  mind !, 
  i am only talking about you personally and not about the german nation who are well respected and very decent people . 
  you have nothing to do with other germans . 
  you are just a blithering blatherskite uneasy with his own racistic nature . 
  trying to cover up with jokes your disgustingly racist comment doesnt help . 
  you think you are entitled to say such things ? 
  seriously : delete it and fucking apologize . 
  else you will be treated accordingly, 
  i truly hope they dont . 
  they dont have to support anyone , they dont have to help others to clean their shit , they dont even have to so sympathy . 
  but if they think like that `` nation of lazy fucks '' then they should be ready to be treated accordingly . 
  and with good reason too . 
  i hope they dont !, 
   that nation of lazy fucks ? 
  hold your horses internet warrior !, 
  '' ** nation ** of lazy fucks ? '', 
  really ? 
  you must apologize and delete that shit . 
  else you should not weep if people respond to you accordingly . 
  so apologize and delete it !, 
  i really hope the best for portugal but i am affraid that the true issues where never adressed . 
  as they havent been here . 
  with a debt on 130.2 % i dont think something trully major has happened for portugal so it wont slip in the abyss . 
   their ridiculous country come again ? 
  perhaps you want to change that . 
  calling a country `` ridiculous '' for economic reasons is far fetched dont you think ? 
   it worked for ireland and other peripheries did it ? 
  so after all this pain portugal for instance had to go through is out of the woods ? 
  with a debt at 130.2 % ? 
  i really hope the best for them ( that it worked , it was a success and they wont have a problem from now on ) . 
  i really do . 
  as an outsider i want to say that in my country always they are referred as * nazi concentration camps in poland * ( or whatever the place ) . 
  nazi , not german , nor polish . 
  also i 've never seen them called `` polish concentration camps '' in the international press . 
  never seen it . 
  if it happened - i do n't doubt it - i bet it would be cause of some idiot journalist who doesnt know how to write it correctly . 
  i can understand your anger and how unjust this feels especially when the polish people suffered so much ... but please be certain : no one is linking them camps with the polish people . 
  not in our thoughts , not even for a millisecond . 
  in our mind there is only one thought for you : great people , beautiful country . 
  lots of love to poland !, 
  you are welcome !, 
  i do n't think there are going to be large protests atm . 
  what is the people 's will is perfectly clear : they want the euro even if that will hurt . 
  as i said people are numb and with good reason . 
  if syriza manages to get us out of the euro though , they 'll have to leave the country . 
  that is way down atm . 
  fyi in that number are included teachers , priests and the army . 
  when it comes to the army not only professionals are included but also soldiers . 
  in greece every male has to go to the army for 9 months . 
  atm that number is a bit more than 50 % . 
  also the labor force is more than 5 million ( not 4 that 20 % implies ), 
  no the state ca n't be the only source of economic growth . 
  but if the state in times of a crisis of this magnitude can not stimulate growth at least it should put difficulties for growth to come . 
  more taxation of businesses , upping the vat etc do harm to private firms to achieve growth . 
  predictions so far off are not predictions . 
  they are a random bet . 
  is circle jerk time already ? 
  ok . and less than kim jong un got ( although he has a better haircut ) . 
  what exactly am i trying too deflect here ? 
  is n't it extremely idiotic to use that comparison ? 
  woah !, 
  i mean gah !, 
  it is . 
  and that is natural imo . 
  cause people are having it bad and at the same they know that there 's no solution ( growth ) for decades with this program . 
  this is true . 
  this is n't a solution just kicking the can down the road . 
  i doubt that the way he is fighting for it is going to bring a positive outcome . 
  tsipras for certain . 
  you do n't even have to ask . 
  the reality is that syriza itself doesnt have a clear idea on what they are . 
  if you ask 10 syriza politicians the same question you 'll get 11 answers !, 
  pasok is not anti-austerity . 
  kke is but i doubt they 'll enter the parliament next time . 
  their electorate base is continuously dropping . 
  the monstrosity of this government is the fact that two marginal ( until very recently ) parties came together . 
  one leftist and one almost at the far right . 
  anel certainly is n't at the center of the political stage . 
  already they down voted a syriza law proposal about giving citizenship to illegal immigrants ' children that are born here . 
  they are together when it comes to anti-troika stance but there ends their common view on the matters . 
  as it is now syriza has not the public 's ok for leaving the ez . 
  they got elected on the promise to get a better deal ( as if it was their decision ) but also to remain part of the euro at any cost . 
  public 's support on euro is over 70 % at the moment . 
  and already people - and not political parties - are organizing protests on friday where they want to say to the government : do n't leave the euro . 
  i do n't think they will be massive because most people here are feeling numb . 
  on one side is common sense ( stay in euro ) on the other is desperation ( no light at all on the horizon ) . 
  clearly polls show as i said more than 70 % backing for the euro . 
  the rest 30 % are not syriza voters ( more than half of syriza party are for euro ) but people that have almost nothing to lose ( and surely a part of syriza ) . 
  if elections were held now , i ca n't say with certainty what would happen . 
  syriza would play on desperation and false national dignity and the rest on fear . 
  such climate could bring pretty crazy results , although personal i think syriza would lose a large part of its electorate base . 
  the people punished those corrupt parties from the start ( since the data came known ) not just now . 
  get your data please : after the fall of papandreou gov 11 november 2011 - 16 may 2012 party : ** none ** national unity gov to make elections 16 may 2012 -20 june 2012 party : ** none ** caretaker gov after no party won and no coalition was possible 20 june 2012 - 26 january 2015 coalition of ** 4 ** parties 26 january 2015 - now coalition of ** 3 ** parties . 
  source https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_prime_ministers_of_greece does that seem to you that people did n't punish those shit ?
