  about corruption in uk or anywhere else , allow me to be skeptical cause corruption is shown only after something huge goes wrong . 
  it took years for instance for the fact that thatcher covered a paedophile member of her gov. 
  also as for how we think ... allow me to tell you that you know nothing . 
  you only see reactions here . 
  it would be a surprise to you what is being said in the . gr part of the net . 
  reactions here differ as we are always on the defense since for years the cliches were blanket statements like greeks are lazy etc. 
  also to add : the biggest problem of all we face is not the economy . 
  it is the fact that in our political arena only now new faces/parties started to emerge . 
  until now people had no choices ( i mean from 2011 and on ), 
  jesus christ man ... did i put the blame on anyone else but ourselves ? 
  you make assumptions on what i think and you come about snide and dismissing . 
  i 'm done too . 
  that is the idea of democracy ayatollahs have . 
  remember blair ordered the iraq bombing --  blair was democratically elected --  we are entitled to punish the british citizens cause they are responsible . 
  nowhere the fact that blair lied to all , nowhere the fact that not all voted for blair , nowhere the fact that many opposed blair . 
  good simplistic ayatollah thinking !, 
  and you give me advice on democracy !, 
  lol no !, 
  greece = government + opposition + those who did n't vote . 
  it is only technically that are n't a minority gov. 
  due to a system that gives the 1st part a large bonus of sits . 
  have i said that i do n't like democracy ? 
  or is it because syriza was elected , syriza also expresses my views ? 
  it seems that you are the one who brinks russia in our chat . 
  a blanket statement `` greece voted for him '' hence syriza and greece are one and the same atm . 
  :p seriously ... 
  i have n't voted for syriza . 
  also syriza is a minority government . 
  and that mantra `` democratically elected governments so their shit is the people 's fault '' is so damn wrong i ca n't even begin . 
  edit to add : syriza got the 36.3 % of the vote . 
  aka of those who turned in to vote . 
  or else the 36.3 % of the 64.87 % that bothered to vote . 
  many did n't show up cause there was no one who clearly deserved to be voted ( not my opinion but a very common one here ) . 
  that makes that syriza had the confidence of the 23.55 % of those who had the right to vote . 
  hardly syriza equals greece . 
  the sale can not be avoided to be recorded . 
  the product is electronically recorded at the source : i.e. 
  where the retailer bought it before they sell it to you . 
  as for the minimum wage yes that can happen but it 's not the employee 's fault . 
  a very common thing the last few years is this : you work for months without being paid at all and at the end they tell you `` sorry , we ca n't pay you . 
  off you go '' or the company , suddenly moves its operations outside the borders in some more tax friendly eu country ( mostly bulgaria ) . 
  it is far from cute . 
  and i ca n't take the blame for it . 
  i am the victim of it . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  if you are working for a salary in a company , how can you do tax evasion ? 
  the company that pays you , presents your salary as expenses . 
  how can you - the receiver - hide it ? 
  what is that you can do under the table ? 
  greece = / = syriza just to make it clear . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7fxjoyxl7i :d ( just felt like trolling a bit ) have a great time anywhere you go !, 
  pretty accurate !, 
  have an up vote for your good effort !, 
  the question is that 50 % ( i do n't think it correct but it doesnt matter ) is about who actually ? 
  is it distributed equally to the population ( i.e. 
  half the population doesnt pay or pay less that it should ? ), 
  or is it the top 10 % ? 
  if it 's the latter then it 's hardly the national sport everyone talks about . 
  it is not that greece is against reforming the tax system . 
  not as far as i know of . 
  in fact one of the election promises syriza made was exactly that . 
  i am not a syriza voter myself but this was one of their promises . 
  also as far as i know reforming the tax collection system was never seriously on the table - i wish it were - only raising the taxes , vat etc. 
  some things i know of about the `` tax evasion '' that has blown out of proportion by the media . 
  the largest % of the work force in greece live on a salary ( both because they work in public or in private sector ) . 
  so it is impossible to us to evade taxes . 
  on the other hand large firms , multinational firms and ship owners do . 
  how ? 
  by sheer blackmailing : they owe to the state millions in taxes , they do n't give them and if the government tries to collect then they say in such case we leave and let 1000s of people out of work . 
  many have already done so and moved their operations to bulgaria for example . 
  but these are the things i know . 
  i do n't have more concrete knowledge on the matter . 
  so when you provide a link to show the data you talk about make sure you provide the right one plz . 
  the one you provided was a totally different one . 
  very interesting graph though : italy while greece is at 103.7 , italy is at 108.2 % !, 
  portugal that was totally fine at the time 53.8 found herself at 123.6 % in 2012 ... 
  so does these give any more insight besides the fact that greece cooked its books from 103.7 % to make it an `` acceptable '' for the ez 103 % ? 
  so let it happen then . 
  but lets not call bail outs a fine solution to the problem . 
  as for the tax system in order to be changed troika must agree to it else it is not allowed to be changed by greece on her own . 
  tax system change , curiously were never part of the negotiations though . 
   instead of getting the banks to pay for their spending , they try to make the eurozone tax payers pay for it . 
  who is asking for that ? 
  do you know ? 
  actually who did it already ? 
  do you have an idea ? 
  be informed : greece and the imf : who exactly is being saved ? 
   2001 as greece entered the ez with the actually deficit of 103,7 % of there gdp . 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  where did you find that number ? 
  from the link ** you ** posted : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_financial_audit,_2004 `` the requirement that the 1999 budget deficit should have been ** below 3 % of gdp ** was one of the key criteria for eurozone entry ; thus , its revision to 3.1 % , ** the precise figure was actually 3.07 % ** , according to eurostat ( ameco ) , led to a controversy about greece 's admission . '', 
  and with such a monstrous difference from reality , you have the nerve to lol ? 
  do you even understand what you are saying ? 
  mixing totally different thing as ** gdp deficit ** with ** budget deficit ** ? 
  are you for real ? 
  or are you here only to mock and play the blame game ? 
  reforms have been made contrary to what is the general view on the matter : https://rwer.wordpress.com/2015/02/17/reforms-in-greece-an-exemplary-record-but-the-wrong-track-3-graphs/ as for the * `` incoming and outgoing sums match '' * ... they can match wether the surplus is at 0.75 % or 0.8 % or 1.5 % or 3 % . 
  the higher the surplus - in the middle of a severe crisis - the harder the real economy is hit and the harder for it to recover and sustain those surpluses . 
  it is a vicious circle . 
  the fact that the budget remains balanced is easy for ez to check , so to base purely on `` fear '' the non productive on economy measures is false .
