  it says `` everything is fine cause solidarity is the strong force that takes eu to a brilliant future '' ... ... not !, 
  seriously i have !, 
  have ** you ** heard about this ? '', 
  ** deutsche bank ** , the largest german lender , ** has struggled to restore an image tarnished by a raft of regulatory and legal problems ** . 
  the financial institution has recently been ** facing probes into alleged manipulation of benchmark interest rates and derivatives , tax evasion and money laundering ** . '',

  you make easy assumptions to `` win '' an argument . 
  you are wrong to thing that the ez was tricked by the greek govs. 
  everyone knew that at the time and many others done it too . 
  it was a minor trick that hid about a billion so to make the debt under 60 % . 
  you seem to think that those govs had a plan to amass such a debt . 
  they did n't . 
  they were only incompetent ( among other things ) and did n't care for their country . 
  most of them now are under judicial investigations here . 
  their parties have collapsed to oblivion too . 
  for example pas ok went from 46 % to barely above 3 % . 
  to think that people here knew and voted them is far from the truth . 
  lastly i repeat . 
  the debt as much as it was , was still easy to make it sustainable . 
  it was at 112 or 116 % ( ca n't recall exactly ) . 
  the bail out programs made it 70 % worst . 
  edit to add : if they reach an agreement now , it is estimated that the debt will go to 200 % . 
  it was amassed from the actions of incompetent and corrupt governments in greece . 
  100 % our fault and no one else 's . 
  it was made even worse by the wrongly planned bailout programs . 
  then they are fools who know nothing about economy . 
  as i said , government debts only need to be sustainable . 
  that way , lenders do not lose their money . 
  for a debt to be sustainable it is enough to be under 100 % of gdp . 
  now the bail out programs took it from 116 % to 180 % . 
  how smart and productive that was ? 
  did i say that debt was forced upon greece ? 
  how can i offer an explanation on something i never said and i do n't believe ? 
  but this way they making it sure the '' ll never get their money back !, 
  also it is very different than your analogy . 
  government debts are never meant to be fully repaid back . 
  the idea is to make them sustainable . 
  that way no one loses money . 
  do you see the troika planning doing anything remotely like that ? 
  totally out of context . 
  they did cooked up the books ( as did others too like italy etc. ), 
  but that was n't the reason the debt was amassed . 
  if you wan na say that greece should n't be allowed into the ez , then i fully agree , otherwise that link is irrelevant . 
  nope austerity also means raising vat and taxes by 270 % in 5 years . 
  that has grave consequences to businesses . 
  remember ireland ? 
  and how taxes for foreign firms were lowered ? 
  and how much bashing ireland had to face from certain other countries for doing so ? 
  now these `` certain '' countries are using ireland as a success example ? 
  yeah it was very successful cause the irish did the right thing and ignored them . 
  fair enough !, 
  only two points : - lowering pensions and upping the vat are n't reforms . 
  nor will they push greese into a modern state . 
  that 's what they are talking about now . 
  and those are the things they keep apart all the parties involved from reaching an agreement . 
  in fact upping the vat will do harm to business etc. 
  remember ireland how much bashing she got exactly because they lowered the taxes and attracted large multinational firms and that was regarded unfair by * some * other member states ? 
  ireland did right to ignore them and that helped them to recover . 
  - i can understand that there is no trust to the greek government . 
  hell , i do n't trust them myself why should they ? 
  the fact that remains though is that the plans they want to implement are not sustainable purely in economic terms . 
  no way what they are asking to be done , will make the economy even slightly better . 
  no austerity was a successful plan that took a debt from 112 % of gdp to almost 180 % of the gdp . 
  huge success i 'm telling you !, 
  again . 
  the banks never got lied in this case . 
  nothing was presented to them . 
  ever . 
  no one arsehole lied to them . 
  they knew what the were doing pretty well , they just got greedy . 
  just as the arseholes that took the loans . 
  i have nothing to `` duke '' too . 
  if the state must repay it for you , then after are done with repaying it should n't the state own as much of the bank as the sum of the repayment ? 
  also , should n't the bankers that done such a grave mistake be punished ? 
  seen anything remotely like this ? 
  so what was your point initially ? 
  that the banks were lied to . 
  if you have any indication whatsoever that the banks were victims of lies then enlighten us and give us some data , not `` ifs '' and your personal `` assumptions '' . 
  i stand corrected sir !, 
  you indeed are right !, 
  banks as proven again and again are not run by idiots . 
  banks love to take risks cause risks are giving them the prospect of higher profits . 
  banks are as responsible when giving loans as the one that gets them . 
  do n't understand it ? 
  ok . go tomorrow to the bank of your choice and ask them for a 500 mil loan . 
  do you think they will give it to you ? 
  if they give it to you , would they not be as irresponsible as you that is asking for it ? 
  and if the deal goes tits up , cause you wo n't be able to repay it ... should the state repay it for you ? 
  or should both you and the bank face the consequences cause you 've both acted irresponsibly ? 
  starting to get the picture now ? 
  franko ? 
  is that you ? 
  gawd !, 
  the `` greek '' above was making the exact opposite point , but you 've missed it . 
  completely . 
  in fact `` the greek '' was ** only ** making the complete opposite point . 
  also , in case of war between greece and turkey , nato would not intervene . 
  many times that the two states came very close to an arm conflict , nato did not intervene . 
  all and all your post is very `` precious '' : it is very rare indeed to witness something so stupid to be said with such ... confidence !,
