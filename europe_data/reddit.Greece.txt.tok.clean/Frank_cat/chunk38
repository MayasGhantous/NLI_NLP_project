  there is no will for something like that and also that was the idea in the 1st place when they brought the imf in . 
  you ca n't ask the imf to get in when it suits you and then tell it to go away when it doesnt . 
  so what seems to be the problem ? 
  the imf does play the hardball as they were supposed to . 
  indeed they are mate !, 
  they both escaped half naked what does that say about the reaction of the chinese ? 
  that they were n't trying to detain them . 
  also what gives you the idea that i 'm all for letting thieves go ? 
  and yes , i most definitely would feel bad when violence is used regardless of their ethnicity . 
  finally i feel bad for the thieves victims . 
  yeah , not violence except a few slaps , kicks and the stripping . 
  my post about how depressing is to see people thinking of violence as the right thing to do , is also about the comments ( aka not only the incident on video ) . 
  also it seems quite ridiculous on how so many men were trying to detain them for the police to arrive , yet they slipped away half-naked . 
  yeah sure , it 's the police they were waiting for ... 
  never !!!, 
  death to the lizard overlords !, 
  all hail to the glorious cat ruler of the world !, 
  it seems you ca n't pass beyond the drama queen stage , can you ? 
  be my guest and do it to your heart 's content sweetie pie . 
  just do n't expect me to be part of that . 
  did i say anything remotely like that ? 
  show it to me please . 
  pah !, 
  it 's depressing to see how many people see violence as the right thing to do . 
   well they are fairly close and ** from what i do know ** , no family or health issues or any other special circumstances . 
  from their own words ( ... ) they did n't use some super-special loophole you said '' ** from what i do know ** '' so yes i do read what you right . 
  do you understand what you write though ? 
  ** from what you do know ** leaves one to wonder . 
  yes we do n't need this . 
  varoufakis might be out of touch with reality but what you just wrote is beyond stupid . 
  if they are fairly close then ask them . 
  do n't draw conclusions so easily though . 
  they might have some health issue that you do n't know about and they do n't want to reveal to you . 
  i do n't know , that 's how they are being taxed . 
  as if they have a net income of 16000 euros ( which is quite high by todays standards ) . 
  it 's the tax law , what 's the theory behind that , i do n't know . 
  but they ca n't be blamed for tax evasion if they wo n't give you a receipt . 
  but what is their story ? 
  that is n't normal so there is a story behind those . 
  so you do n't know , yet you 've got the right amount of info to post . 
  seriously ... 
  are they ? 
  lol, 
  the one from the banking sector definitely doesnt get his pension from the state . 
  those for the tourism section sound very odd . 
  what 's their insurance ? 
  how come ? 
  what is their story ? 
  it is rare . 
  how many people you personally know to have retired at 50 . 
  in fact do you know anyone at all ? 
  not hearsay or media prop cause they want to pass some political agenda . 
  the receipt he gave you is for your own use . 
  taxi drivers ( not owners ) are being taxed for a 16000 euro income regardless of what they make . 
  so even if you wo n't be given a receipt , that doesnt mean he evades tax . 
  most `` math/physics/english / french/greek teachers '' by far are civil servants , so they ca n't . 
  of those who work in the private sector tutoring also the largest percentage work in a salary ( frontistiria ) . 
  a small percentage are giving private tutoring cause simply enough its too damn expensive . 
  hardly they 'd make a sum worth mentioning as to influence the state budget . 
  where do you draw your data from ? 
  or is it just to make an impression ? 
  as for the doctors , where the heck do you go and they do n't give you a receipt ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
  how would they prescribe medicine if they wo n't provide a receipt ? 
  seriously dude ... 
  yes . 
  only due to our geographic location we have a large army ( in analogy to those countries ) and also to spend almost 7 % of our budget for military expenses . 
  in fact we and the us are the only nato countries that spend more than 2 % of the budget on military . 
  the rest of the eurozone , can afford to equip their army with broomsticks instead of riffles . 
  and this is n't a joke : http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2015/02/19/germanys-army-is-so-under-equipped-that-it-used-broomsticks-instead-of-machine-guns/, 
  exaggerated in that it mostly is about the rich powerful and large companies . 
  the average joe even if he 's able to pull something like that it would be not considerable for the budget . 
  to give you an example ship owners pay almost none or none . 
  how ? 
  cause they give work to lots of people , they bring lots of income to the economy and are able to say to the government : if you tax us more we leave . 
  so yes there is a tax evasion problem the part of it that come from the average joe is not as it is presented . 
  i live on a salary ( as more than half of the greeks ) , so it is simply impossible to hide my income , yet i 'm tagged as a con and a tax evader . 
  honestly ? 
  they do n't understand vaffanculo ?? 
  hahahahaha you can make so many jokes then !, 
  if a girl gets you upset , you can look her in the eye , smile and tell her : tu sei scrofa !, 
  lol, 
  blood money . 
  even if we starve we will defend our country . 
  worry not yourself . 
  you should worry about your hypocritical standards you live by . 
  oh and donate a broomstick to your army . 
  ahahaa we are paranoid too ? 
  as if you know anything about it . 
  the funny part though is how easily you skipped the `` germany is not meeting its obligations '' part and went straight to call us paranoid . 
  what is this really german hypocrisy ? 
  is it typical ? 
  ffs you `` re so full of shit when you pretend you have the right to judge others on morality terms . 
  pathetic !, 
  you simply do not know what you are talking about . 
  you simplify reality cause maybe it is easier for you to live by . 
  you compare two very different countries with a huge difference in the crisis magnitude to draw whatever conclusions suit you . 
  a typical thing we 've seen from german politicians and media . 
  i 'll give one simple example : germany always failed to meet its nato obligations to spend more than 2 % of its budget on military spendings . 
  germany never met that !,
