  the rest of humanity that will have to live with your children . 
  excuse my ignorance please but what are the hvaardi ? 
  yeah i do know of that article . 
  it 's a joke actually : '' the other member states shall have towards it an obligation of ** aid and assistance ** by all the means in their power '' . 
  in other words italy will send spaghetti , we 'll provide feta & ouzo etc. 
  sorry , but this is bull . 
  greece that has the burden of big military expenses ( not because we are psychos btw ) is asking since it got into the eu , that the eu would guarantee its borders . 
  so we 'd be able to spend less . 
  not even discussable . 
  daniel marc cohn-bendit also made that proposal in the eu parliament at the start of our economic crisis . 
  he too failed . 
  so no my friend , better to not kid ourselves . 
  i know buddy . 
  i do care alot about them , being in the eu family . 
  aslo being an eu member would do them little good in such a ( hopefully unthinkable ) case , as the eu has no army to help them . 
  it 's nato that does . 
  sadly i have to agree . 
  for many other reasons too , that i dont want to point atm as i like germany very much . 
  finland and sweden . 
  i have the best feelings for these countries and i dearly hope they will never have to face any external agression whatsoever . 
  they do meet the criteria you put though . 
  at least they do try . 
  on their own too as they are not a nato member . 
  tis getting better all the time !, 
  do you think the american , british and french occupation was bad ? 
  you should try the german version of an occupation sweetie pie !, 
  it is then that you should come back with your statements !, 
  the occupation on the western part of germany was so atrocious it inspited stories like this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8usey3jugmm, 
  some drama , a tad of tragedy and lots of surrealism !, 
  we do our very best !, 
  for not being hateful as the rest of us !, 
  nowadays i think the least least hated country in eu is greece . 
  - bows deeply -, 
  omg !, 
  is that an attempt in humor ?!? 
  with a slight touch of cynicism ? 
  it was educational after all then . 
  well done my old son , with lots of effort and endless repetitions you will finally get to hope to cross the uncharted , wide , wild , dark ocean that lies between you and true humor . 
  what exactly 's that you 've found cool , sweetie pie ? 
  `` fools are my theme , let satire be my song '' as lord byron so eloquently put it . 
  why do you think i was being sarcastic cause i would supposedly find * `` violence '' * more effective ? 
  that 's quite a leap , aint it hon ? 
  i told ya . 
  do n't be so serious , you come about the wrong way . 
  almost constipated . 
  did i say i have a problem ? 
  did i mention violence ? 
  you are seeing things my dear . 
  it is you that brought it up !, 
  not only that , but you were being snide when wit is obviously not your prime characteristic . 
  to help you : it is being called humor all around the civilized world . 
  loosen up you do n't have to be so serious . 
  violence is out of the question and that is a big step forward for mankind . 
  on the other hand , hypocricy has increased accordingly . 
  that means violence is acceptable when retaliation is impossible : see spreading of democracy in iraq , lybia etc. . 
  not really a step back . 
  i see it as his way of making `` diplomatic negotiations '' . 
  he might be talking about debt restructuring to kingdom come . 
  he knows it wont happen now . 
  so this '' debt restructuring '' mentions , is also an alibi ( in reality ) to the other part to say he isnt collaborating . 
  i am not a syriza voter or fan . 
  it is wrong though to assume based on their background . 
  now they are in power and feel a pressure they 've never felt again . 
  am not talking about the troika pressure . 
  i am talking the pressure from the greek citizens . 
  in recent polls more than 70 % of the people say they want to stay in the ez and also for an agreement . 
  the simply can not afford to ignore that . 
  they might be a government but they havent got a carte blanche . 
  edit : i would also like to add , that i have no trust in tripras . 
  i have the same trust though to his counterpart parts too : zero . 
  according to trustful sources in kremlin , after this strong criticism , putin was seen standing in a corner weeping . 
  it doesnt matter anymore . 
  according to reuters a new proposal was issued by the greek gov. 
  in any case the pention cuts ( at this time ) is the only problem for the gr gov. 
  here it is from the horse 's mouth : http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/09/us-eurozone-greece-iduskbn0oo0yv20150609, 
  i apologize for the `` toxic '' part of the comment !, 
  edit : there is a timeline in the 47pages draft proposals the greek government made . 
  it is online . 
  all these you discuss are already in the greek government draft proposal . 
  it is not that they are against reforming the pension system . 
  it 's time they ask . 
  you can look it up youself . 
  and thank you for downvoting me for expressing my opinion . 
  it seems toxic to talk to you but i dont mind , 
  again : these are not the problem per se . 
  the time given for such restructuring to be implemented is the problem . 
  the imf already has aknowledged that its plan and proposals were ** wrong ** . 
  what do we see ? 
  the complete will for that wrong to be implemented without questions asked , ** immediately **, 
  of course it does need to be severely reformed . 
  to be completely restructured . 
  and not because people that recieved pentions didnt put enough money in it but for several other reasons ( ie they lost huge amounts of money with the debt cut - remember it ? - etc. ), 
  but whatever the reasons it is not viable as it is . 
  we know that . 
  in order to make true restructuring you need time to do so . 
  in the middle of a severe economic crisis , the creditors are more focused on the `` cuts '' part than anything else . 
  this too would be fine , if other nonsense they 'd forced on our economy wouldnt make it a mission impossible : in an economy where the troika measures helped the unempoiment to rise beyond 27 % and youth unempoyment to 60 % the system simply can not have enough income . 
  the funny part is that before that ( 100 years ) they would kill anyone - among them - that claimed to be `` macedonian '' . 
  the truth is that they are indeed bulgarians . 
  you ai n't here to discuss .
