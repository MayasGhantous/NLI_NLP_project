  that 's fine . 
  bbye, 
  since you missed it the 1st time : http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevekeen/2015/02/17/for-greece-and-many-others-economic-reform-is-bad-for-your-economic-health/ read it and stop being an ill-informed ignominious ignoramus, 
  hardly in any position to be snide yourself . 
  are you ? 
  what do you mean that nothing 's been done ? 
  do you have any data to back this claim ? 
  cause i do and they prove otherwise . 
  better to do nothing if what you do is wrong . 
  just to brake your ignorance bubble : http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevekeen/2015/02/17/for-greece-and-many-others-economic-reform-is-bad-for-your-economic-health/, 
  greece needs to reform on several matters . 
  cutting the pensions and upping the taxes is hardly reforms though . 
  whatever people think you are , nordic , baltic , east europeans it doesnt matter . 
  it really means nothing . 
  you are perfectly fine as you are : lithuanians !, 
  thank you very much !, 
  no sir !, 
  greek and a drop of french . 
  you have paid a huge price on your actions to the government that taxes the shit out of the smokes . 
  next step is for the government too introduce penalties to those who are n't born 100 % healthy . 
  there is a huge degree of hypocrisy though . 
  the government wants its share of the profits from the selling of ciggies and yet it thinks it is so bad you should be punished for it . 
  there 's something fishy ... and we are n't at the fish market . 
  whatever makes you happy dear lithuanians !, 
  ( as if it 's something special ), 
  never mentioned the views of the `` average '' greek . 
  pah !, 
  said that i do n't see `` hate '' . 
  i doubt that you have a view on what an average greek thinks . 
  not is it possible to draw such conclusions from the people you met or hang with . 
  i 've seen pretty strong remarks about sch\u00e4uble and the likes that 's true . 
  but equally strong remarks against our very own politicians . 
  so here !, 
  hear hear !, 
  but as i said ... sadly we all have our equal share of idiots !, 
  as for mistreatment , just ask any fellow german that 's been here recently for his experience !, 
  have a very nice day !, 
  i for one , love germans and germany . 
  some of my best friends - almost feel them as family - are germans !, 
  and nope bild , its equivalent in greece and politicians ca n't change that . 
  i 'll never understand why some people care what others do with their sexuality and how they get their kicks . 
  totally incomprehensible . 
  greeks do n't hate you buddy . 
  you can scrub that off . 
  when you see a greek using strong language against germans it is : a ) to react to some german that used equally derogatory language ( i.e. 
  lazy greeks , liars , cons etc ) and/or b ) has an iq equal to that of a bild reader ( we too have idiots ) also do n't equalize the despise some here have/show towards certain people in your gov * cough * schaeuble * cough * with the feelings towards the german people . 
  no , there is n't any hate towards you mate . 
  greeks hate you ?!, 
  that 's a 1st ... 
  read it ? 
  '' ** medicine shortages ** , reported by greek health workers and patients for months , ** show signs of worsening as pharmaceutical companies become increasingly reluctant to deliver drugs on credit to a state whose debts to them are predicted to top $ 1.5 bn ** by the end of this month '' `` commercial pharmacies , which claim they are owed $ 540m by the eopyy , the main state health insurance fund , are insisting customers pay up front for medicines . 
  for many residents of a country in its fifth year of recession , that is simply not possible . 
  state pharmacies providing the most expensive drugs for free or at a fraction of the cost do exist -- but there are only 10 in the whole of greece . 
  konstantinos lourantas , chair of the parmacists ' association of the attica region in and around the capital , announced on thursday that his group was opening a bank account into which philanthropic individuals could make donations for expensive drugs . 
  but pharmacists , he added , could not continue `` replacing the state '' . 
  just from the 1st article . 
  look at it again : http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/08/greek-drug-shortage-worsens from the 2nd article : roche spokesperson daniel grotsky said the company is withholding some non-critical drugs until it is paid the 200 million euros it is owed by the greek state . 
  `` we are insisting ** that the public hospitals ** fulfill their contracts and this is something we do in any country , '' he said . 
  '' ** we are withholding medicines ** until they meet their obligations . '', 
  '' paying for the drugs herself , even in cases of emergency , is not a viable option for patients like karadona , who works in education in the public sector . 
  with her cancer treatment costing 2,500 euros a month -- but a gross monthly salary of just under half of that -- it is impossible for her to cover her medical bills . 
  `` my husband and i also have two children to support . 
  his business as a fishmonger has also dropped because of the financial crisis as people eat less fresh fish to save money . '', 
  ** in the center of athens , in one of a handful of state pharmacies , people are looking for prescription drugs that hospitals no longer have in stock . 
  ** '' here 's the link again : http://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/12/world/europe/greece-drugs-shortage/ read them in full please , else you 'll get the wrong idea . 
  `` parallel trading '' was a problem for people to buy medicine with their own money . 
  privately from the pharmacies . 
  the problem with the nhs and the medicines it provides to hospitals and people with chronic health problems is that the state ca n't pay the medicine firms so the firms do n't provide the medicine . 
  2 different problems that in the end make it impossible for many people to get their medicine . 
  there are many times reported deaths in the newspapers here as a consequence ( detailed with names of the deceased etc. ), 
  so rest assured it 's not ridiculous nonsense . 
  you have no moral obligation to help and i am not asking for any . 
  but please do n't be so easily judgmental for another nation . 
  we are in a difficult situation but we are not pathetic liars . 
  i wo n't reply to all this . 
  i do disagree with most ( not all of it ) . 
  a few things only : we have been living within our own means for years now . 
  please do not continue with that cliche . 
  the bail out loans never used to provide our economy/way of life/whatever . 
  they went straight to the debt . 
  they did n't reach greece even for a minute . 
  also since last august we received ** zero ** funds from the troika , still so far we have been able not only to live `` within our means '' but also to pay our debt obligations . 
  that is living within our own means . 
  i wish people would stop quoting that cliche cause it is not only wrong but also sounds like they sound snide . 
  as for what the troika tried to do : tried to `` propose balanced budgets '' etc. 
  just read this : `` instead of demanding repayment and further austerity , the imf should recognize its responsibility for the country 's predicament and forgive much of the debt . 
  greece 's onerous obligations to the imf , the european central bank and european governments can be traced back to april 2010 , ** when they made a fateful mistake ** . 
  instead of allowing greece to default on its insurmountable debts to private creditors , they chose to lend it the money to pay in full . 
  at the time , many called for immediately restructuring privately held debt , thus imposing losses on the banks and investors who had lent money to greece . 
  among them were several members of the imf 's board and karl otto pohl , a former president of the bundesbank and a key architect of the euro . 
  the imf and european authorities responded that restructuring would cause global financial mayhem . 
  ** as pohl candidly noted , that was merely a cover for bailing out german and french banks ** , which had been among the largest enablers of greek profligacy . 
  ultimately , the authorities ' approach merely replaced one problem with another : imf and official european loans were used to repay private creditors . 
  thus , despite a belated restructuring in 2012 , greece 's obligations remain unbearable -- only now they are owed almost entirely to official creditors . 
  five years after the crisis started , government debt has jumped from 130 percent of gross domestic product to almost 180 percent . 
  meanwhile , a deep economic slump and deflation have severely impaired the government 's ability to repay . '', 
  rest of the article : http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-04-21/imf-needs-to-correct-its-big-greek-bailout-mistake also take a look at that : '' ** in an internal document marked `` strictly confidential , '' the imf said it badly underestimated the damage that its prescriptions of austerity would do to greece 's economy ** , which has been mired in recession for the last six years . 
  ** the imf conceded that it bent its own rules to make greece 's burgeoning debt seem sustainable ** and that , in retrospect , the country failed on three of its four criteria to qualify for aid . '',
