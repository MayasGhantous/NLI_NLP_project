  ( just checking ), 
  i 'm sure you are n't !, 
  no snobby european is hungry !, 
  except maybe those from hungary ? 
  not really ... 
  it 's just an accident !, 
  it 's just that our archaeologists have trembling hands ( too much ouzo ) . 
  shhhhh shhhh shhhht !, 
  errr so much debt ? 
  easy : scientific research mostly . 
  we wanted to find the exact breaking point of porcelain !, 
  we do not smash plates . 
  he was being cynical !, 
  as it turns no one wants more immigrants . 
  and it is their right especially when they see how migrants from different cultures did n't integrate well in western europe . 
  so why doesnt someone dare to say the `` unthinkable '' . 
  just send them back and stop others from coming in . 
  i think so , yes !, 
  in any case the government has not people 's approval to exit euro . 
  that 's not news . 
  syriza untill very recently was a marginal party . 
  it houses some extreme leftists too . 
  the votes they got in the last elections are in no way representative on its true political followers . 
  many voted syriza cause of specific promises !, 
  one of the major ones was that we wouldnt abondon euro . 
  you are absolutely right my friend ... 
  they faced a living hell . 
  communtities that were there since antiquity almost completely wiped out . 
  many of them came back to greece during the 90s . 
  still some managed to hold on and still there is a greek minority there . 
  the glorious days !, 
   it just takes away a certain edge . 
  germans can not ( and in my opinion should not ) see their culture in only their great hours , but also in their darkest . 
  i think a culture of remembrance is a good thing and if it entails being hard on yourself - then so be it . 
  i fully agree on that my friend . 
  but as it happens now it is unjust to germans . 
  why ? 
  cause they are almost the only ones that do it . 
  let me clarify what i mean please . 
  this is something all nations should do . 
  face their darkest hours . 
  this documentary shows us that this didnt happen to others . 
  the red army was a tool in a man 's hands equaly evil to hitler : stalin . 
  the red army did many unacceptable crimes against humanity . 
  what do we see nowadays ? 
  celebrations for the red army that helped the world to get rid of a vile dictator ( hitler ) while being a vile tool under a vile dictator . 
  this is what i see as a great unbalance . 
  the german people had the ** decency and courage ** to see in the mirror it 's darkest hour and accepted their responsibility . 
  i would like to see others do the same . 
  russians , turks etc. . . 
  why this does not surprize me ? 
  latin alphabet too is a version of the greek one . 
  i mean that in my eyes , germans are absolutely no different to everyone else . 
  they are as innocent and good people as everyone else . 
  so they deserve to be recognized as such . 
  i do n't see the reason for them to feel as they have more of an obligation on the matter than anyone else . 
  sometimes , they are too hard on themselves about it . 
  the way you put it i agree . 
  but putting it that way , means that the collective guilt or more precisely the responsibility to never allow something like that to happen again , falls on all of us . 
  we all are equally responsible for that . 
  german people doesnt deserve to feel more responsible than anyone else . 
  not modern day germans . 
  it is wrong to feel that way . 
  collective guilt ( let alone punishment ) is unacceptable and very very wrong to impose on people . 
  hahaha do n't worry !, 
  such stupid things happen everywhere !, 
  i was n't serious mate !, 
  :d rest assured : it is your media being your media !, 
  no my friend , that can not be justified . 
  this is the behavior of beasts not humans . 
  even in war there are rules , let alone during peacetime . 
  it is a disgrace that people had to endure such monstrosities . 
  i am proud that nothing like that happened in my country even to 1 german soldier after germany surrendered . 
  it was very hard to watch this documentary . 
  what `` french '' fries ?!? 
  are n't they called [ freedom ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_fries ) fries ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exwfh6sgyso :d, 
  you are right . 
  regardless of political preferences , most people here think it 's better to default face the suffering and start anew , than this prolonged everyday death that has no signs to ever end . 
  as it is now there is no hope that this will ever stop . 
  people doesnt seem to understand this and think it is extortion etc. 
  far from it . . 
  *  party would be forced from office for doing so . 
   the only question now is what will happen when greece defaults on its debts ? 
  will market reactions force a grexit ( e.g. 
  with bank runs , etc ) ? 
  will the core euro nations blink in the face of a catastrophe and throw some more money at greece anyway just to kick the can down the road a little further ? 
  * first i need to clarify that i dont like syriza and havent voted for them . 
  but oversimpified post like this , brings me to the awkward position look like i am defending them cause there is some truth on what they say and do . 
  so i 'll leave this here for you or anyone that might be interested to find out that reality is far from * `` gives us you money or we 'll bring you down with us '' * blackmail you thing is happening . 
  thank you for your good advice sir !, 
  what you say is totally true but i am afraid its pointless . 
  just check `` yaix '' posts whenever there is a discussion about greece . 
  he 'll jump the opportunity to smug and say something bad . 
  even if it 's vague generalizations . 
  the dude must have some serious personal issues . 
  you mean * `` generally speaking '' * not something about ** this topic ** !, 
  just another opportunity to say something negative . 
  yes ? 
  also when the fcuk anyone said '' that everything was fine '' ?
