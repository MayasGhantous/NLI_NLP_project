  do you live in a parallel universe ? 
  greece did n't receive any money since last summer . 
  what do you mean that `` suddenly '' they need another bailout ? 
  also the negotiations between the greek government and its creditors are exactly about the debt and how it will be paid . 
  as for the `` concrete reform plans '' etc. , what exactly did they not deliver yet ? 
  how could they ? 
  since its what the negotiations are about . 
  so in your view they should 've already done them ? 
  before agreeing them with the creditors ? 
  continue your hateful mantra but be careful not to bite your tongue . 
  you 'll be severely poisoned . 
  what word are they not keeping ? 
  please elaborate . 
  do n't worry about him ... take a look at his posts whenever greece is the topic and you 'll understand . 
  he 's the great judge and jury . 
  ... says someone on his 1st and only post !, 
  what to you know about culture when you only wish to troll ? 
  ffs who said that they were intentionally wiped out ? 
  all that was needed was just a contact , nothing else . 
  when i spoke of `` biological warfare '' i was referring to what happened on the biological level . 
  i did n't mean that the spaniards or the portuguese did that on purpose . 
  of course they did n't !, 
  and they had nothing to gain from such a thing . 
  it was a figure of speech trying to point out that there was no slaughtering that wiped out the locals . 
  it was disease . 
  pah !, 
  i think you are wrong . 
  even now there are government imposed restrictions when it comes to contact isolated amazonian tribes so to protect them . 
  you see their immune system is very different ( due to isolation ) and lacking defenses against common diseases . 
  to understand how different the immune system of isolated groups are : all of european ancestry are the descendants of those who survived ( hence developed immunity ) the great plagues ( i.e. 
  black death ) . 
  that is not the case for the american indians or the australian aborigines . 
  in any case the numbers reveal what happened : 90 % of the native population died of diseases . 
  i hate to be the killjoy , but yes romans would definitely overrun the natives in the americas . 
  do n't forget that the main killer of the native population were the new diseases that europeans brought with them and to which the natives had no resistance . 
  90 % of the population was lost to diseases ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/population_history_of_indigenous_peoples_of_the_americas those poor people were in fact victims of biological warfare . 
  look who 's talking !, 
  hahahaha watched the video and what georgievski says about it ? 
  the world knows and you 're still in denial !, 
  pathetic !, 
  lugubrious laggards . 
  what is really pathetic here is you guys `` inventing '' history all over again so to grab an ethnic identity you do n't have . 
  until the end of the 19th century your people killed anyone among you who claimed to be `` macedonian '' . 
  no it 's not a fucking name , when your joke of a government invites some pakistani prince to the `` land of alexander '' to make a political farce . 
  it 's not `` just a name '' when you teach school children how the southern part ( aka north greece ) is not liberated yet . 
  it 's not just a name when you name airports etc in the name of alexander . 
  a name that has no meaning whatsoever in your bulgarian language . 
  but hey !, 
  you `` steal '' historical figures from the bulgarian history too . 
  you 've managed to become a joke of a country synonymous with fake . 
  what kind of mentality one must have to believe that they can enter an alliance when they are hostile to the members already in it . 
  pathetic !, 
  look what your ex-fyrom president ljubco georgievski says on macedonia ( he now enjoys a bulgarian passport and all ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f11fbwr59cq you have managed to alienate ( to say the least ) all your neighbors except serbia and you wonder why they do n't want you in their alliances !, 
  well done albanians !, 
  well done !, 
  you do realize that just because you chatted with someone with a greek flair , you throw cliches like : * `` so greece could just do that without even listening to the proposals . 
  in the end they are proposals from germany so they are probably made to enslave greece even more . 
  '' * those were totally uncalled for . 
  i hope that you do realize that such uncalled remarks are borderly racist insults . 
  i do n't mind about it , i 'm used to be called lazy greek , tax evading greek etc. 
  but you should know what your attitude is . 
  for sure subtlety is not your thing . 
  whenever a greek person says something you disagree , feel free to do the same and hit him with idiotic cliches . 
  oh spare me the world famous german humor , will you please ? 
  your ironies are even worse . 
  concentrate on how sure ( and why ) you are on how the french will go along !, 
  btw i am not greece , i am a person , so if you think that * `` greece could just do that without even listening to the proposals '' * is what greece should do mail it to the ministry of foreign affairs . 
  do n't tell it to me . 
  gosh !, 
  do you speak theoretically or based on the current news ? 
  if the latter then you missed this : http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-french-government-has-totally-ruled-out-any-eu-treaty-change-for-david-cameron-10262444.html so i guess after mr sch\u00e4uble finds some common ground with mr cameron , then he 'll try to ~ ~ bully ~ ~ convince the french and the rest eu members . 
  strange ... that seems quite like bilateral talks in the name of the whole eu . 
  you see he wants to talk about the `` treaties of the eu '' and not some vague `` own wish list '' . 
  i hope i am mistaken cause sometimes it would indeed be much better if they played pokemon . 
  from the above article : `` mr. sch\u00e4uble said he had invited his u.k. counterpart george osborne to berlin to discuss how to combine britain 's requests and germany 's own wish list of changes to the treaties of the eu , ** the bloc 's founding agreements that lay out how it operates ** . '', 
  so in other words mr sch\u00e4uble talks for the whole eu now ?!, 
  an he and mr cameron will * ** lay out how the eu operates ** * cause they are founding members ?!, 
  no one is seeing anything wrong with that ?!, 
  hahahahhaha, 
  it 's a recipe for a dish !, 
  i can understand it in the original text . 
  other texts - as fuchsiamatter said - like herodotus , are very easy . 
  edit : i perfectly understand that 172 letter word too :d, 
  latin are much further to italian than ancient greek to modern greek . 
  in fact the language the bible was written is very easily understood even by uneducated people . 
  true !, 
  172 letters . 
  shortest \u03c9\u03bd ( being ), 
  why should we think anything ( good or bad ) about it ? 
  anyone should do what he/she likes . 
  none of our business to pass judgment on it . 
  you passed the test with flying colors !, 
  you are nordic !, 
  there 's a true test to prove if you are nordic or not !, 
  are you super_uber cool to disco like this ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peqpwq1xgbi if `` yes '' , congrats !, 
  you are nordic !, 
  if not , then sorry , you must try harder !, 
  thank you austria for some of the greatest classical music thank you germany for some of the greatest classical music thank you italy for some of the greatest classical music thank you britain for the modern music thank you france cause part of me is french, 
  you should n't .
