  you mean people that oppose syriza policies and are against war reparations ? 
  also you say `` people like you will try to connect to a past ( 3 generations ago ) to excuse yourself from your mistakes of today . '', 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  and who the fuck are your people that * `` even after 70-200 years , my people still have to look at your people '' * wtf are you talking about ? 
  wan na know about my checks ? 
  i get 12/years and pension at 65 years . 
  wtf are you winning about ? 
  so according to you the wiki article you posted the 1st albanian book was written in 1555 . 
  ok . a few millennia after iliad and odyssey . 
  the other link you provided is pure nonsense . 
  the greek language is not only one of the richest in the word but has a continuity that is only seen in chinese . 
  in that link they deliberately use words with different meaning and from different time periods . 
  example : drys in greek is still called drys and it is the `` oak tree '' also the word is spelled drys in both homeric and modern greek . 
  with an upsilon ( = y in greek ) . 
  ksilo means wood in greek . 
  so the author in that link tries to show that homeric and modern greek differ by using the word `` oak '' and compare it to the word `` wood '' . 
  laughable nonsense that any linguist internationally would find completely moronic . 
  sadly , it doesnt seem the case . 
  it looks like he is an ultranationalist with illusions of grandeur !, 
  if you take a look at his posts on other threads you 'll see things like : `` greeks stole the design from the albanian flag '' `` good for our friends the turks !, 
  no more greek jets over the aegean ! '', 
  looks like a hateful loser who dreams of wars cause everyday life sucks . 
  can you show me where i said anything about ** bad ** german banks ? 
  also by your numbers the most debt was owned by greek banks ?!, 
  that 's a new one !, 
  how would you know ? 
  albanians did n't have any ~ ~ writting ~ ~ alphabet until [ 1908 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albanian_language ) !!!, 
  1908 ffs !, 
  hahahahhahaha, 
  hahaahahaha i bet so !, 
  to both of them . 
  syriza is coping with him out of necessity . 
  they could n't form a government without his party . 
  no one else wanted to give syriza a confidence vote . 
  still they are a minority government . 
  unfortunately !, 
  but what he says is far from truth . 
  not him nor syriza is greece 's means to guard the borders . 
  fuck him . 
  edit : why so much hate against us ? 
  i mean by you personally . 
  there is n't a single thread were greece is mentioned where you do n't get the chance to write as offensive as possible ? 
  honestly , why the hate ? 
  who holds the greek debt now ? 
  who hold it before the bail out ? 
  it 's easy to see what 's happening . 
  greece owed money mostly to german and french banks . 
  with the bail out greece took loans to pay these banks . 
  now the same debt is owed not by these banks but to the german and french governments ( i.e. 
  taxpayers ) . 
  in essence with the bail out the debt changed hands . 
  that 's what i am saying . 
  honestly it 's the 1st time ever i heard about a supposed eu policy that romanians and bulgarians speak the same language . 
  i do n't care where the word `` balkan '' comes from ( we call it haemus too ) , what matters is what it describes internationally . 
  it includes romania too . 
  ffs people kammenos is the head of a 4.75 % political party . 
  a proper clown who has his chance to be in the government because he gave syriza a vote of confidence . 
  do n't pay attention to him , he is an idiot . 
  nah i do n't think so ... 
  it 's just that nobody wants us anymore ... :d, 
  thank god we 're spared from that . 
  better alone . 
  no one wants us anyway . 
  for what is worth what i was taught is that romania is part of the balkans . 
  it makes sense too since romania is part of the peninsula . 
  here 's another map ( better source than wiki too ) http://media.web.britannica.com/eb-media/50/89850-004-c88e1b75.gif, 
  romania is not part of the balkans ? 
  did you hit your head or something ? 
  unite greece and turkey ? 
  that 's just impossible . 
  we are fine by ourselves thank you . 
  you would have if any illyrian words had survived . 
  modern albanian is a mixture of illyrian , italian , slavic , greek and turkish words . 
  which is quite understandable as you did n't even have writing ( an alphabet ) till the early 20th century . 
  hahahahaha occupied albanian cities ? 
  you 've got to be kidding !, 
  right ? 
  that 's a new one . 
  source please ? 
  we should n't compare roman empire - italy to 3rd reich - germany for the obvious reason : it took several hundreds of years for italy to emerge ( 1859 ) from the roman empire when it took 4 years ( 1945 to 1949 ) for 3rd reich to become germany . 
  in essence the same people who voted and fought for hitler and destroyed europe , where the citizens of germany . 
  do i need to say more ? 
  also in 1990 ** who ** told your parents and the rest german citizens that all obligations regarding wwii were done ? 
  maybe you should be angry with them for lying to you not us . 
  you will find that as i , many greeks are against those reparations . 
  we are against them out of ** good will ** . 
  because the atrocities were forgiven not forgotten . 
  but when for some years all we hear from german politicians and media is how `` lazy and corrupt '' greeks are and `` why should we care if they suffer , they should pay the debts now and they way we tell them too '' , then my friend i tell you in all honesty that you are making my view on the matter to look like stupidity . 
  how can you say that we suffered less losses than say france or uk ? 
  look it up and you 'll be surprized . 
  i do agree that you have nothing to do with the 3rd reich . 
  please to not compare this situation with the roman invasion though . 
  it doesnt do you justice . 
  is it judgemental to point out that loans are what 's given ? 
  germany = 1 , greece = 2 loans a ( 1 ) government gave to another ( 2 ) one so the debt that banks in country ( 1 ) will be paid by the government of the other country ( 2 ) ? 
  that not judgmental , that 's facts . 
  could they done it directly ? 
  does eu laws allow for governments to support private firms ( banks ) . 
  not to my knowledge . 
  where 's the blame game to that ?
