  greece defaulted back then . 
  it was kept afloat so the debt to be transfered from private banks to taxpayers money . 
  if greece didnt default then how come the economic crisis is more severe than that of the 30s ? 
  if all those loans given under such strict supervision were succesfull , then how come the debt went from 112 % to 178 % ? 
  they did ( italy ) . 
  search for it . 
  marshall plan was not a loan , yet you are calculating the interest ? 
  the `` allies '' as a term does include greece as many other countries . 
  have you read anything in between these two lines ? 
  i am explaining why we shouldnt use `` morality '' and `` ethics '' against each other . 
  i was * pointing out * ( that 's why the 2nd sentence ) that generalizations and use of one sided `` ethics '' ** provoke ** the other one to do the same . 
  have you seen the very next sentence ? 
  `` you see what happens ? 
  read it again and you might understand what i am saying . 
  i conclude by saying '' * so lets all shut the fuck up and work together for a change . * '' . 
  also , there is nothing to believe . 
  to forget about the past is my personal view on the matter . 
  but for that to work , we should all do the same . 
  you should stop the mantra `` immoral , undecent greeks who dont wan na pay their debts '' else you shouldnt complain if greeks do the same to you . 
  simple , isnt it ? 
  interesting document . 
  i fail to see any mention to greece or any greek signature in it . 
  instead it mentions `` four powers '' . 
  which of the 4 is greece ? 
  personally ** i am against those war reparations ** , cause in my mind we should forget the past and all european nations should embrace each other as brothers and build a better future . 
  that said , i must point a thing or two cause you seem to miss * that * point completely even thought you are reffering to it in some vague way . 
  - 1st of all you should stop reffering to decency in that onesided manner . 
  you reffer to my country as it failed in all accounts when it comes to decency and morality . 
  how very dare you ? 
  when does decency and morality starts for you ? 
  why not 40s ? 
  when was decency and morality when your country burned mine to the ground ? 
  you see what happens ? 
  when reffering to ethics about another nation you provoke them to bring back memories . 
  you provoke them to do the comparisons . 
  that is what 's happening since 2009 with german polititians and media . 
  they are reffering to us , as cons and lazy that we lack any morality . 
  we 've been even told to sell an island or ffs the acropolis . 
  so stop this hypocritical high morality attitude . 
  it will only backfire bringing comparisons . 
  there are still people alive today that suffered hell back then . 
  are you calling them moraly failed too ? 
  so shut the fuck up about moral issues get off your high horse and lets stop calling names each other . 
  lets work ** together ** . 
  - for what americans did with the marshal plan , we are deeply greatful to them . 
  let them tell us about the reasons and requests they had for it . 
  not you ffs . 
  you are playing it ethical with other nations ( us and british ) good actions . 
  - germany provided the bail outs only to save ** their ** irresponsible banks that lent money to our irresponsible goverments . 
  it takes two you see for that failure . 
  that * help * went directly to those banks and saved them from any consequences . 
  shouldnt they be criticized for their failure too ? 
  or do you thing they made an `` honest '' mistake giving away those money ? 
  dont let me start . 
  when the 1st bailout was given there was political pressure from the german and french governments for greece to buy tanks ( from germany ) and ships ( from france ) for example . 
  at the same time , they demanded to cut expenses to public helth etc. 
  as we speak when someone goes to a public hospital he/she must bring the drugs with him . 
  most hospitals cant provide them . 
  where 's the help and morality in that ? 
  - the bailout program and its terms did more damage than good . 
  it was a failure and even imf already said so . 
  so please please please stop this rhetoric . 
  it doesnt do any good . 
  not for you , nor for us . 
  i love germany and germans and i am truly sad will all this agressive rhetorics from both sides . 
  so lets all shut the fuck up and work together for a change .

  with syriza , i 'd bet there 'll be something new by then . 
  have you watched tonight 's news ? 
  that 's the government position now . 
  i am not a syriza fan myself but what you say is wrong . 
  in fact what the syriza government said to the greek public is : - if we reach an acceptable deal we 'll bring it to the parliament to be voted . 
  - if we think the deal is not good in terms of or our political views we 'll ask for a referendum or elections . 
  so no , most people are not dumb to go * `` yeah !, 
  standing up for the little man !, 
  for the love of cliches !, 
  happy easter !,
