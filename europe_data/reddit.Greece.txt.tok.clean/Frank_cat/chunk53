  not even one !!!, 
  i was so disappointed ... 
  comfort in your hate rhetoric . 
  you seem to always miss the point dude . 
  anyway , enough for me . 
  have a nice day . 
  what you believe is irrelevant . 
  reality has nothing to do with your preconceptions . 
  you can name it shit or whatever you wish , it still exists without your consent . 
  also it takes balls and dignity for one to admit his mistakes . 
  you lack them . 
  hence you 'll be `` convinced '' for ever . 
  you 've been weighed measured and found wanting . 
  so feel free to carry on with your superiority complex and blind hate . 
  i bet your everyday life sucks and you find comfort in all that . 
  all 'n all pretty pathetic . 
   can you guess ? 
  australia !, 
  sure but the op ? 
  but i do n't wine about anyone being misinformed . 
  it 's their problem . 
  i can point it to them whenever i wish . 
  they are the ones who are full of shit . 
  exactly like you . 
  you are full of shit , angry , agressive and have no clue whatsoever !, 
  most probably have a low iq too . 
  a proper ridicule . 
  pretty pathetic !, 
  [ this ] ( http://wallpapersinhq.com/images/big/beautiful_greece-992622.jpg ), 
  i fullheartedly agree with you !, 
  on the referendum you mention too . 
  i have to ask though ... how about the referendum papandreou announced back then ? 
  on if we should accept the bail out or default ? 
  what was sarkozy 's and merkel 's reactions ? 
  what happened to his government ? 
  and how on earth we had a change of government without elections ? 
  if my memory serves me well - it does - something similar happened to italy too . 
  hahahahhahaha again ?!, 
  why should i ? 
  when most people find comfort to be informed by media like bild and love to be aggressive ? 
  to easily point fingers and hate ? 
  should n't all try to be well informed ? 
  is n't it easy nowadays to dig deeper than the surface and not trust cliches like : greeks are lazy , greeks are tax evaders , greeks do nothing to fight corruption etc. 
  do you think that i should spend my days informing others ? 
  to keep arguing with people that already `` know '' ? 
  to keep explaining ? 
  no mate , i wo n't . 
  were there really two choices back then ? 
  what happened when papandreou announced a referendum on the matter ? 
  what 's so hard about it ? 
  nothing for me . 
  use google translate .

  it doesnt matter if you believe me or not . 
  i can give plenty of links about it but i do n't see the point . 
  your mind is already made about it . 
  also regardless of what you and me say , it seems that pretty soon events will unfold . 
  everyone will have to face the consequences . 
  more or less , just or unjust again it doesnt matter cause such is life . 
  after the dust will settle down , the truth will start to emerge . 
  then everyone will have to face the mirror and think hard . 
  plato . 
  you 'd be surprised on how many tax evaders were jailed the last years . 
  literally not a day goes by and there is n't some case on the newspapers . 
  that tax evasion mantra is blown out of proportion . 
  i am not a syriza voter myself but you should know a thing or two . 
  the last government did everything asked by the troika . 
  at some time troika upped it 's demands and postpone any loan release since last june . 
  that had a huge impact on that government . 
  they appeared to be doing everything asked and being ignored at the same time . 
  the situation felt as a constant struggle with no ending . 
  you can push people up to a point . 
  our european partners failed to see it and did n't give some breathing air to the last government . 
  did you think that syriza ( a 6 % political party just 4 years ago ) would take the government that easy ? 
  cause greeks are stupid ? 
  things are not as simple as you present them to be . 
  i very much agree with you !, 
  but is really so ? 
  have we full freedom how to reach their goals and face the consequences ? 
  what happened when papandreou wanted to have a referendum asking the people if they wanted the bail-out and the troika 's help ? 
  do you remember sarkozy 's and merkel 's reactions ? 
  what happened with the italian government too back then ? 
  can you remember ? 
  if not i 'm happy to give you some hints . 
  you are so well informed i salute you !, 
  you are so right when you scream `` they have done nothing ! '', 
  just do n't let the facts get in your way and continue : http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j1cucudxysu/vn-d3bua7xi/aaaaaaaabf4/rtwughqxuyg/s1600/oecd%2breform%2bchart.png, 
  you are banging on open doors here . 
  the idea that greece should get all those money as loans for the debt to be transferred from private bankings to taxpayers and call that help is what is absurd . 
  there was a huge failure from past greek governments , that is undeniable . 
  the private banks that gave those loans knew what they where doing . 
  their job is risk assessment . 
  have they done that ? 
  nope !, 
  all those bankers with huge wages and bonuses did their job ? 
  nope !, 
  they kept giving loans to corrupt governments . 
  there are both responsible for that . 
  they should both face the consequences . 
  what 's been done though is that greece took all the burden with new loans and a forced austerity so strong that the consequences were devastating .
