  did you click on the link ? 
  here what it says about sai list : ** russia 's top import partners below is a list of russia 's top 15 trade partners that imported the most russian shipments by dollar value during * 2014 * . 
  also shown is each import country 's percentage share of total exports from russia ** here the link again especially for you : http://www.worldstopexports.com/russias-top-import-partners/2338 also you say : `` unlinke greece '' . 
  any data to back this claim ? 
  so far it 's just talks for what i know . 
  are you that bigoted against greece ? 
  open your eyes and see the reality . 
  you are soooo right !, 
  those who trade with russia must be punished !, 
  especially those who import from russia and give them hot currency !, 
  so i 'll leave this list here to know where the punishment should begin : 1 . 
  netherlands : us$ 67,758,633,000 ( 13.8 % of total russian exports ) 2 . 
  china : $ 37,236,810,000 ( 7.6 % ) 3 . 
  germany : $ 36,815,710,000 ( 7.5 % ) 4 . 
  italy : $ 35,684,169,000 ( 7.3 % ) 5 . 
  turkey : $ 24,794,486,000 ( 5.0 % ) 6 . 
  japan : $ 19,742,765,000 ( 4.0 % ) 7 . 
  belarus : $ 19,252,156,000 ( 3.9 % ) 8 . 
  south korea : $ 17,678,837,000 ( 3.6 % ) 9 .

  finland : $ 11,319,625,000 ( 2.3 % ) 15 . 
  united states : $ 10,467,890,000 ( 2.1 % ) http://www.worldstopexports.com/russias-top-import-partners/2338 can be used as a hypocrites list too !, 
  why ? 
  the world looks b&w to you . 
  yes ? 
  it seems that greeks are so evil they are behind the nordstream too . 
  they 'd do anything to freeze the ukrainians . 
  why ? 
  the maximum time one can be detained without a formal accusation is 48 hours . 
  hahahhaha :d, 
  hahahha typical conversation in a finnish home during lunch : - lots of snow today !, 
  truly predictable !, 
  i think if they ( italy & greece ) cared enough , they would have many more sites . 
  shhh !, 
  shhhhh !, 
  shhhhh !, 
  awwww ... 
  it was a secret and now you blew it !, 
  with such wonderful history how could you not be stronk ? 
  drama queens . 
  first they do n't like their broomsticks . 
  now they do n't trust their rifles . 
  no my friend , i dont miss the point and i havent said that anyone here stygmatized the greeks . 
  that has already been done by politicians and the media !, 
  true !, 
  and good luck to them in succeding making lets say hochtief * ( managed athens airport for 20 years ) to pay hundreds of millions in vat that denied to ... or siemens ... * link in greek : http://www.newsbomb.gr/ellada/apokalypseis/story/421304/diegrapsan-500-ekat-fpa-poy-hrostoyse-i-germaniki-hochtief-stin-ellada, 
  '' tax evasion a poor system of tax inspections , aided by an opaque tax code , allows individuals and companies to bribe inspectors and evade taxes . '', 
  true !, 
  very true !, 
  the devil is in the details though . 
  companies and people able to do that are hardly the common ones ... hardly the majority and far from your everyday commoner . 
  that 's the reason they `` failed '' to adress the problem . 
  yet it is so often mentioned as a `` national sport '' or that the `` greeks do * this * and * that * ... '' that it 's getting ridicullous . 
  like the op `` greece shown the way ... '' how stupid this is !, 
  :p huh !, 
  as if they dont know the way ... 
  the fucking know it . . , the just dont want it to change cause it 's profitable and they can blame everyone for their shit . 
  i am not saying it isnt ( corruption * perception * ) . 
  i am simply pointing out the fact that nowadays greece * has * to be included in every story about corruption . 
  btw tax evasion too is overstated by the media . 
  it is not a national sport and is not as extended as people abroad believe , but that 's another matter . 
  whatever , wherever on the planer , anyone does on the matter should give greece a lesson ( even if there 's not as much corruption in greece ) !, 
  talking ` bout cliches ... :p, 
  say hi to baltic lake !, 
  hi baltic lake !, 
  but falklands are their country . 
  they surely matter to them . 
  how one earth can argentinians seriously claim falklands ? 
  because of proximity ? 
  before the brits settle there , no one lived on these islands . 
  and the brits never left them . 
  i say fcuk the argies for exporting their internal problems . 
  not the most stereotypical - cause he 's a semigod - but the bestest evah !, 
  [ ] ( http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2550104/thumbs/n-default-large570.jpg ) we win !, 
  good !, 
  let the farce end . 
  you 've got to dig a bit deeper : iraq crisis : how saudi arabia helped isis take over the north of the country, 
  on the other hand this policy is nothing sort of `` we are doing what idiots want to see '' . 
  or as if isis needs to be defeated ideologically . 
  just blow the bastards to pieces . 
  i mean isis is a threat to the west and we would have every right to wipe them out the most cruel way possible . 
  so others ( like boko haram ) would get a hint too . 
  i think the reason for not sending the bastards to hell has mostly to do with not annoying the good ole saudi arabia . 
  in other words , hypocrisy once again . 
  the same kind that wanted sandam hussein out of the picture . 
  as if we should give a shit on how he ruled iraq . 
  or libya . 
  or syria . 
  and now hundreds of thousands try to cross our borders and we have no fucking clue if among them are isis terrorists too . 
  no it should n't be a greek coin !, 
  we have the best euro evah !,

  if i had a saying , i would rather not having bild printing good things too about us . 
  bild : please stop it . 
  it feel worse having your `` love '' . 
  i stand corrected sir !,
