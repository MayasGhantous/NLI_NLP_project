  the european parliament is now on reddit ? 
  yaeee !, 
  source ? 
  in greece the top minority language is definitely albanian . 
  albanians are by far the largest immigrant group here . 
  maximum hypocrisy detected !, 
  the conservative government was preparing to ask for it , then syriza came to power . 
  also it 's not a new thing . 
  just google it to see how many times war reparations were asked . 
  actually greece ** never ** stopped asking them . 
  the goethe institute case though is another thing caused be 4 citizens . 
  finally it does n't matter if you are convinced or not . 
  the truth can be easily tracked nowadays . 
  just dig a bit harder and do n't fall for easy answers given by magazines or tabloids . 
  as i said before , personally i think they ( reparations ) should be forgotten/forgiven . 
  not an easy thing though when tabloids over there do n't miss a chance to criticize and ridicule us . 
  it has become an art for some to have `` the high morality ground '' stance and criticizing us so easily . 
  what better example than the one with the goethe institut ? 
  how idiotic people must be to even think that those 4 greeks who lost everything in distomo would agree in anyway whatsoever for their case to be used as a leverage by theirvery own government ? 
  how much of a lowlife one must be not to see the obvious that these people would be the first to ridicule the greek government if they used their pain as a leverage ? 
  one should only take a minute to see what they suffered and then graciously shut the fuck up . 
  fyi in distomo the nazis even put cloth pieces with petroleum in babies mouths and set them ablaze . 
  as some media picture us , it wo n't be a surprise if we end up paying for those reparations to the nazis ( bild would gladly use such a front page ) :p, 
  the reason is more simple than you think !, 
  no it is not to be used as a leverage . 
  syriza were ** always ** demanding for reparations . 
  years before they had any chance to become a government . 
  they used to call the then governments `` traitors '' for not asking them . 
  it was certain that they would ask for them . 
  a high figure in syriza is the very guy who took the nazi flag down from the acropolis during the occupation ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manolis_glezos ) in fact greece asked for reparations many times but was always turned away . 
  greece simply did not have the leverage to achieve anything about it . 
  syriza on the other hand is a very different party than those who ruled greece in the past . 
  they will not back down . 
  crisis or not they will ( and would anyway ) insist on them . 
  fyi i am not a syriza voter myself . 
  mind the dates !, 
  court ruling was on 1997 . 
  after long procedures ( in which goethe-institut took active part ) the high court gave its final decision in 2000 . 
  to connect a 3 year long procedure with the ez entry is similar with conspiracy theories like hollow earth etc. 
  pure nonsense for the masses . 
  read again the wiki to see what really happened . 
  4 relatives of victims took their case to the court . 
  the court decided in their favor . 
  the government did not give its consent so the judgement to be executed . 
  it was not the greek state that took the case to the courts . 
  it was the greek state that stopped it . 
  the rest is nonsense . 
  you are right to call it shit . 
  what happened in 2000 is that 4 persons from distomo went to the courts so to get reparations . 
  that had nothing to do with the government . 
  here 's the wiki article : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/distomo_massacre '' four relatives of victims brought legal proceedings against the german government to court in livadeia , greece , demanding reparations . 
  on october 30 , 1997 , the court ruled in favour of the plaintiffs and awarded damages of 28 million euros . 
  eventually in may 2000 , the areopag , the greek high court , confirmed this ruling . 
  the judgment , however , could not be enforced in greece because , as necessary under greek law , the execution of a judgment against a sovereign state is subject to the prior consent of the minister of justice , which was not given . '', 
  so yeah it 's absolutely shitty article from the spiegel , that mislead people like you to believe that greeks are not only lazy fucks but also bullies . 
   * this is not the first time greece threatens germany with demanding reparations . 
  greece forced itself into the eurozone by e.g. 
  threatening germany with demanding reparations . 
  they also cooked the books to some negligible degree . 
  the point i am trying to make is that germany did not convince greece to join . 
  the greeks wanted to . 
  * what a curious post !!!!, 
  `` greece threatened germany with demanding reparations so to force itself into the eurozone '' ??? 
  every single day i hear something new !, 
  a few points : - yes it 's true the government of greece cooked the books to some extend . 
  and it not only without `` greece '' ( = the people ) knowing it , but also if they didnt do that , then greece would properly enter the ez just a few months later . 
  the `` cooking '' it seems to be know to the rest of the ez governments as it was done by other countries but also they thought the more countries the more prestige the new currency would have . 
  - to ask for reparations is not a threat . 
  one either entitles them , or not . 
  simple as that . 
  yes greece asked for them , many times in the past and was always been shown the door . 
  but `` threaten '' with them is far fetched . 
  greece always was weaker than germany to be able to threat her . 
  my personal opinion on the matter ? 
  to forget the reparations all together . 
  also germany should stop claiming the high ground on every occasion and call whole nations as lazy , frauds etc. 
  a `` union '' can not be that way . 
  - devaluing the currency of an export-focused economy should be yummy but as we all know , germany always wanted a very strong euro . 
  that is a fact and common knowledge . 
  - austerity getting rid of the bubbles ? 
  i think it 's the other way around . 
  bubbles make a crisis and austerity does not help economies to kickstart again . 
  proof ? 
  usa a great bubble led to a crisis but managed to kickstart their economy exactly because they did n't use austerity . 
  hahahaha !, 
  i honestly love germany and it 's people !, 
  some of my best frends ( i regard them as family actually ) are germans !, 
  what a cuntish comment on kant ... 
  you know what my friend ? 
  germany + greece = friends media + politicians everywhere deserve the finger !, 
  lots of love to germany too !, 
  who cares ? 
  mr b\u00f6hmermann gives the finger to all who easily jump to hate speech on both sides of the fence . 
  both germans and greeks . 
  yes sir !, 
  manfllu is worse than death !, 
  it certainly is . 
  same happens everywhere . 
  here too , there might be 100.000 peaceful protesters but the media will always show 50-70 who are violent . 
  yeah , but burning the building down wont change anything for the better .
