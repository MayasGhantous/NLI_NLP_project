  why do they care if ecb has new offices ? 
  '' i bet there are some welshmen that will give the sheep a ** loving ** home '' there !, 
  fixed it for you !, 
  * a wealthy and respected country * so others were attacked because they were poor and lacked respect ? 
  rong \u00ae on so many levels ... 
  because you are part of the european family . 
  that 's why !, 
  and i see no chance in hell that russia would attack finland for that very reason . 
  damn !, 
  they know their propaganda well !, 
  hint : commerce, 
  nice !, 
  of course it 's fake !, 
  and true !, 
  ffs people !, 
  he 's varoufakis the son of zeus , half man-half souvlaki !, 
  he can bent time-space continuum . 
  he can chose from an infinite parallel universes . 
  germany did that years ago ? 
  i 'll leave this here : http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-17/swiss-tax-deal-seen-buried-after-prominent-german-cases-revealed hint : the minute the swiss agree to transparency and taxation on such funds they 'll lose their banking paradise status . 
  have you not considered that the article is far from the truth and just a bait to sell ? 
  here 's an article from 2014 ( february the 5th ) which mentions that there were talks between the 2 sides and after 4 years and the swiss said '' '' * models have been developed in the past for untaxed money in swiss banks , appear obsolete . 
  we need to move in another direction and it will do * '' . 
  in other words : forget it . 
  the germans failed too . 
  so it would be a good idea to try and be informed before chosing the easy path to point how the * greeks * dont even go to collect free money . 
  beats me !, 
  explosive diarrhea maybe ? 
  yeah , i know !, 
  so everything can be expected . 
  russian president vladimir putin , who has not been seen in public since march 5 and is feared in some panicky circles to have died or worse , has the flu , a cia source tells gawker . 
  or at least that 's what the cia thinks . 
  russia 's entry to eurovision song kont3ct maybe ? 
  relax mate !, 
  we are ( i for sure am ) only joking . 
  greece wo n't be an obstacle as it was n't when albania wanted to join nato . 
  albania has greece 's support on this . 
  `` any resemblance to real persons , living or dead , is purely coincidental '' :d, 
  and when albania becomes an eu member then the portuguese will blame albania that they werent ready . 
  ronaldo is that you ? 
  so where do you come from ? 
  lets put you on your own test then to see what 's your collective guilt on matters you probably had no power to change . 
  `` the * greeks * are very infantile '' . 
  seriously ? 
  so the actions of a minority government , is characterizing a whole nation ? 
  a political party that found themselves in power just because of desperation people is in ? 
  fyi syriza was a 6 % party just 3 years ago and now about 36 % voted for them ( but are n't true followers ), 
  btw congratulations canada on preserving your national igloo !, 
  naaaah i love germany . 
  i have many friends there i would n't be so cruel to them !, 
  hahahahha how cool is that !, 
  a whole greece without syriza would be much better . 
  although it wont be long it feels like an eternity ... 
  worst case scenario is fewer votes on eurovision . 
  not all of us are behind that stupidity ... 
  i too agree !, 
  sorry guys for that stupidity ... 
  - i was shocked not to find any kangaroos in austria . 
  kangaroos is a damn lie i tell you . 
  dont fall for it they dont exist !, 
  - i was shocked not to find any vikings in denmark . 
  where do they go to rest after a hard day 's pillaging ? 
  - no spaggeti fields in italy !, 
  seriously ... - no attila hoards in hungary . 
  also no one seemed hungry . 
  not at all !, 
  - no cocoa trees in switzerland !, 
  i bet they import the chocolate and then lie about it and sell it as if they made it . 
  nope !, 
  \u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b6\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 is the old type ( 2 vertical pieces http://www.multimonosis.gr/\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b6\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1/ ) that one 's called \u03c1\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac . 
   those in greece too they are commonplace . 
  they are called `` rolla '', 
  absolutely this !, 
  i agree !, 
  our politicians must sit down and find solutions . 
  i do n't think they have it as a high priority issue at the moment . 
  not as much as they should . 
  the 1st one should be the countries of origin to accept those who are to be deported . 
  it is ridiculous pakistan not accepting pakistani citizens back . 
  other countries too . 
  i think if we all together put pressure on those countries we will achieve a lot . 
  the solution is preventing most of them on the borders . 
  and take actions for their countries to take them back . 
  also put pressure to countries like turkey who happily let them through . 
  btw you are mixing `` asylum applicants '' with `` illegal immigrants '' . 
  they are not the same and their numbers differ too . 
  surely sweden has more asylum applicants than greece but waaaay less illegal immigrants that greece or italy . 
  have n't said that you do n't share the burden . 
  what i say is that you could help more . 
  south european countries need help to check all those borders ( the whole mediterranean actually ) . 
  the costs are huge for them to deal with it alone . 
  another problem also is with those who are to be send back to their countries . 
  very often their countries ( is pakistan ) put obstacles and refuse to accept them back . 
  that too should be solved with a common foreign policy action . 
  there are other ways for them to reach central europe , through bulgaria and serbia for example . 
  greece tries its best but we have a very long borderline and not much resources . 
  greece very often asked for a common border control . 
  frontex just is n't enough . 
  not really . 
  we stop them from traveling to other eu states .
