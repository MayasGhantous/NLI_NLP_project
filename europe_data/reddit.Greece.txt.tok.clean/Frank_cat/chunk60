  much delay occurs because their countries take every measure not to take them back . 
  oh yes sir !, 
  people will absolutely go apeshit with this . 
  only because they seemed to give a fight for the economy . 
  trust me , if they pull something like this for the immigrants they wo n't know when they 'll be out of government . 
  absolutely !, 
  syriza will be pushing its luck . 
  they are a minority government too . 
  i dont think ( and hope ) this will happen . 
  they 'll have a revolt if they do . 
  for the mess your country 's in . 
  ie the * p * in piigs, 
  true that !, 
  :p that 's the reason for our hardships too . 
  so what 's your excuse ? 
  i see what you are saying but democracy should be the goal for the benefit of the turkish society/citizen not for the sake of eu . 
  i ca n't imagine how the secular , progress loving , well educated turks must feel under such government . 
  stay strong and do n't despair my friends !, 
  sooner or later that government will go away and things will get better . 
  why is this shocking ? 
  that mail is n't more hateful than what 's been shown on the 1st pages of tabloids and newspapers in germany . 
  again and again . 
  and because of those hateful messages they sell even better . 
  it 's not the fault of the common german . 
  it 's the fault of bad journalism and political rhetorics . 
  in fact the german public showed a lot of maturity considering what they are told . 
  and this is not happening only in germany . 
  i am afraid it will take a long time to be unbranded from the `` lazy , corrupt and greedy greeks '' tag . 
  well it would never cross my mind that putin does n't like nato and wants it destroyed . 
  thanks commander obvious !, 
  that 's what bail outs are for matey !, 
  only do n't tell that to ~ ~ troika ~ ~ the trio ( what 's the name for it nowadays ? ), 
  yet !, 
  we 'll just send varoufakis , he 'll annoy everyone to death and they will agree !, 
  problem solved !, 
  how could he not be ? 
  he 's half man half souvlaki you know !, 
  that 's why he 's yummy too !, 
  well at first we thought it was too much to send varoufakis ( son of zeus ) to eurovision ... 
  he is going to win all the nobel prices too so we felt it was a bit unfair for the rest of humanity but ... yeah ... why not ? 
  it 's ok mate !, 
  no hard feelings !, 
  actually we have a second plan !, 
  vote us or we send him to sing : [ ] ( http://www.athensmagazine.gr/photos/articles/thumbs_large/6a6820899894d3257f9adcdb87740d5b.jpg ), 
  shhhhhhhh shhhhhh awwwww you 've ruined our chances to win !, 
  are you happy now ? 
  are you ? 
  what 's wrong with the stereotypical italian image ? 
  i find it excellent !, 
  the romantization of the eastern roman empire didnt just happen with no reason . 
  in all this region , all peoples living in it have folk songs , stories etc that are hundrends of years old . 
  not because of some political intervention or anything . 
  just because they have a good memory of it . 
  romanians even chose their name from it . 
  this ** is ** a historical fact . 
  and it is very much alive even nowadays . 
  huh !, 
  we are 17th and have no song yet !, 
  due to economic hardship we wont even send a song in the contest . 
  just a simple message : vote us or ... http://tvxs.gr/sites/default/files/imagecache/node_image/article/2010/28/40365-dog-gun.jpg, 
  well 2 hundrend years have already passed for my country and i can witness no `` idolizing '' happen . 
  somehow the peoples in the region wont idolize it ( as with byzantium ) not even in a 1000 years . 
  you see when was byzantium ( ** roman empire ** actually , byzantium is a new and western term ) here , it was synonymous with `` civilized '' . 
  on the contrary , i can assure you that for the nations in the region the ottoman empire is synonymous to barbarism . 
  well in regard to the region we are talking about ie the balkans that 's what we faced , that 's what we loathe . 
  me neither , but i feel i should welcome you to the club bro !, 
  unfortunately ... edit : just to add that i dearly hope that it means nothing remotely similar to what we are going through . 
  best wishes to you all . 
  in any case heretics had no better chance in the western roman empire . 
  in fact heretics are still treated badly even today . 
  see what 's happening with sunis and shias even today . 
  anyway in the region we are talking about ( ie bulgaria and balkans ) byzantium is remembered fondly . 
  the ottoman empire is remembered as the darkest period in history . 
  that is not a subject for debate , it 's a fact . 
  yet in all the european lands of the byzantium empire , people remember it fondly even after all these years . 
  ask romanians , serbs , bulgarians , greeks to see . 
  it 's like sharing a bond . 
  on the other hand all of them nations have the worst ( collective ) memories about the ottoman empire . 
  for christians it was n't a matter of choice . 
  and nope !, 
  taking your child away , at a very young age is n't something you would like . 
  well i am not saying that islam is evil but in * that * empire non muslims had to pay more taxes . 
  in blood too : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dev\u015firme so nope !, 
  not all empires were the same . 
  we 've got you covered !, 
  we are the impenetrable to psychoanalysis in the general area !, 
  icelanders : they are ponys !!!, 
  hahahahaha one of the best i read on these maps !, 
  still , people lived . 
  oh well ... one side was definitely better . 
  and that is a fact . 
  hint : it was n't the communists . 
  had them took the power there would n't be imprisonments on aegean islands . 
  they 'd be mass graves . 
  we had the us support . 
  fucking communists . 
  yes . 
  still a civil war lasted years . 
  answer to poles : greece was n't part of the eastern block cause we fought about it . 
  we even had a very nasty civil war that lasted years .
