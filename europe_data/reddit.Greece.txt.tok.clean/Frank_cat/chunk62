  we have excellent relations with albania and bulgaria . 
  on the other hand fyrom has n't the best of relation with greece , albania or bulgaria . 
  you see they are stealing from all of the neighbors . 
  so if you wan na call someone `` petty '' call them that . 
  petty thieves are even better . 
  exactly !, 
  sadly it is true . 
  i do n't think you need to go into conspiracy theories mate . 
  it 's the oldest trick in the book . 
  some of your politicians in order to get and control power they make a myth and the need a bad guy . 
  just look at this : http://www.independent.mk/articles/9552/antonio+milososki+raises+vergina+sun+flag+on+mount+olympus,+touches+a+nerve+of+greece#sthash.8nrkcsae.dpuf read the article and then the comments . 
  you 'll get the picture . 
  well it 's not that we are stubborn and `` butthurt '' as many describe us . 
  mostly , it is not about the name . 
  they constantly lie about the whole thing . 
  on one hand they say `` we use the name cause we live in the area '' and on the other `` we are the offspring of alexander the great '' . 
  years ago , at the start of it all greece proposed that `` north macedonia '' would be acceptable . 
  they declined it . 
  why ? 
  because they are trying to alter history : presenting the ancient macedonians as non greeks ( contrary to every respectful historian ) . 
  they occupy none of the area of the ancient kingdom , and only 25 % of the roman administrative region . 
  100 % of the ancient kingdom is in greek territory and more than 70 % of the roman region . 
  they speak a bulgarian dialect , have nothing to do with the customs and traditions too . 
  they make territorial claims . 
  they also steal from the bulgarian history too . 
  until the late 19th century they were killing anyone that claimed to be macedonian cause that would mean greek . 
  it 's after tito 's politics they started to be interested in `` macedonian '' identity . 
  you see now why this is very sensitive to us . 
  we are defending it from liars and thieves . 
  and they can lie all the want , but they should n't whine about the consequences then . 
  also megali idea doesnt exist since 1922 . 
  why greece is not right ? 
  perhaps you should be informed about the situation before you make such a comment . 
   none of the concessions we 've made so far have worked . 
  we changed our flag , our constitution and accepted the `` temporary reference '' former yugoslav republic of macedonia . 
  cause there really was n't any change . 
  the provocations about altering history and creating a new false one , is still happening . 
  also provocations like people parading with signs that thessaloniki will be `` macedonian '' etc. 
  have you ever seen a march were greeks would hold signs like `` skopje will be greek '' etc ? 
  how do you think all this feels over here ? 
  or do you think we are blind ? 
  does this look like trustworthy to you ? 
  or a provocation ? 
  do you really changed your flag ? 
  milososki told vest daily that the flag he displayed was a `` historic macedonian symbol . '' http://www.independent.mk/media/photos_more/201409/path_816.jpg `` i always carried the flag with the 16-pointed macedonian sun with me . 
  another member of the climbing group had the state flag with them . 
  so we raised both flags at the peak of mount olympus and we took photographs with great satisfaction , '' said milososki .

  it says about the vergina sun . 
  claiming ancient greek ancestry ? 
  really ? 
  i am sorry but you are the ones that are not trustworthy . 
  and yes , until you learn to really cooperate you can forget both eu and nato . 
  greece had proposed in the past that `` north macedonia '' was an acceptable name . 
  it 's your government that denied it . 
  why ? 
  cause they do n't want to give up the ancient ancestry . 
  so yeah they can tell all the lies they want but then do n't whine about the consequences . 
  as for eu and nato , you should know that greece actively helped albania to become a nato member and bulgaria to become a nato and an eu member . 
  no strings attached , just good honest cooperation . 
  the fact that it 's your country that has problems should really puzzle you about your politician 's intentions . 
  they just play the nationalistic game to control you . 
  for that , they need a myth and a bad guy . 
  it 's a pity cause greece is really your natural ally in the region . 
  you should see it . 
  as the situation is now , you 've lost it . 
  but but ... saudi arabia very stronk in human rights . 
  saudi arabia 's got a seat in un human rights council . 
  exactly !, 
  and while many so easily question italy 's morality in this matter they dont question their own morality on other matters . 
  like with the refugees . 
  then each one does whatever feels right to him and whine that eu ca n't tell them what to do etc. 
  hypocrites of the highest order . 
  and what 's that 've got to do with the name dispute and their efforts to change history ? 
  as for the yugoslav wars : a ) fyrom never was involved in them b ) greece never took the serbian side . 
  we only opposed the bombings on serbia but we certainly made it easy for nato to operate there by giving them access through thessaloniki etc. 
  so what the hell are you talking about . 
  yeah that they steal from everyone . 
  ... and claim they are the true romans etc. 
  so why this : http://arxidamos.pa-sy-a.gr/2010/01/01/00-00/skopjans_propaganda_for_new_macedonia.jpg or this : http://www.iefimerida.gr/sites/default/files/styles/708x320/public/skopia708.jpg?itok=14jqtt-z, 
  care to give us a source about that ? 
   therefore the people who live in the historical region of macedonia are macedonians fyi they claim to be on the area of the kingdom of macedon , not the historical ( i.e. 
  roman ) region of macedonia . 
  hence the kitschy statues of alexander the great on a flying saucer etc : http://cdn3.spiegel.de/images/image-557202-galleryv9-gzxh-557202.jpg so no !, 
  when the claim they use the name `` macedonia '' because of historical roots to alexander etc they do n't have the right . 
  got it now ? 
  edit : here 's what the region they live in was named at the time of alexander : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paeonia_ ( kingdom ), 
  you are right !, 
  no real relation between this case and macedonia . 
  after all south east turkey is part of kurdistan while the former yugoslav republic of macedonia is on the land that was named paeonia . 
  unfortunately people that agree with your opinion are a minority over there . 
  i can assure you , no greek would have a problem with your country to be named macedonia if the ultra nationalistic falsifying of history did n't happen . 
  unfortunately all this narrative about roots to alexander 's macedonia etc happened at the same time your country got its independence . 
  blame it on your politicians that played this game to gain power and control the people there . 
  as for what happened in the 20s and 40s read about how many greek villages were slaughtered . 
  try to see on the other side of the fence to get the whole picture . 
  it 's a shame because i honestly think you 've lost one of your natural allies in the region ( greece ) . 
  gave up already ? 
  thank you !, 
  it would be a socking surprise if turkey had any other stance of the matter .
