  perhaps we should refer to south east turkey as kurdistan . 
  we will never accept it cause it 's not about the name . 
  do n't you see it ? 
  they are creating a falsified history . 
  they are claiming our heritage as theirs . 
  look what their ex-prime minister says about the matter : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fklkmw_au5i perhaps you ca n't understand what it means for us cause your nation doesnt have any truly historical memory . 
  any history whatsoever by comparison . 
  we on the other hand speak nowadays a language that is about 100 % the same as the one the bible was written . 
  yes !, 
  it remained the same for 2000 years . 
  so be informed before you form a view on the matter . 
  pah !, 
  it 's not about a fucking name . 
  i guess it 's not easy for you to grasp . 
  look at this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fklkmw_au5i, 
  funny how easily you say `` they took the languages '' as this is something easily done . 
  on the other hand some people did n't lose their language - in fact they have it virtually the same since hellenistic times - yet everyone is the same and all have the same rights in historical context . 
  sure you have history . 
  not the one some people in your country try to make you believe though . 
  you are a slavic people , speaking a slavic language very close to bulgarian and until the late 19th century your own people would kill any of you that claimed to be `` macedonian '' . 
  can you get bothered with the fact that they alter your history too ? 
  half of your national historical figures , they claim they are `` macedonians '' . 
  no , what is retarded is that they try to build a nation on propaganda , falsifying history and ultranationalism . 
  they do n't pretend they are the only americans though . 
  what you miss is the constant effort they do to falsify history . 
  they do it with greek history , they do it with the bulgarian history too . 
  it 's not only about `` a '' name . 
  thank you !, 
  and we should call finland something like `` russia 's next province '' or `` ex russian , next russian province '' :d now you too have a stupid name that you do n't want . 
  well something `` plastic '' ( faux ) is appropriate for them . 
  you think so ? 
  that it 's only about butthurt ? 
  and you state that as a fact ? 
  gosh !, 
  well check it out . 
  you 'll find out that the french agreed for uk to be a member of the eu only if they did n't use `` britain '' in their name . 
  yes , it was because of bretagne . 
  too late !, 
  guess why uk became an eu member under the name united kingdom , and not great britain or britain . 
  go ahead check it out !, 
  are you serious ? 
  blaming this on merkel is one of the dumbest things . 
  as if there were n't illegal crossing before merkel said anything . 
  if one 's to blame this is the turkish government that uses that people to push their own agenda . 
  i think you 've missed the news . 
  they literally beg them to get on the busses to relocated them in camps around the country . 
  they refuse to do so , on the hope that the borders will open again . 
  exactly !, 
  a manipulative dictator of the shittiest order . 
  hence everything he build did n't last after his death . 
  yeah yeah right . 
  you should get your shit together dude . 
  it 's ridiculous what your nationalistic governments are trying to do . 
  do you believe their shit ? 
  only at the southern part of your country as it seems . 
  some almost right on the borders . 
  and all of them are mentioned as greek ones ... hmmm interesting . 
  is there anything ancient , around your capital skopje ? 
  i mean something ancient that dates before the 1990s . 
  lol do you even read what they write about them ? 
  bilota is one of the oldest cities on the territory of the republic of macedonia , having been founded as ** heraclea lyncestis ** in the middle of the 4th century bc by philip ii of macedon . 
  heracles lyncestis also spelled herakleia lynkestis ( greek : \u1f29\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u039b\u03c5\u03b3\u03ba\u03b7\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03c2 ; macedonian : \u0425\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0435\u0430 \u041b\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0441 ; latin : heraclea lyncestis ) , was an ancient greek city [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] perhaps hercules ( the city was named after him : heraclea ) was a slav too ? 
  the earliest inhabitants of the widest lake ohrid region were the dassaretae , an ancient greek tribe [ 11 ] [ 12 ] and the enchelei , an illyrian tribe . 
  [ 13 ] during the roman conquests , towards the end of 3rd and the beginning of 2nd century bc , the dassaretae ** and the region dassaretia ** were mentioned , as well as the ancient greek city of lychnidos ( greek : \u039b\u03c5\u03c7\u03bd\u03b9\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2 ) . 
  [ 15 ] the existence of the ancient greek city of lychnidos is linked to the greek myth of the phoenician prince cadmus who , banished from thebes , in boeotia , fled to the enchelei [ 16 ] and founded the town of lychnidos on the shores of the modern lake ohrid . 
  [ 17 ] i wo n't go on ... 
  do n't know of any such reports . 
  so how many ancient macedonian cities exists in fyrom ? 
  lol phillip the ii conquered many lands . 
  did n't change their names into `` macedonia '' . 
  you do n't know what you are talking about . 
  read some history 1st . 
  you 'll be amazed to find out that during phillips and alexander 's time , that region was not called macedonia . 
  perhaps he is implying that the language we speak nowadays is the same that was spoken in hellenistic times . 
  lol, 
  we do n't hate each other mate . 
  we are fine with albanians !, 
  lol do you even know what are you talking about ? 
  do you even know why they built all those kitschy statues ? 
  do you even know that they are using the name to alter history ? 
  can you be so naive ? 
  but do n't listen to me . 
  listen to the former prime minister of fyrom , ljub\u010do georgievski : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fklkmw_au5i, 
  i know mate but what they are doing is hilariously stupid . 
  they try to falsify a well documented history . 
  they 'd have a better chance claiming they were the real `` kardashians '' lol, 
  lol you are so pathetic !, 
  being slavs doesnt give them the right to falsify history . 
  it 's not only about the name  they also deserve to join both the eu and schengen . 
  by what criteria ? 
  for building a fence ? 
  lol, 
  you tell them that neighbor . 
  you and us are the oldest inhabitants in the area . 
  all others came many centuries later . 
  so what 's the need for the false history ? 
  the false kitschy reconstruction ? 
  that land btw was not called macedonia in ancient times . 
  certainly not during alexander 's rein . 
  why all the propaganda then ?
