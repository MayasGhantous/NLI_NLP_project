  no it 's not about conquering any part of our country . 
  it 's about creating another , a false reality . 
  it 's not about only * a name * and you pretty well know it . 
  so again , why all these fake statues ? 
  why all this fake `` history science '' if it 's only about the name . 
  your own nationals would kill anyone that claimed to be macedonian until the 19th century . 
  why all this nonsense propaganda now ? 
  you are very ignorant if you think it 's only about a name . 
  there are trying to falsify history . 
  look what the former prime minister of fyrom , ljub\u010do georgievski says and how the journalist reacts claiming `` top scientists '' say otherwise . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fklkmw_au5i it 's about rewriting history in a false and ultra nationalistic way . 
  the journalist even claims that the northern greek province was n't named macedonia till 1990 !, 
  that is a lie so laughable one would be a complete moron to say it . 
  just check out maps before 1990 . 
  so please if you do n't know something , ask about it . 
  else you will say nonsense . 
  i certainly do n't wan na start a fire . 
  i hope you also do n't want to . 
  you know some facts : a ) it 's not only about the name b ) you can hardly accuse some internet hot headed users when your own governments blinded with ultranationalistic dreams behave like trolls . 
  that 's what i 'm saying . 
  well you do n't wan na start that dude . 
  just google kitch capital of europe and see . 
  :p [ here 's alexander on a flying saucer or something ! ], 
  ( http://cdn3.spiegel.de/images/image-557202-galleryv9-gzxh-557202.jpg ) the worst part is that it 's not done by some mindless net user but from the government !, 
  so yeah it 's not about a name . 
  it 's about stealing other nations history . 
  and you 've done it with almost all your neighbors : bulgarians , albanians , greeks . 
  terrible !, 
  my deepest condolences . 
   erdo\u011fan put turkey on an irreversible course and the worst is yet to come . 
  i hope it is n't the case . 
  keep the hope . 
  we also have [ griko ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/griko_dialect ) they are dialects though not separate languages . 
  sure mate !, 
  why not ? 
  it is simple as that : ** he doesnt have the right to say whats proper and what 's wrong for women ** . 
  in fact he doesnt have the right to say such a thing about anyone . 
  all people have the same rights and they decide for themselves what right and wrong . 
  it 's strange that people do n't see through that . 
  why the hell is it wrong for a woman to do manual labor ? 
  what if she wants to do manual labor ? 
  it 's wrong to make anyone - woman or man - to do manual labor . 
  `` to make '' is to force it upon them . 
  what if that is their only means of survival though ? 
  what if it 's what a woman prefers/likes to do ? 
  would it still be wrong ? 
  it is their own damn choice what is right for them . 
  on individual level . 
  and who the hell does he think he is , making such generalizations that cover half of humanity ( women ) ? 
  no , it 's not taken out of context mate !, 
  it is the heart of the matter . 
  how can you not see it guys ? 
  i would n't know !, 
  it does seem though that women have fewer rights in certain societies . 
  what is disguised as `` different '' rights is actually oppression as no one can `` weight '' rights in equal measure . 
  also who is to decide which rights are proper for men and which rights are proper for women . 
  who is to judge this ? 
  * the whole notion is just sick . 
  as far as mr & misses erdogan ... it looks like an oxymoron one to say that not all `` roles '' are proper for women ( actually says stay home with the kids ) and the other one to call women to take more `` roles '' in society . 
  one of them is a hypocrite it seems . 
  so if i may ask you ... how can you not see that ? 
  * and do n't wan na go to sharia where women inherit half of what men do or that women are not considered as much liable witnesses as men do etc. 
  greek language .

   `` we should be creating a just community by spreading values of social equality . 
  we should be opening positions to our women in all fields from politics to academics and business to arts . '', 
  did she ask her husband about this ? 
  i dearly hope you wo n't go greek . 
  i 'd be very sorry to see the finnish people suffer as much . 
  you 've got my best wishes that everything will go well . 
  thank you !, 
  i do n't understand . 
  why the government reacts that way ? 
  how dare they ? 
  sorry but i know next to nothing about politics in poland . 
  i think his comment is misreported . 
  from the same site , the greek edition of the reportage says : `` we do n't accept the turkish positions in this matter * . 
  we are doing diplomacy and there is not other option . 
  else it 's war '' * he was referring to the casus belli turkey has against greece in case greece extends its territorial waters as much as the international law permits . 
  it 's really a matter of bad journalism . 
  that 's what i said mate : that he defends part of europe ( eu ) from greece ( another part of the eu ) . 
  there 's no defending happening . 
  anyway ... 
  so in other words he claims he is defending europe from greece ? 
  what pompous idiot !, 
  here 's a supreme tank for you !,

  it 's like the nukes . 
  once you have them , you let everyone know . 
  else there 's no gain in having them . 
  olympias is serious trouble . 
  even watching the vid on youtube , the music gives you a headache !, 
  lol, 
  you need to hurry up , we are ahead of you : here 's argo reconstructed after 3500 years : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-s_0bwc7hi8 here 's a trireme olympias : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36figac4m1c :d, 
  sure !, 
  surely the bestest , the devine : http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03209/kimhair-kim_3209242k.jpg, 
  why not eus europa ? 
  it would be a ship with a great design , lots of arms great on board cuisine ( advanced replicators ) , very speedy ( ferrari engines ) but in order to decide where the hell it should go it would take months ( even years ) of negotiations , lots of committees and many regulations to follow . 
  congrats neighbors !,
