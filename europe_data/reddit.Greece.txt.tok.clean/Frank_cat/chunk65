  the map covers it well enough . 
   our neighbors were way up the map by the boristhenis ( dnieper ) banks probably fishing and splashing and play that sort of games . 
  also in greek . 
  can be even more specific . 
  those were the days ... 
  are your sure ? 
  this . 
  can confirm too . 
  it 's the fact that turkey doesnt accept back illegal immigrants ( not refugees , moroccans , pakistanis , bangladeshis , algerians etc ) that come through their border ( as international law commants ) that point to all this . 
  fyi those illegal immigrants are about 50 % of the people that cross the aegean sea to greece . 
  i hope you are right mate !, 
  i 've got nothing against the turkish people . 
  your governments though are another matter ... 
  your government is doing nothing about the subject - not even following the already made agreements - and that 's a fact not speculation . 
  * neighboring turkey is also involved in the issue , since the majority of the illegal immigrants are reaching greece from that country . 
  [ 23 ] ** characteristically , turkish official policy sees the flow of immigrants to greece as a main factor of conducting foreign policy . 
  the turkish governments officially adopts the `` ozal doctrine '' , initiated by former turkish prime minister , turgut \u00d6zal . 
  the latter characteristically stated that : [ 23 ] [ 24 ] we do not need to make war with greece . 
  we just need to send them a few millions illegal immigrants from turkey and finish with them . 
  ** most of the illegal immigrants are passing the greek-turkish borders with the tolerance or even the assistance of the authorities in turkey regardless the bilateral agreements that have been approved for this matter since 2003 . 
  moreover , the fact that the turkish authorities are not complying with the terms of the signed agreements is creating several problems during the procedures of surrender of the illegal immigrants in the border areas . 
  non-cooperation by the turkish side is also evident , despite the existence of specific proofs in several cases ( i.e. 
  turkish smugglers of illegal immigrants arrested by greek authorities ) .

  i wish mate but i am affraid it wont happen easily . 
  besides the refugees , turkey sells 50 euro airplane tickets ( turkish airlines ) to moroccans without any visa requirement etc. 
  turkey is clearly using all those people ( refugees and illegal immigrants alike ) . 
  nowadays it 's a tradition in many countries . 
  my initial post was on where it was originated . 
  yes i have strong evidence that it was originated in ancient greece as there was the same custom for the same reasons ( coming of spring , growth of the vegetation ) with only a different name : kroke ( \u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03ba\u03b7 ) . 
  on the other hand i heard no evidence ( zero , nada ) for it originated anywhere else . 
  i am open to accept anything as far as evidence is given . 
  you keep chatting on how wrong i am , even arrogant yet you provide nothing . 
  no evidence , no context , nothing . 
  typical ? 
  as for dionisus ... that is totally another subject . 
  there are ancient sources ( hint : greek sources ) that claim it was thracian and others that is was a greek diety . 
  surely it wasnt bulgarian though . 
  you call that cooperation ? 
  overoptimistic you sound ... 
  i have the suspicion that it was meant as a joke . 
  do n't lose your cool . 
  of course not everything is greek , i agree to that . 
  now please give me one context on why this custom is bulgarian . 
  please ? 
  ps it is not a bulgarian custom . 
  it is a custom in many balkan countries , from romania to crete and everything in between . 
  rich or not , i gave historical context . 
  as for the * traditional everything comes from the greeks * well sorry but no one stopped you find what the greeks have . 
  i wo n't feel sorry that greeks invented so much . 
  a few points : - you do n't know what was thracian as no language survives and no writings exist , yet you claim that the custom 's origin can be thracian . 
  no explanations given , no evidence , no sources , nothing but you talk about thracian * explanations * . 
  yet you call me arrogant , although i took the time to explain what i said , gave historical reference and the explanations given by historians . 
  - you call me arrogant , * `` to say that this tradition originated in greece , especially when the tradition is most vibrant in bulgaria '' * . 
  how it is more vibrant in bulgaria ? 
  i explained it 's * different * what happens in greece . 
  i hope you understand the word different . 
  and being more * vibrant * in bulgaria , makes gives it a bulgarian origin ? 
  then how about the albanians that have the same tradition ? 
  why do you forget them ? 
  why they have it ? 
  - it could be south americans , or freaking aliens that brought the tradition in the region . 
  i could n't care less and i 'm open to accept it , bring some evidence though and do n't just say `` it 's because we enjoy it more '' . 
  i do n't follow nor dismissing any thracian roots about it . 
  i simply have no data that would connect it with thrace . 
  anything other that the custom is present in the area that was called thrace ca n't be found in literature . 
  on the other hand plenty is around about the ancient `` kroke '' of eleusinian mysteries that was a very similar ( almost identical ) practice . 
  in fact only the name differs . 
  hahaha yeah . 
  it 's not strange though if you come to think how isolated many regions in greece were at the past . 
  hence the dialects and different accents . 
  all greek mainland as far as i know . 
  edit : in the islands it 's called martis , on mainland martitsi . 
  i do have sources but they are in greek . 
  also this article : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/martenitsa says that : * `` the tradition is related to the ancient pagan history of the balkan peninsula and to all ** agricultural cults of nature ** . 
  some specific features of the ritual , especially tying the twisted white and red woolen threads , are a result of centuries-old tradition and suggest thracian ( paleo-balkan ) hellenic or even roman origins * a roman custom in the balkans is far fetched as the roman took the greek religion and most of the customs . 
  the eleusinian mysteries was about demeter ( goddess of agriculture ) and her search of persephone ( her daugther ) who was abducted and taken to the underworld ( were everyone is pale ) . 
  her ( demeter 's ) struggle was to find persephone and bring it back on the world under the sun . 
  persephone was the goddess of vegetation and she was allowed to leave the underworld in spring ( hence the plants grow ) . 
  she was coming back on earth , pale for she was in the underworld with pluto . 
  that was what mother 's in ancient greece that were to mimic and put the \u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03ba\u03b7 in the arms and legs of their children . 
  of course it 's pagan custom ( greeks were pagans ) . 
  whereabout in greece are you ? 
  here 's an article about it : http://www.epiruspost.gr/reportaz/koinonia/11617-2012-03-01-02-06-11.html, 
  the custom 's roots are from the [ eleusinian mysteries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eleusinian_mysteries ) * . 
  it was about mothers protecting their children ( from the sun getting stronger at the spring ) . 
  i do n't know why the romans did n't `` adopt '' this practice . 
  it did remain though in greece in christian and byzantine times and it is still alive today . 
  the difference here in greece is that mostly ( or should i say almost exclusively ) children wear it and it is the mothers that make it . 
  a friend could give you one , but it 's mothers that make them 99.99 % of the time for their own children . 
  edit * it was called \u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03ba\u03b7 ( kroke ) then, 
  actually that is not true . 
  last month alone 5 new centers were build . 
  they got full in no time though . 
  it is a tradition all over greece . 
  here it is called martitsi . 
  children wear it on their arms so to be protected from sun burns . 
  this custom originated in ancient eleusis . 
  member of the eleusis mysteries used to tie a thread on their right arm and a thread on their left leg ( they called it \u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03ba\u03b7 kroke ) . 
  again to be protected from sun burns .
