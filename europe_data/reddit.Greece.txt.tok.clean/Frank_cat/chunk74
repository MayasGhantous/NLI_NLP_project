  cause `` pay debts sooner '' . 
  that 's nonsense . 
  in albania for example there are many weapons in the hands of the general public . 
  they emptied the army 's depos back in 1994 during the revolt days . 
  nope germany didnt sabotage anything . 
  didnt say anything remotely like that . 
  on the contrary on many issues we share the same views with germany . 
  edit : and to clarify it even more : the only ones that will have a problem with that are the eastern ex soviet members of our european family . 
  but as they turned their heads away and build walls when the refugee crisis happened and told us `` it 's your problem to secure your borders '' , maybe now we too should turn our heads and tell them `` it 's your problem to secure your borders '' . 
  2nd edit to down voters : aint life a bitch ? 
  what goes around comes around , karma and all that jazz !, 
  rotflmao . 
  bring on the balalaikas !, 
  germany wont have any problem with that . 
  they 've agreed to the nord stream after all !, 
  a good , a classic education is always admirable . 
  keep up the good work !, 
  literally `` wanker '' but has much more to it . 
  have a look here please : http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=malaka&amp;page=2, 
  we should take advantage . 
  deal for a southstream ii and sell a few assets . 
  a russian base on an aegean island wouldnt be a bad idea either . 
  easy !, 
  they talk loud and every other word is `` malakas '' . 
  we also had a pretty cool garage scene during the 60s .

  nope !, 
  not everything is related to the economic crisis . 
  death is though . 
  that 's awfully nice !, 
  that ca n't happen !, 
  cyprus too !, 
  we too feel very close to italians !, 
  name and shame then , do n't make a general remark . 
  it 's poland and malta . 
  it 's malta . 
  yes bro !, 
   `` our country is a country that has everything . 
  but our leaders in government have made very bad decisions '' -- food bank operator heikki hursti i know , trust me ... :(, 
  for the sake of modern , democracy loving , liberal turks i hope erdogan fails miserably . 
  do n't lose hope neighbors . 
  greek names very stronk !, 
  ireland is super cool too !, 
   but seriously mate , if you like greece why do n't you come live with us ? 
  you 'll find that we are not only hospitable but fond of the irish too !, 
  iceland or north west scotland . 
  yeah . 
  and i blame it on the economic mess . 
  i agree on everything you say about syriza and syriza voters . 
  i never voted for them cons . 
  yet , syriza came to power with under the 20 % of the greek ( electorate ) people . 
  they 've got about 36 % of the votes when about 50 % of people did n't go to vote due to extreme disappointment for the political parties . 
  why do you bring the spaghetti monster into the discussion ? 
  who blamed it ? 
  as for your government , yeah i 'm sure you deserve it but i 'm not that sure you both are to be blamed in equal measures . 
  time will tell . 
  have n't you heard ? 
  we only keep whining ... :p the fact of the matter is that we should see the hard fucking reality and start not giving a damn about anyone but ourselves . 
  as everyone does ; an example : germany goes on with the nordstream . 
  why the fuck should n't we go on with the south stream ? 
  and lift all sanctions to russia while at it . 
  it 's as simple as that : you vote for some politicians based on some vague promises , ** once every four years ** . 
  they ( the politicians ) make decisions ** every single day ** . 
  on most matters you do n't have the slightest idea on what 's going one . 
  and i am not even mentioning manipulation , broken promises and many other dirty tricks politicians use . 
  where do you live ? 
  in some kind of utopia ? 
  yes they should and they certainly are . 
  there is a limit though to were the people 's responsibilities end and were the governments responsibilities start . 
  but they did . 
  didnt they bomb the fuck out of iraq ? 
  and you seem ( still ) to agree with that `` logic '' . 
  you only question if dropping thousants of bombs on some faraway country is war or not !, 
  pah !, 
  we could 've have ? 
  who is `` we '' ? 
  my neighbor ? 
  the government ? 
  it is like telling you , `` you shouldnt have told lies about iraq and saddam . 
  you shouldnt have killed thousants of innocent people in iraq .
