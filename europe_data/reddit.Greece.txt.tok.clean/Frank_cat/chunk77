  nope !, 
  actually this headwear was byzantine . 
  the turks took it from them . 
  happy birthday greece !, 
  sigh, 
  perhaps mate . 
  i hope so ... 
  cause i 'm sick and tired of the ages old mantra `` greeks and turks are at each others throats '' etc. 
  we arent . 
  we only want our peace and quiet . 
  we have enough problems on our own and we dont need any general or politician from the east to create problems cause he wants `` public acceptance '' . 
  until recently almost everyone in europe was wandering `` why the heck does greece spend so much on their army '' ? 
  well now they now how it is to have a lunatic govern a neighboring country . 
  you know how it goes mate ... `` do as i say , not as i do '' you immoral * ( x ) * . 
  in place of x please put some geographic generalization ( southerner , east european etc. ), 
  i do agree with what you are saying . 
  and what you describe is universally accepted as true . 
  there is a huge difference the way you put it and the way it was by r/fortean . 
  look at it :  there 's little doubt it will be greece , ** especially because it will actually help ** the greek government as well as the turkish one . 
  this is totally wrong . 
  that statement implies that there is a special reason and an actual fact in our case . 
  that it will happen * ** especially and because ** it will help our govt * . 
  erdogan cares for no one else but his own govt and that 's the only fact, 
  no fecking not . 
  we constanlty have to face provocations as the ones that all europe is now facing . 
  that doesnt mean we want them , like them or put us on the same level . 
  one can not `` equalise '' the agressor and his victims . 
  it is simply disgusting . 
  see a turkish analysis on the subject : http://www.turkishminute.com/2017/01/31/opinion-turkey-picking-fight-greece/ you see that the problem goes beyond erdogan . 
  fortunately not all turks fall for such antics . 
  what kind of idiotic leveling is that ? 
  how can you say something that stupid ? 
  and most of all unjust . 
   because it will actually help the greek government as well as the turkish one do you imply that erdogan choses his `` targets '' thinking which foreign government will be helped by his verbal attacks ? 
  is this why he chose netherlands or germany and - for instance - not portugal ? 
  had he in his mind the opportunity to help merkel 's govt ? 
  and how something like that would help the greek govt ( and more so than some other govt ) ? 
  the only thing that would help our fecking govt is some financial success story . 
  something that tsipras isnt able to provide . 
  seriously ... did you pull this out of your arse ? 
  i think it will be us . 
  edit . 
  turks see it too : [ why turkey is picking a fight with greece ] ( http://www.turkishminute.com/2017/01/31/opinion-turkey-picking-fight-greece/ ), 
  it 's just a [ prank ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2wrglmsjk ) bro . 
  can also mean `` reason '', 
  it was a joke mate !, 
  hey !, 
  cough * orthodox * cough, 
  hahahah not only that but also by feeling he had to explain to the southerners that this was only bluntness , he indirectly suggest we are not used to the truth and are hypocrites !, 
  :d lol, 
  and do n't forget ... a bit of heat over the internet is fun . 
  but it 's only that : a joke . 
  to swallow , to accept !, 
  anyway ... whatever our opinions , everything 's fine by me . 
  have a nice afternoon buddy !, 
  lol it 's very hard for you to neck it down . 
  we 've got used to it . 
  also we have hope for them . 
  there are plenty decent people there . 
  sooner or later they 'll take control . 
  i wish ... but dont hold your breath bro ... 
   `` if europe continues this way , no european in any part of the world can walk safely on the streets . 
  we , as turkey , call on europe to respect human rights and democracy , '' omg !, 
  not even in antarctica ? 
  how ` bout japan ? 
  chile ? 
  ** panic ** what will i do ? 
  where should i go ? 
  i guess protestant europe aint western since they ( like us ) opposed catholicism . 
  even in the same religion & dogma cultures can differ quite alot .

  yeah right !, 
  lol, 
  there 's nothing more ridiculous than someone laughing on his own ignorance and missconseptions . 
  the `` west '' is a term to discribe a certain civilization : the greco-roman one . 
  the term might have been used later but it always refered to exactly that . 
  christianity became part of the western identity later . 
  it 's not even necessary to be part of the west , as many heathen ( were ) or atheist nations belong to the west . 
  it 's not surprizing that you have this misconception about what is western because it is a cultural thing to which you dont belong . 
  just look at the state of modern turkey . 
  after a century of securalism the country goes full speed to become something like pakistan . 
  a theocratic state . 
  all the western values failed cause they were foreign to your culture . 
  yet you think you know what `` west '' is lol . 
  it is not a geographical term ( australia is a western society ) and certainly not a religious one . 
  surely islam would never appeal the west as it has many elements that contradict our civilization . 
  do yourself a favor and try to educate yourself a bit : historian es creasy , in 1851 , included marathon in his account of the 15 decisive battles of world history , and more famously , in 1846 , john stuart mill declared in his essay on early grecian history and legend : `` the true ancestors of the european nations are not those from whose blood they are sprung , but those from whom they derive the richest portion of their inheritance . 
  the battle of marathon , even as an event in british history , is more important than battle of hastings . 
  if the issue of that day had been different , the britons and the s might still have been wandering in the woods . '' '' [ western ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_culture ) culture is characterized by a host of artistic , philosophic , literary , and legal themes and traditions ; the heritage of ** greek ** , roman , jewish , [ 1 ] celtic , slavic , and other ethnic and linguistic `` a ** cornerstone of western thought , beginning in ancient greece ** and continuing through the middle ages and renaissance and into modern times , is a tradition of rationalism in various spheres of life , ** developed by hellenistic philosophy , scholasticism , humanism , the scientific revolution and the enlightenment ** .

  idiot !, 
   maybe he meant well i very much doubt it . 
  such remarks are on the same level as erdogan 's . 
  yeah right the south is decadent and the north has hard working moral people . 
  we know the story ...
