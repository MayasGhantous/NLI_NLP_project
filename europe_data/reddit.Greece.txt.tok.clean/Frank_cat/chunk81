  for the following though : | and if everyone was doing it , why the pedantic reply to the op that suggested orthodox culture was present within the ottoman empire ? | i will . 
  one has to be a complete moron to talk about the presence of the orthodox culture within the ottoman empire . 
  there was only the most vile form of oppression . 
  if you were an orthodox and for that reason alone you could own not a field to support your family . 
  you had to pay taxes even for the right to burn wood in the winter to heat your house . 
  only if you were christian . 
  you had to pay more taxes to be allowed to live . 
  you could n't use the church to get married or have your children baptised . 
  you could only do that in your home . 
  they would take your male children in a young age , turn them into muslims fanatics and send them back to fight you . 
  just to name a few . 
  you could get free from all the above if you turned to islam . 
  if you do n't see that all this was an active way to eradicate christianity then i 'm sorry but i ca n't help you . 
  dont tell me about the presence of the orthodox culture though as if it was allowed to be freely . 
  you mean like everyone else did ? 
  like muslims continue to do so ? 
  ffs do you even know what blood tax was ? 
  how can you possibly say something so anal ? 
  everything turkic and you 've got r/anarchotech to defend it every way possible . 
  repeatedly . 
  check him out . 
  yeah by paying blood tax and paying jizya . 
  what a sweet thing to do ( for a state ) !, 
  to welcome its new citizens this way !, 
  finland you are fantastic !, 
  what an awful thing to do . 
  no it isnt so . 
  at the time everyone was trying to make an empire , to expand their kingdom , califate , khanate you name it . 
  it was the `` mentality '' of the time . 
  some have succed it , some didnt . 
  those who were unsuccesful arent less guilty . 
  simple as that . 
  when i said `` cause you are the outcome of all that ... '' i did n't mean physically . 
  i mean as a character , a mindset . 
  exactly !, 
  it 's not wrong to feel pride for something collectively achieved by his society/people . 
  that 's my opinion . 
  when it comes to slavery , i agree it 's something unethical and evil . 
  one though must judge having in mind the context of the time he/she isinvestigating . 
  at that time slavery - unfortunately - was common place in many parts of the globe . 
  almost everywhere . 
  should the whites in the us feel guilty about their ancestors evil actions ? 
  i 'd say yes , but no more than the guilt blacks should feel ( slavery was common among african people , actually they did sell the captives of war etc. 
  ) , the arabs , the chinese , the indians ( with their cast system ) etc. 
  the only country in the world that slavery still exists at large is an african country : [ mauritania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavery_in_mauritania ) but no one talks about it . 
  only about `` white guilt '' . 
  so if one asks for guilt , he should ask it from everyone ( it 's a failure for the whole mankind ) else it 's hypocritical . 
  hahahahahha well spotted !, 
  :d edit : come to think of it , there some truth in it . 
  the region was colonised by greeks . 
  marseille and nice were founded by greeks . 
  thank you !, 
  cause you are the outcome of all that and from what it looks from here it did n't turn bad at all . 
  they should be proud of what they accomplished . 
  i find this `` guilt '' so hypocritical to ask when in reality the brits did what every_feckin_else on the planet tried to do for millennia . 
  actually is kinda mandatory here to insult the politicians . 
  no matter what position they 've got . 
  they deserve it and well know it !, 
  when it comes to economy you 're absolutely right my friend . 
  when it comes to the sun we do !, 
  we love you and we do n't want anything bad happen to you !, 
  also to our danish and other north european brothers and sisters : apply sunscreen , stay in the shade , wear a hat !, 
  i hope not !, 
  the way he continuously talks shit , one would think that he [ fell on his head and has his balls crushed ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhfyp7xp0bc ) . 
  nothing !, 
  nothing can beat [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaolu6zkaws ) !, 
  but ... but greeks retire at 40s and 50s ( that 's the narrative ) . 
  surely this is wrong !, 
  lots of water !, 
  majestic !, 
  something between german & dutch . 
  i like it !, 
  i like him !, 
  we ( in greece ) like him . 
  not everything is about money you know ... 
  hahahahaha !, 
  the twilight zone !, 
  # 5 for me please !, 
  the best cevapcici i 've ever had was in a croatian restaurant in munich !, 
  delicious ca n't begin to describe it !, 
  tough luck erdogan !, 
  austria is n't a neighbour you can harass . 
  | ... holy shit turkey is going full ~ ~ 1939 ~ ~ 1539 | ftfy, 
  but why ? 
  croatia is a fine addition to the eu . 
  i 'm glad you are in !, 
  i know nothing about dutch cuisine but dutch ovens must do something rather special to earn a [ certain ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dutch%20oven ) reputation . 
  erdogan has a referendum to win on april and by making external enemies he hopes to gather the nationalistic votes ( grey wolves and the likes ) . 
  they ca n't . 
  and they do n't interfere . 
  [ greek ] ( http://sail-ingreece.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/yachting-main-760x500.jpg ) icebreaker . 
  it works wonder to brake the ice . 
  if the german govt wo n't respond to the call for help , we can send varoufakis !, 
  love it !, 
  to do what in the black sea ? 
  they are in aegean due to refugees . 
  do n't mind them mate . 
  what you said is sane alas it doesnt allow them to turn economics into pathetic `` morality '' lessons . 
  greeks might be orthodox as russians are but the culture is very different . 
  the map is not about religion per se .
