  good luck to you and your country too . 
  the mid/long term future wo n't be very bright for anyone , i hope both countries will be able to cope . 
  estonia : population \u2022 2017 estimate increase 1,317,797 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonia greece : population 2015 estimate 10,955,000 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greece so * roughly * 10 times the population 10 times the gdp . 
  you aint good with data aint you ? 
  the more * up to date data * is also 2 years old . 
  a lot of water under the bridge . 
  also fyi none of the money 's gone to greece . 
  they 've gone strait to the german and french ( mostly ) banks . 
  to pay the toxic loans they gave . 
  you know * we * did some serious shit but those banks are equally responsible . 
  yet they take all the aid . 
  i do n't say we are in the worst position in the eu ( we might * ) but your claims are not valid . 
  please dig a little deeper than the skin deep analysis the media usually provide . 
  * for instance cancer patients ca n't have chemos any more , yet we have to spend more than 2 % of out gdp for defence . 
  does estonia do the same ? 
  only very very recently as i gather . 
  edit : you know we have a surplus budget ? 
  so yes no more help like the one we received all these years . 
  2nd edit : does germany spend 2 % of its gdp for defence ? 
  nope !, 
  free riders . 
  so much for trust . 
  thats 6 years of the most severe economic crisis ever !, 
  but i get your point : in order to prove * something * one could use everything . 
  :p why should i find any data ? 
  i have n't made any claim ( not about nuts ) . 
  he who makes a claim has the burden to prove it . 
  hint : with up to date data !, 
  from the link you provided : ** gdp per capita in pps of eu average nuts 3 - year 2010 ** you are talking about 2010 ?!?!?!? 
  you know it 's 2017 ? 
  some very harsh 7 years passed already and the situation is nothing like you describe . 
  to make your point stronger : here 's the per capita income in 14 ad . 
  and scapegoats !, 
  nope !, 
  they live in tent cities or in proper govt buildings ( not flats or anything , just a bed ) and they are provided with food . 
  we ca n't afford anything better not even for our own citizens . 
  there are n't any . 
  not for the greeks too . 
  these are the top destinations for danish tourists . 
  you can find info there : https://www.helpadane.com/home/, 
  i would gladly help a dane !, 
  edit : signed up here : https://www.helpadane.com/greece/, 
  i do n't think so . 
  we prolly going to find out as this is what schauble wants and works for . 
  stay tuned . 
  now that 's something to go by . 
  a solid conclusion about all greeks . 
  that is horrible !, 
  poor kids ... 
  thank you !, 
  yes . 
  whenever there something bugging the sultan he gets his eyes on the aegean . 
  he really wanted/demanded those soldiers and when he did n't get them he started threatening us . 
  now that is golden !, 
  lol, 
  so predictable it 's like a bad comedy !, 
  yes i do !, 
  average salary ( pensions are a % of that ) https://www.reinisfischer.com/average-salary-european-union-2016 food cost : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/4187653/7836003/pricelevelindex2015/ http://i.imgur.com/vtcbhvr.png jeasus !, 
  i really admire germans for that . 
  not only they did not allow the past to define them but now they have a wonderful attitude and way of thinking . 
  respect !, 
  never ever were pensions or salaries the same in germany and in greece . 
  never !, 
  you are misinformed my friend . 
  and how can that be done ? 
  by staying divided ? 
  does it ? 
  people pay for pension a proportion ( % ) of their salary . 
  salaries in germany are also more than twice than those in greece . 
  in greece when you 're 67 and do n't have at least 35 years then you get the minimum ( 440euros ) which is below the poverty line . 
  45 % of the pensioners get just that . 
  there are no other social benefits . 
  you must also take into account that people here face more unemployment than that in germany ( 51 % among the young ) . 
  so yeah it is completely different . 
  but hey !, 
  if one doesnt want to see it then there is no way to make him see it . 
  skin deep analysis , cliches etc come to the rescue ( :p ) . 
  i hope so . 
  we are lucky that the social fabric in greece ( family , friends ) is still strong . 
  that 's what get us going . 
  timing ? 
  what 's that got to do with what should be done . 
  it 's not a matter of luck but a matter of principles . 
  merkel is the leader of a major european power , it 's not like she would be scared by the sultan . 
  we past the test , time for others to do the same . 
  indeed we fucked up . 
  also did n't blame the refugees about it . 
  the timing is making things worse though . 
  it was all our fault mate . 
  indeed it was . 
  the problem is what should be done now . 
  i see no end to this . 
  she 's just started the cure . 
  she found out a month ago . 
  given the circumstances , well enough . 
  thank you she needs it . 
  she 's got it bad ... she already has metastasis in the spine and lymph nodes . 
  as for the drugs , friends help her to buy them . 
  some of them were send away from the country . 
  yes they are and face the consequences .
