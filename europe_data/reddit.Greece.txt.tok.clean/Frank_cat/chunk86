  you have to understand though it is difficult to prove as they claim that used their boat to save people already stranded at the sea ( and not that they are doing proper trafficking ) . 
  also last year when fyrom closed its borders and our police prevented migrants to reach them , they ( ngo members ) gave them ( immigrants ) maps written in arabic ( !!! ), 
  on where they could find alternative crossings . 
  some of them are doing good work but many have shady ways . 
  that is very beautiful !, 
  thanks for sharing !, 
  yeah !, 
  that 's is fixed already . 
  here in greece many hospitals ( that used to ) do n't provide treatments for cancer anymore . 
  those that do , have a waiting period of 6 months * ( in the best cases easy drugs to find ) . 
  2 birds with one stone : lowers health costs and cuts social spending ( pensions etc ) at together . 
  at the same time many ngos give more to refugees ( per month ) than the minimum pensions ( 45 % of all ) are . 
  what can go wrong ? 
  * a friend of mine is in that waiting status . 
  it was good to clarify cause as far as ancient large castles go we have [ akrocorinth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/acrocorinth ) , 
  well the dirtiest place in greece ( where the coal operating energy plants are ) has [ 68 ] ( http://aqicn.org/map/greece/ ) . 
  the rest of the country has too much clean air to register . 
  well with [ 45 percent of pensions are below poverty line ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-greece-pensions-idusl5n0z12ps20150616 ) and [ youth unemployment about 50 % ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/regdata/etudes/brie/2015/542220/ipol_bri ( 2015 ) 542220_en . pdf ) it 's a miracle we do n't have kim jong un to rule us ... :(, 
  you know statistics sometimes tell you what you want to hear . 
  for example : '' in greece , pensions are on average 80 % of the income . 
  in germany , 45 % '' well that means 882 euros ( that in 2015 before the cuts implemented on pensions . 
  [ source ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/06/26/eurostat-greek-pensions-average-e882/ ) . 
  nowadays the average one is about 650 euros . 
  - '' in greece , you need 35 years to retirement . 
  in germany 45 . '', 
  the reality is that if you reach the age of 67 you have to have at ** least ** 35 years . 
  those that get a mention below the age of 67 , get the minimum which is about 440 euros . [ source ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/minimum-wages ) . 
  - `` the maximum pension in greece is $ 2,580 . 
  in germany $ 2100 '' . 
  yeah for the president of the republic . 
  : s draws a completely different picture , not ? 
  hint : do n't just read articles and think you are informed . 
  you see articles * sometimes * carry an agenda . 
  what 's `` funny '' is that it is supposed that this ( a true union ) was the target all along . 
  hence the change from eec ( european economic community ) to eu ( european union ) . 
  but since some feel it 's better for them they turned the whole project back to a eec . 
  then they wonder what will go wrong . 
  i will , if i meet him . 
  although i have to say we do n't hang out together . 
  he 's too much of a leftist for my tastes . 
  `` finger pointing '' blah blah blah blah . 
  check the facts , they aint a dw article . 
  in fact there are so many ngos here causing so many problems to the local societies the gov is doing some serious investigation about the role they are playing . 
  they even caused problem with neighbouring countries . 
  but hey !, 
  you know better !, 
  you 've read a dw article somewhere in the carpathian mountains ( i 'd like to picture it this way as it 'd draw a nicer picture ) . 
  do n't listen to me having to cope with all this shit in the middle of a severe financial crisis ( yeah yeah i know our fault ) . 
  99.9 % of those funds go to ngos . 
  nothing to do with greece . 
  beautiful !, 
  you 're blessed with a wonderful language !, 
  i do agree , it 's not going to happen . 
  you see the current politicians failed to explain to the electorate the advantages a serious integration / a true union would bring to their lives . 
  far greater than thee cost of a fiscal union . 
  it 's not only about the fiscal union ( funny how nowadays it 's only about that :p ) . 
  we 've seen how fragmented was the eu when it came to the immigrant crisis and many other issues . 
  instead they go around bragging how well they use the eu to pursuit the national interests and when something 's bad how `` it 's the eu fault '' . 
  that 's why even though i am a federalist i am very pessimistic about the eu 's future . 
  between trump 's interests and putin 's manipulations it 's gon na crumble . 
  [ paroles paroles ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ifjapuqyiu ), 
  best castle evah !, 
  no it is not a pun . 
  we say trump got the `` chrisma '' to be the new president . 
  chrisma has many meanings , look it up : https://el.glosbe.com/el/el/%cf%87%cf%81%ce%af%cf%83%ce%bc%ce%b1, 
  also means chosen and confirmed ( in this case as son of god ) . 
  cause christos ( christ ) comes not from khrima ( money ) but from chrisma ( son of god ) . 
  that 's why one is written with iota and the other with eta, 
  it is definitely not anti-turkey . 
  it is in our constitution : everyone regardless of what they 've done are entitled of a fair trial . 
  human rights above everything else . 
  as is the situation in turkey at the moment , do you honestly think they 'd have a fair trial ? 
  we 've all seen the way others were treated . 
  so no . 
  we only do what we would have done for everyone . 
  that 's a relief !, 
  excellent news !, 
  [ divine kim jong un approves !, 
  ] ( https://cdn.meme.am/cache/instances/folder273/500x/64524273.jpg ), 
  indeed they are even more complex to grasp as it would n't stand without the weight on it . 
  instinctively one would think a heavier `` roof '' is bad or the construction , yet someone ( around 1250 bc ) understood it perfectly . 
  also engineering wise it 's the same thing . 
  atreus would be spinning in his tholos . 
  hahahaha, 
  spending cuts here have gone so far already . 
  i guess you are misinformed . 
  `` unnecessary expenses '' like chemo drugs . 
  last week one of the largest hospitals in athens ( and in the whole country ) announced they are postponing chemotherapy sessions as it has no drugs . 
  i bet you can understand what postponing therapy sessions means to these patients . 
  i do n't ask ( or want ) for help but enough with the skin deep analysis . 
  please . 
  edit : the hospital is the `` laiko hospital '' in athens . 
  you are absolutely right !, 
  96 % of the greek population agrees with you . 
  it just happened you bumped to one member a minority of greeks that live on pink clouds and ca n't see a threat even with a gun on their face . 
  a sad day for everyone ... :(, 
  poor thing ... :(, 
  what 's the problem to refer to them as `` baltic states '' . 
  why should that dreadful `` soviet '' nightmare continue to describe what they did not ever wanted to be ? 
  cause some idiotic journalists find it cool ?
