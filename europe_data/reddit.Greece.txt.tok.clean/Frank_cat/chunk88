  people here have it for breakfast and supper ( mostly ) . 
  greece can into nordic !, 
  how about republic of copy pasta \u00a9 ? 
  so far they 've copied the history of all their neighbours so it would be an exact name . 
  finally . 
  it not the mountain slopes that block the weather systems so for them to stay on the western part of the pindos mountain range . 
  it 's the upstream currents that do it . 
  so when these currents are stronger on the eastern side of the mountain the clouds are blocked there . 
  weather systems come from the atlantic . 
  they are blocked by the pindos mountain range so they empty their load here . 
  i think estonia and malta win !, 
  very cool !, 
  the bully of the neighbourhood !, 
  scumbags of the highest degree . 
  how can one turn such a cunt !, 
  the temple of hephaestus is 500 years older and hasnt undergone through extensive restoration . 
  it was in use till 19th century too . 
  maison carree has gone through extensive restorations . 
  read from the wikipedia page : '' the building has undergone extensive restoration over the centuries . 
  until the 19th century , it formed part of a larger complex of adjoining buildings . 
  these were demolished when the maison carr\u00e9e housed what is now the mus\u00e9e des beaux-arts de n\u00eemes ( from 1821 to 1907 ) , restoring it to the isolation it would have enjoyed in roman times . 
  the pronaos was restored in the early part of the 19th century ** when a new ceiling was provided ** , designed in the roman style . 
  the present door was made in 1824 . '', 
  ahem ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/temple_of_hephaestus, 
  none of our business . 
  thank you !, 
  it is !, 
  it is !, 
  and mousaka is a lesser dish than fried shark !, 
  can i come now ? 
  god !, 
  i wan na move to iceland !, 
  only in navarino . 
  far less than how the brits and french did . 
  they also caused us catastrophes like the orlov revolt where they abandoned us and much later by helping enormously ataturk to fight against our army in asia minor . 
  thank god for the brits that fired the 1st shot !, 
  :d and the french and the russians !, 
   seems pretty high for a eu country . 
  got ta be a reason for that . 
  the reason is simple : we never had fight against each other . 
  you see we are very far from them . 
  unlike other european nations that suffered wars or the communist era . 
  japan is also a country that greeks view favorably . 
  that doesnt mean we have cultural connections . 
   russia assisted greece in the greek war of independence from the ottoman empire . 
  nope !, 
  name the incident if you can . 
  there isnt any . 
  diplomatic empty talk . 
  there 's no cultural connection between the two countries ( other than religion ) and historically the russians never helped us . 
  culturaly we are closer to protestand europe than orthodox russia ( yeah we have quite a different understanding of orthodoxy too ) look at that : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/inglehart_values_map.svg/610px-inglehart_values_map.svg.png, 
  what historical and what cultural ties ? 
  there are n't so many . 
  i seriously doubt that support for nato is that low in greece . 
  in case you ever decide to move in greece , know that you are very welcome !, 
  happy statehood day croatia !, 
  i wish that heatwave wont come here !, 
  if scotland and greece ever unite , this flag would do very well !, 
  i like it !, 
  here these names are common . 
  so very very sad ... :(, 
   ~ londistan ~ londopolis or londalphia take your pick !, 
  horrible news . 
  stay strong portuguese bros our hearts are with you !, 
  ffs the topic is not about who to blame . 
  to make it absolutely clear : it is our fault !, 
  ok now ? 
  can we get past that ? 
  the question atm is `` what can be done to improve things '' . 
  if your answer is `` nothing '' then by all means say it !, 
  it is your right . 
  but enough of this misguided ethical cliches and blame game . 
  i love them !, 
  do n't be sad !, 
  they are such a lovely place no one can resist it !, 
   the law requiring sharia is a greek law though out by conservative greeks to fight attaturks secular influence on the greek muslim minority after ww1 . 
  sources please . 
  that would be precise !, 
  has my vote !, 
   sadly , they hate us in the guts , because of the brain-washing-tito-machine which started 70 years ago . 
  we are hated for the same reason . 
  dont worry bro , we luv ya !, 
  aegean is deep blue : https://previews.123rf.com/images/songallery/songallery1403/songallery140300049/27017923-deep-blue-aegean-sea-with-clear-water-and-colourful-boat-stock-photo.jpg ionian has lighter colours : http://ionianparadise.gr/ionianpara/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/kathisma-beach-lefkada.jpg, 
  more likely [ craaaaaap ] ( http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/masonry/000/733/891/962.gif ) !, 
  no there aint people in greece that want to break away . 
  that doesnt mean that all this falsifying of history , maps showing lands to be `` liberated '' etc is a small issue . 
  building a country on false history and teaching the children on how your neighbours occupy their land etc etc. 
  is literally building a country on hate . 
  through the years we 've seen many manifestations of this and many provocations . 
  sorry but we were n't the aggressors here and it was our right to deny the lies and lawfully use our vetoes to the organisations or unions we are members . 
  beautiful !, 
  to show respect for the dead is a matter of dignity . 
  especially when those who were killed were innocent victims of terrorism . 
  saudis showing they are pricks who dont care about infidel deaths !, 
  what a surprize !, 
  no , thank you . 
  nope , fyrom consists of very little of the macedonian historical region . 
  http://peter.mackenzie.org/history/maps/macedonia1_336_bc-es.svg.png yet the former goverment not only claimed the ancient macedonians as their ancestors filling the country with kitsch alexander the great statues , naming airports etc. , but they even published maps showing parts of greek macedonia as part of their state or parts to be `` liberated '' . 
  https://img.joinfo.ua/i/2015/12/56718052e8501_8 ( 587 ) . jpg all this started during tito 's regime . 
  the fun part is that untill late 19th century , they themselves identified as bulgarians and killed anyone claiming macedonian ancestry .
