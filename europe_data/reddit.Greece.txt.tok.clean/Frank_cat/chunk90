  imo even if he 's gonne another `` erdogan '' will take his place . 
  it 's what the turkish society wants . 
  `` no no no i did n't punch them !, 
  it 's their faces that fell violently on my feasts '', 
  very interesting . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_lake_ ( croatia ), 
  this should be pan european . 
  good news !, 
  it 's colder up north ... 
  good !, 
  very beautiful !, 
  there are many words in greek going back to indo-european . 
  what is special is that the majority of the words in greek have n't changed at all for thousands of years . 
  i mentioned the sun and the sea , cause elytis writes that in his [ poem ] ( https://www.britannica.com/biography/odysseus-elytis#ref1021631 ) that won the nobel prize . 
  my examples were n't meant to prove anything . 
  they were to explain better a certain point to a fellow redditor . 
  there 's nothing that needs to be proven . 
  lol unfortunately it is n't so though city = polis but `` polis '' in `` ichtyo-polis '' is written differently . 
  it is written with eta ( h ) . 
  so it gives you the info it is about a human that sells . 
  but if i wrote it in english with eta it would seem very strange to you . 
  it would be polhs . 
  you are welcome . 
  to extent the example i gave you ... ichtys can be used in modern greek but it would sound too formal . 
  on the other hand for everything concerning fish it 's the ** only ** form to be used . 
  so fish = psari but fish farm = ichtyo-trofeio fish shop = ichtyo-poleio fish seller = ichtyo-polis fish market = ichty - agora etc. 
  so although there is a change between ancient and modern language , that change is minor and would n't be an obstacle for you to understand . 
  and as i already mentioned modern greek is in fact very old itself . 
  i know ... we are crazy . 
  let me give you an example . 
  fish in modern greek is psari . 
  in ancient greek is ichtys . 
  psari or opsari in ancient greek were specifically the small fish ( like sardines etc. ) . 
  but in modern greek fish farm is ichtyo-trofeio ( trofeio = farm ), 
  both !, 
  mostly words . 
  if one has a good grip of modern greek though ( large vocabulary ) it helps a great deal . 
  some changed their meaning and nowadays have a similar but not exactly the same . 
  the greek language is very structured . 
  there is a root word and tens of other words/meaning come out of it ( the too ) . 
  so through the centuries some words sharing the same root inter-changed their meaning . 
  but these changes are very minor comparing them to other languages . 
  modern greek ( which is spoken for more than a 1000 years ) is very closer to ancient greek than italian to latin . 
  with some difficulty i could . 
  i 'd get around 70 % of it . 
  but classical greek is different to koine greek too . 
  koine greek is very easy to understand . 
  the changes are very minimal though ( since xi century ) . 
  in fact koine greek ( bible greek ) is easily understood . 
  our language is unique in that perspective . 
  think of this : we still use the exact same words for the sun and the sea , that iliad and odyssey used . 
  they 'd be welcome here !, 
  orthodox priests can marry and raise families . 
  not quite . 
  oedipus did n't have a clue who his lover and wife was . 
  he simply fell in love with her . 
  and when he found out he took his own eyes out , out of horror . 
  cant say he had a complex . 
  it 's others that know who their mother are and have the complex . 
  froyd only used oedipus story to name their complex . 
  shhht do n't reveal the secrets of our language to the barbarians !, 
  well done italy !, 
  i hope everyone will follow your good example !, 
  we had that kind of meat in the army . 
  when the newcomers tasted it they used to ask : `` what kind of meat is this ? '', 
  the answer was always `` gotzila '' :d if you meet a greek ask him : `` did you ever tasted gotzila ? '', 
  see what happens !, 
  lol, 
  is that you ? 
  bacon is the absolute top !, 
  the plot is : he 's a muthafucka !, 
  sorry if i ruined it for you !, 
  it was expressed as such though . 
  anyway ... we are in agreement then . 
  wtf ?!?!?!, 
  is this real or a hoax ? 
  it 's you that 's the fucking idiot . 
  one just needs to apply the law . 
  how idiotic one should be to think that every pakistani , bangladeshi or moroccan has the right to enter the country ** illegally ** ? 
  why should they ? 
  do they suffer prosecutions ? 
  do they suffer a war ? 
  you have the nerve to call others idiots too !, 
  have a look : http://imgur.com/a/3cn6q and this is the situation after the paraskeuopoulos law . 
  remember the immigrant gang that got into the old lady 's apartment on the 8th floor in athens ? 
  the one that fell off the balcony had served * only * 4 years for 2 murders and 36 robberies . 
  he was n't in jail due to paraskeuopoulos . 
  so the situation is far worst than the above link shows . 
  so open your eyes . 
  nope we shall not ban all foreigners . 
  ex banning japanese wo n't do any difference . 
  we could start sending off illegal immigrants that are taking advantage of the refugee situation . 
  they are a burden to the refugees too . 
  edit : the blue ( top ) line represents foreign inmates . 
  just a crimewave . 
  : s more than 50 % in prisons are foreigners . 
  `` so long and thanks for the fish & chips '' :d, 
  to try to put things in the right context doesnt mean we deny accountability . 
  spare me that mantra please . 
  we hold not only that finance minister accountable but all the greek govts .
