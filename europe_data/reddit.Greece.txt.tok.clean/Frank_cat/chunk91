  oh enough with that myth please ... greece was accepted into the economic and monetary union of the european union by the european council on 19 june 2000 , based on a number of criteria ( inflation rate , budget deficit , public debt , long-term interest rates , exchange rate ) using 1999 as the reference year . 
  after an audit commissioned by the incoming new democracy government in 2004 , eurostat revealed that the statistics for the budget deficit had been under-reported . 
  [ 80 ] most of the differences in the revised budget deficit numbers were due to a temporary change of accounting practices by the new government , i.e. , recording expenses when military material was ordered rather than received . 
  [ 81 ] however , it was the retroactive application of esa95 methodology ( applied since 2000 ) by eurostat , that finally raised the reference year ( 1999 ) budget deficit to 3.38 % of gdp , thus exceeding the 3 % limit . 
  this led to claims that greece ( similar claims have been made about other european countries like italy ) [ 82 ] had not actually met all five accession criteria , and the common perception that greece entered the eurozone through `` falsified '' deficit numbers . 
  in the 2005 oecd report for greece , [ 83 ] it was clearly stated that `` the impact of new accounting rules on the fiscal figures for the years 1997 to 1999 ranged from 0.7 to 1 percentage point of gdp ; this retroactive change of methodology was responsible for the revised deficit exceeding 3 % in 1999 , the year of [ greece 's ] emu membership qualification '' . 
  the above led the greek minister of finance to clarify that the 1999 budget deficit was below the prescribed 3 % limit when calculated with the esa79 methodology in force at the time of greece 's application , and thus the criteria had been met . 
  [ 84 ] the original accounting practice for military expenses was later restored in line with eurostat recommendations , theoretically lowering even the esa95-calculated 1999 greek budget deficit to below 3 % ( an official eurostat calculation is still pending for 1999 ) . 
  an error sometimes made is the confusion of discussion regarding greece 's eurozone entry with the controversy regarding usage of derivatives ' deals with u.s. banks by greece and other eurozone countries to artificially reduce their reported budget deficits . 
  a currency swap arranged with goldman sachs allowed greece to `` hide '' 2.8 billion euros of debt , however , this affected deficit values after 2001 ( when greece had already been admitted into the eurozone ) and is not related to greece 's eurozone entry . 
  [ 85 ] a study of the period 1999 -- 2009 by forensic accountants has found that data submitted to eurostat by greece , among other countries , had a statistical distribution indicative of manipulation ; `` greece with a mean value of 17.74 , shows the largest deviation from benford 's law among the members of the eurozone , followed by belgium with a value of 17.21 and austria with a value of 15.25 '' .

  you just need to read bild it would be enough . 
  you 'll see that we are lazy , cheaters etc. . . one must not fall for tabloids though . 
  i can assure you , germans are very much liked here . 
  even the most misguided idiot who reads tabloids would might come to hate your govt but not the german people . 
  edit . 
  elefteros typos , the newspaper you that did that disgrace and that you are referring to have a total circulation of 6.260 papers/day . 
   but there were also many who painted merkel and sch\u00e4uble as hitler , and germany as the devil incarnate . 
  no , not many . 
  kke ( a stalinist party on its way to extinction ) and some radical leftists . 
  everyone here was against it and condemned it . 
  you have to understand though , that people here suffered immensely ( like cancer patients that left without chemo due to lack of medicine ) and at the same time we became the target of completely unfair and humiliating propaganda almost by all . 
  and yes , we are completely angry with our own politicians pasok ( a party usually getting 30 + % of the vote ) was eradicated , nd lost about 2/3 res of its electorate . 
  this is how syriza ( a 4 % party ) got elected to get the gov. 
  talking bout making things worse . 
  :( the tragedy here is exactly that . 
  moderate parties are not trusted anymore and people doesnt know who/what to vote . 
  i know mate . 
  that is another mistake in schauble 's policies . 
  internationaly many economists said that germany should increase wages and consume more but it all comes to deff ears . 
  both the german people doesnt see the benefits of their efforts and the ez economies face negative implications because of that . 
  imho schauble is a populist in a peculiar way . 
  boasts the ego of the electorate while giving them nothing . 
  disputed ? 
  why ? 
  it certainly is a country . 
  no disputes about that . 
  why not ? 
  his proposal though ... 
  he doesnt mean it . 
  he just do n't wan na say a resounding nein to macron so soon . 
  the devil hides in the details . 
  he proposes a european stability mechanism cause he ca n't control imf ( and imf has some strong objections to his policies ) and a ez parliament that would have * consultative * powers . 
  meaning ? 
  he keeps control . 
  `` we could create a euro zone parliament made up of members of the european parliament , which could have consultative powers over the european stability mechanism . '', 
  i think he 's playing and buys time . 
  i do n't think he really means it . 
  `` we could create a euro zone parliament made up of members of the european parliament , which could have * consultative * powers over the european stability mechanism . '', 
  http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-future-schaeuble-iduskbn1871fg consultative aka nothing . 
  nothing different with what is happening atm . 
  i do n't think anyone would fall for that ... 
  in greece if you are a communist you retire at 46 . 
  for the rest of us it 's 48 . 
  true !, 
  hardly a german thing . 
  the dutch also think we southerners are lazy scum . 
  the focus cover used a national symbol and our flag to show who is the fraudster . 
  it is characterizing all of us . 
  not a politician , not a political party but all of us . 
  i can assure you the vast majority here are not fraudsters . 
  also we did condemn ( all the politicians , all the parties , all the newspapers ) the act of an extremist left group to portray merkel as hitler . 
  it isnt the same though . 
  did the german politicians condemn bild 's articles ? 
  no one is taking bild seriously ? 
  yet people buy it by the millions ? 
  they should !, 
  how goebbels said it ? 
  `` a lie told once remains a lie but a lie told a thousand times becomes the truth '' . 
  cause that is what bild doing . 
  repeat again and agan a derogatory mantra against us . 
  as for portaing merkel as the next hitler you are right . 
  it was very cheap and very wrong . 
  thankfully it only happened once or twice and only by extreme leftists . 
  actually everyone condemned it here . 
  even the communist party . 
  you can relate the actions of a leftist group with the policies of a newspaper of vast circulation . 
  there were other instances too . 
  quite racist and scientificaly wrong too .

  work ? 
  hell no !, 
  i 'm lazy !, 
  build has a large circulation and although many say `` it is not a serious media '' they do shape the views of their readers . 
  it 's a shame cause many of what they wrote are so defamatory they are borderline racist . 
  example the dehumanization of us greeks : bild.de .

  accessed march 9 , 2013 . www.bild.de/regional/berlin/berlin-regional/sieben-jahre-haft-nach-schuessen-auf-griechen-10818488.bild.html see a very interesting article here : http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10304312.2016.1186604?src=recsys&amp; as for other media , i can think of [ focus ] ( http://beta.images.theglobeandmail.com/archive/01391/focus_1391572a.jpg ) for example . 
  seriously how can a trash like bild have such a large circulation in germany ? 
  oh but they did my friend . 
  they surely did . 
  i could also give you examples of the press ( other than the bild ) . 
  anyway it really doesnt matter . 
  greece is surely f * cked ( we did it oursleves , i dont put the blame on others ) , so if greece was indeed the problem it could be easily solved . 
  just expel it from ez . 
  but the true problem is deeper . 
  there 's now a divide between the north and the south ( i was reffering to that ) that a few years ago would 've been unthinkable . 
  there was strong criticism against the south and deaf ears for many years . 
  not only in economy but on other matters too .
