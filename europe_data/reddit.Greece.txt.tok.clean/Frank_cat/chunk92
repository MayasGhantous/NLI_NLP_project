  no one is willing to lead the people and change these ill perceptions . 
  german politicians have a huge responsibility on that . 
  unfortunately while we are all member states in th eu nowadays we mostly see `` my rights '' , `` my interests '' and nothing about pushing the project on . 
  a distructive situation . 
  french voters gave us all a new/last chance on waking up and move forward , but i cant see anyone taking it seriously . 
  if the situation doesnt change soon then all the reasons that put eu in danger will remain . 
  why italy , spain or france would want to be part of the eu if it stays as it is right now ? 
  she should , but she wont . 
  she , herr schauble and the press in germany played the tune of the `` lazy thieving southerners '' for much too long . 
  now they coulnt change it , if they tried . 
  not that they would try is as the current situation is quite positive for them . 
  i 'm affraid the european federation dream ( cause that was the target ) was abandoned a few years ago , so the mentality is `` lets make the most of it while it lasts '' . 
  too bad the cant see deeper into the future . 
  i hear ya bro !, 
  preparing to remove kebab . 
  we were getting ready to remove kebab . 
  greece 1 % ?!?!? 
  given the hardships we are in , i find this 1 % to be very high . 
  thank you dear irish people !, 
  nope it isnt and they wont . 
  that might be a snapshot in time but geopolitic importance is something dynamic and not static . 
  with the imminent creation of a kurdish state in northen iraq & syria , which would defacto be a strong us & israel ally , the islamic turn the turkish society took , the state lybia is in etc none of the above stands anymore . 
  that article was written in 2011 . 
  it 's 2017 .

  here 's the threatening letter turkey send to the un : https://mignatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/turkey-un-letter-n1710207.pdf, 
  does that mean he 's haram for hungary ? 
  you are right . 
  wont happen again . 
  please do accept my apology . 
  do n't lose your hope buddy . 
  best wishes for you . 
  there 's a reason people put / s when they are . 
  if such is the case i do apologise to r/jeanrenimarryme for my remark . 
  we 've had so much name calling , vitriolic cliches , even blatant racism to face all these years that our sense of humour has suffered a bit . 
  oh yes !, 
  especially the ones generalizing like you . 
  history is your witness !, 
  are you sure about that ? 
  you seem to have formed an opinion based on 5 line sentence . 
  i think you can be informed better before coming to such conclusions . 
  never crossed my mind wikipedia was such a revolutionary site !, 
  truly awful !,

  if you wan na look for dishonesty look at the people of fyrom and perhaps your mirror . 
  let me explain . 
  after the region got freed from the ottoman empire it was southern serbia . 
  look at the map : http://alphahistory.com/worldwar1/balkans/ no such nation existed . 
  there were bulgarian population at the region surely . 
  but no one identified himself as belonging to a `` macedonian '' nation . 
  simply cause there is n't one . 
  their language is a testimony to that . 
  but lets not try to prove what 's simply obvious . 
  lets go to the name thing . 
  they themselves claim to be `` macedonians '' . 
  based on what ? 
  on what the geographic name of the region is ? 
  nope !, 
  one would have to be a complete moron and a dishonest hypocrite to claim such a thing . 
  their claim is based on ** ancient macedonia ** and they say they are the heirs of the ancient macedonian tribe . 
  not only they actively support it but they build monuments ( in fact they turned their capital the kitsch capital of the world ) of alexander the great etc. 
  http://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/04/world/europe/macedonia-skopje-2014/ look now on what the territory of ancient macedonia was and if it has anything to do with the territory of their state : http://www.foundalis.com/geo/macedonia.htm if they want to play the `` ancient '' myth thing ( cause they were n't at the region in antiquity , slavs came to the region centuries later ) , then they should name their state paeonia . 
  but hey that would n't stand too as paeonia was inhabited by illyrians ( aka albanians ) . 
  see the map : http://albanopedia.com/en/2016/05/22/illyrian-dynasty-paeonia/ so when it comes to naming their country if they were honest ( you included as you failed to point any of the above ) they should name it fakelandia and be done with it . 
  it 's what that area wall called before tito . 
  anyway it is proven now that their efforts to try and create their own version of history using ultra-nationalistic ways have collapsed . 
  they simply managed not only to have bad relations with their neighbouring countries but also to suppress and alienate one third of the population . 
  just a coincidence . 
  check out the flag used between 1431 and 1619 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:spachides_flag.svg and the flag used from 1769 till the revolution : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:greek_independence_1821.svg, 
  they can call it vardarlandia or vardaristan for all i care . 
  they wont though ... too much nationalistic rhetorics and hatred . 
  for everyone : albanians , greeks even bulgarians too some extent . 
  vmro gets the majority of the vote . 
  why slavomacedonia thought ?? 
  how about the albanians living there ? 
  nope !, 
  vardarska is what it should be . 
  i wouldnt mind calling half of it eastern albania and the other half western bulgaria too . 
  hahahhaha very nice !, 
   thank you !, 
  perhaps we should use the [ old ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/flag_of_greece_%281822-1978%29.svg/800px-flag_of_greece_%281822-1978%29.svg.png ) one again . 
  we have an even [ older ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/greek_independence_1821.svg/600px-greek_independence_1821.svg.png ) one that might be more proper . 
  we 've got plenty to chose from : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_greece, 
  wow !!!, 
  thank you so very much !, 
  ... not !, 
  it 'd be great if there were english subs . 
  exactly !, 
  well at the time they did n't have the best relations . 
  their relations got better after the coup attempt . 
  erdogan even apologised to putin for that . 
  when they shot the russian plane down they had nato on their backs . 
  turns out the only loser from all that was the russian pilot . 
  shows the double speak though . 
  cant built trust that way . 
  before he got the vote and become the prime minister he actively sabotaged everything the previous governments had done .
