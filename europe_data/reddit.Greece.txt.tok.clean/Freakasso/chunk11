  yeah , his regular one was probably in the laundry . 
  good observation , now i ca n't unsee it . 
  you will never have italia !, 
  blue med is best med !, 
  remove baguette !, 
  they can take our money , but they 'll never take our souvlakiaaaaaaa !, 
  dat soviet union tho ... 
  it was the industrial heartland of austria-hungary before it 's dissolution iirc . 
  there 's a minor string attached , you need to reduce your souvlaki consumption by 67 % . 
  white is for purity of soul iirc . 
  this case is considered verbal assault . 
  he would probably get fined for it . 
  none , but he won the heart of mykonos . 
  yes , hypothetically he could be sued . 
  the `` greek racist '' and the `` bangladeshi immigrant '' are both actors . 
  it 's a social experiment to record the bystanders ' reactions . 
  you 're lucky , my mom leeches on my own wi-fi xd, 
  ukrainians are also orthodox ... 
  it 's a ghola . 
  indeed , it 's terrifying to think of how much humanity has lost due to destructive assholes . 
  both inanimate objects and living beings . 
  kids were probably high as fuck thinking they stopped godzilla from multiplying . 
  do you have a moment to talk about our lord and saviour zeus pater ? 
  northern greece is traditionally aligned more to the right and , from personal experience , directly bordering the `` commies '' and the greek civil war have a lot to do with it . 
  p.s we do have a `` bee '' sound but its a diphthong not a letter ( '' \u039c\u03a0 '' ) . 
  maybe we can convince the jihadists to take him along as a mascot or target dummy . 
  wait , you 've never had the [ most amazing event of all ? 
  ] ( https://www.google.gr/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0cacqjrw&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fforum.paradoxplaza.com%2fforum%2fshowthread.php%3f585791-the-obligatory-ck2-strange-screenshot-thread%2fpage291&amp;ei=kx39vpwom8rrapdmgjao&amp;bvm=bv.87611401,d.d2s&amp;psig=afqjcnhfzddjffftaoezyk3upg8gdwdglq&amp;ust=1425985178195057 ), 
  it seems like your heirs discovered `` greek love '' down there . 
   for example , the greek government could still choose to tax you even if you lived abroad ( the us government taxes all its citizens everywhere in the world ) . 
  only if you maintain income or property in greece while abroad . 
  they ca n't directly tax your `` nationality '' . 
  the only string attached is that they can draft you in the army in case there 's war . 
  if i choose to move e.g. 
  to the u.k , my income there will fall under british taxing jurisdiction . 
   the entity that agreed was the democratically elected representatives of the greek people . 
  you 're right , individuals are not serfs to the state ; they are the state . 
  they have the power to elect their representatives , and they carry the responsibility for the actions of those representatives . 
  yes , this argument again ... 
  in hindsight it 's very easy to say that previous greek governments fucked up . 
  in real life the average greek was cheated as much as the creditors were , if not more . 
  unless you believe that we all consciously agreed to bring the country to it 's current state . 
  yes , they were democratically elected but that does not mean that they were transparent or that they worked in the best interests of the people that elected them . 
  technically , the entity that agreed to receive the loans . 
  this is n't the 19th century anymore , individuals are not serfs to the state . 
  if i choose to move out of greece tomorrow the greek debt is no longer my problem . 
  you do realise it does n't work that way , right ? 
  ahhh the joy of not owing anything to anyone . 
  feels so satisfying ( \u0361\u1d54 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u1d54 ), 
  everybody likes bulgarian folk and the gaida . 
  they just do n't know it yet !, 
  greek expressions barely make sense in greek , we have an unfair advantage in this . 
  lol !, 
  we 've figured that out by now , you do n't have to repeat it 3 times a day . 
  i 'm not even mad at the people , most people are simple and believe whatever they are fed . 
  it 's all the media 's fault with their sensationalist headlines and their hate speech . 
  freedom of speech is a double edged sword . 
  my family was also removed from bulgaria . 
  `` today 's topic of discussion in the estonian parliament was poland 's space program . 
  we found it to be insufficient . '', 
   greeks are turks who think they are italians . 
  no , it 's `` it sounds chinese '' . 
  worst os of my life , sucks up a ton of resources and firstborn sons to operate properly . 
  on the other hand , why should cultists and fanatics be endorsed by the state ? 
  how does that help our society to move forward ? 
  there 's a catch behind the concept of `` freedom of religion '' , most of the time it only applies to state recognised religions . 
  what about moony mcmoonface ? 
  you 'll never take me alive poland !, 
  whiteness is subjective but geography is not . 
  all the places you mentioned are geographically in europe . 
  europoor southern headquarters here . 
  i regret to inform you that we can not let our member portugal go . 
  do n't try to change the subject , pay debts !, 
  for a german in the 1700s `` turks and greeks '' probably just meant `` ottomans '' . 
  we do n't , unless we want to be overly pc . 
  i do n't think that 's the only reason in our case though , greece has had both vlach ( eastern romance speakers ) and roma minorities for centuries . 
  on top of that , the history of the danubian principalities ( wallachia , moldavia ) is relevant to the greek war of independence and early modern history and a little bit of it is included in our high school history books . 
  maybe in certain countries , i had no idea that romanians and gypsies get mixed up until the internet `` educated '' me . 
  we need to work on your banter m8 . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  i do it all the time in the shower . 
  it was a total flop . 
  since you brought it up , the traditional independence day dish is [ bakaliaros skordalia ] ( http://www.mygreekdish.com/recipe/cod-fritters-garlicky-potato-puree-bakaliaros-skordalia/ ), 
  come on , admit it , you 're making those up ... 
  joke is r.i.p in peace . 
  i guess the status quo works for them . 
  i like the way cypriot greek sounds , it 's archaic , sexy and has a beautiful rhythm to it . 
  how does standard greek sound to cypriots anyway ? 
  orcs and goblins hate him !, 
  syriza ministers are not exactly known for their eloquence but singling a phrase out of an entire interview to completely twist the context is classic journalistic douchebaggery . 
   oversleeping and eating pig and some people still insist there are n't any common european values . 
  because integration and mixing with other people is against gypsy culture . 
  also they 'd have to give up their farting duels . 
  do n't worry , you 're not alone . 
  you 're thinking of [ myrrh ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chrism ), 
  it 's not like the other side 's politicians have been any more rational or less nationalist . 
  we are not the ones parading phalanxes in front of foreign dignitaries and renaming our stadiums and airports after ancient macedonian monarchs . 
  now i 'm not a qualified physician but a self inflicted sword thrust through the skull is bound to dramatically decrease one 's appetite . 
  tl ; dr lion is kill . 
  that 's a pretty cool story but the guy you 're bashing is a turk from izmir according to his posting history , not a greek .
