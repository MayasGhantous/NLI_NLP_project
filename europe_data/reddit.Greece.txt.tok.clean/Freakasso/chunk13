  our filming set somehow drifted into greek airspace . 
  i 'd pay to watch that . 
  out like turkey xaxaxaxa !, 
  add greece and you have feta !, 
  ^ i 'll ^ show ^ myself ^ out, 
  well most people seem to be convinced that god either exists or does n't , even though neither can prove their position . 
  `` agnostic '' literaly translates to `` one without knowledge '' so yeah , i suppose we 're the yellow people . 
  worst 563 years of my life . 
  depends on the context but yes , we usually refer to latin letters by their english names . 
  and syriza is currently rulling with a 36 % , that 's how multi-party democracies work sometimes . 
  not comparing the two obviously , just saying . 
  no , is tuesday day in rossija . 
  that 's a bit romanticised , it 's more of a generic exclamation . 
  for example if i see somebody about to trip on the pavement i might spontaneously shout '' \u039f\u03a0\u0391 ! '', 
  as in `` watch it ! '', 
  i think `` kratos '' is used in the ancient sense in this context . 
  as in `` great is the strenght of the sea '' . 
  i like how every city is represented by beautiful panoramic shots and sceneries except chania . 
  chania 's biggest attraction is the cretan ordralfabetix . 
  how to download more estonians for free ? 
  it looks similar but no , they are [ worry beads ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/worry_beads ), 
  [ mfw ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/files/022.jpg ), 
  you 'd be surpised . 
  they wake up at 6am to grab the best spots down at the beach . 
  i do n't know how my grandma and her friends do it . 
  we are [ one step ahead of you ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_mediterranean_beach_games ) . 
  ah yes , we had that glorious motto too . 
  it went hand in hand with `` greece of christian greeks '' . 
  [ the bromance is real ] ( https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/guardian/pix/pictures/2015/2/11/1423678232992/alexis-tsipras-and-pablo--009.jpg?w=620&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=cf5095a841a99872ab369d193cd5d122 ), 
  candy crush is a helluva drug . 
  hush now bby , it was just a bad dream . 
  lol !, 
  this one looks like something a greek-american would hang outside their gyros joint . 
  if you ca n't into nordic you can definitely into epilepsy . 
  i did n't say they were , but religion is not the issue here at all . 
  no , not really . 
  my point was that different countries have different reasons to be critical of us leadership . 
  the second most important issue in greece right now ( the most important being the economy of course ) is the situation in syria and the refugee crisis and let 's face it , we 've all , including the us , been handling it really bad . 
  nato opened a bag of shit by inventing some shamefully bad excuses to intervene in the area and pulled out before it was stabilised . 
  saddam 's imaginary wmds was a valid reason to call the entire alliance to arms but aparently isis 's very real raping of the entire region is n't . 
  and orthodoxy is n't some magic glue that binds people and it 's not above politics . 
  ukraine and georgia are orthodox and it did n't prevent any wars with russia . 
  i guess latvia and estonia must be itching to rejoin the ussr by that logic . 
  apparently poland does n't :p, 
  they are not opposed to the existence of a caliphate , as long as they control it . 
  most cities in crimea do have greek names though ( e.g , sevastopol , simferopol ) so you 're not completely wrong . 
  he 's right though , it does taste like feet ... 
  if you were constantly insulted based on your flair alone you 'd be triggered too . 
  hell i 'm 1.82 and i often struggle with bus sitting space being too confined and bathroom mirrors and sinks being too low . 
  i do n't envy you 1.90 + people at all . 
  i knew they had stores in neighboring countries but ... 
  mayotte ?? 
  there must be an interesting story behind this . 
  `` chic '' is french . 
  [ me too ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/flag_of_palaeologus_dynasty.svg ), 
  this is an anthem i can relate to . 
  they 're not locked in here with us , we 're locked in here with them !, 
  ooh la la !, 
  i once saw a number but i ate it . 
  i would let them touch my macedonia any day ... 
  it 's not a proper crusade unless you grab some greek clay on your way there . 
  first order of business : restore the knights hospitaller in the holy land !, 
  oh stop it you !, 
  oh shit me too ... 
  trust no one , the turk is out there . 
  just make sure it 's a chocolate trifle and that girly strawberry shite . 
  we do n't want the aliens to think us soft . 
  is this what happens when tortellini and dumplings love each other very much ? 
  i said country :p, 
  what was the pig 's sexual orientation ? 
  well then the whole thread is pointless because no country had stabilised into their modern borders in 900 ad, 
  phat clouds \\ \\ / / \\, 
  i 'm obviously being sarcastic , but seriously now , how much sterilisation is too much ? 
  what if somebody does n't identify as a passenger and they get triggered ? 
  we should ban all words just to be safe imo . 
  i hope we 're still talking olives here ... 
  it needs a couple more hours on the spit and plenty of lemon , we 'll fix it for you !, 
  should we prepare the asylum applications for the rest of their army or will they be bringing their own ? 
  i 'm pretty sure we invented that too . 
  yeah , and the only thing stopping them was that they did n't know the greek word for cyka . 
  now we 're fucked . 
  the difference between castro and junta is that the junta respected private property and people did n't have to queue up for stale bread and toilet paper . 
  if i had to choose between 2 evils i know what i 'd go for . 
  hahahaha we basically use `` kalo kouragio '' in the exact same way `` i feel kinda bad about you but at least it 's not me '', 
  awkward thrice kissers should be banned !, 
  two is the norm . 
  same etiquette here with a `` yia/yia sas '' instead . 
  due to the fact that we do n't control the full 12 nautical miles around some of our border islands ( [ it 's an ongoing dispute ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aegean_dispute ) ) the closest landmass in 99.9 % of cases is in fact greece . 
  we are talking about distances short enough to swim across if you 're desperate , not the pacific ocean . 
  plus there 's the issue of having to deal with sultan gollum across the aegean , not the most reasonable person . 
  the navy is out there but as soon as they get approached by the navy or coast guard they puncture their boats . 
  also bear in mind that there are no international waters between turkey and greece in the places where they choose to make landfall , so they 're either in turkish waters where our navy can not enter or in our waters where the navy has to abide by international laws and pick them up because they 're technically shipwrecked . 
  the issue at hand is legal/ethical , no matter how many ships you throw at them they are still able to cross . 
  they are in a better place with god , free of latvian oppression . 
  and that 's why you got rich , you do n't get high on your own supply . 
  jesus just got 10 feet taller !, 
  what if albania is n't real ? 
  soon . 
  then the winged hussars arrived !, 
  so they do n't get any at home .
