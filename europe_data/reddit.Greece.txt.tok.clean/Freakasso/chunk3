  i do n't think it 's socially unacceptable in any eu country . 
  i do n't know about other countries but in greece unmarried young people tend to stay with their family or with a roomate/bf/gf to share expenses . 
  that goes for both genders . 
  it 's just a cute term for `` bribe '' . 
  you do n't have to put them in an actual fakelaki xd do you have to bribe for extra tzatziki in germany ? 
  and the communists were backed by yugoslavia and the ussr , it was pretty much the first proxy-war of the cold war era . 
  while the rest of europe was rebuilding we were shooting each other . 
  i do n't think you read the article . 
  that 's a german journalist 's opinion , not a statement by samaras . 
  it 's not even about the economy , it 's about reforms on the public sector . 
  the title is absolutely misleading . 
  that kind of mentality requires education ... 
  first world problems . 
  wait ... if germany is permanently wasted , who 's driving the eu-mobile ? 
  til i 'm not a true macedonian . 
  you 've just single-handedly restored my appreciation to the greek orthodox church . 
  aleksandar makedonski alive in fyrom making fast removal of gyros !, 
  it 's funny because it 's true :p we 've always had a `` yolo '' mentality when it came to money . 
  i think his main issue was that the greek communist party lost the civil war and he had a nato country , with a sizeable minority in southern albania , breathing down his neck . 
  he was probably afraid that greece would try to pull a cyprus in southern albania and you ca n't realy blame him . 
  but he had to walk a fine line between blaming the greek government and blaming the greeks in general , because that would enrage a part of his own people . 
  have you ever read [ that ] ( https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hoxha/works/ebooks/two_friendly_peoples.pdf ) btw ? 
  interestingly enough , the golden dawn also publiced something similar at the time , about how greeks and albanians are a single race and albanians are being misled by communist propaganda . 
  probably to justify the fact that a lot of their member are arvanites . 
  greek-albanian relations is a huge fucking mess . 
  jan pawel ii is rolling in his grave right now . 
  i agree with all your points actualy . 
  i was just pointing out that :  while turkey has mostly coast - like many other european countries - and its position would n't create security issues it 's not as simple as that . 
  maybe he just wants a hug ... 
  err no , look at the map again . 
  turkey borders syria , iraq , iran and the caucasus ( which russia considers within it 's area of influence ) . 
  and then there 's also the kurds . 
  i 'd say it 's one of the most unstable areas in the world right now , if not ** the ** most unstable . 
  they probably think i 'm trolling because of the sex part . 
  but i 'm not . 
  yes , it might totaly be surprise byzantium in disguise \u25d1 . \u25d1, 
  exactly , also due to the [ dublin regulation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dublin_regulation ) you 'll have to deal with most middle eastern illegal immigrants instead of us . 
  greece is nr1 fanboy of turkey 's eu prospect . 
  i knew you were always the sweet talkers in the neighborhood . 
  screw you , i laughed so hard at this my whole body hurts . 
  not realy , you can easily tell a bulgarian from an albanian by their facial bone structure . 
  still this is irrelevant because :  languages and cultures transcend ethnicities . 
  this . 
  which still does n't mean that you can claim to be whatever you want and i have to accept it though . 
  i can confirm your side of the story . 
  my favourite part in the comments was : ** fake account with greek name ** `` i am greek ... but my neighbors macedonians need to understand that this man mr. georgievski is a traitor . 
  everyone in the balkans deserves their identity equally , we here in greece have many parasites like this man who are corrupt and also greatly responsible for the downfall of greece . 
  hang all of these bastards !, 
  this idiot was more than likely given money under the table to speak his stupid ideas . 
  trust me . '', 
  ** typical greek youtube warrior ** `` if you are greek talk to me greek but in the greeklish way '' * ( note : greeklish is a way of typing greek with latin characters , there is no google translate for that . 
  ) * ** fake account with greek name ** `` lol what does that even mean ? 
  the greeklish way ? 
  whatever he tried to say in greek roughly translates to : `` what do you want me to tell you ? 
  i 'm sutting now and drinking the my morning coffee , and ? 
  wihat else to tell you ? 
  four an hor previous i was sit ing in the loo and made shits '' this is pure commedy gold , people have too much free time in their habds . 
  close enough but one correction , di - is the greek prefix and bi - is the latin one . 
  so the pure forms are `` diglot '' and `` bilingual '' . 
  you got your classical languages mixed up a bit :p, 
  repression of emotions only leads to living on antidepressants in the long run , i know this first hand . 
  arguing for no reason sounds absurd but once you get into that mentality you realise it 's a cathartic experience . 
  plus it makes sex much better . 
  oh come on , that 's a nice church :p i mean i 'm not very religious myself but i do appreciate some nice byzantine architecture . 
  i guess albanians are still suspicious towards greeks because of the whole northen epirus/chameria border disputes and our good relations with serbia ? 
  to be honest there used to be a lot of albanian haters in greece 20 years ago but now it 's a very rare occurrence . 
  if you 're using greek history books it makes sense . 
  remove kebab/balkan wars and venizelos ' shenanigans in ww1 which also make a significant part of that book are also irrelevant to you i guess . 
  they both sent priests and founds the reopen/rebuild churches and restore their influence . 
  greek history books emphasize mostly on the classical period , byzantium and the war of independence ( 1821 ) . 
  nothing is realy `` swept under the rug '' but i guess our history books have a very different scope compared to western europe 's . 
   emphasised : 1821 greek war of independence ( that did n't actually involved cyprus in a direct way ) holy crap seriously ? 
  i feel your pain , that must be awfully boring to you . 
  we let you manage them for us !, 
  they will after they finish rioting for 7-1 . 
  yeah i know about the immigrants , i was just wondering if it 's any different in albania itself , because i also know that after the communist regime colapsed , both the catholic and the orthodox churches fell on albania like birds of prey . 
  the only albanian friend of mine that i felt confortable asking about the situation just replied `` i was never baptised , i do n't realy care '' . 
   i doubt we 're gon na be a muslim-majority population for long , the number of muslim people is going down . 
  is that because of atheism or people converting to christianity ? 
  sure , one more ca n't hurt . 
  [ crap ... ] ( http://treasure.diylol.com/uploads/post/image/613819/resized_horrorcat-meme-generator-omg-hes-back-3d7806.jpg ), 
  russia , because they have an actual army and they are the no1 producer of oil and natural gas . 
  also they will conquer the rest of the world for us . 
  if turkey never showed up we would have had the old one :p 200 years after the break-up and we 're still at court for the custody of the children . 
  the ones that brought misery to eastern europe believed in neither . 
  we refuse . 
  nah , do n't worry it 's a common condition . 
  i recommend more paradox games . 
  i call dibs on the uninhabited land between greece and romania . 
  i promise to be a kind and just king . 
  1 ) you are lazy and poor , pay debts . 
  2 ) ancient greece is dead , you are a greek-speaking turks . 
  3 ) alexander best slav ever , macedonia stronk !, 
  4 ) how are you even replying ? 
  you have internet in greece ? 
  our jimmies are easily rustled lately indeed ... 
  it 's solun in bulgarian btw . 
  and selanik in turkish if you feel like being an even bigger bastard . 
  this is going to be like these akward family reunions ... are they gon na have winged hussars too ? 
  yes , those 3 days in july are incredible !,
