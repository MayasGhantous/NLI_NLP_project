  western turkey and greece are practicaly identical , we just feel unconfortable admitting it , ok ? 
  that 's the official greek proposition and what we all want but aparently greeks have to prove that we are not elephants on a daily basis . 
  that 's useful to know , thanks !, 
  i feel your pain bro :(, 
  the dolphin has been considered a sacred animal in greece since ancient times and since we are a marine nation i believe it represents us quite well . 
  alt ideas : seagull , owl ( that 's more of an athenian symbol though ) . 
  gypsy detected , activate perimeter defence !, 
  our 's is the smallest :( but we 've got broseidon on our side aparently . 
  high five bro !, 
  we tend to look up to teams rather than individual players/athletes most of the time : 1 . 
  football - obvious choice here is the team that won euro 2004 in portugal . 
  basketball - the first team that comes to mind is the 1987 one , that won fiba eurobasket in a nerve-wracking final against the soviet union . 
  volleyball/water polo - not gon na lie , i 'm not entirely sure about 3rd place :p . track and field sports are also quite popular , likewise wrestling ( greco-roman and freestyle ) sports that people like to play change according to the season , even though football ( mostly 5v5 ) is king all year long but in summer people go crazy over beach volleyball and beach rackets ( most annoying sport in history ) . 
  cranes , ladders and a lot of faith . 
  or [ this ] ( http://www.9ori.com/blog/media/images/c0344d40b7.jpeg ), 
  free peaches ??!, 
  that 's all i ever dreamt of and more !, 
  that 's exactly what is going on . 
  if the usa and nato bite the bait they can get their confirmation that `` the west is the devil '' . 
  on the other hand if they do n't act they are `` weak and scared of mighty allah '' . 
  it 's a win-win propaganda campaign in their minds . 
  i know it 's a tradition and part of the culture but ... torturing animals to death in front of a crowd in 2014 ? 
  `` put that down !, 
  it 's still attached to me ! '', 
  the pic is from a maternity ward , they need a lot of protein to lactate . 
  it 's not as expensive as it looks anyway , it 's more or less what i eat for lunch everyday :p, 
  hey kid , wan na buy some delicious oranges ? 
  if you survive your condition , we will [ feed you to death ] ( http://www.pmslweb.com/the-blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/greek-food.jpg ) ca n't have you occupying that bed forever son !, 
  and why does everyone in greece use that tray ? 
  it 's driving me crazy !, 
  i 'm a used piece of paper and i find that insulting .

  greek is full of colloquialisms realy ... i could write a book . 
  now somebody please do cypriot , they are even better :d, 
   nie udawaj greka ( do n't pretend to be greek ) but i am :(, 
  that 's the first thing that caught my eye as well !, 
  eesti can not into mountains . 
  but then again , it 's almost impossible to find a landscape in greece without them . 
  also worth a note , since it might be relatively unknown outside the orthodox community , is the autonomous monastic state of mt.athos in northern greece . 
  home to 2000 monks from around the world and in possesion of an astounding amount of medieval relics and other treasures .

   gay far-right jew nazi white supremacist real madrid fan supporting the kyiv-nazis . 
  there . 
  heh , nazi bashing never gets old . 
  there was also a series of short sketches on an old greek show with a very similar concept, 
  i can understand the context it was witten in but it 's still not a valid reason to outlaw a political party . 
  the only way to crush extremists is by demoratic means , because whether a neo-nazi party is allowed to operate or not , people that have had nothing but incompetend politicians leading them for the last 40 years will eventualy take the law in their hands . 
  where do we draw the line on which ideology is accepted and which one is not ? 
  the left-wing people that celebrate for the persecutions of the golden dawn leaders do not realise that tomorow it will be them and then we might as well adopt the `` best korea '' model and spare us the hussle of having to decide on whom to vote for . 
   the leaders of these 14 parties express a wide range of political views , from finely nuanced bigotry to misogyny to adoration of fascist heroes of world war ii . 
  ** at least eight of them are pro-russian . 
  ** wait what ? 
  is the author realy comparing misogyny and fascist ideology to pro-russian sentiments ? 
  did they not get the memo that the cold war is over ? 
  tilt your head to the left . 
  i 'm warning you though ... can not be unseen . 
  +1 the grand master 's palace is so well preserved you can hardly believe it 's 700 years old . 
  if they ever shoot an assassin 's creed movie it 's the perfect setting . 
  my fondest memory of rhodes . 
  too late for that , poland already joined . 
  those look similar to our loukoumades , also sold by street vendors around fairs etc. 
  but with honey and cinnamon on top . 
  i think they also make them in turkey . 
  it all started when zeus got word of the amazing nightlife in cyprus ... 
  never heard of that 0 . o i do n't see the point but oh well ... 
  classical greek architecture is meant to be more simplistic though . 
  the austrian parliament looks like a greek-american taverna !, 
  i 'm not 100 % certain but it may be based on their [ municipal flag 's ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:thessaloniki_municipal_flag.png ) colouring scheme . 
  * `` the gods have never forgiven us since we stupidly invaded sicily . 
  '' * i bet there was something very fishy in this guy 's pie . 
  those neo-pagans come up with the weirdest stuff . 
  yeah , that would probably give me a panic attack : /, 
  i think we need to work on your circlejerking , 
  a kagouras in his natural habitat , beautiful . 
  more like , western culture was shaped by these guys 2000 + years ago . 
  if you think about it this way it makes more sense , there is a direct continuation . 
  [ the garamantes ] ( http://www.livius.org/articles/place/garamantes/ ) . 
  they were semi-nomadic , hence the question marks next to their settlements . 
  edirne is in europe , tell them they made it . 
  to be fair that 's 150 more cases investigated than his predecessors who `` lost '' the list :p and that 's an indication of how screwed we are . 
  i 'm in no way a syriza or left wing apologist but people should stop expecting the impossible . 
  people with influence and connections , politicians or otherwise , will use it in favor of their families . 
  in the grand scheme of things as long as he does n't create another siemens or submarine scandal that costs us a few billions i do n't give a fuck about his wife getting a job that nets around 1.6 k/month , for which she is qualified anyway . 
  time will tell if he 's really corrupt or not . 
  there are no moderate pastafarians . 
  you know nothing , landlubber . 
  diabeetus . 
  we know but aparently they do n't . 
   100k people closer to 400k by now and that 's the official number , there could be more that made it through undetected . 
  and this is why the law is not being enforced , we just do n't have the capacity to persecute almost half a million people unless we declare martial law . 
  behead those who insult pasta !,
