  and you can keep us after the five year period has expired . 
  in return you can use greek history as your own and no one can ever mock you again , it 's win-win . 
  you can justify your hate for people you 've never met anyway you like , it 's still hate . 
  btw i never implied that certain greeks do n't feel hate , but i guess it 's easier for you to think of countries as tetris blocks . 
  blind hate always returns to the sender . 
  i guess people have learned nothing out of their own history . 
  i use my debit card to pay for literally everything over 20 $ . 
  the facilities are there , people are just reluctant to use them .

  but i wanted peanuts :(, 
  and the emergency property tax that was supposed to be a one time thing . 
  they were making about 4 billion a year from that alone . 
  it 's not prohibited actually , it 's fine as long as they are chambered for the standard nato ammunition . 
  is this the elusive efi thodish dialect i 've been hearing about ? 
  the patron saint of patras is st.andrew ( agios andreas ) if i 'm not mistaken . 
  it 's true , before the turks came the greek cuisine consisted of rocks , grass and babies . 
  actually people in the past 2000 years did all of the aforementioned things , including straight up bombing the parthenon a couple of times . 
  it 's the same in athens . 
  if you 're standing on the left side you risk getting rammed by the fast and the furious .

  hahahaha , you 're a terrible actor . 
  my first reaction when syriza was elected was something along the lines of `` god help us '' ( yes , i got downvoted to tartarus ) , it 's not that i trusted the previous government more , i was just terrified at how eager they were to lose the elections . 
  so you 're the one stashing all the euromonies away ... 
  that 's an insult to special olympics athletes , their mental capacity is way higher . 
  why does everything have to be so complicated in polish ? 
  are you guys doing it on purpose ? 
  there 's also \u03c7\u03b10\u03c7\u03b10\u03c7\u03b10 which is used in trollish situations .

  too young . 
  that is apparent . 
  thank god for your relatives , the only hard working people in greece / s, 
  catalonia does not exist in the game , you 're thinking of the kingdom of aragon or the duchy ( county irl ) of barcelona . 
  you mean there are more playable kingdoms in the game ? 
  i thought it was a reclaim rightful roman clay simulator :o, 
  finally we 'll be free of these southern rednecks !, 
  no no , you do n't banish female relatives from the realm unless they are past childbirth age . 
  you do n't want them spawning bastard claimants all over europe , just blind them and keep them as a pet . 
  according to my 7 year old niece their school has given them a number to call in case they get abused at home and she also warned us that it 's illegal and they are going to put us in jail if it happens . 
  i guess i 'll have to comply officer \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af,

   just thessalonica jews constituted 1/3 of the city 's population and that 's the main reason why they could n't be concealed like in other places : / most of them barely spoke greek .

  yes , we are saying the same thing . 
  they watched the series and they got interested in the real people the series were based on . 
  i do n't find it that embarrassing tbh ... 
  ottoman history is nowhere near as embarrassing as justin bieber :p, 
  nah , some people actually find his songs catchy :p, 
  yes but what i mean to say is that they specialize in firearms , eas does not specialize in a particular field and that makes them way less efficient . 
  i think it 's a `` lost in translation '' thing . 
  what we call pita gyros/d \u00f6ner kebab is a ** type ** of sandwich , what they call d\u00f6ner kebab in the rest of europe is a ** particular ** sandwich that was first made in berlin by a turkish immigrant . 
  that 's the way i understand it , i might be wrong though . 
  eas is pretty much the entire defence industry in greece though , they also produce all kinds of ammunition and spare parts . 
  800 people does n't sound so over the top . 
  an average private factory in athens ' industrial area employs around 350 people .

  polandball posting history can and will be used against you in a court of law .

  even if we go back to the drachma the debt wo n't be written off . 
  and it will have to be repaid in euros not drachmas . 
  i 'm actually the exact opposite , lazy and efficient . 
  unemployment , which is a much greater burden than austerity , is not entirely a result of the bailout . 
  it 's the result of governments shitting on the private sector for the last 30 years or so . 
  sounds like the excuses i would try on my mom when i was 7 lol . 
  well according to their patches they are [ u\u00c7k ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kosovo_liberation_army ) . 
  it 's still worrying that they are stirring up shit in the region again though . 
  oh i did n't mean they were relocated there by force , just that they are in the middle of a war zone right now . 
  this is why we became romans .
