  shooting in urban areas is not very smart though . 
  you 'll have to go obelix on them . 
  i just do n't see the point of the downvote button in a moderated forum . 
  it only encourages hiveminding and mob mentality . 
  i prefer the polandball model . 
  it 's the same way everyone speculates that all greeks suddenly fell for a `` populist radical leftist '' party while in reality syriza is rulling with a 36 % . 
  people often think and comment in terms of their own countries . 
  i 've never seen fish served like that in greece but greek salad ( we call it country/villager 's salad ) is indeed the most common type of salad here . 
  what is this ? 
  an ancient recipe for crunchy wings ? 
  but since they do n't have foreskins they 're gon na have to keep importing anyway . 
  only if you promise you 'll drink coke light . 
  mods are asleep , post ~ ~ cats ~ ~ [ deratization crews ] ( https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8093/8515614554_8676d27e03_b.jpg ), 
  we need to put you on a diet before you start spilling over to other clays again ( \uff9f\u0434\uff9f \uff1b ), 
  it 's not that they liked kemal , they had plans to divide anatolia between themselves like they did with the rest of the empire and smyrna/izmir was too big of a prize . 
  it 's well known that the italians were collaborating with kemal to throw the greeks out . 
  italian and french . 
  german euros are simply majestic . 
  ( no pun intended ), 
  and she 's riding zeus . 
  illuminati confirmed . 
  featuring turkey as the intergalactic empire of the rising sun !, 
  most pointless campaign in modern greek history . 
  even if it were n't for kemal the western powers would have thrown us out of anatolia anyway . 
  i feel you bro ... how high did you go ? 
  somebody actually downvoted you for this lol !, 
  / r/greece habits are spilling :p, 
  that 's too complicated for me to answer here but tl ; dr depends on the kind of gyros . 
  ( you 're not eating fries without gyros like a pleb are you ? ), 
  people that judge you as a representative of your country instead of an individual because of your flair are not worth the fuss m8 , 
   '' \u03c0\u03b9\u03ac\u03b5 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 '' i 'm going to take a wild guess that there 's a \u03b4 somewhere in there that you 're not pronouncing :p, 
  wrong sub comrade , our evil lair is that way -- , 
  you 're just jelly because he 's 1/32 cherokee and you are n't . 
  once you go kebab there is no way back , only saddings . 
  such is life in the former ottoman empire . 
  im sure they 'd love that . 
  they 're still using the aks from nato 's last disarmament . 
  this time they 'll probably end up with nukes !, 
  the point is that everything has a pricetag attached . 
  it 's the monk class questing area , only you never get to leave it unless you reroll . 
  why are we not funding this ? 
  tolerance to stomach-turning stuff is a useful combat skill . 
  the army always knows best , never doubt the army !, 
  ^ ^ is ^ ^ what ^ ^ my ^ ^ sergeant ^ ^ would ^ ^ have ^ ^ said, 
  judging by your username you might have the wrong idea about their usefulness ( \u00b4 \uff65 _ \uff65 ` ), 
  unemployment coincides with radical ideologies in general . 
  same here , they do n't even need to run recruitment campaigns . 
  if you can cope with the fact that you may be stationed in some pretty dead places it 's a good career . 
  how is it forced labour when they are getting paid for it ? 
   believe me that greece is still very okay when you compare it to the 3rd world . 
  but if corruption and lack of reforms continue like this , that could change . 
  i really hope people wake up and start blaming the actual culprits . 
  true and true . 
  and my argument stands . 
  working in 3rd world countries with a western european wage does not make you an expert on greek work ethics . 
  let me give you my pov : i translate technical documents , i 'd like to believe that i 'm decent at what i do but i 'm also willing to bet that there are thousands of people waiting in line for my job if i fuck up or start wanking about and missing deadlines . 
  since i 'm on a limited duration contract , my employer can lay me off without compensation and without me getting any welfare , including health insurance , until i 'm re-employed . 
  if my boss tells me to jump , i ask `` how high '' . 
  that said , i 'm not realy complaining , i 'm fairly well paid and content with my job . 
  i could probably work abroad in better conditions but i chose to stay ... for now . 
  no , i did n't get your cv , but unless you 've lived and worked in greece or spain you have n't experienced anything similar . 
  unless you went to look for work in kosovo or you happen to be old enough to have witnessed the great crash firsthand . 
  you have no idea how easy it is to get fired and replaced in a country with 27 % unemployment do you ? 
  but you 're a bit out of context . 
  then i 'd have to rek u m8 . 
  or simply because the permians are genetically fenno-ugric ? 
  we have a saying in greece that roughly translates to `` the soul leaves the body easier than habits do '' . 
  the oe was in decline way before ww1 , partly because of stagnation and partly because of the european powers supporting seperatist movements among the christian population . 
  it begun with the serbs in the late 18th century . 
  the notion that the sultan was against the partition of the commonwealth because turks loved poles is just romanticism . 
  because the ottoman empire was up next for partition . 
  [ european people 's party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_people%27s_party ), 
  national pride aside , when you have zero chance to win a war or cause considerable damage , surrendering is the sane choice . 
  a lot of countries did it . 
  the irony is that france did n't , they just got outwitted . 
  somebody ban him for trolling already ... 
  attic greek almost exclusively reffers to the ionian dialect spoken in classical athens . 
  what we call `` athenian greek '' is officialy called `` standard modern greek '' and evolved from koine . 
  they are a few thousand years apart :p, 
  attic greek is the standard ? 
  pericles is that you ? 
  our ultra-orthodoxy broke the scale . 
  i had to use a [ map ] ( http://www.pennebianche.com/cyclades.gif ) , because the cyclades are confusing . 
  til that tinos has a catholic majority . 
  i think it was a gypsy joke :p, 
  lol !, 
  drink and auto correct do n't mix well . 
  i 've done worse :p, 
  you deserve a fucking metal for this . 
  no worries , bad mood happens , 
  the most common slang word in greek is `` puli '' ( bird ) actualy . 
  errr ... 
  i did n't blame turkey . 
  i 'm sorry for getting you mad , it was n't my intention . 
  it 's just that everytime there 's a topic about the balkans it 's always the same thing `` but they started it '' . 
  it 's like these old family feuds that go on for so long that people forget what they are fighting about but they keep fighting anyway . 
  the truth is that every country followed almost the exact same policies and did what they had to do to survive . 
  and just for historicity 's sake , there was never a treaty between greece and bulgaria . 
  the treaty was between bulgaria and serbia . 
  the treaty of london itself is very vague .
