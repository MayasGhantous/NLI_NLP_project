  take a look at gdp per capita ppp https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp ) _ per_capita on average someone from lithuania can afford more even though the salary is less . 
  also we pay different tax for a lot of things . 
  for example take a look at gasoline : http://www.globalpetrolprices.com/lithuania/gasoline_prices/ http://www.globalpetrolprices.com/greece/gasoline_prices/ the price in greece is significantly higher , because we have special gasoline tax , etc. . 
  in 2015 greek poverty line was 665 euro per month . 
  personally opinion . 
  people who have a job in greece can afford a standard of living that is better than bulgaria or romania . 
  the problem is that there are so many people unemployed ( ~ 25 % ) that literally do not make any money at all . 
  the bottom 20 % of bulgaria and romania probably can afford a better standard of living that the bottom 20 % of greece but otherwise greek people have better standard of living . 
  he talked about it in this interview : http://www.alphatv.gr/shows/informative/aftopsia/webtv/giorgos-papakonstantinoy, 
  in greece they just do n't hire people who have not completed their military service . 
  it is the most basic requirement for men to find a job . 
  i do n't think self-driving car will be talking to each other . 
  what if one car is lying ( hacked to cause an accident on purpose ) ? 
  no idea , but i guess these families are going to stay in greece/europe for a long time ( 5 years + ) . 
  they should learn at the very least the greek language as soon as possible if we want them to integrate . 
  from a quick search on the internet i found an article that says , the law requires all children to be vaccinated for a number of diseases with a severe punishment for both doctors and parents in case of no vaccination . 
  i guess mass vaccination of children immigrants should be hard now , since schools have started and the government was not prepared for it . 
  no matter how much they are going to stay in greece ( let 's say 6 months ) children can not just stay somewhere and do nothing all day . 
  i 've read also that immigrants are not going to attend regular classes , but they are going to use the same classrooms regular students are using . 
  for example regular student will use the classrooms from 08:00 - 14:00 and refugees from 16:00 and later . 
  the reason they are protesting is because of deceases / lack of vaccination of the refugees . 
  tv says the reason they are protesting is because these children are not vaccinated , or they might carry viruses that do not exist in greece , and thus putting their children in danger . 
  i do not know how much of that statement is true , but a few refugees ( 4 or 5 ) did in fact carry malaria ( greece was malaria free for many years ) . 
  thank you for the explanation . 
  i live in greece . 
  if i buy something online from a company in china and its costs more than 22 $ , the chinese company needs to pay vat in greece ? 
  the chinese company also needs to pay vat in china ? 
  ioannis kapodistrias ( greek national ) was the foreign minister of russian empire in 1820s . 
  russian empire was on of the countries that helped greece during the war of independence ( the others were france and uk ) against the ottoman empire , and ioannis kapodistrias latter became the first president of greece . 
  one of the reasons the tsar of russia decided to help greece was because greek were orthodox the same religion as russians , and the citizens or russia pressured the tsar to help greece . 
  we do n't have rt here . 
  greeks always considered russians a friend . 
  cyprus has conscription for 14 months , but only 54 % trust the military . 
  i do n't think it is really related . 
  what she said was that if they see a norwegian woman in a miniskirt they will not say anything bad at them , but if they see a middle eastern woman in a miniskirt they will say she is a whore . 
  i think the practices you are referring to apply only to illegal immigrants and not refugees . 
  the cost for the classes is extremely small for the government compared to the other costs ( housing , money for food , etc. . ) . 
  also one refugee basically said that these classes are very important for them , or norway will end up in a situation where the muslims in the future will demand sharia from the government . 
  i think what the woman from qatar said was , `` you can teach men to respect norwegian women but you can not teach men to respect middle eastern women '' , or `` men will be afraid of disrespecting norwegian women but not middle eastern women '' also she was from qatar , i think syrians have different culture . 
  you are the first person i have ever heard saying that . 
  i am not a lawyer maybe you are right . 
  they tried to overthrow the government , which is very illegal in greece as well . 
  ( if they actually took part in the coup ), 
  i think it was a joke . 
  us has bases everywhere in the world , this 3.4 % is not spend only for nato ( europe - us ) , but also for japan , taiwan , etc. . . 
  when eu countries spend money on military the money go for the defense of nato ( europe ) . 
  also greece and turkey use military conscription , in greece each conscript gets a symbolic salary of 8 euros ( ~ 6 pounds ) per month , and the time spend on the army does not count for pension either . 
  so greece spends 2,4 % of gdp in army plus has free conscripts , i would argue greece for example spends really really more money than the us for nato as % . 
  ( i think the us figure also includes pensions to us veterans ), 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/league_of_nations basically the united nations before world war 2, 
  i think from modern greece ioannis kapodistrias should be the greatest . 
  i do n't think russian orthodoxs are 2/3 of all orthodoxs . 
  i think there are in total 300 million orthodox christians and in russia around 25-30 % of the total population of ~ 150million people are christian orthodoxs . 
  i think the joke is the pattern us ** a ** us ** b ** us ** c ** us ** d ** us ** e ** abcde, 
  i guess not . 
  greece for example is not a secular state , and i believe if the same question would be asked in greece , the percentage of people who would like to keep the orthodox christianity as a state religion would much higher than 20 % , that does n't mean these people are religious nutters . 
  un membership, 
  you forgot albania . 
  opinions are not fake news . 
  this is an example of [ fakes news ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4x0ylr/the_romanians_shown_in_the_sky_news_video/d6bk27b ), 
  we also have it in greece . 
  what do you mean ? 
  i do n't get it, 
  i 've heard they only allow female cats because cats kill mice . 
  about the women refugees , i do n't think they allowed them to stay , rather because they only reached the mountain by chance and not on purpose they forgave the refugees for going to the mountain , but still kicked them out . 
  wtf ? 
  is n't that a suicide from the government ? 
  people protesting , many lost voters , etc. . ? 
  i am not a lawyer , but i think the law is like that because young people do not understand their actions . 
  there have been cases in the past where children as young as 6 years old have killed their baby siblings . 
  i do not think nothing will happen . 
  probably he will be asked to see a psychologist for some years or something like that etc. . 
  100 % agree with you . 
  there are laws that dictate what the punishment for a theft is . 
  `` but he is a shady person '' is no excuse . 
  it 's the same in many countries . 
  i think as long as you are under 13 years old `` you are above the law '' . 
  but i think the parents can be charged and the child will go to under the protection of the state ( orphanage or something like that ) . 
  i 've also seen in tv that in many countries criminals use children for drug delivery because they can not be charged . 
  i used to climb 10 meter tall trees ( roughly the same height as a 3 floor building ) when i was 12 year old . 
  now the idea of me climbing the tree gets me frightened . 
  i wonder how old he will be next year . 
  the comment about fingerprints was added by the op , not the newspaper . 
  there is a chance the op is wrong about that . 
  when i got my passport the greek police registered my fingerprint electronically . 
  if the police require fingerprints to issue a passport , i am sure the police has a database with all the fingerprints of all criminals . 
  i also guess the police shared this person 's fingerprints with the other ( eu ) countries since he was a fugitive since he did not report to the local police station . 
  but what good does it do ? 
  even if germany has this person fingerprints in a database it is not like they can find him/arrest him , unless by chance . 
  i think it is expected that they would come out against backdoor . 
  that is because enisa is an eu agency and not a national government 's agency . 
  if enisa came in favor of backdoors or engaged in surveillance it would mean all european member states know about it and are `` okay '' with their citizens spied and the data of their citizens available to all eu member states . 
  the first picture needs `` you came to the wrong neighborhood , motherfucker '', 
  japan stopped the production of energy from nuclear factories for a long time after the tsunami in 2011 . 
  actually the whole story is suspicious as fuck , it is also discussed in the greek subreddit . 
  the victim is a half greek half australian , the tv and cameras happened to be there just after the attackers left , the attackers hit him at ermou street , the most populous street in greece in the noon but there were no witnesses except for his family . 
  also he was the only person to be attacked , even though a lot more people also went shopping on sunday . 
  i 'm not saying the tourist is lying but it appears there are more to this story .
