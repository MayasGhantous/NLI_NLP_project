first of all thank you for the correction on the horseshoe theory . 
  as for the * conspiracy theory * i 'm * developing * here ( self sarcasm ) , of course i do n'texpect such evidences to occur . 
  i just believe that if more people could see such connections , which of course could be coincidences , maybe such crimes would n't be so often . 
  actually something like this would benefit the government as well : troika is coming the next days demanding new austerity measures , a big strike is scheduled in wednesday , most of the pm samaras consultants such as failos kranidiotis are friendly towards golden dawn , voridis with such far right past and connections to really dirty circles is to be the next header in new democracy party while in his party voices are raised against the new bill about taxing the property . 
  same perfect timing had fyssas murder and that starts to seem too convenient . 
  oh , and do n't forget the famous theory of the two edges , now that syriza is going up in polls and the coalition government do n't know how many days has left ... 
  my mother worked at the choir . 
  all the music ensembles are in question . 
  samaras said among others in his speech about the lazy non working crew of ert that the music ensembles gave 3 performances per year . 
  this of course is a blatant lie . 
  they gave 3 performances per week open to audience that where live in the 3rd program of the radio broadcast plus at least two or three performance per month in megaron , herodeon and other theaters or halls in athens , others cities in greece and abroad . 
  music ensembles of ert are one of the most important institutions of classical calture in nowdays greece , but it does n't fit to a program that wants people brought up only with bouzouki culture of the 80 's pasok . 
  yes , state should make the rules , i agree . 
  to have a cultural organization non profit orianted and still able to fund itself is exaclty this . 
  it 's completely irrational just because we have to deal with our legal system to close the only legal tv station which by the way played a significant role into the greek culture ( 3 tv channels , 3 radio broadcasts , a huge historical digital archive of documentaries , old greek films , theater performances , the first greek tv series , 3 orchestras , a choir ) . 
  privatisation is n't the answer to everything , sorry we disagree . 
  no , it could n't . 
  every private station here is corrupted as fuck . 
  ert had actually the only legal tv station permission ( that means that the state 's income have no profit from their taxes among other losses ) . 
  on the other hand , a healthy organization could still exist , without gaining a huge surplus . 
  stop confusing economics with politics , culture and civil rights . 
  even capitalism to function has to have some rules ; otherwise ... well we 're living it and that 's only the beginning . 
  edit : syntax, 
  do n't forget beckett ... 
  i love the theatrical works but also the novels . 
  1 ) the `` merchants of the nations '' , `` the mudreress '' of [ alexandros papadiamandis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexandros_papadiamantis ) , ( all the works of alexadros papadiamandis actually ) , 2 ) the `` lost island '' and `` junkermann '' by [ m. karagatsis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m._karagatsis ) , 3 ) `` mariambas '' , `` the waterloo of two fools '' , `` the divine billy goat '' of [ giannis skaribas ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/giannis_skarimpas ) ( who also has great poetry , but poetry is another huge chapter for modern greek literature ) and i also love the works of zyranna zateli and lena kitsopoulou , both are female contemporaty writers . 
  the first two stanzas that are our national anthem are ( in my opinion ) one of the most beautiful and moving poems i 've even known . 
  note : i do not stand for nationalism at all , it 's the picture of the holy bones and liberty coming out of them that lives me in awe . 
  yet i think we should think some other stanzas this year : stanza 140 she ( liberty ) looks around in europe three times with worry ; turn towards greece , and starts : ... ( where liberty says that nothing stands in the way of hellenes when it comes fighting for freedom but  stanza 144 `` faction , which holds a scepter of cunning , to everyone she ( faction is female in greek as liberty ) smiles `` take it '' saying , `` you too '' . 
  ... stanza 146 `` from envious mouth , men , let 's never be heard , that your hand hits your brother 's head . 
  ** tltr : ** greek national anthem has some stanzas where urges greeks not to be divided . 
  i think more that ever in our after junta history we need to think this . 
  [ think again ... not a very wise solution ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/evagoras_pallikarides ), 
  you are right and i said already that it wo n't help anyone . 
  on the other hand this is happenning for 2 years in greece , in portugal , in cyprus now . 
  i repeat , i do not agree , i would n't do it ( and i have been in demonstrations and riots , but burning other nations flags and blaming the people is not my way ) . 
  but 2 years is a lot . 
  you see those images of hate often enough to think why . 
  that 's what i meant when i said you listen more now . 
  for example here in reddit one year ago i could n't talk with you guys , you were mad at those corrupted lazy tax evaders greeks , you only downvoted what seemed greek ... 
  it 's stupid and blindly emotional , without logic to burn your flag and tear it down your embassy but maybe you start to see desperate people and not just angry haters ? 
  i agree that it is pathetic , i agree that it wo n't help . 
  it surely sents a message though , something that media and their propaganda can not use only to their benefit . 
  i mean you listen more and more these days . 
  ( i hope you do not take it agressively because i really do n't mean it that way ) . 
  something is rotten , why those people seem to hate you , you did nothing , and you are right . 
  something else is happening and being divided does not help . 
  because if you do n't think differently now , you that have the power , you will soon be in the same position . 
  i wish i knew ... 
  i really wish . 
  i guess we all need a new way of thinking on what is happening , even the left parties have nothing to suggest . 
  i think ( as somebody who do not undrstands much in economics ) that we need first of all to agree on some moral issues . 
  for example speculating with money you do not have is a no . 
  i would start with this and put some strict regulation on banks and investment firms . 
  read my first comment , then read every other reply i 've given . 
  i strongly declare that i do not blame the germans . 
  i even said i wish we had made our selfcriticism earlier . 
  but it 's easier to not listen what hurts i guess . 
  we did n't even have democracy for 40 years in a row ... ( and we still have not ) . 
  but how would you know that if you just repeat media propaganda ? 
  for you i 'm a corrupted scum that drinks the blood of `` decent '' tax payers . 
  the news are that corruption is everywere , if the northen countries still have a better level of living it 's only till they wo n't be usefull for the banks to divide europe and push other people to be slaves . 
  then they will be slaves of the banks as well . 
  no , that 's not what i meant to sound like . 
  i do n't believe germans are responsible for the deep shit we ( all ) are in . 
  i believe though that they are the most hated as they are the most powerfull , and i suggest they use their power wisely . 
  well , i know i m going to be downvoted to hell , but you know the answer : vote differently . 
  it 's what you propose to the southern countries when they gasp under your ( government ) blackmails . 
  note : we do not hate you , we do not blame you , we know it 's an economical game that none is going to win ( exept the banks ) and actions of have only serve the propaganda of the media . 
  i really hope you did your autocriticism as we were forced to do ( and of course i wish we did it before all this mess ) . 
  ok , take the popcorn but better switch to the eurovision channel where [ it wo n't be showing your song 's `` empire '' videoclip with alexander the great ... ] ( http://oikotimes.com/2013/02/28/once-again-fyr-macedonia-provokes-greece/comment-page-1/ ) by the way esma redzepova is a great singer , moves me every time i listen to [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2qvuo7qomu ) . 
  calling him pathetic gypsy do n't really make you ( us ) better , sorry , not with you either . 
  `` the greeks '' ? 
  i am greek and i would n't have done anything to them , immigrant or not . 
  this is very brutal and unfair but let 's not make it an argument in this thread . 
  i mean have we reached that point where we compare ourselves to worst to feel better ? 
  it 's not fair , it does n't make it less illegal . 
  this is just sad and underlines the lack of democracy that europe is sinking in . 
  my point exactly . 
  and here is portugal hailing merkel back . 
  [ first hail ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=yqss9lqqbnc ) and [ second hail . 
  ] ( https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/15047_457445597624393_650048922_n.jpg ) i guess now that are not those filthy greek frauds expressing such friendly and warm critisism to all this austerity paranoia she will take the message ( ? ), 
  [ they already tried to kill him once ] ( http://www.koutipandoras.gr/?p=25180 ) ( link in greek ) for writting about relations between corrupted journalists moguls and weapons manufactors . 
  yesterday 's school ( and army ) parades were for the no day , the day we entered ww2 and it 's our second national day . 
  nothing to do with golden dawn , much to do with saying no to faschism . 
  those childern were trying to pass a message through this day . 
  thank you . 
  yet the key word is quite ... 
  i 'll live my parents and my sister . 
  they dispise as well what happens and they are supportive to my decision . 
  this is a very hursh situation as i really love what i do here . 
  it 's just there is no tomorrow . 
  i will follow my boyfriend to london and if everything goes wrong i will go to berlin , where i have friends too . 
  i am also sending cvs to usa as i can teach some `` greek cultural stuff '' so i might get a job offer and so a working visa . 
  wish me luck . 
  edit : let me add here that it really hurts me to leave my country in this state but i litterally feel that i do n't fit anymore . 
  i am not one of the people they are likely to attack first , ( sic immigrant ) . 
  but then again i am an astist , so i am in a `` high danger '' zone ( there was a thread about their actions before a theater , also a writter was attacked last night i think ) . 
  i am not a homosexual , who already are under attack ( two nights before a couple was beaten in the center of the `` gay friendly '' side of the city ) , but i am a woman who speaks out , so i do n't know if i am likely to be attacked . 
  i sure do n't want to live here anymore .
