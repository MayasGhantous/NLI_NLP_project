  i hate to say this but i guess that in a few months europe will be asking italia not only to be under imf 's supervising umbrella but also to borrow from it ( or some other fund ) . 
  we 've seen that show . 
  italia people stay strong , whatever that means ... 
  as the time passes the majority of greek people see the reasons papandreou had to play this ridiculous theater . 
  we would n't be in this pathetic position if it was n't for him and his government in the first place . 
  i 'm not supporting the opposite party , i believe they have the same traitorous politics . 
  let 's hope things would go better . 
  let me introduce you to [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x43dcwkdwfu ) gem ... ( satire , i guess ... ), 
  \u0399 do n't believe that if there was a referendum we would vote to leave the eu . 
  on the contrary i believe that there are strong interests outside the union that want us out and a torn apart europe . 
  wow , i thought we were alone on this planet , but as it seems they are right to say una faca una raca ... hold on italia people , at least you have industry ... cheers from ( even worse ) greece , 
  well ... seems now that he is going in a government of `` national salvation '' and he is not resigning from the leadership of his party . 
  we will see ... 
  were n't us , the greeks , who invented theater in the first place ??? 
  i just feel sad and angry . 
  * edit : two of the names that are being whispered for the next pm in this `` national salvation government '' are the current and the ex president of the bank of greece . 
  not the national bank , they are different banks . 
  the bog is a private bank ... nice huh ?? 
  i guess you 're right . 
  [ nope , he is not ... ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/03/idusa8e7kn01920111103 ) let 's see what happens next . 
  looks like he is going to `` be resigned '' ... let 's have some popcorn and watch the show . 
  only this time the end is not going to be happy in any case ... 
  and then again , not , he ( the pm ) is not resigning ... but the referendum is fending off ... 
  the news are so fast though ... 
  i just listened to the radio that pm is not resigning neither as pm or the leadership of pa.so.k ( party in power ) ... 
  there will be no referendum . 
  the government as all show is falling ... 
  the situation is really strange . 
  i 'm starting to believe that there are other reasons all this theater is happening . 
  because in my opinion it clearly is theater . 
  if papandreou wanted to have a referendum that really would show what people think about the eurozone he would have done it months ago . 
  if he wanted to refresh the `` popular mandate '' for his government or himself in charge ( because there are voices that want him off the party 's leadership ) he would go for elections . 
  i do n't know , i am very very suspicious , even in a worldwide level , i mean it seems to me that this move addresses to everyone else but us , the greeks ... 
  yes , as it seems we can not have a referendum for economic matter ... it also were completely ridiculous to have a referendum about whether we wanted the haircut of the debt ( and the agreement with it of course ) or not . 
  this is only a bit ( ridiculous and sad ) . 
  actually no , it still is completely . 
  sad . 
  i think it just is a mean of blackmailing about the vote of confidence he needs , because we do n't have a real dilemma at this point , plus he needs to legalize the loss of our sovereignty . 
  we should have had a referendum whether to go under the imf the may of 2010 , not now ... 
  because in friday this government has scheduled vote of confidence in the parliament . 
  it would surprise me if this government has n't been fallen by then . 
  the really paranoiac in this situation is that g.papandreou [ is attending the g20 ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.20minutes.fr%2farticle%2f815800%2fpremier-ministre-grec-participera-g20-cannes&amp;act=url ) in thursday and friday ... 
  wtf ?? 
  i guess he wished that . 
  i 'm not sure , i think the two major parties are completely corrupted . 
  i could even believe for them that all this is to attack the euro . 
  something that seems strange to me is that the previous week he had a big meeting with all the media owners . 
  he might asked for their help = propaganda . 
  ** edit : just saw [ this ] ( http://www.20minutes.fr/article/815800/premier-ministre-grec-participera-g20-cannes ) !!!, 
  i 'm in awe ... 
  for the greek people both options seem dark as hell at this point . 
  to my opinion all this all is bad theater . 
  at the time the government is completely broken into pieces and all are showing that elections are coming before the end of the year , with a `` national salvation '' government . 
  i can not believe that eu presidents did n't know , at least some of them were informed . 
  as it seems though we may have elections before the referendum ( that may not happen in this case ) . 
  i agree that greece needs reforms in the major part of its public sector , overlooking your tasteful quotes about  the expert opinion from some angry high-school dropouts who burn german and european flags . 
  i guess though that you have n't been informed that at least france and germany [ knew about this genius political move ... ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.enet.gr%2f%3fi%3dnews.el.article%26id%3d322596&amp;act=url ), 
  [ i would ' t bother arguing in this case ... ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/lsf4f/german_flag_burned_on_the_streets_as_greeks_react/c2vdx4c ), 
  i could n't agree more . 
  that is a total pseudo-dilemma and shitty political maneuvers . 
  plus it seems that g.papandreou is not alone in this one and that [ mercozy were informed ] ( http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.article&amp;id=322596 ) . 
  yeah , fuck them . 
  they have n't done anything for 2000 years , apart from [ two nobel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/giorgos_seferis ) prizes in [ literature ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/odysseas_elytis ) ( the third have n't [ been given ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/angelos_sikelianos ) due to political beliefs ) , some majors in [ classical ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dimitri_mitropoulos ) and [ modern ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iannis_xenakis ) music , an [ opera reformer ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maria_callas ) to mention only few personalities of the arts . 
  let 's not remember [ physics ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dimitri_nanopoulos ) , [ medicine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/georgios_papanikolaou ) and of course they have n't contributed [ anything ] ( http://www.ahistoryofgreece.com/worldwarii.htm ) to the [ ww2 ] ( http://www.enotes.com/history/discuss/what-was-contribution-greece-wwii-93046 ) ... yeah , except you obviously have n't done your homework , fuck them ... * ( oh , and all these are in the 20nth century . 
  let 's do n't go back , to byzantine empire for example ... ) *, 
  the electorate have not changed their mind . 
  i told you in my last reply how this government won the elections . 
  this shows clearly the electorate 's mind . 
  in addition let me inform you that the loan agreement has not been legally voted in the parliament . 
  where it needed 180 votes it only passed with 150 plus something . 
  i can send you if you want ( to translate , since it is in greek and i do n't know the terms ) a list with all the parts that this agreement lacks legalization and flagrantly violates the greek constitution . 
  we do n't have the money to do what ourselves ? 
  we do n't have money anyway and we will have even less with this new agreement . 
  our salaries and pensions ( for god 's sake ! ), 
  are becoming less and less where the cost of living is higher every day . 
  if we go back to ( poor yet honest , as we say ) drachma it is going to be the same ( or even worse ) for a while but then we will have economy again . 
  we will start producing again , something that now seems a distant dream ... 
  man , for god 's sake leave us alone . 
  all your '' [ conversations ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/lhk2s/pictures_from_todays_protests_in_athens_greece/c2su0q0 ) '' are a long quoted argument were you anxiously try to prove that you 're right . 
  [ you can not do that ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/lhk2s/pictures_from_todays_protests_in_athens_greece/c2sqy09 ) . 
  this is a forum , a site . 
  live a little bit , [ seriously ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/l3zun/stay_classy_greeks_stay_classy/c2pku5c ) . 
  it 's like i was trying to convince you that as a scottish your attitude is way to [ slavish ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/lsf4f/german_flag_burned_on_the_streets_as_greeks_react/c2vdx4c ) considering yourself a member of the former british * empire * . 
  but i wo n't convince you , and you know what ? 
  it 's ok ... we do n't like each other , let it be that way , [ what do you need more ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/l6dut/the_world_does_not_consider_hitler_a_criminal/c2q6jmx ) ?? 
  as i 've told you before , i do n't see the reason why i should reply to you since you have repeatedly been referred to my country and myself personally with the most insulting way . 
  please do me the favor and never speak to me again . 
  i guess you can not understand what things are right now here . 
  the referendum is asked since this government came to power with the motto `` no to imf , we have the money to do it ourselves '' and things like this . 
  after the last elections ( 2 years ago ) we have been in the imf and went to `` protected '' bankruptcy twice . 
  we do not ask for your sympathy and we do not need any democracy lessons really , but thank you anyway . 
  it s not only the piig thing . 
  see [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epulonxpnfk ) , or [ this ] ( http://www.fileden.com/files/2007/12/30/1669636/focus%20german.gif ) ... 
  have n't thought of that ... sorry . 
  you re right , germans , well , * were * nazis 70 years ago , a whole nation was and most european countries , including germany have still bitter memories of that period . 
  on the other hand people of greece are called piigs and frauds about what politicians in coordination with the banks have done , at a time when we are really trying to unglue them from being in charge ( i just read in a statistic that 6/10 of the greek people ask for referendum for the debt 's haircut and the governments presents are so low that might be 3rd in the parliament ) . 
  personally every time i 'm to say something ( here or some other forum ) that explains the situation in greece i 'm called fraud , cunt , and other sweet words . 
  it 's not nice / right / i 'm not pro calling anyone nazi , but this is why some of the greek people feels so suppressed and express themselves that way . 
  i thought that it was better to reply straight to anyone willing ( or not ) to hear , than post it in an already full of comments thread . 
  about downvoting , feel free , just * please * read the reply .
