  but if i have n't done this no one except the first one would have read it . 
  i even say that i will spam it in the end , but seriously i understand , feel free to downvote , i just feel that what this comment says is far more important for us greeks to be known than me be downvoted , 
  you 're right , it 's all about newspapers ' sales and propaganda . 
  what today ( and in the last few months ) had happened is more than some greeks burning the german flag . 
  i have to add here that several times greeks have burned greek flags as well . 
  today one of the two annual military parades has been canceled and the president of the democracy has been helped to escape out from some thousands of really angry people . 
  today is also one of the two national celebrations . 
  we celebrate the day when we denied the axis forces access to our lands , back in ww2 . 
  as a very small country and in big trouble back then , as we have been defaulted once again in '32 and in a military dictatorship , we managed rather well to fend off italian forces for 6 months . 
  today the military parade has been canceled , many politicians have been booed ( the president of the democracy among them ) and some of them even bitten !, 
  in the school 's parade students held black pieces of cloth and teachers wore black . 
  the burning of the german flag was again * one * of many expressions of the greek people 's disagreement to political situation , over exposed because of the day . 
  i 'm not trying to defend acts of violence here , or to say that calling the germans nazis should be acceptable . 
  but i believe the same way it should n't be acceptable to call us piigs or frauds . 
  we are not . 
  the rage is big , it 's dangerous for all of us i guess to speak without think twice in these times . 
  i will copy this and paste it to other comments as a reply as well . 
  i hope i 've answered some questions about today 's episodes . 
  goodnight to us all ,
