  the comment was relative with the question that posed golden dawn in the parliament that got the 27 year old arrested . 
  of course they can protest and they are not permitted to engage violence , as everybody else . 
  it is the golden dawn 's stance and the role that plays in greece 's politics and economy that i am concerned of ... 
  this , at the same time muslims are protesting about religious causes ... at the same time social care is destroyed and all public property is on sale ... not a great time for greece . 
  a really really dark time in fact . 
  golden dawn scum really delivered this time . 
  yet muslims are wrong to protest about the movie that makes fun of what they believe ? 
  something is rotten in the state of denmark ... 
  you seem to confuse religious fundamentalism with actual war . 
  roger davies has died one month after the [ turkish invasion in cyprus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_invasion_of_cyprus ) where america had [ direct involvement ] ( http://articles.latimes.com/1999/nov/21/news/mn-35991 ) . 
  i 'm not saying that it was n't a very faut pas , nevertheless those two are completely different situations . 
  this , or that stupid ( constructed in my opinion ) movie will be the lamest casus belli of all times ( until now ) ... 
  cunts are never stupid . 
  let me guess , golden dawn 's theories about the superiority of males ? 
  golden dawn has one job yes , to protect the corrupted and attack to those that seem to think ( [ even to satyric facebook pages for god sake !,

  and they 're doing it with great success unfortunately ... * the article is in gtranslate , could n't find it in english . 
  you 're right . 
  i guess this is a sign page to put pressure on the greek parliament on canceling the fascist deputies ' immunity . 
  i think that it would be better to cancel all parliament immunity but it 's a start ... 
  yes yes , i know that ... 
  i understand that . 
  thanks for the enlightening thoughts . 
  we do n't seem to understand eachother though , i 'll blame the internet and the cultural differences . 
  i 'm not angry to calm down , i just tried to describe the situation , that 's all . 
  any way you do n't seem to understand though as you insist to tell me that we should protest . 
  which part was n't clear of what i said ? 
  or maybe i can not understand you and you mean , i wish things were different and having solved all your other problems , i 'd suggest you would protest for the list . 
  dude , i tried to explain it to the previous comments , yet it seems you ( not * you * personally , but all the greek flag haters that downvote instantly without reading ... they even downvoted me in a greek recipe !!!, 
  anyway that 's the least of my concerns right now , i only mention it to underline the hate ) did n't get the whole picture : this government wo n't do this . 
  period . 
  it 's their names in there . 
  instead we will have new measures of austerity that cut off pensions , health care , culture and education . 
  last elections were 3 months ago . 
  these very persons ( the corrupted polititians ) were supported of the elite of the eu leaders and media by spreading statements and rumors that if we do n't vote for them we will be forced to leave the union . 
  i did n't vote for them , however some ( not a large majority ) of the people did . 
  how are you ( again not you personally ) suggest to go on a protest against them , the same persons you supported 3 months ago ? 
  and why should we go for this and not for not keeping their word ? 
  as they said , in their pre election campaign , there would be a renegotiation of the memorandum ( something that no reasonable man could ever believe ) . 
  i mean it 's like having a knife in your back ( that you also kinda choose it to be there ) and you protest against the unjustice of the world . 
  of course it make sense but it 's not really your first concern . 
  quantity and quality of the oil can change everything . 
  but i think that you should apply it after the aubergine is baked with a little butter , salt and pepper , and the rest of the ingredients are added  . 
  i will cook today makaronia me kima :d , kisses , theia ( = aunt ) voula . 
  as it seems really hard to understand after all , let me make it easier for you :  yaix : `` have you asked yourself why those pensioners and cancer patients are left without medicine ? 
    garitsos : `` do you really believe that i have n't ?! '', 
  the comment you replied to , was an answer to diehard3 that suggested to go on a protest about the decision not to buy the list with the names of the tax evaders . 
  we can not protest to give the little money we have left to buy blackmailing and speculative data when we can not take care of our people . 
  it 's about priorities . 
  is it clearer now ? 
  sure , but you can also use telemes ( a bit like feta but of cow milk ) which is lighter and melts better . 
  hurt german ? 
  maybe you d consider twice now before you act like boss ? 
  never , if i do n't read the pig ( s ) word . 
  and i have made a valid acronym for this . 
  or ... they 'd were baked in the oven with feta , a little garlic , fresh ( or dry ) tomato , oregano and [ parsley ... ] ( http://www.tavernoxoros.gr/img/i/kebud4elzzkj ) ?? 
  do you really believe that i have n't ?!, 
  is it that * really hard to understand * that it was an answer to the protest exhortation thing and to where to give the money we have left . 
  it 's about priorities , dude !, 
  that was from another [ cultivating and friendly conversation we had ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/106w0l/athens_refuses_to_buy_file_on_taxevaders/c6ba1qv?context=3 ) . 
  putting all these pieces of the puzzle together really makes a hell of a picture ... 
  yes , mainly to buy lists of taxevading polititians and businessmen ( the same germany supported in the last elections and some more ) from switzerland . 
  this is the spirit . 
  yea , [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/103dkz/greek_economy_to_shrink_25_by_2014/c6aabgw ) all over again . 
  you know what ? 
  let 's make love and make a nazi pig !, 
  edit : explanation : northern association of zealous industrialists, 
  how you dare to call a northerner corrupted ? 
  even when common sense is raped and dead northerners have a higher reason to do it ... ( sarcasm ), 
  that exactly was my point . 
  during the pre elections period nd and pasok campaign was based on re negotiation of the debt and how they would not take any more `` commands '' from the troika . 
  if tsipras would have been elected he would have done the same with what pasok and nd is doing now . 
  he just has not the `` connections '' yet to share the money , that 's all . 
  but he will learn unfortunately ... 
  i was talking about germany 's support to the deep corruption ( pasok and nea dimokratia ) . 
  do n't take it the wrong way though , i m not supporting tsipras at all . 
  but it seems to me really odd that the eu elite politicians exclude him from any conversation . 
  he is the leader of the second party after all . 
  sure , who knows ... yet he is more of a wan na be than already there . 
  is that a reason to support the bigger sharks ? 
  yes !, 
  let 's do this !, 
  pay switzerland whith loan money ( which we already are short of ) so they can * sell * to us the names of those from which they make big money , and above all protest this , knowing that it wo n't happen because on that list are mostly names of greek polititians . 
  yet back in june ( during the elections ) germany 's stance was with these polititians . 
  start believing . 
  is * that * a reason to protest when , at the same time , pensioners and cancer patients are left without medicines ? 
  unless you were refering to the swiss people for not tolerating their bank system being a huge factory of money laundry . 
  the only problem is that the newspaper owners who have the money to buy it will probably see their names on the list ... 
  you know what ? 
  you 're right . 
  i do n't know if you have noticed but germans are n't exactly the friend everybody wish for to have a great time and deep human relations with . 
  why do i have to `` make '' you like me ? 
  and most of all why do i have to be `` controllable '' for you to like me . 
  i thought we were here to talk to each other , exchange opinions and cultivate ourselves through this . 
  if i have to * convince * you that i am a `` ok guy '' no , thanks , that 's not how it works . 
  if you can not understand the game of propaganda and the redistribution of money that happens and that the southern countries are gon na be the cheap working hands of the eu how can i make you see this if you hate me before you even know me ? 
  i have read it and agree completely . 
  but i decided that i have read so many insulting things for us greeks that i will respond in the same tone every time i read such bullshit . 
  it 's me after all that have responded to you that i do believe we need changes and it will be painful while you said to me to go fuck myself dog or no dog . 
  well ...
