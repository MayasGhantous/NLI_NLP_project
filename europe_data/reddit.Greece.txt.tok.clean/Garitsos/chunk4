  insulting whole countries and refer to their people as common beggars wo n't solve anything basically because they can not identify with what you have in mind . 
  so there 's no common ground to even start a conversation . 
  for example greeks feel that troika asks too much of them . 
  same in portugal and spain . 
  who 's right exactly in this situation ? 
  as for the lame acronym i only hope you understand now how we feel every time we read the * term/acronym/bullshit my ass * pigs, 
  oh , thank you for your advice , nazi !, 
  please do n't take it personal , nazi is just a acronym for northern association of zealous industrialist assholes . 
  but we cut out assholes because it was offensive ... 
  cheers , so you wo n't feel alone in the downvotes . 
  yea ... try larissa station , agios pandeleimonas , peiraios or eleonas to the roma camps ... exarchia is just the mainstream `` bad place '' where you can have your coffee and feel good about you being a `` revolutionary '' . 
  thank you for clarifying that . 
  it definitely is something i would n't have thought myself . 
  of course i do not understand what has to do with the corruption thing , does that justifies all this papademos dirty thing ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  as a raskalnikow you should not trust them so much . 
  your dear friend , dmitri prokofitch razumihin, 
  you ' re right ; and as i have artistic mood tonight i wo n't feed the trolls nor the dogs or the bitches . 
  i 'll feed the birds instead : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhrrxqvufn4&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=58s, 
  there are dogs and there are bitches ... which side are you on ? 
  edit : a little something http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iaim02kv0g, 
  i think i already answered why i did n't comment on anything else , but * what the heck * , you know me/us better than i/we know my/ourselves . 
  do you really need to feel that you cornered a proud greek ??? 
  anyway , truth is in the eye of the beholder , as they say . 
  guess what that makes you in my eyes ... 
  nevertheless have a great evening and i hope you calm down . 
  after all you have to go to work tomorrow , make some money , to pay your taxes , while i do n't as i am unemployed yet i pay taxes as well ... 
  is this a real question ? 
  i mean does that make any difference ? 
  anyway , i was referring to the posts of yours in this thread i had read until i commented . 
  why should i ? 
  i do believe that we need changes , i know that it will be painfull , and i m not an economist to propose solutions . 
  now if you are pissed of and need a scape goat for your anger does not legitimite you to command anyone . 
  if * i * would do that with * you * privately , well ... 
  i would n't in the first place because , you see , i do not take commands . 
  dog or no dog in your eyes , i do have and deserve the same rights with you . 
  deal with it . 
  that ridiculous argument about the sneaking in the eu again !, 
  let me inform you on some painful truths : the guy who cooked the numbers , loukas papademos , were afterwards vice president of the ecb . 
  after you caught the filthy liar we are , refused to let us go on a referendum about the bailout and supported him for the prime minister position , and he took it . 
  are the eu leaders so stupid that they were once more fooled by us ? 
  are we that satanic geniuses of mischief ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  actually far from it . 
  something is rotten in the state of denmark . 
  and it 's not only the greek corruption . 
   do n't you dare to assume we 're stupid .  who are *** you *** and who are *** us *** that are not permitted to *** dare *** exactly ???? 
  funny comments under the title `` greece is not a dog : the arrogance of the austerians '' . 
  oh , thank you !, 
  now everything is clear !, 
  but why do you arrgue in the first place if you deny to get in the shoes or even listen to the other part ? 
  quoting , linking and concidering that you know the ultimate truth about something you do not experience wo n't prove or solve anything ... 
  [ haters gon na hate ... ] ( http://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/2012/3/20/20308cd7-53da-4e2a-9c91-6d5c72e6a4a8.gif ), 
  thank you . 
  i really hope this as well . 
  we are after all kind of a grotesque mirror of the european union . 
  ... and as we all know nazis are nothing but good christians ... 
  i have to inform you though that members of ecb have immunity ** for life ** ... pretty interesting do n't you think ? 
  the saddest thing is that there is no such thing as a greek race . 
  this guy looks slavic , not because he is a second generation immigrant ( that would be an excuse ) but simply because we had slavs ( as there are albanians , turks , roma etc ) for many generations in the greek territories ( i mean even before the new greek state was founded ) . 
  what separated `` greeks '' from `` turks '' in the greek revolution was only religion and not at all race . 
  so now you can understand the true size of their stupidity and ignorance . 
  not that anyone cares or that makes any difference , but i am deeply sad ... 
  now i know who you are . 
  with unemployment percentages in 23,1 % ( and more ) , forcing the rest of the population who works hard to work harder wo n't solve anything . 
  what greece really needs is more jobs , not legalizing slavery laws ... 
  nothing wrong with children working in hideous conditions , sure . 
  after all they do n't die out of hunger as in africa , which is also * nothing wrong * . 
   those greeks who were employed in the bloated government institutions enjoyed bonuses for working inefficient jobs . 
  the thing is that * those greeks * ( or french/german/etc ) wo n't be forced to work more and get payed less . 
  no pain for them . 
  so i guess for them it actually * is * a painless way to pay it back ; to force other people take the pain for them . 
  istanbul comes from the combination of the words `` is tin poli '' which means `` to the city '' . 
  the city for the roman byzantium was constantinople ( as rome was for the italian part ) . 
  both words have greek roots , so there is n't a real reason for argument . 
  [ this is ] ( http://imgur.com/sfyqh ) what sums up golden dawns part in the corrupted greek political system . 
  ( the guy is gd 's leader ), 
  nevertheless * socrates drunk the conium * because he * `` introduced to youngsters new demons '' . 
  * religion ( then , in the ancient times ) was not about dogma . 
  it was about the way of life , something that in ourdays i believe has been replaced by the `` lifestyle '' . 
  in rome that happened as well . 
  first christians were not thrown into the lions because they believed to some other god but because they would n't accept the emperor as god . 
  christianity then changed this and organized belief into dogma , in their effort to legalize power mainly between rome and constantinople . 
  religion has many forms . 
  it 's not about `` god '' and what we call religious need or `` awe of the mystic/unknown ect '' . 
  it 's mainly about a total of every day rules that has to do with how a society functions .

  let 's hope until then you ll have acquired some humor and i wo n't have lost it . 
  i will reply when i enter the 21st century apparently and achieve your superior understanding and tolerance . 
  until then i will just be the lazy corrupted full of hatred scape goat of the united europe . 
  well i never said that , nor the official stand of greece is this . 
  have n't you read the whole answer ? 
  have you stopped to the comma ??? 
   not in relation with the ancient macedonia ... etc etc ... . well we just disagree . 
  it is possible, 
  yes , well , macedonia is just a region , not a country , there is not a macedonian nation , not in relation with the ancient macedonia . 
  so many other places are just regions and not countries . 
  macedonia is one of them . 
  read the history of the debate you will find some valid arguments . 
  then again if not , well we just disagree .
