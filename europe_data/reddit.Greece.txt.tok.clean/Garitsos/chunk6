  see the statistics of the last election and you will find out that the majority of the people that voted for the corrupted politicians where the `` lazy '' guys who work in the civil sector , the old generation . 
  the most analysts does not give more than 6 months in this government . 
  oh , the self-complacency ... you are my nemesis , it 's true . 
  and as a closer to our most pleasant conversation i 'll quote some words of wisdom i once heard on the street by a british tourist . 
  `` sarcasm is the lowest form of wit '' . 
  have a great day and fuck ( you ) some more . 
   those goatfuckers ( let me remind you here that you are scottish ... )  the piigs countries . 
  i rest my case . 
  do n't even try to make it seem like you are not partial towards piigs and especially greece . 
  [ you have done this to the past ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/lsf4f/german_flag_burned_on_the_streets_as_greeks_react/c2vftms ) . 
  fuck you . 
  touche spec , you did my name a pun . 
  good for you to feel better through harassing the economically weaker via the internet . 
  fuck you . 
  the archaeological site of [ dion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dion,_pieria ) . 
  it 's in the region of pieria , in macedonia , near the olympus mountain . 
  if you like hiking you can go to olympus too . 
  fuck you . 
  question : what do you do in a post such as `` just boobies '' ??? 
   both sides are equally wrong most of the time ... both sides have a history of ethnic cleansing and genocidal behaviour either you are completely ignorant of history or you are trolling . 
  if there are such sources please provide . 
  no , they are not . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.uk.digiserve.com/mentor/marbles/cleaning.htm ) and [ link ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/1999/nov/08/davidhencke ), 
  ... we are a deeply democratic democracy ... 
  laconic and completely off topic . 
  i wo n't answer any further . 
  you are really rude and i do n't have the time . 
  there is wikipedia after all ... 
  first of all , no , i ' m not one of those people . 
  second i 'm not paranoid , i just understand why the policy towards fyrom is the way it is and i 'm just trying to explain here why it is like that , and last but not least i am not a man . 
  oh wow , i ca n't help but admit that you gave the conversation a tone of civilized and logical argument !, 
  minority in thraki : turkey claims a minority in thraki . 
  we also have a problem with our [ \u0395\u0395\u0396 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exclusive_economic_zone ) with turkey . 
  we just can not afford to doubt our territorial integrity . 
  as i said to bezbojnicul it is not possible that to happen , to back off . 
  we also are called greeks , yet we identify ourselves as hellenes . 
  ( which as you admitted includes macedonian heritage from the ancient ages to nowadays ) . 
  german people as well they call themselves deutch . 
  many countries identify themselves differently than the international community calls them . 
  well , we agree to disagree ... we can not do this . 
  next thing will be the minority in thraki and things are going to be nasty . 
  also to your question : our territorial integrity is indeed fragile . 
  not our national identity ( yet ) , like real balkan . 
   so if ... . sop their territorial claims ? 
  no greeks have no claims , as they have no politics at all ... ( not that i 'm implying that they should ) . 
  the name is just a step to the territorial claim in that insane argument . 
   actually , genetically , the populations of those areas were not affected by the migrations of historical times . 
  so , it 's about race ? 
  because if it is , fyrom does not stand a chance ...  also , another question ... . ect . 
  i 've never heard a major area of turkey called bulgaria or anything similar . 
  i bet that if there was it would be a problem . 
  it 's not about a greek * term * . 
  but i want to ask sth . 
  ok , it 's obvious and pretty logical that i support the greek side of the argument . 
  what do you believe it would be the right thing to do ? 
  you do see logic in those claims ? 
  would it be right to back off and accept the term macedonia which defines a big period of our history and cultural heritage used as a part of an insane campaign against our territory ? 
  i was talking about the fact that the ancient macedonians did not slavicized because they were n't ancient anymore and many other people have been to the area all those years . 
  there is [ no real connection ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:macedonia_overview.svg ) to these two * populations * because well , some centuries of migrations have passed meanwhile . 
  if we want to find relations with the slavic tribes we should begin to look for macedonians in pakistan , india , egypt and the rest of the empire of alexander . 
  i can understand why the people in the area define themselves as macedonians , yet there are more macedonians that define themselves as such and also of hellenic heritage . 
  this thing is obviously not about the name . 
  it 's about the distortion of historical facts and [ territorial claims ] ( http://www.macedonian-heritage.gr/maps/map4.html ) . 
  no greek as a language of choice !, 
  greek here as you can see and ** not ** looking for a fight . 
   suggest against calling the country fyrom or the people slavomacedonian on the other hand calling your country macedonia which is a far larger region than your country is like you have territorial claims and at the same time not embracing that  you do n't actually claim to be the direct descendants of the ancient macedonians . 
  you are proud of your slavic heritage i can understand that fyrom is not a great name but you really have to find another since we live near and not in the other side of the planet . 
  also i did n't understand what you said about  ancient macedonians ended up getting assimilated into the slavic tribes . 
  are you referring to macedonia as the alexander macedonia ? 
  when did this assimilation happened ? 
  i ' m not saying that it did n't happened but the slavic people had made their entrance in the territory around the 6th century . 
  ancient macedonian empire ended up to the hellenistic period and completed with the battle of actium in 31 bc ... 
  the period you seem to talk about is byzantium = eastern roman empire . 
  well , you can always respond with hilarious sarcasm and take the focus of the non understanding part to the comedy  then either you have eliminated the sarcastic rude creep or you get a joke as an answer and you know for sure it was a joke , 
  i knew that ... it was a joke . 
  a joke about feta . 
  feta is not champagne , or better champagne is not feta . 
  exactly . 
  we drink feta in special occasions ... 
  [ \u0395\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03a0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7 \\ ( which is constantinople by the way . 
  like you call your city `` to the city '' \\ ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypnxbwl9tk ), 
  whaaaaat ? 
  seriously guys next thing you say is that you do n't dance syrtaki ... no wonders why our country is failing ... 
  not if you are dead inside, 
  so true ... 
  i work this period as a free lancer for the public sector ( as there are no jobs anywhere else ) and they could n't decide and find a legal form for our contract so they had us working for 2 months without a contract and without get payed of course . 
  only when i became furious and started to threat that i was going to sue them one lady ( who she had no responsibility for our matter ) actually had a solution in two days ... because the one who was in charge never worked . 
  we need to have no permanent worker in the public sector . 
  but it 's not about civilians ... exactly . 
  this is completely about banks , yet we are the [ slackers ... ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/v74jc/euro_2012_greece_to_take_on_germany_in_ultimate/c523f4a ) because obviously we are not already working more hours that the germans , yet largely underplayed and without any result ...
