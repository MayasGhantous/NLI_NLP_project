  i bet you really have experienced a gulag so you compare it with living in the richest country in the eu and find it similar ... 
  because the article was all about football and not at all about politics ... 
  you support your exports competitiveness . 
  nothing to do with greece or any other country . 
  or benevolence ... 
  the [ benevolent lender ] ( http://www.enterpriseirregulars.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/loanshark_large.jpg?37e08b ) who is the only one benefited by his charity ... 
  this , or to make a profit out of the bets germany has already bet against her winning . 
  the thing is ( and i 'm writing this in english so everyone can understand if have the curiosity or the patience to follow this surreal conversation until now ) that this is a bank thing , not about how greeks are the scapegoat of europe . 
  if we do n't ( i mean all the people of europe ) change this now we wo n't have much chances in the future . 
  spain is next and after comes cyprus . 
  we wo n't last much longer even if nd wins the elections , simply because we wo n't have any money to live , every penny from the loans is going to the loans and all this has nothing to do with the development this memorandum supposed to help us have . 
  soon all free property will be owned by the banks . 
  this is not what we want as a future . 
  edit : also , thanks for the invitation ,

  i see from your answering post that you really lack taste in music ... it 's ok , as we , who speak greek fluently , say `` peri orekseos kolokithopita '' . 
  nevertheless , let me add here that this is not a post that supports tsipras . 
  obviously you do n't know german and did n't bothered to google the lyrics . 
  du hast sounds like ha\u00dft ... so it means both have ( you have me ) and hate ( you hate me ) . 
  to avoid further misunderstanding let me give you a [ complete translation of the lyrics with an analysis ] ( http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/du-hast-english-lyrics-lyrics-rammstein/fdfa3ccc2ba8b0cf48256caf000abdf1 ) of its * poetry *, 
  ok i will . 
  he is not judging a whole population by the opinion of a minority , but by the opinion of his state 's propaganda . 
  he does n't know that eu leaders , the leaders he voted , literally put on charge in our country the same persons who he is blaming they cheated and stole europe 's money . 
  he likes to think he is on the right side and that he lives in a country where everyone is decent ... well , of course we do n't feel we did it right , but neither did they , still it 's easier to blame us ... it surely is time for self-criticism , for all of us . 
  we are living in a soap opera apparently ... 
  actually they are not fine ... [ link ] ( http://www.uk.digiserve.com/mentor/marbles/cleaning.htm ) and [ link ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/1999/nov/08/davidhencke ), 
  thank you for pointing this out . 
  i do n't really have to  try to read `` greece '' and `` germany '' not as `` you '' and `` me '' , it was your words  will anyway continue doing what they do best : screwing up and then crying for help . 
  that gave me the * impression * you where referring to the people , i did n't realize you where referring to greece itself ( and in plural ) . 
  also i know that there 's  no need to be passive aggressive !, 
  i am not , it 's called sarcasm and deal with it . 
  ( unless of course you , germany , where addressing once more to greece as a being who is passive aggressive ) now , which part you missed when i told you that merkel supported papademos for our last pm , who was the head who cooked the numbers for greek economy to enter the euro . 
  if i  simply * can not * deny the evidence of the fact that our elected representatives shamelessly lied to the eu regarding the country 's financial status then why the same persons were accepted by your incorruptible politician of high morality as the only solution ??? 
  as for screwing ... yea , good luck with your exports ( let alone the borrowing rates ) after the fail of the euro-zone . 
  and the worst part is that this is not between germany and greece . 
  it 's a game of banks in which only banks can really win . 
  mentalities as yours , and to be clear now i do address to you as a person , only harm the people of europe . 
  if we do n't see this situation differently none of us has an economic future . 
  well , excuse me , i really do n't want to sound rude but : surely greek history has itself huge imperialistic moments * but * there is an immense gap between `` empire '' and `` the birth of what we call today western civilization '' . 
  it s about culture , not economic prosperity . 
  of course they are communicating vessels , yet not always , * but * they are certainly not the same . 
  let me add here that i also believe nationalistic dreams of the past are only harming europe . 
  of course we love our countries but nobody is better than anybody else . 
  it 's all about what ** we ** do ** today ** . 
  thank you for letting me know that what i do best is screwing and crying for help . 
  maybe i screw you and call some of my fellow pigs friends to help me . 
  now , as for the huge taxes you re paying ( and obviously i do n't ) they just ensure that germany can borrow with close to zero rate . 
  ... and the corruption ... the lies about numbers , and all that so 2010 propaganda ... well , bother to google about siemens ( omg !, 
  ) , do the math as you medidate on what mercozy literally imposed as a regime in my country when papandreou ( whom i do n't support ) suggested we go for a referendum ... was papademos ( the prime minister of the junta we had for the last months ) maybe the one who was `` cooking '' the mumbers for us to enter euro , the head of the bank of greece during the `` fraud time '' ???? 
  think more . 
  no , she asked him about his trail that had been postponed a day before . 
  the thing is he 's likely to be sentenced if the trial will take place *** before the elections *** , because if he will be elected he will have the parliament asylum , as long as he is elected he can not be accused . 
  then if he stays elected long enough his accusations may be barred . 
  that 's also why they can not find him even though there is a flagrant warrant for this morning 's assaults . 
  the flagrant ends 48 hours after the claim of assault , then postponing the trials leads to laps of accusations . 
  justice ... 
  what the hell , yea . 
  lets have our dicks out , measure them . 
  us too , if you recall , because of you was just one of the past times . 
  i do have a strong imagination and what hurts me the most is when i realize my dreams can not be real ... does n't mean though i wo n't fight for them . 
  it is a dangerous situation for you too , so beware of what you propose . 
  this or i do n't work at all . 
  you really do n't have a clue about the situation , do n't you ? 
  i work around 10-12 hours per day , not only me , the most of us who have the `` privilege '' to actually have a job . 
  i get payed for far less . 
  so fuck you , say what makes you feel better but it 's coming for you too ... 
  i did n't realize that , sorry . 
  i have n't understood that by `` prejudices '' you were referring to the stalin theme . 
  so let me cut the `` psst ... let me inform you '' and put a `` let me add here '' as well as the `` read more '' part . 
  have a great day . 
  unofficially , yes, 
  it seems they were absent in the history class ... 
  psst ... let me inform you that those several centuries are much less than the term exists and has been created from other people of other culture and language ... read more . 
  the main separation of the greeks and the turks in the ottoman empire was basically religion . 
  turks were never christians where many of slavic clans were , as a result of the late roman empire ( the period we call byzantium ) foreign policy . 
  on the contrary many greek/christian people became muslims when turks took over what was left of the roman empire . 
  so you can say that greeks is a nation of several origins but turkish is not a main one . 
  also turks are not mainly arabs . 
  in greece the politicians are either nazis or they are pro bailout ? 
  no there are more parties . 
  actually the second bigger party that this time has the `` order of forming a government '' is a left , versus bailout party that until last elections was in 3 % to 5 % ...  i 'd be rioting in the street if those were my two choices . 
  i think noone can say we did n't have enough of that either . 
  chisi avgi ( the neo - nazi party ) has not a clear economic program , simply because it has no brains to think one . 
  it 's all about immigrants and big guys helping ladies to go to the bank or the drug store safely . 
  it also is voting with rage . 
  sad but true . 
  it was more than an elite of aristocrats , it was what ancient world 's perception of society of `` free citizens '' . 
  of course it did n't include slaves , women and immigrants but it did include every citizen regardless of his aristocratic origin or the income status . 
  and no , neo - nazis have nothing to do even with this perception of democracy . 
  they believe in a socialistic way of economy ( where in ancient athens the economy was all about free market and trade ) and abolish every type of elections that was a basic point of politics . 
  even the judges were elected . 
  yes the one who left ... how sad is this , that only one left ... 
  he 's not a grammar nazi , as he was expected after all ... ( the type is ancient and he is ignorant ), 
  that 's the thing ... it does n't even mean all ... it 's the singular type of ancient imperative ... 
  how ridiculous that man is . 
  apart from the irrelevant translation he gave for the veni vidi vici quote , he shouted '' \u03b5\u03b3\u03ad\u03c1\u03b8\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9 '' which means stand up , but in singular ( you stand up , as a person , not all of you ) , i mean he does n't even know the plural type which is \u03b5\u03b3\u03ad\u03c1\u03b8\u03b7\u03c4\u0395 ... 
  ... which is totally predictable ( your idea ) considering your perception of things and your way to express it . 
  excluding police officers from immediate arrest gives them time not to be arrested or be in jail at all as by the time they will be prosecuted ( which could be pretty long after them being sued ) their charges could be deleted . 
  it s very kind of you to ask . 
  thank you .
