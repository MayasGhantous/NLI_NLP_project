  i guess you could sent a mail to point out to your representative but they hardly would n't know , it 's just that your show you do not like that . 
  and once again : exempting police officers from the immediate arrest option gives them time not to be arrested or be in jail at all as by the time they will be prosecuted , their charges could be deleted . 
  the point is that this law , that is voted under another name , gives them time not to be arrested or be in jail at all as by the time they will be prosecuted , their charges could be deleted . 
  and it 's clear that this amendment has been made after the dozens of photos and videos of the late riots , where cops are clearly acting illegally , and the tones of lawsuits that have been filed . 
  ** no ** , it 's not about act illegally or be arrested on duty . 
  it 's about if they act illegally while on duty * they wo n't be arrested immediately and not be immediately charged * , even if they are sued after their duty . 
  practically they have *** plenty of time not to be arrested or be in jail at all *** as by the time they will be prosecuted , their charges could be deleted . 
  mikis theodorakis was for years a part of this corrupted system that infected greek society . 
  let 's not forget he had been a minister without portfolio as well as minister of sate with nea democratia , ( the main central right party ) in contrast to the fact that he was `` in exile '' in paris ( ! ), 
  during the military junda back in the 70s and had been for years to the kke ( the communist party ) . 
  not to mention that he was general manager of ert ( hellenique radio and television company ) music ensembles , where he , for the one year he had been in power , scheduled concerts with his music *** only *** . 
  that means he was payed as a general manager , as the composer and the conduct\u03bfr of literally every performance ert had in time . 
  [ not ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/1999/nov/12/helenasmith ) even [ close ... ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/1999/nov/08/davidhencke?intcmp=ilcnettxt3487 ), 
  wow , you are wise ... thank you for your priceless advises that i or my people have never thought of ... 
  i now respect you so much more . 
  maybe it was n't clear enough that i wo n't be in an argument with a person that enjoys repeat stupid and misinformed positions when he can not even read a text right , letting him being super offensive to me . 
  it 's just a shame to see some german people doing the same mistake again and again . 
  have a nice life , think more . 
  he is *** not *** our elected representative you ignorant . 
  he was not even in the parliament , not even a politician . 
  he is a positioned *** non elected *** something near dictator that came up when merkel and sarkozy would n't like us to have a referendum ... you know what ? 
  that 's enough . 
  go read more , get informed or stfu and stop embarrassing your country . 
   and if you think that our media is keeping information and facts from me , please enlighten me , what am i missing here that makes the rioters of athens right and me wrong ? 
  have i said that rioters of athens are right ??? 
  then again how could i try to enlighten you when  that letter is precisely what i am talking about , a bunch of conspiracy theories when you think you know how we entered the eurozone and have such a clear image about who we are . 
  and about  the most laughable part of that letter is the part where merkel is being accused of pressuring greek politicians into granting her and other german politicians immunity from possible greek prosecution . 
  seriously , is there a single greek citizen that really thinks that our politicians need protection from the greek police/justice departments ??? 
  placing one of our ministers/heads of state under arrest in greece would result in the shortest and most one-sided war in the long history of greece , no german politician feels remotely threatened by that yes , read more carefully next time , the article speaks about the members of the * greek * government , and it implies our current prime minister 's , loukas papademos , position in the ecb after cooking the numbers for entering the euro . 
  fearing he would be prosecuted for fraud he was positioned in the ecb were he would have immunity . 
  how about that ... take your position , enlighten you ... how could i if you are not willing to hear . 
  anyway , i made my point and you just made it stronger . 
  let 's hope things wo n't get worse . 
  well , [ this old man ] ( http://pontosandaristera.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/glezos3.jpg ) sprayed in the face is manolis glezos . 
  this gentleman had taken down the nazi flag from acropolis in the nazi occupation of athens , back in the 40s . 
  if the pig that sprays him in the face is not a `` bloody fascist '' then words and language is nolonger a means of communicate our ideas . 
  maybe we could put ourselves in your position and maybe we already are , but we are never asked what we think , we are only getting nice names on us or instruction about what we should do . 
  as for corruption between germany and greece , i am trying to find in the net an open letter that has been sent to merkel by `` the new filiki eteria '' ( greeks that leave and work in foreign countries ) , and i can not find it in any other language than greek . 
  [ this is the ] ( http://translate.google.gr/translate?sl=el&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=el&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.madata.gr%2fepikairotita%2fpolitics%2f169282.html&amp;act=url ) gtranslate mode but it wo n't be good . 
  still you 'll get the idea . 
  and please do n't get me wrong , i m not trying to imply anything about you or your people . 
  i even have been born in k\u00f6ln , my parents were students there . 
  i m just trying to tell you that your media as well are not so free to speak . 
  i am having a really heavy program without even get payed , without mentioning that i do n't believe i have the knowledge of economy that i should :o ) ... 
  i m trying though to live through ( as well to show with my work and way of living ) a different way , to focus on working and walk all together in this difficult time and crush corruption . 
  i am one of those that have n't given up on the eu dream and are against violence . 
  i even am pro taxation , but i can not be blind to the huge injustice that is happening and certainly i can not be deaf to my fellow people that are pro leaving euro . 
  and last but not least , i can not read all this stereotype mudslinging and not answer . 
  we are not beggars , we are not lazy , we are not just brutal rioters . 
  we are a nation who tries to redefine itself . 
  it is painful enough , we do n't need to be called anything . 
  you should . 
  coming here and expressing such admiration is rather dangerous for you . 
  have fun wherever you go . 
  but we know about all this . 
  they are free to vote i guess , as you guessing that we are free to vote , only we are not . 
  iamamemeama 's answering your question but i would like to add : lately in [ / r/europe ] ( / r/europe ) we greeks come across all this stereotype talk that is totally mudslinging about us . 
  have you ever asked what we think ? 
  all i see is threads that `` prove '' how we do not pay taxes , how lazy , how brutal rioters we are . 
  why do you think it would be a priority for us to defend germany 's point ? 
  i guess the tax system is very different . 
  the point i m trying to make is that the impact that has to everyday life is really catastrophic for the middle and low class . 
  i m with you when you say that default would be worse . 
  i believe so too . 
  but it also seems that we wo n't be able to fix the problem if we do n't default . 
  austerity measures only bring ( and already have ) more economic ( and personal ) depression . 
  as for the elections you mention , at first i have to underline here that our prime minister for the last months has been a former banker , the one that cooked the numbers to enter euro . 
  we should have had a referendum then ( for our entry ) as well as several months ago for the default . 
  we had that refused by the european leaders and the date for the elections that has been announced then has already passed . 
  true . 
  to this ( the number of the workers ) add the deep corruption of the public sector and the unemployment rates and you have an image why productivity is very low . 
  this does not indicate though that we are lazy , it rather answers the question why while not being lazy having a low productivity . 
  yes , that was what i meant , leaving the euro , not the eu . 
  yesterday was a long day and by the time i was writing to you was too late ( here ) . 
  i m not try to win people , i m not trying to make anyone sympathize me . 
  as for links numbers and sources i ve read hundreds and could give you more . 
  have [ these ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/28/world/europe/greeks-balk-at-paying-new-property-tax.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all ) for example for the [ property tax ] ( http://livingingreece.gr/2011/09/19/new-property-tax-greece/ ) argument you find wrong or weird . 
  but whatever link or legitimate source you , or i provide it s just another source that all these years were providing the wrong numbers . 
  by the way the rates of the taxes and income are really unfair . 
  but a question pops in my head every time i come up against somebody who tries to tell me how wrong greek are , how we should be different and all . 
  seeing so many people for several months now in streets in very violent riots , don ' t you at least question yourselves ? 
  never crossed your mind that those people are either despaired or they really want something different , so in both cases let them have it ? ... 
  for the last months the government we have is not voted by the greek people . 
  the prime minister is a former banker , actually the one who was in charge in the bank of greece when we entered euro . 
  never said it s not our fault , on the contrary . 
  i said though that learning the situation from links , sites ect really make you a very distant from reality provider of solutions . 
  it makes you a guy that sees somebody down and tells him it 's his fault and then open a discussion with him to prove it to him . 
  that , in my eyes , is comedy . 
  i ' m not trying to convince you that you are wrong , relax . 
  what i care for is to be heard as a different voice . 
  i m so tired to hear that we are frauds and lazy . 
  it 's very easy when somebody is down to tell him that it 's his fault . 
  i am also not speaking about the proper property tax that we payed until now , i ' m speaking about the extra bill `` about the crisis '' . 
  so you think taxes in greece are low but do n't you think you should count in your study the salaries ? 
  the taxes are low but the income is lower compering to other countries of the eu . 
  and what about cost of living . 
  have you any idea how much have our salaries reduced after the imf ? 
  have you any idea how much was the pm salary reduce ? 
  nearly none . 
  i never said that 6 out of 10 greeks had no income at all .
