  try to do the math though . 
  i can assure you that the unemployment rating is much higher than the official , sth i can not prove you with links . 
  at least not some you would find legitimate . 
  last month my friend went to write himself in the unemployment office and the process has became lately so complex that not only him , but a big amount of people can not be written down . 
  this is another `` false number '' , do n't you think ? 
  this is also another reason of the anger in today 's riots . 
  please stop trying to prove me that we are wrong . 
  i know what we have done wrong and what we should do to fix it . 
  and maybe this passes through leaving eu , something i personally am not pro . 
  but when it comes to our sovereignty i will chose my country and my dignity . 
  because if we had then we would have legalized the over taxing we are suffering now , do n't you think ? 
  have you any idea how much is the property tax incorporated in the electricity bill ( meaning that if you do n't have money to pay it you will have no electricity ) ? 
  have you ever heard about that ? 
  have you any idea about the `` fine '' that you have to pay for the `` semi-outdoor '' room in the house that have been sold `` legally '' all these years from the same state that now punish it ???? 
  for the extra business tax and the fine that called `` peraiosi '' that came to everybody even to those that had no income at all ????? 
  maybe it 's time you ask for more information before you start judging and telling me how my country is . 
  and thank you for all your links , they were really enlightening . 
  no , you re right , there are also the media and construction companies that support them . 
  as for the ordinary people tax evasion is contained in the fields of not asking or giving a receipt for a home lesson or a visit to the doctor for example . 
  something which otherwise would not be affordable for the customer to buy , nor for the provider both to pay this tax and have his business running . 
  ftfy : i bet if * those who voted for the austerity measures * had paid their taxes , * the mob would n't be so angry * and greece might not be in such a shitty situation now . 
  yea . 
  fuck you , or die trying . 
  you do n't have a clue ... maybe you stfu and stop being offensive about things you can not perceive . 
  if you are getting sick seeing greek people protesting , yeah , let 's stop , we would n't like to make you sick , [ distract you from all these huge first world problems you have ... ] ( http://www.economywatch.com/userfiles/working%20hours.jpg ), 
  latest poll give the pro bankruptcy percentage 48,1 % . 
  i , personally , am not pro drachma , but sometimes seems like a one way solution . 
  on the other hand , \u03c4\u03bf give away a part of our sovereignty is awful . 
  for one thing i am sure , that politicians this period in greece as well as in europe are not serving the interests of their people . 
  this . 
  yes , fuck you , die in fire , for greek people are neither beggars , neither asked for your opinion , nor your money . 
  if you are afraid of your economy because the majority in this country wants to go back in drachma , use your little brain to think why greece was in euro in the first place . 
  your leaders knew and drove along with the traitors here to this situation . 
  greek people are not beggars . 
  they ask not for your money . 
  think for a change . 
  yes , fuck you for being indescribably offensive to me and my people . 
  no , you are wrong . 
  the rates of unemployment were high before the referendum which never happened or the bail out that we accepted . 
  the unemployment is caused by the crisis in the economy that forces small and medium sized business to close , a situation that deteriorated last two years by the mnemonium , the austerity measures that had to be taken and the non stopping taxing of the low and medium income people and business . 
  well , the ordinary greek who pays the taxes and suffers the most under this austerity is the majority and there is a bunch of tax dodgers that are mostly from the upper class and are those who have the connections not to be caught and even if they are , not to pay or to pay nothing comparing to what they should . 
  tax evasion in lower classes is contained in the fields of not asking or giving a receipt . 
  for example for a home lesson or a visit to the doctor , something which otherwise would not be affordable for the customer to buy , nor for the provider both to pay this tax and have his business running . 
  ** and we do care about what is happening in your country and worldwide . 
  the `` could n't care less '' was for atheistmil 's ironic statement for greece 's pensioners . 
  our struggling to survive society could n't care less for your heart of any color or the blood that may ( or not ) have in it . 
  we are not a bunch of tax dodgers , we are not thieves or frauds . 
  we are a nation struggling to stand up , striving to re-identify itself with a huge past in every domain ( from culture to corruption ) . 
  if this is not moving you , it s ok , it was n't our attention to bring tears on your eyes or entertain you in any way , this is not a drama movie , nor tv , nor reality , nor tabloids . 
  this is real life and it s completely ok not to care . 
  to abolish euro and return to national currencies is not a solution i can see working , but i 'm with you when you say that at the time europe is ruled by a bankers/politicians-that-are - serving-banks-interests lobby . 
  leaving the euro wo n't do any good as i do n't believe that this lobby will leave the economies to grow back to their healthy state ( if there is any left , fiat in sicily is closing , greece has no industry at all , germany 's exports will be dead if there 's no common market ) . 
  i think that the only solution is to kick out the banks of the eu and proceed in a wider federalization ( or first federalize and then kick banks ) . 
  as i am not an economist i do n't know how that would be possible but that 's the only way out of the crisis i can see ... 
  well civilization has to do with society bonds , hospitality , humor , culture and ideals in my head . 
  monetary system , micro politics and propaganda has nothing to do with it . 
  i 'd say that italy is one of the most civilized places i 've been to and i 've traveled across most countries of this continent . 
  i do n't believe that german people should pay for war reparations . 
  but about :  the idea that the young should pay the price for wars and injustices of past the unemployment 's percentage in greece for people around 30 is a ) the official report 28,29 % and b ) the real number sth under 50 % . 
  also the taxes are harder for the low income citizens , the ones that have n't gone in the fraud 's party when the elite had the loans . 
  seems like we are paying for the injustices of the past ... 
  i guess this article was n't about ritschl 's idea for germany to pay us . 
  it was a respond to all the propaganda about the lazy frauds greeks that all they want is to eat germany 's money . 
  from greece [ a remix of an old \\ ( 1948 \\ ) pop song ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8d2lbsyfea&amp;feature=related ) . 
  ** the lyrics are based on a poem of a young girl that died of tuberculosis and say that : night is coming and darkness is upon earth . 
  a girl alone is wandering around like a shadow . 
  shameless she looks for the sun that now is gone . 
  maybe she 's enchanted by the seashores and the sunsets that enslaved keep her poor heart for ever . 
  or maybe she ' s sunk into madness and then who s gon na ask to know why ... 
  really ? 
  you have to read more blogs ... this picture is on the net before he elected in 2009 . 
  [ he also has been asked for this one and he could n't answer clearly .

  [ here you go ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lucas_papademos ) . 
  i am skeptical to put it nicely . 
  i have a feeling that if people at the economist had him fully serve their interests they would worship him ( even in the same background ) as a god whether they liked him or not . 
  ( and i think he is a deeply corrupted politician ), 
  considering that the new government has the exact same politic ( if not worse in the austerity and the debt measures ) as the former and the fact that this pm is a former banker it may be legitimate but it is far from democratic . 
  also about the leadership of the army that changed last week . 
  some voices say that is because of their denial to suppress the riots . 
  not much democracy either . 
  i think that we are entering a very dank period of our history ( europe and greece as well ), 
  he was the vice president to jean-claude trichet at the ecb from 2002 to 2010 . 
  before that he was governor of the ( non national ) bank of greece from 1994 10 2002 , when greece entered the eurozone with false stats . 
  he was involved to the stock market 's scandal . 
  i can not trust him ( yet , to be well-intentioned and optimist to a point that i 'm bleeding a little bit from the inside ) . 
  edit : let me add that he is a member of the trilateral commission . 
  i do n't know much about this commission but [ here 's what chomsky said about it ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aemxm6fw_ve ) . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.welt.de/politik/article13706612/us-papier-enthuellt-deutsche-euro-fehleinschaetzung.html ), 
  the average greek was not much informed . 
  there were ( and still are ) blogs and web pages that had analysis about what was going on but a ) they were read by a small percentage and b ) the terms that now have been in our every day life like spread and imf were unknown words . 
  in addition to this the vast majority of the media are property of people that have interests not to inform people in a way that they could vote for somebody else than the two parties that are in power for 30 years now . 
  the parties of the left have spoken of these problems but they are in such inter-party decadence that nobody could trust them plus impunity was spread in all levels , in the highest first and foremost and the lower less but still tangible in a way that they would be partners in crime but not equally share the cake ... 
  i thought in roman empire were the ( ancient ) italians who controlled every body else ... 
  i wish we could do the same as you but it seems that we can not . 
  we are in the eurozone and furthermore our geographical position is critical ...
