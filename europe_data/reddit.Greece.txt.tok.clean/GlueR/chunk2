  i simplified for clarity . 
  of course it 's more complicated than that . 
  what i write here is for the scope of the article posted here . 
  the imf takes the role of a consultant in this article and i make the presumption that the report is indeed not written with an agenda in mind . 
  i simply clarify the role that the imf chooses to play in order to make this specific assessment . 
  it depends on who the decision maker , the stakeholder and the consultant are in each model . 
  i 'll give an example . 
  * a is the decision maker * b is the stakeholder and a 's husband and * c is the consultant , a friend of a. 
  a is in an abusive relationship , so c proposes that a should leave b. 
  if c is a consultant of b , b is the decision maker , and b says that a is constantly crying and is unhappy , which makes him unhappy as well , c would propose that b should stop abusing a. 
  in this case , imf is the consultant . 
  it proposes that if greece is the decision maker and the rest of the eurozone is unaffected by its proposals , greece might have been better off if it left in 2010-2011 . 
  on the other hand , greece might not have been better off if it left in 2010-2011 , if the decision maker is the rest of the eurozone and they chose to handle the greek crisis differently . 
  for anyone wondering how the hell everyone has isis fighters per capita  1 , in the sense that as it 's presented , there are more isis fighters than citizens for each country , the paper first of all does n't use the term `` per capita '' for this metric and second , without making it absolutely clear in the tables , it mentions that these are isis fighters per million inhabitants in the text . 
  i guess that the article based on the paper took some liberties . 
  it does ** sound ** like it , but i know very little , like most , about the actual case file , so i do n't feel i 'm morally entitled to an opinion here . 
  i 'm not a judge or a lawyer and i wo n't pretend to be one or the other , but as far as i can tell , he was convicted for not notifying the board that he was sending the data , as he was supposed to , according to the prosecution , not for not asking for permission to send them . 
  i do n't know if this is some kind of witch-hunting , but i 'm sure we 'll see what will happen in the court of appeals . 
  opinions , opinions , opinions , yet not a mention on the grounds for the conviction . 
  by ommitting it , the article just takes it for granted that this is a political prosecution and starts rumbling on about what a political prosecution of a statistician means . 
  someone could believe it to be one , but not without having the full story first . 
  not like this biased article does . 
   greece 's former chief statistician was convicted on tuesday of `` breach of duty '' for having failed to tell the statistics agency 's board that he had sent greek fiscal data for 2009 to its european counterpart eurostat .

  i know mate . 
  i 'm just kidding . 
  it 's named after its inventor august dvorak , an educational psychologist . 
  u and a are very far away from each other on a qwerty keyboard to press one by mistake instead of the other due to sausage fingers . 
  they are far apart on azerty keyboards , dvorak etc. 
  even if you type on a numeric pad on an old nokia phone . 
  long story short , there is an obscure keyboard layout where a is directly underneath u called [ amuseum ] ( http://shenafu.com/layout.php ) . 
  so , op , be honest here and come forward with the truth . 
  why are you using the amuseum keyboard layout ? 
  can confirm . 
  mid-2013 to mid-2014 was a major year of reforms which lead to the fall of that government and the general elections of january 2015 . 
  well , that 's a somewhat narrow-minded approach to tax evasion . 
  tax rates are adjusted upwards to compensate for tax evasion . 
  if you could magically stop all tax evasion in the country , and lowered tax rates to reflect the change , you 'd get the same net result for the economy , but with a more fair distribution of income among citizens . 
  if on the other hand you stopped all tax evasion and did n't lower tax rates , it would mean that you raised the total taxation , effectively further slowing down the economy . 
  tax evasion is a very important matter to be dealt with , but its measurable effect is n't directly fiscal as the article suggests . 
  it makes investment from new external sources more attractive , since insider 's knowledge is n't necessary to be competitive , less risky and ultimately more profitable . 
  it also makes actual ( and exportable ) productivity more profitable than cheating for the companies already in place . 
  tax evasion is a lot of work by itself , but as long as it is more profitable than doing better work or better products , tax evasion and/or corruption will be the playing field on which entrepreneurs and companies will be competing on . 
  i like this part of the article :  voters often do n't understand how the mechanism works , believing that funding to greece comes out of their pockets . 
  now that leonid got esm all figured out and is smug about it , maybe it 's time he also read a bit of macroeconomics , where there is ** nothing ** you change without affecting a million other things . 
  yes . 
  that was my point . 
  that the amount of the primary surplus requested translates to a general government budget surplus . 
  that 's exactly what i understand of this , but a 2 % surplus ( now they 're saying 2.2 % ) seems to me that it will keep taxes ( e.g. 
  the corporate tax is now 29 % ) this high for longer , which in turn will just keep investors out until the sun stops shining . 
  now , in this clusterfuck of a government we 've got , it might mean that their unwillingness to further reduce public spending ( and thus reduce , or at least sustain taxes ) is the prime reason for this , but at least in the current circumstances , i ca n't see a substantial gdp growth other than what is to be expected as a mid-term rebound after the crisis . 
  if the greek economy does n't achieve a long-term growth rate significantly higher than the average of the eu , the country wo n't be able to catch up with the other eu members ( and be able to reduce its debt to acceptable by the stability and growth pact levels ) . 
  so , when you say that this is a `` feel good calculation '' , i 'm not entirely sure who it is supposed to make feel good , if not , to a certain degree , for satisfying a sense of revanchism . 
  for crying out loud , this year i got introduced to a 38 % insurance rate ( from around 15 % last year ) , which from next year wo n't be even deductible from the 29 % tax rate ( which was 26 % last year ) , plus all the other taxes . 
  why on hell would anyone want to invest their money ( or time ) here , including the greeks themselves ? 
  ( end of my little rant ) yes , of course the gdp will start growing , but at what rate ? 
  the current forecast is for 0.6 % in 2020 with a reduction in unemployment from 23 % to 20 % . 
  with less than 1 % reduction per year in the rebound period , with an output gap of around 10 % ( now at 13 % ) and an inflation in the eurozone of around 1.5 % ( for the foreseeable future , with data up to 2020 ) , the country will be in deadlock , swimming in the mud and under strict monitoring , really until after 2060 . 
  i really ca n't see this policy as being put there to help greece overcome its problem , but rather to sustain and manage it . 
  you are absolutely right , but that would be sensible for the next 3-5 years , to prepare the greek government for the free market . 
  the proposed deal is for a 2 % surplus after that , until 2060 , a calculation that does n't even take inflation into account . 
  i wrote another comment in the same thread that basically says the same thing . 
  these are n't economic decisions ( as they are often portrayed to be ) . 
  they are political . 
  a guy that is n't trusted or someone who does n't trust someone else ca n't be entire nations , except if you 're talking about voters deciding . 
  the kind of trust you 're referring to , which is inherent in economic systems , has to do with a kind of sum of `` gut feelings '' among private investors . 
  the feelings you mentioned , like who owes to whom and if you can trust someone are completely valid in the microeconomic example of the house , but i gave that example stating that i was avoiding to mention the complexities of macroeconomics and i also gave an example of the same nature of a trust issue in an international scale with the treaty of versailles and the marshall plan , that shows how these trust issues can be properly dealt with , using policies that make little sense to voters and a lot of sense to economists . 
  that sentimental way of thinking is n't supposed to apply to policy makers , and that 's why i do n't seem to manage to see any macroeconomic sense in these decisions , but i sure can see the political one . 
  there is no reason to trust the current greek government based on their record , especially due to the massive idiocy of 2015 when they came to power , but the decisions being made these days are for a government surplus of 2.5 % until 2060 . 
  this ca n't be the case if it was for economic reasons , but it also ca n't be to punish/distrust a specific government , because these are for very long after this government is gone . 
  this seems to me like a kind of distrust/prejudice against an entire nation that only makes sense in the same way the treaty of versailles made sense in 1919 . 
  if you 're an elected official in a european country , your primary concern is keeping your voters satisfied , not necessarily ensuring the viability of the eu or its economies . 
  telling your voters that backing an effort to help greece grow is for their own benefit sounds naive , compared to the distrust and punishment . 
  well , everyone praises the marshall plan nowadays . 
  how many remember what it was and why it worked ? 
  i do n't mean that you are a war mongering nationalist or anything like that . 
   that 's why i refer to `` the kind of thinking '' and not you personally . 
  it 's that oversimplification of economics i 'm addressing . 
  it 's the amount of surplus demanded that makes no sense to me for the long run , but it sure makes sense to a lot of people that ca n't or do n't want to understand how national economies work . 
  to make it clearer , i 'm sure that such a hard-line strategy towards greece will make sense to a lot of voters across europe , but it does n't make sense to the imf and economists . 
  that makes sense , but this is supposed to be a long term requirement , for long after the depression is over . 
  if the gdp grows by say 2 % , a reasonable fiscal result ( say around 1 % deficit ) will still lead to a surplus of 1 % . 
  by raising taxes ( so much ) , you drive gdp downwards and then you need an even greater surplus to lower the debt , because the ( relative ) debt is increased just because of the shrinking gdp . 
  shit ... 
  i do n't know . 
  i did macroeconomics in the uni , i 'm trying really hard for years to understand what the actual master plan is , but without inserting politics in the equation , the economics do n't make a lot of sense to me . 
  and that 's the kind of thinking that leads to nationalist movements and wars . 
  but to address your way of approaching this , without mentioning the complexity of macroeconomics , i 'll give you two examples . 
  the first is germany , the treaty of versailles and the marshall plan and the second one is a much simpler one . 
  if there are three people building a house , one owes money to the other two , so the two keep confiscating all his bricks , not only he wo n't be able to pay the debt , because he 's not building anything and wo n't be able to buy any more bricks , but the other two will have to build the house by themselves . 
  this is more or less what the eu is . 
  are you sure ? 
  it seems to me that even if that 's the case , it again translates to a surplus . 
  [ portugal ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/portugal/government-budget ) [ greece ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/government-budget ), 
  that 's amazing for portugal !, 
  sooooo ...  the european commission ( ec ) noted that portugal had reduced its budget ** deficit ** to 2 . l0 % of gross domestic product ( gdp ) in 2016 , which was lower than the 3.0 % target set in the stability and growth pact . 
  anyone care to tell me why [ greece is required to have a 3.5 % budget ** surplus ** ] ( https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/world/europe/2017-05-19-greeces-economy-at-a-crucial-crossroads/ ) ? 
  is n't this just strangling the country 's economy even further ? 
  great stuff !, 
  may i also add that [ 2017 is an official year of cultural exchange between china and greece ] ( http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-04/28/c_136244276.htm ) .
