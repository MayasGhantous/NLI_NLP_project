they are trying to make it work through austerity , because it actually did work for them in the past - when everybody else was booming . 
  now ... it looks like cargo-cult economics , which is absurd , because i believe they are smarter than that in aggregate - so i expect that there is a deeper game afoot . 
  problem is they are trying to make it work for them - and the euro right now is one size fits none . 
  so , they 're making the euro unbearable to everyone else so that everyone else gets out of it ? 
  edit : no , i do n't believe that they do - should i ? 
  i stopped reading at `` even greece [ ... ] is expected to grow faster than france this year '' - greece has been predicted to `` grow next year '' each of the last 8 years ... otoh , it 's an interesting blindness - it does n't matter what you did in the past , what you went through and where you are now , it 's the chance to grow that matters . 
  who benefits from that worldview ? 
  who lives in it ? 
  ... for them . 
  not really . 
  varoufakis explains it as a [ surplus recycling mechanism ] ( http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2011/02/09/what-is-a-surplus-recycling-mechanism-an-idea-going-back-to-bretton-woods/ ) , and the usa has a version of it too among states . 
  no , a lot of these are designed to create a casus belli ... 
  that is a very ... idealistic view of world affairs . 
  that 's because we always had a very fluctuating economy , laws . 
  aside : one of the larger pain points of investors is the tax system which does n't let them evaluate potential performance beyond 12 months . 
  older times the political system would change every x years ; everything is in flux . 
  that makes about as much sense as if all u.s. citizens calling themselves `` native americans '' ... 
  this is it , especially since it 's near a demarcated ingress/egress point for jet skis and other motorized vessels - see the two lines of yellow buoys ? 
  they are removing sand from the bottom of the sea and moving it outside that area so that there 's no chance of the propellers hitting sand . 
  it depends on what you want to do ... 
  most people with a degree are looking into emigrating at least temporarily . 
  the unemployment rate is still at 27 % and even the optimists do n't see it as budging within 2015 . 
  no ; yes ; higher than usual but not high . 
  define terrible :-), 
  it 's the summer season - greece 's economy always grows in september and october . 
  even if the growth is measured year over year , 2013 was very bad for the tourist sector ... 
  they applied austerity and reforms * when interest rates were high and the rest of the eurozone was flourishing * . 
  do these circumstances exist now ? 
  not only that , but the inflation target has been set way too low for half of eurozone ... 
   `` punish '' that sounds like `` the beatings will continue until morale improves '' ... 
  or ... a huge train catapult !, 
  that 's what , 230 km as the crow flies ? 
  will the train be underwater or on a bridge ? 
   ps : i live in istanbul , one of the prime targets for such an attack . 
  i think that turkey is heading into a much more russia-centric orbit , now that the eu has rejected turkey ( or is perceived to do so ) . 
  it makes much more sense for them to participate in russia 's plans . 
   til syriza is the radical left . 
  while i do agree with your analysis , keep in mind that tve [ overton window ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/overton_window ) has shifted so much to the right ( also , it shrunk ! ), 
  - that to all intents and purposes , * today 's * syriza is * today 's * radical , but , as you say , * today 's * syriza is more like * 2009 's * mainstream . . 
  well , at least she does recognize the clusterfuck ; everybody else is crowing about austerity 's success . 
   but printing too much can be detrimental absolutely , but so is printing too little . 
  energy transfer sucks - even with superconductors . 
  what ? 
  there was austerity in greece at least since 2010 , and we had the equivalent of a mini-coup when the then-elected prime minister wanted to do a referendum ... 
  in a private utility , there 's a disincentive to invest when that money can go to shareholders . 
  future be damned , * this * quarter will have exceptional profits . 
  and the next after that , and the next , ad infinitum . 
  why invest in infrastructure when you have a monopoly ? 
  meh , that 's just plain old corruption ; come to greece , where our utility companies run essentially like that , having a legal monopoly on their products . 
  that it 's in the constitution or not is * entirely * besides the point . 
  sounds like everywhere ... 
  at 4 years old , it would have soaked up language , speech style , idioms and pronunciation like a sponge ... 
  of course not . 
  bailouts are for banks only . 
  they already do , even if indirectly - for a lot of city dwellers , their extended family contains a 2nd or 3rd cousin that is a farmer in some village ; some families can only survive by tapping their relatives ' produce . 
  however , a lot of recent legal immigrants ( those that came here in the last 20 years f.e. ), 
  do n't have these kind of connections and since they usually work in unskilled jobs that are currently hit hard , they do n't have this cushion to fall back on . 
  in my area the church has a food kitchen and low-cost produce shop , and when they are open , they have always queues . 
   those fired will receive compensation this comes to about 200 meur , i understand ... 
  not really , this is being pushed by those that pay the most and have the means to do something about it - members of the european parliament . 
  every one of them has felt the costs of roaming . 
  absolutely . 
  still , carriers do have insane profits - after the costs you mention . 
  i 'm technical/administrative staff at the department of mechanical engineering in a greek university ; ~ 30 % of all students speak german , and ~ 50 % feel the need to get out of greece to find work ... 
  i do n't think you can travel with so much cash on hand without tripping all sorts of red flags ; better have a cc/debit on hand . 
  that 's because a lot of pasok party members switched over to syriza as soon as they saw the writing on the wall . 
  that 's partly the reason for its surge in popularity - those party members brought their voters with them . 
  consumer prices are on average 24 % lower in greece than in denmark , but average income is much , much lower ( average greek person gets ~ 35 % of what an average dane makes ) . 
  local purchasing power in greece is 54.68 % lower than in denmark ( source : [ numbeo ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=denmark&amp;country2=greece&amp;displaycurrency=eur ) ), 
  a liter of petrol is 1.6-1 .7 $ in greece right now . 
  when compared to denmark , everything is more expensive relative to income . 
  from [ numbeo ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=denmark&amp;country2=greece&amp;displaycurrency=eur ) : local purchasing power in greece is 54.68 % lower than in denmark, 
  i think this survey tells more about the general obsession of usians with ` the best ' and/or ' 1st place ' than anything else . 
  what kind of second-rate university professor made/accepted this as a final semester project ? 
   statistics : six out of ten greeks below 25 years old are jobless ... and the other four out of ten are students or serving their term in the army . 
  edit : a lot of not-quite-university-level departments will be closing around greece this year ; however the total number of students admitted will not decrease - other departments will take up the slack . 
  as an example , the department i 'm working for will go from 120 students to ~ 300 admitted this september ; it has a headcount of ~ 70 people ( teaching staff + assistants + administrative personell ) ( if the numbers do n't work out for you : it 's an engineering school , 10 semesters , ~ 110 different courses ) . 
  we do n't even have the classroom capacity for this number of students ... 
  see this link : http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=greece&amp;country2=germany&amp;city1=thessaloniki&amp;city2=berlin ( note : neither thessaloniki nor berlin are expensive ) . 
  +197 % median income , but most of everything is more expensive . 
  what has skewed so much the wealth charts is that everyone save germany had a housing bubble that has n't yet deflated ; this , along with the fact that a lot more people are homeowners skew the data . 
  it 's not just the voltage that differs , it 's also the frequency ( 50hz in the eu , 60hz in 100v countries ) . 
  yes , there are transformers , but they will cost more than the unit you 're showing [ ( example ) ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/adaptoo-step-transformer-special-watts/dp/b004w7lvua/ref=sr_1_8?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1366038183&amp;sr=8-8&amp;keywords=110+to+240+transformer ) for the wattage you 'll be needing . 
  try one of the retailers in the eu to ship to your friend directly ( and note that the prices are tax-inclusive ) . 
   the cyprus mail should maybe ask questions of why an economy was built on these foundations because they saw that it was working for the city of london ? 
  ( only partly serious ) . 
  add a link to the post , posts with text are self posts . 
  not really , the primary surplus would evaporate in an instant if the greek government would pay all its obligations to private and public entities within greece - it has effectively defaulted on hospitals , pharmacies , and the construction sector . 
   yet our politicians keep expecting increased tax income income tax has soared . 
  not to mention that receipts are requested by more customers ( due to the minfin requiring a certain amount of receipts before allowing tax deductibles ) . 
  correction : the total deficit for those months is $ 1,35 bn , which is still better that projections . 
  some other tidbits : ~ 3.4 % decrease in expenditures by the government . 
  ~ 33 % increase in income from estate taxes ( i think , please correct me if i 'm wrong ) . 
  ~ 7 % decrease in income from vat - which means there 's at least a 7 % decrease in consumption in greece ... 
  actually , that is more or less what happened , but in a different time frame , and in a more complex wa . 
  see [ this chart ] ( http://www.forexblog.org/2009/04/euro-gains-after-ecb-rate-cuts.html ) which shows the historical ecb rate . 
  now , a simplified version is that germany was in a recession during 2001 - actually , they were still stagnating from the reunification , but in 2001 it was more pronounced [ ( see also the last paragraph here ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/early_2000s_recession#european_union ) . 
  now , germany in 2001 wanted lower rates , and they got them from the ecb ( and independence be damned ) . 
  now , lower rates overheated the southern countries which were used to higher rates , and allowed them to import - and import they did , with a large slice of those imports being exported from germany . 
  now , germany had started the hartz reforms during 2002 iirc , which were a kind of austerity , which explains somewhat their insistence on it for everyone else - `` hey , it worked for us !,
