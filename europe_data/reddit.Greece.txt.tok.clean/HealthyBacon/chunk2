  as we know the romans were pretty bad-ass and they conquered greece in one fell swoop around 100 b.c. 
  ( or that is what i remember ) . 
  so for quite some time , what is now greece , was part of the roman empire . 
  at this point , let me remind you about magna grecia and the fact that until today there is some greek influence in parts of the southern italy . 
  what is happening with the fyrom-macedonia issue , in this example would translate as the following situation . 
  imagine modern greeks raising statues of ancient roman figures all over greece , not by admiration but by basically saying `` look at all these ancient greek people . 
  yes , look at our nation 's history . 
  we are the romans '' . 
  imagine , kids at school being taught this false version of history , being shown maps of a dream for a modern `` magna grecia '' . 
  oh , and bring the greek influence i mentioned earlier to the table . 
  and you fabricate the argument `` look at what they 've done . 
  these people in sicily are greeks . 
  the italians basically took our land . 
  so we 'll name our country sicily , because we are one and the same and we aspire to place our border with italy , there ! '', 
  that is exactly what is happening here . 
  they are claiming a great part of ancient-greek history as their own , they are bringing in the fact that indeed there are slavic cells in some parts of greek macedonia ( the 19th century was a complete mess ) and you have a serious but historically inaccurate nationalistic agenda, 
  i think when talking in eu/un context the country is called fyrom . 
  when you 're talking outside of that conext , everyone uses the name macedonia , or republic of macedonia . 
  the greeks take generally great insult in referring to that country as macedonia , mostly because the claim to that name is n't based purely in the argument `` they can call themselves whatever they want . 
  macedonia has a nice ring to it '' . 
  macedonians base the whole argument on some misinterpretation of history . 
  they have statues of alexander the great and philip all over their country and are taught about ancient macedonia as part of their nation 's history . 
  the truth is however ( and i do n't think there is a single historian in the world to dispute that ) that ancient macedonians like philip and alexander were more of a greek `` tribe '' which grew in power and took control over almost the whole `` greece '' of the time . 
  they engaged on a war against the persians and conquered the greater part of the then-known world . 
  so , yes , part of fyrom was indeed part of ancient macedonia as was almost the whole world . 
  in egypt , alexander became a pharaoh . 
  i do n't see any egyptians appropriating greek history . 
  the problem for greeks is n't the name on its own . 
  the problem is the false historical argument on which the claim of the name is based . 
  greeks have handled the situation miserably on all fronts and i am glad that more and more people get actually interested in learning about this dispute and listening to both sides of the story, 
  he actually referred to `` ottoman scientists '', 
  i agree , it is indeed taken out of context . 
  however , i do n't believe you can say that , in any context, 
  the phrase was clearly stated . 
  and if you 're a deputy minister of foreign affairs , that 's not a phrase you can state . 
  or you are a joke of a politician serving in a joke of a cabinet, 
  possibly to your surprise , in the current `` regime '' becoming a minister or a high-level government official in greece , does n't require any real qualifications, 
  you are right . 
  you ca n't really take anything my country does seriously , but i just wanted to expose another aspect of the farce we 've been living for the past year or so, 
  i 'd say cyprus . 
  we speak the same language ( and we 're the only ones around the world that speak greek ) have pretty much the same traditions and have been really close allies during the past years . 
  however , i think that greek-cypriots are trying to distance themselves from greece and that 's for their benefit . 
  oh yes , the name is used frequently in greece . 
  alexander , socrates , hercules , aristotle , pericles are few names that come to mind, 
  i do n't get it :(, 
  here in greece we used to have olympic airways ( which a few years ago was absorbed by aegean airlines ) which was the flag-carrier and a public-held company for many years . 
  it was founded by aristotle onassis if i 'm not mistaken some time during his golden years . 
  olympic airways had its golden age many years ago , actually i was n't old enough to notice at the time . 
  people still talk about the cutlery used in the planes , the quality of the food , the gorgeous stewardesses ( as a matter of fact the late ex-pm andreas papandreou [ married one ] ( http://www.mixanitouxronou.gr/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/liani.jpg ) quite a few years younger than him ( also , some [ very-nsfw-18 + ] ( http://www.petraskandalou.com/813/%ce%b1%cf%81%cf%87%ce%b5%ce%af%ce%bf-%ce%bf%ce%b9-22-%ce%b1%cf%80%ce%b1%ce%b3%ce%bf%cf%81%ce%b5%cf%85%ce%bc%ce%ad%ce%bd%ce%b5%cf%82-%cf%86%cf%89%cf%84%ce%bf%ce%b3%cf%81%ce%b1%cf%86%ce%af%ce%b5%cf%82/ ) pics of her which made national news at the time ) and [ his hand gesture ] ( http://www.protothema.gr/images/imagehandler.ashx?m=anchoredfit&amp;f=ly8xmc4ymdeumtaumjmwl3byd2vizgf0ys9mawxlcy8xlziwmtuvmtevmdivbmv5bweuanbn&amp;t=0&amp;w=820&amp;h=457&amp;a=center ) that introduced her to the greek public has made national history ) . 
  however , all that were in vain because it was just made possible by the tax money of the greek population . 
  the workers ' union of olympic had such a hold of politicians that they ended up with huge salaries and even greater pensions . 
  the deficit of the company was too much for the greek economy to handle so it was privatized . 
  the pensioner privileges still remain though . 
  so yeah , i am not very fond of all that, 
  yeah , that 's true . 
  to be honest though , whatever i pick , it probably is above my country in every statistic possible, 
  please !, 
  do n't you take finland away from me . 
  i always use finland as an example when talking to my fellow greeks . 
  : looking for alternatives to bringing up finland in every conversation, 
  so , from what you got and from what you may have read here , how would you define someone who 's left syria to flee from war , has actually fled war ( by reaching turkey ) , has crossed the borders to greece and now demands ( two people attempted suicide today in victoria sq. 
  in athens because they can not leave greece ) to travel to germany ? 
  thank you for this detailed post . 
  the way i see it many of the people we refer to as refugees are also part migrants . 
  and that brings a whole new set of arguments to the table , especially regarding the role of turkey in all this, 
  i 've been reading here about the situation in germany and sweden and actually recently saw a video were a mayor tells the people to not provoke the refugees who harass schoolgirls and try to avoid that part of town . 
  i understand that the situation , mostly in these two countries , is getting out of hand . 
  in part , they have the blame of leading a movement of `` hey refugees !, 
  please come !, 
  we welcome you ! '', 
  without previously making sure that they can cope with that . 
  refugees and immigrants start swarming germany and suddenly ( i think especially after the new years eve incident in koln ) everyone wakes up and says `` shit . 
  what have we done ? 
  quickly , shut everything down !, 
  as for the greeks , they are between life and death anyway , so just give them a deadline and see what 'll come after that . 
  in the meantime , create a european border in fyrom/macedonia '' . 
  what could have happened instead is the following : get a deal with turkey , have the hotspots there under both turkish and european supervision . 
  the ones that qualify for the refugee status , should be taken to greece by ships and then shared between all eu countries by population . 
  everything organised , everything registered . 
  now everyone goes into a sinking boat , gets rescued , many of them provide false identities and everyone is going to germany and the eu is erdogan 's hostage to do as he pleases . 
  the problems that have already arose in germany and sweden are really hard to fix . 
  the least they could do is admit they should have taken measures a lot sooner . 
  it is a matter of social cohesion , fear , financial cost . 
  maybe with greece 's sea-borders out of the equation the influx will be reduced . 
  the problems already at hand , are not so easy to deal with however . 
  it 's just too little , too late, 
  exactly . 
  the symbolic value really matters . 
  could n't have said it better . 
  i live in athens but being a part of the union helps me feel that i have something in common with the average german , italian , french , dutch . 
  we all have something in common , something to believe in and something to work for . 
  if the next day finds greece out of the core of europe , i will just feel isolated . 
  an average greek , living the greek misery . 
  i know it 's not trending here , but many people want to identify themselves as europeans . 
  for these people , that is a really hard hit, 
  again and again . 
  even though , as i said before , the greek borders can not be guarded as well as borders on land . 
  on land , you can just build a fence and nothing passes through . 
  when you find a sinking boat however , you are obligated to collect the passengers and move them to safety . 
  this is how thousands of people have come to greece so far .
