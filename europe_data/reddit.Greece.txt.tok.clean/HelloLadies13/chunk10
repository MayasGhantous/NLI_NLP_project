  of course greece is to blame ... noone denies that.but we got the momerandum because they told as that in 2 years we will start growing and they failed twice already with their predictions and everytime they were taking more and more austerity measures.do u know that my boss has the right to do not pay me ( 500.000 greeks havent been payed for 1 year ) . do u know what means that ?? 
  ? they literally destroyed my economy in order to save their banks . 
  it wasnt ... in order to raise 0.7 % of gdp for the first time and create a virtual surplus the old government stopped paying its debt to the citizens [ greek source ] ( http://www.tovima.gr/relatedarticles/article/?aid=126235 ) . 
  before 2-3 days someone had foreigh links if you search the posts that are related to greece you will find out . 
  hello idiot , its me , your iq.recently , i am dropping because the medias is fucking your mind.do something !!, 
  [ they tried and failed ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/05/imf-underestimated-damage-austerity-would-do-to-greece ) and now they want more.moreover , they didnt try to save greeks but the european banks . 
  insanity : doing the same thing over and over again , expecting different results . 
  did they care when people started to suicide in greece ?? 
  ? did they care when people started to get 500 euros and pay 800 per month ?? 
  ? did they care that pensioners take 300 euros pension and most of them pay for their kids ?? 
  ? did they care that 30 % of people dont have job ?? 
  ? did they care when 500.000 young people left greece ?? 
  ? why i should care for them ?? 
  i am counting on it . 
  i dont downvote anyone , never.moreover , have u any source about 20 + years prediction ?? 
  ? but let it be ... i prefer it.maybe my children will have a future . 
  as i said ... you have a chance to restart your economy.every 6 months we take more austerity measures.the economy will never grow in ** this ** european logic . 
  with 40 % unemployment ... yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh !!!, 
  ! it will be beautiful !!, 
  ! at least if you leave euro u have a chance to restart your economy.its up to you . 
  what a beautiful world !!, 
  ! i need one of these machines right now because i ve got 30 euros left and i have to return to my parents ' house ( i am student and i study away from home ) . 
  did u see any improvement of greek situation ? 
  ? the imf made so many mistakes and they want to make more.stop comparing greece with spain , ireland and italy.see the measures that each country took and u will understand the difference . 
  i didnt sleep well ... in fact i wanted to go out for a drink when i heard about referendum.i stayed home because i wanted to hear the news.i slept at 10 oclock in the morning and i have to say that the greek propaganda is huge !!, 
  ! you cant imagine ... 
  in fact they say repeatedly to people to vote `` yes '' and they dont even analyze the proposition of the creditors or try to inform the people about what might come if they vote `` no '' . 
  what they say in your country about the situation ?? 
  ? our countries are connected in many ways and in fact an even worse situation will affect your people that work here . 
  what is mysterious with referendum ?? 
  ? its the purest form of democracy.it is called `` direct democracy '' . 
   i am wondering if that 's how things are supposed to work in a democratic country . 
  [ category : referendums in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:referendums_in_europe ), 
  it is called `` direct democracy '' and thx god someone gave me the right to choose . 
  30 % unemployment ,40 % already cut pensions ( institutions wants more ) ,1 million people have undeclaire jobs ,30 % shrunk economy ,30 % shrunk public sector , huge taxation that raises the prices , closes the shops and doesnt allow to anyone to open a new one , suicides , people are starving , people are looking for food at the garbage ... do u know the feeling of getting 500 euros when you work 12 hours per day and in the end of the month to pay 800 ?? 
  ? and they want much more ... 
  well that 's true ... moreover the time is for people < 40 ( its five in the morning here ) but 11.000 people are too many for greece.we ll see ... 
  nah ... the last 2-3 years they drift away.as long as erdogan has power i dont think that it is possible ( just a personal opinion ), 
  how about fuck you ? 
  so from 3.000.000 more million people noone will vote syriza ... yep.you are right ... btw polls work at this way.moreover , as i said we already had a result and the statistic false is to prevent the mistakes caused by other factors.your logic is ridiculus ... 
  dude ... i gave statistic exams before 3 days ... its 2,246,064 at 6.330.786 = 36.3 % now its ** 2,246,064 +36.3 % of 9.900.000-6 .330.786 at 9.900.000 = x ** + / - the ** statistic false ** its 34.3 % to 38.3 % ... thats how statistic works if you have already a result ... ur maths suck, 
  this is not how statictic work ... 
  afraid of what ?? 
  ? of 10 panic people running to the atm ?? 
  ? how many more ??? 
  1.000 all night ?? 
  ? there are 5 million in athens and its friday night ... 
  i am pretty aware of my descision ... its not about revenge.its about surviving.with austerity measures every 6 months i wont ... i prefer to die because i chose to . 
  not at all ... greeks voted them because they couldnt stand more austerity.i didnt ... now if i had a second chance i would.i am tired and depressed of this shit.i am bored of being the slut of imf.they gave me a huge loan just to save their banks and pretended that they saved me while all their predictions were wrong.no ... no more of this shit . 
  as i said before : `` if i am to die just to pay them back , i would rather kill them from the first place '' ... 
  because `` mitsosgate13 '' wants him in prisson ... :d, 
  nop ... people are really afraid of leaving the euro ... it will be 70-30 i guess . 
  i just translated a small part.but its true it is just a speculation ... 
  [ it 's here ... but its greek language ] ( http://www.iefimerida.gr/news/214040/trito-paketo-me-50-dis-eyro-vlepei-dnt-mono-etsi-einai-viosimo-hreos ) a quick translation at the best part ( sorry for my english , i hope you understand ) : ** according to an analysis that was leaked to reauters , the predictions about the potential of greek debt was wrong.of course everyone who thinks that this is because of the long-negotiations is naive.from last year , when the last analysis of sustainability establized , the mark was 7 % higher at 117,2 % instead of 110 % of gdp at 2022 even before the period of the high suprluses ( 4,5 % ) starts , combined with 3,5 % rate of growth . 
  ** ** according to imf , the worst senario which is the dominant , at 2022 the debt will be at 142,2 % of gdp , 25 points higher than the last predictions.what means that ?? 
  ? that there will be a gap of 50bn **, 
  greek medias : imf wants to give 50 bn more.good ... 50 bn more ... who is gon na pay them ... 
  sorry ... but this is how democracy works.moreover , in greece we all know that the result will be the same . 
  these link has only the scandals from 2003-2008 ... we are talking for billions and they are 45 . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.zougla.gr/blog/article/534741 ) . lets dont speak about the previous years or the scandas we dont know . 
  i didnt vote for tsipras too ... but to support pasok or nd is a crime.do u want facts ?? 
  [ take them ] ( http://www.zougla.gr/blog/article/534741 ) . 
  scream him down obviously ... 
  oh fuck it ... you dont know a thing about greece.there are 2 reasons greece is in this situation.nd and pasok.if you are greek u are idiot , if u are not you are ignorant . 
  fuck the new democracy you dont know a fucking thing about them and how the looted the country for decades !!!!!!!!!!!!!!, 
  there was a graph before 1-2 weeks here with imf 's predictions about greece ... both predictions for memorandums were really bad.moreover , in order to create a surplus in the second memorandum the country stop paying the citizens.for example they owe 30.000 euros to my father and he just had 2 bookshops.and lets dont mention that they wanted more austerity measures this january and thats why the government felt . 
  [ debates in reddit for greece is like this ] ( http://9gag.com/gag/2681884/the-truth-about-greece ), 
  there are many alternative ways in economics.moreover , when you see that this way doesnt work and every 3-4 months greece struggles to give u back ur money u should understand that something is wrong . 
  ah ... i dont think if the word `` occupation '' is proper.i mean posession of the country.i hope that is the right word.she was 10 when germans came to greece.i heard a lot of stories for that period . 
  what if the `` greek actions '' that imf wants are wrong like the previous `` actions '' ?? 
  my grandma doesnt feel insulted and believe me she saw much death and fire at the ~ ~ occupation ~ ~ posession of greece . 
  both proposals just suck.it 's the end boys.it is good , it is submissive ( maybe some of you will get erections ) but we wont be able to stand it.i really want to see the predictions of the imf for the unemployment etc. . . if they have any . 
  i started smoking at 16 and i am greek ... aweful habbit ... especially with this crisis.according to a survey 40 % of greeks are smokers . 
  all will be alright ... if something happens u wont realize it in mykonos.i guarantee that . 
  the prices skyrocketed here too but if they put payment to educate your self probably we will have war here . 
  yep ... 
  really ?? 
  ? at least in greece is free ( for now ... ), 
  i will invite you at thessaloniki at the winter neighboor ... dont worry.we will make a huge hug all together to get warm :d, 
  you guys in germany get so much brain-war from medias that your opinions are abstain from the rest of the world . 
  you pay for your university ?? 
  ? its private ?? 
  in greece we have nothing to talk about :p, 
  this post will fill me with depression ... 
  hahahaha ... that 's the answer i was expecting ... i take everything back :p, 
  thats the only comparison you can make ... what u want ?? 
  ? to compare ch with a political newspaper ? 
  your humor level is equal to merkel 's beauty level ... zero . 
  what a surprise ... -_-, 
  whatever dude ... i meant `` degree '' :p, 
  seriously ... i cant remember anything !!, 
  ! i am so sad :(, 
  lazy fucks ??? 
  [ greeks work more hours than every other european country ] ( http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=anhrs ), 
  i just dont want to imagine how many people will lose their jobs.i guess 1 year from now we will have reach 30 % -32 % ... i hope i am wrong . 
  when i do these comments i get downvoted because i am greek ... when you do you get upvoted like shit . 
  racism in / r/europe is real . 
   and if not for corruption in greece that would have happened . 
  if you fire 8.000 taxmen ofc we will have corruption.moreover imf said that he miscalculated the multipliers ... he said nothing about curroption . 
  no reason to take seriously a guy that called one of the greatest economists of the last century `` dickhead '' and asked `` why he still has a job '' while their theories affect our lives right now .
