  your awareness at economics is equal to your iq.both dont exist . 
  competitive economy ... i hear these 2 fucking words since 2010 ... nothing changed even if we did everything the imf wanted.they failed twice with their predictions and they apologised for austerity.now here we are waiting for the next dumb prediction . 
  raising the unemployment even more wont give u back your money.your answer is so simplistic.you think cutting pensions and in long-terms wages to private sector will help greece to pay you back.no dude ... that means that even less people will be able to pay taxes and the income of the country will be decreased even more . 
  you can be glad as much you want ... noone cares . 
  to elimination ?? 
  ? probably we are really close.i am also happy that you are glad . 
  `` who cares if people are dying ... they will pay '' ... right ??? 
  good job man ... 
  you mean the [ greeks that work more hours than every other european country ] ( http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=anhrs ) ?? 
  ? maybe you mean the greeks that [ pay taxes even without income ] ( http://www.worldwide-tax.com/greece/greece_tax.asp ) . but probably you mean the [ greeks with the highest retirement age in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/retirement_age ) bild did her job ... 
  yes its true that that the default will be not slightly worse but really worse.still ... in the end it will be the same.there is no political party in greece that could make the difference.seriously ... 
  both are bad ... the situation in greece is so suffocating that only a good agreement could help syriza.but the government wont fall for sure.i believe syriza will be first whatever happen unless if we see a new political party at the next years . 
  the real problem is that troika 's agreement probably wont be accepted from the national parliament . 
  well ... in greece right now we dont have opposition.the second party is new democracy which according to surveys if we had elections now will had the vote of the 19 % -20 % of the people while syriza 35-40 % ( some surveys say more ) . 
  maybe all europeans flame syriza but unfortunately its the best we have.nd was destroying and was looting the country for 40 years ( with pasok that thx god is at 3 % now ) . only the people that had/have benefits from them vote them.the other parties just dont exist . 
  just to know ... if syriza bring a really bad agreement in greece probably golden dawn will benefit ... this is sad . 
  its simple ... the answer is not difficult ... what is behind the answer is difficult to understand . 
  ** japan can pay , greece doesnt ** industry , imports , exports , trust , growth etc are the reasons.actually the whole economical system of japan is the reason :p, 
  no idea ... probably they will ask the people ( referendum ) . 
  oh god ... cant wait for the unemployment to climb at 35 % ... 
  ofc they dont ... they just want to delay it as much as possible . 
  well ... i guess the vocabulary.the variety of words in greek language is huge ... we dont learn most of them.however this is a benefit ( every word gives a different sense even if the meaning doesnt change ) for poems etc and thats why when i see a greek poem translated i feel depressed because i feel that the meaning is not the same . 
  say that to imf which completely fucked the labor market.almost 500.000 greeks havent been payed for 1 year and the law dont touch the bosses because imf wanted us to be more ... competitive . 
  dude ... from the whole different prices u chose the 10 % ?? 
  ? also , u want 11 million people to buy from albania ?? 
  ? do u know that in 26 % of taxation there is some extra 2k per year from enfia ? 
  ? let it ... you dont understand if you dont live here . 
  moreover i didnt sent you this for the comparison but to explain to you why the pension system is suddenly such a problem . 
  well ... i ve answered at this too many times.lets do this one more . 
  1 ) [ the cost of living in albania is way lower than in greece ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=greece&amp;country2=albania&amp;city1=athens&amp;city2=tirana ) 2 ) [ tax rate in greece is way higher than albania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tax_rates_of_europe ) moreover read [ this ] ( http://news.sky.com/story/1504923/greek-pensions-q-and-a-too-generous ), 
  the pensions ' cut that was done at 2012 is uncostitutional and i dont know how we will get away from the law.moreover , most pensioners can barerly survive.they also want to raise the drugs ' vat from 6 to 12 % , the electrisity frm 13 % to 23 % and the food to an anknown persentage.oldpeople wont survive ... their pensions is cut by 40 % already . 
  yep ... but we reached that point that pensions are the only source of money for private sector ... and this is bad . 
  i didnt say the opposite ... but the question `` this guy still has a job '' sticked to my mind.i study economics and i ve seen his work ( 1 part until now ) and i can not accept that this guy who actually just hates greece dared to talk like this for krugman without having any clue not only about economics , but about krugman too . 
  imf missed it 's predictions . 
  do you know anything about krugman ?? 
  ? do you know that he is one of the best economists of the last century ?? 
  ? about his nobel , his new theories that changed economy ??? 
  [ read and learn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=paul_krugman ), 
  this is not new ... oli rhen said that years ago . 
   it 's not a matter of how much land , it 's a matter of which . 
   there are russian speakers outside of russian borders . 
  good ... there are greek speakers all over the world ... the world belongs to us . 
  are u serious ?? 
  well ... i dont know for chemtrails but they can make 30.000 ( until now only in greece ) people suicide for sure . 
  the imf is actually trying to control death/birth rate in europe . 
  even the older people do not but maybe they didnt do their homework when they were younger :p . my point is that in greece we dont learn english at school ( the level is really low ) . there are private teaching schools ( there are too expensive but everyone goes there ) . they teach you purposeful english just to take 1-2 degrees.in my opinion thats bad too ... look at me.its hard for me to communicate confortably.also , in my university at the first 4 semesters there is a lesson `` english for economists '' ( i study economics ) . you dont have any kind of this in russia ? 
  for some reason in russia you dont learn english.in my free time i like to play 1 game of dota ( its a videogame ) which is full of russians and they dont have a clue.the only phrases they say is `` obama banana '' and `` fuck you '' . 
  i think for greeks the hardest aspect is phrasal verbs.moreover , it 's hard that we can not use the word `` malaka '' . 
  in ireland ...  i dont understand why most of you think that ireland , greece , italy , spain and cyprus are in the same boat.unfortunately greece suffers a lot more . 
  270 a week in greece ?? 
  ? jesus ... his grandmother wasnt a bank principal . 
  i study economics and i have to say that it 's because of him even before he join syriza.one day saw this [ small documentary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwy89zuqwdc ) and i spent 1 whole night reading his site.i bewitched with economy . 
  believe me ... you cant say the world `` same '' for every party when you compare them to pasok and nd.they took billions euros of the people.i really prefer to die than to see them rule again.i dont give a fuck anymore about eu.i know that my country is in depression and will be for many more years.sooner or later i will have to migrate or i will die from hunger . 
  just to remind you that the eu had refused the proposal because they wanted more.moreover i prefer to kill my self than trust the guys that literally destroyed my country . 
  just to remind you that before the previous government leave they had announce pension cuts/increased vat and 10 more austerity measures.so it will be the same . 
  you know something ?? 
  ? i live here ... i dont need the goverment to tell me that we have 36 % taxrate and noone can open a business.i dont need the goverment to say that we ve got 27 % unemployment and 50 % youth because i live hear.i dont need the goverment to say that the avarage salary is 600 euros because i live here.i dont need the goverment to say that 1 million people have undeclare job which pay them for 250 euros per month because i live here.i dont need the goverment to tell me that the suicides are doubled because i used to live in a town with the biggest waterfal in greece and i ve seen people make freefalls.i dont need the goverment to tell me that the public sector shrunk by 30 % because i see that we have lack of doctors and teachers . 
  fuck you then ... you dont know a fucking thing about greek economy . 
  at least he tried way more than everyone else.i dont forget the `` yes sir '' of the previous financial minster, 
  well , you didnt even know how much greece must pay per year and u already have opinion.you make idiotic thoughts and express them in a sarcastic and simplistic way.i do not support syriza but at this time there is no other political party to take his place.moreover noone said that the money from the deal will be enough to pay anything.at least some jobs will be created . 
  you are watching too much tv ... 
  he doesnt need to tell me ... i already know it . 
   merkel is the chancellor of germany and not emperor of europe really ... ?? 
  ? aha ... i believe that everyone know that merkel 's call and willing is `` slightly '' more important than everyone 's else . 
  `` slightly '' ... -_-, 
   usually two sides negotiate , find some agreement and both parties go home declaring victory . 
  probably , this is why greek economy sucks . 
  oh shut up ... you are making sarcastic comments all the time when you clearly dont have any idea for what is going on . 
  ehm ... what u mean `` if '' ?? 
  ? he already succeed . 
  if you attack russia you will start a ww3 for sure ... nato will join , maybe a couple of countries will support russia ( why not china ??? ), 
  and kim jong un will have fun pressing his red buttons ( woops ... you forgot him ? ), 
  well ... i dont have words to describe how dumb this post is.can u give me a source of all these nonsenses that came out of your dumb head ?? 
  us and eu dont like it ... i dont know how they pushed bulgaria not to do it . 
  why are u telling bullshits when you dont know anything ?? 
  what ?? 
  there is a payment in advance of 3bn but only greek medias mention it for some reason.so i dont know if it is true . 
  got it ... this is the reaction i was expecting.so , how did he gain all this power and this infuence to the common people ?? 
  ? from my experiance ( i ve been in turkey twice and i have some friends ) expept from the sympathy he gains from `` hardcore '' muslims , many people hate armenians and kurds ( we all know about this `` conflict '' ) . does he take advantage of this fact by any means ?? 
  thats why i failed twice at michigan 's c2 exams ... 
  yes, 
  2bn is the payment in advance ... but i dont think we know the whole amount . 
  what people think for him ?? 
  ? i guess the `` hardcore '' muslims support him and the most `` liberals '' do not ?? 
  no offence but i always thought that erdogan is rulling turkey no matter what ... i guess that i was wrong.i clearly remember a big scandal last year with erdogan and his son but nothing happend.how did he apologise ?? 
  start smoking at sixteen ... thx god i dont live in hawaii, 
  wrong link my friend . 
   may 2 , 2010 : after days of frantic talks , the imf and eu agree to a $ 110bn rescue package over three years . 
  the agreement is followed by a 48 hour strike , with three people killed after a bank is set on fire . 
   june 15 , 2011 : speculation and fear from both markets and the greek population turns violent . 
  the failure of europe to resolve their disagreements over the greek debt crisis combines to rattle credit markets again on wednesday and thursday . 
  [ are the european banks saving greece or saving themselves ? 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/22/greece-european-banks-eurozone ), 
  you are trying so hard to excuse the dumbest loan in the world history.dont try this hard ... accept the fact that both eu and greece ( the goverment of pasok ) sucked hard those days . 
  indeed ... we are a union ... remember ? 
  92 % of the money never came to greece . 
  i hope it does ... but who cares ... economic war is what germany likes :p ... i am kidding of course, 
  thats what i said ... 
  greece has the best pilots in the world ... germany has 7th pilots in the world 2 . greece has best seals in the europe and 4th in the world !, 
  3 . greece have z ' mak who are the best commandos unit in the europe one thing that we are capable to do is war ... unfortunatly ...
