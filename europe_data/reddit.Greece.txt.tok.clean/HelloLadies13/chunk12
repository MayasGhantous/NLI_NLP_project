  ** gifts ** ... yes you are right ... giving me money that are actually recycling to your bank system and i ve never seen them its gift.anyone wants to have 300 bn dollars dept. . . 
  yes ... because we chose to take the biggest loan in global history.noone forced us . 
  congratulations ... imf might hire you.they clearly want minds like yours . 
  greeks avoid taxes because they cant pay them but of course there is curruption too ( like everywhere ) but mainly because of the previous fact.they cant pay . 
  there are many greeks ( around 500.000 ) that can not open a business because they owe money . 
  noone told you to pay from the first place . 
  you actually renamed greek proposal as troika 's ... you are a bit confused . 
  free money , the money that save your banks ? 
  ? shame on you ... 
  economy doesnt work like this.there are thousands of methods that can solve a problem because of the thousands components.this is basic economics.just both sides stick to their plans ignoring that we are speaking about a country . 
  i can tell you hundreds-thousands of economists with different opinions about how can greece start growing without austerity.moreover , the problem with the austerity we have in greece is that we dont earn enough to pay back because the income from taxes is decreasing . 
  i dont believe that there is only back and white.there must be a `` middle road '' . 
  tsipras has told many times that his promises will be canceled and that he is hopping that he can make them until the end of the goverment ( 3,5 years from now ) . moreover he has made some of them which mainly unblocked the amount of the money that the people couldnt give to the country and country is taking some cash from them . 
  [ austerity didnt work until now ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/02/26/the-reason-austerity-in-greece-didnt-work/ ) and even the [ imf admitted that it failed ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/05/imf-underestimated-damage-austerity-would-do-to-greece ) . i cant see why further austerity can work . 
  we reached a point with 27 % unemployment and 50 % youth unemployment.every austerity measure means that less people will be able to pay taxes and the income of the country will be decreasing.our economy shrunk by ** 30 % ** the last 5 years.our public sector shrunk 30 % and now we dont even have enough doctors and teachers . 
  now the only real source of money for the private sector ( that imf destroyed ... we dont even have labor protection , many workers havent been payed ** for years ** ) is the pensions.this is really bad but we didnt choose it.if you cut more pensions , you destroy even more the private sector and in long terms the public sector.one million people in greece have undeclear job.can you imagine the number ?? 
  ? one million !!, 
  ! more than 400.000 people left greece the last 5 years and suicides are doubled !!, 
  ! taxation is huge and noone can open a business . 
  how can i trust imf and how can austerity work ?? 
  you are not sorry ... you dont even care as you didnt care for so many things that happend around the world.the only thing you care about is to split at the massive grave of one country . 
  stop telling me what your damn tv is saying.most of these things cant even exist here.your post is full of simplistic answers without any effect on a destroyed economy.even the imf said that it failed and you keep telling me bullshits about austerity as they already forgot that they admitted . 
  yes ... 
   because if you do n't you will default , and exit the eurozone and eu and have financial ruin that will last for decades . 
  are u ten years old ?? 
  ? nice economical terms ... congratiolations.so you recommend slow death and a slow elimination of the country rather than default ?? 
  ? as i said in another post . 
  `` if i am going to die just to pay you back , i ld rather kill me self now '' . 
  so the economical situation that a country must be is determining by her neighbors.well , say that to italy , spain and mexico.i am bored to explain why greece has more potential than albania , fyrom and bulgary . 
  moreover i dont even care about the goverment.i dont want to see more people die and that is why imf and europe are causing the last 5 years before the new goverment.why the hell are u even talking about now.thx god someone said that we can not stand more death anymore . 
  explain to me with economical terms how further austerity will help greece . 
  i appreciate the story of your grandma and i feel really sorry for her . 
  but the point is that noone can own a business because of the huge taxation.you know ... businesses are closing , not opening.here is my answer to a romanian fellow that was rude and was telling me something about `` fuck you , i hope you will feel real poverty etc. '', 
   1 ) [ taxation is way higher in greece than romania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tax_rates_of_europe )  2 ) [ unempolyment in greece is 3,5 times higher than romania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_in_europe_by_unemployment_rate )  3 ) gpd for greece is reducing while romania 's is increasing ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:gdp_per_capita_at_current_market_prices,_2003_and_2013_ ( % c2 % b9 ) _ ( eu-28 _ % 3d_100 ; _ based_on_pps_per_inhabitant ) _ yb15.png )  4 ) [ the cost of living is way lower in romania than in greece ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=greece&amp;country2=romania )  5 ) 1 million people in greece have 1 undeclared job you know ... greece can not grow at this situation.every 6 months we have austerity measures.every six months the market is lossing his stability ( ehm ... what is this actually ??? ), 
  and we got the biggest loan of global history on our arms.we are not rich because we have 600 euros avarage salary.we pay 800 for taxation + rent + bills etc. . . you understand the difference i think . 
  you know the only city i miss from the old times that i used to travel much is salzburg ... i want to live there ... 
  shoot us with euros probably :d why are u all making this coversantion ??? 
  i will keep making fun and tell you that we dont need your fuel.our rockets can do the job :d, 
  i dont want to make this conversation ... if you like that church dont pay taxes at all ok ... 
  do you really think that greece was taking discussions the last 5 years ?? 
  ? here in greece we are calling ourselves `` a dept colony '' . 
  the value of the acres of the greek church are estimated to be [ 22 billions ] ( http://www.protagon.gr/?i=protagon.el.article&amp;id=40277 ) ... lets dont speak about the relics , cash etc. . . 
   reforms the improvement or amendment of what is wrong , corrupt , unsatisfactory , etc. 
  : is cutting a 300-350 euros pension while increasing the drugs ' vat from 6 % to 12 % / the electricity from 13 % to 23 % / the food to unknown percentage a reform or elimination of the population ?? 
  ? i dont know ... i am just asking . 
  obviously , the citizens have benefits from tourism ( lower vat , money flowing etc. . . ) and the people that are actually there have money to go vacations :d . ok ... dont make it look this bad.i ll go to italy next month with my gf ... we are not rich.our families can barely sustain us but we managed to keep some money for this the last 8 months . 
  btw santorini is maybe the most expensive place in greece ... you wont meet poor people there . 
  what they did ?? 
  oh , boy ... another sad story . 
  golden dawn --  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golden_dawn_ ( political_party ), 
  i wont tell you that i hope you suffer as much as we do because i am good person.at least dont be so idiot.we are speaking for 11 million people here . 
  there are many enities but they are not enough.almost half of greeks live under the limit of poverty or are threaten to live . 
  the church ... haha.church has billion of euros , doesnt pay taxes and doesnt give a damn.priests give some help but its nothing for them.its like giving the 0.00000000000000000000001 % of their fortune while they are earning much more everyday . 
  noone said that we are not rensposible ... but we didnt choose to take a huge loan that was actually ment to [ save european banks ] ( https://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/thomas-fazi/troika-saved-banks-and-creditors-%e2%80%93-not-greece ) . 
  believe me ... for this situation i am old enough to feel hopeless . 
  [ more children in greece are going hungry ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/world/europe/more-children-in-greece-start-to-go-hungry.html?_r=0 ), 
  where do u live ?? 
  ? everyday u hear that austerity doesnt work.only nowadays until the greek goverment take the deal you hear that `` austerity is the salvation '' and after this they will start again to say that [ austerity isnt working ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/02/26/the-reason-austerity-in-greece-didnt-work/ ), 
  how people feel in greece ... that is another question.many of them take the whole thing politicaly and say `` i hope we will die because we have left goverment '' ( yes ... there are many people that think like this ) . 
  from the one side we have the people that can barely live and they dont mind if they lose a bit more and from the other side we have the people that can not stand it anymore ( unemployers , low pensioners , homeless , people that are working with an undeclare job 12 hours per day to take 250 euros ) . 
  the polarization between greeks is huge.i clearly remember the [ 25th of may at 2011 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p5yr9xylcc ) when we , hundreds of thousands ( some say millions ) , started altogether , at every city , without political banners to demonstrate against austerity for 1 whole month.we didnt accomplish anything.in my opinion , that was the time we started to feel dissapointed . 
  i dont know what will happen.personally i am just a 19 years old boy that wants to finish the university.my future is black and i didnt even choose it.probably , i will follow the example of many young people and i ll leave greece when i finish.i hope that i will be able . 
  well ... this post is full of mistakes . 
  i am handling it by doing sex ( yes ... 3.5 euros for condoms everyday is too much but anyway ) , i am eating cherries , studing for my university exams and drinking beers . 
  how can i handle it my friend ... i close the tv because everyone is speaking against the goverment and deny to tell me how i can trust imf after so many mistakes.i am flaming redditors because they say that `` austerity is what greece needs '' and i am actually hopping that everything will finish soon . 
  i dont mind if we leave ez.really ... i dont.if they keep taking austerity measures i really dont.if i am going to die just to pay them back , i ` ld rather kill my self now.that is what i am hoping for.an announcement from imf that will say `` we want to eliminate your country and make you our sluts because you lied to us '' so i can rest in piece . 
   austerity is right what greece needs . 
  oh my god ... [ here is the impact of austerity ] ( http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-greek-economic-crisis-the-social-impacts-of-austerity-debunking-the-myths/5431010 ) and that is what we need eh ?? 
  [ i want back these money then ... ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/05/imf-underestimated-damage-austerity-would-do-to-greece ), 
  imf 's position is secured and is waiting for you . 
  first of all you said you live in romania ?? 
  ? ok ... thats why you are richer than greece : 1 ) [ taxation is way higher in greece than romania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tax_rates_of_europe ) 2 ) [ unempolyment in greece is 3,5 times higher than romania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_in_europe_by_unemployment_rate ) 3 ) gpd for greece is reducing while romania 's is increasing ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:gdp_per_capita_at_current_market_prices,_2003_and_2013_ ( % c2 % b9 ) _ ( eu-28 _ % 3d_100 ; _ based_on_pps_per_inhabitant ) _ yb15.png ) 4 ) [ the cost of living is way lower in romania than in greece ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=greece&amp;country2=romania ) 5 ) 1 million people in greece have 1 undeclared job 6 ) ** fuck ** everyone who wishes something bad for another country . 
  so you think imf act alone ?? 
  ? i dont think so.moreover i didnt say anything about drachma ... but how can u negotiate a better agreement when 10.000 people demonstrate with new democracy ( yes sir !!! ), 
  party ?? 
  ? its like supporting the imf . 
  i am happy you are not merging the meaning of the `` reform '' with pensions ' cut ... appreciated ... 
  one more ~ ~ idiot ~ ~ good economist ... congratulations.with these idiotic and simplistic thoughts maybe imf will hire you for 15.000 per month . 
   and until these guys and yes ... for me 50 is old ... 
  in greece journalists say that the payment in advance will be 3bn and not 2 . 
  well ... cant wait until these oldmen see that their pensions will be cut even more and until these guys see that unemployment will raise.they will start again : `` imf is death '' , `` tsipras fuck you , you should say no '' , `` europe just offers death '' , `` fuck austerity '' etc. . . 
  adonis is the biggest idiot in greece ... buy anyway :d, 
  dijssebloem : `` at the agreement of february we agreed at 2 flexibilites.the one was that the institutions should take into account the currect economical situation in greece '' . 
  you totally do ... 
  [ she already is ] ( http://huggykissypirates.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/angela-merkel.jpg ) dont open the link if you have health problems.they might get worse . 
  the problem wont be only european and i am pretty sure that in europe they know very well that the casualties from a grexit can not be calculated.the gpd loss ( even if it 's small ) , the market 's reaction , the imports-exports that will be lost , the decrease of the world 's trade rate because lets not forget that greece is the second largest shipowner , the geopolitical issue is important too ... these are only a few casualties that noone can calculate their cost and thats why there are huge differences between the theories about the grexit cost . 
   why should the ez care about this reform ? 
  the institutions have own demands . 
  because if they dont , they will lose way more . 
  you know what i mean ... 
  i am pretty sure that this proposal was the plan from the very beginning . 
  lets see ... 
  i ve been to istambul ( constantinople for us ) twice because my mom wanted to see her grand-grand mother 's home in kallipoli ( i cant remember the turkish name ) . beautiful city indeed . 
  the real problem is that the beautiful places are the mainstreat places.if you go further inside you will see the real poverty and that is what the turks must demand.a slow reconstruction everywhere and not only at the places that tourists go.this is my opinion of course and i dont know if they can do it because the city is huge ... 
  [ everyday 400 immigrants join greece illegaly ] ( http://www.iefimerida.gr/news/201288/kymata-metanaston-katafthanoyn-apo-ta-nisia-stin-omonoia-kathe-mera-400-atoma-mpainoyn ) . 
  turkey and greece must act together but we cant do it for the simple things.i doubt we will do it for this problem . 
  we already know that ... we are all focusing at the past.we must stop this bullshit.we know that we sucked really hard all these years.the problem is that we really believe that we suffered enough for our sins . 
  well ... the site sucks a bit but many greek sites replicate the message, 
  money ?? 
  ? what is this ??
