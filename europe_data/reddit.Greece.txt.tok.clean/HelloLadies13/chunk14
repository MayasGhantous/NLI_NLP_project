  [ who is useless ] ( http://www.thepressproject.net/article/65958/the-dramatic-reduction-in-the-greek-public-sector-277095-positions-axed-in-three-years ) ??? 
  moreover , i am not sure if greece decided who will be fired . 
  i heard that when he goes to wc he doesnt press the toilet tank.can i sell this info to the journalists ? 
  you obviously dont have any idea for what it is going on in greece ... 
  try to read [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_government-debt_crisis_countermeasures ) and compare it with the others.maybe when i return home i ll find something better for you . 
  lets be realistic my friend ... the measures that greece was forced to take was way harder than any other country . 
  thx you.i do it every now and then with my gf.maybe the problem is that you dont . 
  you are the ignorant who doesnt know that these things are connected in the economy . 
  [ * was in public sector ] ( http://www.thepressproject.net/article/65958/the-dramatic-reduction-in-the-greek-public-sector-277095-positions-axed-in-three-years ) now we have lack of doctors , profesors and taxmen . 
  greece has more potential than fyrom , bulgaria , albania obviously but u can not product without budget and with this high taxation.moreover lets not forget tourism that these countries dont have.the comparison between these countries can not happen . 
  the real problem about the productivity was that farmers ( for example ) used all the money that goverment gave to them to buy porces , bmw and bugatis instead of develop their equipment.that happend at all sections of productivity . 
  you have some serious problems with everything that is related to greece.obsessions require psychologists . 
  so what is the solution you suggest ? 
  so , having no taxmen solves the problem ?? 
  ? i agree that taxmen are currupted but we could deal with it with law measures . 
  well , our [ public sector is small enough ] ( http://www.thepressproject.net/article/65958/the-dramatic-reduction-in-the-greek-public-sector-277095-positions-axed-in-three-years ) . we dont even have enough doctors , professors and taxmen.i dont know which section is overpopulated.moreover if you cut more from the public sector then you immidiatly destroy what is left from the private sector because noone will buy . 
   that s what i am saying.tsipras and the rest want to raise taxes.i want a smaller public sector that will require lower taxes to sustain . 
  noone want to raise taxes.even the previous goverments ( \u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03c9\u03c1\u03b1 ... ) . but if they force you to do it you dont have a chance . 
  and we will resurrect the productivity by cutting funds ?? 
  ? how will we produce without money ?? 
  ? you know ... having space for production doesnt mean that you can product.you need money to develop and to start producing.this is basic economics . 
  honestly , even if you had 50 acres and 20.000 euros to start developing your equipment/or whatever would you start producing ?? 
  ? i wouldnt.vat + taxes would kill me . 
   and yet , no reports anywhere on this apparently pressing issue in the past three years , and not a topic in the negotiations , either . 
  lets pretend that the number stills the same.it 's pretty small.for example hungary with 1 million less population has 22.000 . 
   and yet , no reports anywhere on this apparently pressing issue in the past three years , and not a topic in the negotiations , either . 
  i agree . 
  since 2012 there is much more firing so i am pretty sure that its much more than 50 % or 50 % . 
  moreover , how they will help ?? 
  ? they dont want hiring and moreover most taxmen make more money working at private sector . 
  moreover , creditors were speaking about 100 tax inspectors.it will be helpful but not even enough . 
   that 's not `` you fired '' you think that the greek goverments were choosing who will be fired ?? 
  ? even if we choose we are aready having a big lack of doctors and profesors.we should cut more of them for taxmen ?? 
  ? everything is equal . 
  pm me your adress ... i will send you some ouzo for trying to fix the kiddy logic `` you dont have money , so you have to produce '' . 
  we need money to produce . 
  you cant find link with english language ... the only thing i found in english was this by varoufakis :  we do n't even have tax officers . 
  the salaries for the tax officers were reduced a lot , so a lot of them went into private practice . 
  the first day i was in office i asked : how many tax inspectors do i have access to ? 
  you know what the answer was ? 
  100 for the whole of greece . 
  moreover , [ in this greek article ] ( http://www.taxheaven.gr/news/news/view/id/10280 ) from ** 2012 ** you can read that back to 2012 ( now the number will be even smaller ) taxmen that were working were only 9.826 while back to 2009 16.000 . i dont want to know how many work today . 
   reforming the public sector with emphasis ** on fighting corruption . 
  ** how can we fight corruption when you fired over 50 % of taxmen ?? 
   not the creditors the grexit wont affect europe ( at a geopolitical and economical view ) ?? 
  ? maybe you wont be at the edge of the abyss but greece is not the only problem that europe has to deal with . 
  and the north europeans will be satisfied reading at bild that `` we won !!, 
  ! the [ lazy greeks ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/05/16/greeks-work-harder-than-germans-who-knew/ ) will keep paying !!, 
  ! fuck them !!! '', 
  depends on what you mean `` kids '' . i am 19 and i think that the situation with muslims is pretty much and our fault.we took advantage of their sources and left them poor.on the same time we ( i mean west ) made war with them ( irak for example ) for litteraly nothing.they act pretty bad but i dont really blame them.they are poor , uneducated people and they have the right to pass the buck back to us . 
  i dont have opinion about arabs , they were fostered with their religion and they learnt to be hardcores.thats the only thing i know . 
  btw i am unbeliever . 
  greece agreed to 90 % of european program ... what more can we do ?? 
  our gdp is lower than yours ( https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp ) _ per_capita ) and more over that its not the only factor that seperate rich from poor.for example , as i said the [ cost of living in your country ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/the-cost-of-living-worldwide-2015-1 ) is way lower than greece and [ your taxes too ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_tax_rates ) i now that you suffered and i admire you for what you 've accomplished . 
   that 's because most people here understand that only hard work , not borrowed money , can make one wealthy . 
  we didnt choose to take loans.northen europe + usa forced us just to save their banks ( even redditors dont deny it ) . you should make some searching before start to blame a whole nation.we know its our false but since 2008 we made huge sacrificies that are opposite to the [ human rights ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/10/eurozone-greece-pensions-idusl5n0yw4ad20150610 ) and imf+e urope is taking a wrong way as they already [ admitted ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/05/imf-underestimated-damage-austerity-would-do-to-greece )  plus we also have quite well structured economy , but there 's room for improvement of course . 
  so why are u crying for being poor?you are not.you havent seen how is to be poor so stop being mad.i used to live in this [ city ] ( http://www.world-of-waterfalls.com/europe-edessa-waterfalls.html ) . i ve seen people killing them selves at the waterfall because of poverty.people that i used to know . 
   it 's not your english that sucks , rather your knowledge about how the economy and the financial system funny thing because probably i have better view of how economy works because i study economics.probably i can not express my self very well or maybe i am ignorant because i am at the first year anyway  . 
  production and money are connected.greece used to have 1 really strong agriculture production ( for example ) once.the problem was that farmers were using their money to buy porche and bugatis :d rather than develop their equipment.that happend at every section of production . 
  so now after so many years i dont produce enough but in the same time i dont have the money to produce.thats why i am poor.because i dont have money and so i dont have production.even if someone has money believe me he wont start producing anything because of the high vat + other taxes that increase the possibility of money loss.thats why we are fucking `` screaming '' moreover i never claimed that i want to live like a german or borrow money.first of all , i love hanging out until the morning spending my money on whiskeys.i dont understand why u are so mad.i didnt want to borrow money from the very begging.i had aa idiot prime minister and some stupid european faggots that forced me . 
  who believes it ?????? 
  yes !!, 
  ! thx god someone revealed my true will !!!, 
   unwillingness to cut on the state 's expenses holy shit ... so the past 5 years greece didnt cut anything ... good job tortulho.keep it up . 
  / r/facepalm, 
  * if you gaze long enough into an abyss , the abyss will gaze back into you . 
  you mean that a lot of people will die because greece imports 70 % of needed products.greece can solve problems if there are reforms that actually help the economy ( we dont even have taxmen right now ) and a restructuring of the dept.otherwise grexit or europe is the same.people will die . 
  poorer ?? 
  ? lol ... who told you that ?? 
  ? you fucking have 6 % unemployment rate while we have 28 % ... the living cost is way smaller in your country too.wtf are u talking about?i wish i could live in your country . 
  well , noone can live with 432 euros in greece ... so if poverty line is determined by what people spend and not by what they need we are even in worse situation . 
  however i am not sure if i understood if it is.my english suck a bit ... , 
   determining the poverty line is usually done by finding the total cost of all the essential resources that an ** average ** human adult consumes in one year . 
  [ 6 ] the largest of these expenses is typically the rent required to live in an apartment , so historically , economists have paid particular attention to the real estate market and housing prices as a strong poverty line affector . 
  individual factors are often used to account for various circumstances , such as whether one is a parent , elderly , a child , married , etc. 
  the poverty threshold may be adjusted annually . 
  i think average is the word you need , 
   it 's that simple . 
  you must be top economist ... [ over half of all households in poverty or at risk thereof ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_25/09/2014_543220 ), 
  really ?? 
  ? you destroyed my dream.i thought i was the grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand ** son ** of periclis, 
   they are still way to high when compared to the actual value of the greek economy . 
  wtf ... you dont have any clue about economy right?wages doesnt matter ... the cost of living matters . 
   well , the rules of the imf say that they must not lend money to countries that will probably not be repayed . 
  actually , thats what i am talking about.we reached a point where if imf keep having this attitude they wont take their money back.it doesnt matter how much surplus you have if you take depressed measures every 6 month.at the end you will have 50 % unemployment and 3 % surplus.you will litteraly destroy the economy ( it is already destroed ) to take one part of the money back until the country say byebye.the greek dept will be completely get back to you in decades ( maybe more ) . this will keep on going for years . 
  maybe you are right even i dont understand what u mean `` rule '' but with your logic if imf is resposible for 3-4 bankrupts then all is ok because it sticked to it 's `` rules '' . 
  omg ... where do u find all this stuff ? 
  ? i didnt know that we have such an equipment . 
  imf doesnt want to compromise because then they must apologise if greek economy grow way more than before.imagine 180 countries to ask them why they prefered hardball austerity instead of something `` lighter '' even when they said that `` we miscalculated the problems that austerity can do to greek economy '' . 
  on the other hand if we got a grexit imf must apologise to 180 countries for the loss of so many billion dollars . 
  this is pretty hard for them too . 
  the same us who `` screams '' every now and then `` end with this story '' ?? 
  ? yeah ... they totaly want this to end . 
  / r/not, 
  fuck it ... if you want to know what `` people think '' i am not the one who gets downvoted at every post i do about greece . 
  no more talking here.you cant even understand what i am saying.i am not saying that all is europe 's fault.it 's greece falso too.the bild etc harmed your mind so fucking hard that your brain is just typing `` it 's greece 's fault '' when you touch the keyboard . 
  bild is harmful my friend.i cant believe u are so ignorant . 
  a ) tsipras rehired 20 cleaners that had been fired illegaly according to the constitutional b ) he is refusing further austerity measures because country can not stand them and that was not my point but obviously you cant read . 
  c ) they are trying to roll back all the measures that made 10.000 people kill them selves and over 300.000 to leave the country but by replacing them with same cost measures but you want too much more . 
  d ) keep it up ... u are an idiot .
