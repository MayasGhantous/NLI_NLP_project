  i agree but i dont think that euro would be a possible concept if some of the members didnt do it.the requirements were pretty high.germany could join and who else ? 
  thats the problem.when you have such a wide difference between the economies of every country ecb doesnt know what to do.all the countries need different measures but ecb can only implement one.for example , germany probably need revaluation and greece devaluation . 
  imo , eurozone can not work even with 2 powerful countries because there will always be differences . 
  its nearly impossible to look up the numbers.every 2 months we hear about new cuts so even if we find something from 2015 it will be completely irrelevant now . 
  / u/syuk according to dominique strauss-kahn many countries did what greece did.the thing is that greek economy could not handle it.i doubt anyone could predict that .

  you mean in the future?debt relief in eurozone only . 
  right now?time ... unsustainable debt means that at one point greece wont be able to repay an installment at someone and will go bankrupt.i dont know if this will happen in 6 months or 1-2 years.probably soon according to the reaction of imf . 
  if we dont go bankrupt the first time we will become the second one.the devaluation will be so massive ... i cant even imagine how much.you will be able to buy me ( lucky man ) for 1 euro or something.you have to understand that we are talking about a completely shit currency that needs to repay a debt at one of the strongest currencies.hail devaluation . 
  if greece leaves the eurozone debt cut wont matter because greece wont be able to repay a single installment without going bankrupt . 
  i was expecting this from us but we have only one scumbag of the old government that he is already accused for many things so no big surprises until now . 
  you dont understand ... this will hurt europe massively too.eventually greece will really go bankrupt because the debt is unsustainable.do you know how many billions besides the 300bn debt has europe invested at greece all these years ? 
  you were crying for loaning greece the past few years.imagine if they tell you that you will never take this money back because if greece go bankrupt that is what will happen.you can not expect greece to repay a debt in euros with drachmas because we would go bankrupt everyday . 
  the question to europe is : do you want a part of your money back or do you want to lose them all + the damage that will happen from the grexit ? 
  [ here ] ( https://wikileaks.org/imf-internal-20160319/transcript/imf%20anticipates%20greek%20disaster.pdf ) is the conversation . 
  people here are way misinformed.greece doesnt care about the macedonia name but about the fact that they are trying ( via propaganda ) to steal history as they do with other nations ( albania , bulgaria ) . 
  quote from / r/askhistorians  alexander the great was both a greek and a macedonian . 
  he considered himself greek , spoke greek , was in love with greek culture , and spread it across the world . 
  he simultaneously considered himself macedonian , however . 
  he was most definitely not slavic . 
   macedonians were a people living to the immediate north of classical greece in the area now mostly contained in the modern area known as greek macedonia ( of which the capitol is thessaloniki ) . 
  ancient macedonians spoke a northern variety of greek , as well as koine greek once it spread across the world . 
  the modern nation of slavic macedonia contains very little of ancient macedonia 's territory , and actually mostly coincides with an ancient nation called paeonia . 
   slavs did n't actually appear in the balkans until almost a thousand years after alexander 's death . 
  there 's currently a huge political dispute about the naming of the former yugoslav republic of macedonia . 
  i 'm not completely clear on why the nation chooses to call itself macedonia , but i believe it goes back a few hundred years at least . 
  it certainly creates a lot of confusion , not to mention bad blood with the greeks in greek macedonia . 
  macedonian empire was created by the house of argeads that was greek.alexander himself took part in olympics that at the time were only for greeks.sure , hirodotos calls them barbarians but that has nothing to do with origins but with the way of life . 
  `` we deal with this all the time '' and you post 2 threads from the same guy ... yes ... no.seriously ... in greece barely everyone thinks about it until something happens.then it is in the news for 5 mins and ends there . 
  dude ... do you have any source that journalists were `` attracting people into dangerous river '' and they didnt just follow them ? 
  ps.this guy has 31 upvotes ? 
  / r/europe at its finest ... 
   it is a useful tool to inspire us how to live , what to aspire and our morals . 
  i dont know how the church is in netherlands but in greece the church is only capable to inspire the believers to kill gay people and muslims . 
   in my opinion neither man or woman behaves like a proper person anymore . 
  that accept everything and everyone has gotten out of control . 
  define `` proper person ''  we need something to guide us . 
  it should now be economic , because i believe that is the direction what we are heading in now , but it should be spiritual . 
  science is the word you are looking for . 
  dude , i dont understand what is your point.if you dont see that many kids are getting used in the religious way of life that probably wouldnt if they werent forced then you are living in another planet.enough with this retarded conversation ...  i was baptised does n't affect my life at all . 
  if i were still a believing catholic , i 'd have no problem with it . 
  if i decided to convert to another faith , i could also do it without problems . 
  not everyone is like you ... i know many guys that are fanatics about religion and if you look back at their life they were from young age near church , priests and religious schools.if you are like that from the age of 5 then you dont have clear mind in the future to decide properly . 
  fucking simple logic . 
  so being forced to be a part of a religion that you dont know wtf is it its not against the human rights . 
  * if you dont see how it is against the human rights i am not sure how i can help you * ... 
  i am not saying what is worse from circumcision ... i am saying that both are against the human rights.kids should not be part of any kind of religion until they grow up and decide on their own.in fact , every kid should not be allowed to even enter the church until he become adult.thats how the world should be ... forcing a kid to be part of a religion that he doesnt understand is a criminal act . 
  so your point is that its fine to trespass human rights if there is no physical impact?yeah ... thats not hypocrite at all ... / s by the way circumcision is not as brutal as you think and has many cons.it can be easily justified as anticipation for the prostate 's cancer for example . 
  heraklion is the ugliest place in crete . 
  yep ... only the russian alphabet is a bit similar ... but only the alphabet . 
  i agree that people should do circumcision when they are adults but believe me its not brutal . 
   imo europe is too left not at all ... as for circumcision , i had mine when i turned 16 for medical reasons and i agree that its not brutal ( its a bit painful at the first 1-2 nights ) . i dont agree with you about the age tho.children dont know shit when they are 9 . same logic applies to christian baptism.people should decide when they are adults . 
  agreed ... the same logic applies to christian baptism . 
  edit : if the people that downvote me agree that circumcision before the age of 18 is against the human rights but being baptised before the age of 18 is not then they are fucking hypocrites . 
   your potential household income is more that 200k/year what?thats not accurate . 
  [ the sky is not blue ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nafbgoqblqs ), 
  because [ imf fucked up ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/05/imf-admit-mistakes-greek-crisis-austerity ) and because [ the debt is unsustainable and merkel knew it from the beginning ] ( http://www.vox.com/2015/7/2/8883307/merkel-nsa-wikileaks-greek-crisis ) . 
  comparing greece with cyprus or countries in general is like trying to compare apples with bananas . 
  i wonder how long will it take to burn the island or where they will all find place to sleep ... thats not a solution.lesbos has civilians and can not accommodate that number of refugees . 
  the thing is that there are international laws that predict the lack of passport because leaving from a war zone obviously doesnt guarantee that you will have it.you can not deny the entry until you find out that they dont have the right to stay.good luck with that ... most of them are not even willing to talk . 
  right ... come here in greece : play call of duty by shooting as many refugees you want , pay the fine and then we will let netherlands deal with the consequences.after all `` everyone ignores the international laws '' . deal ? 
  seriously , i prefer to die fucking poor instead of shooting anyone.i like the fact that you are flaming isis but you want to become like them.good job world ... 
  you are completely retard and your ignorance towards international laws is mindblowing.the second that we will shoot a bullet at refugees ' boat ( even 50 m away ) we will be massively fined , we will get kicked out of nato and eu , and we will get completely isolated by the rest of the world including your own country . 
  moreover , for fucks sake have some respect for refugees.i understand that its nice to sit on your couch and write `` shoot them '' in reddit but think a bit before you do it . 
  feels good to live on an island thousands miles away ...  greece is just as guilty too , it 's not even tried to keep immigrants there , or register them and keeps insisting on the quota idea . 
  yeah ... tell me know that your country wouldnt do the same.tell me something , how can you register someone that literally doesnt talk?many of them if they are not syrians the only thing that they say is `` germany '' . you cant do anything about them ... keeping the immigrants there?dude ... your country messed up the whole universe for 10.000 refugees !!, 
  ! lmao ... how can you expect from someone else to do exactly the opposite ? 
  tell us about that policy you have in mind sir ... i am curious . 
  this is the most idiotic and ignorant comment i ve ever read . 
  i mean ... there are literally hundreds of articles that answer to your questions and demolish your arguments.one simple google search or even a search in this subreddit and you will see why you are so fool . 
  how can you be so mentally retarded?i mean ... how can you even exist with this completely nonfunctional brain?how old are you?if you are 10-15 i might regain hopes for you ... 
  adopt me / s, 
  fast water ... that is the solution ... fast water.i dont know if you are 10 or something but the migrant crisis wont stop because of `` fast water '' . 
  water will solve the problem ... i am sure.you are a genius !!, 
  and what can we do ... ?? 
  ? enlighten us your majesty !!, 
  this is the account that you use when you know you will be downvoted for the bullshits that you say ? 
  yeah ... this is not how things work . 
  i dont understand what you are trying to say . 
  the word `` naive '' said the guy who sits on his couch , browsing reddit and drinking cola.dont get me wrong ... i know europe can not take all the poor people of the world but saying the other people naives because they know what is going on on migrants ' countries is stupid . 
  its completely natural for these people to want to come to europe.if you werent so lucky to be born here in europe you ` ld might do the same right now . 
  european banks went into the red because of many reasons and not only greece ... lmao.the crisis didnt start from greece and greece was not the only crisis with debt that couldnt be paid.spain had loans of 1,100 bn , ireland 800 bn , portugal 320bn and greece 300bn . these countries had problems ... 
  moreover according to [ nsa ] ( http://www.vox.com/2015/7/2/8883307/merkel-nsa-wikileaks-greek-crisis ) and [ wsj ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/sb10001424052702304441404579119180237594344 ) ( [ here ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/154409/article/ekathimerini/business/secret-imf-documents-reveal-extent-of-concern-about-2010-greek-bailout ) without the paywall ) everyone knew back then that the greek debt is unsustainable . 
  everyone seems to forget really fast ... 
  gdp means everything ... we lost gdp because of austerity and because we had to pay our debt ( something which we wouldnt be able to do if we had defaulted for obvious reasons ) . the deficit was because of what we were paying . 
  in 2010 we had 25 % more gdp ... there is a huge difference ... 
   i am sorry but you are an idiot . 
  no , you are an idiot that think that 11.000.000 +1 -2.000.000 that live and work in europe will choose to voluntarily become a 4th world country ( yeah new definition ) instead of hoping for something better.this is the most delusional proposal i ve seen : `` hey guys , i was born in difficult times , we were eating the shits of horses ... you can do the same voluntarily.you wont be able to buy drugs tho or gas to go to the hospital , food will be limited , you will get paid peanuts instead of money but it doesnt matter bro ... vote for it.take the peanuts !!! '' . 
  sorry bro ... noone wants to default in a country that already lost 25 % of its gdp in 4 years and has 27 % unemployment . 
  what industry do i have?i produce only the ** 30 % ** of what i consume.how will i buy gas , drugs etc with a trash currency ?? 
  ? there is no way to import anything for the first 1 + year.argentina was producing ** 70 % ** of what people were consuming and watch some documentaries to see what happened.they literally were hunting cows to survive . 
  the referendum was not talking about bankruptcy and exit from ez.tsipras had promised that we will stay in eu/ez .
