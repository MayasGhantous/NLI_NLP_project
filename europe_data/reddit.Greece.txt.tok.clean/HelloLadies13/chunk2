  actually most balkan countries dont like them.in 1993 serbian government invited greece to invade them but we refused . 
  what ? 
   it is interesting that this is becoming important again in greece it doesnt ... 
  they cant but even if they could i doubt it.they say that they * claim * it historically ... this is not a reason to invade somewhere . 
  the best comment that i found : * from the historical point of view , there is no doubt that ancient macedonians are part of greek nation . 
  * * going to the present . 
  * * the so-called macedonians from fyrom , are part of the southern-slavic family . 
  slavs emigrate to balkans at 600-700 ac ( almost a millenium after alexander the great ) . greeks have been there for thousands of years.even if you suposse that ancient macedonians were n't greeks , its really hilarious to claim monopolising this name , since its more likely to be for them to have been mixed , not only with `` macedonians '' , but with greeks and other nations as well , let along that macedonians ( ancient ) were not that picky , to wait for the slavic migration to be mixed . 
  * * this region of greece , has been always called macedonia . 
  * * now , you can see a country created just some years ago , trying to name itself macedonia as well!not only they have no connection from the historical point of view , they also have no connection in the ancient land 's point of view , but yet , they are claiming even greek borders !!, 
   except that macedonia is the name of the region the country known as fyrom is located who says these bullshits ?? 
  ? macedonia was a huge empire with the capital in northern greece ... with the same logic the whole middle east can be renamed to `` macedonia '' because they were conquered . 
  * refuges * refuges * refuges * refuges * refuges * refuges * noone care about the elections, 
  nop ... the government 's channel showed the mkd at the iaaf wc before a couple of days and noone said anything . 
  well , ofc its for the self-employed people but that doesnt make it less devastating for the economy . 
   other eurozone member-states even offered the help of their own tax authorities to help greece setup a working system , an offer which all greek governments since the first bailout request refuse to even talk about it ever again . 
  sauce that we refuse plz . 
  have you ever heard the phrase `` uniteral action '' from europe ? 
  the next year 's taxes for now and on , will be prepaid by 100 % ( this `` reform '' is from this memorandum ) . 
  i actually wanted to say that all these taxes ( some of them are unfair ) cant be repaid by the biggest majority of greeks.i mean 100 % prepaid tax ?? 
  ? who can do that ?? 
  ? noone understand it yet but we will talk about grexit very soon . 
   i hope the futur finance minister will know what he 's doing believe me ... right now in greece you can be finance minister too.everything is scheduled.you cant do anything else ... only what the memorandum says . 
   the next year 's taxes are prepaid , by 50 % . 
  now it will be 100 % i think . 
   especially with tsipras wanting to simply make the taxes double , instead of one and half . 
  this is not about greece ... all these stuff started with the memorandums.our system was not like that . 
  its not about `` greece '' ... its about the channel . 
  everyone wants to play for their national team.only nbaers cause troubles.last year koufos from sacramento kings didnt come because he was too tired.everyone was flaming him so he came this year :d . but this year everything is fine ... we ve got 4 nba players and all are here . 
  root for yanis antentokounmpo !!, 
  ! root for greece ... [ loser ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_d1wjzv50lo ) !!!, 
  teo is a great player ... i dont doubt it ... but he is a bid asshole sometimes just like rudy :p . i am not jealous dude ... i have 4 nba players in my team and i ve seen many distinctions the last years . 
  oh god ... teodosic ... the most hateful player after rudy.i remember when he was playing for olympiakos he used to [ hit everyone ] ( https://youtu.be/awawfep6ucq?t=88 ) to avoid 3shots . 
  greece vs croatia today ( 9/6 ) ... get ready boys ... we are coming :d, 
  the author lives in a utopia.where can i find tickets ?? 
  greece/italy/spain if you have money for a whole life.germany , switzerland and uk if you are looking for a job and a nice place to live and sweden , norway , finland if you want to suicide ^ ^ / s. 
   it really depends . 
  it made trade between countries easier , reduced/eliminated tariffs and in general , united the trade of countries that use the euro . 
  well ... you dont need the euro or the eu to do all these ... 
   the greeks wo n't budge despite all they ~ ~ had to go ~ ~ are going through . 
  ftfy, 
  for greece yes , for germany no and for the others ... we dont know yet.you cant judge the currency because of 1-2 crisis . 
  you should impose capital controls then / s no kidding ... every shop has one of these card machines because of capital controls.even the taxis ... 
  yeah thats true :p, 
  hail capital cotrols !!!, 
   the regions governed by golden dawn ???? 
   and saying `` they are literally nazis '' is not a real argument . 
  wtf ? 
  `` vote golden dawn '' , `` kill them '' , `` the army must step in '' , `` this is syriza 's fault '' ( well this is a bit funny ) etc. . . 
  i was talking about youtube comments . 
  one question ... if these people were germans and the title was `` germans riot '' your reaction would be similar ? 
  the scariest thing is not the video but the comments.holy shit ... we ve got 2 weeks until the election this is the worst timing . 
  5.000 guns and 500.000 bullets.imagine the number of guns that is arriving there everyday . 
  greece was paying 1 million/day for operations in iran.the first example that came to my mind . 
  fucking brilliant!hahaha, 
  actually west ( in general ) has done many bad things and the result is this.i dont know if its all our fault but we are the ones to blame for sure . 
  you dont want to know what you have to read to succeed in panhellenic exams ... the problem is that the syllabus is insane . 
  you dont even understand what education ranking means ... right ?? 
  cost of living in greece is bigger than in spain ?? 
  ? shit ... i didnt know that . 
  i didnt say that ... the only thing i know its that you must be naive to believe that your political system is as clean as it seems.there is corruption everywhere but you just cant see it . 
  innocent swedish boy !!, 
  ! you are so cute ... come here ... i will give you a hug . 
   they 've done so little reform this is not true at all ... give me a source that someone says that . 
   even with debt cancellation they 'll be in eternal debt . 
  those clamoring about the surpluses . 
  with debt cancellation it puts down the nail to not to lend to greece , what is greece going to do then ... ask for more bailout to sustain a lifestyle above other eu members ? 
   i bet the poles would n't mind a few 100 billion at an extremely low rate over a long long period yeah ... because europe acts based on poles like they did before 1 month . ^ ^ sarcasm, 
  is ireland 's or portugal 's debt unsustainable or are they in the same condition as greece ( 27 % unemployment etc ) ? i understand that all these countries implemented austerity in a hard way and it seems that it succeed ( from what we hear at least ) but you have to choose if you want to speak with economical terms or morale terms . 
  if you choose the second you have to kick greece out of the eu right now . 
  no i dont say that ... i say exactly the opposite.i mean in game theory ( i do some in my university but ofc it is just a class of 1 hour/week i dont know anything in fact ) you must have a common target.in order to implement the theory both sides ( europe and greece ) should be searching for a way of growth and stability.the only way to do that is to do not implement austerity measures and give a debt cut which obviously couldnt happen.thats why game theory was not a solution.nowadays game theory is really hard to be implemented in politics because there are not common targets . 
  when you learn what game theory is you will understand that noone would be able to implement it . 
   the basic assumption of game theory is the '' intelligence '' and '' rational '' behavior of players . 
  think about it . 
   how many riots greece had against government borrowing money ? 
  too many, 
  ? romania gives money ?? 
  ? fresh , nice , smelly money ?? 
  ? how did we miss it ???!!!, 
  ps.thx god we did !, 
   dire straits now is because they failed/didn ' t care to collect any taxes at all , across all income brackets . 
  agreed ... the question is what europe does for it , right now ?? 
  ? i mean ... they give orders the last 5 years ... 
  well ... church doesnt touch some people that much . 
  i started to drink at pubs when i was 12-13 and the first time i got drunk was at the age of 14-15 . 
  i have to say that i used to live in a small city of 20.000-30 .000 citizens.if you live in a bigger city you will probably start to go to pubs a bit later . 
  these kind of graffities do not get covered usually ... there are tons of this kind in thessaloniki and athens . 
  my favorites from athens is [ this ] ( http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150702180918-greece-graffiti-image-8-next-1100x619.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150702180800-greece-graffiti-image-6-euros-1100x619.jpg ), 
   anti-austerity governments we dont have anti-austerity governments right now in europe.moreover i guess he has the money to do it on his own . 
  before the referendum greek medias were showing `` hoteliers '' that were complaining about 30 % -60 % drop at their bookings.well played . 
  you need a life.bye bye , 
  yeah ... sorry i should not mention economical issues even if i study economics ... really sorry . 
  i hate people that generalizes the shit out of them.i guess you are nazi because most grandfathers of germans were nazis.its fine now i guess ... fucking nazi . 
  edit : yeah delete your idiotic messages ... 
  where were you when there was this `` nato fuck them '' zerg here in reddit ?
