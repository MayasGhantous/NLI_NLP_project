  when ? 
   maharaja ranjit singh was the founder and ruler of the sikh empire based in the punjab region of india . 
  he willed the diamond to the hindu temple of jagannath in puri . 
  however , after his death in 1839 the british east india company did not execute his will.on 29 march 1849 , the british raised their flag on the citadel of lahore and the province of punjab was formally proclaimed part of the british company rule in india . 
  one of the terms of the treaty of lahore , the legal agreement formalising this occupation , was as follows :  the gem called the koh-i-noor which was surrenderd by shah shuja-ul-mulk to maharajah ranjit singh and then surrendered by the maharajah of lahore to the queen of england . 
  well ... you could call that a gift ... i guess . 
  hey guys , look !!, 
  ! britain stole something and doesnt give it back ... what a surprise !!!, 
  valve will pay the money for sure but even if valve wont , they will not have a problem . 
  yes you are right!greece should disavow a huge part of history because a country happened to live in a place that is literally a 0.2 % -10 % ( depends on the historic period ) of an empire.also greece should forget that their ancestors came at that place literally 1 millennium after the fall of macedonian empire . 
  with this logic greece could be renamed to rome and bulgaria to byzantium if they would like because people back then used to call these places with these names.it is about common human logic about right and wrong.every month you see provocations and the excuse `` dont act like that to a small country '' is just ridiculous because we are talking about whole parts of history and a whole nation that teaches false things to its citizens on purpose . 
  gyros doesnt do anything to us.unfortunately :(, 
  bulldog gangs helena 's ass ... i am jealous of him . 
  goodbye fellow neighbors : /, 
  a kebab is a piece of grilled meat , or shaped , grilled mince meat.gyros , shawarma and doner on the other hand are all wraps that contain some kind of ( mostly grilled ) meat . 
  the differences between them are mainly due to the kind of ingredients that are used , and how they are prepared . 
  did you find anything ? 
  tell me that you believe that after a grexit we will keep paying ... there is no way to pay with drachmas a debt in euros.greece would go bankrupt every weekend . 
  i am not saying that it isnt common sense ... but the number seems to be pretty huge . 
  is this legit or only bild report it fellow germans ? 
  dont forget the castle :( . seriously tho ... i ve travelled much and i dont know why ... i fell in love with the city.obviously i might change my mind if i stay there . 
  its the first time i hear this ... rofl . 
  [ whatever you say mate !!!, 
  what the hell we are then ? 
   when they will be seeking work thats the worst part ... they are not going to find a job for the next 2-3 years ** for sure ** . what will happen to the other 30.000 ?? 
  ? i am pro-refugees ( these that are coming from countries with war ofc ) but this is not going to work . 
  moreover , many people will react for the free food/rent . we are in a country with 50 % of the population below the line of poverty.things wont go well . 
  we all suck ... 
  salzburg ... from all the cities i ve visited this is the one that i fell in love with.maybe taormina is the next one for a strange reason . 
  for the cities i havent visited i would say seattle because of the quality of life . 
  50.000 more unemployed.poor guys ... they thought that they could have a better future.now they will cry their 5.000 $ -10.000 $ they wasted to come here . 
  they are because of [ this ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/01/enfia-tax-greece-new-symbol-austerity-2014130124545458507.html ) . in 2-3 year i hope we wont have this law ... the houses are really cheap because of that . 
  all my love affairs until now are with girls that in the beginning were `` friends '' of mine.yeah ... from my experience there is no friendzone.when i will break up with my gf i will come back to write about flirt with strangers . 
  as for friends ... it is very easy to show them what you feel.touch her hand , grab her and kiss her you pussy . 
  [ rofl ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/r-merkel-says-deal-with-greece-still-possible-if-athens-musters-will-2015-6 ), 
   you can drag their boat out to sea again they sink their boat on purpose and you have to save them because ... treaties and because we are not assholes . 
  before you start posting things like that read the treaties and what is happening . 
  i came here expecting to see someone say `` asshole '' . 
  i am disappointed . 
  white socks ***, 
  actually this is not what happening.science states things and religion question them because the statements are opposed to christian beliefs.do you want one example?theory of evolution ... for how many years christians were flaming darwin ?? 
  ? some of them even now ... do you want another ??? 
  ? big bang theory and many others . 
   our religion is stepping together with science . 
  just no . 
   ~ ~ submarine ~ ~ typical christian ftfy, 
  i am nonreligious ... i dont believe in any religion but i also hate the priests and their old-fashioned beliefs.we are one of the few countries in europe that doesnt have sexology in school because of the church and the result is that we are first at unwanted pregnancies.moreover , the church doesnt pay taxes but in addition we pay for them.even if you are not christian you must pay taxes for the church.holy moly ... 
  dude ... noone said that we didnt cook the books ... rofl.i am not saying that greece didnt do mistakes.in 2010 everyone knew about the cooked books.all started at 2008 . 
  memorandums were made because of the cooked books . 
  greek forecasts was wrong because [ this ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/05/imf-underestimated-damage-austerity-would-do-to-greece ), 
  ofc they were all technical ... according to the forecasts of 2010 we should also have growth at 2011 but we had -3.7 % recession.the growth that we had was a political trick.dont forget that europe is mostly about politics.if it was about economics we should already have a debt relief.for how long do you think greek economy will last with austerity measures every 6-12 months ? 
   a quick translation at the best part : according to an analysis that was leaked to reuters , the predictions about the potential of greek debt was wrong.of course everyone who thinks that this is because of the long-negotiations is naive.from last year ( 2014 ) , when the last analysis of sustainability establized , the mark was 7 % higher at 117,2 % instead of 110 % of gdp at 2022 even before the period of the high surpluses ( 4,5 % ) starts , combined with 3,5 % rate of growth . 
  according to imf , the worst scenario which is the dominant , at 2022 the debt will be at 142,2 % of gdp , 25 points higher than the last predictions.what means that ?? 
  ? that there will be a gap of 50bn . 
  [ sauce ] ( http://www.iefimerida.gr/news/214040/trito-paketo-me-50-dis-eyro-vlepei-dnt-mono-etsi-einai-viosimo-hreos ) even with this growth things were wrong.moreover , the growth was not real but actually `` technical '' . the old government delayed some austerity measures with the acceptance of eu after they lost the eu mp 's elections the spring of 2014 . after that eu and the old government agreed to also delay the negotiations that took part in february ( with syriza government ) and should have happened at the august of 2014 . so imagine if in august we had more austerity measures + the austerity measures that hadnt been implemented and i will repeat again with the acceptance of eu.growth wouldnt have happen and nd wouldnt have a chance to win the elections that eventually lost . 
  from the same site that you sent me : [ greece is clearest example that austerity does n't work ] ( http://www.marketwatch.com/story/greece-is-proof-austerity-doesnt-work-2015-07-14 ), 
  pfff ... plz look my other comment about this growth.you guys are so delusional . 
  * austerity is not abour borrowing less money ... oh my gosh.its about reducing the deficit and paying back the money you already borrowed . 
  * ok ... this is not an answer ... if greece refused the packages then we should return to drachma that is worst.if you speak for 2010 then when g.papandreou ( prime minister ) said that he wants to do a referendum the next day he was not prime minister ( if you remember what happened at cannes ) * how can a country be stable with a unsustainable debt ?? 
  ? do you know what means unsustainable debt ? 
  * yes ... the next time it will be eu 's turn.either accept the dept relief or lose the loaned money.because this is what will happen . 
  * austerity works until a certain point.moreover you dont use it to borrow less money . 
  * its not eu 's fault that we loaned so much but its eu 's fault that keeps pretending that everything is fine while they knew from 2011 ( according to nsa ) that the debt is unsustainable . 
  * companies dont give a damn about `` work on debt '' . are you living in a utopia?companies will not invest in a country which half of the population is below the line of poverty because they wont sell their products.moreover they will not invest in a country with an unsustainable debt and they will only seek for cheep offers mainly from privatizations like the 14 airports that will payback immediately . 
  what you mean `` work on debt '' . greece is not in charge for the last 5 years.we dont choose what we will do ... economy and imf 's forecasts were fucked up way before syriza . 
   what is happening now with greece and eu is not only punishment . 
  austerity works , especially on the long run . 
  if not ireland , spain and portugal should not see any growth now . 
  however they do now . 
  * spain etc situation is not similar with greece * greece has faced austerity in a more tough way * how can austerity work with a unsustainable debt ? 
  * greece had what every other country has within the eu.noone cares about the will but about profit.noone is going to invest in your country with an unsustainable debt ... only people who will get fast payback as it happens the last 5 years . 
  because of [ enfia ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/01/enfia-tax-greece-new-symbol-austerity-2014130124545458507.html ) + some other taxes noone buys houses and everything is cheeper.i mean you cant put 600 euros rent when your house costs 40.000 these days . 
   he poverty rate for pensioners ( 19 percent ) and salaried workers ( 17 percent ) [ source ] ( http://web.worldbank.org/wbsite/external/topics/extpoverty/extpa/0,,contentmdk:20205288~menupk:435735~pagepk:148956~pipk:216618~thesitepk:430367~iscurl:y~iscurl:y,00.html ), 
  so you just care about punishment.because this is not even working for eu . 
  also , about growth :  a quick translation at the best part :  according to an analysis that was leaked to reauters , the predictions about the potential of greek debt was wrong.of course everyone who thinks that this is because of the long-negotiations is naive.from last year ( 2014 ) , when the last analysis of sustainability establized , the mark was 7 % higher at 117,2 % instead of 110 % of gdp at 2022 even before the period of the high surpluses ( 4,5 % ) starts , combined with 3,5 % rate of growth .

  a small salary for 9 months and then nothing.if you are 40 + and unemployed u are screwed.you will probably never find a job again . 
  ? almost half a million left the country , the suicide rates are doubled after every memorandum , half of people live below the line of poverty ,27 % unemployment rate means that many people will not be able to find job again and we are not finished.moreover with these policies there is not light in the tunnel.the unemployment will keep rising and the debt is fucking unsustainable . 
  its so nice to judge from your couch i guess ... 
   the pension system in germany , ranked 12th in the world with a score of 55.3 , consists of an earnings-related state pension based on the number of `` pension points '' earned during an individual 's career , plus a means-tested safety net for low-income pensioners . 
  supplementary pension plans are common among major employers . 
   `` germany has an ageing population and a very generous state pension . 
  it is looking for ways to reduce the pension bill , '' said mr mclean . 
  [ sauce ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/pensions/9902745/the-best-pensions-in-the-world.html ) moreover , not only the benefits are really high in germany but also germans dont have to feed their adult unemployed children , nephews etc. . . 
  i know some old greek people that go to bulgaria ... i ve heard about a village at the borders that is like a greek community, 
  actually this website is the most reliable on that matter . 
  the think is that the budget will never be balanced with an unsustainable debt and a destroyed economy.they will never take their money back by borrowing more and destroying the economy even more.we will always reach a point that we will need more cuts to pay back.this can not go much further ... without a debt relief/reconstructing for how long can greek economy last ? 
  noone argues ... but this doesnt change my point . 
  yes ... thats true but with 23 % vat the cost of living can not come down.i dont know what the creditors were thinking with this vat . 
  i dont know how is the life in romania but i should add that 45 % of pensions are below the poverty line that is adjusted for greece.as i said ... taxes and the unemployment ( many pensioners feed their children etc ) is destroying the pensioners.you can read more [ here ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/16/eurozone-greece-pensions-idusl5n0z12ps20150616 ) . 
  its a bit weird situation.we spend too much on pensions but on the other hand if we dont all these people will die . 
  its 17,5 because the gdp fell really quickly.moreover there are many other facts ... [ read this ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/16/eurozone-greece-pensions-idusl5n0z12ps20150616 ), 
  [ here you are ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=greece&amp;country2=romania ) ... moreover you should add the 27 % unemployment + the bigger taxes . 
  ps.why the water is so expensive in romania ? 
  before this cut average pension in greece was 800 euros.i cant find the graphs on eurostat but i found this [ article ] ( http://news.sky.com/story/1504923/greek-pensions-q-and-a-too-generous ) that involves some of them ( but the stats are from 2012 ) . 
  europe statistics on what ? 
  [ source ] ( http://www.protothema.gr/economy/article/519214/-meiosi-eos-kai-33-stis-sudaxeis-ano-ton-1000/ ) * the reform will affect 930.000 pensioners, 
  i am at uom ... [ here ] ( http://www.uom.gr/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=statikes&amp;file=index&amp;stid=107&amp;categorymenu=1 ) you can find the universities but i am not sure if this list is renewed .
