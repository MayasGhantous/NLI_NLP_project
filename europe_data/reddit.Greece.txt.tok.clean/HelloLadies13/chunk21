  you should do this question at / r/greece btw ... 
  shhhhh ... truths are not allowed here . 
  i will send you some in ladokola if you promise me that u will bring back to greece the girl named arabella from manchester.god she was so hot ... too bad i was/am in relationship . 
  its not about * opinions * ... its about facts.uk has a great military , a great geopolitical spot and a huge economy . 
  he didnt say anything about france and germany.he said that if uk leaves eu , it will be a disaster which is true . 
  you must be , and i am trying to be very polite , * idiot * to believe that uk isnt an important country not only for eu but for the whole world . 
  not only with fifa.i dont wan na know how much we gave for the olympics back in 2004 . generally , all these tourns cause corruption.i dont believe that only greek politicians took/gave dirty money at the olympics . 
  wealth = houses having a house these days in greece is not wealth but a disaster because [ enfia ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/01/enfia-tax-greece-new-symbol-austerity-2014130124545458507.html ) my parents took a loan 15 years back and built a really big house.now they cry their money.noone buys houses these days because of these taxes even if the prices are ridiculously low .

  economics ... shit ... i will become a greek economist.noone will hire me :d, 
  well ... we will see it in 3 years when i will finish my uni and look for work abroad.i dont think its so simple to find a work . 
  monthly but its not good for a country like germany.the cost of living is high . 
   after 3 years when you get your ` degree ' in this apprenticeship you will get around 2000-2700 $ if i color my self ... will it work ?? 
  i know a lot ... its not the situation by itself but the anxiety , the fights , the feeling of struggle etc that are creating with the passage of time . 
   there is a blue canton in the upper hoist-side corner bearing a white cross ; the cross symbolises eastern orthodox christianity , the established religion of the greek people of greece and cyprus . 
  according to popular tradition , the nine stripes represent the nine syllables of the phrase '' \u0395\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03ae \u0398\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 '' ( `` freedom or death '' ) , the five blue stripes for the syllables '' \u0388\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 '' and the four white stripes '' \u03ae \u0398\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 '' . 
  the nine stripes are also said to represent the letters of the word `` freedom '' ( greek : \u0395\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 ) . 
  there is also a different theory , that the nine stripes symbolise the nine muses , the goddesses of art and civilisation ( nine has traditionally been one of the numbers of reference for the greeks ) . 
   the blazon of the flag is azure , four bars argent ; on a canton of the field a greek cross throughout of the second . 
  the shade of blue used in the flag has varied throughout its history , from light blue to dark blue , the latter being increasingly used since the late 1960s . 
   the above patterns were officially adopted by the first national assembly at epidaurus on 13 january 1822 . 
  blue and white have many interpretations , symbolising the colours of the famed greek sky and sea ( combined with the white clouds and waves ) , traditional colours of greek clothes in the islands and the mainland , etc. 
  the church in cyprus affects the christians too much.i know one doctor that does transplants and one day his mother disowned ( is this right ? ), 
  him because she heard at the church that transplant is a sin.the funny thing is that she has 2 more sons that are doctors.well ... this is only one example but it is true that cypriots are really close with the church.probably because of the conflict between north and south . 
  wow ... now i can understand why greek doctors are moving to germany ... habits can not be changed . 
  i havent seen/heard about indians in my country . 
  1 ) lots of people play and spend money on it . 
  2 ) they are increasing taxes on gaming purchases :d, 
  2015 is not over yet . 
  from 2008 until 2014 . the last 7-8 months we had growth but many people call it `` technical '' because the old government delayed austerity measures and the negotiations that we had in february-july in order to achieve it . 
  actually i want to take it this semester so i will be able to be `` ok '' the next one when is the real course.the topics are * introduction of econometrics * the example of a variable * the properties of evaluators and statistic induction ( ?? ), 
  * introduction at the classic linear example of regression * method of least squares * evaluator of least squares and its properties * coefficient of determination and 5-6 other things that i cant remember right now ... we can choose on textbook from the followings : [ introductory of econometrics-wooldridge ] ( https://books.google.gr/books?id=64vt5tdbnlwc&amp;redir_esc=y ) [ basic econometrics - gujarati d.n. 
  and porter d.c. ] ( https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/basic_econometrics.html?id=6l1cpgaacaaj ) and one book from a greek guy . 
  what an asshole ... turks deserve better . 
  i know but its just too early for the difficult classes ... i wanted something easy for 8 am :d, 
  second year ... i had maths at 8am last year : /, 
  university has started !!, 
  ! fuck my life !!, 
  ! i have econometrics ( is this right ? ), 
  every monday-tuesday at 8am ... rip my life . 
  the 32 millions is the emergency fund that gave us before 1 week ... i dont understand your point.the 260 mln is the standard payment and its not even enough to host 200.000 + refugees/build accomodations/feed them etc.anyway ... 
  yeah i know that ... thats because 50.000 refugees per year pass the greek borders but this year its different . 
  its not just a name ... its a claim of a whole history part of another nation without any logic/rights . 
   do they have territorial claims ? 
  well ... some of them claim that the whole macedonia should belong to them . 
   i mean the name thing i will never understand . 
  we could try to bully around france because their name over here is frankreich , meaning empire of the franken which are a german tribe . 
  so they obviously belong to us , right ? 
  the thing is that even if i dont care if they name their country `` greece '' , i get pissed sometimes because they actually trying to mislead human logic.putting vergina 's sun at their flag , building alexander 's statues and saying that their ancestors are the ancient macedonians are hilarious because as i said above they came 1 thousand years latter.even tho its proven that they macedonians were greeks it seems like they are trying to take the history of a whole nation just because they are new country and they needed something as `` history '' . 
  i wouldnt care if they were saying what they want silently but they have a big nationalistic core that is really loud.i go there every 3-4 months to buy cigarettes.they are friendly people but when it comes to their ancestors they become really extremes . 
  well , we fly at their airspace too ... but the thing is that both countries ' media dont make any reference about their own side  . 
  i ve been in turkey 2-3 times and they are friendly people.moreover , we are connected in many ways even if we dont want to.i always have better time with a turk than a bulgarian , anonymous etc because we can make fun of each other.actually one of my best friends is turk probably thats why i like them . 
  well ... w8 i must find a post that i explain it . 
  ** from the historical point of view , there is no doubt that ancient macedonians are part of greek nation because they were born from the greek royal house named argead . 
  ** ** going to the present . 
  the so-called macedonians from fyrom , are part of the southern-slavic family . 
  slavs emigrate to balkans at 600-700 ac ( almost a millenium after alexander the great ) . greeks have been there for thousands of years.even if you suppose that ancient macedonians were n't greeks , its really hilarious to claim the whole name , since its more likely to be for them to have been mixed , not only with `` macedonians '' , but with greeks and other nations as well , let along that macedonians ( ancient ) were not that picky , to wait for the slavic migration to be mixed.this region of greece , has been always called macedonia . 
  ** ** now , you can see a country created just some years ago , trying to name itself macedonia as well!not only they have no connection from the historical point of view , they also have no connection in the ancient land 's point of view , but yet , they are claiming even greek borders !!, 
  ** [ provocation ] ( http://en.protothema.gr/fyrom-official-provoke-greece-by-raising-the-vergina-sun-flag-on-mount-olympus/ ), 
  thats not wrong tho ... if spain , portugal , greece have more `` anti-austerity '' governments many things can change in europe . 
  really ?? 
  ? it feels terrible ... you have to vote even tho you now nothing can change and the next one will do the exact thing as the previous one.only greeks feel that way ?? 
  ** country ** : greece ** favourite neighbor ** : cyprus , turkey ** least favorite neighbor ** : egh ... the anonymous country \u10da ( \u0ca0_\u0ca0\u10da ), 
  no idea but i guess not much . 
  one time, 
   was greece given money to help them ? 
  32 millions for over 200.000 refugees ( the number is not accurate ... noone knows the exact number but until 15 august the refugees were over 150.000 ) . 
   ireland , portugal , spain , italy , no body was crying out loud every day !, 
  we must understand that all these countries didnt have an unsustainable debt.unsustainable debt means that whatever you do , whatever reforms you do you will always reach a point that you will need more cuts.that means that the unemployment can not drop and in the same way taxes will be increased etc. 
  moreover , austerity in these countries has nothing to do with the austerity in greece.i understand that your opinion is the `` mainstream '' in europe but the situation in greece affects/will affect you too.so , either you solve it paying the price of relief/restructuring or you must pay the price of grexit because that is what will happen without a debt restructuring . 
  greece has a population of 11 millions ... it would simply not work ... moreover we dont have the substructures.this is not a logical question and it cant even work.i would prefer to go bankrupt because in long-terms it will be the same and probably much better.which country can keep 2 million unemployed people , with no knowledge of the language , probably no skills etc. . . ?? 
  well , imf already admitted its fault as well as greece did ... that doesnt mean that it will happen again.either you pay the price of the restructuring or you pay the price of the bankruptcy plus the geopolitical cost etc. . . its a loss-loss situation for europe . 
  yes ... the thing is that even with austerity we are going to bankrupt at one point because the debt is unsustainable ... it will happen in 1 year ? 
  ? in 10 years ?? 
  ? i dont know ... what is needed is a debt restructuring but obviously there is no political will in europe.so either we will bankrupt or the europe must pay the price of restructure.the question will be answered soon \u2122 . 
  i mean for the unemployment to be decreased we need investors.lets say that you have 1million euros and you want to invest somewhere.will you come to greece?i wouldnt because of the huge and unfair taxation and of course because everyone knows that the debt is unsustainable and a grexit wont give me back my money . 
  it wont get better ... we will see an increase for the next 6 months because of the new memorandum.as long as we take austerity measures every 6 months the unemployment will keep increasing . 
  and ? 
  ? i am not going to support any murderer ... 
  we ve seen and know what they do ... he is right ... 
  where are the good old days of dclause ? 
  +1 for / u/marktplatz but  typical german pretty sure he does n't look like [ this ] ( http://www.deutschlanduberelvis.com/.a/6a01127917f7ad28a40120a5bd7a33970b-800wi ), 
  you ... you say that i could avoid paying 3-5 euros for a splitting of water in coloseum ? 
  i ve been there when i was a kid . 
  i remember most of these places . 
  our hotel was at a small village near taormina . 
  amazing place ... 
  the only phrase i learnt from the 5 times i ve been in italy is `` una bottiglia di acqua naturalle per favore '' . 
  there is no politician in greece that claims that that part is greek . 
  i never hear the term `` north epirus '' but it 's used mostly for historical purposes as it was part of greece . 
  of course there will be far-right bitches that want it `` back '' but you ca n't say `` greeks '' as if we all hate your country or something . 
  it 's the first time i hear about this organization by the way . 
  who refers to albania as north epirus and who claims that it 's greek ? 
  yes ... 
  moreover , it was not only that . 
  according to imf , samaras stopped the implementation of austerity measures after he lost the european elections and he also pushed the negotiations for extra measures from august to february * to have a chance at the elections * . 
  the arrearages from the state to the civilians had a massive increase too . 
   it was not proven that he deleted as i said to the other guy , it was . 
  dude ... you can believe whatever conspiracy theory you want . 
  i find pretty reasonable that someone can do anything to protect his career .
