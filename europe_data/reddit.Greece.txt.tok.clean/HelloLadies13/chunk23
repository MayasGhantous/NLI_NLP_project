  last time i checked , schools had numerous gaps at teachers . 
  last time i went to the hospital because m eye got infected they told me to go at a private doctor because they didnt have one due to cuts and that their equipment was 60 years old greek state spends a really low amount of money because it receives a really low amount . 
  even the public sector is lacking doctors and teachers . 
  it might be overpopulated at some sectors but that does n't mean that `` greece spends too much '', 
  why the hell did you write all these ? 
  is this a copy pasta or something and you post it `` just because '' ? 
  i literally did n't say anything . 
   greece spends too much numbers , facts instead if generic bullshits ? 
   greece spends too much perfect analysis ... 5/7 . 
  depends ... if they are working , if they are paying rent or have their own house . 
  if parents etc help ... generally , entertainment and gym memberships are declining . 
  i replaced cigs with ecig , i stopped drinking my favorite whiskey and i drink beer , i do n't care f my house is pretty , i stopped buying new clothes unless if it is absolutely necessary , i go out way less and i eat really cheap food . 
  i am a student by the way and i only work at summer . 
  until 2 years ago i did n't care for money but that was the time economical crisis hit my parents pretty hard . 
  i consider myself lucky tho ... most people are in worse situation and i know many students that their parents are both unemployed . 
  he probably live with his parents . 
  when i finish uni i will probably work for this amount of money for 5 - 6 months to a company so i can find a job abroad easily . 
  i know many people that work for free to do the same and one particular person that paid to do it . 
  greece and italian banks can not be compared with whole britain leaving the eu . 
  what kind of analogy is this ? 
  i cant believe there are people that support the coup as i cant believe there are people that support erdogan . 
  it 's a major lose-lose situation for turkey . 
  good luck neighbors . 
   the news are ~ ~ real ~ ~ biased . 
  ftfy, 
   make way too much money nop . 
   generate tons of propaganda for rich countries . 
  yep . 
  we already have the facilities , they just need renovation . 
  the idea will probably have a positive impact . 
  if you give us free money to fix the abandoned olympics facilities then ... yes !, 
  it will be our pleasure ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  agreed ... ca n't believe people believe this crap . 
   you work from 20 to 45 . 
  i mean ... what the fuck .

  no ... we had barely a surplus . 
  moreover , lets not discuss how we achieved that surplus . 
  we had surplus this year too by the way . 
  3,5 % surplus does n't let you grow . 
  investors know that in order for you to achieve it you must implement more austerity measures ( like it happens now , as we speak ) and will never invest in your country . 
  add that to the rest of the reasons ( unsustainable debt , high taxation already etc ) they have to do not invest and you end up with more of the classic good-old austerity . 
   regling said that a ** 3.5 percent primary surplus target ** , which greece has agreed to achieve in 2018 , should be respected . 
  what bullshit are they smoking ? 
  i want some ... 
  nice misleading comment . 
  it 's as misleading as the book cover of frankenstein by mary shalley . 
  i just saw the video and he was basically exposing the fake news that were everywhere and was saying that until then there was no credible example of terrorists , which is true . 
  other than that , he is saying that in order for that example to do not exist the unhcr must not be underfunded like it is and that countries must do more to make the application process more quick and accurate . 
  but lets watch half of the video and post our bullshits in reddit for ez karma . 
  ayyyyyyy ... someone has a different opinion tha me !, 
  lets stop taking him seriously . 
  it 's a comedy show . 
  thx god you are not taking seriously when he flames latvia but other than that he is making a point whether you agree or not . 
  you can buy anything online actually ... the country that you live doesnt matter . 
  i have opposed many pro-eu views and i ve gained enough upvotes .

   but you know what ? 
  liberty is never given , it needs to be earned , constantly . 
  thats the biggest bullshit i ve seen for a long time.liberty is in our nature . 
   sure , with capitalism & the `` free '' market any time not spent on your personal finances puts you at a disadvantage ( e.g. 
  if i do n't work every waking hour i ca n't pay rent ) , but that is also a political policy and thus up to the people to change if they do n't like it .

  noone really met the criteria back then.almost every country ( maybe all ) according to strauss kahn did change the numbers and everyone knew about each other.greek political scene and the greek economy did n't have the ability to overcome the deficits ... that 's / was the problem . 
  if i were you i would do [ that ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?q=maritime+law ) . it ` ld make you feel less smartass , 
  i am not sure if you heard what he said.you cant do anything about that.if you raise taxes they will change flag etc. . . 
  the only thing that makes the greek ships , greek , is the flag ( not always ) and that they may pay `` taxes '' ( huehueheuehue ) . it doesnt matter where your company is.i dont know about africa , tho.i also know that its difficult to find greeks nowadays at those ships.even the ships are made at bangladesh etc , instead of greece.from 2002 to 2014 they ve wasted 140 billions on new ships etc , and they didnt pay shit . 
  this bullshit started from the junta and it was a deal between them and [ a famouw shipowner ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aristotle_onassis#shipping ) . now , the same problem exists everywhere . 
  the truth is that when you got a ship , you dont give a fuck about what countries say.you can change your flag and you move on . 
  read [ this ] ( http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/eurozone-greece-shipping/ ) ( the last paragraph ), 
  greece doesnt get much money from shipping fleets . 
  [ varoufakis said something about that . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/7kls06qtwne?t=591 ), 
  when you devalue the currency exports are becoming cheeper and imports more expensive.its a sacrifice you have to make in order to become more competitive on the global market.i wont deny that there a risk for inflation because of the aggressive demand.devaluation raises growth and improves the balance of payments and creating jobs . 
   greece 's problems have nothing to do with the currency . 
  oh it does.the idea of having one central bank that can implement one economic measure for 19 different countries is bad . 
  let me give you an example : you have greece and you have germany.germany needs revaluation of the currency because its booming.on the other hand greece needs devaluation . 
  so you have one central bank that can implement only one measure.so in the end , whatever economic policy ecb implements is bad-not so bad or good-not so good for the countries.thats why we have austerity ( straight cuts ) . because the ecb is ineffective.the way ecb is trying to balance this ineffectiveness is with growth funds but it will never be as effective as having your own currency . 
  this is not news ... this is why many people say that euro can not work.this is the problem.that you have 19 countries and one central bank.the only way euro can work this way is by implementing the us model , that wont happen in the near feature for political and social reasons . 
   christian holidays you mean those periods that have nothing to do with christianity anymore , like eve and christmas?bring me those gifts !!!, 
   my point is that while many things do pollute , we should do everything we can to decrease that pollution . 
  agreed . 
   and maybe we will get rid of cars some day - it 's a worthy goal . 
  until you find something that useful and completely healthy then there is no hope for that.probably , we wont live until that point but lets hope . 
  when did i say that?i just laughed at that sentence.by the way you will never have clean air as long there are cars anyway so yeah ... you should abandon all hope . 
   it returns to me the freedom to walk down the street with clean , healthy air . 
  most things people do nowadays pollute the air . 
  many people die to addiction problems related to heroin.i dont know what this man is talking about .

   you would need around 2,701.56 $ in nicosia to maintain the same standard of life that you can have with 2,400.00 $ in athens ( assuming you rent in both cities ) . 
  this calculation uses our cost of living plus rent index to compare cost of living . 
  this assumes net earnings ( after income tax ) [ source ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=greece&amp;city1=athens&amp;country2=cyprus&amp;city2=nicosia ) cypriots take 500 euros more tho ... you see the money but not the cost of living . 
  another comparison :  you would need around 5,997.03 tl ( 1,785.70 $ ) in ankara to maintain the same standard of life that you can have with 2,400.00 $ in athens ( assuming you rent in both cities ) .
