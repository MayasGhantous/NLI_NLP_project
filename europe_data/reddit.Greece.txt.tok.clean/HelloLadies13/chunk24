  well , good point.the reality is that they dont really have oversight.i remember that the leaks from edward snowden were exposing many illegal , unconstitutional and unauthorized programs of nsa.so either the government didnt know or they knew but they didnt care.then again , we must open a new conversation about who keeps an eye on the governments . 
  so you dont understand the difference between whole monuments and artifacts obtained by war and a fraud supported only by an unofficial italian record?ok ... 
  ? no thx ...

  sorry for the mistakes . 
  *** cersei lannister --  angela merkel *** the crafty , fan of authority and bad princess of kings landing , cercei , looks like angela.cercei says , allegedly , thatshe cares for the luck of the people the same way angela cares for greece . 
  *** john snow --  alexis tsipras *** ** spoiler allert ** ~ ~ at the last episode the bastard son of ned stark is being stabbed , sneakily , but many people are waiting for his return.many also believe that alexis will make it against europeans and he will return ... with money . ~ ~ ** white walkers --  christine lagard ** white walkers are cold dead creatures and hate everything that is alive.something like troika that wants to drink our blood . 
  you can compare them to mr.shauble too that when he arrived at eurogroup ( and winter came to our hearts ) he said : `` we 've shown solidarity to greek people '' . at the same time , mr.dijjsebloam is feeling pessimist about the deal and mrs.lagard ( if we remove hermes from her body she looks like a white walker indeed ) said that `` when we give a loan , the money are comming from senegal , from sri lanka and switzerland.thats why we need to be trustworthy because we give as loan their money . '', 
  ** princess targarien --  greece ** the princess is creating turbulence to the 7 kingdoms at the same way greece is creating to europe.she decided to wake up the slaves and lead a rebel against the establisment the same way greece does with europe . 
  ** jamie lannister --  yianis varoufakis ** the sex sympol of westeros reminds us of the minister , yiannis.the charm of the 2 men was hurt when jamie 's arm mutilated and when yianis watched his `` wings to be cut '' from the negotiations . 
  i dont know if it is true but all the greek sites publish it.the first file is what europe showed to the last eurogroup and the second one is what juncker is showing now .

  translate of the most crucial part : ** everyone that applied and will apply for retirement after 31/12/2014 will face new cuts.according to the ex fm mr koutroumanis , who drafted the law , the new way to calculate the pensions leads to a escalated cut of 7 % to 25 % with the passage of time .

  hello guys , i need to point out something that most greeks know but most of you use it as a fact which is wrong . 
  the old government used some strange ways to achieve growth and surplus.first of all , the reforms that we implement right now was scheduled to negotiated before exactly one year.troika and nd delayed it until the early 2015 and thats why we have n't received a single installment since last august.moreover , there was a huge raise at overdue accounts ( i am not sure if this is the right word , though ) that the country owes to private investors .

  ** ** according to imf , the worst senario which is the dominant , at 2022 the debt will be at 142,2 % of gdp , 25 points higher than the last predictions.what means that ?? 
  ? that there will be a gap of 50bn ** you see its not about growth and surplus even if they were legit.its about following the program without losses.every wrong prediction means money loss .

  a few green leaves around the rusty stones colour red and the aspalathus bushes ready , showing their long needles and their yellow flowers . 
  not far away the ancient columns , threads of an harp echoing still . 
  tranquility - what may reminded me of that man ardieus ? 
  a word of plato i suppose lost in my brain 's ditches . 
  the name of the yellow bush did not change all this time . 
  in the night i found the excerpt : `` they tied him in hands and feet '' , he says , threw him down and skinned him , drew him farther and tore him apart , over the aspalathus thorns , grabbed him and left him as a rag down in tartarus . '', 
  and so , in the nether world , paid his sins ardieus from pamfylia , the sordid tyrant . 
  ------------------------------- this is g.seferis last poem , and was published three days after his death ( 23/9/71 ) , in vima newspaper , during the junta era in greece . 
  it is based on an excerpt of plato 's `` politeia '' , referring to the afterlife punishment of the unfair and especially ardieus , a tyrant who had murdered his father and his older brother . 
  because of this , his punishment - and all tyrants in general - in the nether world was terrible . 
  when the tyrants got the usual punishment of the unfair and were ready to come out into the light , the orifice did n't let them out and roared . 
  `` at the same time , some wild men nearby who knew what that roar stood for , grabbed ardieus and the other tyrants , tied them down at hands and feet and beat and scratched them bad . 
  then , they drew them out the road through the aspalathus thorns and tore them apart and at the end they drove them down to tartarus . '',

  it was set to music by nikolaos mantzaros , and is the longest national anthem in the world by length of text . 
  in 1865 , the first three stanzas ( and later the first two ) officially became the national anthem of greece and , from 1966 , also that of the republic of cyprus .
