  nd always flirts with gd ... some of their members actually could be in gd.their positions are really far right.the truth is that after samaras became the president of nd they turned a bit more to the extreme.thats why he had a conflict with the old president.now i dont know what will happen with the new one . 
   it is protecting your ** own ** citizens over others yeah ... your own citizen could be a pedo or a criminal and you ld probably not even like him but who gives a fuck ... lets kill some children . 
   you get being a fucking cultural marxist . 
  because i dont want to shoot migrants ?? 
  ? are u out of your empty mind ? 
  turks will invade with guns to kill me fucking shit not to get a better life . 
  i know ... and this is sad.labeling you as a racist is an argument.i just considered that the cause is known . 
  yeah you are right ... you didnt make any discrimination . 
   there is a difference between own people and a mass of violent illegal foreigners of unknow background . 
  racism : prejudice , ** discrimination ** , or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one 's own race is superior/special . 
  it is really comfortable to be so far away from middle east isnt it ? 
  one question ... do your policemen kill polish people that throw rocks at demonstrations ? 
  ok guys ... lets start killing people because they thr\u03b5w some rocks or because they pushed some policemen.fucking weird world . 
  yeah ... take that guy to prison ... wtf is this logic . 
  i dont speak about the police.with this logic we should shoot everyone that pushing in demonstrations.ehm ... i forgot ... they are not migrants . 
  how about fuck you?they dont have weapons . 
   stop them from reaching greek territory in the first place . 
  obviously you dont know how things work with migrants.if they join the greek territory which is pretty easy because ... eh ... water and turkey , you cant do nothing . 
  [ losers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egnf4hgmcvo ), 
  well , a common student life in greece costs many : 1 ) 200 euros rent ( to athens and thessaloniki , at heraklion and giannena is 250-400 ) 2 ) 200 euros for food ( well , i pay more because i am too bored to cook ) 3 ) extra to go out 4 ) 150/4 months for electricity ,20 / 2 months for water , +20 / month for phone + internet , + heat the thing is that 27 % of people are unemployed and you cant find a job as a student.its quite difficult to pass a normal student 's life these days.you see the poverty inside the school sometimes and you hear about co-students that their both parents are unemployed but they still sacrifice everything to educate their kids . 
  difficult times indeed ... i bet in romania is the same . 
  greece 800 ( but we have 27 % unemployment ) euros , romania 400, 
  1500 euros for romania is like 5 wages ... this is insane . 
   do you have delays in your study ? 
  well , until last year you could study for as look as you wanted.you can finish most universities in greece at the 4th year ( technical studies 5 years , medical 6 ) . so there were a big number of what we call `` eternal students '' that had abandoned their studies and were doing something else.they were even 50-60 years old.this is not happening anymore and all these people were deleted this year.of course they had lost their privileges ( cuts at tickets etc ) decades before . 
  now we can study for the standard years ( 4-5-6 ) +2 . i study economics and that means that until the 6th year i must finish . 
   and did you and your parents actually save money in advance ? 
  well , as i said there is not any fee in greece.your parents must pay your cost of living because as you may know its hard to find a job especially as a student ( there will always be an unemployed person that is willing to work 12/day for 200 euros ) . 
  the income of my family is 1,7 k euros/month ( in 1-2 months it will be more but thats another story ) which for nowadays i guess its the a bit over the average.with these 1,7 k money my family has to pay my cost of living , my brothers cost of living ( he studies in another town ) and their cost of living.its pretty hard but i am lucky to say that my eyes have seen terrible things . 
  the problem with greece is that you cant save money right now ( i mean the big majority ) because whatever you make usually goes to taxes etc.you are just trying to be adapted at that moment . 
   also how busy is your study ? 
  at the first semester i had something like 12 hours/per week and at the second 15/week . if you are in a technical school you must go necessarily for 10/week and another 10-12 / week if you want.the economical university that i study does not oblige us to go but if you want to finish ... you must . 
  ? oh shit.in us , i guess that every university demands a different fee ( or not ? 
  ) . was your university expensive or cheap in relation with the other universities ? 
  phd on my university at economics is 2k :( ( ( (, 
  yeah i know ... england is really expensive.i know many greeks that go to edinburgh to avoid the fees instead of england but they still complain about the cost of living . 
  wow ... you are a bit fucked . 
  2k for netherlands is a high or a small amount ?? 
  ? i mean for the economical situation of the average family . 
  full ?? 
  ? the state give us 50 % cut for trains , buses etc for free :d i should not give ideas to wolfgang tho ... 
  hahahaha ... why ? 
  my birth . 
  i am ok ... i am actually stayed late tonight to read.i got exams at september.i am actually reading economical theory right now.i failed to pass this damn course on last semester and i need to pass it right now !, 
  i also miss my gf ... she is sick and she went at her parents ' home.i am planning to cook something special for her when she will return to the place we both study.i dont know what yet.i am focusing on reading . 
  missing my gf too ... she is fucking sick for 2 weeks now and she went at her parents ' house . 
  relevant flair.tell me that you also [ wear this ] ( http://www.any-news.gr/media/k2/items/cache/2b9b72303a195511df58deb3249f170b_xl.jpg ) :d, 
  they are not silent i guess.just before a couple of years greek medias were showing them constantly and when they understood that they did a huge bullshit they stopped . 
   samaras is an economist what a meme !!, 
  ! in 3 years i will be an economist too ... prepare yourself.helloladies13 will be a prime minister . 
  kke refuses everything ... even the anti-memorandum tag ^ ^ / s, 
   greece was over the peak when ? 
  what u mean ?? 
  ? i dont want to live in greece too ... 
  i think the battle against greece was more embarrassing :d, 
  i am not sure ... 1453 ( the conquest of constantinople ) and the next 368 years probably . 
  did i say that the airports are in excellent condition ?? 
  ? moreover who told you that the german fund ( i cant remember the name ) will fix them ?? 
  ? they will give 100millions/airport ** at the next 5 decades ** . this number is not capable to modernize anything . 
   by a political agenda yeah sorry that i dont want my homeland 's airports to be given for the price of 3 billions for 5 decades . 
  ok let me find some infos : * the first 7 months of 2015 there was a record of passengers at the greek airports.on athens ' there were 2,2 million passengers , on heraklion 's ( crete ) 1,2 millions , ** on rhodes ' 900.000 , on thessaloniki 's 700.000 and on corfu 600.000 etc ** . all these until now.in general 26,2 million passengers were transported from greek airports until july . 
  * ** economical situation : ** i couldnt find numbers but only statements.for example : rudolf hicker ( professor in bremen ... i dont know if he is reliable but everyone says almost the same ) : * `` in fact , there is just a simple change of ownership.its important that the income , the crucial income of these airports will go to german hands . 
  * * this income will be missing from the greek treasury.what about the billions from the privatisation?greece wont be able to use noone of them to invest or for any developmental policy.wolfgang took care of it . 
   most of the airports in question are too small thessaloniki 's airport is big and moreover the rest of the airports are really popular.mykonos , corfu , rhodes , santorini ... are u kidding me ?? 
  shut up ragnar !!!, 
  if my country dont ask for warranty then its our fault ... lol.moreover what you mean `` germany will ... invest '' ?? 
  ? of course germany is not going to invest in greece and of course greece didnt invest in romania and bulgaria.if i come to your country and buy an airport i bought it . . not greece . 
  i dont want to see the answer ... 
   yes because greece only wants to borrow money , but not do the shitty stuff they needed to do alot earlier . 
  yeah greece didnt do anything the last 5 years ... now ... tell us about the life on mercury ... 
  [ here you are ] ( http://www.privateislandsonline.com/areas/greece ), 
  sorry dude ... but 100millions/airport in 50 years is not modernization.moreover , i am not sure about the jobs and i wont judge until i see it with my own eyes . 
  thats because of low prices ... if you have time search about ppc ( public power coorporation ) and you will understand . 
  sorry ... but noone blames the investors.they do their job . 
  moreover what u mean `` promise '' ?? 
  ? if they signed then you have the right to take the `` billions '' back.otherwise your country made a huge mistake . 
  for 50 years but i guess the renewal will be easy . 
  this is happening the last 5 years ... 
  i doubt that they will.i think varoufakis said before some months that the country loses 1 million/day because of ose . 
   or for how long ? 
  1,4 billion investment in 4 decades . 
   start what ? 
  yeah ... now its fine . 
  / s dude this is the definition of clearance . 
  1,2 billion euros ... shit . 
  but but ... greece is planning to do deals with russia because we want to threat europe.that is what europe said when greece signed with russia but for a strange reason they could n't remember that germany had signed the previous day . 
  holy fuck ... you are awesome . 
  take my upvotes sir . 
  are u trolling yourself ? 
  fuck these guys ... before the vat reform they raised their prices and when the vat reform came into table they said `` we love you and we wont let you pay the extra vat '' . 
  i am mad . 
  yeah ... now with worst memorandum of all time it will ... for sure . 
  good joke m8 ... 
  rekt . 
  well now ?? 
  ? now u can do nothing ... let me ask you something.if i come to america and kill some million people , leave you poor and capitalize your resources will you be willing to let me educate you ?? 
  ? the problem starts from decades before and i dont know how we can deal with it.if we use weapons in 10-20 years we will have the same problem . 
  oh yeah right ... u tried too much to educate them ... 
  its not only the invasions ... its not only the millions of dead people.its the capitalization of their land and their resources.they were poor while they were rich on resources.they dont have education and its our fault . 
  of course i dont support what happens ... dont tell me that i am isis support for fucks shake but i clearly remember that greece was spending 1 million euro per day on iraq invasion for nothing .
