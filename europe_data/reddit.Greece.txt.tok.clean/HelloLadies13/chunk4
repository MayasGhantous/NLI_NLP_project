  they are our creation ... rip man . 
  they are our creation idiot ... if we werent so fucking dumps they wouldnt exist from the first place.stop saying bullshit and accept the fact that we are rensposible . 
  yeah sorry i am dumb and u are smart ... i didnt say that the aljazzera is the heaven of objectivity but its better to watch the others ' shit when it comes to your problems.unless if you think that european medias are not manipulating their viewers . 
   austerity bites portugal as much as greece . 
  ok ... then i am sure that portugal has not any problem to exchange their economic indicators with ours . 
  plz portugal < 3 < 3 < 3, 
  well actually trust it when it comes to issues on west.to be fair i dont really follow the situation on middle east ... i have more serious here : s, 
  actually aljazzera is more objective than any other western media . 
  what u mean its bullshit ? 
  i know ... i said it for the bulgaria-fyrom, 
   `` freedom or death '' is rather popular on the balkans , we 've had it in bulgaria , the serbs used it , but you went and made it a national motto . 
  freedom or death is the motto of the country decades before you mention it.the story is from 1821 . 
   it would have done that regaradless of were the crisis was taking place . 
  of course ... noone said that germany has something personal with greece . 
  no shit . . this is not new.every year we see articles on how germany is making profit from the crisis . 
  * germany is profiting from the debt crisis by saving billions of euros in interest on its government debt , which has enjoyed a steep drop in yields due to strong demand from investors seeking a safe haven .

   first of all greeks are the one to fix it . 
  u really dont know that any greek government cant do anything without the permission of the creditors eh ? 
   that country has never produced anything worth while besides weapons . 
  facepalm, 
   the current situation isnt sustainable either way . 
  hallelujah  nobody is afraid of a grexit anymore . 
  obviously some bigger guys than you and me are afraid . 
  we thought the same when they told us back in 2010 that we must pass 1-2 bad years but since then imf made 2-3 completely bad predictions.nothing is predictable . 
  so why after the no vote europe didnt kick out greece ?? 
  ? either you are smart and they are idiots or just the european leaders know better.moreover you didnt give me any proofs about what you say.who said that nobody will feel anything ? 
  this is not true at all ... give me a proof ... i can tell you that the greek 's economy deficit at 2010 was 15 % of gdp which was almost similar to uk and us deficit for example ( ok obviously there are a lot of differences i am just pointing out the number ) . 
  when ? 
   will inevitably go back to where it 's at right now . 
  source ?? 
   your joking right ? 
  merkel and tons of eu leaders were talking about a grexit openly before the referendum ... after that only wolfgang was talking about it.all the others were opposed.politics ... moreover , you think its easy to kick a country of nato out of europe ?? 
  ? its not only the economical risk , its the geopolitical too which right now is huge . 
   the bailouts should never of happened in the first place and greeks should of been left to their own devices back in 2010 . 
  the world is afraid of grexit even now ... back then it would be a total disaster.the greek economy was much-much stronger and the whole world was on crisis . 
  the 180.000 you saw is actually young `` educated '' ( as the medias say ) people.actually now that i am searching i cant find the 500.000 but i am pretty sure that i heard it 3-4 times on tv ( not the best source obviously ) . 
  the last 5 years over 500.000 ( 1/20 of the population ) . the last one year we dont know yet :p . 
  we will see in 5 months .

   ah it \u00b4 s you again ... fuck off i am sure we can all say the same to you in every thread about greece.your posts are always identical.there are many guys here that are opposed to greece for what happens the last years but at least they have judgement and they `` feed '' their mind without crying like a child , like you do . 
  yeah ... because npos [ are not corrupted .

  well , a bit different situation.i was with my gf in rome last year and we were eating pizza but it was awful.so i told her in greek `` what a bullshit ... we should go somewhere else '' . the waitress heard me and when we finished our food i asked her to pay and she told me in greek `` you dont have to because you didnt like the food '' and smiled . 
  i felt really bad.we left the money on the table and we ran away :p, 
  probably thats why they became nobelists.the fear and the powerful experiences make you think different i guess . 
   athens is a unique amazing city are you malakas ? 
  lol ... 
   easy, 
  i want a time machine !!, 
  well ... probably istanbul / constantinople ... i did the mistake to search the whole city and except tourist places the other parts were ugly and dirty.but to be fair i guess this kind of thing fits to many cities including athens on top of the list . 
  nowadays this is cheaper than buying a normal house at the centre of london . 
  i do n't want to open the link ... really ... i do n't . 
  hello :-), 
  i do n't understand you either.behind putin there are many million people who get manipulated just like you do.instead of generalize everything you should cure your wounds.its another thing to argue with putin and another with the whole russia.they are humans after all.that goes to russians too . 
  arrest her !!, 
  well ... i save this post ... its really funny . 
  you have 60 % unemployment in lithuania ? 
  what an insult ... i am sure you felt offended because eh ... a country gave honors to some dead people ?? 
  i was smoking a cigarette when i opened the map ... i felt guilty and dirty . 
  you ve got one mistake ... pasok is not a left party.they are socialists . 
  well ... there was a period of much spending but junta accomplished with propaganda to make people believe that everything was ok.unfortunately many people want junta back ... can u believe this ?? 
  politically speaking , the leftists gained points from the uprising and the right wing still refuse some things like dead people etc but without success because many people remember what was going on.in general the uprising gave birth to some politicians that into later destroyed greece.for example many mps of the old pasok fought against junta.people voted for them because of that.who knew that these kids will turn into corrupted motherfuckers . 
  on the other hand at the time of junta many brilliant poems , songs were written and they are a gift to us ... the next generations . 
  holy shit ... wtf ?? 
  shhhhh ... british and spanish boys will get mad / s, 
  this idiotic logic of emigration.everyone emigrate !!, 
  ! already 500.000 greeks left the country and the problem that we will face in 10 years because of that will be huge.you ca n't let 3 million people emigrate.wtf is wrong with you ... edit : `` with you '' i mean the people who support this logic . 
  well , the fact is that in greece people like russia more than any european country . 
  hahahaha ... i remember that you were begging to face us at the finals to take revenge.sweet , sweet portugueses :-), 
  hello british boy with the sad penis.look at france ... / s, 
  it 's cypriot ... not greek  unless if you mean greek = cypriot which is fair enough.haloumi is a cheese that you literary love it or hate it.i love it too but i prefer the cretan mizithra . 
  where are we ?? 
  ? i thought that everyone loves us ... ^ / s, 
  that is what they say to people to follow them.their prime goal must be different.i do n't know how they can achieve their goal which probably is power and land by provoking countries like turkey . 
  rip neighbor ... even if i do n't understand what isis is trying to do.they are provoking really big countries . 
  really ? 
  ? people were not scared of them ?? 
  there is a a nobel about spinalonga --  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_island_ ( hislop_novel ) and a serial based on the book that it is the best serial of greek tv, 
  we ve got like 11-12 cheeses ... feta is the most famous . 
  can i find books or movies ?? 
  i am more scared of wolfgang than russia and isis together . 
  is this a reference at eurovision 2005 ? 
  greece : 10pm at taverna ,1 am at club and the next day you wonder where did you spend all your money . 
  someone must explain this to troika too . 
  i still downvote you because i can !!, 
  prepare for a new color because we will reach 30 % in 3-6 months.we fucking win !!, 
  hello . 
  of course no ... i just say that it exists and the fact that this `` far-right '' or `` far-left '' opinion is getting support by a majority does n't mean that it is right.these opinions can get support by anyone just because of some conditions like fear , misinformation . 
  oh ok ... one more bild reader who does n't have any idea . 
  good night . 
   populism probably you are not one of the thousants that killed themselves because of crisis or you are not one of these parents whose [ kids are starving and they ca n't do nothing ] ( http://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/world/europe/more-children-in-greece-start-to-go-hungry.html?referrer=&amp;_r=0 ), 
  cappuccino 1,80 ??? where ?? 
  remove kebab is pretty usual . 
  for reports : someone , that i do n't want to say his name , told me once : `` i prefer to give my money to dirty gypsies rather than lazy greeks . 
  `` i reported the message , you deleted and the next day the same guy was making caustic comments again.wasn ' t ban necessary for a small period ?? 
  ? why gypsies are dirty and greeks lazy ? 
  because the majority of people support an idea means that it is n't far-right ??
