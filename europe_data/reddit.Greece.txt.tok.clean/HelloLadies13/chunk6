  you smart bastards ... ^ kappa, 
  sounds like a good plan / s, 
  its ok to hear stories but becareful for wishes.he is well-known for his misfortune, 
  the only thing i hear when he speaks is `` i love hitler , i love hitler , i love hitler etc '', 
  what can we do ?? 
  ? they sent a f16 and we sent one too ... they both play a bit and then both leave.this happens for decades . 
  this happens every week guys ... there is nothing new here.we got used to it and thats why you never hear about it . 
  / u/zeus ... i knew it was you !!, 
  ! you crazy bastard :-d, 
  yeah maybe you are right ... sorry we had to refuse something that we were sure that it wont fix anything.not that we achieved something better but anyway . 
  [ look why we need 50 bn ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3b80ri/tsipras_reportedly_confides_to_other_eu_leader/csjvsgp ) well the story is a bit different from what i wrote because my memory sucks a bit :-p, 
  they do n't need them suddenly.if you were greek i could provide you sources from 2012 when the imf was again wrong.instead of having 0 % growth we had -3,7 % and instead of having 177 billions gdp we had 170 . the dmg was counted as 50 billions until 2022 . 
  ~ ~ moreover , i need to remind you that ecb could keep the banks open but didnt ... ~ ~, 
  [ i can only give you an example ] ( http://rt.com/news/241985-greece-anti-poverty-law/ ), 
  / u/mfukar you crazy bastard ... i knew it was you . 
  oh stop saying bullshits please.thx you . 
  they are ... it is called [ unilateral actions/moves ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-says-greek-prime-minister-due-in-brussels-next-week-1422619976 ) take one example and search google for more you bild 's victim !!!, 
  they will never do it.they prefer grexit instead of losing their powerful seats . 
  cya soon for the next episode of the greek dra ( ch ) ma european folks . 
  we had growth the last year because the last government and troika denied to make negotiations at the last summer that was scheduled and postponed it for early 2015 ( february :-) ) . moreover , the old government stopped paying the arrearages that the state owes to the private sector . 
  the growth was not even enough to fix the losses at the predictions of 2012-2013 , though, 
  we ve talk about how this surplus was created on / r/greece . go there and search.you will find many sources on how it was virtual and the old government made it . 
  ps.we had surplus only for 2014, 
  i go there to buy smoke ... it is nice . 
  the primary surplus was virtual.everyone in greece know it . 
  or appreciate his work that is actually affecting our lives ?? 
  please learn what communism is and stop using this word for no reason . 
  well , the thing is that he cant do anything more.the only thing he can do is to convince people.as i said before 2 days : varoufakis wasted himself.we needed him when he could act alone without the imf and the troika above of his head . 
  its hard to be a minister when you cant do anything.the truth is that greece did n't have governments the last 5 years.we had the last 6 months and look the price.its true when they say that elections in greece do n't matter.the decisions is not something we are allowed to take . 
  i guess the first thing that he wanted is to show everyone that the debt is unsustainable.he was screaming for it and everyone was laughing back in january.then we heard the nsa report and the imf report.now he is trying to convince everyone that the ez was cruel and of course the same time to show that he had a plan ( parallel currency , to cut the bonds with the ecb and to take back the ownership of the bank of greece ) that wasnt allow to activate . 
  i am not saying that he is not narcissistic or anything.he is ... but his words is the only thing you know about what happend behind the doors of eurogroup . 
  well , last days he said really important things.the silence of the opposition smells like guilt.its hard to imagine that they do n't care when they know that he has a huge audience . 
  how can greece help the poor when the governments cant take any decision without asking troika ? 
  ? i guess s-bots do n't get it . 
  because before syriza we did n't need a new bailout ... [ sure ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/sb10001424127887324299104578527202781667088 ) . 
  cost dude ... its all about the cost :-), 
  can someone tell me if there are any rumours on how georgia is going to act ?? 
  who cares for the moon anyway ... 
  he is studying pharmacy at a private university in sofia.there are many rich guys especially from turkey ( i am not being racist ... just this particular university has a lot of turks ) that do n't have a clue about english and that is the only way they can pass the lessons . 
  he told me that once they ve caughtone professor but nothing happend because he was really well known in your country . 
  one reason i believe this is that is hard for a professor who gets paied shit to watch these rich dudes to have whatever they want.i, 
  well ... when he was saying that the greek debt is unsustainable you were calling him clown because wolfgang said the opposite.when wolfgang agreed because fortunately for us the imf 's report came out no-one called this fucker a clown . 
  maybe you are just prejudiced, 
  good for you then.when we joined eu we saw the living cost to rise up . 
  354 drachmas = 1 euro 50 drachmas = 1 small chocolate milk and the next day 1 euro = 1 small chocolate milk, 
  its not only the balance ... if you join eu your exporting power is immediately decreasing.why someone to buy products from you and not from other countries?moreover your living cost will become bigger the same day . 
  because you could ... i have a cousin who studies in your country.even the professors of the university ask money from the students to let them pass their lessons ... i do n't want to know what happens outside of the university . 
  ? gaben will kill you.half life iii is the correct name.pretty much ... i am not sure if i am ok with this trade though, 
  gaben wants him back ... more fame for valve = more money . 
  varoufakis quit pasok after the first big bailout because he said in public that the debt is unsustainable and that he did n't agree . 
  edit : i am pretty sure he was not a member of pasok as he is n't member of syriza.he was helping as an advisor back then . 
  i do n't get the downvoting.anyway ... the fact is that every war starts like this.one provoke , waiting for response and if he does n't get he tries to force a war by politics, 
  italy on greece ... well they shouted one of our ships and when they saw that we are not responding ( we were smart enough ) they told us that they want to pass our land and we said oxi.then the war started and we also won them :-d . mussolini was humiliated and he called hitler to fuck us . 
  then you ve lost the point of the interview, 
   you do n't debate people you owe money to . 
  shit , i owe 50 euros to my brother ... i did n't know that when he tells me to go kill my self i should do it and not tell him fuck you, 
  well , eurogroup has politicians whose prime goal is to stay in power and do not be accused for anything.imagine if rajoy vote yes for a debt relief.what will happen in spain ?? 
   source ? 
  the guy was getting prepared to introduce a new currency in greek economy !, 
  was getting prepared to introduce a ** parallel currency ** to help the banks.varoufakis was always pro-eu . 
   krugman like all other economist suffer from one problem ... they are a hoax ... social sciences don \u00b4 t exist because they can \u00b4 t predict results well ... this is ridiculus . 
   says that greeks should go suffer the pain of leaving the euro source ??? 
  i remember you to say that krugman should not have a job ( for gods sake ) ... i was sure that your opinion would be worse for varoufakis . 
  my opinion is that varoufakis wasted him self.we needed `` one '' varoufakis before imf come to our country and take the control.varoufakis should be minister when he could act alone . 
  he is a shitty diplomat , politician but a good economist.nowadays , greece doesnt need good economists because europe takes all the discussions . 
  the tax evasion in greece was 4 % higher than the rest of eu.please stop this bullshit.of course we have problem but higher vat , pension/wages cuts dont solve the problem.probably they make it worse . 
  you cant read obviously ... you posted a link that says that the cost of living in athens is huge comparing to bucharest and u did n't understand it.rofl . 
  can you ? 
  oh shut the fuck up ... i got my anger right now and i ve got these guys to tell me how jealous they are about my beautiful grave . 
  yes ... 2 million people to go abroad ... what a brilliant logic.already 500.000 left the country . 
  good ... wolfgang need more toys . 
  lol ... this post is full of bullshit ... do u know anything about economics or especially about economics in ez ? 
  its not about how much you get paid but how much you pay at the end of the months ... you guys do n't seem to understand it.we have twice your cost of living , huge taxation and 3,5 times higher unemployment than yours.moreover this is not a fight forwhich one has the biggest dick , our average salary is 500 euros but our expenditures are much more than urs if you want the agreement go demonstrate for it ... it will be fun . 
  they are trolling ... i cant believe what i am seeing . 
  go demonstrate for the agreement then ... it will be fun . 
  and this is an excuse ?? 
  ? we lost 25 % too ... we are not begging for more lol ... 
  demand it then ... lol ... i am sure you will be happy with the massive gdp fall ... you guys are crazy ... 
  are you sure u understand the agreement ?? 
  ? you do n't really seem to ... 
  do you believe that this agreement will boost any economy ? 
  ? it has cuts to wages and pensions and huge taxation.are guys mad ?? 
  you cant be serious ... 
  they wont get money at all ... like we did n't get for this program that expired, 
  yes and europe promised that will fix this shut but they ve done worse ... 
  this is bullshit of politicians ... trust ... if they do n't do these freaking things they wont get money ... here is your trust.do you guys really believe that this is about trust ?? 
  jtjfjdjjjro8rkrjjrodkdjronrir ... ** because we wont get money if we do n't **, 
  troika is still in athens but changed his name to brussels group, 
  ghhhhhhhhhhhhh ... i do n't see any reform for curroption at these 12 measures !!, 
  ! unless if you speak about the taxes ... then you must be joking because the institutions deleted that law, 
  source for no-one ? 
  [ take it back ] ( http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=e36jlhntzta ), 
  but in greece low incomes are taxed.you pay taxes even if you do n't get anything.moreover , where do you see any reform for corruption ? 
  ? i only see gdp slashes . 
  one question . 
  who is poorer ... the guy who takes 500 euros but has to pay 900 at the end of the month or the guy who takes 250 and pays 300 ? 
  imf wants a government of technocrats ... it is on the news right now . 
  funny fact : greek government wont exist until thursday . 
  you see the name `` pension system reform '' and you think that is a magical way to make the pension system reformable ? 
  ? this actually means a huge slash on the pensions of 300-400 euros.with these money u can only rent a small apartmentbut you cant buy food or pay taxes huge vat ... yes because greeks do n't pay enough already ...
