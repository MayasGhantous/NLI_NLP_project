  my parents spend 3.000-4 .000 euros per year for heat . 
  i am greek dude ... i know what you are talking about but 49 % was really high . 
  i want a link about the 49 %, 
  ? link plz ... dont even look.you dont have . 
  lol ... so its mr v 's fault that the debt is unsustainable and if we dont say no in september we will have new negotiations for new austerity package ?? 
  ? i dont think so.people were committing suicides all these 5 years but you just never knew.dont be idiot.they didnt start today.we have a lot more to remember from just an oldman.we got used to it . 
  shhhhhh ... dont wake them up . 
  wow ... you are fast . 
  i am trying to find a translation ... w8, 
  you dont see any conversation here ... in greece we talk about the past all the time . 
  the answer is obvious . 
  ** absolutely yes **, 
  yes = oligarchs = power, 
  i will translate the red lines ( sorry for my english ) : the poll 's / social potential in the favor of yes should be impressed ranked from the poll companies , so it will be visible ( it will be fake in other words ) that there is a potential/trend in favor of yes.not with homogeneity percents , because people are suspicious of the pollsters . 
  on the other hand , on friday , which is the last date that law permits the polls to be snown , there should be a general win in favor of yes , so that there will be no doubt , but without making the people `` wake '' . a difference between 5-10 points depending to each company.write down that similarly in referendums abroad `` yes '' is usually represented `` silently '', 
  you hurt my feelings, 
  pancakes ... even if crepe is better ... / s, 
  just to know ... with these comments the no is becoming bigger . 
  kisses to mr.schulz from greece ... thx for showing us what to vote ... 
  salzburg ... i ve been there and it was amazing ... 
   let the grown ups take charge again . 
  oh my god ... you cant believe this . 
  italians know english ?? 
  ? i ve been in italy 5-6 times.i could barely communicate.most of them know french for some reason . 
   your money . 
  we ve got money now ?? 
  ? i personally have 30 euros ... i am willing to give them to any german for the sake of europe / s, 
   communists get to the power i laughed really loud with this . 
  i ve seen him cry in front of the camera before 5 months ... imagine now . 
  hmmm ... probably you are right ... anyway.the only thing i know is the choices is shit vs shit . 
  because if you get a yes the institutions wont say `` thx you greeks '' ... sure . 
  djissebloam yesterday at the eurogroup : `` we wanted to negotiate for jancker 's proposal but they are here with a new one '' . 
  what means that ?? 
  ? think about it ... 
  the proposal wont exist only if the result of the referendum is no ... 
  you didnt even answer to my question . 
   communists are paranoid yes ... we have many communists in greece nowadays ... dont u see ??? 
  ( sarcasm in case you dont understand ), 
  and ?? 
  ok bye bye greece ... we are done.i will finish my studies and i will leave . 
  potami ?? 
  ? the party that gets payed by bobolas ?? 
  ? the party that doesnt have a single program ?? 
  ? how can u vote a party without a program ... 
  ok we will have communism ... whatever you want !!, 
  pension system is not only about pension cuts ... the operating cost is huge.there are many funds ... btw you are right it was not 10 but 13 ... http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2015/06/greek-pensions, 
  ok so you know better than the imf ... good job man ... you can work for them.more austerity and in 2-3 years we wont exist.then you will be able to take back your money by selling acropoli and 2-3 islands, 
  ~ ~ greece borrowing tons of money ~ ~ euro gave to greece tons of money to save the banks and after some months imf said that [ we failed to realise the damage austerity would do to greece ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/05/imf-underestimated-damage-austerity-would-do-to-greece ) and then they come back with more austerity.how about that ? 
  insanity : doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results . 
  oh shit ... it reminds me of something !, 
  ok read what is austerity because i really believe that you dont know . 
  ok , of course you are correct but let me be the opposition ( i will speak like a greek that i am ) : * collect taxes = people can not pay and moreover a huge factor is that taxes are not fair ( they are horizontal cutbacks ) . the taxes must be fair . 
  * working social systems = no money no honey ... especially with a public sector that is cut by 33 % and has not enough doctors , teachers and taxmen * pension system : at 2009 the % of gdp for the pensions was ~ ~ 10 % ~ ~ 13 % . now its 23 % . that 's not because we are not cut enough ( pensions have been cut by 40 % ) but because the gdp felt massively.if you reduce even more the pensions you actually kill the old people.syriza wanted to merge the pension funds and create something sustainable step by step by reducing the cost of operation.its not ideal , but there is no other option . 
  * fight corruption : well first of all we have the 50 % of taxmen we had back to 2009 . but thats not the point.of course we can do it ... and we are counting on it . 
  its not about the salary ... its about how much you pay at the end of the month.if you make 500 euros and you pay 800 you are poor.moreover , you have to consider that 30 % unemployment is huge.also , almost 700.000-1 .000.000 greeks dont get payed while they are still working hoping that one day they will be payed . 
  can u define `` structural reform '' ?? 
  whatever u say my friend ... , 
  ] ( http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/satireknight/images/5/50/fuck_you.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141106081842 ), 
  probably its because many people know that both choices basically mean more death and suffer.moreover , they are tired of fighting more for everything.if you go back to 2009-2012 things were really different.people are depressed nowadays and sadly they have approved the situation, 
  yep ... 
  depends ... at 2011 we were millions ( second momerandum ) ... now both rallies probably had about 20.000-30 .000 people each.this is sad ... at 2011 we were united.look now ... 
  this is the official site for the referendum . 
  i know ... i see the links everywhere, 
  nah ... he/she is just trying to make noise about the `` yes '' rally posting new links while he/she has already one . 
  if the outcome is yes we will have new negotiations at september.imf is out prediction from 2013 when instead of having 0 % growth we had -3.7 % . 
  hahahahahaha ... [ tsipras be like ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flt9k8vljge ) woman : greece eastwood : tsipras the other guy : europe, 
  are u out of your mind ? 
  ? do you know what will happen to the global economy if euro die ?? 
  rekt . 
  imf once again ... i dont get it ... why the hell they are always wrong ? 
  ofc they are ... 
  propaganda is huge these days ... 
  i dont know m8 ... i answered to the question , 
  whatever happens it will be a referendum.probably the question will change and the position of the government . 
  we dont know yet ... greek medias say that thats mean that the deal with esm is about to cover the greek responsibilities + a reconstruction of the debt but with unknown exchange . 
  [ here you are my friend ] ( https://www.google.gr/search?q=%cf%80%ce%b1%cf%80%ce%b1%cf%81%ce%b7%ce%b3%ce%b1&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=923&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=z_crvd2nioxtu9l_opab&amp;ved=0cayq_auoaq&amp;dpr=1 ), 
  82 % -92 % ( i dont remember which one ) is returned to the european union.the other 18 % -8 % ( as i said i dont remember ) resupplied the greek banks, 
  host -  angelos fragopoulos -  favorites : others : diamantopoulou no shit --------------------------------------------------------------------- \u0394\u03b5\u03bd \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03c9 \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf ... 
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------- i agree, 
  yes = support austerity ... what dont u understand ?? 
  ? stop telling this bullshits about europe.if you want to live under 40 % of unempolyment and on a third package on the way at sempember with more austerity measures you can do whatever u want.no doesnt mean that we leave europe whatever they say to you but even if we do i dont care.i dont have furure here.its better to build something new.if the result is yes i will just take my suitcase and leave you to suffer with your vote ... if the result is no i will stay here to fight . 
  obviously yes to the austerity measures . 
  vardinogiannis , rouvas , samaras , theodorakis , adonis , pagalos will be there for sure to express their gratitude to europe for the 10.000 + suicides and the 500.000 greeks that left the country . 
  for some reason the only positive comments i see in fb is from irish people ... i was expecting more from spanish people . 
  ok ... they want suffer ... whatever u guys say ... 
  if there are only 980 million left they wouldnt let tourists take as much as they want ... common logic .

  yes ... ok . 
  oh ok ... you dont have any idea about economics ... no reason to continue this.you are just prejudiced, 
  really ?? 
  ? personally , when i open tv i just hear a propaganda against syriza ... i dont know where do you live ... 
  media is against syriza in greece ... 
  so if i flame german gonverment then i flame all germany ?? 
  ? holy crap ... i hate them all ... / s, 
  yes ... because before syriza people loved merkel.do you remember some million people demonstrate before 3 years ?? 
  ? do you remember what they used to say about her and everyone that wanted austerity ??? 
  are working at skai ?? 
  ofc ... its up to the owner if he will accept it.moreover , tourists can take as much money they want from atms ( in case you dont know ) . 
  aaaa ... because people are too afraid to take credits because if there is a grext they will lose their money . 
   germany is the only developed country in the world that has defaulted not once but twice within the last century and yet grew to be a monstrous global economic entity , far outstripping many larger countries in output and smaller ones in efficiency .
