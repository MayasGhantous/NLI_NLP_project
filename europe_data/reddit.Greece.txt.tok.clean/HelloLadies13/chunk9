  thats because greece contributed to delete their dept. 
  ok ... lets copy paste this again to everyone that thinks that the salary is what make a person/country rich . 
  1 ) [ taxation is way higher in greece than romania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tax_rates_of_europe ) 2 ) [ unempolyment in greece is 3,5 times higher than romania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_in_europe_by_unemployment_rate ) 3 ) gpd for greece is reducing while romania 's is increasing ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:gdp_per_capita_at_current_market_prices,_2003_and_2013_ ( % c2 % b9 ) _ ( eu-28 _ % 3d_100 ; _ based_on_pps_per_inhabitant ) _ yb15.png ) 4 ) [ the cost of living is way lower in romania than in greece ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=greece&amp;country2=romania ) 5 ) 1 million people in greece have 1 undeclared job, 
  the money at atms can just finish !!, 
  ! so , they must replace them.it takes a couple of hours ... ( btw this situation was until yesterday ), 
  hahahahahaha, 
  i dont care ... macedonias/fyromians/skopjans ( whatever everyone wants ) know that it will be a big hit to their economy.albania will get a big hit too ( i think 500.000 albanians are working in greece ) and bulgaria a smaller . 
  40 % of tourists are from greece.moreover most of your exports are going to greece.your dentists , restaurants are working because almost everyday many greeks are coming there because the products are much cheaper.i am coming there once a month to buy cigars for example . 
  if greece leaves the eu probably macedonia/fyrom/skopje ( whatever everyone wants ) will just bankrupt or at least suffer even more . 
  ? its 170 billions euros now ... anyway ... just to inform you .

  romanians are not poorer ... but you are right to everything else ... 
  this is happening the last 5 years ... 
  why ??? 
  i just remembered the last speech before the first day of the negotiations while he was under pressure.he is crying --  [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/rl17kz9haw4?t=186 ) he says `` we are every word of the constitution of this country.at this constitution we sweared.at this constitution we will serve and we will serve it until the end justifying the visions , the values , the strugles and the sacrifices of this land '', 
  can i ask you what is ur salary ?? 
  ? if you can answer ... 
  yes because if greeks vote yes europeans wont say `` thx you guys ... the proposal was always on the table '' . thats why they make a whole campaign for `` yes '' . 
  the majority of < 40 will vote no and the majority of  40 will vote yes.thats for sure ... 
  if i want to save my banks will u be my slut even if i say that i love you ? 
  [ if they lead me to this ] ( http://www.globalresearch.ca/strong-economic-medicine-the-imfs-mistakes-on-greece-are-nothing-new/5338454 ) of course ... 
  now show me the predictions of imf and see that the program failed.at 2013 they were expecting 0 % of growth while we had -3.7 and in 2014 our dept as gdp was 7.7 % higher than the expected.that means new package ... [ the wrong predictions of the imf for the first package ] ( http://www.globalresearch.ca/strong-economic-medicine-the-imfs-mistakes-on-greece-are-nothing-new/5338454 ) ... do you really want to see further ? 
  fresh start with 40 % unemployment and a 3rd package on the way ?? 
  dark meme :p, 
  ah you are right ... is better to take 200 euros and pay 700 at the end of the month.nop you are not , 
   i have very little trust in the peoples understanding of the geopolitical and longterm implications . 
  i am sure you do ... smart boy ... 
  congrats to your father and i hope your mother will make it with the store . 
  of course it doesnt ... 
  i never open it ... the problem is that the others do . 
  that is what i believe too ... but on greek tv the last days were screaming that `` juncker is attacking greek government because tsipras lied to us about vat '' etc. . . 
  if there is a bankruptcy that means literally `` the restart of the economy '' . ofc there is in long-term but it depends on the actions of the country . 
   `` institutions '' are lead by simple mathematics then we they do so many mistakes ? 
  ? dont be foul ...  who may wish to destroy the country only to stay in charge of ruins . 
  we were not waiting for the banks to shut down to say that our country is destroyed ... we already knew it . 
  just to know ... it isnt.the propaganda against `` no '' it 's huge.actually the owner was accused for some million money laundry . 
  no ... i am opposed to the european faggots that rule the union ( prison ) . 
  july *** , 
   sure if syriza signed an agreement there would have been calmness . 
  for a little while at least . 
  until unemployment reach 40 % and the old people realize the impact of pension cuts to their lives in other words ... 
  finish the program ?? 
  ? where do u live ?? 
  ? dont u read any news at all ??? 
  from the last year that we supposed to have growth and surpluses ( we all know that they were created because the old gonverment stopped paying the interior depts ) , the imf was already 7.7 % of gdp out of prediction and that means that until 2022 25 % . in the end , this is 50 bn loss and --  third package . 
  40 years right --  200 euro salary when you pay 600-700 at the end of the month . 
  in this situation when you take every 6 months austerity measures ofc it will happen.not only with syriza but with everyone . 
  so war on rome is not war against italy ??? 
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------- i love you . 
  picture 3 !!, 
  ! hahahahaha, 
  it reminds me of [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/ylwmjbx8bwa?t=86 ), 
  us dont want their currency to be `` strong '' and thats why they dont like what happens with greece.there is a reason that everyone wants 1:1,4 . the european banks can bankrupt ... [ what the weak euro and strong dollar mean for the global economy ] ( http://rt.com/business/241137-weak-euro-strong-dollar/ ), 
  how can you misrepresent a proposal that is signed from the institutions ?? 
  ? moreover , we have internet nowadays ... 
  sorry but we speaking about bunkruptcy not default ( its not the same ) . 
  yep ... everyday many greeks go there because the products are really cheep.sometimes i go too to buy cigars.it will be really hard for them to do not have the greek impact to their economy . 
  hmmm ... i just read 1 book of my university but it is a bit old ( 2005 ) ... maybe thats why it says that because of negotiations argentina should pay the 25 % of the amount . 
   it depends on where the debt was underwritten ( london , i guess ? ), 
  and what are the exact contracts . 
  really ? 
  ? i didnt know that ... 
  there is no way to take back even 1 % from greece.at least argentina had productivity.we dont . 
  :d we will probably sell our bodies ( ofc mine will get a good fortune ) / s, 
  here i am ... ask me everything :d, 
  of course it will affect you hard.albania , fyrom and bulgaria are connecting with the greek economy.especially albania and fyrom . 
  depends ... naturally the creditors lose all the amount and the interests.usually in the past there were negotiations so that the country can pay a part of the amount ( the creditors of argentina lost the 75 % of their money for example ) . 
  all these of course if greece leaves the ez ** and ** eu i guess . 
  if greece leave the ez but stay in eu then we must pay the dept with the new currency ( this is even worse ) . 
  june 24-26 ... before tsipras announce the referendum.many things have changed but yes ... the oldman-oldwoman will vote yes whatever happen so i guess the yes will win . 
  well , my answer to your replay is right above to my post to the other guy.moreover i dont think that anyone could calculate the energy that every worker put . 
  do you really exist ... i mean are u a human being or i am dreaming ?? 
  ? holy shit ... you are awesome !!, 
  sorry but i think that `` lazy '' is about eating souvlaki and drinking ouzo.productivity has to do with various things.taxation , equipment , workers etc which is affected by the economical situation.its not about laziness , unless if you believe that there are many jobs out there and we are just bored to get them . 
  greek here ... i can confirm that the old government in order to create surplus stopped paying its dept to the citizens.my father faced that too.there are many links if you search . 
  greek here ... i can confirm that the old government in order to create surplus stopped paying its dept to the citizens.my father faced that too.there are many links if you search . 
  thx u for your good words but i will vote `` no '' :d, 
  to people that say it i guess.i always answer with this [ graph ] ( http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=anhrs ) and they never answer back :d, 
  ofc there is ... the owner for some reason had some millions on his bank account ... you know what i mean . 
   greece economy actually grew ( slightly ) last year against all odds i cant read all your post because i have to go just i want to answer to this : it wasnt ... in order to raise 0.7 % of gdp for the first time and create a virtual surplus the old government stopped paying its debt to the citizens [ greek source ] ( http://www.tovima.gr/relatedarticles/article/?aid=126235 ) . 
  before 2-3 days someone had foreigh links if you search the posts that are related to greece you will find out . 
  ecb doesnt work this way.its ecb 's job to provide ela to prevent eurozone from these situations.its at his constitution.a political agreement cant affect her job . 
  moreover mr.tsakalotos said after the meeting that he had with draghi today that all is ok and tomorrow ecb will just raise the ela . 
  i do blame both.moreover , i didnt have a choise ... if you are threaten by a gun you cant do anything . 
  i know what he said ... i am focusing to the part that is related to this post.draghi wont stop the liquidity injection for sure ... why to take the blame yet when the next sunday is comming . 
  i know many people ... unfortunately . 
  aouts ... that was bad . 
  nah ... noone wants to take the blame yet . 
  financial minster of france : `` we all want greece in europe.we will keep negotiating '' . djissebloaum ( i cant even write his name ) said the same before 10 mins . 
  i can only answer to the first and the last question ( do u know that slovakia exists and where are u from ) . i know these 2 things :d, 
  where did you see that ?? 
  ? if they have an ** agreement ** ( that means that he ** agrees ** ) why he should tell people to vote no ?? 
   there are no provisions for exit from the euro . 
  thats true.the only think euro can do is to push you to leave by your own . 
  you are a or you are so dump that you think that greece is able to repay you with austerity and decrease of the income of the country . 
  keep it up ... 
  because the euro ministers have not any political reason to agree with you ... you are so smart person . 
  hello sir , now i am starting to dropping from 0 to - ... 
   it isnt their responisiblity so if i fuck your car , i must not pay.ok ... where do u live ?? 
  ? i want to burn your house then.its your problem that you wont prevent this .
