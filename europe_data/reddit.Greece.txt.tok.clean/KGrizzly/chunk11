  even the german `` bild '' was n't saying such stupid stuff . 
   i 've looked it up . 
  remember grexit ? 
  you are asking a greek guy if he remembers the term grexit ? 
  the fact that you had to look it up means that you barely remember details from a year and a half ago . 
  it should be of great concern to you that you remember only the propaganda . 
  try looking up the legal issues of how a country can exit the eu . 
  they have to initiate it themselves , the eu itself ca n't kick a country out . 
  so no matter how hard the rest of europe stomped their feet on their ground , greece can only decide * on its own * to leave or not . 
  if this :  perhaps the country itself would be split up and sold to it 's neighbors after we 'd sold off all the real estate , banks , infrastructure and whatnot . 
  was on your news , then you were watching what the cool kids now describe as `` fake news '' . 
  alternatively your memory is tainted from all the propaganda , as older cool kids have been calling `` fake news '' since the 1800s . 
   perhaps the country itself would be split up and sold to it 's neighbors after we 'd sold off all the real estate , banks , infrastructure and whatnot . 
  lol . 
  please learn how to troll better . 
  funnily enough , although you seem to despise populist right-wing movements , they are the ones that are actively against handing out your precious moneys to greek banks . 
  you should vote for wilders in the next elections ; maybe he will solve your issues . 
  i bet your hand will tremble as you cast your vote against your conscience . 
   sell off half the country lol , no you as a foreign entity ca n't sell foreign land . 
  you could come here with your dutch army to try and reclaim what 's `` yours '' though . 
  if you succeed you can also populate athos with women only to reverse the * huge * discrimination that currently takes place . 
  funnily enough , you ca n't kick us off the eu as well ; an exit has to be voluntary . 
  [ `` you are locked in here with us !, 
  '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3lsjmwno40 ), 
   like we are by bull fights in spain except that someone / something is actively * harmed * in that case . 
   greece as a whole is a place we do n't like very much , though . 
  do n't visit then . 
  also do n't employ greeks in your jobs cause they are `` lazy , stubborn and arrogant '' . 
  that cartoon sums up perfectly what the media tells you . 
  good job !, 
   violations of people 's rights if i am not allowed to be in women 's bathrooms , why should a woman be allowed in athos ? 
  it 's private property . 
  and yes , athos is the definition of a safe space . 
  it 's monasteries . 
  you should also show some outrage about how it is a violation of human rights that you as a man ca n't enter the female prayer area in a mosque , the woman ban on mount omine in japan as well as some temples in india and bali . 
  let 's see what else must be banned / unbanned worldwide according to * my * beliefs ... 
  a law is supposed to be respected . 
  you can disagree with it , but it is the law . 
  the eu `` told '' us ages ago to repeal that law and we correctly ignored them . 
   it 's the kind of thing that justifies international outrage , like our blackfaces . 
  you are dutch ? 
  i like your zwarte piet traditions , why should there be international outrage ? 
  because americans and the anglosphere have a bad image of that ? 
  you should n't care what other cultures think of your culture and traditions ; when the largest percentage of * dutch * abandon that tradition , then it will go away . 
  you can find little meaningless traditions everywhere ; if nobody is harmed then it 's not a problem . 
   because of their three year program studies etc. 
  in the past , 4 year degrees were supposed to be equivalent with a 3 year degree plus a master . 
  it also depends on where they got their degree from i believe ; not everyone is accredited and if your `` british '' degree gets you accredited in the uk , then you will get accredited here as well . 
  in greece we conflate `` private '' with paying tuition which is pretty much the norm in several countries for public uni . 
  all british universities ( except five unkown ones ! ), 
  are public despite their tuition fees for example . 
  the only country i can think of where private universities are the norm and that have several excellent ones is the usa where unis are 300-400 year old institutions with huge assets and endowments . 
  already told you ; she is breaking a law . 
  there is a law that forbids women from entering the peninsula ( \u039d . 
  also , their land is considered by the greek law as a `` house '' , so since nobody can stop me from forbidding someone from stepping in my house , no one can stop the monasteries from forbidding women to step in . 
  finally , if your `` woman with the big gun '' wanted to enter , she 'd have to get a boat or hike for km since the monasteries do n't have road access . 
  you go there mainly by boat . 
   underprivileged compared to the public ones in what way ? 
  do companies have a problem hiring you if you get a degree from them ? 
  nope . 
  will you have to \u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c7\u03af\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 your uk accredited degree with a greek one to access the public sector ? 
  yes , exactly like someone who studied in the uk would have to do . 
   if a woman were to march in with a really big gun or something police would arrive quite soon to arrest her for breaking a law . 
  that is a stupid example . 
  you can break the law everywhere with `` a big gun '' if you wish to after all . 
  you should inform the tens of private ( and fully accredited ) universities that operate in greece . 
  the fact that they operate under a different `` status '' and name does n't stop them from giving you accredited degrees from foreign universities . 
  as an older guy i know said after visiting albania , your country is really pretty but full of albanians . 
  it 's an area with monasteries where monks do n't want women visiting and as a man you need special permission to stay . 
   private universities are not allowed by law that is not true at all . 
  you should visit the island . 
  a day of hiking in fonias river while you swim in the waterfalls is amazing !, 
  it 's a great island to visit for alternative minded people , hippies etc so lots of weed is smoked over there . 
  it 's a great island in general that is quite different to most other aegean islands . 
  also , there 's still tons of rumors about satanism and the occult around there . 
  it could be because of the islands ancient history as the other redditor said but no clue why . 
   my parents are greeks get the passport and come and do your military service . 
  if you do n't want to do your military service , come and ask for i5 idvice in / r/greece . 
   ** mp44 ** christos username confirmed, 
   relllax not enough ls there to convey the sound . 
  ` member when nsa was wiretapping merkel ? 
  everybody hacks everyone . 
  it 's like a big hacking orgy . 
  i should have specified it better : there 's no reason to delve into ** and post ** about other redditors ' posting history . 
  instead of delving into the posting history of redditors you could just downvote their comment and go on with your life or ask them what they mean by that . 
  we created that timeline brah !, 
  nah , [ telephasa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/telephassa ) is the mother of europe . 
  absolutely . 
  if you have a vagina you * may * be opposed to female circumcision . 
  if you have a penis you can * only * be positive about female circumcision . 
   i 've never seen it any other way . 
  the same could be said for circumcised girls as well . 
   it 's not like i 'm missing something . 
  do n't worry half_man1 , it 's just buried deep in your soul . 
   like it 's the biggest threat to our european way of life i think it 's just another matter that can be easily regulated without much discussion . 
  a : `` we should ban circumcision ! '', 
  yes , it is surgical mutilation . 
  and thus it is performed only when it 's needed . 
  did your parents need to remove your foreskin ? 
  pyramids are not intact btw .
