  their whole outer surface was covered and smooth . 
  of course column based structures will not last for millennia in a perfect condition . 
  it 's quite hard to preserve something intact after 2500 years . 
  i ca n't find proper pork gyros abroad for obvious reasons . 
  i spent a ton of time walking around as i always do as a tourist . 
  unless everything is unmarked and underground , we could hardly find any non touristy places to sit . 
  and no , eating at the local mall is not an option !, 
   the temple was near the beach the current beach is usually not the same as the beach 2500 years ago . 
  keep that in mind . 
  that webpage is the official government page so it 's as good as it gets . 
  the thing is that this area has n't been of big enough archaeological interest since the late 1800s . 
  are you talking about a temple near `` artemisio '' where the wello known naval fight took place ? 
  then you are looking for [ this ] ( http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/2/gh251.jsp?obj_id=11721 ) temple of \u0391\u03c1\u03c4\u03ad\u03bc\u03b9\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03b7\u03ce\u03b1\u03c2 . 
  also read [ this ] ( http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/3/gh351.jsp?obj_id=11702 ) . 
  there 's a ton to translate here ... pray that google translate does a good job !, 
  wroclaw is really picturesque but there 's not much to do !, 
  where do people eat other than the few tourist traps around the square ? 
  we actually know where that temple is . 
  there a ton of things that can happen in all those years ; some times local just use the materials for their buildings , other times its conquerors or looters , some times it 's just war . 
  i recently experienced the latter near nafplio , greece at the ancient asini site whose parts were used to fortify the area by italians in ww2 . 
  seeing pics from the 30s where you can clearly see houses etc in an area that is now almost completely leveled . 
  you forgot the gtfo part . 
   the borders of the republic of macedonia can only be changed in accordance with the constitution and on the principle of free will , as well as in accordance with generally accepted international norms . 
  phew !, 
  for a second i forgot how this clause completely stopped wars in the past !,

  same with france and italy being above greece . 
  lol . 
  more like half of the time ... 
   there are monasteries in mount athos as a woman you can not enter the whole peninsula of athos ; it 's not just some monasteries . 
  we are southern europe , plus balkans !, 
  ~ 105k out of 132k km ^ 2 of greece are on the peninsula itself . 
  the islands are of course not included . 
  it depends on your definition of balkans . 
  geographically , we definitely are on the balkan peninsula . 
   f + + , would not lend money again . 
  do n't worry , it 's never fyrom lending to greece , it 's always greece investing in fyrom . 
  even though i totally agree with you about fyrom , i do n't think this is the proper place and time to shitpost about this . 
  this is out of topic , but as a proud balkan guy from greece , having no section devoted to my country in a website called `` balkan insights '' is ridiculous . 
   the greek cypriot administration is effectively at war with the north and whose fault is that ? 
  maybe it has something to do with another country invading their country ? 
  is this the point where someone mentions armenians and how they sort of started `` disappearing '' ? 
  what is interesting is that phillip , duke of edinburgh was born in corfu , greece into the greek and danish royal families and his uncle was the king of greece while his father fought with greece at the greco-turkish war of the era . 
   it 's a slavic name . 
  try the opposite . 
  \u1f21\u03b3\u03ad\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 = i lead has been in use in ancient greece and it has a [ nice ] ( http://www.palaeolexicon.com/word/show/19965 ) proto-indo-european root . 
  i believe the greek of homer was far earlier than slavic , right ? 
   `` honeymilk '' ( meligalas ) [ triggered !!, 
  ! / \u03c3 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/meligalas ), 
   and ban travel to turkey for tourists a ban does n't work as / u/yungfambruhgini said . 
  a stern warning about possible problems and a reminder about terrorists attacks in turkey can definitely work though . 
  i 've personally always done that ; nonetheless , people that live in a touristic area must also be able to speak english * if * they are in the tourism business . 
  i had problems in spain in the past in the airport of all places !, 
  learn hrvatski to visit croatia and learn greek to visit my country . 
  greek redditor here , they are not getting through the evros region no matter what . 
  the whole area over there is prepared for anything like that ever happening . 
  on the other hand , if turkey wants to march into europe , they 'd try to avoid the mountains that separate greece from the rest of the balcans so they 'd circumvent greece and just venture into bulgaria going full force . 
  also , by the time they start amassing troops for such a venture , the rest if europe and nato would already know this and be prepared . 
  suddenly it is not only bulgaria and greece over there ; you have aircraft carriers in the aegean , friendly planes on greek airports and so on . 
   greece ca n't fight turkey at all - could n't afford more than a week of fighting you 'd be surprised at what kind of equipment we have over here ... 
  drive towards greece ; the only disc you see is the sun . 
  a relevant username , if i had it myself !, 
  can i be excused since this is a greek word and in greek it 's ** \u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba ** \u03ac ? 
   who cry ** evritiem ** they see ~ ~ a painted face ~ ~ dyslectic fingers, 
  i love churches because it shows what can current technology do when you have ~ ~ huge ~ ~ obscene amounts of money disposable .

  they are too busy counting their money !, 
  that type of unique blonde / blue eyed combination i have in mind is distinctively albanian from what i know ; greeks are mostly dark haired . 
  you must be right about the northern thingy !, 
  maybe they are closer to ancient illyrians than the average mediterranean !, 
   i can tell most albanians by their face but there are other albanians that are indistinguishable from greeks . 
  exactly that . 
  the face characteristics are quite unique !, 
  and the more they interbreed ( hate that word ! ), 
  with greeks the more we will be indistinguishable from each other over here and the lines will become blurrier . 
  in general , everybody on the east mediterranean area is close enough with each other . 
  still , the average albanian is very easily distinguished from the average greek at the moment ; especially the blonde , stocky , blue eyed type . 
  yes , i am . 
  ok you are obviously trolling .

   'd take greece over spain any day that 's music to my ears man . 
  still , i like spain !, 
  a happy customer is what we always seek !, 
   pretty shameful indeed !, 
  still corfu has amazing beaches as well !, 
   best in greece i 've heard beaches at skiathos are great , but greece is filled with fantastic beaches on islands * and * on the mainland as well which is often neglected . 
  enjoyt the [ island ] ( http://skiathosisland.com/uploads/skiathos_lalaria_beach2.jpg ) man !, 
  we liked the british a lot during the occupation . 
  my grandparents had always great things to say about them and even kept contact with them after the war !, 
  no , and yes at the same time . 
  even today greece is sort of divided between the left and right wing . 
  still , we had [ a nice little civil war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_civil_war ) after the liberation when the british started supporting the government ( that partly employed nazi collaborators ! ), 
  against the very same communist rebels that they were working with during the occupation . 
  in that way , no , the propaganda was n't effective .
