  for kassiani i like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4v2kvmoeb4 ) rendition of the traditional kassiani hymn . 
  * every * island in greece will be emptier in september . 
  even a place like mykonos will be ok in early june or late september . 
  i went to amorgos a few years ago and it was quite calm even in august ; unfortunately the tourism seems to slowly shift from `` alternative '' to a more `` posh '' variant , but it 's still perfectly fine imho . 
  milos is not ff the beaten path but it 's a prefect destination for couples ; the beaches there are really [ unique ] ( http://www.touristorama.com/assets/images/articles_en/sarakiniko-beach-milos/sarakiniko-beach-milos.jpg ) cause of the old volcanic activity . 
  ikaria is an `` alternative '' destination where you will find tons of relaxed hippies . 
  it will be less crowded than most islands definitely . 
  personally i love [ samothraki ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-op864erj6zo/uh36mjvxqri/aaaaaaaadcu/qmxc0basq50/s1600/534871_131617743695386_614020069_n.jpg ) , but it 's a bit hard to reach unless you are in the balkans like bulgaria or romania . 
  tons of relaxed hippies as well but the nature there is amazing ; empty beaches , an amazing river for some day-long hiking and swimming in natural ponds and under [ waterfalls ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/dc/de/4c/dcde4c7314bed8e88057d3f62b781280--greek-islands-travel-destinations.jpg ) and an interesting ancient history as well . 
  i also loved [ naxos ] ( http://www.naxos-island-greece.com/img/pics/pic-kastraki-1.jpg ) , a huge island that even though it has thousands of tourists , its beaches are so big that you can be left completely alone !, 
  at worst , if you choose a big island like crete , lesvos , kefalonia , corfu , rhodes etc you always have a mix of populated and calm / secluded areas . 
  amorgos is an [ amazing ] ( http://www.mysteriousgreece.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/amorgos.jpg ) [ little ] ( http://amorgos.gr/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/mouros-beach-amorgos1.jpg ) [ island ] ( http://whereintheworldisparadise.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/dsc_0675.jpg ) to visit !, 
  except that it 's not about medical marijuana but about medicine ( as in pills ) that contain the active ingredients . 
  sort of ... 
  when a situation ( or place ) is messed up , disorganised etc we call it a '' \u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf '' ; a brothel . 
  in the past one common way to describe our parliament was that it was a '' \u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf '' and during the big demonstrations between the late 00s up to 2015 , a common slogan was : '' \u039d\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b5\u03af \u03bd\u03b1 \u03ba\u03ac\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf \u03b7 \u03b2\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03ae '' , that is basically a wish so that the brothel parliament burns down .

  add to that list [ the largest known dome for over a thousand years ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treasury_of_atreus ) .

  ( i am great at emulating pronunciations , i already knew this ! ), 
  thanks pal !, 
   gleichbehandlungsgesetz seriously , if i could read this , i 'd report myself at the police asap !, 
  using usain bolt and running as an example , i 'd say that iaf is getting a fine because of instead of letting runners run as fast as they can , they always give the gold medal to a swiss athlete they like and that does the 100m in 12 seconds , while they make usain bolt and others wear a fatsuit that weighs 30 kilos during the race . 
  hey neighbor , i was n't `` serious '' about my comment above . 
  i am glad that it 's been kept as a museum tbh but those ridiculous calls for agia sophia to be converted back into a mosque irk me a lot . 
  i wonder what was given in return . 
  this game needs a ton of anti-aliasing ; at least msaa x4 . 
  do they also support building modern nuclear plants to phase out the old ones ? 
  i personally love rocky beaches pal !, 
  it 's just that the thing that makes santorini amazing in general , the volcano and the caldera , is what makes its beaches quite average compared to the rest of greece . 
  i was sarcastic . 
  of course they 'd never allow it !, 
  maybe it should be converted to a christian church instead as it was originally intended . 
  the beaches are shit compared to other islands / mainland but far better than anything the northern europe has to offer . 
   i am not ~ ~ rich ~ ~ poor enough to ~ ~ retire ~ ~ live in the mediterranean, 
  i see you know your way around greece man !, 
  well , then athens is definitely * not * the only capital . 
  for example the one you linked below in talinn is also not purpose built . 
   without an official mosque . 
  you meant without a purpose built mosque . 
  there are three or so official mosques that are fully registered , other than the dozens of unofficial ones . 
   thats why we have white skin that 's why us southerns are olive skinned . 
  it 's not just because we consume tons of olive oil !, 
   leaked audio of an alleged telephone conversation between defense minister panos kammenos and makis yiannousakis the leaked audio was * not * between the defense minister and the other guy , it was two other people discussing between them and involving the minister . 
  dark side , they pay taxes no matter what but they get no state benefits . 
  sure , we can wait till the 2040s until our gov can make our port great again , or we can sell a huge stake at them for hundreds of millions bringing in around 1000 jobs . 
  guess what happened . 
   but they get a lot more of it in a decade . 
  it 's still far better than selling the state run lottery for peanuts to private investors . 
  if i recall correctly , they were supposed to make their money back in less than two years and just generate insane amounts of profit after that . 
  we are the land of opportunity right now if you can curb the bureaucracy and regulations . 
  we can skip glossing over those abuses , and then europe can throw us the few billion euros that chine invests in greece . 
  i laughed my ass off at that fake greek !, 
   fuckers have actual sunshine as well we do . 
  35 degrees in athens today . 
  i am now burnt . 
  i 'd say an app on your phone that you open and change your choice whenever you want . 
  this is definitely not going to be abused at all !, 
   atm i have 500minutes of calls to any network , unlimited texts , 500mb of internet for 9.5 $ a month that 's cheap . 
  in greece , there are no 10 euro / month contracts . 
  prices are almost triple than yours . 
  read up if belgium has such a system in place . 
  still , this would be via your representatives in the parliament that may chose to ignore their constituents if they are loyal to the party . 
   low voter turnout 72 % turnout is not low . 
  well , you sure do n't have democracy then because you ca n't change the vote on your elections unless new elections are called . 
   if they changed their mind regarding it , we should listen to them . 
  how would you know if they changed their mind ? 
  do a referendum every month ? 
   500 extra free minutes , 500 extra mb internet , free spotify , and no roaming charges within the european union ! '', 
  for +1.5 $ i 'll take this scheme off your hands mate !, 
  let neighboring countries go fully renewable , then sell them your power . 
   is it a ` rustbelt-like ' situation ? 
  not at all . 
  we have tons of renewables because of heavy subsidising in the past . 
  the first paragraph is ridiculous ; you ca n't put putin and may / macron in the same sentence . 
  the second one is correct though . 
  people `` forgive '' the politicians they like . 
   macron now faces the issue of how to bring france out of the state of emergency , which was imposed after the paris attacks and has been extended several times . 
  it is expected to be extended one more time , until november , ** while the government prepares to transfer elements of the special police powers into permanent law . 
  **  ** the state of emergency allows police to conduct house raids and searches without a warrant or judicial oversight , including at night , and gives extra powers to officials to place people under house arrest outside the normal judicial process and to close places of worship . 
  it also allows for restrictions on large gatherings . 
  ** if may was contemplating coding any of the above into law , the article would have a totally condemning tone and / r/europe would be outraged . 
   sam panopoulos emigrated from greece to canada in 1954 at the age of 20 he was greek . 
  jus sanguinis and all . 
  greeks invent the best things : democracy , hawaiian pizza , anal sex ... 
  greeks have been calling it czechia ( \u03a4\u03c3\u03b5\u03c7\u03af\u03b1 ) for ages . 
  i disagree ; it is irrelevant to what i commented on . 
  your insight is important for other threads in this discussion though . 
  again , this is irrelevant to what i wrote above since i provided no opinion on what she said . 
  it 's uk elections time and people do n't enjoy simple facts stated in their circlejerk . 
  i propose another headline update :  may : i will rape your stupid human rights laws you tossers if it impedes new terror legislation . 
  i know how it works ; it is still terrible to do this . 
  guardian used to avoid all that crap in the past . 
  they could have done it like the other ( suspiciously ) similar title from skynews that did n't do the `` may : '' thingy . 
  as i said elsewhere , they should have changed the title to :  may : i will put an end to freedom of slavery if it impedes new terror legislation . 
  technically it 's as `` correct '' as the original one since it is essentially the same . 
  do you disagree that the title is editorialised to appear as if she said that exact quote ? 
  this is irrelevant to what i said . 
  sid she say the words `` rip up '' ?
