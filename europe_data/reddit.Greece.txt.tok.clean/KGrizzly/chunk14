  i expect clickbait headlines from independent , but not from guardian . 
   she said : `` but i can tell you a few of the things i mean by that : i mean longer prison sentences for people convicted of terrorist offences . 
  i mean making it easier for the authorities to deport foreign terror suspects to their own countries . 
   `` and i mean doing more to restrict the freedom and the movements of terrorist suspects when we have enough evidence to know they present a threat , but not enough evidence to prosecute them in full in court . 
   `` and if human rights laws stop us from doing it , ** we will change those laws ** so we can do it . '' and the title makes it look like she said the words `` rip up '' . 
  what the hell is wrong with those sensationalized titles ? 
  edit : nice . 
  downvoting the ** fact ** that the title is heavily editorialised . 
  the next headline should be : may : i will put an end to freedom of slavery if it impedes new terror legislation . 
  edit 2 : at +13 now from -7 . 
  i still wonder what exactly did i say that warranted downvoting other than not participating on the `` may is bad '' circlejerk . 
   `` and if our human rights laws stop us from doing it , we will change the laws so we can do it . 
  = theresa may says she will ** rip up ** human rights laws to fight terror sensationalised much ? 
   how high can rents go ? 
  as long as there are people willing to pay , that amount will rise . 
  lack of apartments + lack of new developments + `` popular '' cities = high prices . 
   what can we expect in the future ? 
  you can expect to commute from far away and forget about living near the city center . 
  lot 's of subs means that if turkey decides to start aggressive excursions in the aegean they can be torpedoed . 
   start a wat with a nuclear state turkey does n't have nuclear weapons of its own . 
   chinese state-controlled companies are buying up eu infastructure & businesses in strategic industries well they just bought a 20something percent stake of our electricity state grid . 
  so either acclaimed films like `` beasts of no nation '' and `` 13th '' are never shown there , or they all have to cut a small distribution deal to curb the rules . 
  this could work if all boats can be found beforehand in the n.africa-europe route . 
  it can not be done on the turkey-greece route since there are no international waters to turn them back to plus they capsize the boat in greek waters , so by law you have to save them . 
   but the content was laughable it 's several gigabytes of data ; the content 's seriousness and various gold nuggets of real dirt will be known in the next few months . 
   unless a significant number of people care , you just end up being pendantic and the whole thing gets forgotten . 
  after macron 's win , do you honestly believe that this hack will be forgotten ? 
   even if you could somehow argue this is illegal the local electoral authorities sure seem to think so ...  you really think this would be prosecuted ? 
  so , that would make it an improperly enforced law . 
  if prominent french le pen supporters started disseminating this information on social media , they might be prosecuted * after * macron wins . 
   it does n't prohibit individuals from talking about those things . 
  so what about [ this ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20170506-france-electoral-authorities-warn-spreading-leaked-macron-data-election-criminal-offence ) announcement from the french electoral authorities ? 
   `` the dissemination of such data , which has been fraudulently obtained and in all likelihood may have been mingled with false information , is liable to be classified as a criminal offence , '' the electoral commission said in a statement . 
   `` on the eve of the most important election for our institutions , the commission calls on everyone using the internet and social media ... not to spread this information , '' the statement said . 
  this one ? 
  it seems that it covers practically all kinds of political messaging , and having hollande being quoted as urging `` people to wait for investigations into the macron leaks to be completed . '', 
  that sounds opinionated to me . 
   `` starting from the night before polls open , it is illegal to publish or broadcast by all means of communication any message that may be categorised as electoral propaganda , '' france 's superior audiovisual council , or csa , said in a statement . 
   however , television stations in france are allowed to broadcast images of the candidates voting ( along with other citizens ) , provided all candidates in the election are included , and as long as no candidate transmits any message on camera . 
   the law also prohibits french media from publishing , broadcasting or commenting on any kind of electoral poll . 
  quotes from : http://www.france24.com/en/20170506-france-media-rules-prohibit-election-coverage-over-weekend-presidential-poll, 
  since hollande commented on saturday , did n't he break the relevant election law ? 
  hey , / r/greece would be the perfect place to ask . 
  there 's plenty of folks from thessaloniki , including students . 
   wikileaks as no legitimacy since they 've decided to gain leverage with their hacked information . 
  legitimacy is bound to the legitimacy of the information , not on the agenda . 
  the agenda is in the commenting of the information and you can dismiss all that quite easily while still looking at the raw data yourself . 
  we can all talk about how wikileaks has an agenda , but that does n't make any of their leaked data fake . 
  up to now , if wikileaks themselves publishes data that shows that candidate a sent this `` bad '' email to another political entity , you can rest assured that this email is true no matter what agenda they might have or not . 
  you can not dismiss the message because of the messenger . 
   since many documents might never even be verifiable . 
  that leaves a ton of influential documents that * are * verifiable . 
  you would just need a few proven fakes to cast doubt but nobody has been able to do that until now . 
   in my opinion , it would be way more sensible position to assume everything is fake until proved otherwise . 
  then i hope you assume this stance against ** anybody ** that gives you information ( websites , newspapers , the tv etc ) no matter how proper and unmistaken they were up to now . 
   when will your wife 's nudes be avaible ? 
  / s my wife 's nudes do not interest the public . 
  macron 's weird dealings or le pen 's loans from russia do interest the public though . 
   they do n't post necessarily fake documents but many documents they post are n't verifiable , so we ca n't say it is 100 % real either . 
  it would be perfectly easy for someone to show that documents published by wikileaks are fake . 
  until then , we can safely assume that whatever * they * leak is real . 
  now , no matter what agenda they might have , i welcome all kinds of leaks about anybody that might / will influence my future . 
   appreciate her contributions . 
  i am so triggered : slavic greece i loved that basque reference though !, 
  $ 524 is such a fair value !, 
  is this the usual thread using questionable statistics about how dumb people make bad choices and destroy the future of the redditors that all made the good choice since they are all so smart ? 
   ~ ~ smaller ~ ~ 0 chance of a terrorist attack, 
  transferring garbage in the university from outside is also a proper way to react to this ? 
  not allowing them to clean up if they wish to is also proper ? 
  not cleaning the toilets only while they leave the rest uncleaned ( this was proposed ) is also proper ? 
  btw , letting people clean the university is not strikebreaking since the students / faculty are not part of the strike . 
  imho , there is a fine line between supporting and defending your rights and creating problems for others because you demand that everything is done in your way . 
  17 million euros for cleaning / security per year is a lot . 
  what is the total uni 's budget ? 
  the fact is that a huge percentage of the university 's budget goes for outsourced cleaning services . 
  if i recall correctly there is a specific percentage of any university 's budget that is allowed to go to such outsourced services . 
  as it is usual , in greece laws like these are often trampled so now they intend to ( sort of ) follow the law . 
  that would mean that those cleaners will lose their jobs !, 
  there are many ways to react to this , but leaving the university in such a state and not allowing students / professors etc to clean them is not the way forward . 
  if they start looking closely right now at everyone that does that they will never gather any money since it will take a long time . 
  this is practically extortion in its good form . 
  hopefully those fuckers will just walk in and pay what they know they must . 
  this measure does n't only apply to farmers of course . 
  it applies to everyone in greece that declares an x amount of money while they have transferred via banks lots more money outside of the country . 
  i ca n't recall the precise numbers but just 1000 people should pay a few billions in taxes . 
  and of course you ca n't use this measure to capture the smarter people that flew their money to switzerland via their lear jets !, 
  it 's not really a warning . 
  it 's more of a `` come out and pay 45 % of the amount we know you hid before we come and check you out more * intimately * '' . 
  at least that 's the intention . 
  dude , the situation over here is bad . 
  go to your corner and cry all day long . 
  this is just a quick opinion of course since societies are quite complicated !, 
  young people are fed up with the situation they are in . 
  18-30 year olds have huge unemployment rates , 30-50 year olds pay huge taxes and need to take care of their families and such and the current system does n't allow them to do that . 
  plus they have only known governments by pasok and nd so they tend to avoid that choice . 
  younger people also tend to vote with hope in their mind but they also abstain more from the process !, 
  older people were very scared and in a big part voted with fear in their minds . 
  the despicable new democracy advertisement that the internet ridiculed and criticized must have been hugely successful with older people !, 
  `` omg , all my money will be soon gone , my children and grand-children will be poor and hungry , let 's not vote for syriza / kke and whoever else is unclear about our future in europe . '', 
  in my area which has more older people residing nd went from 15 % to 36 % within the last month !,
