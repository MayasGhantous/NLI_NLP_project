   what they had expected was that greece would slap down a proposal to the troika which did most of what they asked , included a restructure and further bailout and negotiations would start again . 
  that 's what is basically happening tomorrow . 
  people in both sides have been meeting up and weighing on their choices . 
  on the greek side , the pm met the other parties ' leaders and they sort of did a joint statement of `` unity '' . 
  the communist party did n't sign it and the golden dawn leader was n't invited at all . 
  feel free to pm if you want to ask anything . 
  wait what ? 
  ireland did n't have a national water utility up to now ? 
  3 days in athens is way more than enough . 
  do a daily cruise to local islands such as aigina , spetses and hudra or a daily bus excursion to nafplio , mykines and epidavros . 
  we voted `` no '' to the specific deflationary measures that were given to greece as a `` take it or leave it '' offer . 
  wtf happened with the water ? 
  do you have any detailed articles to link me to ? 
  it would be interesting to read more !, 
  27 referendums in total for exiting the eu . 
  each one costing an average of 35 million euros ( lowball estimate ) . 
  the bill would be just shy of a billion euros . 
  totally worth it !, 
  it can always get worse . 
  it could have been worse for croatia or even ukraine as the other user posted . 
  the whole point is that it could get better with specific measures including debt restructuring / relief . 
  i am not the one that claimed that it is the most extreme fiscal adjustment . 
   a little bit worse i would disagree on that part . 
  this is a huge discussion but 60 % unemployment for ages below 25 and 25 % + for the total population are not a little bit worse . 
  just by comparison i believe ukrainians had it better compared to regions ransacked by mongolians with genghis khan . 
  i am using an extreme example but you get my point !, 
  see my [ other answer ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3c4lo3/hello_fellow_europeans_i_am_writing_to_you_as_a/csspxee ) on this . 
  yugoslavia was dissolved then you had a war !, 
  of course it would be worse !, 
  i am now reading on your recent recession ; it was terrible for you guys !, 
  it 's just a detail . 
  the declaration of independence was on the 24th of august , 1991 and it was ratified by a referendum on the december of the same year . 
  my point being is that you can not compare the effects of dissolving a country into several other countries with a recession within a single country . 
  that 's the same reason that people do n't directly compare recessions in war torn countries other than just making figure comparisons . 
  this is not a dick measuring contest . 
  to be precise , in 1990 when the data begins , ukraine has n't still declared its independence . 
  plus this recession includes the dissolution of the ussr , something that was unprecedented . 
  technically this is the forming of a new country and this kind of gdp decrease is preset on all former ussr countries . 
  http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/images/2015/02/blogs/graphic-detail/20150221_gdc500.png true , it was * just * a 25 % gdp reduction in 5 years . 
  edit : why the downvotes ? 
  is giving out a chart by the economist so counter productive to discussion ? 
  so my only choice is bulgaria ? 
  for a guy with a greek username you sure know what to say in these situations . 
  one of our major public holidays is called `` day of \u03cc\u03c7\u03b9 '' . 
  the `` no day '' basicaly . 
  there 's a `` vote no '' gathering today and another `` vote yes '' gathering tomorrow in athens ' city centre . 
  alternatively follow as much media as possible and enjoy the mess ! . 
   so that people wo n't go and drain the banks in certain places , people are already lining up for atms withdrawing as much as they can . 
  the one who celebrates pays . 
  the problem with my country is if you can afford to do so !, 
  istanbul is great but  it 's the actual capital of greece does not compute, 
  with old refugees i meant albanians that are now either settled here or gone back to albania as well as afghans , pakistanis , kurds etc that have been working in greece for the better part of the late 90s and early 00s . 
  especially if they were from a village area ; life there can be much more fulfilling than most people realise . 
  i am glad your father spent his last years happy !, 
   littered the downvotes are due to your language man . 
  no they are not littered . 
  there are areas in athens where there are tons of old refugees that have spent years in athens , but basically the recent huge increase of refugees has n't impacted us as hard as you may think . 
  greece was just a hub in the last couple of years and the 50k or so immigrants that are trapped in camps here is very small compared to the older immigrants . 
  i ca n't find a source now but imagine that because of the crisis , in the last 5 or so years about 500k immigrants left greece to find their luck elsewhere or returned home . 
  i loved my time spent in britain ( no worries , i do n't confuse you with britain ! ), 
  but it is true that i missed the greek sun . 
   even that small junkie filled park in exarchia did not feel that unsafe night it must be because there are a billion cafes and bars filled with people all day ( and night ) long !, 
  this is / r/europe , they are not aware of the trope !, 
  brussels was a shock to me really , it has tons of cement everywhere ; the buildings are beautiful though !, 
  i loved how vienna was full of parks btw , having destroyed fortifications all around leaves a ton of space for green areas compared to athens and its reasons for being like that !, 
  less touristic ? 
  there will be busloads of tourists there at the site !, 
  corinth is a shitty city with some nice archaeological sites ; i 'd stay in nafplio , if i was you , and visit mykines , corinth and epidavros . 
  there are also tons of archaeological sites in northern greece closer to you . 
  samothraki and thassos for example have their share of archaeological sites and are really beautiful ; i personally could n't recommend samothraki enough !, 
  i 've spent a lot of time at that island !, 
  there 's also thessaloniki which has a very rich history as you well know and you can combine it with vergina and pella to see stuff from the ancient macedonian era . 
  a little bit to the south you can find the dion at pieria . 
  island wise you would probably love the island of dilos , 
  i 've seen better `` green '' wise and i 've seen worst . 
  you are close by mate , come over for a few days instead of just driving to the awesome northern greece !, 
   meh , i hope it does n't get better that way syriza ca n't take credit a and they do n't win another election . 
  thanks man !, 
  i love it when my fellow europeans wish us the best !, 
  well , it is as recognised as `` your '' being used instead of `` you 're '' is . 
  let the americans and british destroy their language while we foreigners do our best !, 
   but nationalism can also be dangerous , if it leads to believing that your nation is not only superior , but that all other nations are inferior . 
  spoken like the uncivilised inferior western-russian that you are . 
   mute point --  moot point http://blog.dictionary.com/moot-point-vs-mute-point/ sorry for being the grammar nazi here but compared to the rest of your fantastic english this jumped out to me . 
  it 's not like `` facts '' are factual bro !, 
  yeah , i was going to do my erasmus in finland but all places were `` filled '' so i went to my second choice ... 
  it reminds of of areas * i 've visited * and i do n't recall bilbao having any of those peppers hanging around . 
  do espelette peppers grow in the spanish side ? 
  btw , no such thing as unified basque `` country '' at this moment but you know this better than me . 
  the fact that you point out the `` not france '' part is funny but expected according to your flair . 
  just a quick observation . 
  the island that you see there is the `` new '' isalnd that was created from the large explosion ~ 4k years ago after the largest part of the isalnd was destroyed and a huge caldera was created !, 
  check it [ here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/santorini_landsat.jpg ) ; yes , that really looks like a crater because it basically is a crater . 
  this reminds me the basque regions in france !, 
  same in my area in peloponese . 
  afghans , pakistanis and kurds have returned home or moved to another country . 
  albanians have either returned or they have settled in perfectly and asians reside around the cities with their commerce and do n't do much of agricultural works . 
  ok . their population decreased significantly during the crisis ; in several areas there are not even enough workers for agricultural work !, 
   there are large numbers of immigrants all over greece . 
  are you talking about the last batch of immigrants that have been arriving for the last year or so ?
