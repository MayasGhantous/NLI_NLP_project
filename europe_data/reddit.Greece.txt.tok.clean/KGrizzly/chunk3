  or the general immigrants that have been staying here for ages and have been reduced by almost half a million due to the crisis since 2009 or so ? 
   what i 'm not sure is why people with the attitude of patricians think that 's a bad thing , or they 'll somehow suffer for it . 
  assuming that you talk about probable tourists , i completely agree . 
  no 2 is already addressed and pulled to either side by government officials * and * some unknown people that constantly spread rumors ( actually just happened again ) that the borders are * now * open . 
  no 3 is more or less irrelevant to greece since the greek government ca n't broadcast messages into migrant camps in turkey to stop them from coming . 
  no 4 and 5 , as / u/mfukar said , is a ridiculous logical jump . 
  no 6 is funny since the whole tourism industry is not collapsing as it seems . 
  greece is heading to another record year as far as tourism is concerned . 
  unless you are at kos , lesvos , chios or idomeni you wo n't even see any immigrants . 
  your last sentence is ridiculous , the fact that something happened using violence in the past does n't mean that we should repeat it . 
  that 's the whole point of moving forward as a civilization instead of moving backwards . 
  your whole series of `` logical '' points could be used with slight modifications to address everything with violence . 
   this needed to be done eu-wide . 
  the same eu that can not even properly condone or condemn openly the closing of the borders and let other countries do their job for them . 
  well , they already started to move the pireaus immigrants around but 5k people are not an easy amount of people to move . 
  all this rush for a deal with urkey was to have it before the real good weather begins and 3k new immigrants per day arrive to the shores . 
  trust me , no one can build 3k new places in an organised camp that everyone protests against . 
   and then send back to where they came from . 
  who told you that the other country will receive them ? 
  it 's not like you will drop them with a parachute !, 
   offering a legal path to apply for asylum . 
  up to last month or so , everyone along with the rest of the eu encouraged them to get in and apply at their country of preference . 
  there is a legal path you know but you do n't sound like you 'd like 50k people applying for asylum in greece because that would mean that we 'd have to feed them and house them until they get accepted or rejected . 
   more children have died since the `` greece has no borders/hey everyone , get in here/we 'll send jihadists to europe if the imf and eu do n't bend over '' policy was adopted . 
  you mean to tell me that more deaths happened when the traffic was bigger ? 
  no shit sherlock !, 
  yeah sure , i bet that refugees learned that greece has open borders and suddenly started to get here ; please tell me that you are not one of those `` it is syriza 's fault for the whole immigration situation !, 
   no , not all of it is . 
  nor did i ever state that . 
   they should never have been allowed to gather like this . 
  where would you put them ? 
  idomeni was the natural point like kalais in france since it was the last stop before entering fyrom and pireaus is the first place where they landed from the islands . 
  the vast majority of the rest are in camps . 
  which ones ? 
  the fyrom ones ? 
  because you can absolutely not secure greek-turkish water borders . 
  it is everyone 's responsibility to know what kind of suggestions or actions are realistic or not . 
  saying : `` all of them should be jailed '' is not realistic because we do n't even have enough jails . 
  saying that a water border can be impenetrable is also unrealistic . 
  the refugee crisis is unprecedented in the last 40 years . 
  in the past these issues were dealt with proper old-school violence of the `` so-what-if-a-child-dies '' variety ; now this is plain impossible . 
  btw , i bet that the whole financial situation of greece is tsipras ' fault !, 
  i gave you this scenario because you said that they are incompetent . 
  everyone can say that they 'd do things better but they never define anything concrete and realistic . 
   oh and i would n't be distributing `` we love you but please leave our main port '' leaflets . 
  you are the government !, 
  you do n't beg , you act . 
  so you get the riot police to the port and you load them in buses ? 
  yeah sure , because this will do wonders for our image ; the rest of the world and the eu has certain `` expectations '' of civility from greece while they do n't seem to have the same when turkey and fyrom do the same . 
   nor would i allow the trade routes to be blocked to this extent . 
  you are talking about the country that has had tractors blocking the routes for ages every few years when there is a strike . 
  sure , i bet that you would `` stop it '' somehow . 
  as for ngos , there have been several cases of foreigners coming in every day from neighboring countries and distributing rumors etc. 
  i 'd love too the flak that the greek government would catch if it started arresting foreign eu nationals . 
  please enlighten the rest of us greeks what you would do realistically if you were the government . 
  why should greek police stop them if they wan na leave ? 
  as many people said before : where is the turkish police to stop the migrants from crossing to greece ? 
  it means that on average men marry women younger than them in europe . 
  / u/costantine has probably never seen a [ commieblock ] ( http://www.constructionphotography.com/imagethumbs/a052-00976/3/a052-00976_communist_era_flats_bratislava_slovakia.jpg ) ; what they mean is ugly cement multi-storey buildings . 
  still an amazing place ; have n't been there forever . 
  pelio is so awesome for winter or summer vacations !, 
  probably [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_revolution ) is why . 
  it 's the same year after all !, 
  hope it has n't turned into the `` modern '' kind of greek village . 
  the thisio and parthenon one is clearly a case of copy-paste !, 
  hahahahaha !, 
  til !, 
  as a greek ( that is bundled with the ottoman empire here ) i can attest to the fact that i am a tender but inconsistent , treacherous and sneaky young devil that wears feminine clothes and is impotent . 
  i am also the official reddit mascot since i mostly resemble a cat !, 
  awesome !, 
  that 's [ one fine looking g ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tzea2kb.jpg ) !, 
  french : syphilis and cheating . 
  good stuff . 
   it is funny to see how turkey was already considered europe in those days . 
  let 's just say that they had conquered [ a fairly large part ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yzv2rus.gif ) of it up to that point . 
  not how it happens in greece . 
  you enter , you pay , you do the deed and that 's it . 
  btw , half of the local prostitute population are from your side of the world . 
  just like it happens in the us , person b will just find an envelope with money in the bed stand ; how lucky are they !, 
  for me austria is [ steyr trucks ] ( http://military-vehicle-photos.com.s3.amazonaws.com/535.jpg ) and redbull . 
  greece : [ \u03a6\u03b1\u03b3\u03b5 ] ( http://greece.fage.eu/sites/all/themes/global_fage/images/share_greece_logo.png ) yogurt . 
  it should be [ this ] ( http://www.instantcoffeebrands.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/nescafe-greek-instant-coffee.jpg ) marvelous creation though !, 
  cyprus is basically a colony , we own the copyrights and after all we will take them with us when we leave the eu . 
  if they do n't come , we will invade and worst case scenario we 'll install a puppet state ... oh wait . 
  this reminds me of something . 
  in greece uht is just 2 % of the market while fresh milk takes about 45 % and high ( that lasts longer ) takes another 45-50 % . 
  the rest is sour milk ( \u03be\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1 ) . 
  well , if we leave the euro and the eu we would like you to change that name ; it is a greek word and it infringes on our copyrights . 
  sure , we will do our best to fall in line with the rest . 
  you did n't set a country tag friend . 
  no one recognizes them aside from turkey . 
  so no one accepts them except that it is what it is !, 
  where was the outrage when they played it back in 2015 in thessaloniki ? 
  nowhere . 
  it was planned to play in epidavros but it wo n't happen now , will it ? 
  op is clearly a shill for montenegro 's board of tourism and i can not complain !, 
  this looks amazing !, 
  except that they are french and they play a piece by a belgian . 
  so what is the point of the distinction between sung and non-sung verses ? 
  sure , sure , neukoln in berlin is a no-go zone ...
