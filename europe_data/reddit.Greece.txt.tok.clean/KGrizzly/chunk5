  but absolutely no monetary compensation , working permit and no freedom of movement outside the refugee camps . 
  good luck building cities that can house and secure 70-100 thousand new migrants per month . 
  the idea is not wrong but its realistically unenforcable . 
  also good luck convincing turkey to do that wok for eu . 
  it must be greece 's fault that this happened ... 
  what he stupidly means is build a 50k large city to house everyone . 
  of course this will fill up in 10 days but then he will sya that the `` hotspot '' needs to be able to house 100k people . 
  so they want more time flexibility for their workers , more time spent working per year , eliminate saturday working bonuses and link the wage increase to productivity . 
  lol . 
  as a comment says below :  the next thing will be ... 
  paying for going to work ... 
  since greece is absent from this list , i would like to note that wikipedia lists us as 3rd in the world with 23.4 kg / capita / year ( 2011 ) . 
  other [ sources ] ( http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/annual-cheese-consumption-by-country.html ) place is as no !, 
  in the world in 2009 . 
  yes we love our feta . 
  yes , but is our england the absolute very best ? 
  you keep repeating this as the the answer to life the universe and everything when everyone knows the answer is 42 . 
  sure i consider myself schooled my dear sir . 
  from now on i will refer to fyrom as `` tfyrom '' . 
  ps : there 's no good will on this specific matter from me . 
  appropriating another country 's culture and history is plain wrong . 
  just did . 
  it might have different contents for us depending on who it wants to `` please '' . 
  people 's republic of china . 
  taiwan is taiwan . 
  but that 's just my opinion and how everyone in greece knows it . 
  using the official un name is derogatory ? 
  if by macedonia you refer to fyrom then do as you wish . 
   you ca n't just put a different name on it cause you feel like it . 
  that 's the exact problem . 
  could you tomorrow morning start calling turkey as `` greece '' ? 
  then repeat it for about 30 years until people start accepting it while the * real * greece denies it . 
  and then you start saying that it is obvious that ancient greeks were from * your * greece ... read the links i provided please . 
  former yugoslav republic of macedonia enjoy reading [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonia_naming_dispute ) !, 
  also , the [ official greek stance ] ( http://www.mfa.gr/en/fyrom-name-issue/ ) on the matter . 
  because my main geopolitics information comes from the name of a subreddit . 
  no he meant fyrom . 
  aaaah , the usual `` throw them off to another poor country '' answer . 
  i have an idea !, 
  we could throw them in australia . 
  tons of free space , great weather , and it 's not like australia will shoot them when this is done by plane . 
  i have a better idea : we could welcome everyone in greece and then throw them with parachutes on other countries . 
  what can they do , shoot them down ? 
  unless you give them monetary help . 
   and naturally they will bargain for far more than the few agreed billions . 
  i propose we solve it by killing that generation . 
  if that 's the way to solve it so be it . 
  the world is n't fair . 
  these are the current constraints . 
  so you 'd hit with water cannons a boat that has children in ? 
  and one nice evening while doing so the boat will sink and turkey will be slow to respond to save them and so greece has just pushed 30 people to their deaths . 
  cue in the international rage and condemnations . 
  you ca n't tow them to another country 's waters because you can not enter those waters with your own boats . 
  you can not push them back because your boat needs to sit on a safe distance from the border line ; it 's not like you can anchor yourself right next to the line . 
  let 's not talk about the fact that there are hundreds of kms of water borders btw !, 
  could i have a source on the voluntary part please ? 
  it 's a joke because country x announces that they will resettle 30k immigrants and then they proceed to resettle 100 in a year while they expect greece to rescue , detain , register , house and feed 5k new immigrants per day . 
  please explain how you 'd use `` force '' to an inflated boat with 50 people in that tries to enter your territorial waters . 
  constraints : you have to do it humanely , you can not enter turkish waters , you must save them if they capsize in your waters , you can not push them back in turkish waters , there are no international waters inbetween . 
   and resettle the refugees among schengen members . 
  unfortunately this is the current running * joke * in the eu . 
  you pay an entrance fee with a drink , or just get a drink inside for about 10 euros . 
  you sit in a booth or a table . 
  girls start pouring in and talk to you . 
  there are two main options : 1 ) get her a drink for about 20 euros . 
  she will sit with you for some time to talk / flirt and then you will get 5 minute dance with her . 
  2 ) get a dance directly . 
  the price is about 10-15 euros and it lasts about 5 minutes . 
  there is no direct tipping on the live show stage and no tipping directly to the girl ; you pay an employee of the strip club . 
  you are allowed to touch the girls freely even before you 've purchased something as long as she sits with you at that moment . 
  during the dance the stripper will remove everything but her panties ; they will only remove them if you get an upper tier purchase of a `` special dance '' . 
  that costs about 50 euros , it lasts far longer and you may get extras like a handjob or a blowjob depending on the girl . 
  edit : touching the girl in the genital area is a no-no . 
  they will go through another less secure point . 
  depends on the country . 
  i can talk about greece but i doubt it 's my country you are asking for . 
   australia has about 20,000 for comparison , that is just a week 's amount of refugees entering greece . 
  the definition of rekt . 
  with a nominal gdp of about 240 billions per year in heavy recession and contraction you 'd get quite a bargain for 500 bil for the whole country . 
  it 's 500 billion euros please . 
  we are natural born pessimists . 
  do n't you know ? 
  now-eu citizens are roughly 4 times as likely to be pedophiles compared to the average austrian . 
  \u039a\u03bf\u03c4\u03c3\u03ac\u03bd\u03b9 is also a word for that , but \u03bc\u03af\u03c3\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 is still widely used . 
  ok , you just discovered with your hi-tech drones one boat in greek seas . 
  what do you do with it ? 
  you ca n't turn it around like australia did because there 's no international waters to get them to . 
  turkey wo n't take them back unless you convince them with a few extra billions . 
  and do you honestly believe that smugglers are riding those boats ? 
  they are not stupid you know , so no , you ca n't arrest smugglers in foreign territories . 
  turkey can , with more billions . 
  is there a local word in crete for that ? 
  it clearly has to do with the fact that tree trunks look like [ greek pasta ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vhcf5wu.jpg ) . 
  in all seriousness , '' \u03bc\u03af\u03c3\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 '' is still widely used in modern greek . 
  pretending , sure . 
  you still have n't given a single possible solution than a generic `` stop the flow '' response . 
  you are so ignorant that you do n't even know where the vast majority of immigrants are coming from ; guess what , it 's not `` africa '' . 
  sure , in case of emergencies we could ship them directly to hungary . 
  violence = killing them as i said , you can not tow them to turkey . 
   even ancient greece could protect its shores from maritime invaders .
