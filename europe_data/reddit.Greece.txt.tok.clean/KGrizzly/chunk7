  spacex just landed their full size demonstrator i believe . 
   a scale model of that vehicle has been tested and now is waiting for investors . 
   `` adeline , like the space plane , has been financed so far by internal airbus funds , with a total funding of no more than 5 million euros ( $ 16.5 million ) . 
  it will need substantial government support if it is to be available by 2025 , as airbus hopes . '', 
  it could be an awesome technology but unless big money is spent , there wo n't be progress . 
  it 's always spanish for us greeks . 
  and i absolutely do n't have a clue why . 
  maybe it 's the thetas , the quick pace of speaking and the general `` loudness '' that we tend to exhibit . 
  til !, 
  that 's an interesting fact !, 
  why would they keep that down ; they 'd get a good employee while doing / repaying a favor which is a fantastic proposition . 
  it 's the same everywhere in my experience but just far worse in some countries ( including mine ) . 
  so if you have a friend who is recruiting in an industry you are applying to in the us , do n't you think that this friend of yours will help your cv get more attention ? 
  it 's always about connections . 
  always has and always will be . 
  you accidentally many words . 
   you would n't believe how common nepotism is ~ ~ here ~ ~ everywhere . 
  there i fixed it for you . 
  having connections is not nepotism btw ; hiring your nefew when he is useless is nepotism . 
  creating a job for your cousin is nepotism . 
  a local theonion site ? 
  it would help if you had labeled your pic . 
  now if only this table was labeled you could show us your point . 
  we are still the undisputed champions of unemployment !, 
  spain you suuuuck !, 
  greece since we are the most powerful in unemployment . 
  we are the undisputed eu unemployment champions !, 
  i am so proud !, 
  if they could safely `` magically '' return back to their beach / port of origin no one would complain . 
  ps : lose-lose , 
   you only have to not allow them going forward easier said than done . 
  this imaginary line in the water signifies where turkish waters end and where greek waters begin . 
  a boat that `` sinks '' one meter in the water is your responsibility to rescue . 
  the problem is not the international outcry which is perfectly warranted if people get killed in the process due to mishandling ; the problem is that there is no direct way of stopping hundreds of thousand immigrants that wish to enter via sea . 
  this * exception * is the rule . 
  guess where most migrants and especially syrians come through ? 
  the boats that arrive in greece from turkey have no trafficers on board . 
  traffickers assign someone to steer the boat towards the lights . 
  how do you think the traffickers return back ? 
  via the boat that is quickly raided by locals to steal the engine ? 
  that is some a grade sarcasm !, 
   should have sent them back to the shore they came from , sank the boats and shot ( yes shot ) the traffickers while on the ocean . 
  so you would turn back the boat using some kind of police / army boat then enter foreign waters with your boat which is sort of a problem as you know . 
  do you honestly think that traffickers are on the boats so that you can shoot them ? 
  they are not that stupid . 
  finally what would you do with a sinking boat in your country 's waters ? 
  please stop being reasonable !, 
  do n't offer facts !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ love ^ ^ ^ ^ vienna, 
  technically , he was exonerated from what i recall . 
  this is not what we were discussing . 
  also , the fact that they did n't comply in 2016 , does n't mean that the new rules of 2017 can not change . 
  out of the old tv channels , mega , alpha , star and epsilon did n't get a licence . 
  four more spots means that they will * all * take a licence as long as no other new competitor enters . 
  still i 'd love to see how a total ad revenue of 200million can sustain 8 channels that spend 50mil a year ... 
  why the caps ? 
  i do n't mention anything about legality or not of the auction ? 
  an auction is performed on specific assumptions . 
  the 4th licence auction went really high because it was supposed to be the last one compared to the first one where bids were lower . 
  if in a few months nd wins the elections and says that we will add another 4 spots , thus removing scarcity , the prices will be far different . 
  and this will indeed by unfair to the current owners . 
  if new liscences are issued then they have to be priced at around the same level of the current ones were auctioned yesterday * or * the current owners will be mad that they paid all that money for nothing . 
  they already complained that the first one was auctionec cheaply compared to the later ones !, 
  this is the case even if syriza decides to issue new ones in a couple of years . 
  i think that their most vital option is to attack the government as much as possible in the next 3 months so that elections happen asap . 
  this way new democracy * might * cancel the auction . 
  they do n't even sell clothes ; that map is stupid . 
  inb4 someone mentions athens !, 
  and after visiting the crowdless malta , you can visit santorini in greece in august . 
  there 's going to be virtually no tourists !, 
   it isnt like these guys were liberators although i agree with you on that , i believe it 's funny to think that `` liberators '' is what all of this subreddit would call them if the coup originally succeeded . 
  those kind of characterizations always stick post hoc . 
   at times like these , i 'm glad to live in ~ ~ eastern europe ~ ~ greece . 
  you spelled gidotyri wrong . 
  may we exchange places ? 
  i love polish girls !, 
  one friend had a very desirable set of skills and his company just did everything for him . 
  another friend is on a working visa in canada at the moment . 
  why could n't putin finish the proposals earlier ? 
  germany , uk , holland , us , france , norway , italy and canada . 
  here in greece we * really * know our eu stuff . 
  this figure is by no means extreme ; about 50 % of my well educated friends have emigrated abroad . 
  they were distributed via a draw . 
  the situation there is far from ideal but it 's ridiculous to call the olympic village unused . 
  the olympic village houses 2,600 families for more than a decade . 
  it 's not abandoned in the way that most people think of it . 
  enjoy greece !, 
  can i swim in there without dying ? 
  ( i still hate myself for visiting belfast and not visiting the causeway ), 
  kefalonia is amazing ; i 've spent a lot of time there . 
  as requested : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4qr8b9/kefalonia_island_greece_in_4k/, 
  after a good meal that involves meat , you always need to get a nap . 
  when the whole western world found out about eating cooked meat , greeks already had cholesterol . 
  ... said the mighty remnant of an empire . 
  in czech republic , `` ne '' means no . 
  in greece , `` ne '' means yes . 
  i just had a deja-vu moment with your comment . 
  weird !, 
   this contradicts the fact that the americans are on average wealthier than the europeans . 
  http://money.cnn.com/2014/06/11/news/economy/middle-class-wealth/ i have 1 euro , you have 5 euros. , the billionaire in london has 1 billion euros .
