  on average we have about 333 million each . 
  so much richness . 
  edit : it 's even funnier that according to credit swisse , median wealth in my country greece is higher than the us . 
  was expecting to see some gifs . 
  was disappointed . 
  is this a `` who killed more people ? 
  let 's post pictures of dead people . '', 
  thread ? 
  because armenians suffered a fully recognized genocide so ...  armenians are barbraic people who have killed innocent people in past . 
  also , do n't say this stupid stuff here . 
  all `` people '' have their past . 
  is your people 's history completely void of any violent incidents ? 
  literally any area that you point on the map has something nice to see . 
  http://www.visitgreece.gr/en/mainland i love the peloponnese . 
  each of its prefecture has amazing beaches , night life as well as archaeological stuff to see . 
  halkidiki is amazing as well as far as beaches are concerned . 
  at pelion you can go skiing in winter and swim at fantastric beaches in summer . 
  the old villages are also really pretty . 
  the south west is amazing . 
  bayonne , pau , biarritz etc are fantastic . 
  avoid the whole of greece in august ; our weather is amazing from mid-june to late september for swimming . 
  in august you will just join the hordes of other tourists unless you visit a less well known place . 
  on the contrary , try visiting mainland greece and not just the islands . 
  we have way too many places that get mostly unnoticed since everyone concentrates on mykonos , santorini , rhodes etc. 
  greeks [ got you covered ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/bull-leaping.jpg ) mate !, 
  you should come over to greece and witness the old women shouting at each other during embarking / disembarking in the metro . 
  it 's a staple of greek democracy . 
  some of those definitely apply to the uk !, 
  especially [ this ] ( http://cdn77.sadanduseless.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/nightmare8.png ) one . 
  [ europe by night in 2097 . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/d4rosut.jpg ) picture is amazing in its scope . 
  same as [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/irspemj.jpg ) action one !, 
  pfff , you plebs . 
  we got 4 percentage points on you !, 
  at the same time , since this is clearly a political video , i guess it could mean that capitalism is seen as a safer word compared to democracy for the average `` stuck '' muslim . 
  at 2:35 i hear something about `` capitalistic ideology : that is translated to `` democratic ideology ... yeah , that girl is deluded but this video is clearly bait . 
   mike lazaridis born in turkey by pontic parents , went to canada when he was 5 years old . 
  he counts . 
  ok , i will contribute to this thread by saying that the blackberry was co-founded by a greek guy , mike lazaridis . 
  you forgot the obvious answer : the western civilisation ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  ctrl + f : greek . 
  no results found :(, 
  it 's stereotype time !, 
  prague is for holidays , geneva is boring , vienna is for christmas . 
  it 's a perfect test for people you do n't want to hang out with . 
  `` aaah , we need another junta ! '', 
  is my sign to nod and say bye . 
  does our military junta from '67 to '74 count ? 
  i know several people that dream of living in berlin . 
  and it 's not because they ca n't make it here in greece but because berlin has a cult status as a city for young adults . 
  greece at 54 ? 
  ur all h8ers !, 
  nice one !, 
  it 's not like those two are negative qualities . 
  i should have instead used :  ... said the frog who surrenders . 
  no kangaroos in austria . 
  ... said the cheese and wine lover !, 
  `` hands dirty '' as in shooting them ? 
  lol . 
  we should also execute all immigrants in the camps and sell their organs for money to pay our denbts . 
   that 's why in 2015 they were ~ ~ still ~ ~ trying to get greece to cut things , reduce corruption and raise taxes ~ ~ that they agreed to in 2012 ~ ~ even more . 
  there i fixed it for you . 
  in your `` fantasy land '' you may believe that we did n't raise taxes but it is incredibly irritating to greeks who are paying all their money on taxes to hear people like you say these kind of ridiculous things . 
  but no , all those poor people and the closing businesses must be because there are not enough taxes and cuts . 
  i 'd suggest artillery . 
  a plane would have to enter their airspace while immigrants in circus canons can be launched from the greek side . 
  they want to come to europe and they do n't stop them . 
  they do n't want to go to turkey so they wo n't magically start getting on boats and returning to turkey . 
  and please keep your `` rabid dogs '' comments to yourself . 
  nice two word reply . 
  you ca n't . 
   received a bailout on the promise of implementing austerity , ** refused to do it ** then that same crap all over again . 
  yeah , greece did * `` nothing '' * mate . 
  whatever makes you feel better . 
  a couple of notes on 2 : you ca n't stop them , and you ca n't return them back when the two territorial waters are next to each other . 
  on 3 : even if those rules were not there you can not force a country to accept people via deportation unless you have a deal with it . 
   we 'll send them back to turkey then in what way exactly ? 
  they can just `` make them '' leave and get on boats to greece . 
  europe ca n't make them return back * and * turkey does n't have to accept them . 
  well , your title is really incomplete !, 
  a theater is not a cinema !, 
  `` spreading democracy '' is not interfering ; it 's mere helping the barbarians over there . 
  oldest theater in continuous use maybe . 
  because for old theaters still in activity , the [ epidavros theater ] ( http://www.greece-is.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/pelop_epidauros_ancient_03.jpg ) in greece outshines the one listed by a couple of thousand years . 
   and is facing tough negotiations because they sort of were expecting to have their cake and eat it too . 
  the us is quote `` monolithic '' and has a very short history . 
  the eu consist of various discreet countries with * very * different cultures that have been in the making for thousands of years . 
  the whole concept of eu is being greek ( in my case ) first and european second ; in the us it 's being american first and everything else follows . 
  after all , your states do n't even have a strong ingrained specific culture that is that much different from the neighboring cultures . 
  as a tourist the only places you were bound to see immigrants were in chios , lesvos and samos plus in athens in the metro for a brief amount of time when they transiting through at peak numbers . 
  of course they were hit . 
  at the same time i recall countless reddit questions about greece being overrun by immigrants because that is what was shown on media . 
  still , a record year again , even with the strict capital controls in effect !, 
  the trend continues . 
   every year including 2015 and the total media over exposure of greek islands being covered with migrants . 
   looked it up . 
   were chosen via referendum multiple times in the 18 and 1900s . 
  to be precise those referendums asked about potential candidates , a ranking list was produced and then they picked the higher ranking ones that agreed . 
   they smash plates on the floor that 's for tourists only nowadays , we prefer throwing flowers .
