   pusti malaka this universal ancient greek truth is even more important nowadays than back then . 
   leave with the product . 
  no it 's not . 
  please do n't advise future tourists to have problems with the police for stealing . 
  now , in case it is a service ... 
   it 's common practice on ~ ~ r/greece ~ ~ reddit where the majority of people have yet to understand what the downvote button is for and treat it like a dislike . 
  that 's a communal house for midgets in trikala . 
  sorry for the late reply ; it 's at the athens university campus in zografou . 
  it 's called : `` house of venom '' .

  you should have googled your name timo !, 
  you can now create a bullshit story how timo is close to the word `` thimos '' that means anger in greek . 
  so you are the person that angers god . 
  better than `` fear '' !, 
  you needed a greek person to burst this bubble , so i 'll do it . 
  timotheus ( \u03a4\u03b9\u03bc\u03cc\u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2 ) does n't mean `` fear god '' . 
  it means that you `` honor '' god . 
  so as a timo you just `` honor '' !, 
  it 's not disturbing at all ; it 's just that we recognise the word automatically !, 
  maybe because his precious zurich is only number 2 !, 
  i was referring to specific bans that are in place in germany that concern the holocaust , the swastika , the `` salute '' and so on . 
  i was sort of wondering if there is a specific ban in place when hatred of jews is concerned . 
  i was referring to specific bans that are in place in germany that concern the holocaust , the swastika , the `` salute '' and so on . 
  i was sort of wondering if there is a specific ban in place when hatred of jews is concerned . 
  random query : why do you `` eat blood '' ? 
  is it a reference to something else ? 
   your national treasures have been auctioned off to german banks i 'll need a reference for the `` national treasure '' thingy . 
  after all , it is the uk that still holds the parthenon marbles that are our national treasures . 
   but i suppose britain will no longer pay for your country in a few years time . 
  even outside of the eu you will still be exposed to greek bank debt , so no , you will still have to cover your banks ' asses in one way or another . 
  why should i pay while the uk saves our beautiful important banks with their precious pounds ? 
   `` i hate all ~ ~ < insert group of people here  ~ ~ jews !!! '', 
  i believe that might be a problem in germany on its own , right ? 
  for every 100 pounds uk pays , 95 go to our banks . 
  thank you for financing our banks !, 
   i say ** we ** ban them does not compute, 
   spend your money ~ ~ elsewhere ~ ~ in greece . 
  pollfish is an organisation that is now mostly based in the states from what i know and deals with the worldwide market . 
  skroutz is mostly about greece so it 's absolutely normal that one is better funded than the other . 
  cause we are in / r/europe , not on / r/askhistory . 
  after all , dutch indies are low in the list with 4.3 % to 5.76 % of the population as casualties . 
  it 's not like it is a contest in the end . 
  are the dutch indies europe ? 
  belarus was a soviet republic , not a country per se back then . 
  but you are right , the soviet union in total is no 3 in the list with around 13 % of it 's population perishing . 
   one of the countries that suffered the most per capita from the nazis . 
  as far as europe is concerned casualties per capita puts the netherlands in the 10th position with 2.41 % of the population dying . 
  my country , greece is at the 5th position with 7-11 % of the population depending on estimates . 
  poland is no 1 with around 17 % of it 's population dying . 
  `` bashing on feminists '' is a whole youtube / twitter niche . 
  my point remains . 
  also , saying that someone `` deep down must feel inadequate '' is a terrible response since it can be leveraged about anyone . 
  you post negatively about trump / farrage / clinton / lepen or whatever ? 
  you must feel inadequate . 
  that 's the definition of pandering to his audience . 
  the exact same thing that all media , from small time internet `` celebrities '' like him , to big organisations , like huffington post , do . 
   like it 's possible to be pro immigration but think that the levels experienced in recent years are unsustainable and should be more limited while the eu could put money in for camps in turkey to help refugees that need it . 
  nope , sorry . 
  this is an unacceptable position . 
  you are either for or against immigration in general . 
  you meant to say `` rats in suits '' !, 
   well , you could `` resettle '' them armenian style . 
  totally a ok . , 
   i ca n't find any statistics for percentage of incidences of sexual harassment reported it is sort of impossible ti get such a number since you need a ( cases reported ) / ( incidents happened ) ratio . 
  the latter can not be directly calculated . 
  i know about that stupid erasmian thing . 
  thank god for the erasmus exchange program or else i 'd hate that guy so much !, 
  well , if you claim your territorial waters to be a around 150 nautical miles you can claim this island . 
  i was seriously triggered at the `` panta rei '' pronunciation !, 
  it 's `` panta ri '' godamnit !, 
  shut up with your logic !, 
  we need to say bad stuff for trump to feel good about ourselves !, 
  it 's a bit far away from your coast ... you need to conquer athens before that . 
  cleaning the kitchen and the utensils is the problem , especially when you have other stuff to do right after . 
  croatian canadian canadairs !, 
  battlefield 1 soldier voices have spoiled italian for me . 
   what i do care is that we took care at our end of the deal and kept the turkish minority in thrace alive and well you did n't . 
   oh wow we fired some bullets to empty ~ ~ seas ~ ~ land that we said we would . 
  damn look at evil fascist ~ ~ turkey ~ ~ greece out to invade poor poor ~ ~ greece ~ ~ turkey . 
  i feel bad for the ~ ~ greek ~ ~ turkish ~ ~ water ~ ~ clay molecules ... 
   5 different major country invaded anatolia and occupied/killed millions of people next up : how those 5 countries perpetuated the armenian genocide . 
  good luck getting that minimum wage in greece . 
  companies usually just hire you as a part time worker and then work you as a full time worker , or they just hire you for whatever the market pays undocumented . 
  cheers !, 
  i ma ashamed to say i have n't been to rome yet ... sparta is nothing to write home about but the area itself has amazing things to see such as [ monemvasia ] ( http://www.alexandria-institute.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/monemvasia-view1.jpg ) , [ mystras ] ( https://mediaevalmusings.wordpress.com/2012/03/29/mystras-city-on-a-hill/ ) , [ elafonisos ] ( http://static.in2life.gr/media/pics/pics680/473275-elafonisos2011-gal-3_163621_a3y434.jpg ) and the easily visited [ diros cave ] ( http://manimou.gr/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/diros9.jpg ) . 
  you should return . 
  and you may skip sparti , there 's not much to see unfortunately since building monuments , stadiums and palaces was not high in their list of war , war , war and war . 
  well , from op 's map you 've visited nestor 's palace , mycene and knossos . 
  hope you enjoyed it !, 
  it 's exactly like you remember it . 
  which did you visit ? 
  the fun part is that you can visit the archaeological sites of many of those ancient cities . 
  my favorite name for the city is mikligar\u00f0ur in icelandic which comes from the old norse name that vikings used for the city . 
  no it is constantinapole huehueheuheuheu . 
  both words have greet roots so i am ok , 
   people did n't like him because he ~ ~ was working for valve ( gaming company ) that has huge online market ( games , items for characters inside games ) that is not regulated ( it is only for legal purposes ) so it 's all about supply and demand ~ ~ cotributed heavily in the clusterfuck of last year 's negotiations between the greek governmet and eu and imf . 
  ~ ~ which he studied and wrote a book about . ~ ~ he is also somewhat to the ~ ~ right ~ ~ left . 
  i personaly think he is great , smart guy . 
   but you cite reality to defend militarization when you are citing your opinion when you are talking about war planes .
