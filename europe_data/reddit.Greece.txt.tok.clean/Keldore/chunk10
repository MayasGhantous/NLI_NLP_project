  we try and use nato as a shield against russian ambitions in our eastern part of our alliance . 
  be that the eu or nato in general . 
  in this interconnected world when poland is affected by something it wo n't be long untill you are too . 
  this is why there is a commitement to protect each other from foreign interventions . 
  your country belongs in the eu . 
  eu militaries stand no chance against foreign aggressions without american help . 
  it is simple as that . 
   i do n't think he 's against nato `` the only solution is an eu army and the phasing out nato ''  we know have someone in charge of the biggest army that is best buddies with vladimir putin , one of the biggest enemies of the nato rhetoric <  actual politics . 
  vice president reassured nato allies on the us 's commitement to nato . 
  the us continues its support in the baltics . 
   also , how is beeing against operations in the middle east ignorant ? 
  do you like the drone strikes ? 
  remember how obama was for change also ? 
  yeah nothing happened . 
  and there is a reason for that . 
  there is need to stop iranian influence in the region . 
  too big of a problem to analyze here . 
  i can refer you to kissinger 's excellent book `` world order '' . 
  read it . 
  it is worth it , trust me . 
   but obama was scared of political backlash and decided to leave it to the russians . 
  obama 's foreign policy was his weakest point . 
  i guess i wo n't argue with that . 
   how about explaining to him how he 's wrong ? 
  explaining why nato is important , why trump is not erdogan and why operations in the middle east are important are huge issues that are almost impossible to analyze in the reddit comment section . 
  i think you understand that . 
   the former prime minister accused hardline leave campaigners of ` shouting down anyone with an opposing view ' pardon me but it is usually the remainers who accuse brexiteers of being fascists pigs , undemocratic , antidemocratic , xenophobic etc. 
  i do n't even know where are you from . 
  how about you tell me first ? 
  against nato : check comparing trump to erdogan : check against operations in the middle east : check ignorant confirmed . 
   `` we reaffirm our commitment to rationalise and phase out , over the medium term , inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption , recognising the need to support the poor . 
  furthermore , we encourage all g20 countries which have not yet done so , to initiate as soon as feasible a peer review of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption . '',

  it 's not like germany owes money to nato . 
  the fact is there are nato countries which simply do n't contribute enough and that is a fact . 
  that has to change if we want this military alliance to be functional in the long run, 
  when it comes to international relations and war law is n't the law . 
  power is the law . 
  realpolitik . 
   sure , send them my way . 
  too arrogant , my friend . 
  too arrogant . 
  these guys spend their lives researching and operating missions and operations of this kind . 
  but no . 
  you know better . 
   kind of convenient that the swamp exxon ceo is in control of the state department ? 
  exxonmobil has enormous reach . 
  it even has its own intelligence department . 
  the dos is build on connections , intelligence and reach . 
  [ not ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gdlclhamb0 ) bringing toys to light up the mood and then failing to control the matters . 
   stealing resources from another country is a crime , that 's a fact . 
  world view means nothing to that . 
  tell that to the generals . 
  war has its own laws unfortunatelly . 
  crimes happen then follows an apology . 
  if you believe that the world is run on ethical law enforcement then i am afraid but you do n't have an actual understanding of international power politics . 
  it has happened [ before ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato_bombing_of_the_radio_television_of_serbia_headquarters ) , it will happen in the future . 
   also , you ignored the other part . 
  are n't you just so ever adorable . 
  if you tell me that my opinions are irrelevant what 's the point in me giving them to you ? 
   lol , you are actually trying to defend them planning to commit a war crime . 
  jesus you 're way too far gone . 
  i do n't know if you can actually be saved . 
  just because we do n't view the world in a same manner that means i need to be `` saved '' from my point of view by yours ? 
  get of your high horse buddy, 
  cutting off energy supplies and sources of trade in war is a pretty common tactic . 
  i do n't know of any wars that went by without similar acts . 
   amongst other war crimes he advocated again zero specifics . 
  just accusations . 
   you know illegally stealing another country 's natural resource is a war crime right ? 
  specifics ? 
  you mean oil in land under isis occupation ? 
   do you really hate facts so much ? 
  again not an argument  what experience does he have in government ? 
  you are aware that numerous positions in cabinets all over the years have been filled by non politicians ? 
  businessmen , economists , diplomats , lawyers etc. 
   how about the fact that tillerson was the head of exxonmobil when they were trying to strike a deal with russia to extract oil from millions of acres of russian land , but then came sanctions because of crimea . 
  a businessman wanted to strike a deal for the good of his company ? 
  oh my god i did n't even know things like that happened in our world . 
   rex tillerson as sos is the most disgusting display of corruption i 've seen in us politics . 
  can you prove that he got his positions after negotiating with the administration in order to benefit his own company ? 
  with concrete facts . 
  and no the fact that he is the exxonmobil guy is not an argument . 
  every sane oil person would want to strike a deal with russia . 
  war crimes ? 
  no experience ? 
  what ? 
  do we even live on the same planet ? 
  jeez man ... 
  not an argument, 
  in phenomenal cabinet picks like mattis or tillerson . 
  in promoting women in [ stem ] ( https://www.cnet.com/news/trump-women-in-stem-tech-laws/ ) , in [ this ] ( https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/28/presidential-executive-order-white-house-initiative-promote-excellence ) , in [ this ] ( https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/255/text?r=2 ) , in [ this ] ( https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/03/presidential-executive-order-core-principles-regulating-united-states ) etc. 
  i would n't say so . 
  have in mind the the americans built that federation from scratch many many years ago . 
  expanded , explored the land and even kept the whole thing intact for all these years without even having the telecommunication access we have today . 
  it is really one of the things that * really * amazes me in human history . 
  it was a collab effort between americans and british . 
  it was mainly an idea championed by w.wilson . 
  the death of wilson among other things lead to the senate voting it down . 
  the us is not an absolute monarchy .
