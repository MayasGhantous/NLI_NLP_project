  people are always looking for ways to defend themselves . 
  vicious dogs and guns are pretty common . 
  when he was appointed i was thinking `` he is greek . 
  he has seen the problems that comes with uncontrolled immigration waves first hand . 
  maybe he will do a good job '' . 
  little did i know ... 
  these people prefer to go to the usa instead of the eu . 
  better career prospects . 
  europe needs to step up its industrial game . 
  president trump and general mattis have moved forward with syrian zones of control and a possible creation of a kurdish state at north syria . 
  if that happens and turkey continues this crazy rhetoric their country is moving towards extreme irrelevance . 
  [ pastime in crete ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0ei93zw8wi ) [ funeral in crete ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ze2g4qklmwq ) [ party/wedding in crete ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ehd1l6vhgq ) ( shooting starts at 0:49 ) you get the idea i could show you many documentaries too but they are in greek with no subs . 
  they love their guns . 
  not everyone has one but there is gun culture . 
  in greece you are allowed to buy a rifle for hunting but you are not allowed to have a gun at home for self defence even if you live in rural areas way away from the police . 
  guess what people do . 
  they buy hunting rifles for their homes . 
  literally every single house in rural greece has a gun . 
  not to mentions crete . 
  these guys have war arsenals in their homes . 
  i mean ak-47s and stuff . 
  guns laws in europe make no sense . 
  switzerland once again being the sane one in the continent . 
  i am not even christian but that does n't mean that i would try and hide the fact that one of the pillars of the west is the christian ethos . 
  where did i say anything about hate ? 
  i am all for intercivilizational debate . 
  i just want the west to remain liberal . 
  that is all . 
  there is more to the western civilization than just the christian ethos . 
  laws do n't change the people . 
  just because a bunch of generals and politicians passed some laws that does n't mean that the people 's traditions will change . 
  you can see turkey 's islamic traditions emerging once again and the huge support for erdoganism and you still have doupts ? 
  you may joke about it but there are people in here use that argument . 
  so just because i am greek my argument becomes irrelevant ? 
  it does n't matter that it is turkey . 
  it could be any other islamic country . 
  my point still is that we ca n't have an islamic country ( that even has borders with iraq and syria ) in a union of western liberal democracies and traditions . 
  i do n't see how this is not rational, 
  open borders with an islamic country that borders syria and iraq ? 
  yea no problem at all . 
  absolutely * no * justifiably reason to reject them . 
  except that countries like poland or the uk are western countries . 
  [ turkey is not even european . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz3r5i28bp8 ), 
  i 've seen so many excuses and all sort of weird reasons that people believe that turkey is a legit western country that i really ca n't tell if people are serious or not on this issue . 
  where is the / s ? 
  according to cultural relativists and `` never seen a map '' people in this sub turkey is perfectly european and if it was n't for erdogan everything would be great because `` muh kemalism '' . 
  not sarcasm . 
  you may not like it because of your political bias but the conservatives were truly a force transformed the country for the better . 
  the conservatives were really a blessing for the uk . 
  criminal has a gun -  state passes law to restrict access to guns -  criminal still has a gun, 
  your comment has been declared as hate speech because you are accusing me of hate speech and so it is scheduled for deletion . 
  hate speech laws are the stupidest laws around . 
  not only they are stupid but they hide great danger in them too . 
  and many people still believe samuel p. huntington 's theory regarding the clash of civilizations was wrong . 
  little do they know ... 
  many say davutoglu greatly influenced erdogan, 
  he enjoys huge support by the turkish people . 
  even if he goes the legacy will stay . 
  so he wants weak leftists like hollande because they are easier to pick on . 
  his actions are just more reasons for the dutch to vote for either rutte or wilders . 
  erdogan probably got his hands on [ this book ] ( http://imgur.com/a/wp6at ) . 
  there is no other explanation, 
  syriza campaigned using the slogan `` first time , left '' ( or left for the first time ) i am glad it turns out to be `` last time , left '' ( left for the last time ) we should move forward with nd . 
  business friendly , law and order , pro-eu . 
  really sad turn of events . 
  i really wanted him to win . 
  now it seems it will be a macron vs le pen . 
  true i just tried to show that it was n't just an act of `` protecting '' turks but an actual invasion . 
  cyprus : north parts of the island with 80 % greek population . 
  greeks are trying for years to unite the island with the greek state . 
  we call that [ enosis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enosis ) . 
  after the military coup in greece back in the 60s/70s there was an attempt to stage a coup in cyprus too in order to overthrow the then leadership that was against the junta in greece and replace him with a pro enosis guy . 
  the turks said `` we have turks there , we invade now to protect them '' . 
  of course this was an excuse to invade and justify their pan-turkism . 
  they got in and kicked the greeks from the homes in the north and [ destroyed their churches ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_invasion_of_cyprus#destruction_of_cultural_heritage ) . 
  they also brought turks to live on the island to justify their move by having more population there . 
  both sides fought hard . 
  i mean atrocities and stuff . 
  the turks created a [ state ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_cyprus ) that is not recognized by anyone except turkey . 
  since the turks had no business to intervene in another state 's business the un security council today does n't recognize the illegal state in the north . 
  is is not about revenge . 
  it is about consequences of actions . 
  you ca n't just get away with genocide . 
  we are both trying to educate the youth about the past but we also have to be strict about the international rules or agreements . 
  if there is no punishment nothing stops one from taking similar actions, 
  again as i said to the guy above , telling me that i have no idea about something is not an argument . 
  instead of downvoting to disprove me present actual arguments . 
  my point was clear . 
  if the mhp people will have to choose between the akp or the chp will go for the akp . 
  islamist or nationalist the rhetoric of the party resonates well witht he mhp people . 
   we can issue an apology ( actually we did , under the name of massacre ) massacre <  genocide  i 'll never let this genocide thingy to become a political leverage for the armenian nationalists who demand unconditional payment from turkey . 
   i am all in for remembrance first of all it 's not a `` thingy '' . 
  secondly do you really thing just because turkey put this in books it should pass without any retaliation ? 
  this kind of logic sends the signal that `` it is ok to brutally murder people as long as you are willing to say sorry and acknowledge that you did '', 
  would you mind telling us your opinion on the armenian genocide too ? 
  out of curiousity i just want to see how far are you willing to go in order to justify the wrongdoings of your country . 
  oh my you are actually trying to justify the invasion . 
  no wonders hardly anyone take you guys seriously . 
  if erdogan is not nationalist enough for them then why is the chp ?
