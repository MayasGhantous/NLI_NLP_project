  i would n't say they belong in the dumpster next to marxists . 
  knut wicksell of the swedish school of economics and his theory of interest also was partialy influenced and adopted by austrians . 
  well it is clear in the manifesto * he * wrote . 
  `` communist openly declare that their ends can be attained ** only ** by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions '', 
   he did n't want a violent overthrow , he saw it as a necessary consequence of the conditions at the time . 
  `` i do n't want to do it but i has to be done '' is advocating for it to happen though . 
  not an argument, 
  societies that were not infected by marxism ( australia , na etc. ), 
  while having rich and poor people did n't experience class conflict rhetoric at a significant scale . 
  the guy was certainly advocating for violence and terrorism . 
  here is a quote from the manifesto :  the communists disdain to conceal their views and aims . 
  they openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the ** forcible overthrow ** of all existing social conditions . 
  let the ruling classes tremble at a communistic revolution . 
  europe can certainly do better than marx . 
  austrian economist eugen b\u00f6hm von bawerk ( the guy that was on the 100 austrian schilling ) wrote a great critique against marx 's infantile views on the economy back in 1898 . 
  good thing that marxism is a thing of the past . 
  not only its economic aspects but its hateful ideology of civil war and class conflict too . 
  another pointless government regulation , another sad day for liberty in europe . 
  reminds me of the gema imbeciles in germany, 
  and you mean that we should n't build skyscrapers ? 
  i find skyscrapers fascinating to be honest . 
  they are imposing man made sights . 
  the bull is zeus . 
  he transformed into a bull in order to kidnap and seduce europa . 
  which is kind of ironic if you think that we decided to use that image in our 2 euro coin . 
  prophetic in a way . 
  you know ... seducing europeans , telling them that we are cool , getting on board and then stuff happens . 
  i may be wrong but in that case would n't tokyo had less skyscrapers ? 
  i might be missing something, 
  i 've read somewhere that they do n't build skyscrapers so that they do n't ruin the acropolis skyline . 
  which is stupid imo . 
  stunning painting, 
  cheers , 
  all these places are basically influential due to nato interests . 
  and let 's not forget that nato is basically `` us and friends '', 
  bad decision . 
  government stepping in to protect unions thus decreasing competition leading to higher prices and worst services . 
  something better has arrived and we do n't seem to want to evolve . 
  such a shame . 
   that 's kind of the point of currencies . 
  not really . 
  but from your `` people '' point you are right . 
  i am just looking at it from a broader perspective . 
   in a democracy you get influence from representation except that the eu is not a democracy ( yet at least ) . 
  the parliament is pretty weak and all the decisions are being made by appointed commissioners . 
  first of all being pro brexit does n't make you an extremist or a moderate . 
  the referendum has nothing to do with this . 
  the guy called for the rehabilitation of * leon trotsky * in parliament . 
  he supports antisemetic entities like hamas ( then recalling for political reasons of course ) . 
  not to mention his fringe views on economics that have alienated big part of his own party . 
   from ** my point of view ** , it only reduces bureaucracy . 
  adding a federal system over national system would only increase bureaucracy . 
  does the system promote free market ideas that lower bureaucracy ? 
  sure . 
  no fees as you said . 
  but take a look at the decision process or the electoral . 
  there is overhead and we can fix that . 
   the $ uro is pretty great , because i do n't have to exchange currencies we do n't judge a currency based on how it makes shopping easier . 
   it does n't have much geopolitical influence because it 's an intentionally weak institution . 
  which i find wrong . 
  by being weak we are relying on foreign powers like the us to address our own neighborhood 's problems . 
   nonsense . 
  there is no one attacking the eu . 
  there is a reason we have assembled strong forces in the baltics . 
  do n't kid yourself . 
  the eu has enemies ready to devour us the first chance they get . 
  better safe than sorry . 
   smaller countries are massively over-represented . 
  i said influence . 
  not representation . 
  i am pretty sure malta does n't have the most important voice when it comes to eu policy . 
   how does the eu have anything to do with this ? 
  because it is uncompetitive and heavily social democratic compared to canada , the us or australia . 
  there is a reason skilled indian let 's say students prefer the better american institutions for higher education and then work . 
  the eu does n't have an mit . 
  the eu does n't have a silicon valley . 
   i voted for a party in the eu parliament no you did n't . 
  you voted for your national party that is a member of a eu party . 
  and that often turns into a national debate rather than a european . 
  i will give you an example . 
  2014 greece . 
  the far left syriza party won the euroelection . 
  that sparkled a national debate about the legitimacy of the national government . 
  i was not about europe but it was rather a protest against the then ruling national party . 
   i definitely prefer relative representation me too . 
  i just think it would be better for us to vote directly for the epp instead of the cdu . 
  vote directly for the president instead doing it via parties . 
  the way the americans do it . 
  the real point in my opinion is this . 
  if during the last century irishmen , italian , germans , swedes decided to be americans why ca n't they work towards being european ? 
  you will say to me that many people do n't want to be europeans . 
  understandable . 
  strong state 's right could solve this issue . 
  in the end this is a democratic effort . 
  we ca n't force the eu on anyone . 
  i am just promoting my idea of a united europe . 
  not saying i am right or wrong . 
  during the early days or even during the early 20th century people of all kinds of walks of life become americans . 
  if italians , irish and germans decided to be americans they can works towards being europeans too . 
  many of them were semi independent colonies ( ne ) .
