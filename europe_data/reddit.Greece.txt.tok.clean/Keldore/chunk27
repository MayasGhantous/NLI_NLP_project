  that does n't mean that i am happy with the state being spendaholic  show me someone who has a platform of getting rid of free healthcare and education and show me he is supported by a significant amount of people it is a known fact that in greece statist and marxist ideologies are all over the place . 
  i know i am in the minority, 
   living full time in greece something i doubt you do . 
  yea i live full time in greece . 
  sorry to dissapoint you  they can examine you , perform medical tests and prescribe medicine but can not put you back together if you are in car accident per se . 
  or provide intensive care themselves . 
  still do n't know what you are talking about . 
  i myself and many people i know had surgery in these private practitioners ' clinics . 
   i suppose you do not have much experience with health issues if you think all you need for health care is a visit to the doctor for an examination ( which is all 30-50 $ will get you in the private sector , certainly not hospitalization ) recently i had a routine surgery for 300 euros . 
  what is your point ? 
   take that libertarian out of here . 
  it is free . 
  you are not limited in the care you receive according to your financial status . 
  first of all take a chill pill . 
  as far as my libertarianism goes it is here to stay . 
  you crying wo n't change that . 
  and no it is not `` free '' to get back on point . 
  you pay for it . 
  i pay for it . 
  stop using words to scam people into supporting it . 
   not because it provides you with healthcare , because you live and make money in it . 
  actually taxes are gathered to pay for things like healthcare . 
  so yea they tax me to pay for healthcare ( not only healthcare though ) . 
  and no i am not happy paying into a system that provides third rate quality services . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  first of all there is a huge movement growing that supports private universities in greece . 
  that is as far as your education comment . 
  now on to healthcare . 
  there are private clinics , hospitals and there public hospitals . 
  greece is full of private clinics . 
  no necessarily big hospitals . 
  but instead private doctors operating solo . 
  and it is not even expensive . 
  thirty to fifty euros per visit . 
  i really have no idea where you pulled that ( that in most places there are no private hospitals ) out from . 
  and again as i said earlier . 
  the ** public ** system is ** not free ** . 
  when you say `` free '' healthcare the only thing i can think of is that you have never paid taxes in your life . 
  - rich - conservative-leaning - get to keep their guns after conscription - very expensive country to visit - nice chocolate - great landscapes, 
  both of our systems have merits . 
  nothing is black and white . 
  but our welfare system is way too excessive and unaffortable . 
  and do n't ever think that our healthcare is free . 
  we have public healthcare but people prefer private clinics ( at least in greece ) because the public healthcare system is bad . 
  really bad . 
  actual story : one of my friends was having stomach pain . 
  the doctor in the public hospital got him ready for a * surgery * because they though it was gastroenteritis . 
  he could n't believe it so he also visited a private clinic . 
  it turned out it was just food poisoning . 
  sure there is room for improvement in the us healthcare system . 
  but please do n't take moore seriously . 
  he really overstreches things . 
  i am actually greek canadian but from my experience a lot of people i know in canada prefer to travel to us for stuff like surgery or serious problems because there are no wait lines and the quality is superb . 
  yes it costs more but its quality is undeniable . 
  there is no such thing as a free lunch is a saying . 
  it means that nothing you get is for free . 
  he is not literally referring to a lunch . 
  life advice : stop watching michael moore  adding this to free health care and free college and the much more wholesome school lunches they also noted , an an american , i was super impressed . 
  now have a look at real numbers and how these things work out and then i am not sure you will have the same impression of such policies . 
  in greece we have a lot of these policies and we are having a real struggle trying to get rid of them because they are too expensive . 
  also do n't use the word `` free '' . 
  there is no such thing as a free lunch . 
  i pay almost 70-80 cents of every euro i make to finance such wasteful policies . 
  got ta love the finnish people . 
  the scandinavians think they are russian , the russians think they are potential russians . 
  and the finnish themselves could n't care less about both of them . 
  these left wing parties have no real power . 
  the sane social democratcs will merge with the other centrist parties in order to counter the surge of the conservative right . 
  thus the traditional social democrats split and downfall . 
  the new center front will be bigger and stronger since it will not only have social democrats but the christian democrats too . 
  the leftist parties will be alone and weaker . 
  well that was a pretty crucial part of my comment that you left out . 
  i used the ndp to make the comparison between social democracy and liberalism . 
  you ca n't just skip that part, 
  so you are telling me that the liberals are the same as the ndp in canada ? 
  i pretty sure you know you are wrong, 
  yea because jean chr\u00e9tien banned unions and put the poor in work houses . 
  oh , he also hated the poor / s, 
  if the left wants populists and socialists to represent them they are free to do so . 
  but they will also have to understand the consequencies of that too . 
  i personally think jeremy corbyn and alexis tsipras are enough to show us how disastrous their policies or rhetoric can be . 
  before wwii and briefly during the 90s i think . 
  blair moved labour closer to liberalism , clinton too . 
  it was a trend . 
  even in my country the social democratic party during the 90s was more liberal . 
  the same liberalism that is being practised by the democratic party in the us or the liberal party in canada . 
  and do n't try and tell me that these are social democratic parties . 
  if you make the comparision between the liberal party and the ndp you will see the difference . 
  yea if you take a look at the [ delian league ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/delian_league ) map for instance , it is easy to come to that conclusion . 
  sea routes and naval trade or warfare were a big part of the ancient greek tradition, 
  the netherlands have been traditionaly ruled by conservative , christian democrat or liberal pms . 
  their policies have made the netherlands a great country and there is no need to change that . 
  plus wherever social democracy loses ground it is a good thing . 
  it is time for the left to become liberal again . 
  but that is just my opinion . 
  good, 
  we are not sure if homer 's ithaca is today 's ithaca . 
  the place homer was referring to is still up for debate . 
  i do n't really know . 
  i just randomly came across with this one .
