  anglosaxon conservatism is what really makes the distiction between the uk and mainland europe i believe . 
  as a conservative and a ** humongous ** admirer of your country , the usa , it is pretty hard for me to try and sell you leftist cities/countries as good places to relocate . 
  but i can tell you what to avoid avoid france . 
  france will shift to the right . 
  fillon will probably be president and he is a thatcherite . 
  i will love it , you will hate it . 
  if you choose sweden avoid places like malm\u00f6 . 
  just check for local news there and you will understand . 
  generally avoid the south . 
  pretty bad economic situation . 
  the north and the south do n't even compare when it comes to way of life and economic prosperity . 
  again if you are a socialist and not just a liberal you can try greece . 
  we pay almost 80 cents out of every euro we make to the government and give handouts we ca n't afford . 
  socialist wet dream . 
  avoid the uk . 
  it is pretty much not european . 
  not because of brexit but culturally . 
  they belong to the anglosaxon family which is generally more right wing than you would prefer . 
  but you already know this because you are american . 
  and lastly avoid norway . 
  it is way too expensive there . 
  you know what they say . 
  `` visiting norway is a once in a lifetime experience . 
  you ca n't afford to come back '', 
  pro-government people are the overwhelming majority in turkey . 
  at least according to your elections, 
  it would be better to ask a turk i guess . 
  over the past months they have made comments such as `` the treaty of laussane is negotiable '' etc. 
  you get the idea . 
  my opinion is that they believe that turkey got screwed because they did n't get more access to the aegean sea or thrace . 
  they are basically promoting neo-ottoman irredentism . 
  they do n't want a small turkey . 
  they want a big ottoman empire that stands up to the west and has control over the region . 
   the greek authorities who until today have obstructed the members of the terrorist organisations , primarily the dhkp/c and pkk that have targeted turkey to be held accountable in front of the justice , have with this decision once more displayed that greece , an ally and a neighbouring country , refrains from fulfilling the minimum requirements of combatting terrorism and crime . 
   this attitude of the greek judiciary , in contradiction with the norms and principles of international law  the implications on our bilateral relations , ... , will also be comprehensively evaluated . 
  i can already see more airspace violations , maybe some muslim prayers in hagia sophia and definatelly some comments about greek islands being turkish and how the west screwed turkey with the signing of the treaty of laussane . 
  i am glad the supreme court literally guarded these people from the inhumane treatment they would have got , had they been returned to turkey . 
  not a nato country, 
  war is a reality . 
  read herbert hoover right before wwii . 
  everyone though that after wwi war was not going to happen again because it was not beneficiary . 
  first of all to meet the nato agreement . 
  secondly turkey is a neighbour with irridentist tendencies and provoking attitude . 
  turkish warplanes constantly violate greek airspace and undermine national borders . 
  there have been times where they have violate greek airspace other 20 times in just under 24 hours . 
  more recently they have started talking about how the treaty of laussane was bad for turkey and it is subject to change . 
  undermining international treaties should raise concerns not just among greeks . 
  the uncompromising stance they keep regarding the illigally occuppied northern cyprus . 
  you get the idea . 
  if you think the turkish-greek relations are like norwegian-swedish relations you are living on another planet . 
   if not for us you would be quickly overwhelmed by refugees turkey `` our ally '' [ blackmails ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/c5197e60-b2fc-11e6-9c37-5787335499a0 ) europe using refugees as leverage . 
  do n't try and tell me that turkey `` protects '' europe from the refugee waves also rhetoric mobilizes the masses . 
  if erdogan uses rhetoric that undermines international treaties then of course it has importance in the international arena . 
  thinking otherwise would be ignorant, 
  guarding our borders ? 
  i hope this is a joke i just did n't get . 
  turkish airforce violating greek airspace and turkish officials talking about how the treaty of laussane is bad ... with friends like that , who needs enemies ? 
  and this is why trump talks about freeloaders . 
  if greece can do it there is ** no ** excuse for other nato countries not to . 
  all i hear from europeans is that `` we cant rely anymore on the us '' etc. 
  well do something about it . 
  national defence is one of the most important pillars that hold a country up . 
  if we ever form a european federal army i hope to see a more collective effort . 
  europe does n't have the best of neighbours . 
  russia in the north , turkey or even syria in the east , and even the north african coast in the south . 
  we should not get too comfortable in this unstable world . 
  yea sure a country can be two things . 
  greece has many things in common with both the south and the east . 
  we say `` una faccia , una razza '' a lot when we compare ourselves to the italians but we also ca n't deny the orthodox ( in a cultural sense , not religious ) aspect of our tradition . 
  that being said i agree with you . 
  i believe today greece is better described as a mediterrenean country . 
  there are many things that can characterize greece as an eastern european country . 
  a lot of european traditions , ethics , norms etc. 
  come from the roman empire era . 
  greece was part of the * eastern * roman empire ( byzantine empire ) . 
  the divide in the greek memory between west and east for getting bigger as greeks experienced the fourth crusade against constantinopole and the failure of western allies to protect the city against islamic conquerors during its last days . 
  greece did n't experience the western renaissance ( in the same way other southern country like italy for instance did ) because it was under ottoman occupation . 
  of course it was easy to come back to the european traditions after almost have a millenium of ottoman tradition because most of the renaissance texture was greek . 
  in modern times greece was surrounded by soviet countries and had domestically strong pro-soviet forces . 
  so greece used to operate like an island in the east trying to work with our western allies in europe . 
  lastly ( again going back to byzantine tradition ) many greek people have really strong ties to country like russia and serbia . 
  orthodox brothers as they call it . 
  in greece we say in general that we stand with one foot in the east and with the other in the west [ fun fact : when samuel huntington wrote his classic `` clash of civilizations '' he put greece in the orthodox world and out of the western civilization . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/clash_of_civilizations_mapn2.png ), 
  the sad thing is mitsotakis is our last stand against complete sovietization . 
  if he fails there will be no other chance like this to reform our statist economy . 
  mitsotakis is as libertarian as you can get in nd . 
  not enough you might say . 
  true . 
  but if he fails then the left will march against him blaming the economic woes on mitsotakis ' `` thatcherism '' . 
  they used the same tactic against his father . 
  i did a year in the university of patras and 5 in atei of thessaly . 
  ideologically i am too an anarchowhatever but reality strikes hard and we have to make compromises . 
  nd seems to be on the right path at the moment . 
  drassi joined nd yesterday and more and more free makret and libertarian people in general are gathering to oust syriza, 
  yeah i am a libertarian . 
  greek universities are marxist nests . 
  i can hardly find a handful of libertarian , or even liberal , oriented people there . 
  most of the people there are marxists or anarchowhatevers, 
  we are that eastern european country that did n't experience communism and many people here view socialism romantically .
