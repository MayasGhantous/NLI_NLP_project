   i fear we have over-learned the lessons of iraq and now see any intervention as bad . 
  the irony is a lot of trump supporters do n't support the move . 
  on the other hand liberals support it . 
  even not trump supporters in the gop like mccain support the strikes . 
  this will give trump a boost for re election even in clinton cities . 
  the main issue about us is what the eu is going to do . 
  i do n't want to see an idle eu just issuing statements and waiting for the americans and french to do the dirty job . 
  intervention is needed . 
  watching your neighbor 's house being on fire and doing nothing will soon lead to your house being on fire too . 
  i for once want to see europe as a whole back the us . 
  it is our own neighborhood we are talking about . 
  syria affects us immediately . 
  the assad dynasty has wrecked that country . 
  using chemical weapons on your own people in absolutely inexcusable . 
  good thing that the us , france and uk support action . 
  fuck me , i did n't catch the `` the '' in front of the damaging . 
  i need a bigger screen ... 
  damaging the legacy ? 
  what legacy ? 
  the legacy of oppression and bloodshed ? 
  it was already damaged . 
  not only they invaded the island but they also have the audacity to cause problems with the commemoration of the history of the island prior to their invasion ? 
  they blocked the reunification talks because of this . 
  i hope this is the last thing given to them . 
   * u.s. president donald trump ordered missile strikes against a syrian airfield from which a deadly chemical weapons attack was launched *  ** australia ** , ** britain ** and ** turkey ** gave their ** support ** , with australian prime minister malcolm turnbull calling it a `` proportionate '' response to the use of chemical weapons . 
   ** russian president vladimir putin ** believes * the strikes broke international law and seriously damaged u.s.-russia relations *  ** iran ** * denounced * the `` destructive and dangerous '' strike  `` the ** u.k. government fully supports ** the u.s. action , which we believe was an appropriate response to the barbaric chemical weapons attack launched by the syrian regime and is intended to deter further attacks , '' a government spokesman said . 
   ** turkey ** viewed the strikes * positively * and the international community should sustain its stance against the `` barbarity '' of the syrian government  ** french foreign minister jean-marc ayrault ** said russia and iran needed to understand that supporting assad made no sense and that the escalation of the u.s. military role in syria was a `` warning '' to `` a criminal regime '' . 
   `` at the same time , * indonesia * is * concerned * with unilateral actions by any parties , including the use of tomahawk missiles , in responding to the chemical weapon attack tragedy in syria , ''  a spokesman for the ** polish ** government said the united states was a guarantor of world peace and there were times when you needed to react . 
   2 million people identify as macedonians good to know . 
  in the future i may want to identify as an egyptian . 
  when i get bored of that i 'll identify as a turk . 
  yea definitely a turk . 
  kemal was born in thessaloniki . 
  he was greek ^ / s  and speak macedonian the macedonians spoke greek . 
  you speak a bulgarianish language renamed macedonian because of reasons . 
  feel free to read some [ actual scholars ] ( https://www.amazon.com/macedonian-state-institutions-clarendon-paperbacks/dp/0198149271 ) writing about the issue . 
  and [ another one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcyg1tvdm5y ) . 
  also the oxford classical dictionary is great too . 
  requires a sub though . 
   these people are pure bulgarians parading as `` ancient macedons '' . 
  amen brother  you could 've avoided that if you had sided with bulgaria in 1913 when serbia stole that region against its initial agreement with sofia . 
  i think that there was a defensive agreement between greece and serbia . 
  not quite sure though, 
   you honestly sound retarded . 
  what 's retarded about historical facts ? 
  you know , calling names and being unable to back your arguments with facts is what is actually laughable . 
  a lot of these mottos were influenced by the anti-ottoman nationalists movements of the 19th century . 
  of course they picked these aspects too . 
  let 's not forget that these people are * actually bulgarians *, 
  this kind of rhetoric was adopted during the revolution of 1821 . 
  a lot of greek intellectual at the time were heavily influenced by the american and french liberalism . 
  a similar phrase is attributed to us anti-federalist patrick henry . 
  `` give me liberty or give me death '' . 
  figures like [ adamantios korais ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adamantios_korais ) were in touch with americans like thomas jefferson ofter talking about radical libertarian ideals . 
  in his memoirs [ kolokotronis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/theodoros_kolokotronis ) and [ makriyannis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yannis_makriyannis ) talk a lot about the influence that washington and napoleon had on our revolution . 
   what the hell , you all had the opportunity to use something like this ? 
  well greece is more than macedonia . 
  in macedonia ( gr ) [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/flag_of_greek_macedonia.svg/1200px-flag_of_greek_macedonia.svg.png ) flies everywhere next to the greek flag though . 
  mainly at government buildings . 
  their next move : new white and blue flag, 
  wait a minute . 
  * that * country uses our motto too ? 
  triggered . 
  this is funny the least . 
  it gets `` better '' everyday . 
  turning millions into billions is not an easy task to achieve . 
  i would n't say his untalented . 
  going from millions to billions , winning the presidency etc. 
   `` our defence relationship with the us is unprecedented in its depth and scope . 
  as we leave the eu , our bilateral relationships matter more than ever , so we 'll be enhancing our cooperation and investing more in our joint f-35 fast jet programme . '' he is right . 
  that does n't mean that the uk or the us will stop cooperating with the eu though . 
  i am a huge fan of the work of huntington . 
  i have pointed people to that book many times but they judge based on feelings and dismiss his analysis . 
  his work is more relevant than ever . 
  that is like saying americans should n't be liberals because woodrow wilson who was a liberal was also a notorious racist . 
  or that we should n't play chess because bobby fischer was an antisemite . 
  he is considered to be that but some . 
  other consider him to be one of the most effective secretaries of state in history . 
  mainly for his work with china . 
  that does n't make him uninformed though . 
  he was an insider for years . 
  he knows a thing or two that we may not know . 
  his words carry some weight . 
  juncker threatens the us ... yea it does n't work like that . 
  stupid move of him to say something like that . 
  i am from ontario . 
  tons of flags around . 
  if not on flagpoles people hang them from windows . 
  brantford , mississauga etc. 
  mainly the suburbs . 
  as edmund burke put it `` society is indeed a contract [ ... ] . 
  it is a partnership in all science ; a partnership in all art ; a partnership in every virtue , and in all perfection . 
  as the ends of such a partnership can not be obtained in many generations , * it becomes a partnership not only between those who are living , but between those who are to be born * '' we should n't take our liberties for granted . 
  people before us worked for them . 
  and we work to conserve and advance what was given to us . 
  nothing obnoxious about that . 
   people on this sub underestimate how polarizing fillon and macron i 've been called a theocrat by some french people even though i am not even religious just for support fillon . 
  polarizing is a mild word . 
  i find this pretty sad to be honest . 
  i do n't think her electtion is very likely .
