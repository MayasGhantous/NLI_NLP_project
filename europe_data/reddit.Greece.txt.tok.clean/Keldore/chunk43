  when the revolution broke out he was one of the few greeks that did n't join the filiki eteria . 
  after the turks committed the massacre of chios that outraged both greeks and other europeans , canaris and a bunch of other guys , attacked in a stealthy manner and destroyed the ottoman frigate of nasuhzade ali pasha . 
  casualties also included the turkish admiral nasuhzade ali pasha . 
  after the succesful attack canaris continued with the attacks throughout the year . 
  in retaliation the ottomans captured canaris ' home island , psara . 
  more than 5000-7000 greeks were slaughtered . 
  canaris managed to escape the invasion . 
  thanks to his naval combat skills he later went on to become an officer of new greek navy . 
  after the revolution he became pm of greece . 
  extra bit of info : a nazi admiral named wilhelm canaris thought he was a descendant constantine canaris . 
  a family tree research took place in order to find out . 
  the results were negative as they revealed that his canaris name came from an italian ancestor and not the greek canaris family . 
  this is why i am for more eu integration . 
  it will give us greater influence . 
  influence that we lack at the moment . 
  i would really want the eu to be stronger and better . 
  i live in the eu . 
  the reality is sad though . 
  the eu has zero influnce even in its immediate neighborhood . 
  problems in the balkans ? 
  the us takes action . 
  problems in north africa ? 
  the us takes action ( together with the uk and france ) . 
  problems in the middle east ? 
  the us takes action . 
  problems in the aegean ? 
  the us takes action . 
  why ca n't the eu solve anything on its own ? 
  because the eu is weak . 
  for too long the eu has lived under the us umbrella , spending all its money on welfare and culture . 
  the thing is the real world has much more serious problems . 
  the moment the us pulls the plug out of europe the eu is done . 
  just imagine what would happen during the 90s in south eastern europe if it was n't for the us . 
  the western hemisphere is controled by the us . 
  the far east is dominated by china . 
  the middle east is a contested area where the us , russia and the islamic world is fighting for regional dominance . 
  where is the eu in world affairs ? 
  not even in europe . 
  because even in europe the us is taking care of the baltics , ukraine and the south east . 
  so back to your point about arrogance . 
  it makes sense for the uk to want to be with the big players . 
  and have in mind that global dealings are cynical and are based on realism . 
  not friendship . 
  the uk at this point in time due to its connections and alliances is better off than any other european country . 
  it is not arrogance . 
  it is power politics . 
  as british lord palmsterson said * `` as the eternal ally or the perpetual enemy of england . 
  we have no eternal allies , and we have no perpetual enemies . 
  our interests are eternal and perpetual , and those interests it is our duty to follow . 
  '' * can the eu * in matters of power and influnce * become the china of western eurasia ? 
  at the moment it is not . 
  nothing happens unless the us says so . 
   so are france and there are always temporary memberships as well france is strong too . 
  when it comes to influence aboard france probably comes second to the uk . 
  especially in affairds regarding africa . 
   for the moment at least economies have their ups and downs . 
  since the 80s the uk has been transformed into one of the greatest economies on the planet . 
  not to mention the influence of london and the city on the economy . 
   i 'd argue our military is on a par with european countries not really . 
  the uk is up there with france and russia when it comes to military might . 
  the rest of europe has a long way to go . 
   considering who 's leading that country at the moment , this might not be a good thing !, 
  does n't really matter . 
  a president alone ca n't change much . 
  this is the beauty of the us system . 
  there is the senate , the house , the supreme court , other federal courts etc. 
  the famous `` gridlock '' prevents fast , radical and poorly thought out policies to see the light of the day . 
   true but i 'm certain that the eu has similar institutions and the uk shares security info with the eu anyway , which i very much hope will continue . 
  since the eu is not a federal state intelligence services act on their own for their own interests . 
  when states share intelligence of course they do n't reveal their whole catch . 
  the intelligence system of the anglosphere countries is top notch . 
  camillo benso is one of the greatest statemen italy has ever produced . 
  if not the greatest . 
   the greek coast guard fired bullets at a turkey-flagged freighter in the aegean sea on july 3 ** after it refused to obey calls from the greek authorities to stop at a greek port **  greek coast guard boats fired shots on the ship around ** three miles off the island of rhodes **  ** greek coast guard instructed him to approach the rhodes port in international waters but he refused to obey the call ** and briefed the turkish side of the situation . 
  borders is a concept foreign and probably unknown to turkish policy . 
   the only obstacle i see for us joining the eu is greece where does this come from ? 
  greece not only supports albania in the eu but it also support turkey . 
  even the conservative party supports these positions . 
  stable borders via the eu . 
   there is no debate about the fact that a large population of muslim albanians were expropriated and expelled from greece after the second world war . 
  as far as i know this is not denied by greece . 
  it is a fact . 
  they collaborated with nazis against local greeks . 
   that being said , the cham issue is not about territorial expansion but about minority rights the thing is , there is no issue . 
  there is no reason for some people in albania to bring it up . 
  it only creates a passive aggressive situation that does n't help in any way , shape or form . 
  as i said earlier only turkey talks about it as if it is an issue . 
  that speaks for itself . 
   the greek governments before the crisis publicly supported political groups in south albanian villages that would raise greek flags over government institutions ( like municipalities ) . 
  greeks flag may fly at greek school for instance . 
  greeks lived there for many many years and they are allowed to have their own institution like churches etc. 
  at this within the limits of the law of course . 
  greeks are the biggest ethnic minority in albania because of that . 
  they are * officialy recognized * and their rights are protected by international law . 
  also everytime albanian ultranationalists harash greek people in the south or take down greek flags the albanian authorities usually condemn these actions . 
  nothing wrong with that . 
  it is not like the greek state support autonomy for south albania . 
  this position was dropped long ago after the short lived autonomous republic of northern epirus . 
  ever since 1995-1996 relations have been improving . 
  there is a small group of albanians though that finds an easy target at greeks at the south mainly because greece has n't recognized kosovo yet .
