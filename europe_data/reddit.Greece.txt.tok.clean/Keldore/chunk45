  one can only find yildirim 's statement funny . 
   seeking to contain a recent escalation of tensions in the aegean , greek prime minister alexis tsipras and his turkish counterpart binali yildirim agreed to ** keep the lines of communication between athens and ankara open ** . 
   appearing eager to bottle the genie of confrontation , both men stressed the benefits of good neighborly relations between the two nato allies . 
  in a joint press conference , tsipras urged turkey to put an end to airspace violations over the aegean . 
  `` i stressed to mr yildirim that this situation is n't helping at all and that these infringements can not continue as they increase the risk of an accident , '' the greek premier said . 
  * yildirim , however , added that violations were `` not one-sided . 
  * '' ~ ~ yildirim , however , added that violations were `` not one-sided . '' ( lol ) ~ ~  for his part , yildirim expressed dismay at the eu 's stance towards turkey 's referendum to revise its constitution , and said there a reset in relations with brussels was needed . 
   with regard to cyprus , yildirim admitted that a solution may take time but insisted that there must be cooperation in regard to energy resources off the island 's coast . 
  ** turkey has threatened cyprus ** not to go ahead with gas exploration and drilling . 
  can confirm . 
  take a look at [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggzlug0wguc ) the amount of socialists here in greece who believe that the ussr was heaven on earth is absurd . 
  i had a communist tell me yesterday that during the stalin era there was no shortage of food , no homelessness , zero unemployment and that this great utopia was brought down by capitalist imperialists that wanted to control the people via market tyranny . 
  in greece we say that `` the left lost the war ( civil war ) , but won the battle of ideas '' . 
  even the `` conservative '' party bought into the socialist myth . 
  nationalizing industries , embracing strong unions , expanding the welfare state etc. 
  there is no love for the market , there is no love for law and order and sometimes there is no love for democracy . 
  even before the crisis that was the case . 
  radical left wing ideals became part of our society . 
  during the pasok years in the 80s socialism became the synomymous of what a pure man preaches . 
  now that syriza is in power though this `` pure left wing against the evil capitalists '' myth is being demolished . 
  reality knocked on our door . 
  no because `` new '' is something that has nothing to do with the `` old '' . 
  totally different entities . 
  it is not part of the old . 
  it is something new . 
  which in reality the fyr is . 
  yet there is no rule about this . 
  slavs in a sense are not locals of macedonia . 
   ` new ' macedonia suggests that there is no link whatsoever with the wider geographical region of macedonia . 
  it still says macedonia . 
  the `` new '' goes for the national concept . 
  you understand that the argument is not about geography right ? 
  of course bitola and skopje and in macedonia geographically . 
  no one argues that . 
  so is pella and thessaloniki . 
  the argument comes down to the national concept and the hijacking of greek history . 
  something that in the long run can lead to problems as we saw earlier this year with vmro people chanting about `` liberating macedonia from the greeks '' . 
   the republic of macedonia definitely follows on from an existing concept of ` macedonia ' no . 
  there was no national concept of macedonia . 
  i do n't know where did you pulled the `` existing concept '' out from but historically it is baseless . 
  the decision will be bilateral . 
  what was promoted or not in either country is n't really of importance . 
  we are looking for a solution to possible irredentist problems that may arise . 
  this is why in my opinion nova makedonija is the better solution . 
  who is going to guarantee that in the future the geographical designation such as north wont be used in order to promote propaganda like `` liberate the south '' ? 
  let 's be conservative here . 
  untill we see actual legislation we should n't assume anything . 
  if the name dispute is to come to end i am rooting for the name new macedonia . 
  it is the best solution for many reasons . 
  firstly it is geographical . 
  it indicates that the country is in macedonia . 
  secondly is indicates that they have nothing to do with old macedonia and greek history . 
  the same way new zealand is not zealand , the same way new york is not york . 
  lastly it sounds good in their language ( nova makedonija ) . 
  new macedonia is better . 
  it distinquises them from the actual macedonian history . 
  the same way york is not new york . 
  northern macedonia may imply for some circles that `` south macedonia is under occupation '', 
  he got us . 
  we used our ancient greek alien technology that was also used to defeat the persians in order to cause this earthquake . 
  we are lucky that he did n't see us parking our spaceships in our secret hellenic compound under the parthenon . 
  next time we should be more careful and use the stealth zeusian mothership that we hide in the clouds above mt. 
  olympus . 
  in international politics it is pretty common to use the capital 's name since that is the place were decisions are made . 
  the same way we say `` washington 's proposals to ... '' . 
   greece asked us to change the flag do you know what that flag was ? 
  how can you say there were no efforts to make connections with alexander and then tell me about that flag ? 
  there is something missing here . 
   mentioned stuff like ` we are the descendants of alexander ' before 2008 how old are you ? 
  because i remember talks about skopjians being descendants of alexander even back in the 90s . 
  gligorov then made a statement saying ( and i am paraphrasing of course ) `` we are slavs . 
  we have nothing to do with alexander '' . 
  it was n't long after that that things started going downhill . 
   regardless of what they do or say no ? 
  i blamed the vmro and its nationalist goons for promoting irredentist and expansionist propaganda . 
  i welcome change from the government of skopje . 
  a kremlin tied group in their country started this nationalist circus . 
  changing it would be welcome . 
  please explain . 
  because as far as i know people usually call me a neoliberal internationalist . 
  not a nationalist . 
  wanting to prevent nationalists from taking over the region and in the long run cause territorial disputes is a pretty normal concern . 
  they do n't have the power to do anything to greece at this point in time . 
  why leave a wound bleeding though ? 
  i prefer a solution that will leave no ground for nationalist mumbo jumbo in the long run . 
  this is the balkans . 
  extremists , paramilitary organizations , ultranationalists etc. 
  has great influence . 
  there is no need for official statements in order for events to occur . 
  the vmro only needs to promote a certain kind of rhetoric in order to mobilize people . 
   english , scottish , welsh and northern irish are not . 
  scottish is not a nationality ? 
  you just angered over 5 million people . 
   are these nationalists in power or likely to be in power ? 
  are they are an official political party that has made territorial claims of greek land an official position ? 
  yes they were . 
  the vmro . 
   or are they just a small group of nutcases who occasionally have a rally that most of the population does n't care about ? 
  nope . 
  the vmro is strong in that country and is known to have ties with the kremlin .
