  he retired from active politics in 2004 but remained honorary chairman of the center-right new democracy party . 
   born in the port of hania on the southern greek island of crete on oct. 18 , 1918 , ** mitsotakis was the nephew of liberal statesman eleftherios venizelos ** and was first elected to parliament as a member of that party in 1946 . 
   even old-time conservative barons , many of whom thought of mitsotakis as an interloper and never fully accepted him as one of their own , thought he was the only one who could successfully confront papandreou , a popular and gifted orator . 
   his administration was marked by a dispute with neighboring macedonia over the newly independent country 's name and by large-scale union and student protests against his free market and education reforms . 
   mitsotakis ' eldest daughter , dora bakoyannis was mayor of athens during the 2004 olympic games and later was foreign minister in 2006-2009 in a new democracy government . 
  her husband , pavlos bakoyannis , a conservative politician , was shot to death in 1989 by members of the far-left greek terrorist group november 17 . 
   mitsotakis , who enjoyed good health until late in life , also lived long enough to see his youngest child and only son , kyriakos , elected as leader of new democracy in january 2016 . 
  fun fact : he was the third oldest state leader in the world following vietnamese \u0110\u1ed7 m\u01b0\u1eddi and japanese yasuhiro nakasone, 
   am i wrong to say it failed ? 
  yes . 
  our economic problems have their roots in our spendaholic state and corrupt relationships between the voters and the political class  the book seems to be about the nato , rather than the e.u. , not that i like the nato more . 
  and it does n't look trustworthy to me , as it refers to the september 11 `` terror attacks '' . 
  looks like propaganda , to be honest . 
  actually kaskarelis is a well established diplomat for the greek state . 
  the book while focusing on nato has great info regarding the greek defence strategy in the european and greater order . 
  trust me it is worth reading . 
   i understand the fear of an aggressive turkey , i would have called you a bit paranoid only a few years ago , however the recent rhetoric and actions of the government of turkey does indeed concern not just greece many others as well the thing is that to us who follow the turkish situation closely for years the problem is not just the current government . 
  the kemalists were the architects of aggressions in the aegean . 
  the islamists followed . 
  and even today the kemalists pander to nationalists in order to maintain a strong base . 
  when your choices are turkish nationalists or islamists the future seems bleak . 
  i would love to see a european turkey . 
  that would be beneficial for both turkey and greece . 
  but let 's not kid ourselves . 
  there needs to be a movement in turkey that will replace the old political guard . 
  mainly the kemalists/nationalists and the islamists . 
   we were not isolated before that . 
  we still traded with other countries , european or not . 
  that is true . 
  but in the long run international trade deals concerning the eu as a block have other benefits . 
  mainly involving many nations as a trading block instead of negotiating independently . 
  it simplifies the negotiating process for many parties making it easier for more to get involved . 
  the defence argument though is way more important than the economic one . 
   what does that even mean ? 
  and who were our immidiate allies ? 
  this is way to complicated to analyze on a reddit comment . 
  i can point you [ here ] ( http://www.metaixmio.gr/products/3621--11-.aspx ) though . 
  an insightful book written by insider , vassilis kaskarelis . 
  access to a bigger market , easier movement of goods and labor etc. 
  and later a voice at the european geopolitical and defence table , a say in policy making concerning our immediate allies and partners in the region and globally etc. 
  greece signing this was a tremendous win . 
  if you are looking for the cause of our financial adventures do n't look for european scapegoats . 
  the answer lies elsewhere . 
  the [ treaty of accession 1979 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_accession_1979 ) was the agreement between the european communities and greece , concerning this country 's accession into the ec . 
  it entered into force on 1 january 1981 . 
  the treaty arranged accession of greece to the ec and amended earlier treaties of the european communities . 
  as such it is an integral part of the constitutional basis of the european union the full official name of the treaty is :  ** treaty ** between the kingdom of belgium , the kingdom of denmark , the federal republic of germany , the french republic , ireland , the italian republic , the grand duchy of luxembourg , the kingdom of the netherlands , the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland ( member states of the european communities ) and the hellenic republic ** concerning the accession of the hellenic republic to the european economic community and to the european atomic enegry community . 
  the hellenic navy and greek naval warfare in general are a pretty interesting part of greek history . 
  the [ greek merchant fleet ] ( https://imgur.com/a/ai2fe ) is impressive too . 
  very impressive actually . 
  it provides many many jobs , even for low skilled workers , for high wages . 
  a lot of people during these crisis years have turned to the sea . 
  forget about the soviet union . 
  this guy is also responsible for doing more damage than good in the middle east , the far east and the balkans . 
  if it was n't for kissinger and his policy of detente and opening to china , brzezinski would have wrecked a whole hemisphere . 
  thankfuly george shultz cleaned up the mess . 
  of course . 
  right wing means love for terrorism , mass shootings and stealing lollipops from babies . ^ ^ / s they do n't even have to read what i write . 
  yeap , instant downvote and reply calling him heartless and corrupt '' . 
  but they attacking me is of little importance . 
  what matters is the following . 
  these terrorist acts are troubling for sure . 
  what is more troubling though is the support they get from a big chunk of the population . 
  the `` aganaktismenoi '' mob . 
  these people are not a new phenomenon . 
  all the `` burn down the whorehouse '' , `` lynch the pm '' , `` kick out the merkelites '' rhetoric lead to this . 
  if greece is to move forward these people need to be defeated culturally . 
  their kind of rhetoric is what killed capodistrias and king george i. 
  it is also what nearly killed venizelos and papademos today . 
  edit : typo, 
  this `` cancer '' of a user though did n't do anything you accused him of . 
  specifically call for `` more people to die '' , or `` wish for tsipras to die '' . 
  on the contraty the first thing i did was to [ condemn ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/greece/comments/6dai4y/%cf%84%cf%81%ce%bf%ce%bc%ce%bf%ce%ba%cf%81%ce%ac%cf%84%ce%b5%cf%82_%ce%b1%ce%bd%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%af%ce%bd%ce%b1%ce%be%ce%b1%ce%bd_%cf%84%ce%bf_%ce%b1%cf%85%cf%84%ce%bf%ce%ba%ce%af%ce%bd%ce%b7%cf%84%ce%bf_%cf%84%ce%bf%cf%85_%cf%80%ce%b1%cf%80%ce%b1%ce%b4%ce%ae%ce%bc%ce%bf%cf%85/di19xr2/?context=3 ) both the attack and those wishing the same to happen to tsipras . 
  you painted me in your head as a bloodthirsty guy just because we probably disagree on some issues . 
  that is why i called you biased . 
  just because the left did n't turn out to be what you were dreaming about that does n't make tsipras less of a leftist . 
  i am openly libertarian and conservative . 
  that does n't make me biased . 
  i am all for giving credit where its due and condemning even people with the same ideology as me when needed . 
  i condemned the attack and both those who wished similar events to happen to our current left wing pm . 
  there are several left wing terrorist organizations in greece . 
  they were active even before the crisis . 
   the vocal majority of this sub is very conservative ...  i expect some sick fucks to wish for more people to die ...  this subreddit is cancer !, 
  yea you do n't sound biased at all . 
  still more functional than our parliamentary `` 6 pms in 7 years '' mumbo jumbo . 
  yea compare those minor things to the instability of our parliamentary system . 
  since 2010 we had 6 pms . 
  and we are talking about a time that requires stability because of the complexity the negotiations . 
  not to mention all the laws that come and go because of these government changes . 
  actually it is extremely functional . 
  hate speech laws are dangerous . 
  europe needs a 1st amendment . 
  not hate speech laws . 
  all these things add positive points to his resume . 
  except the following two lies :  who gifted him very expensive equipment , in exchange for goverment funds courts say otherwise . 
   appointed someone who was part of the far far right as a vp for his party . 
  far right ? 
  point me to his far right positions . 
  he has a jewish pr working with him , is a hardcore pro-israel guy , is pro-eu , is pro-usa , is pro-free markets etc. 
  he is a conservative .
