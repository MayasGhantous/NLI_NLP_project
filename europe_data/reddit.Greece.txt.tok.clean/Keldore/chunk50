  you are either drunk or incapable of reading clearly . 
   these are all examples about freelancer not businesses i said businessmen not businesses . 
   they do n't show that they pay 70 % tax on their income . 
  it clearly shows that in the article given . 
  it includes income tax , end vocation , solidarity contribution , social security and taxes in advance . 
   besides this we all know that professionals will rarely report a huge profit since it 's very easy to deduct costs . 
  a businessman and a freelancer get taxes from the first euro they make . 
   it has nothing to do with businesses . 
  it 's freelancers . 
  i never said anything about businesses . 
  i did n't even include corporate taxes in the article given . 
  you are way too biased and you are looking for confirmation of your already established view instead of looking at what i give you . 
  what this incluedes is social security tax , end vocation , income tax , `` solidarity contribution '' and taxes in advance . 
  vat for instance is not includes . 
  that is what you pay when you go shopping with what is left so to speak . 
  what the 45 % rate is , is just income tax . 
  i clearly said `` income taxes , property taxes , social security etc. '', 
  [ here ] ( http://www.imerisia.gr/article.asp?catid=27686&amp;subid=2&amp;pubid=114001512 ) are examples once again . 
  feel free to translate . 
  paying 70 % of your income does n't mean you pay 70 % income tax . 
  i though that was obvious . 
  if you are not lazy translate [ this ] ( http://www.imerisia.gr/article.asp?catid=27686&amp;subid=2&amp;pubid=114001512 ) . 
  there are examples with people making 12k up to 50k . 
  you certainly are an angry individual . 
  is cnn more credible than me ? 
  if yes then have a look [ here ] ( http://www.cnn.gr/oikonomia/story/61085/se-foroys-kai-eisfores-to-70-toy-eisodimatos ) i can point you to many articles . 
  have a look [ here ] ( http://www.imerisia.gr/article.asp?catid=27686&amp;subid=2&amp;pubid=114001512 ) . 
  that are numbers inside . 
  if you are not lazy like me translate it . 
  your name sure does n't lie ... do you trust cnn more than me ? 
  because if that is the case have a look [ here ] ( http://www.cnn.gr/oikonomia/story/61085/se-foroys-kai-eisfores-to-70-toy-eisodimatos ) . 
  i assume you know how to translate an article . 
  they just accuse him of being privilaged because his father was pm during the early 90s . 
  all the corruption allegations are baseless and over the years this has been proved in court . 
  when he became president of the party he appointed two vps . 
  one liberal and one conservative . 
  they accuse him of appointing `` far right '' people as vps because in their mind what is not centrist or leftist is automatically far right . 
  there is no in between . 
  just because he was born the son of a pm that means he can never become pm himself ? 
  he is more than capable and this is why he has enlarged the party . 
  how old are you ? 
  have you ever paid taxes ? 
  what i am saying is pretty clear . 
  you are a businessman . 
  you make 1000 euros . 
  out of these 1000 euros 700 euros goes to the government . 
  income taxes , property taxes , social security etc. 
  aggregate taxation . 
  at the end of the month you are left with 300 for other expenses such as food , gas etc. 
   ( income taxes , property taxes , social security etc. ) . 
  total sum of taxes is 70 % from the first euro a businessman makes . 
  things change . 
  he has already shown signs of changing the party . 
   god-fearing clientelistic party [ here . 
  ] ( http://www.iefimerida.gr/news/319535/me-entoli-mitsotaki-oi-voyleytes-apesyran-tin-ypografi-toys-gia-tama-toy-ethnoys#axzz4hyy0umrc ) the media is preoccupied with our governments negotiation at the moment so we may miss changes that happen in nd . 
  the `` old guard '' is no longer in power . 
  70 % total taxation . 
  not just income . 
  this is why the party had elections . 
  in order to change the leadership and the important members . 
  do n't get me wrong . 
  if the party was under the previous leadership i would n't support it either . 
  but things change . 
  i do n't think we will see early elections . 
  but then again you never know . 
  there is n't really a stable political enviroment during these last decade . 
  til : the word `` eejit '', 
   said no one ever . 
  think again . 
  he is completely dominating every poll at the moment . 
  he has both the right vote and the centrist vote . 
  but we will have to wait for the elections for a more clear view . 
  polls in greece failed miserably at portraiting the actual picture during the last years . 
  he has an incredible resume from years of experience in the private sector and he has many connection even in the imf . 
  when i say it is him or bust it is really him or bust . 
  the center right party had its primaries some time ago . 
  it elected a free market liberal . 
  think of him as a mixture of macron and thatcher . 
  if he wo n't do it , i do n't know who will . 
  i only brought up the two great liberal parties in belgium . 
  for some weird reason you seem to imply that all other parties in belgium favor the government taking half of your income . 
  even social democrats are past this . 
  there is a plethora of parties in belgium . 
  the vld and the mr tend to favor lower taxes . 
  and these are not small parties . 
   we gladly * you * gladly . 
  you ca n't talk for everyone . 
  what kind of generalization is this ? 
   who the fuck would pay 50 % of their salary greek businessmen pay ** 70 % ** of their income to the government ( income taxes , property taxes , social security etc. ) . 
  out of every euro i make the government takes 70 cents . 
  unsustainable and immoral . 
   ultimately the government needs to give greeks a reason to pay taxes no private sector jobs , no taxes . 
  high taxes , no private sector jobs . 
  greece needs radical tax cuts and excessive deregulation . 
  in case you did n't read what was posted above ( which you did n't ) :  the united states again ** urges ** the government of hungary to suspend implementation of its amended higher education law  the * u.s. government * has ** no authority or intention ** to enter into negotiations on the operation of central european university or other universities in hungary . 
  nope . 
  corbyn argues for policies that are far on the left . 
  no country in europe argues or votes for such nonsense . 
  here are some key points of the corbyn manifesto : - scrap tuition fees at all universities in england - nationalise rail firms across the uk - nationalise water energy firms in england - take the royal mail back into public ownership - boost wages of 5.7 million people earning less than the living wage to # 10 an hour by 2020 not only these policies would greatly enlarge the state ( and taxes of courses ) but it would also leave low skilled workers out of work . 
  take the `` boost wages '' point .
