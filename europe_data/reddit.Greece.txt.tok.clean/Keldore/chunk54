  and this is how we rank the weimar republic . 
  manfred weber , the leader of the epp , called out tsipras for being a communist some days ago and all hell broke loose . 
  he said `` as an epp politician i have to say that the problem of greece is that they now have a communist in the office of pm . 
  [ ... ] that was the fundamental problem there . '', 
   the 1848 revolution and constitution as well as the empire 's slow but steady parliamentarisation and democratisation sure . 
  but lone events do n't constitute a tradition . 
  this is my main point . 
   the weimar republic being a `` failed experiment '' is an unfortunate myth that is still being perpetuated while the idea of a republic and liberalism in general in germany was a move forward the whole experiment came crushing down for a reason . 
  a hitler would n't be able to achieve what he did in an actual functioning democratic state like the uk for instance . 
  take a look at what happened to oswald mosley . 
  the syriza party won the elections because it played the `` pure leftist '' card . 
  they had slogans such as `` first time , left wing '' , `` ethical supremacy of the left '' , `` the people will never forget what right wing means '' etc. 
  i mean they really portaited themselves as `` good left wing revolutionaries of the people that fight bad right wing merkelites '' now that they are failing this whole left wing myth is being demolished . 
  i really hope that they grow out of their infantile views and move closer to the center but something deep inside of me tells me that when they go back at being the opposition they will find a new myth to promote . 
  our socialist pm even attented fidel castro 's funeral and praised that butcher as a hero . 
  another minister said that he is a proud communist ever since he was 15 years old . 
  some ex-ministers appointed by the current pm used to refer to saint petersburg as leningrad . 
  i mean , hell , there is even a party in parliament that glorifies even the stalin regime . 
  such a low point for my country ... 
  pre war germany was n't really a well functioning democracy . 
  not to mention that there was no `` democratic tradition '' . 
  pre-weimar germany was pretty traditionalist and borderline authoritarian . 
  past-weimar germany was straight up national socialist . 
  and weimar republic itself was a pretty failed experiment . 
  it is only after wwii that germany starts to develop a democratic tradition . 
  there is a good side to this . 
  most eastern europeans now understand the horrors and degeneracy that socialism causes and wo n't fall for it again . 
  in greece where we did n't experience late stage socialism the whole concept is glorified . 
  there are literally people ( even in government at the moment . 
  many ministers proudly identify as communists ) that will tell you that the soviet countries were the pinnacle of civilization . 
   there probably is no other german party we have so much to thank for in terms of fostering german democratic tradition . 
  modern germany is really a cdu thing . 
  after the war up untill 69 the cdu layed all the foundations for a democratic tradition . 
  the spd did n't even win anything untill the 70s . 
  radical socialism was never reasonable . 
  it was outlawed in many countries . 
  even in germany if i am not mistaken . 
  and in order to draw socialists away from radical movements bismarck passed welfare laws . 
  both philipp and karl were members of the spd . 
  and i would n't call advocating for `` moderately democratic republic '' democratic . 
  they have changed since then ? 
  yea sure . 
  but it is certainly a party that has flirted with left wing extremism in the past . 
  from your article :  from the chambers berlin 's reichstag , or parliament , ** philipp scheidemann ** proclaimed a ** moderately democratic ** republic , while ** karl liebknecht ** called for a ** `` socialist-communist '' germany ** . 
   actually the early communists expected the proletarian revolution to originate in germany because of this . 
  and this is contradictory to the claim of the world 's first '' * democratic * '' party . 
   every party has its foundational myth and the spd claims to be the world 's oldest democratic party . 
   well-written history of this quite influential party in germany and maybe even worldwide . 
  the conservatives in the uk and the democratic party in the us are older than the spd and certainly far more influential . 
  selling bacon to those who eat it . 
  profits rollin ' in . 
   `` wealthy french remove assets to london/usa/etc '' hollande wanting to tax the rich out of existance did n't help also . 
  remember that `` great idea '' about that 75 % tax rate ? 
  not so great after all . 
  back in 2010 they did pretty good . 
  after them getting destroyed their vote did n't really affect the tories . 
  so what i am saying is that there is room for them to regain votes now that a socialist ding dong man like corbyn is leading labour . 
  not even his own party likes him . 
  it is not about them winning . 
  it is about them getting votes from labour . 
  social democratic parties are collapsing all over europe . 
  this is a good chance for liberals to reclaim some of their past power . 
  now that labour is lead by a lunatic left wing extremist it is time for the lib dems to pick up some votes . 
  i remember travelling with turkish airlines . 
  there were `` no pork '' signs on the menu . 
  we need to upgrade the greek aegean airlines and include `` pork tornado '' menus . 
  good . 
  social democrats had their 15 minutes . 
  this plus western russia . 
   how long does it take to review a case in greece ? 
  almost a decade for vatopaidi and the siemens one is still going on . 
  papantoniou is being checked for crimes that happened 17 years ago . 
  as i said . 
  the problem is that it is slow . 
   the turkish thing was not a corruption case . 
  again . 
  it either works or it does n't . 
   and everyone involved got away free . 
  the court came to the conclusion that people involved did nothing wrong . 
  `` got away '' implies that they did something wrong . 
  which they did n't . 
  if you have * evidence * proving otherwise you can inform the courts . 
   i do n't see any reason why we have to wait for 10 years to get a result on corruption cases . 
  because corruption cases often start from accusations and for a case to come to end you need crystal clear evidence . 
  as you already know i suppose greeks pull the trigger very fast . 
  it is very easy for someone to accuse another greek for something even without evidence . 
  remember what the lying minister polakis said about mrs. manolidou in parliament regarding corruption ? 
  when georgiades asked him to prove this in court he refused to go to court with the excuse `` i am a minister i have more serious things to do '', 
  we ca n't go around cherrypicking . 
  our judicial system is not broken . 
  on the one hand we praise it for not returning the turks who escaped erdogan and on the other we bash it for other cases . 
  for instance you mention vatopaidi . 
  it is a closed case . 
  it has been proven at court that it was false accusations . 
  the siemens and other cases are still ongoing if i am not mistaken . 
  this is the problem with our judicial system . 
  it is slow . 
  they compared the fact that reagan was seen as the `` outsider '' . 
  he was a goldwater guy afterall . 
  the nixon/rockefeller establishment were for h.w.
