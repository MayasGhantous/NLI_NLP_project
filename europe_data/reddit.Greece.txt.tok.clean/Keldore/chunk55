  bush . 
  ( reagan in the end chose him as his vp ) reagan was defeated in the 76 primaries by moderate/rockefeller republican ford . 
  reagan was seen as a guy that would lead the us to war etc. 
  sounds familiar ? 
  as far as characters go i do n't really think we can compare reagan and trump . 
  reagan for a great communicator and had great charisma . 
  he was an actor after all . 
  trump does n't have such charisma . 
  both are interesting characters but reagan was one of a kind . 
  he had [ many great jokes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ha7sp47e8ta ) . 
  the soviet jokes were top notch . 
  `` we are going to take the facts that we find and we are going to apply the law as it 's been set out by the supreme court and other courts and we 'll take the appropriate action '' so they will do nothing because there is nothing illegal here . 
  they just had to make an announcment because of many complaints . 
  why thank him for the obvious ? 
  this is the west . 
  we can afford to make fun of our leaders . 
  anyway this reminded me of this funny [ reagan joke ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d46kugmymrq ), 
  well we on the right ca n't feel much symphathy for syriza too but let 's be real . 
  uncompromising and sometimes irrational opposition benefits no one . 
  at the end of the day we sail on the same ship . 
   90 % of them are legitimate criminals and should be treated as such . 
  i agree that * proven * criminals should be treated as such . 
  one would say the smaller far right and left people have gathered around him because it is their only chance at sitting at the governing table . 
  if he wants to really unite the biggest part of the population he will have to stop going so hard against new democracy and other past governments . 
  his rhetoric remains extreme compared to the more moderate liberal conservative voices in parliament . 
  a more business friendly language would attract more people from the right and it would be a hypocrisy not to change to such rhetoric . 
  he is no longer a communist ( at least in practice ) . 
  since he moves on with investment he should adopt a more inclusive language . 
  he has a strong mandate . 
   tsipras is becoming a very good leader what ? ... 
  how can a `` good leader '' appoint ministers like polakis or koniordou ? 
  how can a `` good leader '' support the brutal regime in venezuela and attent dictator castro 's funeral ( the only western pm that went there btw was him ) ? 
  sure i 'll give him credit for moving faster with some privatizations than the previous governments but he still has a long way to go . 
  he can start by admitting his past mistakes and renouncing his uncompromising stance against pm samaras . 
  it wo n't be long untill he goes back at being opposition leader . 
  can you imagine him playing the `` revolutionary '' like he did before ? 
  we would have made no progress at all . 
  nice . 
  this one is actually pretty amazing . 
  there are people who think beyond party politics . 
  jacob rees-mogg explains my point perfectly [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvecyc3k9a8 ), 
  so only leftists can criticize the left ? 
  a well functioning left and right benefits a democracy . 
   even if the moderates could somehow recover control of the party -- with its brand , its title and , not least , its trade union links -- the problem would remain . 
  these are not friendly times for parties of the traditional left . 
  it is often pointed out that , of the eight men who have led labour over the past 40 years , seven failed to win a general election . 
  but the decline of the established left is a europe-wide phenomenon . 
  the french socialists came fifth in the recent presidential election , with 6.4 per cent ; the dutch labour party seventh in the general election with 5.7 per cent . 
   a new force will eventually emerge on the british left . 
  in this , as in any country , a chunk of the electorate is looking for a party that stands , essentially , for an activist state . 
  but it now seems all but certain that that party wo n't be labour . 
  wait what ? 
  where do i even say anything about the value of the new testament ? 
  i am not even religious ... 
  i am just pointing out that there is tremendous antisemetism in the quran . 
  antisemetism that leads to the leader of hezbollah to say `` if jews all gather in israel , it will save us the trouble of going after them worldwide . '' . 
   perhaps you could go on by quoting the rest of the mentions of jews in that article this is why i linked it . 
  so i wo n't have to write down every single jew reference . 
  do n't be lazy . 
   quote the bible and torah on the subject of heresy and apostasy feel free to point me to passages in the bible or more specifically the new testament which is the base for most modern christianity that include similar passage like the ones in the quran . 
  passages like `` we aid the believers against their enemy '' and `` invode death '' and `` kill the jew behind me '' . 
  how about : `` wherefore for the iniquity of those who are ** jews ** did ** we disallow to them the good things ** which had been made lawful for them and for their hindering many ( people ) from allah 's way '' `` o you who believe !, 
  ** do not take the jews and the christians for friends ** ; they are friends of each other ; and whoever amongst you takes them for a friend , then surely he is one of them '' `` so a party of the children of israel believed and another party disbelieved ; then ** we aided those who believed against their enemy , and they became uppermost . 
  ** '' `` o you who are jews , if you think that you are the favorites of allah to the exclusion of other people , ** then invoke death if you are truthful ** '' do i need to go on ? 
  how is it not antisemetic to prejudge a whole group of people and say `` they are cursed and they have brought this to themselves '' or that `` they are enemies of allah '' with whatever this comes with ? 
  besides talking generally about `` enemies of allah '' it specifically calls out the jews . 
  seriously ? 
  have you read the quran ? 
  [ there are ] ( http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/references-to-jews-in-the-koran ) many negative passages against the jews . 
  can you read ? 
  do i need to rephrase something in order for you to understand it ? 
  i have never said anything like `` men are more skillful than women '' . 
  what i say is this . 
  let 's suppose you have to make a 10 people ballot . 
  and you have to pick from a pool of 20 people . 
  and let 's suppose that out of these 20 people we have 15 women and 5 men . 
  now let 's suppose that out of the 15 women 8 women are great politicians , 2 are above average and the rest are bad . 
  also all 5 men are bad politicians . 
  would you go for a 5-5 ballot or a 10 woman ballot ? 
  i would go with 10 women . 
  because of skill . 
  simple as that . 
  no gender involved . 
  an inequality that has no effect on anything . 
  why `` correct '' it ? 
  inequality is not necessarily a bad thing . 
  people tend to make different choices . 
  in their personal lives yes it does . 
  it does n't matter to us who elect them though . 
  because men get more involved . 
  men and women do n't make the same choices . 
  why do you feel the need to make the distinction between men and women at a position that their gender does not matter ? 
  what would change if it was 50-50 or 80-20 or 20-80 ? 
  nothing . 
  it is all about policy . 
  nothing to do with gender . 
  we do n't elect communities or minorities or any category or people . 
  we elect local representantives to represent us nationaly . 
  whoever does that better , man or woman , gets the positions . 
  it is not rocket science .
