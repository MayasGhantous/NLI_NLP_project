  at odds with jeffersonian and individualist values of the americans . 
   you deny the fact that sampson massacred turks . 
  show me exactly the phrase that i used that denies the actions of sampson . 
  i am waiting ... anytime now ...  so you are taking refugee in your `` propaganda '' schtick again . 
  good it ** feels ** satisfying . 
  as i said . 
  you may want to appeal to feelings . 
  that does n't change the fact that as i said there is a reason your state stands alone on this issue . 
  all i am doing is calling a spade a spade . 
  `` who the fuck do you think you are ? 
  '' , `` shamelessness '' , `` overlook all that suffering '' etc. 
  you may try to appeal to feelings all you want . 
  facts are facts and facts do n't change . 
  me trying to explain to you history is of no use . 
  the international community already knows . 
  you may want to live in a bubble of a state that denies genocide , justifies invasion , jails journalists etc. 
  that 's fine . 
  but do n't try and tell me that a state that is willing to do all the above is not trying to portait events in a special way . 
  there is a reason turkey stands alone on this issue . 
  a lot of what you say is completely true . 
  but there is a shady side to the kemalists today i am talking of course about the chp because that is the main kemalist vehicle . 
  the chp exists just because of nationalists . 
  in reality it is a nationalist alternative to an islamist akp . 
  this is why there wo n't be great change with the chp . 
  which let 's be real about this , it had many chances to prove itself in the past . 
  this is why i argue for a new wave in turkish politics . 
  promoted by turkish intellectuals , businessmen etc. 
  there are many turks living outside of turkey that are of great influence and can work in order to achieve such a political movement . 
  i am not going to debate killing with you because you obviously believe * and not challenge * anything that your state tells you . 
  everyone with half a brain understand that in order to go from [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/ethnographic_distribution_in_cyprus_1960.jpg ) ( 1960 , blue greeks ) to [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/population_map_of_cyprus.jpg ) ( greeks living in the island after the invasion ) something terrible must have happened . 
  the turkish invasion was so `` justified '' that * only * and * only * turkey recognises the pseudostate at the north . 
  * not a single un member * besides turkey recognises this farce as legitimate . 
  you may feel good talking into turkish echo chambers about `` evil greeks '' or `` evil armenians '' that somehow threaten your existance but a time will come that you may have to reflect upon the fact that your version of history is only supported by your own state and that state alone . 
  both greeks and turks commited brutal crimes against each other . 
  not to mention sampson commited crimes against other greeks too . 
  that is no excuse for a turkish ivasion and greek population expulsion . 
  and achieving enosis was a pretty legitimate goal at the time . 
  greek land historically , with a huge greek majority as a population and greek struggles in order to remove the english from the island . 
  years and years of anti-colonial struggle from greeks against the british . 
  only in 1957 out of the blue kucuk started talking about dividing the island . 
  greeks were trying to topple greeks and that somehow threatened turkey ? 
  yea right . 
  [ here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/cyprus_1973_ethnic_neutral.svg ) is a map of cyprus in 1973 . 
  yellow is greek . 
  purple are turks . 
  kemalists just used a putin-like excuse similar to the one in ukraine in order to invade . 
  kemalists were the original putins . 
  and unlike ukraine the kemalists expelled greeks from their homes , destroyed their churches and homes and brough in population from turkey in order to turkify the land . 
  no excuse for such behavior . 
   how can a new wave of politics come about if erdogan jails the opposition , journalists , even common people who do n't like him ? 
  so are you really saying that it is erdogan or nothing at this point ? 
  even in putin 's regime there is opposition . 
  i know they do n't get a fair deal but it is better than nothing . 
  how about something that does n't involve figures ? 
  turkey needs a new wave in politics . 
  not worshipping figures of the past . 
  not looking for `` lost legacies '' . 
  not waiting for a messiah to save them . 
  i know many will hate this but here it is . 
  worshipping a century old figure ... kemalists are stuck in the past . 
  they are as regressive as the erdoganists are in a lot of ways . 
  they pander to nationalists in order to be relevant . 
  the invasion of cyprus happened under kemalist leadership . 
  kemal was a pretty important figure was his time . 
  worshipping kemal though and looking for answers in what we call kemalism today is not going to lead to any solutions . 
  if turkey wants a strong liberal opposition it needs to look for something new . 
   bitola is part of ancient macedonia , the region was called macedonia forever stop the non sense no one says anything about the region . 
  we are talking about nationhood . 
  you have mixed some things up . 
  i too believe that to be true . 
  if i am not mistaken the vmro in skopje has the official support of the kremlin . 
  albanians live on the western side of the country . 
  if that country is to fall it wo n't be given to someone as a whole . 
  i really do n't understand how the vmro thinks they can keep going like this without consequences . 
  do n't they understand realpolitik ? 
  they are weak . 
  unless they have hidden funds and external agencies/states working with them . 
  `` warrior on a horse '' gives me a good laugh everytime . 
  whatever works . 
  as long as there will be no country trying to call itself macedonia i am fine with that . 
  bordering serbia will make many greeks happy though . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/timeline-power-battle-leaves-macedonia-without-government-03-30-2017 ) typical stuff that precede civil wars . 
  really sad . 
  i am not surprised though . 
  that country is extremelly unstable . 
  creating problems with ethnic albanians , stealing greek history , names and symbols , being too nationalistic etc. 
  and all that in the balkans ... not gon na work . 
  trying to hide problems regarding ethnic albanians : check stealing other nation 's history , names and symbols : check being more nationalistic than appropriate * in the balkans * : check yeap . 
  sounds like great disaster . 
  this country is headed into civil war or military rule . 
  maybe it will break up and some parts will go to albania and some others to bulgaria . 
  totally unstable . 
   protesters stormed into macedonia 's parliament and the leader of the social democrats was injured in a ** fistfight ** on thursday after his party and ethnic albanian allies ** voted to elect an albanian as parliament speaker **  live television footage showed zoran zaev with blood trickling from the left side of his forehead , not long after he announced that the majority coalition led by his party had elected talat xhaferi as parliament speaker . 
   xhaferi became the ** first ethnic albanian parliament speaker in macedonia ** since the small balkan country won independence from then-yugoslavia in 1991 . 
   elections were held in december 2016 but ** no government has been formed yet ** , though zaev forged a majority coalition in parliament together with ethnic albanians . 
   ** the claim ** on wednesday ** by a turkish minister that the tiny inhabited greek island of agathonisi in the southeastern aegean was `` turkish '' ** essentially dashed any expectations in athens that ankara would tone down the recent upsurge of its incendiary rhetoric once the historic constitutional referendum in the neighboring country ended 10 days ago . 
   the issue of turkish provocations was discussed by the government council for foreign affairs and defense ( kysea ) convened by by prime minister alexis tsipras on wednesday . 
   soon after , celik 's remarks received a stern written response from the greek foreign ministry , which denounced the `` ongoing revisionist and dangerous conduct on the part of turkey . ''  `` we unequivocally condemn the ongoing revisionist policy of turkey , which issues provocative statements disputing the internationally recognized borders as those were historically defined and established by international law , during the last century . ''  meanwhile , three turkish jets , ** two of which were armed ** , violated greek national air space on wednesday and engaged in two mock dogfights with greek jets . 
   the national review is generally only taken serious by nutjobs where do you pull these out from ? 
  the national review is one of the most respected conservative outlets .
