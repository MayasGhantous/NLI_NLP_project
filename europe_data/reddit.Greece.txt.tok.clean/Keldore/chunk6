  you can find a butter knife in your kitchen . 
  i am pretty sure there are no wmds in your house . 
  i do n't even understand how did you even make the connection between what we are talking about here and wmds . 
  i would appreciate it as a joke but it seems you are serious about it . 
  wmds are not guns . 
  i though that was obvious . 
  do you really believe civilians could obtain and use wmds ? 
  there are * countries * that do n't even have wmds . 
  what are you on about my friend ? 
  talking about some serious leaps in logic ... 
  yea i am pretty sure the guy who lives in a isolated farm away from police reach will be pretty happy about that . 
  oh maybe they will regulate him farm too . 
  force him to own a farm within a police station 's range ... 
  it is from the counsil of the eu channel, 
   guns kill people people kill people . 
  if a person wants to kill someone he can easily use a machette or a butter knife for all i know . 
   it 's wise to regulate them , like a lot of other things that can be dangerous to others , like alcohol , tobacco , pharmaceuticals , motor vehicles yea regulate our bourbon . 
  regulate our cars . 
  people are stupid . 
  they are irresponsible . 
  only a parent like figure like a government bureaucrat is illuminated and responsible enough to put our lives in order eh ? 
  smh, 
  why make the regulations more strict ? 
  why take the guns away from law abiding citizens ? 
  let 's be real . 
  most of these mps are metropolitan social democrats . 
  they live in their own world . 
  i doupt any of them has actually been to a rural area where guns are common . 
  now terrorists wo n't be able to get their hands on these evil guns . 
  oh wait they will . 
  criminals do n't care about laws . 
  priceless . 
   old people playing backgammon everywhere i 've literally seen two very old men playing backgammon in the middle of nowhere . 
  twenty minutes away from the closest city , next to the sea , midsummer , under a tree . 
  i do n't even know how they got there and why did they go there instead of chillin home . 
  but yea ... 
  months ago erdogan said that the treaty of laussane is just a document that is subject to change . 
  just try to imagine what constitutes a disputed area in his head . 
  i want to inform those who do n't know that this is not just erdogan . 
  ozal sent warships in the aegean almost starting a war resulting in us stepping in . 
  ciller threatened to sent turkish troops in athens . 
  we are used to it . 
  this is the turkish national policy in the area . 
  aggressive . 
  it goes beyond governments and cabinets . 
  erdogan just barks louder making the rest of the world aware of this situation . 
  when us president carter was informed about the turkish aggressions in the aegean he was surprised since he believed that cyprus was the only issue . 
  this has been going on for many years . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu_danrc9be ) one is pretty funny . 
  it is about high school countries too . 
  british commonwealth mainly . 
  the painting is called `` the reception of lord byron at missolonghi '', 
  a secular muslim population would soon vote non secular muslims in power . 
  and that happened . 
  there is no protestant islam to go hand in hand with secularism . 
  this is why erdogan is revered in turkey . 
  indeed . 
  remember bismarck trying to kulturkampf ? 
  does n't quite work that way . 
  the people and the state are two different entities . 
  not everyone remembers that . 
   in any case , it seems to me that lately this recent erdo\u011fan adventure has departed from islamism towards classic nationalism . 
  not really . 
  the opposition is the party which usually panders to nationalists in order to win elections . 
  the akp seems more islamist than ever . 
  remember the erdogan saying `` the mosques are our barracks , the domes our helmets , the minarets our bayonets and the faithful our soldiers ... '', 
  not sustainable . 
  they got there by squeezing our pockets brutally hard . 
  the private sector is gasping for air . 
  not to mention they are using our tax money to hire public servants in order to maintain a voter army . 
  if history has taught us anything it 's that this socialist tactic does n't last long . 
   only 12 % of the turkish population want the sharia law i would n't say `` only '' . 
  if 9 to 10 million people wanted sharia in my country i would be concerned . 
  the government changing does n't mean the people change too . 
  kemal tried to push for secularism but the majority of turks remained muslim . 
  islamism too has strong roots in the turkish society and is refueled every now and then but neo-ottomanists . 
  imagine poland passing laws trying to secularize catholics . 
  not gon na happen . 
  it is [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lord_byron ) lord byron . 
  the 6th baron byron, 
  til, 
  they were ottoman subjects . 
  take a look at [ serbs ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/22/paja_jovanovic-takovski_ustanak.jpg ) too . 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_gravia_inn ) is something even crazier, 
  they [ ganked ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_navarino ) but the great powers counterganked, 
  have in mind that russians and slavs in general were pretty engaged in europe at the time . 
  it was only after the communists took over that the slavs started distancing themselves . 
  the filiki eteria was also founded in odessa in ukraine for instance . 
  there were many greeks operating in ukraine , russia , romania , serbia etc. 
  greeks had pretty a pretty close relationship with people in the east and still do to this day . 
  yea it is not finland . 
  it was a pretty widespread flag during the revolution used by many greeks . 
  [ here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/epanastasi.jpg ) is another painting with that flag, 
  * the paintings : * - the sortie of missolonghi by theodoros vryzakis is about the [ third siege of missolonghi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/third_siege_of_missolonghi ) . 
  victor hugo 's poem `' les t\u00eates du s\u00e9rail '' from his `' les orientales '' ( 1829 ) celebrates the greek heroes of the siege - `` grateful hellas '' by theodoros vryzakis - [ eug\u00e8ne delacroix 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eug%c3%a8ne_delacroix ) [ massacre of chios ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_massacre_at_chios ) . 
  it is about the actual [ massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chios_massacre ) . 
  the event sparked waves of phillelenism across europe - the reception of [ lord byron ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lord_byron ) at missolonghi by theodoros vryzakis . 
  british poet lord byron played a pretty important role in the greek war of independence . 
  still to this day there are many roads , statues and centers named after him in greece . 
  he died in missolonghi greece .
