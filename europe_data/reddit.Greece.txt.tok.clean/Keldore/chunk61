  other parties like pis are pretty statist and christian democratic but are called `` conservative '' because of their stance of immigration only . 
  not to mention the greek `` independent greeks '' conspiracy theorists . 
  if it was n't for the british conservatives the ecr would have been a coalition of irrelevant fringe nationalist parties . 
  social democrats after the 90s are pretty ok with austerity and `` neoliberalism '' . 
  take a look at gerhard schr\u00f6der 's government and agenda 2010 for instance . 
  not to mention the blairites . 
  centrist christian democrat . 
  not conservative . 
  the epp is a centrist christian democrat party . 
  it is a member of the centrist democrat international . 
  they do n't have anything in common with what we call conservative today . 
  the kind of william f. buckley jr. conservatism . 
  and that is economic liberalism coupled with fiscal conservatism , realpolitik and strong defence instead of internationalist liberalism via the un , strong emphasis on individual rights and what we generally call libertarian ideals , small government , cultural cohesion and more decentralization . 
  the epp literally acts as a social democratic party . 
  i have read herman van rompuy 's book `` europa in de storm '' . 
  if i did n't knew who he was i would have though the book was written by a social democrat . 
  sorry but we conservatives are unrepresented at the eu level . 
  the epp is hardly a conservative party and the only party in the ecr that is sane is uk conservative party . 
  there is a void between social democrats and the nationalists in the eu . 
  that is pretty nice . 
  europe * needs * federalist conservative parties that will both promote the eu and state 's rights too . 
  just like the canadian conservative party and the american gop . 
  that is untill they get in power . 
  then they confiscate everyone 's guns except their own in order to stay in power . 
  at least that is what empirical evidence from past socialist revolutions tells us . 
  gun control should be a state issue and not something that that central eu should have a say on . 
  not only that but this madness affects norway and switzerland too . 
  the funny thing is that the epp in charge . 
  the so called `` conservatives '' . 
  more like socialists in sheep 's clothing .

  estimates vary from 800,000 to 1,800,000 according to various sources . 
  1.5 m is the most common number, 
  the [ armenian genocide ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian_genocide ) was the ottoman government 's ** systematic extermination of 1.5 million armenians ** , mostly ottoman citizens within the ottoman empire and its successor state , the republic of turkey . 
  the starting date is conventionally held to be 24 april 1915 , the day that ottoman authorities rounded up , arrested , and deported [ 235 to 270 armenian intellectuals and community leaders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deportation_of_armenian_intellectuals_on_24_april_1915 ) from constantinople to the region of ankara , the majority of whom were eventually murdered . 
  the genocide was carried out during and after world war i and implemented in two phases : the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour , followed by the deportation of women , children , the elderly , and the infirm on death marches leading to the syrian desert . 
  driven forward by military escorts , the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery , rape , and massacre . 
  other indigenous and christian ethnic groups such as the assyrians and the ottoman greeks were similarly targeted for extermination by the ottoman government in the [ assyrian genocide ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/assyrian_genocide ) and the [ greek genocide ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_genocide ) , and their treatment is considered by some historians to be part of the same genocidal policy . 
  ** turkey ** , the successor state of the ottoman empire , ** denies the word genocide as an accurate term for the mass killings of armenians ** that began under ottoman rule in 1915 . 
  to date , [ 29 countries have officially recognized the mass killings as genocide ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian_genocide_recognition#parliaments_and_governments ) , as have most genocide scholars and historians . 
  edit : * various related videos , interviews and more * turkish historian and sociologist [ * taner ak\u00e7am * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taner_ak%c3%a7am ) , who was arrested for saying that there are kurds in turkey and again arrested for protesting against the turkish invasion of cyprus , [ talks about ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qqxdp0jskm ) the armenian genocide . 
  he is one of the first turkish academics to acknowledge and openly discuss the armenian genocide . 
  [ * john oliver * on the armenian genocide ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hghbbashihu ) [ * christopher hitchens * on the armenian genocide ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzpgrc6rm-g ) anti-armenian/pro-turkish [ propaganda by * fact check armenia * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsurlsi4bru ) . 
  according to * fact check armenia * : `` despite the propaganda being pushed by a powerful and well-funded armenian diaspora , the series of events in 1915 and beyond resulted in losses of life on both sides of the conflict . 
  while we do not diminish the suffering that the armenians faced , we must also acknowledge that millions of turks , kurds , and arabs were also killed during this conflict . 
  as a result , international courts have never designated these tragic events as genocide . 
  there is no legal consensus on the tragedy of 1915 because history and the law tell us otherwise . 
  it 's time to cut through the propaganda and get the facts straight . '',

  i ca n't say if its common or not but from my experience it is a thing for sure . 
  both in france and quebec too . 
   that 's one source ok i 'll give you alexander and not herodotus :  holy shadows of the dead , i 'm not to blame for your cruel and bitter fate , but the accursed rivalry which brought sister nations and brother people , to fight one another . 
  i do not feel happy for this victory of mine . 
  on the contrary , i would be glad , brothers , if i had all of you standing here next to me , since we are united by the same language , the same blood and the same visions . 
  addressing the dead hellenes ( the athenean and thebean greeks ) of the battle of chaeronea , as quoted in historiae alexandri magni by quintus curtius rufus . 
   our enemies are medes and persians , men who for centuries have lived soft and luxurious lives ; we of macedon for generations past have been trained in the hard school of danger and war . 
  above all , we are free men , and they are slaves . 
  there are greek troops , to be sure , in persian service -- but how different is their cause from ours !, 
  they will be fighting for pay -- and not much of at that ; ** we , on the contrary , shall fight for greece ** , and our hearts will be in it . 
  as for our foreign troops -- thracians , paeonians , illyrians , agrianes -- they are the best and stoutest soldiers in europe , and they will find as their opponents the slackest and softest of the tribes of asia . 
  and what , finally , of the two men in supreme command ? 
  you have alexander , they -- darius !, 
  addressing his troops prior to the battle of issus , as quoted in anabasis alexandri by arrian book ii , 7 . 
   your ancestors came to macedonia and the rest of hellas [ greece ] and did us great harm , though we had done them no prior injury . 
  i have been appointed leader of the greeks , and wanting to punish the persians i have come to asia , which i took from you . 
  alexander 's letter to persian king darius iii of persia in response to a truce plea , as quoted in anabasis alexandri by arrian ; translated as anabasis of alexander by p. a. brunt , for the `` loeb edition '' book ii 14 , 4 . 
   youths of the pellaians and of the macedonians and of the hellenic amphictiony and of the lakedaimonians and of the corinthians ... and of all the hellenic peoples , join your fellow-soldiers and entrust yourselves to me , so that we can move against the barbarians and liberate ourselves from the persian bondage , ** for as greeks we should not be slaves to barbarians . 
  ** as quoted in the historia alexandri magni of pseudo-kallisthenes , 1.15.1-4 . 
  for some reason greeks love france . 
  a lot of times in our history we have tried to model our society and institutions after the french ones . 
  i was in france some years ago and i loved it . 
  the only problem was that my french was broke and you people * really * refuse to speak english . 
  i mean it was crazy . 
  people were asking me if i speak arab and spanish before asking me about english . 
  i would totally visit again . 
   no , people here do n't care much about the dispute . 
  never heard anyone mention it in real life . 
  you might either be too young or live to the far south . 
  i as someone who lives in macedonia hear about this dispute every chance there is . 
  just visit thessaloniki and tell an average educated person that there is a macedonian nation outside of greece that is slavic too . 
  you will be swimming in thermaic gulf in no time . 
   it 's the right of self determination . 
  the right of self determination should infringe upon other people . 
  who told you that they wo n't in the future make geographical claims upon greek macedonia ? 
  history is tricky and is often used for such acts . 
   there are hungarian transylvanians and romanian transylvanians , how about that ? 
  translylvanians is not a nation though . 
  it just describes geography . 
  the bulgarians that live in vardaska use the term to describe their so called nation . 
   to make it more simply for you , had the slavs invaded iberia there would probably be a sub-group of slavs who would call themselves ` slavic iberians ' . 
  refer to my above points  again , it 's self determination . 
  refer to my original point, 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b6wobiwsdc ), 
   their claims on macedonia are nationalistic nonsense . 
  glad we agree  but they have developed their own identity , which is the slav macedonian . 
  the fact that they use the term macedonians as you said earlier is nationalistic nonsense . 
  not to mention it hurts the brains of historians . 
   there 's no need to belong to a macedonian nation ti be a jew macedonian . 
  there were spanish jews , french jews etc. 
  you are confused by the term jew that has both a racial and a religious usage .
