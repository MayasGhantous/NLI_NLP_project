  first of all i did n't insult you or whined . 
  i pointed out some facts . 
  i have been studying history for many many years and i feel strongly the subject of history in general . 
   ask a german person . 
  the reason is frederick was glorified during the times the germans were building their national consensus . 
  he does n't really have anything to do with germany . 
  you ca n't mix different times and most importantly different institutions . 
   if i put alexander over macedonia you 'd still be whining and making insults at me because i hurt your national pride . 
  where did this come from ? 
  if i did n't have a greek flair would you still say that ? 
  i am half canadian . 
  if i had the canadian flag would you still bring up this infantile point ? 
  we are talking facts , not feelings . 
   i tried to use monarchs who were * closely related * to their countries . 
  any relations between phillip ii and a slavic country ? 
  according to your logic you should have kept the borders and then draw charlemagne over half of europe . 
   berthold v was a prince as i said some comments above . 
  switzerland had many nobles but not a monarch . 
  there is a big difference . 
   why is it a flaw ? 
  because you said so ? 
  yea ... because of the points i bring up . 
  i know it may took you some time and work to come up with it . 
  it is pretty polished . 
  you sure were/are happy about the result . 
  but learn to accept criticism . 
  i once worked on a paper for months and got rejected by my professor . 
  we are humans . 
  we make mistakes . 
   this is n't a history lecture hall , just a post on reddit . 
  in this age of easy access to information it is necessary to point out some things because young children may see something and accept is as a fact even though it may be wrong . 
  we should be careful about what we post online . 
  you clearly have borders drawn on the map and monarch inside these borders . 
   frederick the great is considered the greatest prussian ruler ftfy  skanderbeg was the de facto ruler of albania more of a general and a warrior . 
  not a monarch  philip ii ruled over what is present day fyrom and i put him there because the map shows the famous monarchs of europe and not the famous monarchs of present day european countries . 
  in the case of finland and sweden gustavus adolphus shares two countries . 
  why is n't for instance alexander over that country too ? 
  a territory wide monarch would do it . 
  now you imply nationhood . 
  if you wanted a monarch that ruled over greece alone you should have picked otto or george i of greece . 
   switzerland was part of the duchy of z\u00e4hringen for a long time . 
  berthold v is the monarch ... not a monarch . 
   certain countries that were n't or no longer monarchies were assigned famous rulers who ruled over that territory which is a flaw of course as i said . 
  mixing apples with oranges . 
  in any history lecture hall his would get disqualified for any further presentation . 
  well first of all these monarch do n't match the current states on which this map is drawn . 
  for instance frederick the great does n't really have anything to do with germany which is in a sense a bismarckian thing . 
  skanderbeg was n't really a monarch . 
  phillip ii has nothing to do with that country at the left of bulgaria that was founded in the 90s and never had a monarch . 
  switzerland never had a monarchy but had instead a general nobility . 
  many flaws . 
  this is wrong on so many levels, 
  absolutely . 
  hate speech laws are even more absurd . 
  hate speech is a loose term that ca n't really be defined and is interpreted differently by different people . 
   if you make 10,000 regulations you destroy all respect for the law laws that do n't serve actual purpose should be abolished . 
  we need few laws that matter . 
  not many irrelevant laws . 
  feel free to migrate to greece . 
  we can watch turkey burn from a kos or lesvos beach . 
   norway wanted to join the commonwealth til, 
  blasphemy laws are laws against liberty . 
  they should be abolished . 
  let 's just say that there is a strong feeling towards the city in general and not just among the nationalists . 
  not just the city but asia minor in general . 
  a lot of people were forced to leave the city because of hostility against them even though their roots were from there . 
  [ events like this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/istanbul_pogrom ) helped strengthen these feelings . 
  during the early 20th century one third of the city 's population was greek . 
  that changed fast as the process of turkification was taking place . 
  a rather bad experience for jews , greeks , armenians and non-turkish people in general . 
  a lot of people have hagia sophia paintings in their homes , pictures of their old homes in asia minor etc. 
  there is strong nostalgia . 
  of course people are trying to forget the bad experiences in the name of a healthier alliance in the region which will benefit both sides but peole like erdogan and his irredentist talk make it harder . 
  that is of no significance to my original points . 
  revolutions were a thing way before marxism and progressivism . 
  it is an extreme that always can be . 
  do n't forget the point of the 2nd amendment in the us which is that given a tyranical government takes place the people can have the means to revolt . 
  the thing is that such situations should be made almost impossible to arouse . 
  and this is were progressivism differs a lot from marxism . 
  it can work without revolt . 
  marxism strives for conflict, 
  that would be the most socialist choices . 
  in other words the worst choices . 
  progressivism come to be what we know it in a republican society . 
  the us and the institution of monarchy do n't mix together . 
  and progressivism as we understand it today is mainly an american ideology that later spread across the pond . 
  non american progressives were conservatives too like disraeli making them a different breed from the americans . 
  the beauty of the us system is that is build in a way that it can bring change without revolution . 
  their founders understood not only the dangers of a tyranical government but also the danger of social unrest and the extremes of democracy . 
  this is why progressives were able to transform a lot of the institutions without going down the `` smashing the pre-existent '' road during the [ progressive era ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/progressive_era ) . 
  please take a moment and read about this lesser known event of european history . 
  thank you in advance . 
  [ the greek genocide ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_genocide ) , part of which is known as the ** pontic genocide ** , was the systematic genocide of the christian ottoman greek population from its * historic homeland * in anatolia during world war i and its aftermath ( 1914 -- 22 ) . 
  ** it was instigated by the government of the ottoman empire and the turkish national movement against the indigenous greek population of the empire and it included massacres , forced deportations involving death marches , summary expulsions , arbitrary execution , and the destruction of christian orthodox cultural , historical , and religious monuments . 
  ** ** the allies ** of world war i ** condemned ** the ottoman government-sponsored massacres as crimes against humanity . 
  more recently , the international association of genocide scholars passed a resolution in 2007 recognising the ottoman campaign against christian minorities of the empire , including the greeks , as genocide . 
  some other organisations have also passed resolutions recognising the campaign as a genocide , as have the parliaments of * greece , cyprus , sweden , armenia , the netherlands , germany , austria and the czech republic * colin tatz argue that ** turkey denies the genocide ** so as not to jeopardize * `` its ninety-five-year-old dream of becoming the beacon of democracy in the near east '' * in their book negotiating the sacred : blasphemy and sacrilege in a multicultural society , elizabeth burns coleman and kevin white present a list of reasons explaining turkey 's inability to admit the genocides committed by the young turks , writing :  turkish denialism of the genocide of 1.5 million armenians is official , riven , driven , constant , rampant , and increasing each year since the events of 1915 to 1922 . 
  it is state-funded , with special departments and units in overseas missions whose sole purpose is to dilute , counter , minimise , trivialise and relativise every reference to the events which encompassed a genocide of armenians , pontian greeks and assyrian christians in asia minor . 
  in response to a 1998 law regarding the remembrance of the genocide in the greek parliament , the turkish government released a statement which claimed that describing the events as genocide was `` without any historical basis '' . 
  `` we condemn and protest this resolution '' a turkish foreign ministry statement said .
