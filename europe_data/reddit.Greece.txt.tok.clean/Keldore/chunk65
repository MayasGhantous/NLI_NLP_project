  `` with this resolution the greek parliament , which in fact has to apologize to the turkish people for the large-scale destruction and massacres greece perpetrated in anatolia , not only sustains the traditional greek policy of distorting history , but it also displays that the expansionist greek mentality is still alive , '' the statement added .

  ** academic discussion ** in december 2007 the [ international association of genocide scholars ( iags ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_association_of_genocide_scholars ) passed a resolution affirming that the 1914 -- 23 campaign against ottoman greeks constituted genocide . 
  utilising the term `` greek genocide '' , the resolution affirmed that alongside the assyrians , ottoman greeks were subject to a genocide `` qualitatively similar '' to the ottoman genocide of the armenians . 
  iags president gregory stanton urged * the turkish government to finally acknowledge the three genocides * :  * `` the history of these genocides is clear , and there is no more excuse for the current turkish government , which did not itself commit the crimes , to deny the facts . 
  '' * [ taner ak\u00e7am ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taner_ak%c3%a7am ) refers to contemporary accounts noting the difference in government treatment of ottoman greeks and armenians during ww i and concludes that `` despite the increasingly severe wartime policies , in particular for the period between late 1916 and the first months of 1917 , the government 's treatment of the greeks -- although comparable in some ways to the measures against the armenians -- differed in scope , intent , and motivation . 
  other genocide scholars , such as dominik j. schaller and j\u00fcrgen zimmerer , however stated that the `` genocidal quality of the murderous campaigns against greeks '' is `` obvious '' [ niall ferguson ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/niall_ferguson ) has drawn a comparison between sporadic massacres of pontic greek communities after 1922 and the fate of the armenians ** recognition ** as already told organisations have passed resolutions recognising the campaign as a genocide , as have the parliaments of * greece , cyprus , sweden , armenia , the netherlands , germany , austria and the czech republic * . 
  * the republic of cyprus * has also officially called the events `` greek genocide in pontus of asia minor '' . 
  on 11 march 2010 , * sweden 's riksdag * passed a motion recognising `` as an act of genocide the killing of armenians , assyrians/syriacs/chaldeans and pontic greeks in 1915 '' on 14 may 2013 , * the government of new south wales * was submitted a genocide recognition motion by fred nile of the christian democratic party , and was later passed making it the fourth political entity to recognise the genocide in march 2015 , the * national assembly of armenia * unanimously adopted a resolution recognizing both the greek and assyrian genocides .

  the [ amasya trials ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amasya_trials ) were special ad hoc trials , organized by the turkish national movement , with the purpose to kill en masse the greek representatives of pontus region under a legal pretext . 
  they occurred in amasya , modern turkey , during the * final stage of the pontic greek genocide * . 
  the trials and the executions in amasya by the ** turkish movement of mustafa kemal ** succeeded in the extermination of the pontic greek elite under a legal pretext while ** the total death toll of the pontic greek community ** , as a result of the ottoman and turkish policies , ** from 1915 to 1923 , is estimated from 353,000 to 360,000 . 
  ** in 1923 , a population exchange between greece and turkey resulted in a near-complete elimination of the greek ethnic presence in turkey and a similar elimination of the turkish ethnic presence in much of greece . 
  for the whole of the ** period between 1914 and 1922 ** and for the whole of anatolia , there are academic estimates of ** death toll ranging from 289,000 to 750,000 ** . 
  the figure of 750,000 is suggested by canadian political scientist adam jones .

  i am able to reach some bulgarian and skopjian tv channels from time to time . 
  their tv shows , or at least the ones i get , seem to be stuck in 90s, 
  even nl or the nordic countries in general are not democratic socialists . 
  the prime minister of denmark responded to bernie sanders calling them that and said that they fight pretty hard to be and stay free market countries . 
  nordic capitalism is capitalism in the end . 
  there is no welfare without a market producing wealth in the first place . 
   swedish socialist model sweden is nowhere near socialism . 
  high economic freedom , no minimum wage etc. 
  a welfare state does not mean socialism . 
  even libertarians like friedman and hayek advocated for welfare . 
  nothing beats a drunk finn and all that perrrrrrkele mumbling . 
  not everyone in europe is a social democrat . 
  conservatives ( you can think of european conservatives as corporate/conservative democrats ) are in power in the eu . 
  europe is not what michael moore wants you to think . 
  i am half canadian from ontario and all the conservatives i know including myself are pretty aligned with the gop ideologically . 
  liberals are the dominant center-left party and the ndp is being used as a scapegoat by both big parties . 
  compare that to the european parties and you will see how canadian politics are closer to us politics . 
  canada and the us are pretty similar . 
  if not identical . 
  getting everywhere by car , business culture , small talk , similar politics ( liberal-conservative ) , same language ( not counting quebec in this ) , same sports ( american football , hockey , basketball ) etc. 
  it also helps that they frequently travel between the two countries . 
  have in mind almost all canadians live near the border . 
  they are really friendly people too . 
  i would totally suggest visiting . 
  north america is a great place . 
   the primary system creates a situation where a candidate must appeal to the fringe and then pivot to the center for the general election . 
  that is sadly true . 
  this is why i believe that more moderate candidates in the gop need to work better . 
  take a look at the latest primaries for instance . 
  was there really a need for jeb * and * rubio to run ? 
  their policies were basically the same . 
  why split the votes and let fringe candidates take the lead ? 
  let 's hope that the next primaries wo n't have a million candidates and that the moderate forces will be more focused . 
   it also caused many southern conservatives to move over to the republicans , forcing that party further to the right and marginalizing its moderate/liberal wing . 
  but still the republicans nominated moderate candidates like hw bush . 
  a president that was really close with clinton democrats . 
  hell even reagan worked with democrats . 
  there is this center i am talking about . 
  but i believe that the partisan media have polluted this ideal . 
  they demonize way too much . 
  i remember during the 2012 election everyone calling romney extreme and evil . 
  yesterday joe biden urged romney to run for senate . 
  again bipartisanship . 
  everyone that studies history knows that the romneys were a moderate faction in the party . 
  even back in mitt 's father days . 
  it is just that propaganda has reached new lows and campaign rhetoric forces the worst of each candidate in order to please the base . 
  i believe we get this impression because the media game has changed . 
  remember how during the 2000s the media portaited bush as anti climage change ? 
  anti muslim ? 
  that rhetoric lead to the extremists actually taking over . 
  in reality bush was different . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8g2sb4ty4y ) and [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygtbwgrtelc ) . 
  i believe there is bipartisanship . 
  yesterday i believe joe biden urged mitt romney to run for senate . 
  campaign rhetoric and partisan media has created an enviroment were it is hard for many to see that things are calmer than usual . 
  yes populists are having their 15 minutes atm ( sanders , trump etc. ), 
  but imo that wo n't last . 
   that you were purposely using your personal definitions , while aware that they are n't shared by others was n't clear to me . 
  i am half canadian and that is a lot of times i use american terms and usage of english . 
  sorry for the confusion . 
  canadians use american terms . 
  what i love about the senate , house and president system is [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggz_gd--uo0 ) i think it forces better laws . 
  it breeds a center between the two parties . 
  yea sure there are extremists forces in both parties but the majority of both often reach bipartisan greatness . 
  one of the great examples of this is the civil rights act . 
  everett mckinley dirksen , a republican , forged and helped pass this act under a democratic president that promoted it . 
  first of all only you and another guy have replied to my comment . 
  not `` is full of people '' . 
  secondly this sub is generally anti-us . 
  i expect downvotes and disagreements . 
  the setting matters . 
  israel does n't need direct neighbors in order to maintain a balance of power . 
  in a modern warfare context there are things that matter more . 
  i pretty sure if you had turkish jets flying over your area a millions times per day you would too be a bit more cautious about security . 
  been doing that for over 20 years . 
  not going to need history lessons on reddit from an angry stranger . 
  heh you go with what you have . 
  international relations are made on power and for security reasons . 
  not ideology or friendship . 
   just google it ffs .
