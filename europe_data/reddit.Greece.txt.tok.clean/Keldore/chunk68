  it is all about power and influence . 
  it is the reason the us is allied with the saudis . 
  it is the reason the soviets worked with the third reich . 
  it is the reason we are looking for deals with china . 
  realpolitik . 
  well people who say it was hypocritical do n't really understand how politics , especially election time politics , work . 
  president trump 's speech was what it needed to be . 
  called for support against terrorism , called for moderation in islam and in general ( [ let 's not forget this too ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/trump-opens-global-center-for-combating-extremist-ideology-with-egypts-al-sissi-saudi-arabias-salman/2017/05/21/2875d228-3e4f-11e7-b29f-f40ffced2ddb_video.html ) . 
  ) , looked for bigger coalitions etc. 
  he was honest enough to say `` islamic terrorism '' in ksa . 
  what would his critics want the speech to be , seriously ? 
  i find it really interesting that whenever i meet someone from norway they are 8 out of 10 times fairly libertarian and against the concept of welfare dependance . 
  this coming from norway is quite interesting considering norway has strong welfare . 
  is it the influence of the frp or is there something that am i missing about norway ? 
  bulgaria attracts a lot of greek students already . 
  the reason is that our socialist governments have banned private universities so people travel to plovdiv or sofia in order to enroll there . 
  exactly . 
  i view it pretty similarly . 
  sadly people overeact to these ideas . 
  of course there are . 
   nationalism is gone in europe not really true . 
  it is not gone and it wo n't go away anytime soon . 
  i would argue that some amount of nationalism is needed even if we want a federal europe . 
  paneuropean nationalism . 
  nationalism can be good and bad . 
  it is like drinking alcohol or lighting a fire . 
  them being good or bad depends on how you use them . 
  here are some dictator 's that i believe were beneficial for their countries . 
  just to clarify something . 
  this is from a historical point of view . 
  i am not advocating for dictarship in any shape or form . 
  ** ioannis metaxas ( greece ) ** prepared greece for wwii and lead the greeks against fascist italy eventually leading to greek victory over the italian forces . 
  brilliant military mind and an excellent general . 
  ** pinochet ( chile ) ** obvious . 
  looking at south america today you can only tell that chile is the only country that people did n't experience starvation and degeneracy caused by socialist regimes . 
  ** park chung-hee ( south korea ) ** considered to be korea 's greatest stateman he transformed korea to an economic powerhouse . 
  he made steps towards normalization of the shaky korean-japanese relationship . 
  now some people that make the list but are not really dictators but were near-dictators : lee kuan yew , deng xiaoping and mannerheim . 
  not my pick but due to the respect he has in his region i think tito makes the list too . 
  again these people did some really terrible things . 
  it is sad that they did things that democracies failed to do and it is sad that democracies failed to prevent these people or deliver solutions during hard times . 
  they were beneficial at the time . 
  good thing they are gone now . 
  we learn from mistakes . 
  nice try michael moore . 
   only in a unlimited market  this could mean someone else ca n't not everyone has the same buying capabilities . 
  the point is to have equality of opportunity and fairness , not equality of outcome . 
   you ca n't act responsibly if you ca n't calculate the consequences of your actions if you ca n't calculate the consequences of your actions that is your problem . 
  no one is here to parent you . 
  we are here to help you and give you some guidelines when in need but we are not here to take you by the hand for the rest of your life . 
  what you do with your life is up to you . 
  you should be free to do whatever you want with your life . 
   he fact that enhances personal freedom implies that such freedom is gained at the expenses of other men . 
  this is not a zero sum game . 
  me having a car does n't mean that you ca n't have one too . 
  me owning a house does n't mean that you ca n't own one too . 
   you esentially said : `` well you just have to do it right ! '', 
  exactly . 
  liberty implies responsibility . 
  how you use your rights is up to you and only you . 
   but if i interpret it right you are saying that resources control is not an important factor in international politics i never mentioned anything about resources . 
  power politics is power politics . 
  it is a way of doing international relations and it has to do with power over ideas . 
  it is the reason that liberal us is allied with the autocratic saudis . 
  it is the reason the soviets allied themselves firstly with the reich and then with the allies . 
  it is about national interests not ideas . 
  i brought up alcohol just as an example . 
  same goes for more than drugs . 
  speeding with your car , how much you obsessed with something , how much do food you eat etc. 
   how is private property helping the human race ? 
  private property enhances personal liberty but creating personal domains and giving you authority over your possessions  dose n't it causes endless struggle to obtain more ? 
  that is up to each and everyone of us . 
  it has to do with how we use property . 
  same goes with everything . 
  alcohol can be good or bad depending on how you use it . 
   why are nations sensible concepts if they do nothing but attack each other to increase their private property ? 
  international struggles have more to do with power politics rather than vague ideas . 
  we have plenty of empirical evidence on that . 
  so many people saying `` communism was a good idea that was executed the wrong way '' how is the abolition of property a good idea ? 
  how is the idea of class conflict and constant revolution of the working class against the ruling class a good idea ? 
  so many destructive ideas hiding behind beautiful words ... people fall for that too easily edit : typo, 
  same here . 
  i meet a lot of swiss , german and austrian hikers when hiking here in greece during summertime . 
  i enjoy these small talks on the trail . 
  germans are a bit akward though . 
  it is like they are trying to say hello but they are afraid to do so . 
   actually you ca n't go on much farther than that , because there are n't that many gun mass killings in europe . 
  here you go : [ 2016 nenzing shooting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_nenzing_shooting ) , 3 killed 11 injured [ hungerford massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungerford_massacre ) , 17 killed 15 injured [ 2010 bratislava shooting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_bratislava_shooting ) , 8 killed 17 injured [ \u017diti\u0161te shooting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%bditi%c5%a1te_shooting ) , 5 killed 22 injured you get the point . 
  this is my point . 
  guns are not the problem . 
  people and institutions are . 
  per 100,000 population in one year and includes suicides , accidents and justifiable homicides . 
  all gun related and not by other means . 
   i believe that you might find this interesting . 
  ** firearm related death rate ** i literally wrote next to it what this is . 
  i believe that you might find [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/list_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate.jpg ) interesting . 
  firearm related death rate, 
  i would want a wife in danger because of a lunatic husband to be able to shoot him using an easier to use weapon . 
  this is why with legal guns it is easier to track criminals and also honeypot them with cheaper prices . 
  at least the idiots .
