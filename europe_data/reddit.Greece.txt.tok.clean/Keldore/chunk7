  - `` the burning of the ottoman frigate at eressos by dimitrios papanikolis '' by konstantinos volanakis . 
  * general info about the revolution : * - in 1814 , a secret organization called the [ filiki eteria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/filiki_eteria ) was founded with the aim of liberating greece . 
  the filiki eteria planned to launch revolts in the peloponnese , the danubian principalities , and in constantinople and its surrounding areas . 
  the organization was heavily influenced by the italian [ carbonari ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carbonari ) and freemasonry . 
  - this greek movement for independence was not only the first movement of national character in eastern europe , but also the first one in a non-christian environment , like the ottoman empire - because of the greek origin of so much of the west 's classical heritage , there was tremendous sympathy for the greek cause throughout europe . 
  some wealthy americans and western european aristocrats , such as the renowned poet lord byron and later the physician [ samuel howe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/samuel_gridley_howe ) , took up arms to join the greek revolutionaries - the classicist [ edward everett ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edward_everett ) , professor of greek at harvard , was active in championing the greek cause in the united states and in november 1821 published an appeal from adhamantios korais reading `` to the citizens of the united states , it is your land that liberty has fixed her abode , so you will not assuredly imitate the culpable indifference or rather the long ingratitude of the europeans '' , going on to call for american intervention , in several american newspapers . 
  - [ george canning ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/george_canning ) was the architect of the treaty of london , which launched european intervention against the ottomans in the greek conflict . 
  - after the war [ ioannis capodistrias ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ioannis_kapodistrias ) was elected governor of greece . 
  he had served as foreign minister of the russian empire and was one of the most distinguished politicians and diplomats of europe . 
  while a conservative at home he championed liberalism in europe making him an enemy of [ klemens von metternich ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/klemens_von_metternich ) . 
  his first important mission , in november 1813 , was as unofficial russian ambassador to switzerland , with the task of helping disentangle the country from the french dominance imposed by napoleon . 
  he secured swiss unity , independence and neutrality , which were formally guaranteed by the great powers , and actively facilitated the initiation of a new federal constitution for the 19 cantons that were the component states of switzerland , with personal drafts . 
   trump , april 27 ** 2016 ** : yeap as i said earlier . 
  rhetoric is one thing . 
  policy is another . 
  especially pre elections rhetoric . 
  [ there is a plan ] ( http://news.err.ee/200723/baltic-presidents-meet-with-us-vice-president-pence ) . 
  the us is committed to nato . 
  well we ca n't talk hypothetically . 
  we better base our views on actions and not assumptions . 
   not doing anything while another country is invaded . 
  you talking about obama watching ukraine burn ? 
  because i am pretty sure the republicans were not in charge then . 
  republicans called for us military assistance . 
  rhetoric is one thing . 
  policy is another . 
   but maybe they 'll ask for more in return estonia already spends the agreed nato amount if i am not mistaken . 
  it has to considering the neighboring country . 
  the us will probably ask for more from germany . 
  you probably missed it but trump is president . 
  and he appointed j. mattis for secretary of defence . 
  the guy who supports permanent us troop presence in the baltics . 
   the us republicans , in general , do n't seem that keen on defending the baltics . 
  what ? 
  where did you pulled that out from ? 
  why not both ? 
  the far left in greece is considered normal for some weird reason so many people identify as that . 
  even if the opposition wins nothing changes in turkey . 
  the chp panders to nationalists everytime . 
  this is why i said that the people have to change . 
  and yes i agree that `` democracy 's biggest weakness are the people '' . 
  this is what happens when your system allows centralization of power . 
  this is why the first thing a free state must do is to make sure there is seperation of powers , really independent courts etc. 
  sadly it does n't work like that . 
  a big ( very big ) portion of the turkish people love him . 
  even if he goes the legacy will stay and other will try to live up to that legacy . 
  remember . 
  laws and states do n't change people . 
  if turks want change they have to change the general consensus of the people first . 
  think tanks , publications etc. 
  i would bet the sc would rule against them . 
  geopolitical dominance is really important for a country to let go so easily . 
  the us fought tooth and nail to expand across the continent and assure a strategic position against mexico and the brirish ( now canadians ) . 
  it 's all power politics . 
  they ca n't secede because of the 14th amendment . 
  by withdrawing from the union the state denies citizens the us rights that they get because they were born us subjects . 
  it is unconstitutional . 
  well this is one of my `` controversial '' views . 
  apparently anything pro-american is not viewed as good here . 
  many european are really arrogant thinking really low of the us . 
  i am a minority here being pro-usa . 
  i * really * admire the us . 
  and the federal government would laugh . 
  there is ** no ** way the federal government would ever allow secession to happen . 
  even if a referendum result was pro secession, 
  the us wo n't hold a referendum on nafta or nato or the un . 
  local refs on weed for instance is not as significant and important as national issues are . 
  in greece we had a stupid referendum on national policy almost two years ago . 
  that just does n't happen in the us . 
  debatable . 
   the fact that the constitution is hard to change also does not help the fact that things such as gerrymandering or the electoral college are still an issue . 
  the electoral college [ is needed ] ( http://imgur.com/a/unmtf ) in my opinion otherwise the country is ruled by ny and la. 
   you also mention in another comment that you prefer `` grand coalitions instead of the tyranny of the majority '' , which is fundamentally impossible to achieve in the 2 party system of the united states , due to the difficulty of constitutional change . 
  also the two party system is a grand coalition in itself . 
  the gop for instance is a party of conservatives , nationalists , libertarians , progressive conservatives , moderates etc. 
  the democrats are a party of progressives , liberals , moderate conservatives etc. 
  the people create the coalition within a party and then breed the center between the two parties . 
  i am a minority in this by i find that system far supierior to our multi party parliamentary system . 
  damn romans adopted parts of greek cultures and myths but did n't absorb our language . 
  this whole map could have been yellow . 
  the only european left using more greek words than it is appropriate is boris johnson ... 
  what does federalism has to do with this ? 
  state 's right you mean i suppose . 
  yes that is important . 
  but we are talking about national issues such as brexit . 
  the us does n't hold such kinds of referendums . 
   there are referendums in the us on state level . 
  not on national issues . 
  local referendums are irrelevant . 
   also switzerland holds referendums all the time and is one of the most successful countries on the planet . 
  switzerland is not successfull because of the referendums . 
  not to mention that switzerland in general is not your everyday country . 
   if anything the eu needs more democracy . 
  democracy is safer under the rule of law , stability and grand coalitions instead of the tyranny of the majority . 
  there is an in between area that works just fine . 
  [ professor dawkins put it nicely ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaysoifpusg ), 
   farage had already said he would call for a new one when he thought he had lost so yes people had called for another one . 
  that would be stupid too . 
  what 's your point ? 
  does n't matter if it is the remain or leave side .
