- and of course ( they gave us ) the word ' * genoymeen * ' ( ' * \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03bc\u03b7\u03bd * ' ) - what ? 
  - the word ' * genoymeen * ' , though i think we gave that one back straight away !, 
  a first i was like : '' * why kant specifically ? 
  * '' and then ... '' * a-priori vs a-posteriori * '' , right !, 
  kant 's thinking affected my own more than i remembered i guess . 
  in any case , i used to be a huge fan , still am , and so it 's a great compliment , thanks !, 
   * how are comments like this one permitted here ? 
  what is this , the third reich ... * the censorship of his comment seems scarier to me , more * third-reich-like * if you will , than the comment itself . 
  corruption ** could ** conceivably also be a matter of genetics ( like most things ) ... or not . 
  unless you hold that '' *** it is not !, 
  *** '' is an unquestionable a-priori , dogma . 
  look , some mental conditions are correlated with certain genetic markers , are they not ? 
  and these conditions are manifested by a patient 's tendencies and behaviours , are they not ? 
  so it 's ** not inconceivable ** that certain habitual behaviours might indeed be correlated with certain genetic markers . 
  in other words , what manifests itself as a sociopathic disregard for the welfare of the society in which one lives , with a subject functioning parasitically on that society ( positioning himself to divert societal efforts aimed at general benefits to ** only ** benefit oneself ) might be a symptom of some pathology ... one with a genetic aspect to it . 
  but this is a matter of research , of determination , of facts , of * truth/reality * not dogma . 
  and if there is , in * truth/reality * , a strong genetic correlation to such a pathology , then what ? 
  discussion of it must be what ... 
  cheers !, 
  ^ edit : typo, 
  well , it 's spot on . 
  there 's also a strong emphasis on '' *** \u039c\u0391\u03a3 *** '' '' ( meaning '' * our * '' ) :  '' *** our *** * money ... * '' , '' *** our *** * businesses ... * '' , '' *** our *** * children ... * '' , '' *** our *** * voice ... * '' etc. , and so '' *** our *** * patience is exhausted * '' . 
  finally , '' * our kids have * *** immigrated *** '' means that they came from somewhere else to live in greece . 
  '' *** emigrate *** '' is what you do when you leave the country to move to another . 
  that 's it , carry on . 
  cheers !, 
   '' * the church of hagia sophia ( literally `` holy wisdom '' ) in constantinople , now istanbul , was first dedicated in 360 by emperor constantius , son of the city 's founder , emperor constantine . 
  hagia sophia served as the cathedra , or bishop 's seat , of the city . 
  originally called megale ekklesia ( great church ) , the name hagia sophia came into use around 430 . 
  the first church structure was destroyed during riots in 404 ; the second church , built and dedicated in 415 by emperor theodosius ii , burned down during the nika revolt of 532 , which caused vast destruction and death throughout the city . 
  immediately after the riots , emperor justinian i ( r. 527 -- 65 ) ordered the church rebuilt . 
  * [ the metropolitan museum of art ] ( http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/haso/hd_haso.htm ), 
  it 's ... * suspended * prison sentence . 
  even that is completely unacceptable . 
  but as bad as this is , nobody is going to prison . 
   * first , it 's a bit unsubstantiated ( unless you add more recent events than ottoman subjugation as part of the cause for the `` mind of the slave '' effect ) * . 
  that 's a strong point . 
  if there is indeed the `` slave-effect '' at play , it should have worn off after a generation , should n't it ? 
  but it seems to somehow perpetuate itself . 
   * for the better part of the last century freedom has ( unfortunately ) become synonymous with pursuing one 's self interest even at the detriment of the community . 
  * oh , i disagree but it would wake way to long to get into it beyond perhaps saying that self-interest and community-interest mus not necessarily conflict . 
  they usually actually enhance each other . 
  of course they can and do sometimes conflict . 
  what then ? 
  well , legal safeguards must be placed to protect individuals from mob-mentalities . 
   * all the talk about pinnacles of civilisation , past or modern , is necessarily romanticised . 
  while i love a lot of things sweden is doing now and i love a lot of things that were invented in ancient greece , would call neither `` a pinnacle of civilisation '' . 
  * that 's fine but whenever i search for societies that excel , as compared to others of their times ( the only meaningful comparison ) , ancient greece back then and sweden today seem to consistently pop-up . 
  so what else to do ? 
  if you can think of comparatively better societies than those two , that 'd be even better !, 
   * you question assumes that there 's a direct lineage between ancient greece and modern greece . 
  the area has been conquered and re-conquered , configured and re-configured a ton of times since then . 
  comparing the two is comparing apples to oranges . 
  it 's not so much decadence as just two different societies with only a few salient characteristics connecting them . 
  * undoubtedly !, 
  but the question is nonetheless still interesting , is n't it ? 
  cheers !, 
  do try to figure out whether something is ** accurate or not ** instead of trying to make it it fits some simple '' * racist/nationalist rhetoric * '' label . 
  i figure that maybe you 're faced with ideas outside your comfort zone and i may arguably write very badly , but do make an effort at least . 
  i 'll do my best to elucidate if you ask for clarification . 
  but so far you seem to deal with not understanding my comments by attempting to switch the subject matter to whether or not my comments fit your ready-made '' * inferior vs superior * '' prejudice . 
  this is so fucking idiotic !, 
  look , greeks are neither superior nor inferior and frankly , who gives a fuck ? 
  so , seriously , get off it !, 
  nonsense !, 
  i do n't think of '' * greeks as generally inferior * '' . 
  but i do n't think of greeks as * superior * either . 
  these terms are almost completely meaningless in this context . 
  however , i do find convincing the idea that ( as far a circumstances affect disposition ) , the sense of responsibility that characterises ethical thought requires one to be free . 
  slaves can seldom afford to be concerned about matters beyond their own selves , their assigned tasks and perhaps their family . 
  free self-determined men , on the other hand , do need to consider matters in terms of the welfare of their whole society . 
  because if they do n't worry about it themselves , nobody else will . 
  in any case , swedish behaviour reflects ethical responsibility , much more than greek behaviour does . 
  but that 's the thing : the hellenes basically invented ethical responsibility ( along with philosophy , politics and most sciences ) . 
  and northern tribes ( like the swedes ) used to be considered * completely barbaric . 
  today , sweden is a pinnacle of civilisation and greece like a hundred years behind them . 
  why ? 
  an intelligent , ethical and efficient society should normally produce no garbage whatsoever . 
  it 's not even that hard in theory . 
  in practise of course , that 's another matter . 
  no society that i know of , save perhaps some northern-european ones ( [ ** got ta love sweden !, 
  ** ] ( http://www.trueactivist.com/sweden-runs-out-of-garbage/ ) ) , have even come close to actualising this idea . 
  as for today 's greece , forget it . 
  concepts like * recycling * are beyond most greeks ' ability to even understand , let alone apply in practise . 
  oh they might talk about it , especially politicians , and pretend to understand why it 's important etc. 
  but they do n't actually '' * get it * '' , not really . 
  it 's like what a friend of mine ( who had been with msf in zimbabwe ) said about how it is to talk in cntral africa about why '' * democracy * '' is important . 
  '' * they know some basic platitudes to say to humour us , but they do n't actually seem to understand anything about it * '' she said . 
  well , it 's the same with greeks and recycling . 
  and because the whole thing flies over their head , they think that those who are in favour of it are being '' * naive * '' to use the more polite term . 
  there you have it . 
  but how could greeks have gotten so far back and so * low-minded * so to speak , especially after such a illustrious history ? 
  well , this has been the subject of many debates . 
  one theory is that like all peoples who have been slaves too long ( first of rome and then of the ottomans ) , greeks lost that sense of * responsibility * that characterises free men . 
  the mind of a slave only need think about how to survive , do as little as possible , to get/steal as much as possible and how to get away with stuff . 
  he feels no responsibility nor gives a fuck about the society around him . 
  after a enough generations of this , one only understand bribes and threats and becomes incapable of * ethical * thought . 
  * intellectually * , though the language is different , you 'll have better luck finding the descendants of the hellenes among people named something like '' * bengt samuelsson * '' than '' * evangelos venizelos * '' ( actual name '' * evangelos turkoglu * '' ) . 
  incidentally , had you , in ancient times , told a hellene ( or later a roman ) that northern ( swedish ) barbarians would one day represent the pinnacle of civilisation , they would have laughed . 
  cheers !,
