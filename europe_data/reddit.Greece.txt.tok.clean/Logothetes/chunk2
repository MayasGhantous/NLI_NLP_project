  the situation in cyprus should normally be simplicity itself : half of the country is under an illegal military occupation by turkey . 
  that it 's illegal is in no way controversial . 
  every single country in the world ( except of course turkey ) calls this occupation illegal . 
  but it is nonetheless ongoing . 
  that this is still going on today is probably due to the crassest of reasons . 
  turkey is a large , populous and strategically located country . 
  and in exchange for being '' * friendly * '' , buying lots of western products ( especially expensive weaponry ) , not to mention siding with '' * western * '' interests ( even when they kill muslims by the tens of thousands ) , strongman turkish regimes have been promoted as '' * good muslims * '' ( the population less so ) . 
  but this unholy arrangement requires a bit of a quid pro quo with the us and nato also pretending not to notice '' * gross human rights violations * '' and that a turkish military regime is currently occupying half of cyprus . 
  even the european union itself plays ball with this . 
  and consider that turkey is actually occupying half a european union member state !, 
  it 's hard to believe that europe has not responded in strength . 
  one would think that an illegal occupation would provide a fairly robust cassus beli , would n't it ? 
  but apparently not . 
  so far , '' * oh it 's complicated !, 
  * and other evasive bullshit always seems to win the day . 
  this is why europe can not be taken seriously . 
  think of the insult to everyone 's intelligence bullshit the usa used to attack poor , weak far away countries that did n't do anything to them . 
  their arguments were ( and still are ) so transparently absurd they seemed taken from us professional wrestling . 
  yet europe went along and even helped them murder those poor mediaeval goat-herders . 
  but all the while , european land was and is under occupation by a nato '' * ally * '' and nobody said anything . 
  so , things are actually not that complicated , not really . 
  turkey needs to be told , in no uncertain terms , to get the fuck out of cyprus , period , no ifs or buts . 
  only after it has kicked turkey off cyprus , might europe be taken seriously , not a day before . 
  until that day , europe will necessarily been seen as a joke by turks ... and everybody else . 
  rather ** un ** complicated , is n't it ? 
  bye bye now , hear !, 
  [ nous ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nous ) used to characterise the greeks . 
  by '' * turkish * '' mentality , i mean to respect * might * more than * right * , * practicality * more than * principles * and power ( including '' * divine * '' power ) more than * reason * . 
  turkey did try ( unsuccessfully ) to become secular/rational . 
  but most turks are nonetheless much worse off in this area than most greeks . 
  edit : too many words . 
   * in ancient greece to be greek was to follow the olympic gods but christianity quickly took the place of it * how greek * followed the olympic gods * is not so simple . 
  they were amazingly subtle thinkers . 
  gods were understood on many levels , and mostly as personified concepts . 
  each god would mirror idealised human characteristics and even pure ideals . 
  ( think of victory , justice or liberty being personified by statuesque ladies , '' * lady liberty * '' for example . 
  by putting a wreath at the foot of the statue that personifies it , you seek honour ** the idea of liberty ** ) . 
  also , it depends what you mean by '' * christianity quickly took the place of it * '' . 
  in 415 ad a christian mob murdered ( in the most horrific way ) a woman called [ hypatia of alexandria ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hypatia ) . 
  this woman was a professor , mathematician , and neoplatonist philosopher , and the head of the platonist school at alexandria . 
  her death marked the end of hellenism . 
  if homer lived around 850 , bc by which time hellenic mythology seems to have been rather well established , '' * quickly * '' means at least a millennium or two , especially if , as you have , you take 1,000 ad as the end date of the hellenic religion . 
   * but overall in greece , religion was a mix of both up until around 1,000 ad when the last pagan greeks in the area of south peloponnesus ceased to follow it * it was indeed mix . 
  it is astounding how neoplatonic many christian ideas are or how many sophisticated ethical concepts ( reminiscent of buddhism ) are to be found in the new testament . 
  when compared to the self-serving tribal pseudo-ethics of the old testament , not to mention its primitive genocidal barbarism , it 's like two entirely different worlds . 
  yet they are to be understood as part of the same mythology . 
   * greece is the only country outside of middle east to have a state religion and it is because the role the church played and during this time religion and ethnicity molded together . 
  * the role of the christian church in safeguarding the language , many ideas and a identity during the ottoman occupation is undeniable . 
  without it , greek may have disappeared altogether . 
  it is right for this to be recognised . 
  nonetheless , '' * greek * '' and '' * orthodox christian * '' are still not the same . 
  it 's more complex than that . 
  keep in mind that , neo-platonic or not , christianity was still a heresy of judaism imposed by roman emperors upon conquered greeks . 
  i 'm quite fond of christian orthodoxy because there is much wisdom , kindness and love there and because it 's familiar and part of our tradition . 
  but i still find it ironic that it should be seen as '' * defining * '' what it means to be * `` greek * '' . 
   * in the modern age being catholic or athiest wo n't make you a `` non-greek '' but being muslim will like you said * agreed . 
  but this not * necessarily * the case . 
  it is mostly due to the peculiar history of balkan muslims and is also our fault to some extent . 
  and again a lot depends on how you understand '' * greek * '' . 
  years ago i met wasp university professor teaching in boston , mass ( fluent in both aristotelian and homeric greek ) who was clearly more greek in knowledge , mentality and love of classical greek ideals than most '' * greeks * '' living in greece , who though they might proudly call themselves greeks , seem more turkish than anything else in mentality . 
  remember that the easy nationalistic categories we like to create for our sense of identity may not always reflect reality . 
  i do not agree . 
  with jews , religion is indeed tied with ethnic identity . 
  some canaanite/syro-palestinians became '' * jews * '' by following a particular religion . 
  in other words , their identity and their religion necessarily went hand in hand . 
  but depending on your understanding of the term '' * greeks * '' ( '' * \u1f1d\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 * '' ? 
  ) , greek '' * tribes * '' / city-states were '' * greek * '' well before christianity ( some even say that with christianity they stopped being greeks ( '' * \u1f1d\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 * '' ) in anything but language . 
  so , either homer , pythagoras , leonidas , pericles plato and aristotle for example were n't '' * greek * '' or to be greek is *** not *** necessarily to be greek orthodox . 
  are the modern day followers of [ olypianism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hellenism_%28religion%29 ) not '' * greek * '' for example ? 
  they would seem to be even more greek than the followers of '' * christianity * '' ( a personality-cult heresy of a primitive syropalestinian worship , which some roman emperors took and imposed on everybody , making it thus the dominant religion ) . 
  the only thing that could possibly be argued ( at the limit , and * political-correctness * notwithstanding ) is that * to be greek is not to be muslim * . 
  some muslims in greece can sometimes have a peculiar attitude that could easily be described as '' * anti-greek * '' , especially if they think they are talking to another fellow muslim . 
  it seems that they may even pine for islamic/turkish occupation again . 
  so i guess that , though this is not always the case or necessarily so , compared to '' * greek orthodox christians * '' one could conceivably generally and prejudicially qualify them as * not-quite-as - `` greek '' * so to speak . 
  but even in that case , islam would be the only religion in the way of being '' * greek * '' . 
  and this is due to the very peculiar history of the muslims in the balkans . 
  all muslims in the balkans had previously been christians . 
  but they converted to islam during ottoman occupation ( often for lower taxes and generally better treatment ) . 
  and since liberation from the turkish yoke they have n't known quite where they belonged . 
  and they were looked down by by the christian population ( for having denied christianity and switched religion in order to please their ottoman occupier ) , any feeling of alienation made worse by being made to feel ashamed for being muslim . 
  this can easily explain any '' * anti-greek * '' feelings of resentment . 
  in conclusion , to be greek is not necessarily to be an orthodox christian . 
  among my acquaintances and friends for example most are atheists , a friend of my father ( who had fought for greece against both the italians and the germans ) was a '' * greek catholic * '' and i can count more than a couple '' * greek-buddhists * '' , at least one '' * greeks jew * '' and a surprising many '' * new-age-greeks * '' . 
  and beyond that , the use of term '' * greek * '' is a very complex matter : [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/names_of_the_greeks ) :  '' * when the romans first encountered greek colonists in southern italy , they used the name graeci for the colonists and then for all greeks ; this became the root of all relevant terms in european languages . 
  ( ... ) by late antiquity ( c. 3rd -- 7th century ce ) the greeks referred to themselves as rhomaioi ( `` romans '' ( greek : \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9 ) or romioi ( greek : \u03a1\u03c9\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03af ) ) since virtually all greeks were roman citizens after 212 ce . 
  the term `` hellene '' became applied to the followers of the polytheistic ( `` pagan '' ) religion after the establishment of christianity by theodosius i. 
  no , they did n't get * their cathedrals all mixed up * you moron . 
  the context is fine . 
  '' * the magna ecclesia * '' was not the name of the church . 
  they called it that because , compared to other contemporary churches , it was a big-ass church , which is what '' * magna ecclesia * '' means . 
  '' * the big church * '' was not its actual name of course . 
  it was called '' * the hagia sofia * '' ( heavenly wisdom ) . 
  and `` justinian 's was just * hagia sofia * 's second complete rebuilt , which was required due to a fire , just as the one ordered by theodosius ii had been . 
  as i had written , the original hagia sofia was ordered by constantine . 
  and that its construction was not finished until the end of the reign of his son constantius ii is why i had specifically written '' * ordered by * '' and not '' * built by * '' ( few if any of constantine 's commissioned churches seem to have actually been completed during his lifetime ) . 
  so , i do n't quite know what point you were trying to make . 
  and what 's with your * `` built by justinian , end of story , not up for debate * '' !?!, 
  you just wanted to show that you knew that the one ( more or less ) standing today was the one built by justinian or what ? 
  edit : removed `` colourful language '' to make it more civil . 
   * by your own argument , the turks defaced constantinople , a shining example of greek culture and arhitecture and the centre of orthodox christianity .
