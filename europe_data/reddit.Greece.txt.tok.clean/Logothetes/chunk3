  should it be returned to the greeks ? 
  * by my own argument ? 
  nonsense . 
  i wrote about the church . 
  you 're going on about the city . 
  you seem to make up your own stuff to argue against . 
   * ... without the ottomans it would have probably crumbled to the ground . 
  * ... more made up nonsense . 
   * would you have prefered it if they had destroyed it ? 
  * are you completely stupid ? 
   * ... its history is intact * they gutted it . 
  they only left the walls . 
  and then they tried to pass it off as a mosque . 
   * actually , my point was that the hagia sophia would serve much better as a museum than as a church . 
  * why ? 
  of course it would n't !, 
  it would serve much better as what it is than as what it is not . 
  would the musaeum of alexandria ( aka library of alexandria ) serve much better as a mosque or a church than as a museum/library ? 
  sancta sophia was designed by illustrious physicist and mathematician specifically to be a church . 
  it was then built to be a church . 
  and it was finally inaugurated as a fucking church to then be used as a church . 
  i guess that this must then make it ... * a mosque ... or a museum * !, 
  wtf !, 
  '' * from the chronicles of socrates of constantinople , we know that the church was * *** [ built by the orders of constantine the great ] ( http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingid=4 ) *** '' which is what i wrote , verbatim . 
  of course not . 
   * i 'm assuming you believe istanbul should be returned to the greeks as well . 
  * what a weird attempt at a strawman argument . 
  you can assume any old bullshit you want . 
  but the actual facts are inescapable . 
  sancta sophia is a very historically important christian monument the identity of which muslims tried to erase . 
  this is quite simply what happened . 
  muslim turks tried to hide the church 's christian character by gutting it , destroying its christian artefacts ( reportedly masterpieces all ) and then sticking some minarets to it , all so they could pretend that it was a mosque . 
  did that actually make it one ? 
  you seem to think so . 
  do go to the standing ruin that is today 's sancta sophia in constantinople . 
  though it still manages to be magnificent , think of the astounding cathedrals you can see today in rome and remember that sancta sophia was the greatest and most splendid of all churches , far greater than any in rome . 
  if you have any sense of history , this should break your heart . 
  of course , instead of addressing this very simple issue , you want to make this about some unrelated nationalistic nonsense . 
   * the hagia sophia is both an orthodox and a muslim historical monument * ... 
  it 's offensively absurd to place the christian character of for over a millennium the largest and most important cathedral of christendom ... and its distortion into some islamic mosque ( by destroying tremendous historical treasures and sticking minarets on it in trying to erase its christian identity ) , on the same footing . 
  what happened is like if you went to today 's sistine chapel , started destroying masterpieces ( statues , reliefs , crosses etc ) , started painting over and/or chiselling away michaelangelo 's ceiling , and then stuck some minarets around this thoroughly gutted shell of a chapel and then called it ... '' * a mosque * '' . 
  the hagia sophia is * a christian historical monument * the christian identity of which the muslims tried to erase . 
  there is a difference . 
  there seems to be this misconception that this church belonged to greece . 
  it did n't . 
  it never belonged '' * to our country * '' . 
  when sancta sophia was built , greece itself belonged to the roman empire . 
  if you want to call it ... '' * just an ancient ex-church * '' ... you can , but it was certainly not '' * of ours * '' . 
   * as a greek , i wo n't give a crap if they transform hagia sofia into a mosque to be honest . 
  * you may not give a crap , but more '' * as a moron * '' than '' * as a greek * '' . 
   * this building does n't belong to us for quite some centruries ( sic ) now . 
  * this building ** never ** '' * belonged to us * '' . 
  it was/is '' *** a cathedral *** '' that * belonged * to the christian religion . 
  if you are not christian , even the church in your own neighbourhood does n't belong to you . 
   * it 's on turkish land so may they have the freedom to do what they want with it . 
  * it does n't go quite like that . 
  when , in 2001 , a taliban muslim government in afghanistan decided to exercise their * freedom to do what they want * , they blew apart the magnificent buddhas of bamiyan , destroying thus 2,000 years of buddhist history . 
  according to you that 's fine . 
  well it 's not . 
  you can not just do any old fucking thing you want just because you occupy the land . 
   * maybe religious greeks will disagree with me because this building was once a church but ... * disagreeing with you has very little to do with religion . 
   * ... as an atheist i only view it as a historical monument which is n't on our ground anymore thus may they do whatever they want with it ... * that you 're being an atheist is not the problem here , that you do n't understand the problem , is the problem . 
  that church is not a * muslim * historical monument , nor a * buddhist * one , but a * christian * historical monument . 
  the * history * of '' * a historical monument * '' should be taken into account by whoever is on the ground . 
  they may ** not ** do whatever they want with it . 
   * ... nothing will change if they make it a mosque for me * . 
  as i 'm sure that for you nothing will change if the britons take druidic stonehenge and make it into an anglican church . 
  nonetheless , to convert unique , very old and very historically significant monuments to fit later religions is idiotic . 
  doing this kind of thing destroys history . 
  you should normally be allowed to visit mosques . 
  the blue mosque ( also in constantinople ) is quite the tourist attraction for example . 
  so converting sancta sophia into a mosque a would probably not change that . 
  hagia sophia , though it 's prevented by muslim turks from functioning as one , is a christian church . 
  it has always been one , since roman times , over a millennium ago , well before the existence any turkish republic or nationality . 
  if any religious services should be held , they should obviously be christian ones , not muslim ( !?! ) . 
  islamic turks can pretend that they can '' * convert * '' this church into some * museum * , a * mosque * , a * lavatory * or anything they want , but deep down they know that it ** is ** a christian church and that any distortion of its original sacred function is anathema and an insult against christianity and , if they believe , against god . 
  this church , that some turks will coyly explain * has nothing to do with christians * , is not just a christian church but one of , if not the , most historically significant church in christendom . 
  it 's at least on par in importance with st peter 's basilica in rome . 
  built on the orders of constantine the great , that 's the church where the very first christian emperors would go to . 
  it was for nearly a thousand years the largest christian cathedral in the world . 
  it can be said that this church , more than any other , launched christianity onto the world . 
  the question is not if it should be made into a museum or a mosque but why '' * \u1f09\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 \u03a3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 * '' , aka '' * sancta sophia * '' , aka the church of holy wisdom '' , is not allowed to function * as a church * , which is what it is , and possibly the most important one in the history of christianity . 
  cheers !, 
  turkey responsible for the deaths of 38 people in a 1994 attack on two kurdish villages . 
  ankara to pay $ 2.3 million in compensation . 
  additional amounts to plaintiffs who lost relatives or were injured . 
  $ 2.3 million for 38 people dead ? 
  ok . tens of thousands of people were killed in iraq and afghanistan . 
  can they also sue ? 
  putting up posters is acceptable . 
  beating people up is not . 
  whether one likes kke or not is irrelevant . 
  so , of course that getting your face smashed in response to erecting posters has little to do with '' * democracy * '' . 
  and i do n't mean to downplay the unacceptable violence of the event . 
  this kind of thuggery is deplorable . 
  it 's the political significance of something like that , however , that has been overplayed . 
  it 's more akin to hooliganism ... which i 'll grant you is not especially healthy either ... than to the rise of germany 's third reich , a ridiculous analogy that i nonetheless keep seeing . 
  let 's all run for our lives !, 
  in other news : thuggish hooligans supporting local football team * panathinaikos * , attaked some slightly less thuggish hooligans supporting local football team * olympiakos * . 
  the country is obviously becoming dangerous .
