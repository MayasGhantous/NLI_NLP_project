  to meet this emerging threat , the us pentagon is already working on bombing scenarios . 
  well , in terms of power-assistance , it 's the getting back out of the water that seems crucial . 
  so the getting into the water may even be made rather fun , with perhaps a controllable gravity-assisted slide . 
  and there is no reason why whatever system is used can not be more appropriate for a beach , with coloured plastics or whatever , instead of being so clunky and complicated and medical looking . 
  in any case , we are not going to redesign it here on reddit . 
   cheers !, 
  ... and the other half of greek businesses bribed the taxman, 
  the intention is good but this needs rethinking from scratch imho . 
  this solution reminds me of a joke that had nasa spending $ gazillions developing a pen that can write with no gravity ( the space pen ) while the russians simply used pencils . 
  this contraption , a mechanised chair-railroad going into the water , may allow `` unassisted '' access to swimming but it seems far from an elegant design . 
  the only good thing about it is the solar part . 
  other than that , it looks ugly , expensive , clunky , noisy and sure to break down soon , etc. 
  even without extensive research it 's easy to see that a simpler solution ( some type of ramp with no mechanical moving parts ) must surely exist . 
  because it will be expensive and sure to break down etc , this system is almost surely not going to be widely implemented . 
  and if this is all we offer , then people with disabilities will continue not to have unassisted access to the sea . 
  the most commonly used method ( taking someone with disabilities in one 's arms ) will remain the most common solution . 
  my two cents . 
  i guess you have a point . 
  and if this leads to a greater interest in history , it can only be a good thing , even if they somewhat distort things at first ( to achieve some sense of national identity ) . 
  all countries ' histories have gone through that to some extent . 
   '' * ... this corner of the balkans is suffering the shock of the new . 
  for this is more than just a city rejuvenation project . 
  almost every structure and statue is part of a wider ideological scheme to recast macedonia 's identity . 
  * many statues are already there , including , of course , the famous ( certainly not greek ) south slavic hero , alexander the great , while other ~ ~ bulgarians ~ ~ , huh , ~ ~ albanians ~ ~ , i mean '' * ethnic macedonians * '' like julius caesar , napoleon and bruce lee , are soon expected to be included . 
  greek here : it 's absolutely fine.these are basic jobs , not sought-after careers . 
  swedish staff means a better experience for swedish tourists . 
  they 'll thus be more likely to return . 
  this will in turn be better for the greek businesses that hire these swedes , who themselves will spend most of their money locally while living and working in greece ( not sent it home like most economic immigrants ) . 
  excellent all around !, 
  well , turkey is right next to europe so yes . 
  but us strategic concerns in the middle east and turkey 's membership in ( us controlled ) nato go a long way in explaining why the turks have been allowed to act with such impunity . 
  of course it 's europe that should have long ago told turks to get out of cyprus and in no uncertain terms , as in ' * ... or else * ! ', 
  this occupation could easily be considered a casus belli type of thing . 
  instead europeans are like ' * oh yeah , let 's talk about you joining europe ... * *** while your armies are occupying half of cyprus !, 
  *** ' and people wonder why putin did n't seem too concerned about europe when he just took a chunk out of of ukraine and annexed it . 
  what was europe going to do about it ... offer him membership ? 
  why should they grapple with anything ? 
  for what are basically very cynical geopolitical reasons , it does n't really matter what the turks do . 
  europe and especially the usa will continue [ allowing them to commit horrendous acts ] ( http://kurdistan.org/turkeys-war-crimes/ ) . 
  they 'll even actively help them commit their crimes most likely . 
  as we speak the turks are still [ militarily occupying half of cyprus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_invasion_of_cyprus ) , where they ethnic-cleansed the christians , brought in muslim turks , gave them the land and homes they stole from the cypriots , desecrated the christian churches and finally installed some bullshit regime that nobody recognises but them ... and with all of that ... nato says nothing and europe is talking to them about joining europe . 
  it fucking boggles the mind !, 
  also nobody , seems to notice that recently while they give the usual lip service to the fight against isis , [ they 're allied with and are helping isis ] ( http://www.thenation.com/article/turkey-is-using-isis-as-cover-for-its-war-against-kurdish-activists/ ) fight the kurds . 
  or rather , some people have noticed but the extent of the outrage is that this ' * complicates * ' things , [ as exemplified by a new york times ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/29/world/turkeys-focus-on-crushing-kurd-extremists-complicates-isis-efforts.html ) article that 's a prime example of turkish appeasement and apologism : it calls turkish-occupied kurdistan ' * turkey 's southeast , where kurds are a majority * ' ( ! ), 
  and even features a little speech by turkey 's head douchebag , tayyip erdogan , aww !, 
  for pete 's sake !, 
  nope , i think they 'll grapple with [ exactly nothing ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/hate_speech_in_turkish_news_outlets.jpg ) . 
  edit : links, 
  ' * public * ' wealth which has been paid for in taxes many times over and unquestionably belongs to the greek people , the inheritance of future generations , is now being sold to private interests so they can hoard themselves some private profits . 
  as an analogy , imagine that some villagers built a well so the village could have water . 
  imagine now that , some corrupt previous mayor borrowed lots of money and spent it on himself . 
  he 's now out of office . 
  but when he borrowed it was in the name of the village . 
  imagine furthermore that the local money-lender from whom the mayor borrowed convinced all nearby villages that he 's just ' * too big to fail * ' and that if the village that borrowed can not pay , they need to pick up the tab . 
  these imbeciles , instead of telling the money lender that he took a risk and lost , are now pressuring the village to sell its well to a speculator ... who happens to be a cousin and good friend of the money-lender . 
  this speculator will now be enriching himself by charging these villagers for every sip of their own water . 
  we 're watching a crime unfold in slow motion and it 's a good thin ~ ~ k ~ ~ g i 'm not a dictator because if i had the power , many heads would fall !, 
  edit : had written ' * it 's a good think * ', 
  i 'm responding to the title :  '' * pasok : we will not give a vote of confidence to the government * ' . 
  pasok should simply shut the fuck up , its politicians lucky not to be in jail ( or worse ) . 
  it 's a matter of degree i guess . 
  there must certainly be * some * corrupt politicians everywhere . 
  but here , basically the entire political party was involved . 
  and the fraud was routine and known ( or strongly suspected ) to be taking place by almost everyone , a * wink wink , nudge nudge * kind of situation . 
  that 's * got * to be rare !, 
  pasok giving a * vote of confidence * sound like a joke . 
  pasok was , probably still is , a kind of criminal organisation , the main function of which was to acquire political offices from which to defraud the greek state ( and therefore people ) . 
  its politicians were almost by definition corrupt . 
  they 're the main culprit ( together with n.d. to some extent ) for the current debt situation . 
  i 'm surprised that so few are in jail . 
   the turkish nationalists used this fact to fuel their ( reasonable ) interpretation of the war as a war of independence . 
  far from ' * reasonable * ' !, 
  the ottoman had been the occupying power ( of greek , armenian , kurdish peoples etc. ) . 
  they still are by the way . 
  have you seen a map of kurdistan ? 
  so , that it was a war , no problem ... but one of turks * gaining independence * ? 
  that 's a joke !, 
  it 's like if germany after their reversal of fortune during the second world war ( where they went from aggressor to that of defending themselves ) suddenly called wwii , ' * the war for german independence !, 
  for pete 's sake !, 
  of course not . 
  and different versions of history can be useful in forcing the re-examination of possible prejudices . 
  however , and call me crazy , but i nonetheless do imagine history as ( at least the attempt at ) an objectively accurate description of events ( contrasted to mythology ) . 
  so , some versions are fairly easy to spot as being complete ( usually nationalistic ) bullshit . 
  of course not . 
  aghia sophia is indeed a christian cathedral , designed and built as such ... but which the ottomans ( after gutting it ) then tried to pass off as a mosque . 
  that they did that and used its design as the basis for that of mosques is part of the same mentality that had them use the byzantine star and crescent as their own . 
  edit : orthography, 
  that unlikely ' * tengrist roots * ' business is simply bullshit . 
  of course that you took the star and crescent from the byzantines . 
  there 's no possible doubt . 
  you can actually examine byzantine coins with the star and crescent right on them ... dating from centuries before any turkish hordes showed up . 
  the byzantine connection is so clear cut and unambiguous that it boggles the mind that this should even be a matter of controversy ** at all ** . 
  yeah right !, 
  nope , the turks simply appropriated constantinople 's star and crescent . 
  it was already there and so they just passed it off as their own . 
  because that 's exactly what they did with everything else . 
  that 's exactly how they took aghia sophia , a major christian cathedral , and then not just pretended it was a mosque but copied it so much that all their mosques ended up looking like it . 
  no different here . 
  nope . 
  the greeks had been using the symbolism centuries before even that .
