  and in any case , just hold on a second here ... the xiongnu ? 
  like north of china and stuff ? 
   look , it 's rather clear at least to me that you seek to deny the rather straightforward connection to byzantium in order to instead find a turkish one , at all cost . 
  but trying to force such a connection is disingenuous . 
  seriously , what do the xiongnu have to do with constantinople ( which would become the ottomans ' capital city ) ? 
   ' * shamelessly stolen from wikipedia * ' ? 
  what does that even mean ? 
  * what * was stolen ? 
  what ' s the implication here ? 
  in the meantime , what you call ' * proof * ' is from ** 576-600 ad ** !, 
  :d i this a joke ? 
  we 're talking many centuries almost three quarters of a millennium ( ! ), 
  ** after ** the unquestionable use of the symbolism on byzantine coins : artemis on one side and a crescent and a six-rayed star on the reverse !, 
  hello ?!, 
  and then , in 330 ad , byzantium emperor constantine used the symbol again while rededicating constantinople to the christian virgin mary , and again centuries before your turkic khaganates . 
  so ** of course ** that the star and crescent was there ** before ** islam . 
  it had ** absolutely nothing to do with islam ** . 
  it had to do with greco-roman and then christian symbolism both pre-dating ( and by a long long time ) islam as well as any khaganate kebabs . 
  the fuck ? 
  wait , such attacks were related to peoples liberating themselves * from * the turks , * not * the other way around . 
  are you trying to say that * the turks liberated themselves from the armenians * for example ? 
  [ k ] ( http://www.turkishnews.com/en/content/2013/04/08/star-and-crescent/ ), 
  right !, 
  so the turks freed themselves from the greek , armenian etc. 
  they thus gained their ' * independence * to the valorous cries of ' * freedom or death ! * ' ? 
  is this a joke or is this how history is actually taught there ? 
  kebab leader 's dream is made-up bull for the purposes of kebab nationalism . 
  the crescent symbolised byzantium and honoured the goddess artemis/diana and the star came to symbolise the virgin mary . 
  for example : [ first century bce byzantine coin ] ( http://www.livius.org/a/turkey/istanbul/byzantium_coin_sibce.jpg ) . 
  it was used on the flag of constantinople . 
  edit : moved link, 
  not to mention that this ' ** europe ** in massive letters at the top of the page ' ... is at the top of a page of a ** us site ** , owned and managed by ** usa ** ns and hosted ( ostensibly as a matter of courtesy ) ** in the usa ** . 
  ' * greko-turkish war aka turkish war of independence . * ' ? 
  that 's rather peculiar , is n't it ? 
  * turkish independence * ... from whom ? 
  brains !, 
  this . 
  finally . 
  well , they 're all fairly close to each other , as both latin and cyrillic are related and almost directly derived from the greek alphabet and so the differences can easily be learned during a visit . 
   `` * a cynic is a man who knows the price of everything , and the value of nothing . 
   * and how are you defining ` roman ' ? 
  * well , the ' * byzantine * ' emperor would have called himself a ' * roman * ' emperor ... and so would the people in his empire called themselves ' * romans * ' . 
  the term still survives today as ' * romios * ' . 
  greece was just another conquered land within that empire . 
  ' * byzantine * ' is a later made up term based on the name of the city-state ( byzantium ) that was there before ' * nova roma * ' ( aka ' * constantinople * ' ) was established by roman emperor constantine ... emperor of * the whole roman empire * ( both western and eastern ) . 
  as an interesting side note , the term ' * hellene * ' ( the greek term for ' * greek * ' ) would , in that empire , come to refer to those following the traditional olympic religion , the one in place before constantine took his mother 's cult and made it the imperial religion of the whole roman world . 
   * the people , language , and variety of christianity was greek . 
  * thanks largely to the conquests of alexander of macedon , greek became the most widespread language in a huge area which included the balkan and anatolian peninsulae . 
  but so what ? 
  are the * californians * ' * britons * ' just because they speak ' * english * ' ? 
  of course not . 
  beyond language and cultural influence , any previous greek empires ( alexander and his successors , ptolemaic cleopatra etc. ), 
  had long been overtaken by roman military power . 
  also , it 's not that the ' * variety of christianity * ' was ' * greek * ' . 
  it 's more exactly the other way around : greece was a conquered part of the roman empire which fell under the eastern roman part . 
  it simply therefore followed that specific tradition . 
   * is there some reason you do n't wish to accept the greek character of the christian greek empire ? 
  * an attempt at historical accuracy ? 
   * they called themselves roman as synonymous with a christian , but they were n't latins . 
  * no , they called themselves * roman * as synonymous with being members of the roman empire , just as latin members in old rome might , all of them doing so ... * before * ... becoming christian . 
   * otherwise , i fail to see why they holy roman empire are n't called romans , either . 
  moving a capital city means little , and it ceased to be ` roman ' when italy was lost . 
  * well , when he established ' * nova roma * ' ( new rome ) as the new capital of his empire , emperor constantine did so as the sole uncontested roman emperor ** of the entire roman empire ** . 
  and though the greek language was most commonly used in the eastern part of that empire , neither its emperor , nor the empire 's people were specifically ' * greek * ' ( well some , the * graeci * , were ) . 
  cheers !, 
  ... ottomans copies of * greek * maps ? 
  well , though they mostly spoke greek there , the ' * byzantine * ' empire ( from the libraries of which the ottomans looted the maps ) was * roman * . 
  ... ottomans copies of * roman * maps !, 
  i agree very much and let me share a couple of * far-out * tangents : about education : education increasingly , even in europe , consists apparently of just getting the training necessary to compete in ' * the job markets * ' . 
  and the resulting mindless drones can not fathom why they should study ancient greek or latter german thinkers . 
  the job market has no use for them . 
  and so , how many people can you talk to who know * why * ' * democracy * ' ( which they claim to like ) is considered a good system , and how and why it * necessarily * arose from philosophy ? 
  of course , education is actually a goal in itself . 
  concepts form the arsenal required for critical thought . 
  understanding the history of human thought is necessary to become a full human being , one worthy of the name ' * sapiens * ' . 
  about germany : you , i 'm sure , are aware that media corporations and politicians ( unwittingly ? ), 
  working for and pushing the interests of international financiers ( instead of that of their citizens ) is not a specifically german phenomenon . 
  germany is however nonetheless specifically interesting . 
  after the wwii fall of germany , the country was divided between the us and soviet spheres of influence , where germans were set up to fight each other , between countrymen ( over * capitalism * and * communism * , two moronic materialist mentalities ) . 
  something very similar occurred in greece and much of europe , and not only . 
  how did we ever let this nonsense go on for so long ? 
  and it 's * still * going on !, 
  the absurdity of it boggles the mind . 
  this could * not * have happened had many more people been more or rather better educated . 
  cheers !, 
  ps ) instead of societies enjoying more free time , more education and a better quality of life thanks to the reduction in the need for labour ( increasingly brought about by automation through computers and robots ) we have ourselves the opposite result . 
  instead of having the machines become the new ' * slaves * ' ( allowing humans to reach heights in science , art and philosophy etc. 
  ) , we stuck most people a systemic need for constant debt and the resulting constant systemic need for ' * growth * ' , i.e. 
  more and more meaningless and useless work . 
  you can still see politicians boasting about ' * creating jobs * ' !, 
  omg , the stupidity !, 
  they should seek to be * eliminating * jobs !, 
  but your average supposedly modern man is such a ( philosophically ) uneducated imbecile that he thinks that the only two choices available to him is to either become a necessarily ( practical ) slave himself or to perish . 
  well , he 's kind of right in the sense that , stupid though it is , it 's indeed how we set things up for most people . 
  finally !, 
  i 've always perceived germans as philhellenes ( at least the classically educated ones ) . 
  and so it threw me for a loop when i saw so many in germany being led into a frenzy against greece and greeks , foaming at the mouth against democracy itself ... all of it , ironically enough , in support of [ banking interests seeking to force people into * debt-slavery * ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/afontevecchia/2012/02/21/greek-bailout-deal-a-farce-to-benefit-banks-at-the-expense-of-greece/ ) . 
  france and england also helped to say the least ( [ example ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_navarino ) ) during the war of independence . 
  may i suggest ' * prostitutes * ' as less vulgar/judgemental/demeaning english word and ... wat ? 
  * a lot * of jokes ?
