  and i 've somehow never heard one . 
  must be hanging out with the wrong crowd . 
  if engendering the , as you put it , * complete destruction * of your own country , is not * stupidity * , well what can i tell you ? 
  indeed , thanks you for that . 
  [ because ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3dhncw/sch%c3%a4uble_insists_greece_should_temporarily_exit/ct5dte2 ), 
  right , and ... * why * was germany bombed into poverty again ? 
  look : if when * i * could not pay my debts to you and , though you were not happy about it , you said you 'd forgive that debt ... 
  if when * you * then can not pay your debt to me , i start preaching about the sanctity of debt and screaming about the need to force austerity ... you might very well say : ` you 're just so convincing . 
  incidentally , remember that debt you owed me ? 
  you 'll pay it back of course and with interest . 
  and then suddenly i might be like : ' * well that 's different ... * ' seems familiar at all ? 
  not sure if or when it did or not went . 
  from your link : [ war debt relief of major european countries as a share of gdp in 1934 ] ( http://www.voxeu.org/sites/default/files/image/frommay2014/reinhart%20fig1b.png ), 
  [ why !, 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/08/business/economy/germanys-debt-history-echoed-in-greece.html ), 
  right !, 
  that germany ended up ' * completely destroyed * ' was of course * not * due to germany being run by ' * stupid people * ' . 
  i 'm not familiar with the 1934 debt , only the 1953 one ( [ nyt article ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/08/business/economy/germanys-debt-history-echoed-in-greece.html ) ) , please elaborate . 
  germany is now morally obliged to repay nazi debt cancelled in 1953 ... with interest !, 
   * you should check his other terrible pieces too ... * :d maybe some other time . 
  i ca n't cause that dutch caricature hit too close to home ... that guy looks * exactly * like me and the rest of my family , even my wife and kids , so ... 
  well , you 're asking whether greeks are ' * ethnically * ' close to the turks ( as opposed to what , the italians or the bulgarians ) ? 
  seriously ? 
  who gives a fuck ? 
  i was referring to the * offensiveness * of that caricature . 
  a greek artist hoping to publish in a 2015 mainstream publication might consider it too offensive to caricature the turks in the way that that dutch artist has caricatured the greeks . 
  generally , a good rule of thumb about ' * ethnic * ' caricatures/stereotypes , ( especially from the dutch , or other * not-too-reluctant * wwii collaborators ... see what i did here ? 
  ) , is to consider whether it would be acceptable to similarly caricature/stereotype the jews . 
  that one looks like something out of * der st\u00fcrmer * . 
  cheers !, 
  [ did you say something ? 
  ] ( http://a395.idata.over-blog.com/2/16/88/78/caricature-francais.jpg ), 
  far from it . 
  looks like an offensive caricature of * a turk * , which if drawn by a greek artist might get him accusations of racism . 
  dijsselbloem and sch\u00e4uble , these mean , corrupt and stupid little men , mental and ethical midgets both , should have been the ones to resign . 
  how does that help greece ? 
  it avoids another idiotic and unsustainable ' * extend and pretend * ' fiasco . 
  these just keep greece in a constant state of imminent catastrophe . 
  enough of that !, 
  your apparent position is to avoid the substance , ostensibly because you must necessarily concede dr varoufakis ' position in economics terms . 
  you seem to argue in terms of power relations ... that despite being right ( ! ), 
  this greek government should sign whatever deal ( sustainable or not ) is put before them . 
  sorry but if making the deal sustainable ** as it must be ** is not acceptable to the institutions ... well ... what can we do ? 
  those of us who are not terrified by the various threats flying about ( some call the ` yes ' vote the ' * yes effendi * ' vote ) consider that we 'll find * some * way do deal with the situation ... without ' * partners * ' that seem to be anything but . 
   * i 've read more statements , proposals and agendas from them than from any party in my country . 
  yet , i have absolutely no idea what their vision for a new and improved greece is ... buzzwords ... populism ... empty phrases * . 
  seriously ? 
  i 'm so fucking tired of the level of bullshit , propaganda and idiocy i have to witness about this . 
  so , here ya go about their ' * vision * ' , which is almost childishly simple : incredible as it may seem , this government is being pressured to sign a deal that 's technically ** un ** - ** sus ** - ** tain ** - ** able ** , a deal just like the moronically catastrophic ones signed by previous governments . 
  that 's not a question of ideology but just a technical matter . 
  the unsustainability issue was constantly being pointed out by dr varoufakis ( who called the deal ' * extend and pretend * ' ) but he was being ignored and called ' * petulant * ' etc. 
  but he was right . 
  but it 's only after the leaking of secret imf documents revealing exactly that , that the imf finally admitted that this was indeed the case . 
  basically , the greek government 's position was and is that they wo n't sign as deal unless it 's ** re ** - ** struc ** - ** tured ** to make it ** sus ** - ** tain ** - ** able ** . 
  that 's it . 
  ** that ** is what dr varoufakis is asking ... ** that ** 's ' * the vision * ' . 
  simple . 
  i think he might very well be as most if not all of the arguments against his position , that i 've seen so far , seem disingenuous . 
  the continued ( but by seemingly general agreement * unsustainable * ) combination of austerity and * debt relief * is not the same as * restructuring * that debt as to finally make it * sustainable * , the part that seems to actually be at the crux of the matter . 
  well since everyone agrees , then let 's everyone also agree to restructure that debt so it 's ... * sustainable * . 
  it unfortunately does seem to be the case , which makes it so maddening !, 
  it 's hard to believe that this article was published in the washington post . 
  wtf is going on ? 
  this must be one of the stupidest and most emptily speculative pieces i 've ever read :  ' * suppose senior government officials in greece had concluded that the euro was a failed experiment , that the rest of the continent would never extend reasonable terms to their country and would instead doom it to perpetual recession , and that the only way to save greece from disaster -- and europe , too -- was to begin the process of unwinding the common currency . 
  * ' seriously ? 
  i 've seen conspiracy theory rags with less idiotic analyses . 
  the hard part for me was to try and * suppose * that the author ( max ehrenfreund ) is neither a complete imbecile nor a shill . 
  the subject matter of his article is ... * yet another speculative opinion piece * , itself with no content whatsoever ... a grotesque simon nixon character assassination against varoufakis ( weasel words and all ) :  ' * ... the rest of the world is busily calling tsipras and his advisers na\u00efve and incompetent etc * ' . 
  oh , so it 's ' * the rest of the world * ' , not you , who 's trying to give an impression of naivete and incompetence ... riiight !, 
  :d compare and contrast this to the sincerity , level of discourse and seriousness of [ dr varoufakis ' bloomberg interview ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2015-07-02/varoufakis-says-he-will-quit-if-greeks-vote-yes - ) . 
  sorry to break up your circlejerk . 
  cheers !, 
  edit : word change and link to the full interview ( not just edited blurbs ), 
  this is what i commented on [ another post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3buzcl/bloomberg_interview_varoufakis_says_he_will_quit/ ) about that exact same interview : dr varoufakis holds that the currently proposed agreement is an unsustainable ' * extend and pretend * ' deal that would simply push the crisis just a little further into the future , whereas his proposed ' * no * ' vote signifies that the greek people agree with him that no viable deal can be made without restructuring the debt . 
  edit : and the peculiar thing is that the imf seems to secretly agree with varoufakis ' analysis of the crisis : [ secret imf documents : austerity measures would still leave greece with unsustainable debt . 
  secret documents show greece would face an unsustainable level of debt by 2030 even if it signs up to the full package of tax and spending reforms demanded of it .

   ' * ... the problem of people getting degrees in unproductive fields * . 
  right !, 
  someone once wrote :  * it sometimes seems quite possible that the entire universe was created for vincenzo bellini to exist in order to compose norma , so that one day in 1958 maria callas would sing [ casta diva ] ( https://youtu.be/b-9ivuekrei ) !, 
  * i do n't know about that , but how poor and dreary life would be in a world where people in the * unproductive * fields , like sartre , mozart or van gogh for example , had n't existed . 
  while on the other hand , you can take the whole lot of wallstreet investors , bankers , brokers , financial managers and all the assorted bloodsucking and useless parasites that some economics-major imbecile might consider ' * productive * ' and make them all suddenly disappear ... and you might suddenly find the world a better place . 
  cheers !, 
  i 'm not sure we disagree on the substance : part of the problem is indeed that varoufakis ' negotiation position ( asking for money ) and his lack of submissive behaviour ( which seems to be perceived as a large ego ) do not fit . 
  i simply deplore that ' * adapting his ego * ' should be required . 
  varoufakis is a somewhat idealistic ( naive ? ), 
  but highly intelligent conceptual type , who 's mostly comfortable with abstractions . 
  european politicians on the other hand seem to often think less in terms of ideas and more in terms of power relations : since greece is the one to owe money , they expect greek officials to be cajoling , humbly pleading and obsequiously begging them ... and certainly not lecturing . 
  thing is that varoufakis does n't really get this kind of ' * alpha vs beta * ' dominance-games , though these are so basic as to be mostly characteristic of chimpanzee societies . 
  furthermore , varoufakis considers that the current first-time government ( which he represents ) is * not * responsible for greece 's debt situation . 
  both of the major parties who were ( responsible for the debt ) were kicked out in the elections , something which was considered impossible until recently . 
  nonetheless an absurd amount of this government 's budget must go to repay that debt , making his job very difficult . 
  now , if europe is to mean anything , he should get every possible help to resolve the situation . 
  he 's not getting it . 
  instead he 's getting primate-like reactions for his lack of submissiveness . 
  so he ( rightly ) condescends to the bureaucrats whose idiotic policies ( and hidden behind the door dealmaking ) keep the whole of europe ( not just greece ) struggling and economically underperforming .
