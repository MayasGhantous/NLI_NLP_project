  it may very well be that the fact that varoufakis is unanimously hated by these morons is not an indictment of varoufakis but rather of europe 's lack of belief in its own vision and principles . 
  cheers !, 
  ' * propose to convince them * ' ? 
  now , decades behind events ? 
  what do you think the whole european project is about ? 
  what have so many people being trying to do all these years ? 
  incidentally , given the myriad obstacles , if and ( hopefully ) when a powerful european union does succeed for good , it might be considered the greatest achievement in the history of humankind . 
  woosh !, 
  the point was ... by what miracle did some russians end up first in space ? 
  by tech-looting operations like * osoaviakhim * etc. , and soviet ' * trophy brigades * ' , something reflected by similar us operations , with various code names like * alsos * , * lusty * , * epsilon * or * paperclip * . 
  originally , it was to his countryman , erich warsitz , whom you 've almost certainly never heard of , but who was the first man to ever fly a jet and also the first to fly a rocket-plane , that von braun had told : '' * you 'll become a famous man when we later fly to the moon , with you at the helm ! * '' . 
  incidentally , as we all ( hopefully ) know , von braun ended up working for the us ... while warsitz simply refused to work for the ussr , so he was sentenced to forced-labour for war crimes . 
  cheers !, 
  edit : clarity, 
  well , no question !, 
   we looted europe ? 
  if by ' * we * ' you mean the us and the soviets , then yes . 
  hint : the first man in space was russian . 
  indeed i do . 
  but the soviets did n't just * stop with east germany * . 
  the division of europe along the us-soviet spheres of influence was agreed upon between them ahead of time . 
  i 'm glad you like it . 
  and one need n't use * made up words * : * ~ ~ corporocracy ~ ~ * : [ ' * corporatocracy * ' ] ( http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/corporatocracy ) . 
  i had just skipped the ' * rat * ' syllable . 
  thankfully * you * came along . 
  now , i had perhaps expected accusations of hyperbole , but not my logic being faulted , so ... should europe ** not ** seriously start determining its fate independently of various barbaric idiots currently pushing others around ? 
  ** both ** of the ' * superpowers * ' that arose post-wwii are a problem . 
  we just keep perpetuating the bizarre , unnatural and actually harmful-for-europe situation that resulted when newly-powerful morons took a completely destroyed and looted europe ( even the scientists were taken ) , and divided it along their spheres of influence . 
  there 's no doubt that putin 's russia is bullying ukraine . 
  but that 's what russians do . 
  ask almost any of their neighbours . 
  ' * scratch a russian ... !, 
  * ' and all that . 
  but the point about the us troops in ~ europe is also valid !, 
  that nato ' * alliance * ' seems more like it 's just some us protection-racket . 
  the us itself seems to be turning into some rabid hypermilitary * corporocracy * for lack of a better term , a kind of ' * pinochet on steroids !, 
  * ' police-state . 
  europe needs to seriously start determining its fate independently of ** any ** of the barbaric idiots currently pushing others around . 
  cheers !, 
  that 's , unfortunately , exactly right . 
  greek newborns are laden from day one of their life with between 30 and 50 thousand euros of debt ... each ... to pay for funds stolen by a collusion of corrupt greek and european politicians and banking interests ( goldman sacks etc. ), 
  ... for example germany getting billions of greek taxpayer money in exchange for useless submarines that lean to one side ( not a joke ) . 
  in the meantime greece is required to take care of some completely unrelated pseudo - ' * refugees * ' into europe ( economic immigrants who decided to travel to far away europe due to its social services , well after leaving danger zones and finding safety in places like turkey ) . 
  european politicians are not working for european people but for foreign financial/banking interests . 
  they 're simply implementing ' * debt slavery * ' upon greece first and soon the whole of europe . 
  because the target is not greece but europe . 
  greece is just the weakest link . 
  so , what 's there to negotiate ? 
  these negotiations are a kind of sham . 
  yeah ... ` lol ' ... how very dismissive . 
  all of this is due to ' * islamophobia * ' ( ! ), 
  or racism no doubt . 
  for pete 's sake !, 
  never mind that turkey 's islamic regime ** is ** routinely invading greek/european airspace , aiding isis ( and murdering the kurds who are fighting them ) , and illegally occupying half of cyprus ( where they 've installed some bullshit regime that nobody in the world recognises except turkey of course ) ... with their military ( tanks , jets etc , all included ) sitting there ... for decades . 
  now they 're like ... oh no some russian jet fighting isis overflew our border for a sec ( actually , turkish-occupied kurdistan , to boot ) ... let 's start shooting !, 
  i admire russian sangfroid . 
  that turks ...  ... ' * really ca n't do anything and justify it since someone eventually will pull one of those cards to refute our argument * ' ... ... is due to no other reason that these things ** are ** happening . 
  due to geopolitical reasons turkish regimes have been allowed time and time again to get away with a lot of crap , with ' * the west * ' trying its best to pretend not to notice ... ... so it 's a bit rich to try and dismiss this with an attitude of ... * lol , people here are just so anti-turkish !, 
  i 've read numerous time about some eu states putting pressure on others about the refugee crisis as an example . 
  each country should be able to determine what they feel they can handle or even if they wish to take in any at all . 
  being part of the eu seems to mean relinquishing their sovereignty . 
  well , yes , in the same way that in the us there are both state laws and federal laws . 
  being part of the us seems to mean relinquishing their sovereignty too . 
  that 's the price of being part of a union . 
  but i agree that the way it works in europe has ** much ** room for improvement . 
   the five wealthiest gulf nations have n't taken any . 
  and plenty other middle eastern countries have n't either . 
  it 's a problem being shifted to the west that out a burden on social services and the economy . 
  yet countries with similar cultural background refuse to take any in most cases . 
  i complete agree . 
  that 's strange , to begin with . 
  and it certainly is unacceptable . 
  i do n't think all the countries joining together to become the eu was a good idea . 
  i disagree . 
  europe is de facto one entity . 
  it 's therefore natural for it also be one de jure . 
  of course , the greatness of it also creates its own most difficult obstacle to overcome in order to achieve the vision : the idea is to have an entity made up of many different states ... but unlike in the us , without destroying each unique sense of history , culture , language , food , wine , mentality , etc. 
  in the usa , which is culturally an european colony , you do n't have that problem because all ( native ) american cultures have essentially been wiped out . 
  there is a predominant ( european immigrant ) culture that has essentially imposed itself on everything . 
  and so everybody eats the same stuff , drinks the same stuff , reads the same stuff and watches the same stuff , any ' * differences * ' superficial and illusory , mostly matters of corporate branding of the type : '' * mc donalds or burger king , coke or pepsi , fox or cnn ... ? 
  * ' this has made things simpler than in europe where everything has to account for over twenty languages and cultures . 
  years ago i was fascinated by how new yorkers would fatalistically accept some of their neighbourhoods to be dangerous ( ' * harlem * ` at the time ) . 
  this seemed so exotic , interesting and adventurous . 
  i liked it because it was not boring like the bland homogeneity and safety i took for granted . 
  well , the model has been applied worldwide it seems . 
  having countries and cities each essentially reflecting an individual and unique culture is becoming rarer . 
  the differences between large western cities are more and more a matter of superficiality , this or that landmark , but essentially all becoming more and more like ny , with shocking extremes in wealth and poverty , a permanent homeless class and of course a bunch of multi/no-culture ethnic / ' * mongrel * ' gettoes . 
  never mind archaeological museums , athens has now become quite ... ' * interesting * ' ... in anthropological terms also . 
  of course , all people have to live . 
  and we need to find a way to accommodate each other . 
  and so , is this tendency necessary a bad thing ? 
  well , i think so . 
  i like the individual culture of each european country . 
  i find the macdonaldisation of culture favoured in the us distasteful . 
  people need to try harder to d fix their own countries before moving to european countries , often bringing along with them the main cause of the problems they are fleeing from ( the medieval stupidity of islam ) . 
  anyway , i do n't know about austria and denmark , but in athens , greece , some neighbourhoods are already considered * no-go * for greeks past sun-down . 
  are they * actually * dangerous or is this just a matter of perception ? 
  i 'm not absolutely sure but i 'm not going to test it . 
  of course , not too long ago it was the * albanians * whom many greeks considered to be criminals ( almost by default ) . 
  many indeed were ( huge albanian drugs and pimping mafia ) .
