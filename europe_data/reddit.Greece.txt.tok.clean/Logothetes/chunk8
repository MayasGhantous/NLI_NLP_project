  however the prejudice subsided as many albanians proved honest , intelligent and hard working . 
  and their children now consider themselves ' * greek * '' . 
  but here 's the hitch , not the muslim ones !, 
  these live in greece but somehow seem to at the same time hate greece . 
  and you just want to go : ' * but why the fuck are you here then ? 
  ah , poor well-meaning politically correct lemmings !, 
  they are like unaware children . 
  i wonder if before 1453 people in constantinople marched to show support for the innumerable islamic hordes advancing upon them , holding up posters reading `` in with the ottomans , out with the romans '' and `` no walls around europe '' . 
  in any case , when the saracens did finally take over that great european city , they murdered christians for three whole days non-stop and , after first desecrating the great christian cathedrals ( the very ones that had launched christianity upon the world ) to then pretend they were actually islamic mosques ( as they still do ) , they spent the centuries since slowly but surely ethnically and culturally ' * dirtying * ' the place ( ' * cleansing * ' being perhaps too much of a misnomer ) . 
  idiots !, 
  like ... you perhaps ? 
  yes . 
  the interesting part is why . 
  it seems that europe 's politicians ( whose only function was supposed to be to look out for the interests of citizens ) collude instead with private financial interests to erase most private and institutional losses and to pass them on to greece 's and europe 's citizens ( who had n't invested in any bonds ) , through their taxes ... in yet another instance of ' * private profits but public risks * ' . 
  there seems to be a ( purposeful ? ), 
  confusion as to the function of things . 
  a society does ** not ** , as many seem to believe , exist in order to service banks etc. 
  it 's the other way around . 
  it 's banks and financial services etc. 
  that only exist in order to facilitate exchanges etc. 
  within a society of people ... and to thus help make that society better . 
  once this is understood , that a society has been economically destroyed to prop-up the financial system and that real children have had their futures and lives ruined through an unsustainable debt-at-perpetuity regime ( to stick these kids into ) ... the whole thing in order to service the ' * financial services * ' industry and its virtual funds ( the value of which is derived from debt itself ) ... should shock people . 
  and yet ... ' * meh * ' !, 
   yeah that 's great and all , but defaulting was the other option . 
  no , not * the * other option . 
  it was * one * of the other options . 
  another option was the option proposed by varoufakis ( i have n't read his new book but expect it in a few days ) and rejected by sch\u00e4uble and the rest of that ilk of ' * european * ' politicians who seem to be working less for the european people and more for corporate and banking interests . 
  in any case , default would have been horrendous for greece 's population in the short term but probably preferable in the long run ... at least than the absurd economy-and-people-destroying regime being implemented right now . 
  currently , and for many years now , every greek newborn has been made to be * born in debt ( !, 
  ) * to the financial world , from day one , for many tens of thousands of euros . 
  ' * welcome to the world , now see , there 's this thing called the financial system ... in any case ... * *** pay the fuck up ! *** ' . 
  and all of this because we 've decided that ( in order for the bizarre financial system that we 've somehow implement upon ourselves not to collapse upon itself ) * taxpayers ( !, 
  ) * , starting with the greek people , needed to save investors from the risks they took . 
   and defaulting meant greece would need a balanced budget which under the current circumstances it barely can before debt repayment along with many other short and long term ramification throughout the eurozone . 
  well , the greeks got rid of both of the ostensibly corrupt and sold-out political parties that had been ruling greece almost since after wwii ( something akin to the people of the usa kicking both the democratic and republican parties out of their governments and electing something like the greens ) ... but then that new and inexperience party was ** also ** blackmailed into signing the very same kind of criminal regime that it was elected to stand up against ... leading varoufakis to resign from his government . 
  the current government is a joke . 
  never mind even the pretence at democracy , the financial world is what has been dictating policies and ruling therefore greece ... for years now . 
   the investors took a huge haircut of 53.5 % to let greece avoid a default because of their own poor spending practices and greece is still struggling to get by . 
  yeah well we ' re of course all very deeply concerned for the investors ... however in order to pay them one has to destroy an economy , to tax people to ( often literal ) death and to steal the money that people thought they had been paying all their lives for social security , retirement etc. 
   at this point the investors are almost completely out of greece and the debt is owned by the eu and it 's member states ... that is itself a crime . 
  how and why and by what logic are european citizens responsible to cover through their taxes the investment losses of the financial system ... which , incidentally , lobbies ( aka buys-up corrupt politicians ) non-stop to have governments and public interest stay ** out ** of their affairs . 
   the bailouts at this point are the eu loaning the money required to pay off the loans it 's already owed . 
  exactly ... its ' complete absurdity !, 
  edit : typos , so many typos , for example ... those awful corporate and ' * baking * ' interests :d , as opposed to ' * banking * ' . 
  you obviously have a thing against greece . 
  your comments are basically a series of meaningless attacks on the country . 
  what 's the deal ? 
  alternative title : '' *** greek government submits to banks , ignores its citizens *** . '', 
  i agree that '' * a company can exist only if it can sell it [ 's ] products * '' . 
  but the specific cancer medicine they distribute here is priced , not relative to their cost ( which is relatively low ) , but according to an analysis over the maximum profit that can be squeezed out the market . 
  i 've read figures of up to $ 30,000.00 per eight week treatment . 
  and do n't forget , furthermore , that this is a company that has previously been convicted of price fixing . 
  seriously : fuck them !, 
   it 's a company not a charity how much evil been hidden behind such benign sounding phrases . 
  all the assholes have used some version of this : monsanto , merck , halliburton ... 
  they all somehow believe that you can be a depraved piece of shit ... as long as you do it * to make money * !, 
  this is somehow an excuse for the most disgusting of behaviours . 
  in their minds being motivated by ** greed ** , does not make things worse but ok : '' * i , ( by action or inaction ) killed your family , but it 's ok because i did it for profit !, 
  * '' wtf !, 
  sorry but that does n't cut it . 
  it 's even somewhat insane for people to even think like that . 
  these guys are scum , ** period ** !, 
  * distributed by, 
  nothing surprising here . 
  merck kgaa , are convicted crooks , literally . 
  this company was once caught and had to plead guilty ( and was convicted ) in an international vitamin price-fixing [ ** conspiracy ** ] ( http://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/00549.html ) . 
  we are talking scumbags here . 
  do n't expect them to put lives before money . 
  they can go fuck themselves !, 
  edit : link, 
  golden dawn does bother me . 
  skin-heads also bother me . 
  many things in the world bother me . 
  however , a european neo-nazi phenomenon does not '' ** worry ** '' me . 
  and that 's the thing !, 
  why ? 
  well , though i agree with you that democracy requires constant vigilance , golden dawn is just too `` graphic '' , too ridiculous , too obvious . 
  we all know , deep down , that such parties will remain marginal . 
  granted , if i 'm right about this , no harm done by us overreacting but that if you are right ... well ... fuuuck !, 
  but seriously , skinhead neo-nazis will ** not ** take over greece ( or any other modern european country ) ... 
  ** period !, 
  ** you know that . 
  i know that . 
  the press ** must ** know that . 
  and yet , with screaming headlines , the press seems to pretend otherwise . 
  of course that we need to keep an eye on them , but a disproportionate emphasis on ideologically dead-end groups like golden dawn seems suspect to me . 
  it feels like a misdirection/distraction from real issues and/or the perpetrators behind these issues . 
  that whole '' * greece is becoming fascist !, 
  * '' hysteria feels somewhat suspect to me . 
  i ca n't quite put my finger on it , but something is wrong with it . 
  it 's simply too idiotic . 
  what has happened , in a nutshell , is that , because of the crisis , the disillusioned vote rose in greece . 
  as a result , some right-wing thugs called `` golden dawn gained in the polls ( still under 10 % , though more than they normally should ) . 
  they had addressed the problem of immigration , something the others avoided . 
  and this went a long way towards getting them enough votes to be lifted from complete obscurity . 
  but so what ? 
  nobody ** seriously ** believes that a political party mimicking the slogans , imagery and symbolism of the 1930 's ( !!! ), 
  could ** actually ** take over . 
  for all their pompous role-playing , all such groups are simply too ridiculous to be much more than almost a halloween thing . 
  right now , in the usa , for example , there are over [ ** 100 active neo-nazi groups ** ] ( http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/ideology/neo-nazi/active_hate_groups ) .
