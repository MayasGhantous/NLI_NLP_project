  support them . 
  we have those kind of ` peacekeepers ' in our country , yet nothing is done about them . 
  i do n't want to argue , i really had no idea who were to blame ... 
  wow , i should have read the article . 
  you gave me a surprise there ... 
  sorry for being ignorant , which country ? 
  well , the solidarity they felt towards the last government was not because of respect , but because they did their bidding . 
  syriza is a much more competent party , with people trying their best for greece . 
  if they stopped doing that they would also be punished . 
  this whole situation seems lose-lose for everyone . 
  the debts do n't go away but nobody will be inclined to pay them in our generation . 
  on the other hand , there is the problem that if greece defaults , investors lose ** all ** of their money and the eu integrity will be broken . 
  at least with the haircut , there is still a chance of partial payoff . 
  now , you may ask , what the haircut would accomplish ? 
  debt creates requirment of more loans that in turn , genetate more debt . 
  it 's an infinite circle . 
  lowering the debt means lowering the pressure on the government and the market can eventually return to its normal flow , thus starting to repay the loans . 
  nobody really cares what you think, 
  another box checked , misinterpritation to suit your needs . 
  a ) i love ukraine , since i was actually born there . 
  b ) i hate this government . 
  democratically elected governments do n't come after your last president was overthrown and ran for his life . 
  c ) putin is a nasty motherfucker who invaded a country to promote his own needs . 
  d ) putin is not for blame for all the evils in the world , neither ukraine 's government is . 
  ukraine 's government is the reason for all the evils in ukraine . 
  the epitome of brainwashed individuals and as i said just two comments before :  who said anything about putin ? 
  i 've said that the dnr could not possibly shoot the city they occupy . 
  it 's brainwashed people that spin it to propaganda , putinbots etc. 
  and you even go on to call me a putinbot . 
  thank you for reaffirming me . 
  i do n't care about putin or what he does to russia . 
  i care more about ukraine and what their current government does to them . 
  and spinning it that putin is destroying ukraine is just retarded . 
  putin is just taking the opportunity presented to him . 
  it 's the idiots that orchestrated the coup that are harming ukraine . 
  nope , the other side exists and would probably say the same things about you . 
  there 's also another side ( more like the in the middle ) who thinks that both other sides are talking bullshit . 
  browsing through your history i find it hard to believe anything you say since your posts only consist of bashing russia . 
  that 's why i asked for proof . 
  also , define reliable journalism . 
  i 'm pretty sure the other side also reads reliable journalists who have different things to say than your reliable journalists . 
  you know that civil wars are a possibility . 
  like ukrainians fighting ukrainians ? 
  most of the times people with interest help one side or the other . 
  like the west helped the junta come to power in the greek civil war . 
  that does n't mean that i can say that truman occupied greece . 
  proof ? 
  who said anything about putin ? 
  i 've said that the dnr could not possibly shoot the city they occupy . 
  it 's brainwashed people that spin it to propaganda , putinbots etc. 
  did hitler have a house and family in athens ? 
  i honestly did n't know that . 
  inb4 dnr shelling their own city . 
  like / u/arathian explained , it depends on the situation . 
  my grandpa was also buried in a a village cemetery , but he remained there for 10 years . 
  he lived most of his days in the city , but wanted to be buried near his family . 
  some smaller villages just ca n't cope with that . 
  their cemeteries were build long ago , when 30-40 graves would not be full for decades . 
  so , if they attack them now , can russians say that us fired at their troops ? 
  this is / r/europe . 
  happens every time . 
  well the talks for now revolve around not cutting them any further . 
  that is one of the main lines of the negotiation . 
  syriza has said many things that they can not afford to do , at least for now . 
  outdated data obviously . 
  [ here is the 2013 report ] ( http://www.oecd.org/greece/oecd-pensionsataglance-2013-highlights-greece.pdf ) . 
  mind you , further cuts were imposed in 2014 . 
  all points have a ** `` technical details for this calculation are available from gspr '' ** so unless you know what these calculations are you ca n't say that they do n't have access to data . 
  well , i do n't see anything laughable here . 
  some proposals seem to be on shaky ground but at least the reasons behind them are well explained . 
  i find statements like `` cut pensions '' or `` cut wages '' much more laughable . 
  and if they did n't roll their eyes they could see that `` austerity '' and `` cut x '' tactics did n't work in the past . 
  but of course they ca n't be bothered to hear someone who talks sense . 
  typical python scripter , unoriginal and penniless ... 
  if alexander the great had left a will maybe greece would be the wealthiest country today . 
  history takes no guesses ... 
  i am frequenting since 2013 . 
  the quality is still the same old shit . 
  soviet tyrant stalin is the one who won wwii . 
  so i guess he should be . 
  who knows what would happen if he was n't in charge . 
  just ukraine going back to the 90s . 
  they went through the same shit as russians did . 
  still waiting ? 
  so where does it say that soviets killed more estonians than the nazis ? 
   especially when most of those died in the war were killed by the soviet union . 
  source ? 
  that 's / r/europe for you, 
  that 's why we are hopeful about the new government . 
  it was untold for the previous economic ministers to come out and discuss issues like that . 
  at least these guys have a vision , whether it comes to fruition in the end is another issue . 
  greeks , ukrainians and russians are all orthodox . 
  am i the only one seeing a paradox here ? 
  so nato is using article 5 to force europe get involved and europe keeps nato because of russia . 
  and yugoslavian wars have everything to do with it . 
  nato invaded and divided a balkanic country , and it was closer to us than ukraine . 
  i 'm sorry that you get your jimmies rustled and look for conspiracies that do n't exist . 
  nato existed as a `` deterant '' against soviet union and exists after its fall . 
  if you think it is anything other than usa power projection and control on eu , you are mistaken . 
  firstly , generalizing a is a little hard , since a consists of many parts .
