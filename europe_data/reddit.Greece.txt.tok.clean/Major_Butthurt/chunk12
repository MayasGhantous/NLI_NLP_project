  blackmail ? 
  how is it blackmail when everyone wins ? 
  by giving incentives for me to pay my taxes , i repay the government , the government repays the debt holders and the debt holders repay you . 
  that would actually be european solidarity but obviously it does n't exist even for you . 
  again , my obligations is to pay the government my taxes . 
  i 'm doing that . 
  i have n't walked away from my obligations . 
  now , when i 'm paying my taxes , while eu slashes my profits and asks me to pay more , it creates an incentive to stop paying because i will have a loss . 
  and as you say , if i do n't pay taxes and default , this will also create a problem for you , who own greece 's debt . 
  so , maybe it is in your best interest to force eu make incentives for us to repay our debt and not the oppossite ? 
   given the greek attitude , it 's clear that the eurozone should 've instead propped up the bank balance sheets , let greece default , exit the eu and force them to fix their state on their own . 
  this is exactly what should have happened . 
  we would live poor by ourselves , now we live poor while being told that you pity us and that we are beggars . 
  i have n't owed anything to anyone in my life , and you telling me that i owe you is insulting . 
   european tax payers you think you have paid a single dime for greece ? 
  nope . 
  it 's a bank to creditor transactions , you did n't pay anything . 
  the european taxpayers is a line pushed by your parties to hold ground . 
  also , how is it solidarity when you create more debt ? 
  the whole wall of text i wrote , not even once i blamed you for being poor . 
  i 'm blaming eu for not doing something substantial to correct it . 
  i 'm blaming eu for letting this happen under their noses . 
  we dug ourselves in this shit while eu was watching and we do whatever it takes to get dug out . 
  but the strategies eu is proposing are ridiculous . 
  one simple example , you do n't need to be an economist to answer it , just use logic . 
  you have a problem , you do n't have enough revenue from taxes , citizens are not paying them . 
  what is your solution ? 
  ** logical solution : ** give them incentives to pay . 
  divide their debt and let them pay little by little . 
  erase part of their debt if they repay part of it now . 
  ** eu solution ** increase taxes , lower their income , increase the price of basic goods . 
  as i said , you do n't need to be an economist to understand that this logic is flawed . 
  you do n't buy this shit , but you buy the whole `` european solidarity '' line ? 
  is it european solidarity when you have years of austerity and no actual results ? 
  is it european solidarity when you push the same strategies on our throats even though they have created a humanitarian crisis ? 
  what really unites greece and estonia , or estonia with germany , germany and greece ? 
  we are a union only by name . 
  different economies , different cultures , everything is different . 
  a fiscal union would be a step towards unity , but as we know it will never happen . 
  also , why should your grudges hold any meaning to us ? 
  your agricultural exports to russia where meaningless , while greece farmers suffered this year because of the embargos . 
  our national telecom is owned 40.0 % by deutsche telekom , our railways were sold to different groups , our ports and airports are owned by the chinese . 
  is it european solidarity when a country is sold to the highest bidder , but not if the bidder is not on your pre-approved list ? 
  let those questions sink in a little . 
  you have n't walked in our shoes once , why should we walk in yours . 
  whatever feelings you have against russia , solve them yourselves . 
  we do n't have the privilage to carry your grudges and idealism . 
  it is dirty money only by your standards , which we do n't have any reason to share . 
  if russia will bring investments and money into greece , i will welcome them . 
  you can think whatever you want , call us whatever you want , but european solidarity does n't pay our debts . 
  are you talking about the debt or the `` cooked books '' ? 
  because national debt is something you can look up on the internet while `` cooked books '' are impossible to make without having people from the eu commission assisting you in `` cooking '' them . 
  excempt from [ conditions for membership ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/policy/conditions-membership/index_en.htm ) :  throughout the negotiations , the commission monitors the candidate 's progress in applying eu legislation and meeting its other commitments , including any benchmark requirements . 
   this gives the candidate additional guidance as it assumes the responsibilities of membership , as well as an assurance to current members that the candidate is meeting the conditions for joining . 
   the commission also keeps the eu council and european parliament informed throughout the process , through regular reports , strategy papers and clarifications on conditions for further progress . 
  also , no country ( except germany ) fully met the requirements stated . 
  shhh , we are lazy beggar-eu traitors and therefore must act as such ... 
  from wikipedia about the [ greek civil war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_civil_war#post-war_division_and_reconciliation )  in 1989 , the coalition government between nea dimokratia and the coalition of left and progress ( synaspismos ) -- in which the kke was for a period the major force -- suggested a law that was passed unanimously by the greek parliament , formally recognizing the 1946 -- 1949 war as a civil war and not merely as a communist insurgency ( '' \u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 '' ) ( \u039d . 
  [ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] under the terms of this law , the war of 1946 -- 1949 was recognized as a greek civil war between the national army and the democratic army of greece , for the first time in greek postwar history . 
  under the aforementioned law , the term `` communist bandits '' ( \u039a\u03bf\u03bc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 , \u039a\u03a3 ) , wherever it had occurred in greek law , was replaced by the term `` fighters of the dse '' . 
  basically , in the earlier years he would be tried as an insurgent and executed . 
  after the fall of the junta he would be tried and imprisoned as a deserter . 
  also , he already settled in ussr , had a family and worked as an enigneer in zaz . 
  there was no point leaving . 
  my salary comes exclusively in 200 euro notes , thank you very much . 
  because my grandpa was a political refugee from greece and could only return after the fall of the soviet union, 
  you obviously have no more arguments . 
  good comparison ... 
   everything he wants what did he do exactly ? 
  i actually am . 
  i was born in the ukrainian ssr and moved with my family when it all went to shit . 
  i still have relatives in ukraine . 
  and yet i still ca n't understand . 
  i mean last , as the one before that one . 
  the legality of the current president , i wo n't delve into . 
   when asked why he defected from russia to join a ukrainian national guard regiment , the 22-year-old muscovite simply replied : `` common sense . '' proceeds to join a regiment recreated by a government who overthrew their last legal president . 
   asked earlier what he was fighting for in ukraine , andrey succinctly replied : `` justice . '' responding to a follow-on question , he added : `` for ukraine . '' so how is it justice to fight and kill his own brothers who , by his words , where forced to go and fight in ukraine ? 
  and how does fighting for ukraine help to better the political situation in russia ? 
  that guy is either made up , or does n't have a brain . 
  i do n't know what 's worse . 
  ehm , where is that quote in the video interview ? 
  i have n't found it anywhere . 
  communism would work if the state was self-sufficient . 
  unfortunately , as this doens n't happen anywhere in the world . 
  every state is influenced by external politics and economics . 
  for example the fall of the soviet union can mostly be attributed to reagan 's politics and oil prices fluctuation . 
  if it was n't for them , the soviet union may have survived or turned into a chinese-type government . 
  if you read marx or engels , you will understand that soviet russia was n't communist either . 
  not by their standards at least . 
  yes , i agree we must have a proper taxation system . 
  all i 'm saying is that we , the honest taxpayers , can not police the others to do so . 
  what we could do , is elect a new government and wish for the best . 
  the previous ones did n't even try . 
  indeed , my mistake . 
  well , your generalisations do n't help anyone either . 
  you compare some rotten apples with the rest of us . 
  and yes , you vastly overestimate the amount of tax-evaders . 
  most of us pay our taxes like you do , we can not police others in doing the same . 
  i also wonder , do you have any clues as to why ? 
  yeap , at least 26 % of the population .
