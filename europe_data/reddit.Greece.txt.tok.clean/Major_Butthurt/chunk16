   the first two point would be irrelevant in such a short term even in normal situation . 
  you really must do more research in economics . 
  everything is relevant . 
  investment banks . 
  that 's what goldman sachs is . 
  you drop the price of governmental services and then buy them for peanuts . 
  greek railroad company trainose was sold last month for 45million . 
  yeap , that 's right , the only company providing railway passage to a whole country was sold for less than messi 's thigh . 
  demonstrations must be organized and funded . 
  you ca n't just take 1 million people ( let alone 44 ) and tell them to leave their jobs and travel hundreds of miles just to demonstrate . 
  also , you 've got a much larger demonstration , and it actually encompasses two regions , donbass and luhansk . 
  well , thank democracy , when 1 million people * out of 45 can overthrow a government and install their own . 
  as a greek , i appreciate democracy . 
  coups are not democratic . 
  * 1 million is the official number given by the new government . 
  it was actually much less than that , since the area ca n't accomondate this number of people . 
  good ? 
  but attributing them as the main cause to something , while there where events equally game-changing is laughable . 
  in ukraine - 2014 : * a coup government was installed * the ukraine -- european union association agreement was signed * the war ind donbass started yet ukraine 's economic downfall is attributed 100 % to `` russian aggression '' while nobody talks about the other events . 
  unless i see some numbers , it will still be blatant russia blaming . 
  it 's obvious who 's the baby here . 
  good luck with your life . 
  ok , i 'll play this game . 
  do n't you know that the ** installation of a coup government ** * deprived ukraine of the significant industrial export-oriented region ; * broke the important business relationships with rf ; * scared the foreign investors ; * put on the budget the heavy burden of social protection of civil refugees and wounded soldiers ? 
  if you do n't know that , there is no ** sense ** to talk to you until you get educated . 
  if you know that and * ignore * that for the sake of the argument , there is no ** sense ** to talk to you at all . 
  you see how easy it is to attribute all this to what ** you ** think is the cause . 
  i let the numbers talk , and i still have n't seen any . 
  i 've read that and then wrote that comment . 
  there are no numbers , just words . 
  ukraine 's militrary expandature in 2016 was [ 5 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armed_forces_of_ukraine ) gdp according to wikipedia , but ukraine 's gdp per capita fell way more than that . 
  so , i want to see actual numbers correlating to the war , not something that was just written . 
  still , citation needed . 
  there were no numbers directly linked to the conflict . 
  just a prediction and then the actual shrinkage . 
  nowhere do they correlate the war with economic downfall . 
  so it 's really the same like in the other comment . 
  just blame it on the russians . 
   mainly due to the russian aggression citation needed, 
  guys , it 's just a coincidence that barroso pushed for austerity measures in europe , bringing some countries ( and his own ) down a slippery slope . 
  there is nothing to see here . 
  i did n't know greek were many languages ... 
  this sounds like a 90 ' anti-narcotics ad . 
  i 'm greek and we also can be drafted here . 
  i ca n't imagine how it is , just doing your duty and die for nothing . 
  as i understand , many of the casualties were young kids who did n't know they were participating in a coup . 
  fuck the people who got them involved . 
  just take it on faith , like you do with other anti-russian news . 
  wait , what do you want ? 
  proof , maybe ? 
  honestly , everything said is just theoretical . 
  when the crises hit , forget about eu solidarity . 
  it 's every man ( country ) for himself . 
  this is not the right mindset to go forward as a union . 
  except when they demand the sacrifice of your first child . 
  totally uncool . 
  i see only one guy wearing a shirt with cyrillic and i see him getting hit with a bottle to the head . 
  who threw that bottle ? 
  probably russians too ... 
  ehm ... how exactly do we know they 're russians ? 
  also , just because they were n't filmed does n't mean such occurrences does n't exist . 
  turks living in cyprus , yes . 
  it 's a minority . 
  they are called turkish cypriots to separate them from turks living in mainland turkey . 
  as there is no other thing to differentiate them from , rather by the place they live , they are called turkish cypriots . 
  that dose n't mean they are cypriots . 
  they are still turks . 
  they are a different nation from cypriots . 
  what 's so hard to understand ? 
   turkish so , not turkish cypriots ? 
  cypriots are the lawful citizens of cyprus . 
  the turks living there moved after an invasion in 74 , to witch europe and nato turned a blind eye . 
  so the turks living there are not cypriots . 
   cypriot turks are cypriots what ? 
  that 's exactly the opposite of what i said . 
  cypriots are christians and speak cypriot greek . 
  turks are muslims and speak turkish . 
  cypriot turks are muslim and speak a turkish-derived languaged . 
  aka they are turks . 
  fundamental difference . 
  this civil war does n't have to do with language . 
  russian-speaking ukrainians from dnipro , who are the majority , are with the kievan side . 
  the war is topographical , since the rebelling provinces had the power to oppose the coup government , with the help of russia , of course . 
  this however does n't mean that this is a ukrainian - russian war . 
  because if you assume that , someone else could say this is a nato - russian war , which is false . 
  cypriot turks are just turks , nothing difficult here . 
  it 's still war . 
  greeks - turks = war ukrainians - ukrainians = civil war ca n't make it any easier , sorry . 
  i react how i would in any civil war, 
  if you do n't want soldiers get killed , do n't send them to active fight zones . 
  or better yet , do n't organize coups . 
  greece does prosper , do n't you read imf 's reports ? 
  not only we were the main benefactors of western civilization , but the term `` europe '' is also greek . 
  so yes . 
  if anyone has a say in european prosperity it should be the greeks . 
  great , we politicized a competition that was supposed to be celebrating europe 's prosperity through music . 
  shame on us . 
  but is it sanctioned by the un or not ? 
   second , your unhealthy obsession with the us is showing . 
  yeah , because trusting governments who go to war with false pretenses is the right thing to do ...
