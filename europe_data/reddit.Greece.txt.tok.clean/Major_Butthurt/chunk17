  first , if we ca n't trust the un , then we definitely ca n't trust the us . 
  second , there was n't ** any ** investigation for the recent attack , so pointing fingers is n't helping . 
  so , wait , you 're saying that the un human rights report is biased ? 
  because they wrote the ` bore the same hallmark ' propaganda bullshit . 
  what alternate facts ? 
  the one does n't contradict the other . 
  turning in chemical weapons was not a confession of guild , they just did it to assure the western allies it wo n't happen again . 
  which is actually another interesting point . 
  the whole operation was supervised by the un . 
  so did they miss the chemicals used in the current attack ? 
  they did n't endorse it , they supported it after it happened . 
  that made me feel that we 'll get another 2013 row of unverified counter-strikes . 
  fortunately , this wo n't be the case as it seems . 
  so , the sanctions were proposed as punishment for the syrian gas attack , except there 's still no proof who did it . 
  same thing happened with the 2013 attack . 
  the [ un human rights council report ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ghouta_chemical_attack#un_human_rights_council_report ) stated that the attack bore the `` same unique hallmarks '' as the sarin used in the [ khan al-assal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khan_al-assal_chemical_attack ) attack , which was used ** against ** assad 's forces . 
  it 's quite nice that most european leaders do n't jump to conclusions without an official investigation . 
  he rarely is . 
  but for the one time he is n't , people will bash you for thinking he is . 
  by the same standards i can hate the germans because they killed my great-grandfathers , but i do n't . 
  the simple turkish people did nothing wrong . 
  you should hate their governments not the citizens . 
  do n't get me wrong though , i understand your notion , but / r/place is supposed to be above politics . 
  try posting to / r/greeceplace maybe ? 
  they will help you . 
  this is how `` revenge politics '' work and i see it becoming a regular phenomenon in the eu . 
  basically it revolves around the idea of hurting the `` opponent '' as much as possible , without considering how much you 'll hurt yourself . 
  for brexit being a good or bad move is debatable , but we should still keep good relations with the uk as we can both benefit . 
   ( migration , ukraine , greece ) are , really , relatively minor and easily manageable with eu 's enormous resources . 
  the greek problem may be minor from a point of view , but it is definitely not manageable in it 's current state . 
  8 years without a solid solution is not called `` manageable '' . 
   a clear audience voting result ehm , the audience actually gave more votes to russia . 
  it was the juries that gave ukraine the winning points . 
  also , from a musical standpoint , jamala 's song is not bad , but worse , it 's forgettable . 
  i can remember most tunes clearly , having heard them only once , but i can not for the life of me remember one chord in jamala 's song . 
  there is actually a [ guardian article ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jan/21/suicide-gender-men-women-mental-health-nick-clegg ) about it . 
  still , there are so many different methods . 
  maybe i can combine two or three , but that would leave me unsatisfied ... 
  would n't work . 
  they can not easily grasp the concept and i can not show it more than once . 
  the real problem is , as opposed to men , women ca n't fucking get the job done . 
  neither does the march maidan coup , but it is what it is, 
  yeah , problem is , we have yet to find a realist to vote for . 
   a realist or a populist which one is which ? 
  asking for a friend ... 
  not only they are ugly , they also have inferior infrastructure . 
  these building were mass-built during the khrushchev era , to cover an incoming housing crisis . 
  let 's say the materials were not the best . 
  * edit : seems that i repeat what is already stated in the article ... 
  metaxas would like to join the axis , but only as a subject of nazi germany , not italy . 
  so when mussolini decided he wanted a noteworthy conquest for himself , targeting greece , metaxas no other choice as to oppose him . 
  and after that hitler has no other choice as to assist his current ally and save them from embarrassment . 
  if nazi forces invaded first , we would be on the other side of history . 
  luckily , they did n't . 
  i think it will be easier to start mass protests and when they eventually turn violent , stage a coup and overthrow lukashenko . 
  as you said , it will probably go down the same way as ukraine , except russia will be on the other side . 
  it will be so funny when lukashenko , previously called the last dictator of europe , will be celebrated as a hero of freedom when he leaves the eeu . 
  still more work than the bellingcat article . 
  [ here , i created a map with my point ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zyi6a40.jpg ), 
  remember , this is bellingcat . 
  they proved russians shot down mh17 by finding some dots on a map and claiming these was buks, 
  that says something about the people who voted for him, 
  now we only need a fiscal union ... 
  people believe , that just because you do n't have much buying power , you 're starving . 
  it 's obviously not the case with ukraine . 
  it 's not an argument , it 's a statement . 
  a closing one . 
  trying to justify the unjustifiable . 
  because denial always made things better . 
  let 's talk in a year . 
  we 'll see who 's right or wrong . 
  [ economy ] ( http://www.focus-economics.com/countries/ukraine ) and [ corruption ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2016/10/14/how-corruption-corrodes-ukraines-economy/#55cdaae067cf ) are the main statistics . 
  security ? 
  you have a civil war raging in the east , that 's pretty much the opposite of security . 
  foreign relations ? 
  with whom ? 
  relations with russia are obviously fucked , and the west used you as a political victory , then left you on your own as it was expected . 
  so now you are in a worse position overall , on all factors , as i said in my original comment . 
  there are no melodramatics here . 
  in the right direction . 
  the new government made everything worse . 
  it is true that greece has been though worse , but someone would argue we 're moving in the wrong direction . 
  for all our efforts and sacrifices the situation is steadily getting worse , with no solution in sight . 
  and just before anyone quotes our politicians talking about positive primary surplus , it does n't mean much . 
  our fiscal surplus and growth are still in the negatives , with the second being the most obvious identifier that the current plan is n't working . 
  why bother arguing with the truth ? 
  [ citation added ] ( http://europe.newsweek.com/gallup-ukraine-411868?rm=eu ) , but it 's not only that , i have relatives living in ukraine . 
  [ for corruption ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corruption_in_ukraine#corruption_perceptions_index_ratings ) yes , blame third parties for dividing your country , but blame all of them . 
   the idea at the time was that minister of interior had to go after students were beaten up to a pulp for no good reason on 30th nov. . that 's what roughly a million people gathered to protest against the next day . 
  was that hard to comply with ? 
  a minister would resign over an incident like this in any democratic country . 
  hell , even prime ministers resigned over less . 
  they doubled down instead . 
  laughable . 
  this is how disrupting mass protests are cleared in all countries . 
  greece , usa , france , turkey . 
  everywhere is the same . 
  but what is special about 30th november ? 
  you did n't have that coup till mid february next year . 
  what were you doing in-between ?
