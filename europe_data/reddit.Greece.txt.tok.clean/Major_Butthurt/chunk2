  * being a police-state shall i continue ? 
  just simple intelligence would be enough, 
  that 's not how it works ... 
  what do you mean ? 
  that nazi germany could n't take poland without the `` help '' of the soviets ? 
  cause that really does n't make any sense . 
  so fp says it 's two agents of fsb and we take it as fact ? 
  really ? 
  that the whole maidan was staged by the west . 
  of course they do n't have to deny it , since none of the western media points it out and all russian media are considered propaganda . 
  honestly , i think greece should start a war with russia , maybe we get more help that way . 
  what you did was trying to overthrow a government , and you did . 
  then , nobody went to talk with the rebels , you sent armies . 
  so they asked for help . 
  also , by the exact same example you set about greece . 
  imagine bulgaria being divided into west and east . 
  east votes for party a , west for b. 
  party a wins the majority , but the capital is in west territory . 
  so the west overthrow government a and establish b. 
  would n't the east be annoyed by that ? 
  what 's more , it has happened once already ( orange revolution ) . 
  what are the guarantees it wo n't happen again ? 
  there is , it 's just one side gets upvoted and other downvoted just on bias , not on actual facts . 
  you obviously mind , since you bothered answering to me . 
  and now you took a high moral ground . 
  no , i would prefer both voices to be heard, 
  as does the other side . 
  nobody 's a saint in this conflict , except some people try to show it this way . 
  of course russia is helping . 
  as you got help from the west to organize your maidan . 
  the point is , not all rebels are russians , as not all maidaners were ukrainian . 
  saying that they should be crashed , just because russia was involved is retarded . 
  best bots are free bots . 
  there are people that are convinced they still did the right thing , overthrowing a government . 
  that 's great !, 
  so you are convinced about something and because i 'm not , you think i 'm somehow inferior and my opinion matters less ? 
  yeah , sorry ** mate ** , at least i have critical thinking and do n't just eat up everything that 's thrown at me from the media . 
  indeed it would . 
  however , by now , every voice of the opposite side has been driven out and alienated . 
  if you support russia or east ukraine you get downvoted to oblivion . 
  except , do it on purpose and blame the rebels ? 
  i like how people are accused of putinbotting , but nobody is accused of parashenkobotting . 
  of course , this is a biased sub , so i would n't expect things to get better . 
  nah , i found the sentiment of you not choosing the first image nice . 
  makes me feel special . 
  ooh , you chose the second one from google images . 
  i indeed like it more than the first one , thanks . 
  everything pointing does n't mean anything . 
  that 's why criminology exist . 
  they do n't just convict anyone who 's the likeliest suspect . 
  / r/ukraineconflict ? 
  did you mean / r/ukrainianconflict ? 
  the sub modded by no other than / u/bipolarbear0 ? 
  give me a brake . 
  wait , so you calling the rebels being all russian military is first hand knowledge or not ? 
  or ukrainian edit : to everyone downvoting me . 
  would you be so kindly to provide evidence as to why the ukrainian army is not to be considered suspect ? 
  this is what you get when you get all friendly with the us . 
  good luck to us all , i guess . 
  it is unemployment ? 
  absolutely no context , just some soldiers carrying rugs . 
  or extracting a person from a car . 
  this film is just reverse propaganda . 
  russian sheeple and the like . 
  wait , was n't russia going to collapse a year ago ? 
  are we gon na see an influx of these kind of posts again ? 
  so we must take it on your word that you are telling the truth ? 
  everything you said is purely anecdotal . 
  there are definitely people among the rebels who are not getting paid . 
  just because you were doing it for free does n't mean anything . 
  the same could be said about the participants of euromaidan . 
   i 'd love seeing the rebels crushed why ? 
  because they want a to choose a government and not get one imposed on them ? 
  you know that predictions are based on assumptions ? 
  this is a prediction . 
  [ imf is known to be wrong about things ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2tuferv.jpg ) . 
  setting up the tribunal is not the hard part . 
  getting the accused to face the tribunal is . 
  it will still take some months/years anyway , i do n't see why would they rush it now , unless someone has to gain something . 
  no , that 's exactly what i 'm saying . 
  why start a tribunal now , when the investigation is still unconcluded ? 
  whatever the investigation yields can help the tribunal pinpoint the culprit . 
  there 's no reason to rush a tribunal now , unless interests are involved . 
  innocent until proven otherwise ? 
  except the un wants to stage a tribunal ** before ** the official investigation was concluded . 
  that 's a little suspicious . 
  could n't they wait until fall ? 
  unless the investigation was concluded and they do n't want to tell us who did it . 
  which would also be suspicious . 
  edit : sorry , forgot about the circlejerk . 
  really ? 
  you want to give nukes to a coup government ? 
  just wish they do n't aim them at you then . 
  you can have no strong feelings one way or the other . 
  a ) good , we now reached an unpresidented level of retardity here , using memes . 
  b ) everything i said is true . 
  you forgot the '' / s '', 
  ukraine 's spotlight was when they staged a coup . 
  ukraine 's problems right now : - economy going down the spiral - humanitarian crisis - corrupt politicians - war putting them in the spotlight now would mean the coup was a failure . 
  who in the right mind would do that ?
