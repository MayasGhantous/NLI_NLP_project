  nothing . 
  nobody would understand . 
  every payment is done through credit cards or online . 
  but our banks are so backwater they can not implement that simple system . 
  even ukraine 's privat bank has a better system than any other greek card . 
  athens would n't have closed the banks if idiots like him did n't rush to withdraw money from last friday . 
  and this guy will probably vote yes in the referendum . 
  the system is broken , but i have no sympathy for him . 
   investing = = economics let me put it to you this way . 
  you can invest if you have money . 
  you ca n't do economics unless you have knowledge . 
  economy is a science . 
  he 's not an economist . 
   furthermore , he never even accused greeks of being lazy . 
  he accused them of wanting an easy life with no work ... something everyone wants . 
  the difference is your government granted it to you . 
  no , that was the basis of his `` cultural system disintegration '' argument which , by his words led to the current stituation . 
  it means that everyone wanted but the greeks did it . 
   the difference is your government granted it to you . 
  i think you mean `` selected few '' . 
  most people worked and payed their taxes honestly . 
   now that gravy train ended , and there are a significant number of greeks who want to go back to the way it was . 
  it wo n't happen . 
  i do n't want to go back , and most greeks do n't . 
  we just want to have jobs that can pay for our taxes/expenditures . 
  with unemployment at 25 % , plus 0 workers rights , plus skyrocketing utilites prices and new taxes , this is not dignified living . 
  also , greeks being lazy is not true , so he is at least misinformed . 
  him being misinformed tends to create uninformed opinions . 
  this is just an opinion and a quite uninformed one . 
  esspecially this bit :  but if your whole cultural system disintegrates , say the way it did in greece where everybody wants an easy living with no work and a lot make believe and fraud and what have you , then the keynesian stuff wo n't work . 
  i wo n't even comment on the lazy greeks part , but germany and japan had their economies rebuilt by the usa after wwii . 
  if greece had the same industry efficency as those countries , we would n't be in this mess . 
  mind you this is not efficency per worker but efficency per hour of work to the current industrial situation . 
   also if the policies worked for spain worked for italy why should n't it also have worked for greece ? 
  different situations ? 
  comparing countries like that has no meaning . 
   also if you have a deficit of 15 % gdp you have to cut back from that this is simply mandatory . 
  this sentence shows exactly what 's wrong with people who do n't know about economics . 
  cutting things is not a way to increase gdp and [ in fact it does the opposite ] ( http://7d77c24d03a62043cfe4-5f6ff8e305d6142e830d07da1bf3d404.r76.cf1.rackcdn.com/1353006479_0.png ) . 
   i think it is stupid to expectgreece to have a balanced household , but i think getting down to a reasonable level of new debt ( 2-5 % max ) is mandatorxy in my opinion . 
  i think it wouild have been possible to get greece out of this together but i think this gets more and more unrealistic the only think that 's unrealistic is expecting greece to repay an unsustainable debt . 
  with more cuts you can expect the economy to stagnate in the next ten years and greece will be in a much worse position then . 
  only option is positive reforms and debt restructuring . 
  all other options lead to a greek demise . 
  it is about politics . 
  it was from day one . 
  a basic economic principle that everyone can logically deduce : if you want to make more from taxes , you do n't lower wages and pensions while at the same time rising said taxes . 
  it is already proven that this kind of reforms do n't work . 
  and more of the same just does n't cut it . 
  i can not posibly believe that eu economists are so ignorant to not understand that . 
  so it leaves us with three options , in my opinion , all of them political : a ) this is a social experiment to how countries would react in this situation . 
  b ) eu politicians do not want to show some modesty and agree that they were wrong . 
  c ) there are interests at play here . 
  a ) it 's not that bad , far better than be lied about . 
  b ) they still have to deal with the rest of eu , which conists mostly of conservatives . 
  there is n't much you can do . 
  did n't you hear ? 
  we 're lazy bums , who reddit all day . 
  and again we have a retard . 
  it 's clear as day that you have no actual understanding of what 's happening around you and you repeat the same things your shitty media tells you . 
  two points , and i wo n't bother with you anymore : 1 ) lying about its finances - in modern economy , this is impossible . 
  you can hide a a couple of billions , not 300 . 
  the whole eu knew about the debt and kept us giving while knowing we ca n't sustain it . 
  2 ) do you know what loan means ? 
  you have n't paid ** a single fucking euro ** from your pocket and in fact ** i am paying you ** through interest on loans . 
   you are nothing without europe . 
  without the eu you would be moldavia . 
  based on what ? 
  or did that uninformed opinion came from a smart frenchman 's ass ? 
  i 'm not answering your question because the premise is fucking retarded . 
  most people pay taxes , it 's that your retarded media tell otherwise . 
  but when you are ** oblidged to pay more while getting paid less ** that 's degrading . 
  and it would n't be as degrading if the austerity measures ** fucking worked ** . 
  did you get your exact answer , because i ca n't get it more plain without patronizing . 
  you did n't understand my notion , the cutting wages and pensions while having to pay a shitton of new taxes , which do not extist in other countries . 
  i do n't even understand why you get so butthurt . 
  how much is the minimum wage you have in your country ? 
  is it more than 684 euro ? 
  do ** you ** think you are better than us ? 
  or if it 's less , you think the other countries are better than you , but not greeks . 
  ** receiving our money ** , every time i hear that , it all makes perfect sense . 
  let me make it explicitly clear for you : ** you currently paid me and/or any greek citzen 0 euros from your pocket ** . 
  if you think you did , you clearly do n't understand how economics work . 
  your logic is retarded . 
  so shut the fuck up or educate yourself . 
  do n't regurgitate the same things you hear from your retarded media . 
  i can tell you why . 
  because the same deal has already been accepted before , thrice . 
  our pensions has been cut , our wages has been cut , and we have to pay more , while earning less . 
  the 67 year limit has already been accepted , it 's just rising gradualy until 2019 . 
  paying differen vats is a way to unburden some industries so they can stay competitive or help the common people . 
  13 % on hotels helps greek tourism stay competitive , maybe not so much , but it would be worse at 23 % . 
  6 % on pharmaceuticals helps older people buy them . 
  having to pay 200 euros for pills on a 400 euro pension is retarded . 
  you 've got it all wrong . 
  tsipras was given a mandate to strike a non-degrading deal within the eu . 
  since he could n't do that , and calling for elections now would be even more catastrophic , he set a referendum . 
  so , as i 've said , you 're wrong , mostly because the initial assumptions you made are wrong , not the way you are thinking . 
  you 're not my supervisor, 
  i meant reapers from mass effect , as opposed to reavers .
