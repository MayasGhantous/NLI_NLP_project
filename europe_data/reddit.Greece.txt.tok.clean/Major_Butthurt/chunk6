  but i 'm indeed a fan of firefly too , so you got that right , 
  but , but tomorrow we can postpone it for another day ... 
  true . 
  except when people grab their pitchforks , it 's too hard to let go . 
  well the fpo is lying . 
  i do n't have a yacht . 
  i do n't need it when i can fill a pool with fresh 500 euro bills that europe gave us . 
  i avoid news , facebook and negative people these days . 
  i 'm generaly calm and collected but the idiocy is astounding . 
  do n't worry though , this will blow over . 
  and to think i saved their asses ... 
  yeah , reapers are a real threat . 
  it 's just that the council does n't want to believe me . 
  maybe . 
  maybe earth gets hit by a meteorite or we get invaded by reapers . 
  worrying about it now is meaningless . 
  i 'm even too lazy to finish writing thi, 
  there are three groups that constitute the current government now : 1 ) syriza moderate left 2 ) syriza exteme left ( aka left platform ) 3 ) anel ( independent greek party ) the first group has the most representatives and would vote for the agreement . 
  the second has less representatives , but given the political enviroment would still mostly vote yes , except maybe 3-5 people . 
  the third group only has 13 representatives , some of them would vote no , but most woul vote yes . 
  in the greater scheme the last group would not make any difference . 
  new democracy , potami , pasok would vote for with only the communist party voting no . 
  you see , the opposition will ** gladly ** vote yes , because then they could take the moral high ground and say : see , we told you you 'll agree to austerity eventually . 
  as fucked up as it is , this would happen and the agreement would make it . 
  syriza could n't pass the agreement on their own anyway , they only have 149 out of 300 seats , not constituting a clear majority . 
  eh , we always were like that . 
  it 's extremists of different groups that make us look bad . 
  plus , the foreign media that blow everything out of proportion . 
   but , also realised that there was no way to get it through parliament on his own , meaning he would have to deal with the opposition and that would in turn lead to new elections , etc. 
  you 're quite wrong here . 
  if the current agreement reached the parliament it would have been voted for . 
  people here expect that we actualy riot or something , burning everything and publicly executing our government on the syntagma square . 
  what we actualy do is go to work , laugh about the people that surge atms and go on with our lives . 
  gon na hit the beach after work , so why worry ? 
  because tourism , greece 's main `` industry '' , needs to stay competitive with other tourist destinations . 
  if i was a foreigner for example , i would prefer turkey too greece for my vacations . 
  almost everything is the same , except 5 times cheaper . 
  it hurt business that make more than 500,000 euros and want to shift the weight on lower incomes . 
  so it 's either we lose , or get destroyed . 
  that 's it for me . 
  i 've had it with this country . 
  politicans have no balls to stand up to eu and nobody can change my opinion now . 
  if they want to alienate greek youth , they 've done it . 
  i wo n't invest my future in greece . 
  i think he was being sarcastic ... 
  you mean from a philosophical or literal standpoint ? 
  for the first , is because there 's a european solidarity in which every member is equal . 
  now because this does n't happen , i 'll pass to the literal side . 
  if you took a look 10 years ago , when greece was full in europe , those three countries were considered sub-par to say at least . 
  mind you not only those three , i just brought an example for greek people to relate . 
  bulgaria for example was a destination to buy cheap clothing , drink and eat your hearts fill , gamble etc. 
  even some people from macedonia were driving there to buy fuel and then crossed the borders again back to greece . 
  now , the same people are looking down at you , and i 'm not saying they are wrong . 
  it 's an indicator of how much we , as greeks , have fallen and that there is n't a country hated more in eu right now . 
  we are probably on par with the russians . 
   instead they went crazy . 
  refused any sane help with restructuring the government bureaucracy , not fix the tax system in any way just blindly undoing previous reforms , calling the germans nazi 's , talking to putin threatening to undo the sanctions , threatening to open the gates for migrants , threatening to blow up the euro zone . 
  where do you get this bullshit ? 
  first thing they did once got elected was signing an agreement binding them to keep going with the current programm . 
  this was 5 months ago . 
  can you realistically think that a system as big as a counrty can change in 5 months ? 
  you are dellusional , sorry i have to break that for you . 
  the current talks are happening exactly because eu + imf does n't want greece to try their proposed program . 
  the only restructuring program they know is austerity . 
  and i repeat the same thing over and over . 
  it should be written in every single economics book in bold red . 
  ** austerity does n't bring growth ** . 
  it 's quite the opposite . 
  this has nothing to do with putin , nazis or migrants . 
  everything around this matter is political , not economical . 
  and what estonians think , i do n't fucking care . 
  the `` and you are still demanding they pay for you '' is what finaly gave away your retardity , clear as day . 
  you know nothing about economics , you know nothing about politics . 
  you 're just a retard and unfortunately you can vote . 
  i 've seen you before on / r/europe and / r/greece and i 'm really curious about your motivation and background . 
  you are always shitting on the current government saying how useless they are and present the time before syriza as a socialistic utopia . 
  i can only presume you are a 60 year all who made lots money through working on the government sector and was now fired because of corruption or something . 
  or maybe you do n't live here ? 
  maybe you are paid to write this stuff ? 
  because i ca n't realistically imagine a 20-30 year old who came out of university , thinking that sucking the world 's dick just to get the next dose for the rest of his life , is a viable option . 
  look around you . 
  everyone already hates us . 
  germans say they pay us and consider us a 3rd world country . 
  you even have polaks , bulgarians and estonians looking down at us . 
  and at the end of the day if i had to decide between the wellfare or image of my nation i would go for the former , every time . 
  varoufakis already said it : if there 's gon na be a solution it will only come on a political level . 
  the technical branches already failed to agree . 
   their mandate was to defend social security and the poorest within the realms of possiblity you can not generalize their mandate as such . 
  after 7 years of austerity with no improvement in the economy , 15 more years are not acceptable . 
  people do n't want them to defend their social security . 
  it is already in ruins . 
  people want their social security back , and that ca n't happen through austerity . 
   not to uphold a corrupt system of clientelism in a show of national chauvinism well , they actualy try not to . 
  still have n't seen them accused of that . 
   dragging up ancient conspiracy theories i do n't even know what those theories are  cozying up with motherfucking putin . 
  what do you mean cozying with motherfucking putin , and what does it even have to do with all that ? 
  did europe stop dealing with russia ? 
  did germany close the nord stream ? 
  we were actually the only ones not cozying with russia in europe . 
  but this is all not important .
