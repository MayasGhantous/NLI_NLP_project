  the only thing i can take from your comment is this :  but the fundamental problem in greek solvency is overly generous public benefits , a weak economy , and deficient tax collection . 
  first , that was the problem . 
  public benefits are now abysmal and are close to the eu standard . 
  second , a weak economy and tax collection are not mended by lowering wages and increasing taxation . 
  in fact , this is the basic you learn if you pursue a career in economy . 
  so this creates two options . 
  either the economists proposing more austerity are incompetent ** or ** the whole matter is completely political . 
  and because it 's the second , that 's what syriza was elected to do . 
  withstand the political pressure from eu , and if that ca n't happen , just fuck 'em . 
  to expand on the bullshit part . 
  / u/tortulho does n't know what he 's talking about . 
   triggering economic chaos debatable  to pardon greece 's debt not part of the talks . 
  it was a notion , not something to discuss . 
   the troika is receptive to the requests made by syriza 's government , but they request syriza 's government to actually implement reforms that mend greece 's problems and help them ween out of loan dependency and further debt woes . 
  some of the requests proposed by the troika was establishing primary surplus targets ( i.e. , the state spending being less than the state revenue , except debt payments ) , letting syriza 's government pick what 's the best way to get to it . 
  playing with 0,8 % or 1 % primary surplus is retarded and they just do it to keep the negotiation going and not showing that they `` gave ground '' to the greek government . 
  problem is , they do n't want greece to reach that goal with the proposals they are making . 
  you can actually find those proposals if you can use google . 
   here 's where the proverbial shit hits the fan : syriza 's government refuses to not only agree with basic reforms but also refuses to present any alternative plans to reach those targets . 
  they simply demand cash in hand for them to spend at will , thus making it impossible to actually get a deal . 
  major bullshit . 
  bigger taxation , wage and pension cuts are not basic reforms . 
  considering they ** did n't fucking work ** . 
  this is the main point of syriza . 
  they wo n't continue with the same old shit that even imf itself said were wrong . 
  just think back before 2008 . 
  before the south-ossetian war . 
  have you thought that russia would turn like this in 7 years ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  if you remember , medvedev , although considered putin 's puppet , was hailed by the west as a step towards a democratic russia . 
  then comes the 2008 war , the ukrainian crisis , and now most on this sub would swear that russia will invade a nato country in the coming years . 
  my point is , geopolitics is a fluid thing . 
  predicting the future makes no sense . 
  this has been said many times already . 
  austerity is not a reform . 
  it 's just a punishment for `` unruly countries '' . 
  it 's not like the debt appeared in one day . 
  for years it was amassing and the imf , ecb etc. 
  did nothing to stop it . 
  on the contrary , they were giving out more loans . 
  if the eu wanted to show it 's `` solidarity '' it would have bought out part of the imf debt and restructured it so greece would not have to deal with 3 sides now . 
  the metaphor was not used as an argument but serves to explain the absurdity of the whole matter . 
  you ca n't force someone to pay more while taking from him . 
  every economist knows that , and even a first grader would understand the concept . 
  which brings me to my point again . 
  this is just politics . 
  there is no european solidarity . 
  nobody would care if greek citizens would starve . 
  and to anyone calling this governement a failure , this is exactly what was expected . 
  why was it expected ? 
  because this is the only government that fought the austerity economics . 
  greek citizens have faith in the current government . 
  otherwise , after the imf payment was skiped everyone would rush to the local bank and withdraw their deposits in panic . 
  and to give a fair warning to other european countries . 
  if you told any greek citizen in 2007 what would happen in 2008 , nobody would believe you . 
  just hope that you wo n't be in the same position in the near future . 
  unfortunately / r/europe is inhabited by many trolls and people with conformation bias . 
  of course russia wo n't attack a nato member , but fear-mongering and russia-bashing is the way to go in this sub . 
  we love you too !!, 
  he 's jelly because they have 20c mid-summer while we go bathing in may . 
  well , at least they will voyage the stars togther now ... 
  can you read ? 
  because if you can , i do n't need to answer that question . 
  same reports every two months for the past two years ? 
  yeah , i stand by my statement . 
  g7 meeting coming soon . 
  fear-mongering will run rampart again . 
  ok , i wo n't delve to whether the referendums were legit or not . 
  point is , in crimea most people want to be part of russia . 
  most of them were even born in russia , and i mean not only the soviet russia , but crimea was part of the russian ssr before krushev gave it to ukraine . 
  were the citizens asked then if they want to be part of ukraine ? 
  also , when they wanted independence after the collapse , ukraine shout them down . 
  so yes , if i was crimean , i would probalbly prefer russia too . 
  as for the other parts , i do n't really know , but most of them would like to be considered russian too . 
  now for the best part . 
   they have no right to break a country they do n't like . 
  if they do n't want to live there , just move !, 
  you know who broke the country ? 
  the maidaners . 
  they overthrew a legitimate government . 
  a government that most of the lugansk and donets voted for . 
  so the seperatists did n't brake the country , they wanted to be part of a country who they elected , not one that can be overthrown on a whim . 
  and they want to live there . 
  they lived there their whole lifes and they have families there . 
  fuck if anyone forced me to move just because someone staged a coup in the capital . 
  nobody asked those people if they wanted to get rid of the last government , why should they ask the new government for independence ? 
  great write-up , i can clearly understand now what your `` winning the negotiation '' argument was , and from my point of view it is valid . 
  also about people voting , i see it being discussed on greek tv lately , we 'll se how it plays out though . 
  and the right course it waiting for it to happen while waging a war that ruins your economy . 
  so for 3 states , who do n't want to be part of you anyway , you fuck your whole country . 
  sound political decision right there . 
  what are you comlaining about . 
  it 's not like you gave us money for free . 
  if we default then you can talk about sinkholes . 
  and honestly , we should have done this a long time ago so we do n't have to hear your whining . 
   wait , what ? 
  so if your country is invaded , you would n't react because military is ` useless ' and instead would support your citizens by ... raising wages or what ? 
  so all that wealth could be grabbed by the invaders ? 
  whose invading where exactly ? 
  like right now , what are of the ukraine is being invaded ?
