does n't rule # 1 kinda defeat the purpose ? 
   i am just annoyed you and we ( greeks ) both , and on top of that , getting downvoted because of flairs , of simply being greeks , called lazy leeches , made fun of . 
  the point i 'm trying to make , simply do n't reply , and it will die down . 
  this kind of logic is retarded . 
  * do n't do unto others ... *, 
  i misread , apologies . 
  but really , c'mon , heated replies from both sides do nothing but further the negative situation that already exists atm . 
  and neither does gdp per hour worked . 
  listen , i get your frustration , i really do . 
  just avoid replying , 
  yeah , my bad , posted it there . 
  possible new measures in the greek proposal . 
  article is in greek , but the google translate function works moderately well . 
  this is a news agency that i 've grown to trust the last few weeks , but please take this with a grain of salt , as from what i can tell , it 's not official . 
  on the why he did it ? 
  absolutely . 
  the thing is that it 's almost apparent now that the reason there 's no solution is political . 
  which is what syriza has been saying all along , with eu denying it vehemently . 
  unrelated , got jealous , i 'll admit . 
  well , in retrospect , sure . 
  but many a thing can be said in retrospect . 
  the point is , you people ( you being a generalization here , an expression ) jump at syriza 's throats when it 's the previous government that should 've done all those reforms promised as far back as 2008 . 
  but , as someone else said , water under the bridge . 
  playing the blame game does n't lead to anything constructive at the moment . 
  see below . 
  my point is , the reason all those ultimatums existed : greece needed either a package or else default , they could n't do anything before that got taken care of . 
  as such , there could n't have possibly been any reforms before that , could there ? 
  as tsipras put it , they spent the 5 months mostly negotiating and not governing . 
  because it was necessary . 
  you do understand that reforms can not happen without , well , essentially , money ? 
  basically what they did is push greece to the wall , so they have no option . 
  well , coming out at this point with such an opinion is the equivalent of dropping a bomb , especially after his stance was `` we are waiting for greece 's proposals '' the last days . 
  so , scauble on restructuring : https://twitter.com/systematic_fx/status/619146494721961985  germany 's schaeuble says debt sustainability is not feasible without a haircut , think the imf is correct in saying that https://twitter.com/fxmacro/status/619143825316048896  - germany 's schaeuble says can not be a haircut because it would infringe system of european union also : https://twitter.com/dailyfxteam/status/619143878898262016  germany fm schaeuble : imf told him not to be too lax toward greece ; merkel wanted imf in on greece from the start . 
  yeah https://twitter.com/spiegelpeter/status/619145768876802048/photo/1 but he did n't seem to be pushing this opinion until now . 
  also , relevant : https://twitter.com/dailyfxteam/status/619143878898262016 not sure how credible , anyone ? 
  bahaha , greek drama ? 
  more like greek comedy :d, 
   it makes me doubt the story as a greek , yeah . 
  dunno , though . 
  maybe they were asked for proof ? 
  it 's a legal swamp , no one seems certain . 
  this does n't make a lot of sense . 
  they did n't promise anything other than trying to achieve a better position for the greeks . 
  `` trying '' being a key word . 
  but there were multiple quotes from the institutions that restructure/relief/haircut / whateveryouwanttocallit is completely out of the question . 
  i can dig links , but it 'll take a while . 
  nah , they 're evil , `` commie '' , corrupt , lazy greeks simply trying to leech more money . 
  the imf did a 180 \u00b0 , and , apparently , now tusk . 
  of course it 's justified , at least to the greeks . 
  but the eu rhetoric is strong . 
  the government was officially formed on the 26th of january . 
  so no they did n't have `` even more time before that '' . 
  also , blaming only one side for the failure of negotiations is naive to say the least . 
  the way i see it , that 's exactly why they got declined , 
  in that case , the above statement is completely false as there have been a number of proposals before and after the announcement of the referendum . 
  in the packages the imf proposed ? 
  the ones that got declined ? 
  i 'm not speaking about the general past , but the packages that got declined leading up to the referendum . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3cko3i/why_is_tsipras_attacked_as_not_bringing_to_the/cswfe6i pretty much sums up my feelings as well . 
  yep , the main problem with past deals was that there was no form of debt restructuring , which essentially is simply kicking the can a bit further while not actually offering any solutions . 
  the whole of july . 
  it 's the 9th of july . 
  hmmm . 
  unless it 's sarcasm , in which case , my sarcasm meter is borked on this sub , sorry . 
  edit : [ also this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3cko3i/why_is_tsipras_attacked_as_not_bringing_to_the/cswfe6i ), 
  well ... fuck the police !, 
  literally :p that brunette is too cute . 
   lol , no , i do n't care whether greece joins russia and retake byzantium . 
  you 're onto us !, 
   ashamed if i were a greek today nope . 
  fair enough . 
  traitor !, 
  it 's reverse psychology , i 'm a karmawhore deep down inside . 
  i said , i 'm generalizing . 
  but , politically , what did the yes vote mean ? 
  come on , even karamanlis returned to the political foreground to take advantage of it . 
  my post was not about making angels out of the no people . 
  but , again , politically , the yes movement represented all that is wrong with greece . 
  they are supported by one of the biggest media moguls . 
  i think that speaks volumes . 
  there is fear , of course . 
  but the choice really was between getting slowly drowned or jumping off a cliff as someone else put it . 
  either i 'm too exposed to those people or lagarde is indeed leaning on the gilf side . 
  i mean ... oh forget it . 
   does he speak greek with an english accent ? 
  slightly . 
   if so , would n't it have presented political problem for tsipras to appoint him as finance minister ? 
  not that i know of . 
  replying in a new comment just so you see it , if you really want to see what the greeks who voted no feel like ( again , anecdotes , but there 's no way to quantify this without essentially making a documentary :p ) and especially the younger people , i 'm going to quote the last paragraph of one of my recent posts :  i 'd rather have to queue for foodstamp lines than ever see them in power again * . 
  they are corrupt , treacherous and brought us to this point . 
  enough with the old corrupted system . 
  this is what the no vote meant , politically , and to think otherwise is delusional . 
  * the parties supporting the yes vote , new democracy , former pasok members and potami . 
  in reply to a fellow greek , supporter of the yes movement . 
  i live in a well off place ( northern suburbs of athens ) . 
  my house is the only house in the block that has a legal attic . 
  you have to declare it to the irs equivalent , so it gets taxed as living space . 
  the rest of the people , through loopholes , have n't . 
  the very same people are supporters of the yes movement . 
  i am the `` lazy '' `` tax evading '' greek because of them .
