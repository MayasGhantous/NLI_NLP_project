asking the right questions about iceland . 
  serbia is triggered as fuck rn . 
  you misunderstood me . 
  i 'm not saying that religion was the * cause * of the conflict , or its ferocity . 
  just that the misery brought upon the common people by the war was enough to drive many into religious fanaticism . 
  due to them thinking that god was the only thing that could save them from that mad world . 
  something similar happened during the height of the black death . 
  i was more referring to the peasants and the lower classes . 
  not the primary agitators . 
  those rarely went to war for purely religious reasons . 
  it 's like westeros irl . 
  no wonder so many people thought it was the end of times and turned to religious fanaticism . 
  really dark era . 
  forever jelly about portugal . __ . 
  at least they are not called fucking ** broke ** . 
  can any german or german-speaking redditor confirm that this is not a mistranslation ? 
  i 'm having trouble thinking that a government would state something so egregious . 
  * edit * : thanks , everyone . 
  i figured it must have been editorialized . 
  it 's ok , jesus was a good socialist . 
  he even provided free top-notch healthcare for all . 
  well , if you look at his works and sayings , jesus fit the profile of a progressive hippie leader of a worker 's and peasant 's commune down to a t . in all seriousness though , \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u00f3\u0441\u044a \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0440\u00e9\u0441\u0435 !, 
  to all the orthodox redditors out there , 
  it does matter where the information comes from though . 
  if somebody presented me a link from a mother jones article or an organic food firm citing a dozen studies that `` prove '' the harmful effects of gmos , i 'd question whether they are cherry-picked , inaccurate , twisted or flat-out fabricated . 
  so when an agricorp with a stake in genetic engineering and a gmo pundit blog are quoted , i 'll ask the same question . 
  turkey shooting down that russian jet was n't an overreaction . 
  what their turkmen pets did to the pilot was . 
  which i 'm not sure you can hold turkey 100 % responsible for . 
  i do n't really have a dog in this fight ( gmos are n't widespread were i live ) but did you just really link the genetic literacy project and the * monsanto website * as a reliable sources on a discussion about gmos ? 
  look , i support that you 're trying to fight misinformation and debunk conspiracy theories , but wtf did you just link ... 
  we and germany are never , * never * gon na live those down , are n't we ? 
  no , they are not . 
  once upon a time in the cold war , yes . 
  but now the soviet union is no more and russia does not pose a threat significant enough for the us to establish `` buffers '' between their allies and its territory . 
  all the nations that want to join the eu/nato do so on their own free will , and because they seek economic growth , greater political influence and the betterment of the lives of their citizens . 
  the exceptions are poland and the baltics , who feel threatened by russian irredentism for valid and historical reasons . 
  * russia * , on the other hand , feels insecure enough that it needs to set up frozen conflicts and frail satellite states around its borders , even at the expense of other nations ' self-determination . 
  and rightfully so . 
  this ai n't the 60s and nations in europe should n't be bullied into becoming buffers just because russia , or anyone else , feels insecure . 
  instanbul is actually quite liberal in this regard . 
  at least from what i 've experienced . 
  iirc most people ( at least online ) accuse corbyn himself of pandering to anti-semites . 
  not labour as a whole . 
  well , it hits the 2 % mark , but it 's mostly a defense-based , limited range military . 
  greece does n't really need anything more . 
  that 's why i think the 2 % requirement is kind of dumb . 
  each country has different geopolitics and security concers , and its military spending should reflect those . 
  spending money is n't a bad thing . 
  it 's when you do n't spend them productively that there 's a problem . 
  that 's greece 's issue . 
  fortunately or unfortunately , with turkey nearby , military spending is a necessary evil . 
  so those money are n't wasted . 
  we do our part , back off obama . 
  these guys are like a rl south park gag . 
  oh , i know . 
  i was more referring to its reputation of being expensive . 
  it 's gon na be * yuuuge * . 
  or should i say ... #m . e.g.a. 
  you just solved the refugee problem . 
  i take it you are not a big fan of the city ? 
  europe at it again with the overseas colonies 'n shit . 
  jesus , ca n't that man stop complaining ? 
  the * extra 3 * parody song has nearly 10,000,000 views * precisely * because he would n't shut up about it . 
  erdogan needs to learn to let things go . 
  seriously , he 's just digging himself a little deeper every time he does n't . 
  kinda sad that the european left has gone down the toilet like this . 
  see , while i do n't condone riots , they put people 's lives at risk , this might be a necessary shake-up . 
  i mean , i know a lot about political apathy . 
  i get why the population of a country which is troubled by terror attacks & refugee waves might end up adopting a cynical , passive stance when it comes to politics . 
  but this might be the straw that finally breaks the camel 's back . 
  the thing which will manage to pull the voter base out of apathy . 
  you 've got religious fundamentalists trying to override the very principles their country was founded on . 
  that 's not something you can simply acheive without turning everyone but your most fanatical supporters against you , imo . 
  this is the same party whose leader wants to start peace talks with isis , yes ? 
  is n't the majority of turks still in favour of secularism ? 
  i think even the akp will have trouble pulling this off . 
  yogurt ? 
  that 's whataboutism . 
  the trail of tears and its horrific nature are taught in us schools today . 
  japan ( which is not christian , btw ) has apologized many times for the atrocities it commited in china and * still * gets called out on them to this very day . 
  [ britain has also apologized for the potato famine ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/blair-issues-apology-for-irish-potato-famine-1253790.html ) . 
  even belgium is slowly [ coming to terms with its colonial past ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/belgium-revisits-the-scene-of-its-colonial-shame-2014055.html ) . 
  also , keep in mind that 1 ) none of the above were * systematic * extremination campaigns like the ones commited against the armenians , the assyrians and the pontians . 
  2 ) only belgium 's and japan 's crimes surpass the ottoman empire 's in sheer scale . 
  so do n't pull the religion card on this and do n't try to act like you 're being discriminated against . 
  it 's generally pretty sad how much of a bad rep sikhs get all over the world . 
  nationalists hate them because of the way they dress , fundamentalist christians hate them due to mistaking them for muslims and islamists hate them because ... well , they are islamists . 
  and the irony is that they tend to be amongst the more seclusive and law-abiding people around . 
  just pls do n't send me her nudes . 
  oh , fuck off already . 
  yes but , why release those statistics ? 
  are you people some kind of nazis or something ? 
  this is some * escape from new york * type of shit . 
  #pack it in boys !, 
  our [ lynxes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balkan_lynx ) ate them all . 
  tayyip is a * mess * . 
  for what 's worth , i think the whole `` happiest/least happy nation '' statistics that occasionally float around are silly , too . 
  if you knew what perception meant you would n't link to the 2015 corruption perceptions index as some sort of reliable source on spain 's corruption . 
  it only lists how corrupt is each country * seen as * by a certain number of people .
