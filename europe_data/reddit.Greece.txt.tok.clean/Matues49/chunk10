  yeah , a random opinion piece by a retired politician that is , in no way or form , representative of an entire ethno-religious group , or even an elite subset of them , as you are insinuating . 
  tell your friends over at r/the _ donald to scrap up better talking points next time . 
  well , if you knew anything about demographics you 'd heard about a thing called ` demographic transition ' and learn not to worry about such fear-mongering . 
  and you 're basing that on ... ? 
  source that there 's some sort of ` kalergi plan ' in the work ? 
  or any of this , really :  in order for the eu to federalize it needs to destroy european national identity , this is the reason for the allowance of mass migration into the eu . 
  same thing , really . 
  that 's just a random opinion piece . 
  dog whistle harder . 
  if this winds up being true ( it currently says ` alleged ' ) , then they should eject their asses . 
  what if you call a sex hotline ? 
  i mean , it 's all in the name . 
  rude . 
  malmo is n't the epicenter of an ongoing armed conflict against terrorists that has claimed 4.000 + lives , m8 . 
  ` arab spring ' was more like a very deadly summer heatwave . 
  i mean , i get it . 
  amazing history , lovely climate , some pretty great beaches and , yeah , it 's cheap but ... cheap enough to risk getting torn apart by crazy exploding jihadists or angry mobs ? 
  not to mention the crime rate . 
  29 may 1453 worst day of my life ; _ ;, 
  it 's even more impressive when you consider how massive the umayyad caliphate used to be , in terms size , resources and population . 
  talk about placing all your bets on one number and losing big . 
  i mean , even if this stabbing did n't happen , why would you go to egypt for holidays this period ? 
  they literally have an armed insurgency going on at sinai . 
  not trying to victim blame but , c'mon ... 
  it 's like poland is getting angrier and angrier each passing decade . 
  i do n't really think it 's dumb , but i did n't upvote 'cause independent . 
  why , yes . 
  my country of origin makes me something of an expert in all sorts of myths . 
  from fair maidens getting ravished by olympian gods in animal forms , to peculiar orthodox hermits having ` divine revelations ' in mt athos , to the mystic and forbidden practice of tax returns . 
  500 $ bills are like the unicorns of paper money . 
  unique looking & majestic but only exist as myths and rumors , never to be seen by mere mortal men . 
   disproves what ? 
  `` fatal terrorist attacks have become increasingly deadly in recent decades '' . 
  that 's my point . 
  nobody cares that it was worse in the 70 's . 
  it 's rising again and it 's unacceptable . 
  except the point is * they have n't been rising at all * . 
  they are lower than ever . 
  we just hear about them more . 
  you 're equating your feelings of fear with reality . 
   only one community transforms from unemployed to suicide bomber and isis member . 
  spain has 25 % unemployment . 
  eastern european youth are poorer than much of the people in these areas . 
  where are their suicide bombers ? 
  you 're right . 
  you wo n't see them becoming suicide bombers . 
  you 'll see them turn into human traffickers , drug dealers , arms smugglers , pimps , robbers ... 
  poverty and misery take many forms . 
  one of them is extremism , another is rising crime levels . 
   that 's my point . 
  it 's sizable . 
  yeah , sizeable . 
  but no more sizeable than the equivalent christian one , which has been aroumd here much longer than radical islam . 
  neither ever managed to pull a hostile takeover and turn europe into a theocracy , despite their supposed numbers . 
   and by the way disproving of homosexuality is not the same as wanting them in prison , of course they do n't want them in prison , they just kick them out of their homes , openly insult them in public , deny them equal rights such as marriage and , at worst , beat them up a little to ` set them straight ' . 
  and i do n't need to remind you that it has n't been muslim conservative politicians who have been going out of their way to make life difficult for lgbt people in east & southeastern europe , even today . 
   nothing you wrote disputes my point . 
  damn right . 
  but that 's because you do n't really * have * a point to dispute . 
  just hysterics about something being ` seriously wrong with europe ' without really having any facts to back it up , a couple cherry-picked links you did n't even bother to read properly before you posted and some vague right-wing rhetoric regarding migration & terrorism . 
  why , is n't he the cheekiest war criminal this side of the atlantic, 
   https://fee.org/articles/by-the-numbers-europes-terror-problem/ not even going to address this , you own link disproves you . 
  it literally closes with this :  the upshot of this is that europe is actually getting safer , but -- because deadlier attacks are more widely reported , and therefore easier to remember -- it will feel like it 's getting more dangerous . 
  so , no . 
  feels do n't equal reels . 
   `` an estimated 470 to 553 foreign fighters in syria have roots in belgium , the greatest number per capita of any country in the west . 
  many of those young jihadists have ties in brussels and to molenbeek or schaerbeek . 
  the mayor of molenbeek herself has called it `` a breeding ground for violence . '' two ghettos in brussels being shitholes = / = '' * somethingseriously wrong on our continent * '' . 
  it even says on the article you linked that the true underlying factors for this situation * in those specific areas * are high youth unemployment rates & few educational oportunities . 
  e.g :  ** high unemployment in both neighborhoods contributes to isolation from the wealthier city center **  the youth unemployment rates in molenbeek and schaerbeek are among the highest in the city . 
  for people ages 15 to 29 , molenbeek has an unemployment rate of 27 percent . 
  schaerbeek has a youth unemployment rate of 22 percent , while the brussels region averages 19 percent . 
   ** there are fewer educational opportunities for young people in these boroughs **  many young belgian jihadists have less education than their peers and are mostly of moroccan heritage , according to analysis from the royal institute for international relations , or egmont . 
  the education disparity in brussels has roots in the socioeconomic disparity between natives and residents with immigrant backgrounds . 
  egmont found that a disproportionately large share of students with migration backgrounds in cities like brussels are placed in `` concentration schools , '' schools with a high percentage of disadvantaged students . 
   https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/11/british-muslims-strong-sense-of-belonging-poll-homosexuality-sharia-law your very own link shows that statistics prove the vast majority of uk muslims feel a very strong sense of belonging and want to intergrate integrate further . 
  do you even read what you post ? 
   the research suggests that 86 % of british muslims feel a strong sense of belonging in britain , which is higher than the national average of 83 % . 
  a large majority ( 91 % ) of the british muslims who took part in the survey said they felt a strong sense of belonging in their local area , which is higher than the national average of 76 % . 
  of those questioned , 88 % said britain was a good place for muslims to live in , and 78 % said they would like to integrate into british life on most things apart from islamic schooling and some laws . 
  yeah , a sizeable minority of 23 % sympathize with backards , retarded nonsense such as sharia and such . 
  but they are just that , a minority . 
  do they somehow wield more power or have a better chance at implementing their inane teachings on britain that , say , [ 30 % of christians ] ( http://www.brin.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/clements-figures-attitudes-to-homosexuality-01-2017-f9.png ) ? 
  there will always be backwards , reactionary people . 
  anything * else * you 'd like to be wrong about ? 
   something is going seriously seriously wrong on our continent and it needs to be fixed . 
  it 's like people have no idea how bloody things in europe were , in terms of terrorism , back in the 70s-80s . 
  the era europe is currently going through has been one of the most peaceful in its history * by far * . 
   trump is the most articulate bruh . 
   the rise of enclaves of europe populated by people that detest the very values yeah , that 's not a thing . 
  look up ` demographic transition ' . 
  it 's bound to happen to these ` enclaves ' too , sooner or later . 
   that make this continent - our home - exceptional . 
  oh , do n't start with this ` exceptionalism ' nonsense . 
  that 's the americans ' schtick . 
  that , too . 
  you 're wrong about the numbers , though . 
  i believe the biggest beneficiary of eu funds would be [ poland ] ( http://cdn3.spiegel.de/images/image-243792-thumbflex-xmfc-243792.jpg ),
