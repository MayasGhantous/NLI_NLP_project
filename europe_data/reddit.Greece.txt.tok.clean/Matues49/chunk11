   totalitarian arm of brussels lmao, 
  does this guy think that he 's somehow fighting islamic terror by copypasting the exact methods islamic terror uses ? 
  cretin . 
  ca n't have people badmouthing the sugar daddy $ $, 
  this is some 4chan-level `` propaganda '' the russians are using . 
  quite a step-down from pavlik morozov . 
  it 's more of a '' * when your life is falling apart but you do n't care * '' face . 
  what 's funny/sad is , these snap elections and the chaos that followed them has likely caused more damage to the uk position in the brexit talks than any of those `` saboteurs '' [ the daily mail was so eager to see crushed ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/c9ugpxbxgaaxn2e.jpg ) . 
  so , do you think this coalition will make it 'till winter or what ? 
  first cameron , now may . 
  what is it with recent tory leaders shooting themselves in the foot like this ? 
  h u s b a n d o u s b a n d o, 
  for a country of its size , india has a surprisingly small debt . 
  someone should fill his car with pork fat . 
  * ouch *, 
  get out with this us-centric nonsense . 
  this has nothing to do with race . 
  it 's alright , citizens . 
  the innocent have nothing to fear . 
  geopolitical reasons aside , last time things got left unchecked in the balkans , the situation got [ a bit out of hand ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yugoslav_wars ) . 
  not a good idea , when it comes to the balkans . 
  it seems that they are trying to pull another bataclan . 
  * le brave comment *, 
  i think a portion of the british press can be too self flagellating , at times . 
  the only ` laughing stock ' may is making here is of herself ( okay , and maybe her party because that last debate was lolz ) . 
  nations are n't their leaders . 
  hey , i mean , if you look at the rock 's career from its start 'till know , you ca n't deny that the man is quite smart & charismatic . 
  plus , with him as president , the us will get to join the recent trend of '' * countries electing unusually young & handsome leaders * '' . 
  for real though , it 's not like most of you voted for the guy . 
  and , looking at his approval ratings , it seems that most american 's hearts and minds are in the right place . 
  the us just had a collective mid-life crisis . 
  happens to the best of countries . 
  three years from now , the guy will be a bad memory . 
  spectacled guy on the far left looks jelly af . 
  tbh , such groups have been a plague ever since the late 60 's . 
  and these new anarchist ones are actually quite tame compared to [ what the state had to deal with in the past ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolutionary_organization_17_november ) . 
  trump is like the living embodiment of every old & tired offensive american stereotype on the internet . 
  yeah , i do n't normally care much about gmo stuff and whatnot , but linking *monsantoblog.com * in order to debunk accusations made againstt * monsanto * seems , well , not the best way to source an argument ... 
   they also did a pretty good job at subverting greek democracy during their referendum . 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  and yeah , even with volkswagen , the level of shady corporate lobbyism in europe pales in comparison to what happens in america , a country where legalised political bribing exists . 
   we got thousands in cash , you guys got a plastic pipe ( presumably to stick up yer butts ) and maybe a nice box/letter set . 
  are you feeling alright ? 
  do you have someone we should call ? 
   they are journalists that are often in political debates of this tv channel even worse , then . 
  well , sports presenters are n't exactly the cream of the crop when it comes to journalism . 
  is he having a mental breakdown or something ? 
  nothing of what he said made any sense . 
  years of minority rule , and the subsequent reaction ( s ) after its downfall , have left their mark on southern africa , i see . 
  and how tf can america be worse than an openly oligarchic nation like russia ? 
  come on ... 
  i mean , if movies have taught me anything is that 80 % of americans can afford those symmetrical suburban little houses with point-y rooftops , palladian windows , wooden entrance columns , nice white picket fences and a built-in garage . 
  it ca n't that bad . 
  nationalism in all its forms is pure shit . 
  shh , it 's ok . 
  those were greek patriots . 
  * patriotism * can be hijacked and turned into cancer , which is nationalism . 
  nationalism is cancer . 
  [ it gets better ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/69qyhd/macronleaks_rampant_illegal_drug_use_islam_for/ ), 
  if a pilot has a heart attack , his plane is falling down and the passengers get to pick who is going to fly it next , then they better chose the professionally trained co-pilot instead of the disarmingly persuasive passanger , who 's but an used-car salesman irl . 
  if someone thinks the later is better suited to pilot the plane and preserve their safety , then they are wrong . 
  and , quite possibly , a dumb-ass . 
  besides , i do n't think i , at any point , stopped someone from having an opinion . 
  nor am i in a position to . 
  if you wan na be wrong , be wrong . 
  yeah , but those people are wrong . 
  compared to macron , le pen is lacking in almost every aspect . 
  that 's a fact . 
  well , what you say is true but le pen is trash , so anyone openly supporting her probably deserves getting those downvotes . 
  this thread is particularly cancerous rn . 
  banks are good for u,

  she does , although it 's a red one . 
  i 'm pretty sure she got it from lidl . 
  when i was younger , my grandma also used to give me [ this stuff ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1jqjac6.jpg ) all the time . 
  i have no idea where she 'd buy them from , but she seemed to have an infinite supply . 
  they always start shit that quickly gets out of hand . 
  remember humpty dumpty from * puss in boots * ? 
  that 's him in the thumbnail , now . 
  feel old yet ? 
  hope they can . 
  no reason for this ` divorce ' to not be as painless as possible , for both parties . 
  ok , so what 's next ? 
  invade so we can secure those wmds , bring peace to ther region and establish democracy ? 
  give me a break . 
  if nato starts some foolishness again , i hope greece stays 100 % out of it like it did in 2003 . 
  guns . 
  poor serbia , out of all balkans countries , it always gets the raw-est of deals in world wars : / the always bounce back rather nicely , though . 
  'cause they identify with anything pussy-related . 
  why are you so angry ? 
  you have a point there , tbh . 
  m\u00e9lenchon is n't really communist . 
  in europe , at least , big urban centers are more likely to feel the negative effects of immigration than the working class countryside . 
   the average person voting for marine le pen is a blue-collar worker or unemployed man , with limited higher education , hailing from a rural town .
