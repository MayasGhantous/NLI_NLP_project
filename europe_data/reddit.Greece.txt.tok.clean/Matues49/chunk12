  no big shocker here . 
  factionalism is the eternal bane of the left . 
  sad but true . 
  u/spez just endorsed macron . 
  lepen is worse because she 's actually experienced . 
  drop out when it became clear he had no chances and not drag things up to the convention ? 
  come on ... 
  blah blah blah ... i swear , those far-right , '' anti-globalist '' preachers all regurgitate the same talking points . 
  some people are bitter they did n't get to bang their hot high school teacher , i guess . 
  eu is already as left as it needs to be . 
  definitely one of the most social-minded supernational organization in existance . 
  yeah , a lot of people seem to ignore/forget how absolutely brutal the ira and leftist terrorist groups in mainland europe where back in the day . 
  to be fair , you have those in america too . 
  it 's just that nearly all of them appear to be contained in just one party . 
  the macron momentum is hitting me harder than his wife hit on him when he was her student . 
  fillion just called for macron . 
  good for him . 
  we need more politicians who place country over party . 
  no one says thay must vote what we are just saying is that , by staying apathetic , their are putting the political future of their country at risk . 
  look what happened in america . 
  it 's the * bernie effect * . 
  cazeneuve is reportedly calling for voters to rally behind macron . 
  swear at me daddy . 
  hamon is very dignified . 
  i wish we had more graceful politicians like him here in greece ,, 
  # * ca n't con the macron *, 
   no matter if le pen wins the presidency ... ah , already moving the goalposts i see . 
  it 's nice that you have , at least , accepted that lepen has no chance of winning the presidency . 
  the brief , reactionary wave of alt-right extremism is already being smashed by the immovable rocks of globalism . 
  soon , you 'll all be dragged kicking & screaming into the 21st century , 
  let them eat chocolate cake . 
  burkhas are n't really trendy rn . 
  they 'll most likely wear hijab . 
  [ you right now . 
  ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/001/096/564/2f7.jpg ) keep it up . 
  lepen will lose harder than donnie moscow has been losing the last five months . 
  euronews has around 23 % for macron and 21 % for lepen . 
  impossible . 
  my muslim overlords will , most likely , completely ban advanced technology for us dhimmi by then . 
  windows is absolutely haram . 
  why , the sharia-powered emirs who will rules over europe are surely going to crack down on any dissent against allah 's word , will they not ? 
  that includes the `` rise of alt-right political parties '' . 
  ca n't have it both ways . 
  true , true . 
  ca n't forget what happened across the atlantic a few months ago . 
  i 'm confused , i thought europe would ` soon ' be a muslim majority hellhole under sharia law ? 
  so much fake news floating around the internet . 
  thank god for euronews . 
  right wingers are n't people man . 
  alt-righters btfo, 
  source ? 
  what tide ? 
  that 's french for you . 
  * ca n't con the macron *, 
  never stick your dick in crazy . 
  if * ast\u00e9rix en corse * taught me anything , is that corsicans always chase mainlanders off with stones and pitchforkss . 
  at least , when they bother to get up from their siesta . 
  i wonder how many those of french tags over at r/the _ donald harping about lepen and whatnot belong to actual frenchmen . 
  * ca n't con the macron *, 
  you just had to post this on the eve of french election ... 
  uber better learn to abide by the local laws & regulations of the countries it operates in , if they want to preserve their ` freedom ' . 
  harry turtledove written a lot of great ah books centered around rome/byzantium . 
  he also wrote a very bat-shit crazy one which had reptilian aliens invading earth in the midst of ww2 . 
  fun series . 
  chechnya is the closest thing we have to neo-feudalism in europe . 
  everything about it is a barbaric anachronism . 
  izmir and eastern thrace , you know what to do ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  i do n't get it . 
  you can get 10 + ( extreme case ) years for a robbery and be out at 5 , with good behaviour , if you just surrender to the police . 
  but actually shooting at them and killing a cop ? 
  how thick-as-pigshit can these crooks be ? 
  he 's probably a radicalized local like most before him . 
  * if * this was a terroristt attack . 
  probably a curse or plague of some sort . 
  [ here it is explained in 5 seconds .

  i wish i 'll be half as witty & energetic as dennis skinner when i 'm nearing 90 . 
  the man must 've run out of fucks to give during the john major-era . 
  am i drunk again or did you double post in one post ? 
  i still remember how he defied all expectations and came in like a wrecking ball during the republicans ' primary when he was expected to end up , like , third . 
  that was some pretty strong momentum . 
  kudos to french voters for being savvy enough and ditching him when he exhibited signs of crookery . 
  too many people fall into the trap of * my party , right or wrong * nowdays . 
  damn , fillon never managed to recover from penelopegate . 
  i knew i should n't expect more from huffpo . 
  the independent has gotten pretty bad with this , too . 
  for a country of its size & population , portugal sure made a juicy land-grab in its early colonial days . 
  'till he grows [ the appropriate beard ] ( https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xfa1/t51.2885-15/e15/10643914_791071977623556_40893192_n.jpg ) . 
  between sultan erdogan , the so-called islamic caliphate of iraq and levant and those crazy chechens up in caucasus calling themselves an 'em irate ' , the near east is looking , undeniably , a bit retro nowdays . 
  'cause he rigged the fuck outta it . 
  whatever the result , this was not the crushing victory erdogan could really use right now . 
  the major urban centers of the west have rejected him , as has the more educated , younger generation ( s ) . 
  he can pass all the laws he wants , but he 'll never be a ` sultan ' . 
  i doubt he 'll even manage to actually the level of authoritarian control putin has . 
  what a mean-spirited thing to say . 
  it would n't be so annoying if most of them were n't backwoods americans who 've never , in their lives , had a group of 10 + refugees within a mile radius from their town . 
  it 's like everyone 's an expert , suddenly . 
  it gets better , he actually asks for * putin * , of all people , to be the godfather . 
  god-tier trolling . 
  literally .
