  you do n't . 
  literally eating babies . 
  dude , seriously . 
  five people just died . 
  not saying anyting about your points , but do you * really * think this is the time and the place to bring up age old historical feuds ? 
  yeah , this weirds me out too . 
  this is n't some dumpster exploding or a molotov thrown at an empty store . 
  you 've got army bases getting firebombed and kamikazees blowing themselves up in the middle of the street . 
  you 'd think that large cities like ankara , istanbul and izmir would be dotted with police roadblocks and security checkpoints by now . 
  they do n't make light of it . 
  it 's dark humour born out of cynicism towards a ( sadly ) pan-european narrative which constantly tries to whitewash pkk of its crimes . 
  and this has been going on for years . 
  i do n't know if you recall , but people where actually * rioting * outside turkish and israeli embassies after \u00d6calan ( a well-known terrorist mastermind and mass murdered ) was captured . 
  and yeah , do n't be that guy . 
  the one who 's acting deliberately obtuse . 
  you knew full-well what he meant and why he said it . 
  was it the godamn tak again ? 
  it was clearly sarcasm aimed at those who keep trying to paint pkk and its offshoots as noble , progressive , secular freedom fighters , even in the wake of bloody , senseless attacks such as this . 
  do n't be that guy . 
  shit-tier moderation , that 's what happened . 
  what 's more worrying is that these attacks are happening not on some fringe kurdish/syria-bordering province , but on the capital of turkey itself . 
  putting a much larger number of innocent people in danger . 
  you 'd think that , after all the recent rise of hostilities , security would 've tightened a bit . 
  i 'd argue that , despite all its issues , eu is currently * better * off than the rest of the world . 
  especially compared to our `` neighborhood '' . 
  and are swimming in guns . 
  and are landlocked . 
  * and * have proven to be a pain for any would-be conqueror . 
  honestly , the similarities are more than you might think . 
  i 'd be too if i was turkish . 
  ankara cats are a fluffy delight . 
  but with less memes . 
  jesus , * again * you 're trolling here with your self-hating bs ? 
  greece ( along with spain and italy ) have been asking for european help in order to deal with the migrant crisis for * years * , only to get sent to the complaint box . 
  and the example you brought up , with tsipras , is not only inaccurate , but has absolutely ** nothing ** to do with the current situation . 
  it 's just more ammo for you to self flagellate . 
  so , yeah , greece actuallly was - * gasp !, 
  * - the wronged party in this dispute . 
  go atone for your country 's sins elsewhere . 
  that 's because they get so high , they reach heaven . 
  weed is the doorway to god . 
  not sure about the present but i can take a wild guess about the future ... 
  the strongest one !, 
  but you 'll be surprised at how many people can only be convinced by big numbers . 
  there are certain prejudices regarding all-things-turkish in europe that have n't died out yet . 
  well , all things considered , there are definitely enough turkish speakers in the eu to make a strong case for this . 
  not just in cyprus , but in germany , france and the balkans too . 
  curious to know what the conservative part of the turkish society has to say about this . 
  here in greece we 've got religious dinguses freaking out at the merest hint of it . 
  i thought corbyn was considered the commie of the bunch !, 
  * le mighty greek armie * to the rescue !, 
  is this going to become a morbid common occurrence * \u00e0 la * us mass shootings ? 
  i was going to respond , originally , but then i looked at your history and realised you 're just another bitter , self-hating greek who glorifies all things foreign and spents most of his time trolling anything greek-related with such drivel in order to come off as `` self-aware '' and score some pity points . 
  a sad product of the crisis , your kind is . 
  anyway , only thing i 'm gon na say is that if you want to discuss goodwill and collective repsonsibility , why do n't you go to the hordes currently blocking the highway to debate it with them ? 
  see how that turns out for you . 
  i was n't even born at the time you dopey cunt . 
  well , islands are public-owned . 
  do they count ? 
  hoses . 
  rubber bullets . 
  tear gas . 
  it 's time the police begins using those . 
  this is not the the first time we had packs of greedy , entitled people , who clearly could n't care less about local laws & authorities , coming into this country illegally , * refusing * to be registered or accommodated and running amok on the streets while causing havoc , movement disruption and property damage . 
  all of this just to get a shot at free welfare benefits in countries which are equally overstrained from the amount of `` asylum seekers '' they get . 
  now , i 've been patient for five years . 
  i 've been saying that we should sympathise , greeks have a long history of being refugees themselves , after all , i 've even been willing to pay a few extra taxes so we can finally build some proper migrant camps , and people no longer have to live in squalor at crumbling shanty towns . 
  but enough is enough . 
  these people have proven to be utterly self-centered and unwilling to deal with us in goodwill . 
  it 's time to start using stronger deterrents . 
  it can get worse . 
  we do n't get our shit together now , and we might be seeing jordan/lebanon-levels of mass immigration the next few years . 
  nah , some of them were foreign delegates from belgium . 
  there 's a reason for that . 
  farmers have been pampered with agricultural subsidies for years . 
  and , sadly , many of them are eu-funded . 
  i do n't even know how some people can maintain the '' * desperate , downtrodden refugees !, 
  * '' rhetoric in the face of such rampant asylum shopping . 
  it really pisses me off . 
  yeah , how many refugees is luxembourg expected to accommodate again ? 
  excluding foreign ceos looking for a tax haven , of course . 
  at the moment , what you say is true . 
  in the near future ... * we 'll see * . 
  i do n't trust tsipras not to fuck this up . 
  remember than fighting has recently intensified in syria . 
  we might see a bigger migrant wave . 
  whoever wrote that title , had an opportunity , and they took it . 
  damn , dude . 
  i realise now why so many people were desperate to cross the wall when gdr fell . 
  the thirst was real . 
  nonmedical use of antibiotics in the animal industry needs to die already . 
  if the aninal ai n't sick , do n't treat it . 
  now , the eu has taken some pretty big steps to combat this but more work needs to be done . 
  we did n't avoid potential nuclear annihilation for 40 + years just so we can die from antibiotic resistant bacteria . 
  [ the greek retirement age is also 67 ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/retirement-age-men ) , and likely to be even higher by the time i get to that age . 
  also , the article you linked is from 2014 . 
  quite a few ( [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/akis_tsochatzopoulos ) , [ 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vasilis_papageorgopoulos ) , [ 3 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dimitris_tsovolas ) ) so tell me , how many of those german executives that were involved in southern european scandals are in jail by now ? 
  okay but , the article mentions christians from iran . 
  what are christians from iran doing in * northern france * ?
