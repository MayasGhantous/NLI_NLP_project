  why are serbia and turkey so low ? 
   `` a mandate to work in third countries : the agency will have a new mandate to send liaison officers to and launch joint operations with neighbouring third countries , including operating on their territory . '', 
  this is the main obstacle here . 
  for decades , greco-turkish policies regarding the aegean have , more or less , weekly breaching of eachother 's air space and national waters . 
  it 's not widely known , but the two came very close to war [ about 20 years ago ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imia/kardak#military_crisis due to this very dispute . 
  you ca n't expect the greek parliament or the greek public to accept joint patrols with turkey or having turkish boats on segment of the aegean sea that are considered `` rightfully greek '' . 
  not with the historical animosity between greece and turkey ( even if it 's wind down lately ) and not with erdogan in charge . 
  it 's a political impossibility . 
  i suspect that a significant part of the turkish population also feels the same in regards to greece . 
  it is what it is , sadly . 
  turkey wo n't cooperate . 
  except your * source * does n't provide any sources other than '' * unnamed officials in brussels * '' , the only offer of '' asisstance '' that has come from frontex [ has to do with guarding the northern border with macedonia and keeping the immigrants in greece ] ( http://mobile.reuters.com/article/gca-global-migration/iduskbn0tm2b120151203 ) and common patrols with turkey * do * raise a serious issue of national sovereignty due to ever-present tensions over the aegean . 
  not to mention that the so-called `` eu humanitarian aid '' is peanuts compared to what 's really needed . 
  oh , i can recognize humour alright . 
  and attempts at it . 
  that post was n't either . 
  nobody is forwarding anything . 
  they move up there all by themselves . 
  if you 're taking about detention camps , they do exist . 
  but more are needed and funds are seriously lacking . 
  as does trained manpower . 
  so , what is the greek military supposed to do when human traffickers deliberately sink their own boats and leave refugees to drown ? 
  refugees which , by the way , turkey abosolutely refuses to take back . 
  also , i do n't know if you 're aware , but most of greece 's `` huge '' military is just kinda sitting there . 
  military mobilisation requires money , and greece does n't have any . 
  did i say it has ? 
  i was talking about what ( admittedly misinformed and out of touch ) people thing . 
  and the greek army * currently * one of the larger ones in the eu . 
  [ period ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_of_the_european_union#expenditure_and_personnel ) ( not that this is a good or productive thing , mind you ) . 
  if , for some reason , european countries start mobilizing * en masse * , it 's ranking will drop dramatically . 
  all and all , your comment was pretty pointless . 
  i swear between this and statements like '' * well , greece has a big navy . 
  they better use it !, 
  * '' , i 'm starting to believe that people are getting so out-of-touch , soon , nothing sort of navy cruisers firing torpedoes at migrant boats will satisfy them . 
  i had one guy on another site seriously suggest to me that the greek army ( being on of the larger ones in the eu ) should * intervene in syria * and create safe zones so people wo n't keep coming to europe . 
  kick germany out , let eu become * le glorious third french empire * it was always meant to be . 
  who shat on your k\u00f6ttbullar ? 
  for some reason , this is also crossposted at r/conspiracy ... 
  that 's not helping if you do n't secure the borders eventually . 
  you can only re-distribute so much . 
  our local communist party is the only hardline stalinist party left in europe , with all that entails . 
  even * they * would n't do something as loon-ey and politically useless like quoting mao 's `` little red book '' unironically inside the parliament . 
  joking or not . 
  methinks corbyn needs to re-consider his choice of partners . 
  you ca n't have the opposition being regularly made a laughingstock of in a two-party system . 
  it leaves the government unchecked . 
  did n't he also want to re-open `` talks '' with argentina on the issue of the falklands , despite there being nothing to talk about ? 
  referendum and all . 
  ... is this real ? 
  i mean , i 'm not questioning the validity of the article , i 'm just asking if i have , possibly , misinterpreted something . 
  because , if what i 'm reading is for real then this guy honestly seems like he 's trying to commit political suicide . 
  and it 's not the first time he has spouted such retarded statements when it came to foreign policy . 
  are political donations from foreign countries and/or corporations even legal in spain ? 
  not to mention most of that frontex personnel was sent to the * northern * border , not the one with turkey . 
  ergo , keeping as many of the refugees as possible in greece . 
  i do n't think that 's absolute . 
  it really depends on the farm . 
  i , for example , come from a country where most agriculture is medium-sized , familly based and the `` factory farming '' on the scale you see in , say , north america , has n't really caught on . 
  i can say that most chicken ( turkeys are n't really widespread ) are treated pretty good . 
  they get their free space , a warm place to live , lots of food and protection from violent instances of pecking order & agressive males . 
  stuff like arsenic , growth hormones e.t.c. 
  are also banned . 
  why is this guy still in the office ? 
  he honestly seems to be at the very start of senility . 
  i 'm jelly :(, 
  this copypaste is largerly irrelevant when you consider that unfortunately , vegan diets are , more often than not , incomplete and not that well-planned . 
  that 's the reason a large number of vegans seem to be deficient in many important nutrients including , but not limited , to : * b12 * : [ 1 ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2933506/?tool=pubmed ) , [ 2 ] ( http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/1/131.long ) , [ 3 ] ( http://www.karger.com/article/abstract/176565 ) * creatine * : [ 1 ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14600563 ) , [ 2 ] ( http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayabstract?frompage=online&amp;aid=8207518 ) * dha * : [ 1 ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12936959 ) , [ 2 ] ( http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/82/2/327.abstract ) , [ 3 ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11083485 ) , [ 4 ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18305382 ) and * iron * : [ 1 ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7956998 ) , [ 2 ] ( http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/633s.long ) [ most plant-based supplements have shown signs of being ineffective , too . 
  ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10552882 ) besides , many of supposed `` health benifits '' of vegan/vegeterian diets have less to do with the diet itself , and more with the fact that vegans/vegeterians in general [ tend to be more health conscious . 
  ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8842068 ) [ they are less likely to smoke or drink and more likely to exercise , as well as eat fruits and veggies . 
  ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17411462/ ) on the contrary , [ veganism has been linked to poorer health , lower quality of life and mental issues by at least one major study ] ( http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0088278 ) . 
  in addition to all disruptions such a lifestyle can cause to a person 's social life . 
  [ there 's a reason more than 70 % of vegans go back to meat within one year . 
  ] ( https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animals-and-us/201412/84-vegetarians-and-vegans-return-meat-why ) also , i 'd advise you to remove * ada * from your list . 
  it weakens your arguement . 
  * ada * ( now academy of nutrition and dietetics ) is a largerly corrupt organization that has come under fire due to [ its shady dealings with big pharma & food companies , including soy firms . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/academy_of_nutrition_and_dietetics#controversy ) [ even by the majority of its own members ] ( http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19320248.2012.704748 ) . 
  not to mention that it 's known to be staffed [ by fairly biased ideological vegans/vegeterians ] ( http://vegetariannutrition.net/ ) . 
  this is especially jarring because other , much more reputable organisations like the german society for nutrition have cautioned * against * [ vegan diet ( s ) for pregnant women , babies and children ] ( https://www.dge.de/wissenschaft/weitere-publikationen/fachinformationen/vegane-ernaehrung-saeugling-kindesalter/ ) . 
  in conclusion , veganism and well meaning and potentially healthy stance to take but , imo , it 's not worth it . 
  it can be very easily done wrongly , it carries quite a few risks for your health and , at least where i live , can be quite expensive . 
  you want to improve your health * and * help the environment ? 
  [ eat more white meat ] ( http://www.wri.org/sites/default/files/uploads/emissions_from_animal_products_0.jpg ) , drink less milk ( or at least cow milk ) and buy a bicycle . 
  europe has done more than enough to cut down its emissions and help combat climate change . 
  especially compared to the rest of the developed world . 
  now , it 's up to other developed ( and developing ) superstates like us , china and india to do their part . 
  carbs , too . 
  ca n't forget those . 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cattle_slaughter_in_india#cite_note-ind-21 ) is the relevant wikipedia article and [ here ] ( http://apps.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/circulars/livestock_poultry.pdf ) is the usda report they used as a source ( pdf , relevant part starts at page 10 ) . 
  [ here 's another source ] ( http://beef2live.com/story-india-cattle-beef-0-105357 ) . 
  not gon na lie , when i first heard of those numbers , i was surprised too . 
  especially considering the reverence cows historically enjoyed in certain parts of india . 
  ssshh ... no need to pour more oil into the fire . 
  india ranks 5th in meat production and 7th in domestic consumption . 
  [ not to mention they export livestock like no tomorrow . 
  ] ( http://vetconcerns.org/2015/10/16/export-of-livestock-products-india-on-a-winning-streak/ ), 
  [ you ai n't kiddin ' . 
  wars have started for less . 
  especially in the balkans . 
  * sigh * ** warning !, 
  long post ** okay , first of all , the `` european council on foreign relations '' is not an official organ of the eu .
