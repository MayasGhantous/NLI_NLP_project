  it 's a non-profit think tank that studies & observes european foreign policy . 
  if you can say that such a thing even exists . 
  their opinions do not reflect those of the eu also :  germany , france , italy and spain are described as `` strategic partners '' - whose governments have built special bilateral relationships with russia , which has sometimes cut against the grain of common eu objectives in areas such as energy and the eu neighbourhood policy . 
  from the very link you posted . 
  i suppose you include germany and france amongst russia 's shadow-y puppets , too ? 
  second of all , nations do n't have friends , they have interests . 
  cyprus used to host a lot of russian capital in its banks . 
  that mostly went away with the collapse of the cypriot banking system . 
  greece , too , used to have a strong trade relationship with russia . 
  which is natural , given our close geography and shared culture . 
  those mostly evaporated after the sactions and counter-sanctions that went on after the crimean crisis . 
  now it 's just tourism . 
  and most tourists do n't even come from russia , they come from [ germany ] ( http://sete.gr/_fileuploads/entries/statistics/greece/international%20tourist%20arrivals%20%28non-residents%29/catid51/en/140425_arrivals%20of%20non-residents%20from%20abroad_jan-dec%202013-2012.pdf ) . 
  oh yes , [ greece imposed sanctions on russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_sanctions_during_the_ukrainian_crisis ) . 
  [ it refused to recognize the russian-created republic of crimea , too . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_general_assembly_resolution_68/262 ) so much for `` never does anything that displeases russia * in the slightest * '' . 
  greece has nothing to gain from an alliance with russia . 
  during the heat of the negotiations , tsipras went to putin to beg for money ( though it was mostly a failed intimidation tool against brussels ) and , predictably , got told now fuck off . 
  now russia is broke , too , so they do n't have anything to offer us in terms of money . 
  so , in conclusion , neither greece nor russia have anything to offer eachother . 
  russia is in no position to help greece . 
  and greece ( a member of the eu , the eurozone and * nato * ) has nothing to gain from asking help from russia , an economically disadvantaged pariah state with a paper tiger of an army . 
  finally , [ the european and american investments in greece far , * far * outnumber the russian ones ] ( http://www.enterprisegreece.gov.gr/default.asp?pid=21 ) . 
  if there are any . 
  look , sometimes , a bad deal is just a bad deal . 
  skouries would seriously mess up the area 's long time source of source of revenue , tourism , in the long them , for the sake of some sort-term mining operations . 
  that 's why it was rejected . 
  the [ 14 regional airports deal ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11809841/greece-sells-airports-to-germans-as-bundestag-prepares-for-day-of-reckoning.html ) was a good one , which is why it went on as planned , despite some whining from ideologically motivated naysayers . 
  did you just suffer a brain aneurysm while typing this ? 
  * nothing * whatsoever of what you said made any sense . 
  in any case , go back to r/conspiracy to express your paranoia about russia and its supposed control of the greek government . 
  it has to do with that typical greek neo-liberal attitude of `` any opposition to glorious foreign investment = populist leftist statism ! '', 
  never mind the repercussions such an `` investment '' will have to the local economy/environment , the corruption which enabled this deal in the first place and/or the shady practices said foreign corporation indulges in ( as well as the locals who partner with them ) . 
  no , it must be those dirty socialist statists . 
  as for the local big heads not organizing fast enough , you 're right . 
  it has to do with that unfortunate greek tendency of ignoring a leaking pipe until you 're literally drowning in water . 
  [ it is ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/yandere ), 
  yeah , because us government representatives never lobby on behalf of american megacorps ever . 
  it 's silly for anyone to try and claim the moral high ground in such business deals . 
  do n't take it personal . 
  everybody who was forced to resort to `` extreme measures '' received their fair share of outcry from bleeding hearts , at first . 
  now they 've all stopped talking and simply nod along . 
  good job . 
  props to you and all the other romanian citizens for acting out . 
  unfortunately , it seems that governments in south-eastern europe are short sighted enough to allow things to devolve to such a degree that nothing sort of widespread public unrest will stop them from carrying out their idiotic decisions . 
  i mean , ca n't they see that gold deposits , if they do exist , are finite while the ecological damage done to the area will probably last forever ? 
  [ this sounds strangely familiar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skouries_mine ), 
  they are all like this because people keep stealing them . 
  i 'd normally say this belongs to r/nottheonion , but russia is a low-hanging fruit by this point . 
  what a way to start a year ... . _ . 
  well , she was semi-correct if you consider that brazil is rightful portugese clay . 
  yes , poulty in general receive much less antibiotics than cattle . 
  pork , too . 
  though i believe the use of antibiotics on livestock is limited by law in the eu . 
  but the extent of each limit may vary from country to country . 
  here in greece they are usually used when the animal is really sick . 
  not if you 're planning to have three gyros-pita sandwiches with meat , onions , tomato , french fries , paprika , tzatziki sauce and ketchup for dinner !, 
  pork will absolutely wreck your stomach and keep you awake all night . 
  chicken is a ligther , more refined meet . 
  pork ( and lamb ) are for mid-day lunch . 
  or when you take your girl out for a romantic date in the local * souvlatzidiko * . 
  just switch from red meat to white meat . 
  even the un recommends it . 
  plus , it does n't make you feel as `` filled '' as red meat , you know ? 
  chicken gyros is best gyros . 
  my government ... has said * a lot * of dumb things in short period of time . 
  but i do n't think they ever said something of the sort . 
  not putting my hand on fire though . 
  it could be matter of different interpretations, 
  something which might have applied back when adorno wrote it ( * i personally disagree * ) , but within the context of modern greece , it comes across as somewhat generalising and absolute . 
  a great many bureaucrats in greece are honest and hardworking , if not fed up with their job ( s ) . 
  especially the lower-level ones . 
  the system itself might be bloated and corrupt , but that does n't mean all the people who staff it are the same . 
  turks are no less white than greeks or italians . 
  no one is forcing poor people to pay for anything . 
  there 's a huge variety of sources for agri-products in greece , and their prices are quite reasonable . 
  it 's gmos who can be uncompetitively cheap . 
  simply put , flooding the greek market with cheap foreign stuff would 1 ) lower the quality of our product ( s ) and 2 ) potentitally hit local farmers hard , which would severey damage agriculture . 
  agriculture is one of the few sections of greek economy not overly ravaged by the crisis . 
  it employs a lot of people , * feeds * a lot of families and helps rejuvenate local small markets ( there 's a reason the country side has n't been hit as hard as the big cities ) . 
  i do n't see why it should n't be protected on the grounds of `` muh free market '' . 
  plus , there 's also the environmental issue of monocultures that usually goes along with gmos ( yes , not only with gmos , i know ) . 
  while monocultures are present in greece , they are not nearly as widespread as in many other countries . 
  and i have many friends and relatives working in the agricultural sector right now who would assure you that , while it has been hit hard , like everything else in greece , compared to other businesses , agriculture is absolutely * thriving * . 
  tourism and shipping are also doing rather good , but the first is too dependant on seasons and the second rarely pays any tax . 
  most greek shipping companies are n't located in greece anymore . 
  and , please , if there 's one group which has absolutely * gorged * on eu funds , it 's the farmers . 
  the amount of scamming that went down during the `` golden days '' between the mid-80s and the early 00s is sickening . 
  that kid is going to have * a lot * to brag about in school . 
  best childhood ever . 
  well , greece has been part of the free market for decades . 
  by trading with other europeab countries , all under the cap . 
  we are perfectly satisfied with that . 
  the greek agricultural sector has been one of the least economically hit industries in greece . 
  [ its products are rated among the best in europe ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/07/04/greek-fruit-and-vegetables-among-the-safest-in-eu/ ) . 
  it ai n't gon na stay that way if we start importing cheap , non-european crap . 
  true . 
  it serves no practical purpose . 
  besides , eu yields are higher than us 's, 
  literally * all * of western europe has a higher life expectancy than the us .
