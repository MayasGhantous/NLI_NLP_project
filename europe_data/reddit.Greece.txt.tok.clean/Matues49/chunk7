  it has been crossed . 
  except he 's not defending shit . 
  he 's just dumping the problem on someone else 's shoulders . 
  and he 's not doing even * that * properly . 
  shut greece off , and they 'll just travel a few sea miles more and keep coming in from italy . 
  not that the comment you 're replying to is n't an overreaction , but this is r/europe talking about the refugee crisis , poe 's law galore . 
  use / s. 
  europe would also be partially un-fucked if every country did its duty and took in its share of refugees . 
  but that none of my business ... 
  they 'll just change their route and keep comming in from italy . 
  building walls wo n't change that . 
  besides , greece is , too , collectively tired of europe treating it like a human dumping ground . 
  but you do n't see it pulling a mass expulsion and sending all that rapemageddon up north in one night . 
  so clench your teeth and bear with us . 
  in so many words , yes . 
  he likely means the ones with bulgaria , fyrom e.t.c. 
  still a cunty thing to say though . 
  so his proposition is to build a `` frontier '' on the * northern * border of greece , halt the migrant flow and more or less dump it right back into greece where ... everyone can rot , for all he cares . 
  well , fuck me , thanks for the european solidarity there , viktor . 
  good . 
  absolutely . 
  although it will undoubtly take time and effort , i think serbia becoming a member of the eu should be a sought after goal . 
  it 's stance during the refugee crisis helped reinforce that opinion . 
  now that 's a nice way to for 2016 to start . 
  you keep hearing all these depressing stuff going on in our neighborhood of east med , it 's nice to see some positivity once in a while . 
  lets hope more such reconciliation events happen this year . 
  what 's up with them blue nips ? 
  ` merican army is always above all . 
  except if it tries to take away * muh freedums * . 
  in that case , it will be halted by ~ ~ fat , trailer trash rednecks with aks ~ ~ patriotic , armed citizen-militia . 
  the ft link is just an opinion piece on a blog , and not a very good one , at that . 
  nothing worth reading . 
  this needs to be the new $ 1 coin . 
  only with the rose under the skull dripping blood . 
  rated d for * dat ass *, 
  it 's a shame that here in greece we ca n't utilize all that sunlight properly . 
  it 's one of the few things we have in abundance . 
  but then again , these are difficult times and green energy can be expensive . 
  to be fair , the cia came ^ ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) into the picture much later . 
  it was originally gayropa meant to orchestrate the coup . 
  however , all their covert operatives got carried away and ended-up having a huge , cocaine-fueled homosexual orgy \u00e0 la belgian police . 
  consequently , their yankee overlords had to step in and do their job for them yet again . 
  such is life in the decadent west . 
  you 're talking about the $ 11bn given on ** march 2014 ** , the $ 1.8 bn package of macro-financial assistance that was proposed on ** 8 january 2015 ** or the eu-ukraine association agreementint that was signed on ** 27 june 2014 ** ? 
  all * after * the russian military intervention that happened on ** [ february 20 2014 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014%e2%80%9315_russian_military_intervention_in_ukraine ) ** ? 
  besides , the eu tried to forge closer ties with a * willing * ukrainian gov. 
  that had just been established by popular revolt against a russian client regime that was in the process of using deadly against its own demonstrating citizens . 
  what 's so shady about that ? 
  so how about you read your * own * citations before you decide to post them and oh-so-passionately defend an opinion . 
  we are done here . 
  it 's probably the corruption from the one ring speaking . 
  it was a ** trade deal ** with a country that had just been illegally * invaded and occupied * by its agressive neighbor . 
  said neighbor also had the previous government under its thumb for decades . 
  what happened to it was n't a coup . 
  it was an uprising against a corrupt , autocratic and largerly incompetent regime that managed to stay in power through dubious means and had just opened fire against its own citizens . 
  there 's trying to see something from another point of view and there 's outright trying to twist reality and being disingenuous , seriously . 
  not to be underestimated in regards to what ? 
  wrecking his country 's economy and tarnishing its international reputation ? 
  yeah , he managed that in no time . 
  a european politico-economic union establishing a trade relationship with another european country , especially after that country has been invaded , illegally occupied & financially strangled by an agressive foreign power , is not the same with funding a `` coup '' . 
  not to mention that overthrowing a corrupt , authoritarian government propped-up by said foreign power stretches the definition of a coup . 
   this is n't some glorious liberation of an oppressed state , it 's the eu taking over influence of a russian sphere of influence state * via a coup d'etat it helped fund . 
  * citation needed . 
  like , * really * needed . 
  it 'll happen sooner than you think . 
  10 years ago , civil unions being recognized in greece was considered something between a joke and utterly unthinkable . 
  last year , it happened and no one even noticed . 
  even the queen does n't like chinese tourists . 
  true but the type of shitposting that goes on in r/the _ donald would only end up triggering erdogan even more . 
  hadrian would be proud . 
  have strength : /, 
  erdogan needs to open a tumblr account because he keeps getting * triggered * . 
  judging by the lightning speed and success of the attack , i 'm guessing they used the dreaded emu army . 
  damn downunders . 
  same thing happened at the migrant camps in idomeni ( though i do n't know if the perpetrators were british ) . 
  foreign `` activists '' stated spreading leaflets warning the refugees that the borders would open soon and not to trust the greek authorities who wanted to take them in accommodation centers ( and away from the rain and the mud ) . 
  most pointless and fucked-up shit i 've seen in a while , i tell you . 
  i knew you french really liked your strikes/protests but this is borderline addiction !, 
  red tourism , the most new age-y mix of capitalism & socialism this side of the med . 
  * experience true world revolution in our agrarian people 's communes on majestic crete for 25 $ per week !, 
  imported anarchists again ? 
  damn , at this rate they 'll soon outnumber our food imports . 
  * glorious yuropean tiger *, 
  crooked dave . 
  once the prices and the cost of living also become similar to estonia 's , then sure . 
  but if they take hike everytime someone tries holding them to the same standard ( s ) as taxi drivers , then what 's the difference from banning them ? 
  the only thing collapsing right now is your mental state , judging by the full-blown breakdown you are having . 
  seriously , take a chill pill . 
  go jerk off to a picture of ayn rand or something . 
  it takes a special kind of audacity to call someone an idiot while posting on r/anarcho _ capitalism . 
  off to somalia with you . 
  go one and live your dream , and leave actual , functional society alone . 
  no , they are n't . 
  enough with this meme . 
  taxi companies are many and vary from piss-poor to excellent , with most being at least relatively decent . 
  uber , on the other hand , is one company and it 's shit . 
  uber is scummy as fuck . 
  i do n't know why reddit keeps jizzing all over them like they are some sort of blessing .
