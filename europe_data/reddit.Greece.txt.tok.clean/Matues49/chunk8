  attacking the source is pointless . 
  the article i linked contains many citations , and the incidents its describing can be double-checked with a simple google search . 
  sorry if you ca n't bear anything going against your black-and-white worldview . 
  pork , like chicken , actually ranks pretty low on the emissions scale . 
  you mean like [ this ] ( http://www.naiaonline.org/articles/article/deception-in-the-name-of-animal-rights#sthash.7rbsechb.dpbs ) ? 
  or [ this ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/06/a-dogs-purpose-abuse-video-falsified-american-humane ) funny little tale ? 
  face it , a large number of ` animal rights ' activists are , more often than not , single-minded cultists who are willing to deceptively edit , cherry pick or even outright fabricate videos in order to advance their agenda . 
  the source for this very video is sketchy as fuck . 
  surrounded by all this sea , some men are bound to become salty . 
  joke 's on them , liechtenstein is one of the very few countries in europe that reached their greatest extent and * preserved it * to this day . 
  empires fell , republics crumbled , unions splintered ... but tiny liechtenstein endured . 
  when meeting with world leaders , trump always looks like he has no idea what he 's doing there . 
  small countries have to get by with what limited resources they have . 
  hungary was n't prepared , and certainly did n't ask , for such a large influx of people . 
  besides , it 's a temporary solution . 
  probably another one of those first world anarchist turds . 
  because nothing says ` stick it to the system ' like injuring random low-level , minimun wage mailmen . 
  these clowns are just as bad as golden dawn . 
  unlike the president himself who seems to be giving zero fucks . 
  me attempting to be sportive . 
  [ tmw when you 've run out of journalists to prosecute and you literally have to import . 
  people in the comments were expecting him to get robbed , raped and cannibalized or something . 
  great docu nonetheless . 
  past wagons had bill clinton groping women in the ( exposed , no less ) tits . 
  that 's a carneval for you . 
  it 's a * joke * . 
  carnevals in europe are all about crude humour . 
  another wagon had merkel depicted as a grotesque cyclops and tsipras firing arrows at her face . 
  does that constitute violence , too ? 
  the government actually still controls the public power corporation by 51.1 % . 
  the privatisation deal go stuck in limbo when tsipras was elected . 
  plus , i 'd find it * very * hard to trust the greek state with setting up & running a nuclear plant properly . 
  like , * trusting-erdogan-to uphold-democratic-principles * - level of hard . 
  they dug up pics from a carneval during the clinton presidency lol these people are saltier than salt mines in romania . 
  how it is ? 
  clowns . 
  what 's up with those oddly-shaped islands north of scotland speaking klingon ? 
  they are there on * every * linguistic map , being stubbornly different even from other gaelic speakers . 
  are they like asterix 's undefeatable little village or something ? 
  i do n't think it was a 100 % false flag but i would n't be surprised if erdogan & co knew about it beforehands , let those low-level officers blunder ahead with their attempted coup and then crushed it just the right time so akp could get its own reichstag fire . 
  the fuck ? 
  all normal people hate math . 
  i mean , they are both under sharia law amirite ? 
  i bet it 's the bowling green butchers striking again . 
  i thought that was the british house of commons . 
  this + lucky luke + iznogoud = my pre-bedtime reading stash . 
  every night . 
  even now , as an adult , i 'll buy anything i did n't manage to collect as a kid . 
  just go away , tayyip . 
  it is . 
  notice the islands and [ chalkidiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chalkidiki ) . 
  rip to all our dead in ~ ~ patras ~ ~ bowling green . 
  the effects of that horrific massacre are still being felt ; _ ;, 
  here in norhern greece , the after effects of chernobyl are still being felt and mess up the pollution ratings in certain regions . 
  this disaster hit us pretty hard . 
  i think it 's part of the general nuclear phobia that 's still widespread in greece ( and the overreliance on coal for power ) . 
  well , that and the earthquakes . 
  [ he looks like the bad guy from pirates of the caribbean . 
  it 'll keep failing to materialize once the shortcomings of his administration become clearer every week . 
  even in america itself , it 's happening . 
  look at his abysmal approval ratings . 
  i think that , after 2020 , this whole thing will be looked upon as the us 's unfortunate , but brief , mid-life crisis . 
  rip . 
  twisted and harsh as it may sound , given the circumstances , it was , sadly , the right decision . 
  no one deserves to end up on an isis torture/execution vid . 
  this is some pretty darn disgraceful behaviour by the romanian gov. 
  and i 've seen a fuckton of skeevy behaviour from local politicians in my lifetime . 
  i hope the people hit the streets and give them hell . 
  she has more hair in her ` brows than i have on my armpits . 
  australia alone is not enough . 
  bring * all * the former european colonies to fold . 
  we did it , reddit !, 
  * no breaks * on the eurotrain !, 
  i like how this sub went from forts-to castles-to cattle-to kettle within a few days . 
  like , no linear way of thought at all . 
  just motivated by the power of shitposting . 
  edit : btw , that * is * a nice bright red kettle . 
  nicer than those my grandma used to have , who were either white or rusty brown . 
  good god , how will i possibly cope with this after getting used to living , all this time , with only a miniscule-to-mild debt problem ?

  i have love/hate relationship with british tabloids . 
  pls stop withdrawing from everything, 
  the comments under that vid are beyond pathetic , even by youtube standards . 
  some dangerous pussies . 
  heh , greece is in a bad spot but i 'm not deluded to think it ca n't get any worse . 
  as in , dagestan-level worse . 
  oh , it 'll be fun watching those loons have a meltdown , no doubt . 
  but what worries me is the side effects of trump potentially wrecking the us economy . 
  because , for the better or worse , in this new globalist world , everything is connected . 
  if they suffer , that means china suffers and that means we suffer . 
  well , this is n't gon na help their image much . 
  such as it is . 
  took 'em long enough . 
  trade war with china , trade conflicts with the eu , tariffs on mexico , shutting down the nafta ... does this man want set the global economy on fire ? 
  because that 's how you set the global economy on fire . 
  suck on * that * , ` kippers . 
  i hate it when this happens . 
  darn romans copy everything  :(,
