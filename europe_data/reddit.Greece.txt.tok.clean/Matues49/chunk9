  excessive privatization has been a disaster everywhere it was implemented . 
  the greek state has * a lot * of dead weight it needs to get rid of and sectors it needs to make more efficient . 
  but that just means moving our standards closer to , say , austria 's . 
  anything more is libertiarian-esque nonsense . 
  but why though ? 
  is it migrant communities , whose kids usually marry younger ? 
  or tories clamping down on abortions/sex ed ? 
  85 % of that spending goes towards mps ' wives new home furniture . 
  the rest goes to the military . 
  wtf , uk ? 
  i thought he was gon na be the new uk ambassador to the us . 
  [ i got you , fam . 
  thanks , obama ; _ ;, 
  all those jesus freaks of various stripes taking the stand and talking about how blessed this day is and/or how america is a shining city on a hill are so creepy . 
  not even surprised by greece  _  but i am surprised by italy . 
  i knew things were bad but not * this * bad . 
  i mean , it 's not like italy is some bumfuck s. european backwater , it has the third largest economy in the eurozone . 
  well , i do n't disagree in spirit but ... really , sergey ? 
   angry french ... attack must be tuesday . 
  as is to be expected from pseudo-patriotic , anti-eu , populist dildos such as boris . 
  [ it 's not the first time he has made this comparison either ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/14/boris-johnson-the-eu-wants-a-superstate-just-as-hitler-did/ ) . 
  we had several like-minded morons pulling the nazi card here in greece , too . 
  i wo n't be surprised if trump also goes there at some point . 
  probably during a 3 a.m. twitter rant . 
  tl ; dr : it does n't matter if war happened in the past or takes place now , because when it comes , we 'll all be radioactive ash . 
  have n't seen them any in a while : /, 
  ah , i remember those from the early 2000 's . 
  ( western ) european kids enterntainment has historically given a surprising low amount of fucks re moral guardians . 
  : [ this cartoon ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke6jnvk3awq ), 
  well , there goes the neighborhood ... must be that time of the century again . 
  russia will disintegrate , too . 
  at best , it 'll end up the tallest midget in the room . 
  these are gon na be some * looong * 4 years ... 
  i * knew * something was wrong with the head line !, 
  i could n't pinpoint it , but it seriously bugged me . 
  france has the third largest nuclear stockpile in the world , does n't it ? 
  if his unpopularity numbers and the fact that he lost the popular vote are anything to go by , the american people are already realizing the depth of their blunder . 
  the midterms could be a first step towards reversing this . 
  by 2021 , trump and his ilk will , hopefully , be a bad memory . 
  after all , if we in europe have proven anything , is that every country is bound to make * at least * one catastrophic electoral mistake during its history . 
  trump officials should be worried about their boss 's mental health . 
  which seems to be already falling apart , [ if we go by his twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/820257714362314753 ) . 
  tayyip , y u got ta be like dis ? 
  not exactly terrorists , more like [ crazy gun nuts ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfuszrwcfd0 ) . 
  think eurotexans . 
  ya , i 'm from cancerland . 
  can confirm . 
  brown coal has shortened the lifespan of every household by , at least , 4 years . 
  every month you hear about new cases . 
  and there 's a good chance its people you know , too . 
  but this frozen hellhole is also one of the few genuinely industrialised places in the country , so it 's not all bad : , 
  good for poland . 
  it 's never too late to get into the whole ` colonies ' business . 
  babies cost mad money . 
  it 's been surprise attacked and occupied by turkmenistan for the glory of turan . 
  it 's like one of those ` russian invasion ' alternate history maps . 
  at least they did n't ask him if he supports the nato bombing of agrabah . 
  why tho ? 
  outside of scoring some political points by pandering to the public perception of immigration , it does n't make much economic sense . 
  poland and , from there , ' * be deployed across eastern europe * ' , according to the article . 
  my guess is the baltics . 
  if anyone needs assurances right now , it 's them . 
  there 's a lot of pussy-lovin ' in central europe . 
  it 's left of breitbart so people are butthurt . 
   grasping migrants this seems oddly specific . 
  you mean the ` migrant rescuers ' or the far-rightists ? 
  i bet the baltics can live with that . 
   but the defend europe venture has not been an unmitigated success . 
  first , the c-star was held up for a week in the suez canal by egyptian authorities looking for weapons . 
  then some of its sri lankan crew jumped ship when it docked in the cypriot port of famagusta last month ; several reportedly asked for asylum . 
  lol, 
  you people are weird . 
  i mean , why not ? 
  we already know that moscow metro would be an ideal place to survive a nuclear apocalypse . 
  i just shop my eggs from the farmers market . 
  lots of small villages around my town where families produce their own stuff and come to sell them here . 
  is that ... is that littlefinger on the last one ? 
   its `` african heat '' i blame open borders . 
  i wonder if he asked to accept jesus as their lord & saviour before . 
  ottomans . 
  even the mountains offer no escape . 
   * `` i endured as much as i could [ not to tell them names of other people ] , but i broke when they showed me a video of the tortures . 
  they filmed it themselves . 
  they caught a guy , he allegedly had contacts with terrorists . 
  they brought in a hollow tube and a barbwire . 
  they put a tube inside of him . 
  in his anus . 
  then they put the barbed wire inside this tube . 
  then they took the tube out . 
  then they were slowly pulling the barbed wire out . 
  when i saw that video and realized they had already brought the tube and the barbed wire i broke . 
  i agreed to collaborate with them . '' * well , damn . 
  these nutters almost always tend to make sure the tortures they inflict on these poor people are sexually sadistic/humiliating in nature . 
  why are bigots so obsessed with gay sex ? 
   cuntrymen damn son , i understand being angry at close-minded people but there 's no reason to be this harsh . 
  all this shitshow tells me is that europe needs to step up its game and try to become truly energy independent . 
  i love collecting coins from other member-states and ` special edition ' ones like this ( in this case celebrating the 10th anniversary of economic and monetary union ) . 
  the rarer , the better . 
  must have around 100 $ in unique eurocoins by now . 
  * muslims made me do it !,
