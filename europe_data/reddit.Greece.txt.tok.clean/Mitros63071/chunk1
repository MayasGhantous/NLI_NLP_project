kicking down greece was overall better than messing uo all of europe hard to argue with that first grade european humanism . 
  but , if we 're going to go down that path , might as well be frank about instead of celebrating the glorious and generations salvation of the greek people by the almighty and all-wise europeans , would n't you say ? 
  and ??? 
  the whole topic of our discussion was , as i recall , orthodox minorities in turkey . 
  if you honestly ca n't see what 's wrong with a minority going from 200,000 to 2,000 and 2 million to 50-70 ,000 , while complaining about the turkish minority in thrace , which is doing just fine with its own mps in greece 's parliament etc. 
  you 've obviously got some problems . 
  you have ethnic greek background ? 
  so what ? 
  there 's people across the mediterranean , all the way to sweden 's royals with greek blood , so ? 
  that does n't make you greek . 
  i probably have some turkish blood in me and i know for a fact that there 's french blood in me . 
  does that make me turkish or french ? 
  get your head out of your ass and stop wasting my time . 
  where 's the racism ? 
   we still have greeks and armenians . 
  oh yes , loads of 'em . 
  `` armenians in turkey ( turkish : t\u00fcrkiye ermenileri ; armenian : \u0539\u0578\u0582\u0580\u0584\u0561\u0570\u0561\u0575\u0565\u0580 , also \u0539\u0580\u0584\u0561\u0570\u0561\u0575\u0565\u0580 , `` turkish armenians '' ) , one of the indigenous peoples of turkey , have an estimated population of 50,000 to 70,000 , [ 4 ] [ 5 ] down from 2 million in 1914 '' `` they are the remnants of the estimated 200,000 greeks who were permitted under the provisions of the convention concerning the exchange of greek and turkish populations to remain in turkey following the 1923 population exchange , [ 7 ] which involved the forcible resettlement of approximately 1.5 million greeks from anatolia and east thrace and of half a million turks from all of greece except for western thrace . 
  after years of persecution ( e.g. 
  the varl\u0131k vergisi and the istanbul pogrom ) , emigration of ethnic greeks from the istanbul region greatly accelerated , reducing the 119,822 [ 8 ] - strong greek minority before the attack to about 7,000 by 1978 . 
  [ 9 ] the 2008 figures released by the turkish foreign ministry places the current number of turkish citizens of greek descent at the 3,000 -- 4,000 mark . 
  [ 5 ] however , according to the human rights watch the greek population in turkey is estimated at 2,500 in 2006 . 
  the greek population in turkey is collapsing as the community is now far too small to sustain itself demographically , due to emigration , much higher death rates than birth rates and continuing discrimination . '', 
  perhaps you should learn more . 
  the problem is many in europe assume that their money is used to pay for our pensions etc. 
  besides , if those debts were not paid or forgiven , the european banking system would collapse , it was n't exactly out of sympathy . 
  edit :  `` the aid packages were first and foremost used to rescue european banks , '' esmt president j\u00f6rg rocholl told handelsblatt . 
  `` the european taxpayers have bailed out the private investors , '' he added . 
  as the article puts it . 
  well the fact that you never recognised one or more genocides that helped you build your nation , along with the very conservative and anti-integration nature of your diaspora in europe and your occupation of half of cyprus , while having an active casus belli on greece , probably did n't help . 
  hey , we ai n't that uneducated !, 
  you 're probably thinking of a canadian map ( slightly more educated than the austria = austarlia us map ) . 
  and you needed to point that out 'cause ? ... 
  we know what 's best , mighty folks of ausonia , 
  northern italy has quite a similar culture to most of southern europe and they seem to be doing alright . 
  wow !, 
  what a level of arguements !, 
  thanks for not wasting my time further !, 
  he means that we 're being divided and driven back into nationalism and racism , even though we 've already seen where that road leads . 
  and something tells me , america is n't footing the bill for this one . 
  as opposed to the lack of arrogance implied by saying that a whole nation can not advise anyone on economics ever again ... 
  do you know many friends who have an active casus belli between them ? 
  [ `` never dies '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wytalxmhjma ), 
   it 's not about the treaty . 
  welcome to the world of international law . 
  if it ai n't in a treaty , nobody cares . 
   i 've seen members of your parliament openly denying that there are any turks at all in greece . 
  according to the treaty , there are n't . 
   we were n't doing that in the 70s . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/istanbul_pogrom and i quote : `` were organized mob attacks directed primarily at istanbul 's greek minority on 6 -- 7 september 1955 . 
  the riots were orchestrated by the tactical mobilization group , the seat of operation gladio 's turkish branch ; the counter-guerrilla , and national security service , the precursor of today 's national intelligence organization . 
  [ 4 ] the events were triggered by the false news that the turkish consulate in thessaloniki , in northern greece -- the house where mustafa kemal atat\u00fcrk had been born in 1881 -- had been bombed the day before . 
  [ 5 ] a bomb planted by a turkish usher at the consulate , who was later arrested and confessed , incited the events . 
  the turkish press , conveying the news in turkey , was silent about the arrest and instead insinuated that greeks had set off the bomb . 
  [ 6 ] a turkish mob , most of which had been trucked into the city in advance , assaulted istanbul 's greek community for nine hours . 
  although the mob did not explicitly call for greeks to be killed , over a dozen people died during or after the attacks as a result of beatings and arson . 
  armenians were also harmed . 
  the police remained mostly ineffective , and the violence continued until the government declared martial law in \u0130stanbul and called in the army to put down the riots . '', 
  `` punitive turkish nationalist exclusivist measures , such as a 1932 parliamentary law , barred greek citizens living in turkey from a series of 30 trades and professions from tailoring and carpentry to medicine , law and real estate . 
  [ 2 ] the varl\u0131k vergisi tax imposed in 1942 also served to reduce the economic potential of greek businesspeople in turkey . '', 
  i have n't seen you do anything but talk shit so far . 
  you ai n't one to talk . 
   the treaty never explicitely obliged us to which part of this did you not understand ? 
   you guys do n't give them any self determination ] we do n't have to . 
   it 's like my government in the 70s but happening today . 
  is the greek gov ' t inciting anti-turkish riots and imposing special taxes on turks ? 
  still better than yours . 
  we voted no . 
  tsipras let germany fuck him . 
  wow , i am the personification of greece now ? 
  can i declare bunkruptcy like people do ?!, 
  how ` bout , instead of the messenger you deal with the message . 
  the dude who sent it to me said he was `` glad it got demolished '' as it was an `` eyesore to watch while driving by '' . 
  your guess is as good as mine . 
   `` german security policy has relevance -- also far beyond our country , '' the paper states . 
  `` germany is willing to join early , decisively and substantially as a driving force in international debates ... to take responsibility and assume leadership '' . 
  i 'll translate : `` we ca n't do foreign interventions and proper imperialism , like the uk and france , due to losing wwii , so we just wan na hide behind the big ` eu shield ' and do it anyway . '', 
  how ` bout no ? 
  you lost the war , get over it . 
  rich countries will provide it with weapons and leadership , while reaping the benfits of its foreign interventions . 
  poor countries will be cannon fodder . 
  if anything , germany is the one benefiting from this , since the uk and france can do imperialism just fine on their own . 
  those guys ca n't even lead the eu 's economic policy , now they want us to become an army for them ? 
  how about we bend over and let them fuck us , too ? 
  yay !, 
  let 's all let turkey invade syria . 
  what could possibly go wrong ? 
  i mean , who gives a fuck about international law and the refugee waves this shit creates ? 
  the treaty never explicitely obliged us to . 
  unlike you , however , we did n't kick them out and we have n't repealed any sections of the treaty . 
  now go on , downvote me 'cause you 're more and you have no actual arguements . 
  the muslims in thrace are just fine . 
  much more than i can say for the greeks in imbros , tenedos , constantinople and the propontis in general . 
   http://www.erolsasmaz.com/?oku=730 a turk provided me with this . 
  happy now ? 
   the interest rate is considerably below market rate and ? 
  being lower than something even higher does n't make it low . 
   you just called me a prejudiced racist . 
  you do n't want to be insulted - fine . 
  so how about you do n't insult first ?!, 
  you are a prejudiced racist .
