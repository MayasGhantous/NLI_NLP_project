  and do n't get me started on that wall we 'll build and make the turks pay for . 
   gouvernement that lovely little francism . 
   it is going to be a shit show . 
  i heard that alain jupp\u00e9 is running , which is good as he has experience . 
  other than that , sarkozy and hollande are a shit-show and let 's not even talk about lepen . 
   the spanish lack of gouvernement wo n't help either to construct strong fondations . 
  precisely . 
  one can only hope that they get a stable , competent gov ' t that 's anti-austerity ( the same miracle greece is praying for ) but that seems to be doubtful at best . 
   if you want us in like most greeks i 'm an unapologetic francophile , so i would n't mind it , as long as you do n't end up being like the germans . 
  i 'm certain we could come to an understanding that 's beneficial for all of us ( like the v4 and the germans have done in financial matters ) , especially since our systems and economies are so similar . 
  exactly how i feel :(, 
   this should show anyone that the eu is n't german . 
  the fact there 's a need for this shows that the eu is franco-german and increasingly german . 
  it also shows that there 's strong regional tensions . 
  who do you think where the first ones to talk crap about the summit ? 
  i do n't have high expectations , since the bloc will probably be pushed around due to its current weak leadership , but it sets a good precedent for the future . 
   it does n't even make sense to me why people in spain search for `` the english are strange '' [ they 're just salty .

   why does greece play without spectators [ paok ] ( http://www.fcpaok.net/images/stories/edit/2013/paok_urukhai.jpg ) , that 's why . 
  i really like the idea of a united southern europe . 
  problem is , save for the cypriot president ( and maybe the portuguese pm about whom i do n't know much ) there does n't seem to be much in the way of serious leadership at the moment . 
  because it takes extreme strength to bully a weaker country into submission . 
  [ `` so you 've cheating and lying - and europe will pay the price ? 
  '' ] ( http://www.englishblog.com/2015/09/cartoon-volkswagen-emissions-scandal.html ), 
  maybe they want some change so they do n't need welfare anymore ? 
  maybe they recognised that it would hurt their pockets but they put nation above pound ? 
  maybe that money goes to poor foreigners and not locals ? 
  maybe they 're tired of cheap labour from eastern europe and elsewhere lowering real wages to tartarus ? 
  i do realise that for eu-bots , many of whom are well-off , it might seem completely alien that people might vote based on something other than money ( * cough * `` no '' vote in greek referendum * cough * ) but hey , that 's just me being a lazy greek leech , right ? 
  ps : bring on the downvotes , ad hominem attacks and `` i hope greece sinks like atlantis '' comments bros. 
  i 'd love to tend to them , but unlike 1 % kiddies getting summer jobs that pay eur 2000 per month in the eu parliament ( true story ) with their only qualification being fluency in a language or two , i actually need to work for my future . 
  peace !, 
  dunno but thanks for telling it as it is , southern brother . 
  we should latin union/roman empire again . 
  [ `` the epilogue to the 2006 edition provides a rebuttal to the current move by the g8 nations to forgive third world debt . 
  perkins charges that the proposed conditions for this debt forgiveness require countries to privatise their health , education , electric , water and other public services . 
  those countries would also have to discontinue subsidies and trade restrictions that support local business , but accept the continued subsidization of certain g8 businesses by the us and other g8 countries , and the erection of trade barriers on imports that threaten g8 industries .

  says the german ... say , when are you opting out of the london debt agreement and paying your debts ? 
  oh that 's right , the unforgiving servant is not a man of moral consistency . 
  ports have been sold . 
  where is the discussion about debt relief we were promised ? 
  `` \u039c\u03c0\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1 '' ( byra ) is a slangy foreign loanword . 
  the proper greek word is `` \u0396\u03cd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 '' ( zythos ) . 
  hmm yes and i see it has taken a horrific toll on vw ... 
  applying personal relations to international diplomacy ... a great idea , indeed . 
  so great that if we followed it , germany would have 0 population because everyone there would have been hanged post the school massacre of wwii . 
  also , if the `` criminal '' has been convicted then it 's the point that it 's ok for you to break relations and only depending on the crime and the degree to which they have or have not regretted it . 
  nordic humour at its finest xd, 
  i guess i gave you too much credit by assuming that you 'd realise my comment was a meta-comment about all the eu fanboys ( especially from v4 countries ) circle-jerking on how brexit will destroy the uk in this thread and / r/europe ( or / r/eu as it should be called post-brexit ) . 
  you and the other eu-bots have produced enough salt to power the whole world 's electricity needs using a salt-based reactor after brexit . 
  the dutch are in the v4 now ? 
  i never would have guessed . 
  lol more butthurt eu-bots and v4 scrubs who wo n't be able to leech off the uk anymore . 
  if i ever see farage , i 'm buying the man a pint !, 
  why not ? 
  why should any of us cut relations with russia for an issue that does not concern us ? 
  this is something for the un to handle . 
  and even if this somehow is an eu issue by any stretch of the matter , guess who 'll be leaving the eu soon and needs to clear the way for when that happens ? 
  i would give you gold if i could . 
  i still wonder , how long will it take for the eu commission to punish vw ? 
  if it was a greek industry , it would have been closed down months ago . 
  no you need a casus belli , un approval and/or a declaration of war . 
  but when has turkey ever cared for petty concepts such as `` international law '' ? 
  prc recognizes a taiwanese declaration of independence in exchange for a permanent blockade . 
  deal . 
   there is obviously a clash of ideas of how to deal with the situation . 
  if hungary has broken a treaty in regards to migrant quotas as the ec suggests , why have they not taken sufficient legal action towards hungary ? 
  because that would require eu legal action against all eastern european eu states , who are germany 's main trade partners for car parts and because there is a stark opposition to the quotas by many in the eu ( including germans ) . 
  in short , for the same reason vw has n't been punished : germany does n't want it . 
  none . 
  how about refusing migrant quotas ? 
  are pretending you do n't see the connection there or are you just incapable of reading basic english ? 
  if you want eu funds for some things , you must abide by eu treaties and agreements in all things . 
  we love you too , not-sweden-not-denmark < 3, 
   the eu money is given to hungary to build infrastructure , not to help migrants . 
  they did n't use eu money to build the wall . 
  so you 're perfectly fine with using eu money for one thing and not abiding by its treaties ? 
  from what i 've heard , pizza is considered more as an everyday/junk ( not american junk , it 's still italian cooking so it puts other junk food to shame ) food , so i do n't get why people would it in a restaurant , when there 's tons of better stuff in a restaurant . 
  that just might be the fact that i think of pizza as fast food . 
  not taking in the refugees that the eu agreement mandates breaches eu treaties . 
  as for hungary using its own money , i guess it 's got some spare cash , with its infrastructure being built by eu funds and so on . 
   rectangular pizza had no idea such a thing existed . 
  my mother used to make it that way and i thought it was heresy . 
  sooo ... romana , calabresa or napolitana ? 
  even acknowledging israel 's existence is enough for a war there xd, 
  how to start a fight between italians : * what city and/or region has the best pizza ? 
  of taking people 's money and not obeying their treaties ? 
  orban is a joke . 
   hungary has done more to european stability in the last year alone than germany/sweden has . 
  fuck greece , right ? 
  france ( i 'm a francophile like most greeks ) or italy ( they 're the closest you can get to greeks ) . 
  maybe the uk or germany ( because of their history & culture ) but i do n't feel very close to them and i hate their weather . 
  plus , i ca n't wait for all the `` gim me my euromonies '' in the latter . 
  turns out that does n't make medieval slavs ancient . 
  who would have guessed ? 
  yes , it just happens to be over three millennia older than nay semblance of slavic culture . 
  medieval slavs are considered ancient now ?
