  then what the hell are our ancient myths & epics , super-duper-ultra-hyper-ancient ? 
   how does this work for greeks ? 
  do you feel your country 's history started at independence from the ottomans , or are the greek city states and the byzantine empire just as much part of ` greece 's ' history , with ` greece ' being defined as the current state for the greek nation ? 
  this more or less . 
  when talking about current affairs , we mainly look at our modern history ( what we call `` neo-hellenic history '' ) but we do not consider ancient and byzantine greece to be distinct nations and civilisations , we consider them to be older versions of our own . 
  while most northern & western europeans started having nationalism in the late 1800 's , greeks had had a concept of nationhood since ancient times and we had distinct nationalism since byzantine times ( certainly after the 4th crusade , especially in the empire of nicaea ) . 
  so regardless of whether they called themselves \u1f08\u03c7\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03af , \u0394\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bf\u03af , \u0393\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af , \u1f1d\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 or \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9 / \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03af they always considered themselves to be greeks descended from the older greeks . 
  for example , gemistus pletho and several byzantine emperors openly looked down on the latins for being `` barbarians '' as opposed to their own `` refined greek heritage '' ( pletho even wanted to change the name of the empire to the greek empire ) , theodoros kolokotrones and several other greek revolutionaries always told their soldiers that `` as greeks they should bow down to no one , not even gods '' and even in ancient times , homeric and classical greeks wrote epics about their mycenaean ancestors ' glorious feats . 
  i guess it 's because since we always had a very distinct language and ( many times ) religious tradition to our neighbors , it was easy to maintain a separate identity . 
   that 's a bit abstract so let me explain what i mean : being from the netherlands , my country 's history is quite a bit shorter than yours , and the furthest we can go back and still find a recognisably dutch culture is probably the 1400s . 
  however , culturally and in politics it 's possible to find references to the golden age of the 1600s , imperialism and a bit more , however , i think there 's a general feeling that currently relevant history did n't start until ww2 . 
  the dutch always confused me actually . 
  being a history nerd , i learned about their independence from the austrians but i never understood whether they identified as germans before they became independent . 
  still , i always picked you in age of empires iii xd, 
  yes , we 've all seen how great and democratic the eu is in dealing with brexit and the greek crisis . 
  we 've also seen how they 've enforced the migrant quotas on the eastern european states ( woops , they have n't ) . 
  ca n't wait to hand over my nation 's army to that bunch of anti-democratic , incompetent , megalomaniacal , elitist , france-germany dominated bunch of lunatics . 
   then you were at a bad school.the austro hungarian army was useless because it was outdated . 
  they lacked machine guns , they lacked heavy artillery , they lacked sufficient ammunition supplies , their officer corps was unflexible and they had a lack of ncos.the language barrier was a minimal problem and irrelevant in the grand picture . 
  read what the german military advisor to a-h said . 
  `` great hungary wants no refugees but wants all army protection by big eu . 
  the austro-hungarians tried it , had the various national units try to break off and then replaced them with mixed ones and had the absolutely worst army in existence until german military advisors came and split the multi-national units up . 
  then , these national units facilitated the breakup of the empire and nationalisms within it . 
  how about no ? 
   greece has a new currency , that ruined the lives of any greek citizen dumb enough to be fiscally responsible . 
  as a citizen who was fiscally responsible ( like my entire family ) i 'll be happy to inform you that my life has been ruined . 
   the european economy would be in shambles which would further depress the greek economy , no one would lend greece any money unless the conditions were nothing short of draconic and the fundamental problems that run through the greek economy from top to bottom remain unsolved so in a few years , greece is back to square 1 , ready to declare bankruptcy orrrr the germans see through it and go with debt forgiveness , as us intelligence estimated they would do ( without counting on papandreou to be a moron ) . 
   greece spent more than it made before paying any interest . 
  there is litteraly no way to get out of debt in that situation other than austerity , while cracking down on tax evasion in a big way . 
  really now ? 
  austerity helps an economy ? 
  blimey , we should be rocking right now !, 
  and do n't hit me with the `` hitting tax evasion '' crap . 
  how about the eu lenders stop supporting the very people who are greece 's biggest tax evaders ? 
  or how about they stop demanding businesses to pay 100 % of their taxes one year in advance , forcing them to go bankrupt or just tax evade . 
  edit : for those supporting austerity : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s31vlg8qi78, 
  you 're welcome . 
  thanks for being our best neighbour < 3, 
  so how are you grateful then ? 
  the question was very clear . 
  the meanings everyone attached to it were not . 
  'cause then you ca n't blame `` those lazy greeks '' as most german media did and absolve yourself of breaching a promise to voters to not bail out the banking sector again ? 
  you ai n't . 
   first , how one just walk away from the debt ? 
   forceful conversion of debts to drachma is not far from bankruptcy and refusal to pay the debts . 
  indeed , because that 's exactly what the author was proposing . 
   and third , drachma and it 's devaluation will hit the population hard . 
  people would switch to $ in their businesses , look at eastern europe in 1990s . 
  indeed , it would hit the people very hard . 
  almost as hard as austerity , but not for as long . 
  besides , it would also hit the rest of europe , so it 'd probably end with forgiveness ( which is what the us diplomatic cables show the us expected to almost certainly happen ) unless germany & co wanted to see the eu economy turn to shit . 
  but when you have morons/traitors like papandreou in charge , you ca n't even expect that basic level of diplomatic foresight . 
  masters of photoshop ... 
  i 'm fairly certain we do n't own the last two anymore ( for now ) . 
  well , because we have pooled all our resources in the mountainous area of athens , we have neglected to develop the fertile , river-full plains of northern and western greece , which could easily be industrialised . 
  basing all out economy of the services and smal lindustry sector of athens is a recipe for disaster . 
  people from the provinces often call greece the `` state of athens '' . 
  tbh ( even though i 'm athenian ) it 's true and it 's a pretty big reason of why our economy is so crappy . 
  we are of shitstate . 
   maybe its time to start viewing europe as having naturally different zones with different economic activity and that having that activity centered in one part is only natural . 
  how about no ? 
   so when you 're meeting a pontic speaker , you 'd be hearing the greek very similar ( or rather , even more similar , if i understood you correctly ) to what the byzantines would 've been speaking ? 
  more or less  though , keep in mind , late byzantine dialects are very similar to modern greek . 
  pontic was isolated , so it resembles what `` true '' byzantine greek was like before the 4th crusade and turkish invasions which led to a breakdown of byzantine public education ( that had standardised koine greek ) . 
   and to be able to read the sources directly !, 
  i 'm jealous haha , you have a very rich and ancient language !, 
  thank you !, 
  at least we have that going for us xd, 
  `` integrated '', 
   i should translate '' \u1f25\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 '' though . 
  it must come from \u03b5\u1f30\u03bc\u03af , but for the life of me i ca n't figure out the conjugation it 's in . 
  not really , they are n't related though it looks similar with various tenses of \u03b5\u1f30\u03bc\u03af . 
  \u1f25\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 is the female version of `` the one who/which ''  outof curiousity , are all greeks able to do what you just did - take modern greek , make some adjustments and turn it into ancient greek ? 
  and how well is the average greek able to read ancient and koine greek ? 
  most greeks who 've finished high school can do that . 
  ancient is kinda harder for us to read , but we can manage it . 
  greek is much closer to its linguistic ancestors than , say , italian is to latin ( thanks byzantium & orthodox church ) so we can get the gist of it . 
  the biggest change is in grammar simplification and accent . 
  koine is quite easy , as modern greek is basically simplified koine with loanwords . 
  some dialects ( like tsakonian , pontic , old athenian & maniot etc. ), 
  are much more archaic , so for them it 's much easier . 
  pontic , for example , is basically koine so to them classical is what koine is to the standard modern greek speakers . 
   well that 's interesting.to be honest in greece we never had any problems with the large turkish population who lives at the north part of the country , thrace ( they are not exactly `` immigrants '' , just people who decided to stay in greece after the greece-turkey population exchange ) . they have adapted pretty good throughout all those years . 
  lol nope they have n't . 
  there was an investigation about their mps giving classified data to the turkish consulate and the turkish consulate always organises visits for erdogan 's son there . 
  as if that was n't enough , they have multiple pro-union with tukrey ovements and they burned down community housing that we had built for them to help them integrate . 
  and that 's without counting how hostile they are to greeks . 
  i had a friend whose family lived there because he 's father 's a military officer and they treated them like an occupation force . 
  greece op plz nerf . 
  well more like : \u0112 kop\u00e9la pou p\u1e17re to teleuta\u00edo chrys\u00f3 \u00e9spase to rek\u00f3r gia t\u0113n kategor\u00eda t\u0113s . 
  close enough though . 
  after all , the greek i used was rather slangy . 
  maybe an ancient greek version would help ? 
  i spread it out a bit more and made it more archaic/official , so it should be closer to what you 've studied . 
  the girl who got the last gold broke the world record for her category . 
  tmw your country put no money into its olympic teams and you still manage to get 3 medals ( including a world record ) . 
   you greeks deserve to live in eternal misery 'cause you stink and you do n't give receipts for coffee . 
  / r/europe at the time, 
  surprise enosis !, 
  eu bots at their usual stupid level .
