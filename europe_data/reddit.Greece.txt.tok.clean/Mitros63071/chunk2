  you made generalisation about all of the balkans . 
  what does that make you ? 
  do n't get worked up on me fritz , calm down there . 
   krugmann is guy who need to fill a column every day , still has a more educated opinion than you . 
   varoufakis destroyed all shreds of credibility he might have once had with his little ( or not so little ) stunts - before he ran like a little girl . 
  what stunts ? 
  he was a perfectly competent and legit finance minister and a professor of economics at cambridge . 
  he did n't run , he refused to sign another suicidal deal . 
   besides : none of those are historians either . 
  so now you went from demanding an economist 's opinion on a financial matter to demanding a historian 's opinion . 
  those that survived , that is . 
   that were burned down ftfy http://www.defence-point.gr/news/?p=82662, 
  it 's on my bucket list to visit rome one day . 
  now i wan na go even more !, 
  ps : do you guys still serve [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/placenta_cake ) ? 
  half of byzantine/modern greek food is descended from this thingy , i wan na now what the original was like . 
  dude , you 're my favourite troll on this subreddit . 
  bless you , my good man . 
  at least what 's left of them ... 
  along with the church that got demolished in smyrna last year , which was one of the oldest in the world . 
   that 's exactly what happened though . 
  the debtor countries wrote off about half of that debt . 
  already forgotten ? 
  how surprising . 
  then proceded to loan us some more at an interest rate so high , the debt doubled once more , as part of the same deal no less !, 
  what relief !, 
   no one takes noam chomsky seriously . 
  besides - he is a fucking linguist , you moron . 
  he has exactly zero expertise . 
  quite a few people take chomsky seriously ; he is an intellectual . 
  speaking of expertise , for all i know , you have none either , yet you have no porblem with expressing an opinion . 
  how about some people who have expertise ? 
  do those names ring a bell ? 
  i would appreicate it if you did n't use profanity . 
  i did n't insult you , you should n't insult me . 
  unless of course the level of your arguements is so low , you need to strengthen them by using the f-bomb . 
   you may not like it , but it was , in fact , a debt relief . 
  debt relief is forgiving somebody 's loans or giving them financial aid without expecting anything in return . 
  a loan is a loan . 
   even more importantly ftfy so your arguement against a study is not evidence , but your own racist prejudice against the balkan peoples ? 
  lovely . 
  quite a few people outside the balkans take it seriously ; noam chomsky is an example . 
  could and should . 
  i believe those are too different news sources . 
  paid ? 
  the istanbul pogrom was less than half a century ago . 
  even today , turkey refuses to re-open christian theological schools in its largest city , which happen to be the oldest in the world . 
  turkey has still not apologised for these events , choosing to justify them instead . 
  yes , i would n't call that a very friendly nation . 
  that was not debt relief . 
  that was a new loan . 
  speaking of loans : http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/greek-study-provides-evidence-of-forced-loans-to-nazis-a-1024762.html that 's without counting the forced gold loan , with its lovely interest rate . 
  do n't worry we still love ya !, 
  as long you do n't try any crap in pindus again ... 
  [ freedom !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgqah3-lk54 ), 
  hey we get called broke , lazy and poor everywhere , we feel ya . 
  by the time they reach the channel , [ only serbs will be left ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-eqja8ahac ) . 
  because turkey is already hostile to christians . 
   they let migrants en masse flow in macedonia how do you propose we stop them ? 
  you also get a free trip to the hospital . 
  one commits , another commends ... the second is by far worse !, 
  dat logic . 
  oh do n't worry turkey took care of the christians a long time ago ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/istanbul_pogrom https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/assyrian_genocide https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_genocide https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian_genocide, 
   not debts from squandering billions for decades as opposed to slaughtering millions as germany did ? 
   slightly reduced war the largest debt relief in history was `` slightly reduced '' lmao, 
  you have the benefits of a free travel zone and the disadvantage of one . 
  do you even know the logistic capabilities it would take to deport such large numbers of people ? 
  where would those camps be ? 
  what work will unskilled immigrants do , in a europe plagued by recession and unemployemnt ? 
  erasing all of germany 's debts and giving them the know how and the materials to rebuild their country was quite a big thing . 
  not destroying their industry also was a major point . 
  no matter how small , without us aid germany would be another poland . 
  unless you 've been sleeping under a rock , italy is expecting a huge influx of refugees . 
  less are coming , but they 're still coming . 
  so your solution is what ? 
  oh fuck you guys , you just happen to have a sea border , who cares . 
  and what if they start coming into bulgaria , italy and albania with boats ? 
  how far north are you going to push that border ? 
  we have tried . 
  quite a lot . 
  read the official eu reports on the matter . 
  and since you 're an expert , what 's your solution ? 
  the fact that they keep coming months after the border closure proves that train of thought wrong . 
  and how would you secure our border exactly ? 
  'cause i hear a lot of disses but not many solutions . 
  so if it were n't for the marshal plan germany would have been rebuilt ? 
  lol, 
  the us recognised that the german debt , just like the current greek debt , is unpayble . 
  germany has quite a lot to earn , as evidenced by the fact that their banks were saved from the bailout and they 've made quite a lot from interest , too . 
  all that aside , you need to be forced to return the kindness someone showed to you ? 
  that says a lot about you ... 
  the fact that you say `` excuse '' shows that you know you ca n't get an actual reason . 
  [ when ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/london_agreement_on_german_external_debts ) ? 
  [ i really do wonder ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marshall_plan ), 
  yeah who cares about setting a precedent to ignore un resolutions on refugees ... how could that ever bite them back in the ass ? 
  also to all the `` omfg greece and italy grow a pair ! 1 !!! 1 ! one ! '', 
  people , does grow a pair mean drown unarmed people and give turkey an excuse to turn their casus belli into war ? 
  if so , i 'm fine with being a eunuch . 
  then again , i would n't expect lessons on bravery from people hiding behind walls and ignoring eu resolutions when it suits them while lecturing us on common eu financial policy .
