  an albanian friend once told me : `` an albanian without hands is the only albanian you can trust . '', 
   stop blaming others because our politicians are a bunch of fuckers elected by our parents and our grandparents ( and by us ! ), 
  who always wanted to be public servants to do nothing and get paid a lot with money that did n't belong to us because we did n't bother to even pay taxes , ever . 
  nobody mentioned anything even remotely related to this . 
  also , while the majority of the blame is with us , others are to blame too ( * cough * siemens * cough * ) . 
  israel gives its arab citizens normal rights . 
  it is due to the arabs ' tendencies for terrorist attacks , that certain rules of segregation have to be enforced . 
  so to you the choice was either ultra-left or ultra-right ? 
  oh , ok that makes more sense . 
  the title is slightly misleading then . 
  yep . 
  you 'd be surprised how many people only support them because of stuff like this . 
  dobro . 
  yogurt . 
  plodviv . 
  ( am i doing this right ? ), 
  what the heck are russian planes doing in bulgaria ???????? 
  why would they even go there ? 
  i 'm greece now ? 
  yay !, 
  lol while syriza is a perfect champion of our working class ... 
  if only we 'd get a serious right wing party ... 
   well to be fair the nazis where rumored to have risen so much in germany because they fed people for free at the height of the weimar germany depression golden dawn actually does that a lot in greece . 
  police try to stop them instead of getting the people in question some food , gaining them more popularity . 
  israel has a common-sense approach to most things that we would do well to emulate . 
  what the f * ck , slovakia ? 
   with quite international interests lol  but eu is still what makes europe a strong unity . 
  as the economic crisis and refugee crisis have proven , oh wait . 
  techincally it means `` having come [ here ] , [ come and ] get [ them ] ! '', 
  got ta love how greek mashes seven words into two . 
   if a socialist uprising occurred in the us lol, 
  and give the eight innocent officers asylum . 
  greek has very long sentences , which translate into even longer sentences in foreign languages , which is why it 's so hard to translate . 
  spain looks like it had a malignant tumour removed . 
  edit : sorry catalans , i was n't thinking straight when i wrote this . 
  edit ii : wtf is wrong with corsica and sardinia ? 
  edit iii : are the balkans obese , or what ? 
  edit iv : rip denmark , thanks for the stories and lego . 
  our men are running from the battrefierd !!, 
  shamefur dispray !!, 
  ** translation : **  turkey 's government is scaling up the pressure it is putting on athens , with regard to the eight turkish officers who fled to alexandroupolis in a helictoper and applied for political asylum , the day after the failed coup attempt in their country . 
  following the ambassador of turkey in athens , kerim uras , the batton was relayed to ( greek expression meaning the efforts were taken over by ) the minister of foreign affairs himself , melvut cavusoglu , for him to ask for the extradition of the eight officers , who are accused of taking part in an attempt to overthrow the elected government . 
   `` the coup perpetrators are asking for political asylum . 
  political asylum is out of the question for the perpetrators of a coup , '' the chief of turkish diplomacy stated , during an interview in turkey 's central state network , trt , to add : `` that which we expect from the greek authorities is to cooperate ( with turkey ) and to surrender those traitors to us . '', 
   the turkish minister of foreign affairs did not mention , during the aforementioned inteview , the complications which the mention of the reinstatement of the death penalty by the president of the country , teyip erdogan , caused to the the turkish request for the extradition of the eight officers , as did the suspension of the european human rights agreement within the framework of a declaration of a state of emergency , which was decided by the turkish government . 
   last tuesday , the ambassador of turkey in greece , kerim uras , has caused concern in athens when , in the course of an emergency press conference , he had warned with a strict temperament that a possible non-extradition of the eight turkish officers would `` not at all help '' the relations between the two neighbouring countries . 
  in the same press conference , mr. uras had called the fact that greek authorities allowed the landing of the turkish military helicopter in greece a `` mistake . '', 
  following the reactions that his statement caused , mr. uras spoke of a misinterpretation of his words , claiming that the ambassador has concern for stability and amelioration of bilateral relations as his duty . 
   ** message to the usa **  in the same interview , last night , melvut cavusoglu also touched upon the subject of the extradition of fetulah gulen from the usa , stressing that ankara awaits `` tangible results '' from washington d.c. turkey has submitted a formal extradition reuquest for gulen , whom she accuses of being the mastermind behind the failed coup and has submitted to the american department of justice the supporting material in question . 
  american vice president joe biden reassured , during a phone call , the turkish prime minister binali yidirlim that the turkish request will be studied in detail , as fast as possible . 
  dayum , now that 's variety . 
  a silly question , but what 's the difference between the catalan flag with the star and the one without it ? 
  yeah , i mean mighty orban himself asked you to stay and the poles projected your flag ( upside down as a sign of distress , not by mistake obviously ) on a well known building ( whose name neither i nor my half-polish friend can recall for some magical reason ) and you do not throw all the socio-economic arguements for brexit out of the window ? 
  how dare you , uk ? 
  a laconic remark , indeed . 
   villages were torched . 
  roman catholic priests were axed or crucified . 
  churches were burned with all their parishioners . 
  isolated farms were attacked by gangs carrying pitchforks and kitchen knives . 
  throats were cut . 
  pregnant women were bayoneted . 
  children were cut in two . 
  sounds an awful lot like distomo or oradour-sur-glane to me . 
   so it was merely internationally sanctioned ethnic cleansing ? 
  no governemnt intentionally tried to kill germans . 
  unlike the holocaust . 
  besides , even if i do not justify it , if the germans did not want `` ethnic cleansing '' maybe they should n't have started wwii . 
  nobody could trust them with minorities in poland , czechia etc. 
  after that . 
  and this is from somebody whose ancestors lived through an actual genocide . 
  we ca n't even deal with the refugee crisis together , now we want an army ? 
  screw that , i hope we veto it . 
  integration is doing its magic !, 
  soon we 'll have reverse-janissaries !, 
  frappe is love , frappe is life . 
  lol that 's a lovey coa . 
  if by we , you mean leaders of old clans that hads lots to lose from his reforms and suffrage of the peasant classes , at the incitation of britain and france who did not like his independent/pro-russia policies , then yes . 
  from the italian/venetian name of the city of koper in slovenia , from where his family had old origins before moving to corfu a few generations before his birth . 
  fun fact : the city itself was named after the greek word for goat , being an ancient greek colony . 
  do n't worry , we will be , we do n't have any problems with you guys . 
  you 're moderate and you do n't cause many problems . 
  it 's just that i do n't know how many more we can handle . 
  and there 's also the issue of pro-erdogan nationalists in thrace clashing with anti-erdogan refugees . 
  * kapodistrias his family had origins from the slovenian city ( fun fact , founded as an ancient greek colony named after the greek word for goat ) of koper/capodistria , so when they came to corfu some generations before he was born they turned the italian version of the city 's name into a greek last name . 
  coming from a country that shot itself in the foot , i know how you feel . 
  but to be honest , deep down , we all know when we 're making bad choices . 
  we just like to take the easy route and pretend it 'll be alright . 
  is n't our coffee the same ? 
   historically , this is not something that greece has been able to achieve . 
  historically , the us did n't have any sort of public insurance before obamacare . 
   and how is this not austerity ? 
  almost no country in the world runs a balanced budget . 
  austerity in the sense imposed by the eu is very high taxes with slashes to the parts of the public buedget that help the general public , while protecting the interests of the upper classes to keep the pro-eu voter base solid . 
   there are no metrics where iceland has a better quality of life than the us . 
  median income , gdp per capita ppp , nor inequality-adjusted hdi . 
  iceland has a better income distributio nthan your , therefore their average citizen earns more than the average us citizen . 
  the usa 's gdp per capita is brought up by billionaires who avoid taxes . 
  as for hdi ... 
  i 'm fairly certain that their free healthcare and welfare would like a word with you . 
  if you look at their trends , all of their metrics are either stable or rising .
