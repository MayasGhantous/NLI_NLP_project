  i have nothing to celebrate . 
  the suicide rate in greece has spiked since the memoranda were introduced . 
  as has the rate of young greeks moving abroad .

  translation :  ankara threatened athens , in a diplomatic manner , concerning the eight turkish officers who requested asylum in greece after the failed coup . 
   the turkish ambassador in athens , kerim uras , said that a possible non-extradition of the turkish officers from greece will not help the bilateral relations of the two countries . 
   he also stated his belief that the greek government should have not allowed the turkish helicopter to land on greek soil and that if there - really - was a mechanical failure , it could have landed anywhere in turkey . 
   `` permission to land should not have been granted as the helicopter was not faced with a fire issue as it had mentioned while broadcasting a distress signal , while it was known that there was a coup attempt in turkey and those fleeing took part in it , '' he said . 
   it should be noted , in any case , that greece had no choice , since the helicopter had declared `` mayday . '', 
   the ambassador made the promise that the eight will have a fair and transparent trial in turkey and he added that `` this case must be closed very quickly . 
   according to the eight , however , and as their greek attorneys have stated , they fear for their lives and do not wish to be extradited to turkey . 
   * the turkish ambassador is pictured *  ** `` the eight took part in the plot to assasinate erdogan '' **  the pro-government turkish paper `` star '' published an extremely incriminatory report for the eight turkish officers who have sought political asylim in greece , claiming that the group in question was part of a plot to assasinate erdogan . 
   according to information which is published in turkey , a team of 40 commandos went to marmaris , were the turkish president was vacationing , with the mission to inflict deadly harm upon him . 
   the presidential guard drove back the attack and a battle around the hotel where erdogan was staying ensued , with him managing to escape in time . 
   according to `` star 's '' report , following their failed attempt to kill erdogan , the commandos fled in various directions . 
   some of them went to a nato base aboard two helicopters , while eight of them landed in a third helicopter in alexandroupolis . 
   some others seem to have abandoned their armament and fled to the mountains . 
   it is worth mentioning that the information in question , given that it comes from pro-erdogan press , is being checked to verify its authenticity and it not unlikely for it to be a way of pressuring greece into extraditing the eight . 
   it is noted that the eight themselves claim to have been in a helicotper which was transporting wounded men to constantinople ( istanbul ) and after taking fire they decided to head to alexandroupolis , seeking political asylum . 
  i wonder how many suicides and immigrants this one cost us ... 
  seriously , when are these people going to realise that if we keep shrinking the gdp , we 'll only need more loans and more austerity with them ? 
  wake up , things are n't getting better , only worse . 
  just because we sold and slashed enough to claim to have a `` surplus '' does n't mean our state is actually running properly . 
  it 's like cutting your foot off and saying you have a foot to spare . 
  edit : apparently some people need an eli5 for everything .

  `` oh yes , the nazis . 
  nice people , as long as you did n't mention jews . '', 
   they ca n't defend themselves that 's rather funny coming from an austrian of all people ... 
  i 'm pretty sure his shit in smyrna makes erdogan look like a pussy , when it comes to prosecuting christians . 
  it 's not as if they really care for the debt to be paid anytime soon . 
  there 's lots of infrastructure and young skilled workers for the taking . 
  closing down southern european competition is also a good bonus . 
  and plus , who does n't want the chance of telling their public that any financial problems and tax hikes are the result of those lazy greeks ? 
  yes let 's stick to ruining what 's left of our economy and society in exchange for some more extend and pretend , so we can all pretend that there 's a possibiltiy of paying our massive debt with a falling gdp . 
  `` reforms '' ... `` relief '' ...

  translation :  new riots took place on the island of leros , having been caused by migrants , in which a group of locals took part , causing a strained atmosphere to reign over the island . 
   in the morning of saturday , specifically , about 200 migrants , who are being housed in the hotspot of lepides , executed a mass exodus and started moving towards lakki . 
   shortly thereafter , a crowd of migrants had gathered in a central spot of the city . 
  the mayor and the city councilors arrived at the spot at the same time , to learn precisely what was going on . 
   after a many-hour-long negotiation of the municipal authority with the leaders of the migrants , the chief of the ngo which was accompanying the migrants and the representative of the un high commission for refugees , the municipal authority was informed that the migrants in question fear for their lives . 
   as the migrants were saying , there are many deliquents in the hotspot of lepides , which threaten them , resulting in them being unable to peacefully coexist in the facilites of the first reception centre . 
   the mayor and the city councilors advised the chiefs of the ngos and the high commission to explain to the refugees that there no other facilities/resources on the island for their accommodation and that they must return to the first reception centre where any problems they might have will be cared for . 
   however , the migrants were intransigent concerning the possibility of their return to the hotspot and thus the mayor contacted the police so that they may mediate in the dispute so that a solution might be found , given that many locals had begun expressing their disapproval of the situation which had overtaken the city of lakki . 
   thus , an hour later the units for the restoration of order ( riot police ) arrived , with the police director moving towards the migrants so as to explain the situation which had come to be . 
   sadly , before he could even explain the situation to the migrants , the police director was assaulted by a group of immigrants , resulting in many residents of the island becoming involved in the fight . 
  the riot policemen managed to restore order and the migrants were then led to the facilities of lepides . 
   it should be noted that the residents of leros verbally assaulted citizens who showed solidarity with the migrants , ngos as well as members of the unhcr 's mission , blaming them for the situation which reigns over the island in the last few days . 
  according to information , several ngo members have already begun leaving the island , while there is also information relating to a departure of the unhcr 's mission in the immediate future . 
  true . 
  but treating them humanely once they 've actually come is a rare thing . 
  * cough * greece * cough * * cough * portugal * cough * * cough * southern italy * cough * you were saying ? 
   we 're worried that our european partners will increasingly cooperate on the eu level well , not britain xd  sweden and finland are our neighbors and they 're not in nato . 
  good for them , nato 's useless for many countries anyway . 
   the nordic battlegroup ( nbg ) is one of eighteen european union battlegroups . 
  it consists of around 2,500 soldiers including officers , with manpower contributed from the seven participating countries ( sweden , finland , norway , ireland , estonia , latvia and lithuania ) . 
  why the heck would you join an eu battlegroup ? 
  switzerland and iceland have n't done that . 
   what ? 
  you do n't like turkic peoples ? 
  that 's very `` surprising '' , i wonder why ? 
   i 've got no problem with them , they 're culture is n't european is all . 
   hehe , if you think the eea is anything other than the eu-without-rights-and-all-the-laws , you 're wrong :( to quote the brits : `` pay !, 
  no say ! '', 
  well you do n't have to militarily defend eu members , impose sanctions on those they impose sanctions upon etc. 
  so i 'd say it 's quite different   heck , you forgot about azerbaijan !, 
  :d azerbaijan is considered european ? 
  they 're more turkic so i would n't really count them in , 
   i knew you would fail on this account !, 
   you should have remembered that we 're in the eea . 
  we pay handsomely for that privilege and the uk might go this way . 
  norway is part of efta , which includes iceland and switzerland by the way ... eea = / = eu . 
  you 're the one who failed   p.s. 
  you left out kosovo and armenia , i mean they matter , right ? 
  / s my bad about armenia . 
  kosovo 's statehood is illegitimate so i do n't include them . 
  norway ?
