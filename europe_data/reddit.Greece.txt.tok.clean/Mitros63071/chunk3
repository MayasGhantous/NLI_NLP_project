  aside from overly baddass keyboard warrior statements , how do you expect this will solve the migrant crisis ? 
  how ` bout that funding we had been asking for before the whole crisis even begun ? 
  grow a pair , get invaded by turkey and/or drown unarmed people ? 
  i would call that suicide , not growing a pair . 
  if you want it so badly , you 're welcome to come down here and do it yourself . 
  you 're using logic , that 's not fair . 
  ** 1299 ** - following a revolt from cretan aristocracy , led by alexios callerges , the venetians grant several priviledges to the local nobles . 
  ** 1897 ** - greek troops withdraw from crete . 
  in return , the ottoman empire transforms crete into an autonomous principality , with the greek crown prince as its head of state and the future greek pm eleutherios venizelos as its prime minister . 
  title error , they were actually 39 . 
   turkish aircraft formations violated greece 's national airspace ** 39 times ** , in various parts of the aegean , while greek and turkish fighters engaged in simulated dogfights during interception . 
  ** a pair of turkish f-16 flew over rho ** at 27.500 feet . 
   ** 3 turkish fighter squadrons ** entered the athens fir without submitting flight plans - two were pairs and one was comprised of six planes - 4 turkish naval cooperation aircraft and 9 helicopters . 
   18 violations of the athens fir 's air travel rules were recorded and 39 violations of the national airspace in the northeast , central and southeast aegean were recorded . 
   in all cases the turkish aircraft were designated and intercepted by equivalent greek fighters , while in ** 7 cases iconic dogfights ** occured between the two . 
   ** six turkish aircraft were armed . 
  if italy does turn out to be nearly as competent and advanced as the roman republic ( or at least machiavelli 's florence ) please , do consider annexing us . 
  after all , it was under the romans that greece experienced unparalleled prosperity after decades of war . 
  us be like : `` we should have never erased those gerries ' debts and rebuilt their damn country !, 
  we should have invested in france and let them starve instead ! '', 
  yeah your money ... 
   donaldos trympocles , \u0392\u0399\u03a3\u03a4 ' !, 
  ftfy, 
  wow what 's with all the angry comments ppl ; i 'm an athenian from an athenian family ( ie . 
  they did n't come to the capital from the provinces ) and i recognise that most of modern athens in ugly , like any major southern european city . 
  we could have made it better and we could make it better . 
  stop attacking the poor dude and talking shit about rome , yes it 's the same , but just 'cause the capital of the dude 's country is as bad as ours , does n't take truth away from what he said . 
  maybe we should take it into consideration and once , if ever , we get out of our current mess we could try to make athens ( this phrase has been ruined completely but i ca n't say it in any other way ) great again !, 
  it was great up until 1970 and it can be great again , even greater perhaps !, 
  international law ? 
  mighty rossiya laughs at such stupid concepts !, 
  [ 1788 called , the ancien r\u00e9gime wants its politics back . 
  indeed . 
  but two wrongs do n't make a right . 
  you do n't have to go to either extreme to fix anything . 
  you just need sanity . 
  i believe the 92 % refers to greek nationals . 
  until very recently , the only way to get greek nationality is if you had a greek parent . 
  jesus christ are you people blind ? 
  i said i 'm against mass migration , but electing anti-abortion numbnuts is not the way to solve it ... jesus . 
  as plato said , all men are worthy of those who lead them . 
  i do think so . 
  what i do n't understand , is all the downvotes and ridiculous assumptions , for stating something which is well known . 
  the whole point of a hyperbole is taking a statement ( or a train of thought , in this case ) to an extreme , so as to show how ridiculous it is . 
  if you take it literally , you must seriously go back to school . 
   the only progressive democracy in the middle east which may or may have not been involved in war crimes less than a year ago ... and which also happens to shit on human rights . 
  lebanon could have earned that label , tunisia too . 
  if you honestly thinks a party which commends fn 's policies is not regressive , [ how ` bout a party whose first elected official commended the thrid reich as `` economically efficient '' and is completely inconsistent with traditional classical european liberalism ? 
  ] ( http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/at-political-parties-fpo.htm ) what if i told you the party in question [ supported sadam freaking hussein ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_party_of_austria#cite_note-87 ) the party is in league with putin 's united russia and the serbian progressive party . 
  if that 's not proof enough for you , there 's no point in trying to convince you . 
  i most certainly do . 
  did i ever say otherwise ? 
  hopefully . 
  maybe the austrians will take one for the team ? 
  i never distanced myself from anything . 
  you accused me of making a statement which i did not make . 
  we 're talking about a party that 's meeting with tea party leadership and commends israeli foreign policy . 
  a party that 's in league with the fn . 
  they are n't just right wing . 
  they 're far beyond that . 
  you 're free to be in denial about it , but do n't waste my time with strawmen . 
  what cliches did i precisely mention ? 
   you ca n't undue unchecked migration i believe you meant undo . 
  and on what most reliable data is that estimate based ? 
  not all european countries are faced with the same problems . 
  greece , for example , is 92 % ethnically white , christian , greek . 
  we do n't need the extreme measures for any racial issues . 
  even for those countries who do need it , a large part of their workforce is unskilled migrant labour . 
  if they go , what do you think will happen to the countries ' economies , economies which were built around unchecked migration for decades ? 
  my point is , you have to solve the issue , but not with a jerknee overnight response ; you need long term , coordinated solutions , like migrant quotas , slow deportations , incentives to grow local populations etc. 
  far right populists rarely , if ever , have the brains for such solutions . 
  all hail the flying spaghetti monster !, 
  may his tomato sauce guide us to salvation !, 
  well , if you honestly think you 're better off being ruled by strongmen and kings in all but name , you did n't deserve democracy to begin with . 
  somebody who bases their election platform on merely dissing the establishment and telling people what they want to hear , without offering any real solutions , is , by definition , a demagogue . 
  i never said fpo will send austria back to the middle ages . 
  i was talking about the new-right in general and in a hyperbolic manner , none the less . 
  how about you drop that ironic tone and leave the strawman alone ? 
  from what i 've heard it 's originally from aristotle , but that 's none of our concern . 
  anyway , i think we 're in agreement . 
  have a nice day :d, 
  turkey is a nation built on blood , but all nations are built on blood . 
  the difference is that some of us recognise it and move on , while others do n't . 
  i just hope for turkey 's sake that they do the former . 
  to be honest your own country is the only thing we have close to an actual democracy , at least in the classical sense . 
  what we have right now are aristotelian republics . 
  it might certainly be effective in giving short term solutions and getting the demagogue in question popularity , but it creates far greater , long term problems both for the country the demagogue rules and those it influences . 
  austria has a very educated and cultivated population ; they are perfectly capable of having an actual democracy . 
  if they choose otherwise , they only confirm what aristotle said : `` those who choose safety over liberty , deserve neither . '', 
  new-right be like : `` we do n't want those women hating , anti-abortion , anti-democratic savages in our countries !, 
  so we 'll elect people who 'll kick them out and then send our societies back to the middle ages ourselves ! '', 
  i 'm not in favour of unchecked migration . 
  i also do n't like the fact that only the far right wants to deal with that problem . 
  but if you honestly think electing a bunch of demagogues because they deal with one issue that nobody else dares to touch , when they have absolutely horrible opinions for a plethora of other issues , is a good choice , democracy is doomed . 
  and this is n't just for austria ; this is for all of us . 
  so destroying our values in order to prevent them from coming here is your solution ? 
  what 's effective about it ? 
  populism is doing what the majority wants regardless of whether it 's the best choice . 
  it killed athenian democracy and it 's bound to kill any democracy that degenerates into it .
