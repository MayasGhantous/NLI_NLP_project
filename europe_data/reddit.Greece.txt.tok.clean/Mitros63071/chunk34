  moving on to roman law , our modern roman law is based on byzantine law and even then it is vastly different from both . 
  and that 's without taking the uk 's common law into consideration . 
  for countries east of the rhine and north of the alps , they have little to no roman heritage and any `` heritage '' they mave is mainly artifical , due to the rennaissance , rather than the `` natural/true '' heritage of the romantic and southern european countries . 
  and that 's without taking into consideration the fact that americans are willing to help other states even if it means `` wasting '' money to develop them , while we europeans only look out for own own interests . 
  just look at how we handled ukraine , the refugee crisis and the eurozone crisis . 
  the eu is a ship built for good weather only ; the moment it hits a storm it starts to collapse and we 've got more than a few at the same time . 
  and what is correct then ? 
  how about we all go around ignoring international law and see how fast the world gets nuked . 
  we each have our own morality , which is why there can be no ultimate morality , lest you wish to return to the dark ages . 
  the law is superior to all moralities , as it a common denominator for all of us , and since international law is superior to all law , it is the supreme common denominator which we should always obey . 
  we might not like it ( i personally do n't want more refugees in europe ) but until the law changes , it should be obeyed . 
  i 'm still aking , what do you mean `` abuse of the greek language '' ? 
   abuse of the greek language how is that even related ? 
  besides the fact that turning nouns into verbs and making spelling mistakes is not the same thing , what abuse of greek language are you talking about and how are my posts related to that ? 
  current state of greek what ? 
  my posts are testament to what ? 
  also , tu quorque is n't considered an actual form of arguement ... 
  sorry for obeying international law . 
   genociding the verb * to genocide * must be a rather new addition to the english language , for i have n't seen it ever before . 
  nobody claimed that you are performing ethnic cleansing , leave that poor strawman alone . 
   we are in civil war with them so , what do they call [ one part of a country 's nationals fighting another part over ethnic and/or political disputes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurdish%e2%80%93turkish_conflict_%281978%e2%80%93present%29 ) where you 're from ? 
  would you prefer the term `` kurdish war of independence ? '', 
  then again , you are from the sort of country were a genocide of 1.5 million people is an act of `` self-defence , '' so i 'm assuming they 're just as creative in their terminology for civil wars . 
  let me guess ... `` policing operation ? '', 
   germany recognises its own responsibility for not stopping the armenian genocide and apologises for it . 
  german military advisors had a major hand in the ottomans ' decision to perform genocide on local greeks and armenians , as they were deemed dangerous for internal security , a living excuse for graeco-armenian irredentism and they also controled huge wealth which the ottomans wanted under their control . 
  it 's no secret that in the late 19th and early 20th century the ottomans ' military and state were reformed ( and in some cases run ) with the help of ( or by ) german advisors . 
  they still lost to the french-modelled greeks and serbs and german-modelled bulgarians , but that 's another story . 
  it is n't an actual word . 
  there 's also marseille which used to be our colony ( massalia ) . 
  i 've heard there 's a lot of antiquities there . 
  people over here always say that our modern state is a really bad copy of france . 
  it 's scary seeing france become more like our shithole though - . -, 
  well congrats 'cause the word you used is n't in the oxford dictionary . 
  get over it . 
  stephen colbert is far from an authority on the english language . 
  truthfulness is the word you 're looking for or semblance thereof . 
   an announcement regarding the tomb of aristotle in ancient stageira in northern greece was expected to be the highlight at an international conference held in thessaloniki on thursday . 
  international delegates attending the `` aristotle 2400 years '' world congress on thursday were expected to hear that archaeologists carrying out a 20-year excavation at the ancient macedonian city believe the site 's most important finding to be the greek philosopher 's tomb . 
  aristotle , who was born in the same city in 384 bc , died in evia in 322 bc . 
  the conference is organized by the interdisciplinary center for aristotle studies of the aristotle university of thessaloniki . 
  where exactly did you pull that quote from ? 
  this is the english version posted by / u/yannisneos  we can not be certain nor prove this was aristotle 's tomb . 
  which runs counter the categoric enouncement in the title . 
  i merely translated the title of the greek article . 
  it 's not my own . 
  use you aristotelian logic for that . 
  slaves were n't used for the parthenon , they were considered unworthy of climbing to the acropolis . 
  it was built by athenian citizens . 
  the same goes for a lot of great temples of antiquity . 
  the way the athenians got the money for it though ... good old imperialism . 
  it looks legit . 
  can we get an interior image ? 
  truthiness ? 
  well i dunno about that article , but your english seems so leggit you should do a translation yourself . 
  also why do you get offended when i call you a troll , when your username is trolls_brigade ? 
  this . 
  each greek city ( polis ) is made up of several demoi . 
  it 's been like that since ancient times and it will be for quite a while now . 
  so if you ask a `` suburban '' athenian what his municipality is , he 'll say ( for example ) amarousion , but if you ask him where he 's from in greece he 'll say athens . 
  people from \u0391\u03b8\u03ae\u03bd\u03b1 ( the city proper with the parthenon etc ) will say `` kentro '' , meaning `` centre '' ( ie . 
  athens proper ) , when asked for which part of athens . 
  even then there 's various areas like plaka and so on . 
  ps : amarousion is more representative of northern athens than kifisia , but it 's not really a suburb since it 's so highly urbanised . 
  kifisia is closer to the traditional definition , though it 's very upper class , so it 's not representative of most athenians ' environment . 
  seeing how many young people here are into tagging that wo n't be a problem . 
  and we have a reputation for carving writing too , so we 'll be fine . 
  same with us and the orthodorcs . 
  :( we just recently managed to get some marriage and rights bills for the lgbt through parliament and we 're still not secular . 
  all hail georgia !, 
  you have a cool name for us !, 
  we 're actually rebuilding the parthenon and many other monuments . 
  however , to stay true to their history , we 're making them using the same techniques that were used for the originals , with the help of volunteers ( mainly uni students ) . 
  the recession kinda does n't leave much money for that though , which is why it goes so slowly , too . 
  he literally made all members of the pythagorean academy commit suicide . 
  he walked in one day and was like : `` you guys worship numbers as gods ? '', 
  `` yeah . '', 
  `` gods are perfect . '', 
  `` yep , so are numbers . '', 
  `` what 's the hypotenuse of a triangle with perpendicular sides 3 and 2 ? '', 
  ( they did n't have square roots back then ) '' ... '' `` it has to be a perfect number , no ? '', 
  * everyone kills themselves * he literally went `` where 's your god now ? '', 
  on their ass . 
  he was also kind of a misogynist , classist , racist , greek supremacist douche , but hey he was a as hell and people were politically `` incorrect '' as fuck back then . 
  we brought europe the rennaissance and metal . 
  can we into debt forgiveness now ? 
  those guys actually performed next to sabaton in athens . 
  luxtos is my fav . 
  just like their ancestors ages ago !, 
  btw they translate into `` come , o lord '' and `` of death '' . 
  evzon guards for the kings of the nordic countries ?

  lol dude you 're in denial . 
  for the same reason we have n't done anything to fix our economy and we have n't expanded our territorial waters even though int . 
  law allows it and we have n't sued turkey for breaching the treaty of lausagne : our governments since the fall of the junta ( the colonels were n't democratically elected , so they were n't really `` ours '' ) have been incompetent as hell . 
  they are loans as per a paper signed by hitler himself , in his capacity as head of state . 
  also , the sum was paid in literal gold . 
  so greece could sue germany for the debt 's payments . 
  i am . 
  they are not `` so called '' germany literally force loaned all of our gold at 5 % per annum .
