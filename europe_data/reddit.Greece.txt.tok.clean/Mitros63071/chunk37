  we did n't . 
  hence they were wrong . 
  the cia assumed papandreou would act like any reasonable , sane man would . 
  he did not . 
  hence he was either an idiot or a traitor . 
  yeah , please tell me more about how we voluntarily chose bad measures when we could have enforced your perfect policy . 
  how is cutting your source of income fixing your budget ? 
  and while we 're on the matter , how come defence purchases from germant and france have n't been touched ? 
  how would he use the referendum to blackmail the eu genius ? 
  so the ecb illegally cutting support to our banks during the referendum was not blackmail , eh ? 
   it 's not about increasing taxes and slashing social budget . 
  read the memorandum , that 's exactly what it 's about . 
  euphemisms do n't make the policies any less insane . 
   small countries ftw . 
  small * rich * countries . 
   he did not cater to the masses . 
  so increasing wages right after elections was not catering to the masses ? 
  he did not try to properly reform the nation , he did practically nothing without foreign consent . 
   and what you read in wikileaks says more about american intelligence idiocy than it does about papandreou . 
  'cause the cia is idiotic compared to the genius of you or papandreou . 
  indeed . 
  but those reforms are n't in no way related to the `` reforms '' the momoranda are currently enforcing . 
  obviously . 
  nokia stopped making phones ? 
  when did that happen ? 
  and that makes them less christian how ? 
   remove the hurt from your butt chill out mate , why would i have butthurt ? 
  it 's not like we 're discussing anything related to me xd  of course they would jump ship with what was on offer would n't you ? 
  ( honest question )  sud tirol was and still is very much austrians or you think they were fighting it the whole time including resorting to terrorist/rebel activity in the 60 's for fun ? 
  i was reffering to istria , actually . 
  well that 's another matter entirely , i do feel for you guys as the allies sort of just waltzed in uninvited during the war even though you guys were n't even involved . 
  you get used to it when you 're a small country xd, 
   seizured they what now ? 
   italy finally introduced civil unions wow , we beat italy to civil rights for once ? 
  by a few motnhs , but still , this is akward . 
  the italians turned coats 'cause the germans treated them like shit , while the allies offered them land which you possessed with lots of italians in it . 
  besides , you do n't mean to tell me austria has been perfectly honourable with such a long history of imperialism , do you ? 
  furthermore , them being turncoats is n't a justifiable reason for your military defeat . 
  by that logic , greece did nothign wrong in the greco-turkish war of 1922 , we just lost 'cause the entente betrayed us . 
  welcome to the grown-up world . 
  i fully agree . 
  however , if we had defaulted in 2008 we would have severly damaged the european banking system . 
  no way germany , or anyone else for that matter , would have allowed this . 
  us diplomatic cables at the time , leaked through wikileaks , considered obvious that we would blackmail the germans into erasing our debt ... but papandreou , being the traitor or the imbecile that he was , did not . 
   she clearly had a communist upbringing ... with a priest father none the less !, 
  `` needed '' would not be the word i would use ... 
  i love how germans always go on about `` reforms '' as if adding more taxes while slashing all social budget and selling everything off really cheap to german companies will somehow magically help the economy heal ... that 's not reforms , that 's milking a corpse . 
  try not to lose a world war next time :p, 
  hell is too kind a word for our lot . 
  bitch please . 
  look at greece . 
   banter lol, 
  [ i know how that feels ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fourth_crusade ), 
  hold up , the regressives are working on that . 
  pretty soon the us is gon na be the biggest p.c. 
  shitfest in human history . 
  check their universities for a taste !, 
  romanian people i 've met everywhere always seem to do that . 
  no offense to romanians , you 're all pretty legit people , but if it 's so awesome , why is it so deep under ? 
   '' [ ... ] we are a sovereign country ! '', 
  that seem to be all venezuela 's leaders ever say . 
  saudi arabia is also a sovereign country . 
  is international law and respect for basic human dignity limited to colonies and occupation zones ?

  the propontis dried up ? 
  we 're all doomed !, 
  you can see how civilised a country is by how close their name for greece is to \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2 !, 
  / s seriously though , happy birthday norway !, 
  back when the european dream was still alive and propped up by tons of us cash !, 
  which is ( out of curiosity ) ? 
  seize property from where ? 
  it means margaret ( as in , the flower ) . 
  [ nah , not really . 
  holy shit my good man . 
  that 's a full journalist report you did there . 
  who the hell gets paid eur 1000 in greece these days ? 
  eur 600-700 more like . 
  should be a map of medians instead . 
  we should do that all over europe ... just sayin ' in the long run , it 's cheaper than having to integrate all those immigrats . 
  i 'm fully in support , and no it does n't have to do with me being a `` german hating greek '' . 
  when companies breach laws like that to get an unfair advantage , at the expense of the environment , they should be punished and severly so . 
  if anything , the eu should have taken action against vw by now . 
  both kinda correct . 
  athena was the goddess of warfare , science , wisdom and various other things ( ship-building one of them ) . 
  the owl , the most common nocturnal bird in attica , symbolises wisdom and strategy , two of athena 's traits , as well as attica itself . 
  the design is from an athenian 4 drachmae coin ( tetradrachmon in greek ) . 
  no shit , sherlock . 
   who gives a shit about that ? 
  it is not all about winning that 's the attitude a loser has !, 
  jk , keep being awesome, 
  greeks watch it ? 
  mate i 'm greek and i ca n't think of anyone who watches it . 
  concita wurst ( hope i spelled it right ) . 
  * sees veneto flag * completely unrelated but i can finally post [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybevc-yztvu ) somewhere, 
  i absolutely hate it . 
  it 's a waste of time and money . 
  i mean , we always claim to be so much more cultured than the states and we put on a freakshow like this ...
