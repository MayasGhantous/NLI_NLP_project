  coinception !, 
  true dat . 
  pizza and pasta master race !, 
   the greek coins are absolutely awesome in my opinion :d probably the best design by far . 
  well , at least the money we do n't have looks good xd, 
  civilisation motherfvckers , do you speak it ? 
  the only kind of war they can win . 
  good lord . 
  and i thought our church 's version of the byzantine imperial eagle was ugly . 
   while building up the national capacity to theoretically pay those loans theoretically . 
  with the taxation we have , the rate of migration of our youth abroad and the rate at which our business is closing down or moving to bulgaria , we are n't paying anything back anytime soon . 
  make hellas magal\u0113 again !, 
  we 'll make a wall and make turkey pay for it !, 
  the [ greek 2 euro coin ] ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/coins/common/shared/img/gr/2e.gif ) . 
  it does show europa herself , after all . 
  failing that , the [ italian 1 euro ] ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/coins/common/shared/img/it/1e.gif ) . 
   turkology lol remob sciencebab, 
  somebody is doing worse than us ? 
  also , what 's with cyprus and greece having different 54s ? 
  school occasionally sells sweets for fundraising 'cause we have children 's hospital nearby . 
  people forget to bring money , they come to the one guy who does n't forget . 
  in montreal , but most of these were from fellow europeans . 
  i 'm actually in north america , but in my school there are a lot of people from europe . 
  dunno , just a complilation of what i 've heard so far xd, 
  are n't those baboons ? 
  `` you 're greek , are you sure you 're going to pay me back ? '', 
  `` yeah you totally forgot to pay for her coffee , it 's not like you greeks never pay for anything . '', 
  `` i have a greek friend who always asks other people for cigarettes , you greeks always take other people 's stuff . '', 
  `` you forgot to ask me back for that pen you gave me . 
  did you sleep enough ? '', 
  ( i never ask for my shit back , except for money and even then , rarely ... ) `` wow , how come you give everyone homework and help ? 
  are you sure you 're greek ? '', 
  `` greeks are sexist and racist . '', 
  `` of course you want the money your lent me , all you greeks are greedy . '', 
  `` how are you good in school ? 
  are n't you greeks lazy ? '', 
  `` are n't you all poor ? '', 
  or `` yeah your country might be poor , but why are you working a factory job while you 're underage ? 
  you 're all rich 'cause you do n't pay your taxes . '', 
  `` you have a job ?! '', 
  `` why do you hate germans so much ? '', 
  ( never mind that half of my friends are germans ... ) `` do you have donkeys in athens ? '', 
  `` can you see the parthenon from your house ? 
  why did you guys break it ? '', 
  ( cringe-tacular ) `` yeah i know you guys had like , the first olympics , but that 's not so important ... '' `` why do n't you guys just stop the refugees ? 
  it 's all your fault . '', 
  `` they should just kick you out of the eu for all the problems you 've caused to their economy already . '', 
  `` give me my money back . '', 
  & everyone 's 5 cents on how to totally fix all of greece 's problems . 
  the moment people hear my name , they immediately turn into socio-economic geniuses . 
  shhh , greeks are lazy southerners , remember ? 
  half-barbaric neo-imperialists are totally more trustworthy . 
  nevermind the fact that we had warned of this nearly a year in advance and had been asking for funds and patrols for even longer !, 
  and i assume you have n't gotten any reparations , right ? 
  thankfully , i can not say the same for the jews . 
  nobody deserves what you guys have been through . 
  uhhh , plz let 's not turn this into a serious debate on refugees . 
  we 're still in that phase xd, 
  third , at less than your average northern country ( like sweden for example ? ), 
  and falling . 
  how do you refuse people washing up on your shores or marooned in your waters ? ... 
  it 's not like we have a choice . 
  no idea , but probably yes . 
  their beliefs are none of my concern . 
  borders do exist . 
  i might believe that the euro should n't exist , does that mean i can go around paying in drachmae ? 
  if they cause shit in foreign countries , they should be prepared for the consequences . 
  slightly worse than your far right circles xd, 
  russia does n't need to annex europe by force . 
  all they need to do is annex eastern european nations to reutrn to soviet borders and pressure the rest of us economically to get us in their sphere on influence . 
  if the eu breaks down , which without american presence is bound to happen , there will be no such thing as `` 1.5 million eu soldiers '' and `` 2 nuclear powers '' . 
  not that i know . 
  they caught 15 random people during a ruckus and decided to charge 14 of them ( 1 was a bystander ) . 
  i do n't think you can randomly choose people during chaos , especially given the fact that 3 greeks were also charged . 
  lol, 
  thank you my good man !, 
  fine by me !, 
  as long as those sicilians do n't feel like going staby-staby !, 
  then again , crete would get a friend for once . 
  sorry man , tell that to greek police . 
  what exactly does his constitutional reform entail , if i may ask ? 
  please , do go ahead . 
  we greatly prospered during roman times , as evidenced by the fact that we were in denial about its fall centuries after the fall of rome . 
  edit : orgies and ancient panthea are mandatory . 
  those graphs though ... * cries *, 
  back at it i see ? 
   this is n't a real number . 
  `` those damn italian terrorists with their al-italiah and their lazagnah ! '', 
  `` anyone who is n't an american is , technically , an arab . '', 
  * for an exta $ 50 , you get to kill your own police officer !, 
  the greeks ? 
   tax and pension reforms the foreigners ? ... 
  no clue . 
  should we lock him up with the refugees ? 
  i do n't think he 'll survive without the proper supply schnitzel , classical music and ski , though . 
  `` come to greece and live out your own proletariat fantasies ! '', 
  mitsotakis probably . 
  if we 're gon na have neo-lib policies , might as well have a neo-lib gov ` t. 
  i hate both , but there sadly seems to be no good option for us :( i had so much faith in syriza , but now i 'm just disappointed . 
  i always wanted to ask this , but most of my italian friends are rather well off so i do n't think their opinions would reflect those of the average italian : what do you think of renzi and his policies ?
