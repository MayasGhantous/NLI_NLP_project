  as i said we 're in favour of reforms . 
  but we are n't getting any . 
  we had the balls and we proved it . 
  our gov ' t on the other hand ... 
  all of our industries have already been bought by major northern companies and closed down . 
  what do we have to lose ? 
  a semi-depressed feeling of `` what could have been '' and a sort of warmth . 
  it 's sort of a hate-love relationship . 
  if by reform goals , you mean reducing gdp to 1/3 of what it was , leading a majority for young people to an exodus and a complete destruction of our health and education system , yeah , job well done !, 
  cost of guilt ? 
  seriously ? 
  where 's the `` guilt '' for distomo ? 
  guilt my ass . 
  and they managed to get out of it 'cause of [ debt forgiveness ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/london_agreement_on_german_external_debts ) and [ foreign aid ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marshall_plan ) . 
  how soon we humans forget ... edit : if you disagree , please reply . 
  i 'm not here to insult , i 'm here to discuss . 
  the downvote button is not a disagree button , stop using it as such . 
  yo mate , not all of `` europe '' bullied you . 
  we do n't want this treaty anymore than you do , it 's europe 's major nations that want it . 
  what are going to sell to you , olive oil ? 
  well we already have the eu , it ca n't get any more predatory than that . 
  greece and the british isles : `` dafuq is a lynx ? '', 
  touch\u00e9 . 
  is that la france 's version of a chimera ? 
  that 's what i keep telling my french friends when they 're depressed . 
  i mean , a white lie for a good cause , every now and then , is n't so bad . 
  why do i even click on these , at this point ? 
  i mean , i already know precisely where my country will be !, 
   the dire situation in greece . 
  well i do want grexit to happen !, 
  * cries for being worst shithole in existence *, 
  absolutely nope . 
  even their name is greek . 
  get outta here , filthy frog . 
   rescue lol, 
  well that 's in turkey , they can keep it . 
  we 're taking constantinople though . 
  glorious graeco-bulgarian alliance !, 
  agreed . 
  they were on the winning side , though . 
  that 's as good as winning . 
  edit : we 're talking about wwi ... 
   unlike modern greek who speak a closely related , but different language than ancient greeks modern greeks speak modern greek , which is a simplified version of koine greek , with some foreign loanwords , originating in the 10th century popular koine . 
  koine was spoken since the hellenistic age , was ptolemy also `` closely related but not greek '' ? 
  the english are a germanic people and they founded the us , the us is part of the anglosphere . 
   10 % of americans with english roots , lol definately . 
   probably the same percentage as modern greeks with ancient greek heritage . 
  and on what legit data is that based ? 
  what is an odrin ? 
  when did i say i do n't love the byzantines man ? 
   also it 's always been an enemy and destructive force to my civilization . 
  * sees naples flare * we should totally go byzantine again . 
  sick burn ... eh no pun intended . 
  because the germanics lost the damn war . 
  period . 
  edit : wwi , not wwii idiots . 
  you do know that if the us withdraws from europe , nothing will stop the russians from becoming # 1 , right ? 
  besides , the us has invested so much in its military infrastructure in europe and especially germany , so those bases are staying there as long as the yanks are sane and want to call themselves a superpower . 
  and they got wreckt by the france of the balkans xd not much of a prussia , mind you . 
  well if you wan na annex fyrom go ahead . 
  macedonia and thrace on the other hand ... \u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03ce\u03bd \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03ad !, 
  oh you mean olympic spending . 
  olympia would be a city in the peloponnese where the ancient olympic stadia are . 
  and it 's not our problem if you ca n't get ships to the aegean . 
  international treaties are pretty clear about territorial waters . 
  olympia spending ? 
  precisely what is olympia spending ? 
  for claiming that they saved greece ? 
  schauble himself recently stated that `` greeks should hail him as a hero '' . 
  when your debt is nearing 500 billion , it 's more of a water molecule . 
  * cough * varoufakis * cough *, 
  syriza stalled hoping that this joke of more debt to fix debt would stop . 
  with the results of the loan agreements , even if the capital controls were n't in place , we ca n't buy northern european goods anyway . 
  greeks ca n't spend money on northern european goods now , anyway ... check our unemployment and poverty stats . 
  and ? 
  international law allows us to do so . 
  we ca n't send warships next to your capital , why should you be able to do so ? 
  or , in this case , replacing the water in the fire truck 's valves with oil . 
  treaty of sevres 2.0 , here we come !, 
   really ? 
  must have been before becoming an mep ... 
  indeed , it was . 
  he was in the resource trade business . 
   surely then you can name some of his grievances , what are the ridiculous aspects ? 
  in detail , please . 
  [ here 's a short video with a few . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dranqfntngo ) ignore the shitty editing , please . 
   `` the '' brexit campaign ? 
  this alone shows you know little of the various groups campaigning in favour of brexit . 
  the official leave campaign was vote leave , of which farage was not a part of . 
  yet farage , admittedly , had a leading role in brexit . 
  `` official '' and `` most important '' are not often the same   are you implying acting like a clown in parliament is useful ? 
  no wonder you like farage . 
  are you incapable of reading a sentence ? 
  i did n't say that . 
  no wonder you like the eu . 
  he 's actually worked a day in his life . 
  he points out the ridiculous aspects of much of the eu bureaucracy and eu elites . 
  he successfully led the brexit campaign instead of having the media do it for him . 
  sounds pretty competent , whether you agree with him or not .
