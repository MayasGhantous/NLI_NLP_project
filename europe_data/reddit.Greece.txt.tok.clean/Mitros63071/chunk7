  / s tourk\u00eda : uhhh , the food i guess ? 
  we do n't really get along , so i do n't really know what to say . 
  i 'd say the tourist sites and cities , but most of them are originally greek , so no point there . 
  oh yes , the kurds . 
  definately the kurds !, 
  jokes aside , they 're pretty legit . 
  their gov ' t is crap , but the people are actually rather nice , some at least . 
  voulghar\u00eda : the scenery . 
  and the fact that they 're our least crazy and neighbour . 
  i kind of like the bulgarians . 
  we should get closer . 
  their chess , literature and culture in general are also pretty solid . 
  scratch that , we should definately get closer . 
  plus they hate fyrom almost as much as we do . 
  alvan\u00eda : their greek minority . 
  and their cheap prostitution , i guess . 
  fyrom/pgdm/d \u012bmokrat\u00eda tou v\u00e1rdar\u012b / paion\u00eda / sk\u00f3pia / land x : their declining birth rate .

  it reads `` turk '' on top ... 
  i was reading the turkish column and i felt slightly bad for the turks , even though i 'm greek .

  holy bull-balls , the insulars are fighting !!!!, 
  i bet 50 euros on the challoumi one !, 
  m8 , i love how you have a name refercencing greek mythology xd, 
  as a napol\u00e9on and alexander fanboy i do sincerely approve this message !, 
  alexander definately had the same effect as napol\u00e9on on post-classical greece . 
  up until then all efforts to unite had been blocked by greek state themselves ( the athenians saw themselves as athenians & ionians first , greeks second , the spartans saw themselves as spartans & dorians first and greeks second etc. ), 
  only the fear of a foreign invasion could unite the greeks and even then , their leagues ( sympoliteiae ) were more like the current eu and nato than an actual federation . 
  both philip and alexander defeated the athenians and thebans when they resisted unification and he replaced all greek dialects with koine and all local greek cultures with a standardised hellenistic culture . 
  he always dedicated the trophies of his campaigns in athens ( percevied since then to this day as the `` \u039a\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03bd \u0386\u03c3\u03c4\u03c5 '' meaning `` grand city '' , the de facto capital , school and cultural centre of greece ) , instead of pella , to athena , with the inscription `` alexander and the greeks '' instead of `` alexander and the macedonians '' . 
  this is of no coincidence ; alexander was taught by aristotle ( also born in macedon , though he moved to athens like most greek philosophers ) , the very same man who wrote that `` the hellenic ( greek ) nation lives excellently and is ruled splendidly and it would domianate ( the world ) were it so lucky as to be united under a common state '' . 
  by the way , for those arguing that the macedonians were not greek because demosthenes and some other athenians said so , the athenians did this for political reasons , as if macedon was to be generally accepted as part of greece , athens would lose her place as the strongest mainland greek city-state ( similar to how many modern western european politicians reject russia as non-european , ignoring russia 's immense contributions to european culture and civilisation for strategic reasons ) . 
  history did prove the athenians right , since once the macedonians were accepted as greek they united greece as the hellenic league in corinth , under their own hegemony . 
  also strabo , one of the greatest , if not the greatest , ancient greek geographers once stated that `` macedonia , too , is greece '' ( \u1f18\u03c3\u03c4\u1f76 \u00b5\u1f72\u03bd \u03bf\u1f56\u03bd \u1f19\u03bb\u03bb\u1f70\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f21 \u039c\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 ) . 
  additionally , even if by some miracle macedonians were n't greeks , alexander 's mother was the daughter of the king of epirus ( the epirots were the ` original ' and probably ` purest ' greeks , only rivalled in both sections by the mountainous dorians of central greece ) . 
  in short the claim that alexander was not greek would be just as ridiculous as the claim that napoleon was n't french , since both men united the very nations in question . 
  it cuts both ways ... 
  i do n't get what the fuss is . 
  the imf simply recognised the truth : * the greek gov ' t is an eu ( mainly german ) puppet so there 's not point in pretending to negotiate with them * the germans and in denial refuse to accept the reality that the greek debt is unpayable and if they keep at it without a haircut they 'll just lose more money * the only way for the germans to see reality is for shit to hit the fan , since right now they 're busy with trying to keep the uk locked up in the basement * if the imf wastes any more money on the greek debacle , thomsen and vikaleskou will lose their jobs . 
  you do n't need an imf leak to tell you that , you need a pair of eyes and ears and a normal number of chromosomes . 
  you do know that we paid for your development fund and got you in the eu right ? 
  if we all thought that way you 'd still be a soviet craphole . 
  we feel you . 
  now they 're asking us to lower them below 600 euros . 
  we all need our hobbies :d, 
  the relocation programme ... right ... 
  greek army entangled in battles ? 
  against who ? 
  you 're delusional . 
  why the downvotes ? 
  this was the best post i 've seen today . 
  thank you , random citizen !, 
  happy independence ireland !!!!!!, 
  hopefully you 'll get the whole island some day !!!, 
  watch out though , i 've heard they have a rather explosive temper . 
  well i mean occupying half of their country is kinda destabilising on its own , you do n't need to go beyond that . 
  plus they have an active casus belli on us if we ever expand our territorial waters to 24 nautical miles , as allowed by international law . 
  got ta love erdogan 's foreign policy , it shouts peace & love !!!, 
  somebody ca n't take a joke ... 
  besides who cares what cyprus wants ? 
  we know what 's best for them ! / s, 
  wan na try another war for old time 's sake ?
