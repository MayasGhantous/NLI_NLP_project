  of course this happens , but it 's reserved for the elite of this place , the friends of those who ruled this place from 1974 to this january for the rest , all we can get from the state are promises in the shape of polished turds and a shit-ton of hopelessness, 
  or maybe they 're sick and tired of not being able to find a job and having to live off their parent 's pensions , do n't you think antonaki ? 
  both options definitely have covert dangers . 
  but the majority of the people , those who do n't have money to hide in switzerland or lichtenstein , are sick and tired of the unstoppable austerity and want a better direction, 
  t : antonis samaras, 
  it 's gon na be a long and painful week god damn you tsipra, 
   how do they pay their bills that come due the first of the month in our days sometimes the dilemma is `` should i pay the bills or should i provide food for my family ? '', 
  guess what people are forced to chose . 
  and many employers are abusing this fact . . 
  as you said , not everyone has gone abroad to open a bank account . 
  most people just keep the money at home which in a grexit situation would be something good because it would be like remittances of foreign currency ( since greece would have ditched euro ), 
  sorry mate , you guys are right it 's 1:00 am right now , imagine being calm and sleepy and suddenly you see this mess everywhere not even the strongest coffee can give you this rush ... 
  guess i 'm gon na get my first ever usd on monday, 
  you 're probably right and i hope people will understand that our parliament is full of treacherous snakes like him, 
  \u0391lso note it was announced at friday midnight . 
  so that people wo n't go and drain the banks even if some high ranked members of the parliaments said that the banks wo n't have any problem on monday , unfortunately things in the past have shown otherwise, 
  as it seems , that 's a big deal right now and nobody is saying anything on the news , because definitely a referendum that calls us directly or indirectly to vote if we 're gon na stay in the eurozone is definitely a fiscal matter, 
  because if we find ourselves out of eurozone , while all of our debts are tied to euro and without any prospects of growth and 0 heavy industries will destroy greece 34 years of the progress we 've had as members of the european union and the european economic community will be ditched into the trashcan . 
  the matter is very serious and the prime minister should be aware of that and even more aware of the implications anything bad would have on greece and on his self, 
  article 44 of the constitution , paragraph 2 : * 2 . 
  the president of the republic shall by decree proclaim a referendum on crucial national matters following a resolution voted by an absolute majority of the total number of members of parliament , taken upon proposal of the cabinet . 
  a referendum on bills passed by parliament regulating important social matters , with the exception of the fiscal ones shall be proclaimed by decree by the president of the republic , if this is decided by three-fifths of the total number of its members , following a proposal of two-fifths of the total number of its members , and as the standing orders and the law for the application of the present paragraph provide . 
  no more than two proposals to hold a referendum on a bill can be introduced in the same parliamentary term . 
  it 's all about the public sector and the way our state mechanism rolls . 
  ** no government from the current political system will ever do anything to reform the state and make it work better ** . 
  the wo n't ever touch their main voting pool they 'll just tax the rest of us to hell , up until the tipping point when everybody will go nuts and they 'll gon na need helicopters to leave the parliament building , a la argentina style . 
  i 've seen this one vast majority of early retirees are 1-5 years before the retirement age and definitely have had lost their jobs in the process , getting kicked out of your job in greece while you 've passed 40 years of age is almost 100 % sure you 'll never get a job again , even if you got a huge cv and plenty of experience . 
  so most of them just gather their working stamps and apply for an early , butchered pension ( which in some cases might be more than 45 % less than the money they would have gotten had they have reached the age limit ) only people with disabilities or sicknesses , military personnel and mothers of more than 50 years of age and with non adult children have the right to leave their jobs before the retirement age . 
  should we hang them for this ? 
   75 % of greeks retiring early back to / pol / now , mate, 
  so , how 's things ? 
  pretty straight forward : for a european , first world country , it 's utterly rubbish where do i start i wonder ? 
  first of all , when this all started we told ourselves we 'll make it through in 3-4 years and then we 'll be starting to make steady steps towards the future . 
  but as the time passed , we got sad , frustrated and depressed when we realized that things are n't gon na improve anytime soon . 
  we pretend we do n't care , but in reality sadness is slowly killing the population is it the `` bad germans '' ( some people really do think that ) ? 
  is it our beyond-any-repair broken state ? 
  is it the fact that we realised we were stupid in the past and voted for parties that closed down our biggest industries and factories ( see below ) ** and turned the place into an economy dependant on loans ? 
  does n't matter anymore , the damage has already been done this generation has been the most educated greece ever had and every day more and more young people are leaving country to go abroad and work there . 
  the greek state paid for their education so that some other nation would get them and incorporate them into their industries . 
  in my case , at least 10 acquaintances have gone to england and live there , getting good money and enjoying their lives . 
  getting a job here , on your degree , is practically impossible . 
  if you know someone high up ( not necessarily political ) , you might get more chances by stepping on other people 's cvs and get the job for yourself . 
  otherwise , you get even more depressed when seeing ads that say `` we hire holders of phd 's , less than 30 years old with at least 3-4 years of experience , salary 400 euros '' people that are lucky enough to work are subjected to every kind of `` torture '' their employees might think of . 
  many are staying in their jobs even though they are n't being paid for months or even years , knowing that if you 're more than 40-45 , it 's absolutely impossible to get a job if you happen to be sacked from your previous . 
  so you just stay there , unpaid and with the household bills running . 
  who 's gon na save you , help you pay food for your kids and family ? 
  the answer is the next paragraph pensioners , in reality very few people have gotten in pension and were less than 60 years old , the vast majority of them were people that were doing hazardous jobs or mothers with sick children . 
  the rest got their pensions from the age of 62 to 67 which is the age limit now . 
  what do they do with their pensions ? 
  helping their families , even their grown up children that got their own families , to make ends meet and pay what they can . 
  sometimes , there 's the dillema `` should i pay the electricity bills , my medications or should i help my son/daughter feed their kids ? '', 
  many of those people are those who voted for the bad parties back in their day and they 're too paying the price hospitals have too have problems with liquidity , many of them have serious shortages on even basic stuff like bandages and antiseptics and sometimes , the docs are bringing their own in order to be able to do their work . 
  docs also have unpaid wages or overtime bonuses for a long time . 
  these things are happening in athens , imagine what 's going on other cities . 
  for example , a russian magnate named dmitry rybolovlev , owner of the scorpios island - former safe heaven of aristotle onassis - , has donated 20.000 euros to the lefkada hospital so that they can hire new doctors that have just finished medical school ( i do n't know the correct terminology in english ) . 
  this happened after the president of the island 's doctor council sent him a letter asking him to help his neighboring island in that matter that 's just the tip of the iceberg , there are many more things i ca n't remember of to write here or maybe set aside so that i do n't go full depressed by remembering them . 
  all that i know is that if we are gon na be kicked out of the ez , the sea will be filled with people trying to flee the country . 
  and i hope syriza too are understanding this , or they might find themselves on trial or worse , dead , if they bring the country to the ground . 
  people are literally fed up with everything at this point ** greece in the 1970 's had the second biggest growth worldwide , just behind japan . 
  there were hundrends of factories around , biggest of them were the pirelli factory in patras ( closed down 1991 ) , [ the goodyear factory in sindos ( closed down in 1996 ) ] ( http://tvxs.gr/sites/default/files/imagecache/node_image/article/2010/16/35725-goodyear.jpg ) and [ nissan-teokar in volos ( closed down in 1995 ) ] ( http://www.zougla.gr/automoto/article/teokar-giati-eklise-to-ergostasio-tis-nisan-ston-volo ) . 
  pasok and their fiscal economic policies have forced the big companies out of greece , all of these in order to make the citizens more dependant to the populist-nepotist state . 
  did you just made this account just to post this ? 
  nice one / u/athinker, 
  the indignants movement also did n't involve rioting and stuff too, 
   average normal people more like privileged middle age people who made a lot of money by working in the public sector tbh and of course , people with money do n't give a shit about those who live with 200 euros per month . 
  especially those erratic nd voters, 
  dude !, 
  do n't post this , they 're gon na downvote you :d, 
  i agree althought not all pro-ez supports are in for more cuts to their wages or pensions , especially the latter since nowadays in greece there are whole families that are practically forced to live off the elder 's pensions and i do n't think many of these people went there to demonstrate also we should all know that georgiadis and his party prefered putting us in an unstoppable train of recession instead of actually doing serious reforms and change the way the greek state is working from the inside . 
  that 's what the europeans have been asking us from the beginning but we chose to stab ourselves with endless cuts and taxation over imaginary incomes . . 
  please , try talking to an nd supporter and you 'll understand why i do n't like them at all, 
  of course everyone has the right to demonstrate and express his opinions in public since we 're in a democratic nation . 
  and as a result of this , i have the right to have an opinion to this personally i would n't want to be standing next to that guy , adonis , a man notorious for changing his political views according to his interests , a man that voted and publicly supported for extreme cuts for the poor with the excuse that `` these things are unfortunate but they should happen '' while he 's getting paid with 7000 euros per month and a man who proposed a 25 euro ticket for all patients , no matter if they had any money left , just to get inside one of our shitty public hospitals . 
  ** edit : itt , kids that do n't know shit about greek politics and politicians downvoting you for expressing your opinions . 
  you can understand exactly what kind of demonstration it is [ just by seeing what politicians have also joined the demonstrators ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8hqp2ph.jpg ) this is adonis georgiadis btw , one of the most deluded , narcissistic lying scumbags politicians greece ever got , i 'm all for a pro eu demonstration but not for a pro nd-and-pasok one, 
   that 's a pretty lame description of the person . 
  he could not advocate shit ( because his position was not political ) and he was fired by samaras ( because he applied the laws that others voted ) . 
  yeah , it 's also lame the fact that this person wanted to give himself a ** special bonus ** for only doing his job ( what we call here in greece , `` miza '' ) , based on how much revenue the state would have gotten by the ( poor ) citizens that found themselves indebted to the state https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=el&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.koutipandoras.gr%2farticle%2f104184%2fntokoymento-o-theoharis-dinei-mponoys-ston-eayto-toy&amp;edit-text= and of course , under nd and pasok 's coalition , none of his `` rich '' tax evading friend was ever prosecuted , as you should know . 
  at least , as deluded as syriza seems to be , they had the balls to arrest leonidas bobolas and force him pay the money he owed for a long time did the others do anything similar ? 
   as for potami being bobolas ' party , same can be said about all parties , as all of them are more or less have ties with some magnate or another . 
  yeah , when our beloved bobolas saw that his friend at nd , pasok and democratic left would lost power , he decided to put his lapdog journalist as an `` aspiring politician '' nothing suspicious here , right ? 
   do n't be a partizan idiot . 
  calling me a partizan ( and while i was never affiliated with leftism/communism ) while you 're totally oblivious is ironic , at least, 
  ah yeah , haris theoharis , a former lehman brothers executive , former aspis insurance executive ( that was an insurance company that went bankrupt and left all of her clients without health and car insurance - the latter being serious offense in greece ) and former secretary of income of the ministry of economics , in which during his tenure he advocated for the voting of a law that defined that everyone that owes more than 5.000 euros to the state is liable for ** prosecution ** and ** incarceration ** and now an mp with potami , a political party directly involved with the bobolas family ( media and construction magnates ) , one of the main families that stole your money , my fellow europeans during all of these years i could n't care less for the shit this guy says, 
  ayy we 're getting 5 stations , smart thinking by tesla , knowing that people would prefer the electic vehicle rather than the petrol ones ( 1.50-1 .60 euros per litre with a wage of 400 euros does n't come easy - and this price applies to athens and the rest of big cities only ) too bad our government will probably find a way to tax the hell out of the teslas , just to get money . 
  it was happening before the crisis and it will happen again, 
  you are right on this , but let me make some notes indeed , everything starts and ends with the debt . 
  but most greeks know that it 's not only the correlation between the debt and the gdp , it 's also the fact that greece does not have the ** heavy ** industry that a country in our place should have olive oil , tourism and crude oil ( in very small quantities ) are our main exports , but they ca n't save the day . 
  we need factories to open and qualified people to work on these . 
  we need to disengage ourselves from the mentality of the past that `` only the work in the public sector will help live an adequate life '' and finally start pushing towards the future . 
  of course , the reforms the lenders are currently asking not only do n't take us to that road , but actually they push towards a deeper and worsened recession . 
  that 's why i said we first and foremost need to show a unified leadership to the europeans and decided that 's it 's time to make serious reforms , even if those will make the parties lose votes . 
  if we treat europe with seriousness , they 'd stop asking these ridiculous things and then we 'll be able to have a serious talk . 
  sure , [ here 's a map of the aegean sea ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dr3llde.jpg ) , right of rhodes is the island of megisti , also called castellorizon the more far from athens you go , the more expensive things are becoming . 
  i , and many others , believe that having the same vat for the city of athens and a remote islands will only destroy their local economies , especially now when the populations there barely make ends meet . 
  prices will skyrocket , even in basic products like milk and bread and combined with the continued recession , this will also hurt tourism a lot and in the instance of castellorizon , considering turkey has been constantly breaking international laws and tresspassing our naval and aerial borders constantly , it 's an utmost urgency to help people there staying in the island by providing them with everything they need at as much as closer prices to the one 's the people of the mainland have . 
  austerity will only stop once the government , the opposition and the rest of the parties decide to take radical measures . 
  some examples i have in mind : * clearing up the public sector from the perjured public sector employees ( these are all those who got caught getting brides or did n't do their jobs at all ) and stop various high ranked public sector employees that hold more than 1 positions ( yeah , that 's been happening in greece and those people have sometimes the right to get a second pension ) * reform the taxation system ( eg : connecting in real time the receipt machines of each shop with a central database of the ministry of economics ) in a form that will start killing tax evasion . 
  also make the legislation more appealing to possible investors to come here * reduction of the bureaucracy * impose heavy fines to those who employ uninsured personnel ( that 's been killing us slowly ) * promote tourism and reduce vat for all the remote islands ( eg , castellorizo and rhodes ca n't have the same vat as syros or kythyra ) i want to tell that you do n't really need memorandums and other deals to make reforms and persuade europe that `` yeah guys , we 're trying to do better here '' . 
  what 's been happening till now is governments getting elected in false promises and then blaming the europeans that `` we did n't do nothing wrong , give us money '' if we 'd really wanted to do serious reforms instead of bollocks , we would n't need to reduce pensions/wages and impose new taxes .
