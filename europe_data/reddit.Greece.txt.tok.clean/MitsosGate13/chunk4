  greece on the other hand is the prodigal child , someone that some people on these countries think it does n't deserve sympathy nor help and we should be punished for the mistakes we did in the harshest way possible . 
  we 're being weak and totally vunerable at this point and this has turned us to the perfect scapegoat . 
  so the very same countries we voted in favor of integrating them into the union , now turn their backs on us and propose every kind of humiliating measures in order to keep the immigrants in greece , including talks with the fyr of macedonia , giving funds to turkey ( who allowed them to cross their borders and came to ours , the european borders ) and even suggesting that we should allow their ships inside our naval space , even thought they 're aware that turkey [ violates and disputes our borders in every possible way they can ] ( http://www.tovima.gr/en/article/?aid=775815 ) it 's their right to seek solutions for the immigrant situation , but it 's antieuropean and unethical to behave like that to greece or to any other member that might face this kind of problems, 
  a reminder on why greece or any other country should be more sceptical before voting in favor of the integration of some country into the european union especially when some of the newest members are working with non eu members over fucking greece up and blaming us for not draining the aegean sea and put fences on it . 
  [ no such agreement has been achieved ] ( http://www.independent.mk/articles/27427/nikola+gruevski+rejects+irredentism,+refers+to+name+issue+in+%22to+vima%22+interview ), 
   i hoep greece wo n't turn this around on them and be sore in the future when it comes to eu negotiations . 
  as long as they call themselves macedonia , no greek government will ever vote in favor of them in any negotiations , whether it 's for nato or the eu integration . 
  and even if there are people who are open to debate the naming issue ( much how syriza was before they grabbed the chairs ) , the political cost of such a move is way too big to be ignored .

  those people will never get a majority to form a government , most of their voters will stop voting for them once they see someone better , someone who would really want to help the country and not use his power for his own gains in expense of the poor people . 
  but we have n't got anyone like this until now . 
  now the same media that crucified him a year ago , are talking flattering about him and his government at most cases . 
  that 's an indication that he decided to lie to his voters and side with the big heads that leeched away our national resources for so long, 
  as it turned out in the process , the was pretending to be something he probably knew he could never become . 
  plus , asking for europe to change before you even try to change your own country was never going to work he got there , liked the nice chair and decided he will stay there for the time being . 
  and of course , [ he and his cabinet are continuing the same shit ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2016/01/18/eu-officials-express-concerns-over-nepotism-in-greek-government-under-syriza/ ) that brought us in this whole mess , while everyone [ are losing hope for the future ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2016/01/23/different-opinion-polls-show-greeks-pessimistic-about-future/ ) he lied to everyone to get elected and tried to play smart to bigger fish than him and now we 'll be paying the price . 
  we 're merely paying the price of choosing a bunch of treacherous greedy clowns as our governments for the past 40 or so years . 
  at this point we 're on , we appear as a moving joke of a country of course the result of this is the total disesteem of the rest of the eu , which turns us into the perfect scapegoat for their own political reasons and while our government does nothing to fight back . 
   we are both in nato . 
  i do n't understand why people think we are sworn enemies [ yo dude , it was just a prank ] ( http://www.dw.com/image/0,,15883506_303,00.jpg ), 
  i agree mate , we all said stupid things when we were kids . 
  but theres a difference between saying something like `` french/greek/british / german people are assholes '' and `` we will fuck you up '' . 
  it shows a deeper issue , a growing hatred against everything and anything tied to france . 
  even so , most of them probably leave it aside partly or completely , but what happens to those who do n't ? 
  they will join extremists , given the chance , especially if they feel rejected and oppressed ( which at a certain point is really an issue ) . 
  and this will lead to bataclans and more dead people and we 're talking about people who your country has long been allowing them to come and live in france and some of them excelled while wearing the french colours ( see zidane and benzema for example ) . 
  people who already had some connection to the french culture via colonialism ( marocco , algeria , tunisia , etc ) arabs from middle east are n't having the same mentality and this is exactly why there must be a very serious procedure in order to grant them asylum . 
  crossing borders and going into a country without even a proper checking will lead to horrors eventually and the people who really deserve to come and live in our countries will again find the terror that forced them to flee their countries in front of them . . 
   they feel rejected they live in a first world country , far from wars and pain , and they claim to want to `` fuck up france '' because they feel rejected ? 
  this is why this whole mess happens , because people rationalize this kind of behaviour if you do n't like france , germany , uk , greece , italy or wherever you live , you 're free to go back to your country and play russian roulette with isis and insurgents . 
  but once you live in europe , you should respect the people that gave you a chance to live next to them , not threaten them . . 
  yeap , spain has many factions wanting independence and it ca n't even be compared to the cretan state . 
  it 's ironic though that seeing this map you see that central europe has a much bigger `` balkanization '' rating than the actual balkan region . 
   there is today a general sentiment among the population that crete should or could be independent i 've never heard any cretans advocating or saying that . 
  after all , they 're as much greeks as the rest of us , any talks about a supposed `` autonomy '' are based upon the general sentiment of displeasure over the evergoing recession , which is present to all greeks atm . 
  yup , i agree . 
  just imagine how much money would be saved if all the pensioners were to be shot with rifles !, 
   this will honestly be tsipras undoing you seriously underestimating the hordes of morons who voted him in september even when they knew he would have to vote for barbaric `` reforms '' . 
  increased taxes and cuts to pensions and other benefits . 
  i predict that he will soon start using the summer trick and pass the legislations with the votes of mps of other parties . 
  it 's clear he 's totally incapable of managing anything good . . as for the migrant issue , this will probably boost nd 's percentages once they get their shit together and finally elect a president . 
  and all of those guys together will continue fucking us over and over again, 
  given the problems turkey has caused to greece in the past , he will probably have to use the same `` diplomatic '' methods mrs. merkel and mr. schauble used on him during those wonderful summer meetings , since they seem to do magic on people, 
  he was a small point though , austerity was needed but only up to a certain point now , what the ez members and the other creditors have asked tsipras to do is a genocide . 
  nothing good will come out of this and the citizens of the rich eu countries will be forced again to pay money to us as loans , thus continuing this endless circle of throwing money into bottomless pits . 
  is this what the german media are telling you we want ? 
  are you really asking me this ? 
  i want a job and i want to be able to pay my taxes , because now nothing of these two things is happening to me and for millions others that live in my country ( greeks or not greeks ) . 
  i 'm getting taxed over zero income and i 'm also called upon to pay a property tax ( 600 euros per year ) for a 40 year old house that needs a lot of money for fixing and maintenance , which is already do n't have we can not possibly pay any more taxes here , at least not without jobs . 
  the whole southern europe has been brought upon this , not only greece . 
  eu and the other heads over there should push for growth instead of overtaxation and cuts , this is what they should have done if they had the welfare of their people in mind , not forcing me to take the plane and go to work to germany or the uk as a waiter so that i can pay the taxes back home this is n't the europe people want and definitely this is n't the europe that people had dreamed of back in 1950 's, 
  so we should better be fucked up our arses for the rest of our lives !, 
  100 euro wages , 50 euros pensions , 500 billion pledge fund of the greek state and 80 % unemployment !, 
  that will teach us a lesson !, 
  ( inb4 someone who might claim that i believe greece has done everything right , because we have failed miserably in that ), 
  you 're a disgrace to all the turks that have seen what lies beyond their border and understood the wrongdoings of your nation back to / pol / now , kid, 
  what anatolia ? 
  the one you burned to the ground and killed everybody at that region speaking greek in order to force us out ? 
  whether you like it or not `` istanbul '' as you call it will always bear the mantle of the byzantine empire , the patriarchate and hagia sofia are there and a big part of your tourism comes from all the byzantine and ancient greek monuments around turkey we had nothing to prove , we have n't touched an inch of your ground since 1922 but you have systematically abused all the greeks living there and eventually sent them out with pogroms , invaded cyprus in 1974 , caused the sismik crisis back in the 80 's and even in 1996 , you put your flags on the [ islet of imia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imia/kardak ) , which is inside the greek naval border , turning it with the help of nato into a grey zone it 's more than clear you 're the problem in the region and not armenians , greeks , jews , georgians and all the others, 
  i can testify to that from my buddy who was in rhodes for his army conscription . 
  but it 's a matter of fact that you guys started all of those moves and we just answer and this bullshit will go on for an eternity unless you ( the turkish government ) stop seeing greece as a seceded ottoman state . 
  we ca n't possibly compare how was england in the 1940s with how is afghanistan and iraq today , because over there it 's literally like they live in the middle ages, 
  what you say is true , but still the countries over there have not gone through a progressive phase like ours did . 
  and in some cases , when the progressive phase came , the big powers have intervened and stopped this wave of progression ( see the islamic revolution in iran for example ), 
  i 'm under no circumstances an advocate of uncontrolled immigration , but i can not blame the people who run to save their lives from the isis jihadists there 's no future waiting for you if you sit there and die , slaughtered by islamist radicals, 
  i can only feel sorry for all the people who genuinely came in europe for a better future , far away from the griefs and pain of the war it appears that with them , people who advocate this inhuman planning have come in our countries . 
  and we 're all unprepared to face a threat like this one . . 
  this will probably come after [ taiped ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fde.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fhellenic_republic_asset_development_fund&amp;edit-text= ) and that other 50 billion euros worth greek privatization fund will have sold out everything . 
  nothing like this supposed huge debt relief ever comes for free ** added taiped link from german wiki , translated to english, 
  oh come now , literally you lived off turkey since the time the island was divided in 2 and your state stayed internationally unrecognized . 
  of course economic matters would play a role into persuading your people that staying `` independent/isolated '' would n't be enough to help you develop , especially when the greek side of cyprus is thriving it definitely played a part , small or big i 'm not qualified to say, 
  \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03b7 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1 added english translation : * it would be wise if you were n't insulting your fellow interlocutors and instead trying to explain them where they have wrong . 
  have a nice day *, 
  because there 's literally a fenced out place on the island of cyprus that 's been left untouched for 41 years ? 
  you might know about varosha but many readers in here probably do n't, 
  but it exists and this is because turkey declined to hand it over to the greek cypriots . 
  varosha is like a time capsule and everything has stopped in 1974 although i 've come to realize that turkish cypriots have seen the progress the greek side has done and they eventually want to join them and progress . 
  because up until this point they were simply waiting for momma turkey to help them out, 
  try searching `` varosha '' on google and you 'll realize / u/astalano is n't kidding, 
  sounds like he had a good kdr, 
  stop spreading misinformation about the state of greek schooling system , we 're not in the 1970s anymore i had kids with various religious background ( jw and hindu ) in my school and none of them was forced to attend any orthodox stuff nor they got ridiculed by anybody , so i do n't know in what village you went to school in , but the things you claim rarely happen, 
  greeks are literally called `` ionians '' in turkish , too . . 
  you 're spending too much energy on an irrelevant matter . 
  i had non christian classmates on school ( muslim and jw ) and they never had any problems with the religious lesson at school , it was easy to sign off of it nor their parents ever protested for its existence . 
  i 'm all in for the proposed changes from syriza , but i 'm afraid it will be more like `` we did something just to say that we did it '' , rather than actually changing stuff , like they do in most of their policies today . 
  as for the `` christian persecution '' crap , unlike the western church , the orthodox christianity was actively persecuted by every kind of authoritarian rulers ( ottoman muslims and soviets/communists ) and most people still do n't get happy when see religion being mocked or when religious symbolisms being removed, 
  so , if you 're so disgruntled with greece , return us every single euro our country ( gr ) has given you since your eu integration in 2004 that does n't sound good when you 're in a union , does it ? 
  also , taken in fact that 25 % of your population is russian and their motherland loves to invade and annex you every once in a while , show some fucking respect for a country thats highly supportive of democracy and vouched for your participation in nato as an ally , thus guaranting that such misfortunes wo n't happen to your country as long as this alliance stands, 
  so , simitis was good at economics ? 
  of course , with the high quality of the book cooking he and his cabinet did to put us inside the eurozone we really should make him a huge statue like the one macedonians have for alexander the great in the main square of skopje, 
  as we speak , your government does whatever they can to pressure ours into handing over the 8 who fled in order to save their lives , because it 's more than clear now those soldiers were the dispensable pawns in this whole case , especially since they openly admit into reintroducing the capital sentence for `` acts of treason '' i ca n't fathom how i 'd feel if i 'd face what those people had , since both greeks and turks have being conscripted into the army to serve our countries and those guys have found themselves disgraced and on the run just because they followed orders ( and choosing to lay down their arms rather than shooting their compatriots ) their lives must be protected at all costs, 
  no , cyprus wants their stolen lands back, 
  my turkish friends , i wish you the best from this , please keep your heads down and wait before you do anything , stay safe, 
  that 's exactly what we need atm , [ more members of our royal family to reclaim their long-defunct titles ] ( http://www.greekroyalfamily.gr/en/faq.html ), 
  lol i wonder if the same truck was parading in athens , how much time will it take before someone/some people went after it to smash it . . 
  i hate the bureaucratic way the eu works nowadays , but the ecb was n't obliged to succumb to the tsipras-varoufakis cheap plan . 
  they 're a bank and they want their investments back and of course they ca n't give out money for free beggars ca n't be chosers and tsipras fucked us badly with the way he treated the subject . 
  and he still continues to follow his lies and delusions, 
   despite warnings from people like varoufakis thank god it was n't mr. mparoufakis and the syriza charlatans who closed the banks and imposed the ccs . . oh wait . . 
  the public sector employees do those strikes , the rest of us just pass the day without public transport and other public services ( which sucks ),
