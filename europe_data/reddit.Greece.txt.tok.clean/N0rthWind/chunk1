well ... not exactly . 
  * oh shit , * now that you mention it , i misplaced my knife !, 
  have you seen it around ? 
  it 's pretty noticeable, 
  very true . 
  i could definitely stab you over proposing to bomb silent hill . 
  * you do n't touch silent hill . 
  that 's what i think will happen . 
  the people react too slowly to reality to do anything about it , if anything they can still be fooled into supporting the disastrous big fish , the big fish will not stop eating until nothing is left , they do n't realize or care that their wealth means nothing if the planet is not fucking habitable anymore ... and so we rush churning towards disaster . 
  and to be honest i am glad every time i hear a shocking development - brexit , bees going extinct , temperatures reaching new heights , the planet 's resources being depleted , extremist groups gaining power ... it 's great . 
  and it 's great because this is * real consequences * . 
  i 've always felt that we should n't get to fuck up this bad and not suffer immediate consequences because then we just do it again . 
  and again . 
  so i 'm happy that at last we are reaching the end of the line , and things are starting to get ** tangibly ** worse . 
  climate change , species going extinct , terrorism , inequality , third world poverty , all of that was either just `` theoretical warnings '' or too far from the average western citizen 's life to affect their choices . 
  but no more . 
  our society kept surviving total failure by abusing earth , but earth is starting to run dry and so is our society . 
  and thus , voting for trump , disregarding the environment , not caring about wars , guns , immigrants , oceans , emissions , human rights ... these are no more inconsequential . 
  you vote for trump ? 
  good . 
  do it and see what happens , see if you try it again . 
  you think the climate change is a `` liberal pussy hoax '' ? 
  good . 
  when crucial creatures start going extinct instead of only rare animals you do n't care about , it 'll be too late . 
  and * you 'll * be the first to go bankrupt and live under a bridge , not the owners of monsanto . 
  it 's about time ignorance no longer goes unpunished . 
  we are finally getting what we deserve as a species . 
  yes , i made this up , but usually his answers are way more all-over-the-place than this . 
  and i wish i was exaggerating but sadly it 's completely true, 
  i explained in another comment above , 
  i 'm pretty sure trump wins the ignorance prize . 
  hillary might still have left some loose ends in her machine , but overall she 's experienced in this game . 
  trump , on the other hand , should have been a disaster from day 1 , but the people loved him . 
  getting fooled by hillary is one thing , and i can see why the shiny woman-president supported by a lot of female celebrities can persuade the foolish to support her , but * loving trump * has set a new all-time low . 
  the man does n't even * try * to be likeable , quite the opposite actually , and the people just think he 's being up-front . 
  he 's like a troll candidate gone too far . 
  if he 's elected i will not be surprised if he says * `` well , i did my absolute best to become the most distasteful , ignorant , bigoted candidate to see how far i could get away with it . 
  every month i would try to release something even more shockingly grotesque to the press to see if i 'd manage to get kicked out of the election , and instead you made me president , you giggling imbeciles . 
  it 's the root of the same problem . 
  being ok with your government bombing '' * some city * '' for good measure , not knowing * or caring * whether it 's justified or not , is the same logic that says that people owning guns is a good thing . 
  not to mention the classic arguments `` if we are unarmed then criminals will still get guns and kill us '' and `` people kill people , not guns '' . 
  well , in europe where gun laws are much stricter we do n't have mass shootings every week , whereas in the us where people are * `` able to defend themselves * '' children massacre each other in their schools every other month . 
  and instead of banning guns , they say `` cool then we 'll bring guns in schools so they can defend themselves '' . 
  and i 'm positive the shootings will just increase . 
  so yeah . 
  * guns * kill people . 
  armed criminals are not enough to warrant gun ownership to * this * extent . 
  it 's just an addiction . 
  an addiction so powerful that their kids and citizens getting shot on a daily basis is not enough to break it . 
  in a country where the use of lethal weapons is always an option within arm 's reach , it does n't take a psychology major to see why shootings are much , * much * more common . 
  i 'm not really sure they all grasped this irony . __ . 
  i can not help but be thoroughly impressed by how these elections are turning out . 
  you managed to filter down to the absolute worst candidates from both parties . 
  you had * really * great options among the democrats and much more softcore options in the gop and you managed to narrow it down between the personification of corruption and an uneducated , ignorant , unapologetic billionaire man-child . 
  personally i 'd definitely choose utter corruption over utter bigoted lunacy , but both are terrifying options . 
  `` what are your plans to tackle the financial deficit , mr trump ? '', 
  `` well , the financial deficit . 
  great question . 
  really great question . 
  you ask the best questions today . 
  the financial deficit is a yuuuge deal . 
  i go around campaigning and everyone 's asking ` what about the financial deficit mr trump ? ', 
  and i tell you , when it comes to this , i am your man . 
  i am a billionaire . 
  i know more about the financial deficit than 100 hillaries combined * ~ ~ [ cause i helped create it ] ~ ~ * and let me tell you that if i am elected , you will never have to worry about the financial deficit ever again . 
  guaranteed . 
  hillary will tell you that the financial deficit is a big deal , and she 's right , it is a big deal , and i 'm the man to fix it . 
  i will deal with it before you know it . 
  i am the best guy around for this job , you all know it . 
  absolutely the best . '', 
  this ... this is just disheartening . 
  in a 2015 poll , 41 % of his voters were in support of bombing agrabah ( the fictional city from aladdin ) . 
  ** not only were they certain that agrabah exists , but they were positive that it needed to be bombed !, 
  ** i do n't think that this type of us citizens are very much in touch with reality . 
  bombing a city or owning a lethal weapon is just something that happens in everyday life for them . 
  * half of the us citizens are voting for this guy . 
  my point exactly xd, 
  i get : why do the brits ... * drive on the left * drive on the right * drive on the wrong side apparently , fellow greeks are fucking confused when it comes to which side of the road british people are supposed to drive on , ** and ** which side * we are supposed to drive on * xd, 
  * precisely * . 
  * not hardly *, 
  europe !, 
  the undressing is just standard procedure, 
  libtards and their over-theenkeeng , ecks dee wake up sheeplezzz gunz are all we neehdz, 
  we need the equivalent of '' ` murica ! '', 
  for europe ... we need it direly, 
  `` you never know what theresa might do !, 
  d : '' `` oh wait she already did '', 
  as long as isis keeps focusing on central east and/or france , everything is fine , amirite ? 
  or for the `` i 'm going to be fine either way , why even bother '', 
  and drugs merely use good health as fuel for a better mood , 
  in a broader sense , yes . 
  but what i meant is they 're making good money off of us . 
  so they keep at it . 
  i do n't blame the germans for our major fuckups , but i do blame them for blatantly abusing them . 
  actually i do n't blame them , i 'm just pointing it out . 
  they 're just doing the best they can for their self-interest , i ca n't blame them for that . 
  i 'm more worried about the permanent loss that the country suffers from this . 
  i am completely fine with making strategic retreats when we have to , but being extorted out of our national property and for abysmal gains is ridiculous . 
  these are not temporary leash contracts , they are literally selling evrything we have . 
  in 100 years from now , the crisis will probably have subsided but we 'll never get back what we lost .
