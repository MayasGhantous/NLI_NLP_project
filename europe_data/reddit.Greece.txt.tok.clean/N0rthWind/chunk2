  even though the majority of citizens voted for corrupt parties for 50 years i do n't think the correct way to go now is to just give up on our sources of wealth , simply because we fucked it up completely in the past . 
  even if we fucked up real good , in 100 years from now these airports would have brought in more than 1.4 bil , so if you ask me , it 's still criminal abuse of our indebted state . 
  the only way to pay off such an exorbitant debt is to help the economy recover and grow strong . 
  i think that it is ** criminal ** to force the country to sell off its best assets to pay off the debt . 
  first of all , because they 're likely not nearly enough , secondly , because selling these assets puts us in even deeper shit since we ca n't gain from them , and thirdly ... in 50 or 100 years the crisis may or may not be resolved , but we 're never getting back what we sold . 
  and that 's exactly why they 're making us do it . 
  it 's basically ** exactly ** what gold buyers do to poor families . 
  nobody paid off their debts by selling their furniture and jewellery ( unless they owned a fucking treasury ) but they are often extorted in order to part ways with it , because the buyers profit . 
  so , for a start , i would recommend stopping this ~ ~ madness ~ ~ ( it 's not madness when it 's intentional so i 'll call it bullshit instead ) , not forcing us to sell anything else just because we have to do as we 're told , since that only deepens the recession anyway , and have an actual , functional strategy that will revive the economy first and then pay off the debts with the surplus . 
  also , not having a massive interest would help too . 
  i do n't think it 's exactly `` fair play '' for us to be expected to pay off a constantly ( and rather rapidly ) increasing debt within a timeframe that is actually decided by the debt owners , and having them act like it 's money we ought to have payed . 
  i do n't have the numbers right now but i 'm pretty sure the initial debt has been increased by more than 60 % due to interest alone . 
  is this how allied countries are supposed to treat one another ? 
  i mean , i can clearly see why they do it , but this is thinly veiled tyranny . 
  when a friend owes you money , you do n't ask for 60 % more and act like they it 's their fault for not being able to deal with it . 
  especially when our economy is artificially weakened , * precisely * so that we ca n't ever catch up to it . 
  but guess what ? 
  we can always sell a few assets to stay on-track !, 
  given the fact that tourism is practically our main export , they were performing the best they could . 
  still , even if they were underperforming , they are investments that would bring in much more money than 1.4 bil in the long run . 
  1.4 bil for all the major airports in the country is practically theft - fraport , the company that bought them , will probably start making more than that per year in like 3 years . 
  i 'm a student and i 've moved in another city for university . 
  my parents came by yesterday ( they had to go to the airport ) so they supplied me well . 
  my mom has raised me with some rather gourmet shit , for example this time she brought me boeuf bourguignon xd grandma is a bit more ground-state, 
  i actually drink only cappuccino , i despire frappe . ___ . 
  i ca n't tell if this is a joke or not . 
  guys , is he joking ? 
  oh my goodness we should organize a convention , my grandma is a one-woman-food-factory . 
  especially her pies and her dolmas are absolutely killer . 
  aaaaaaaaaaaaand now i 'm hungry . 
  numerous countries ( including mine ) have a racist nationalist pleb majority , do n't act so dumbfounded :p, 
  sadly this is tragically inaccurate , i happen to be the palest fucker you will ever lay your eyes upon . 
  i have light and heat sensitivity . 
  :( `` mediterranean complexion '' my fucking ass . 
  xd other than that \u0399 actually see all the people ( well ... the open minded ones :p ) of neighbouring countries as my brethren , especially ones that i share so much common cultural references with such as turks . 
  well technically they kiiiind of are stupid racists . . ? 
  many people voted `` leave '' because of strong xenophobic and/or nationalist sentiments . 
  well it * is * brighter there, 
  perhaps your military elites were actually on to something back in august . _ . 
  i mean , if yalanci dolmas were officially banned in greece i 'd definitely attack the government, 
  actually i 'm pretty sure many have second thoughts now . 
  you know , after farage pretty much said `` welp . 
  i lied about everything , lulz '' and resigned . 
  merkel is just doing her job . 
  of course , this is kind of ruining the cohesion of the eu , but she 's draining billions out of the country each year so i ca n't really blame her . 
  but it 's blatantly obvious that the policies that are enforced on us are not designed to help greece overcome the crisis . 
  i mean , at first i was not so convinced , but this is like what ? 
  the * fourth * time they fuck up , say `` oops , we publicly admit our proposed measures that we shoved down your throats did n't work at all ... * again * '' . 
  but since we 're still in debt , we ca n't just say `` okay this is bullshit , we wo n't take this anymore '' . 
  nope , we have to apply * their * proposed austerity measures again . 
  and again . 
  even though everyone knows they 're not gon na help . 
  and each time we sell a bit more of the country . 
  the most recent measures were a failure ( * quelle surprise !, 
  * ) but , `` oops lol '' , greece was forced to sell _ 14 of its biggest airports to a german company ** for 1 billion . 
  ** _ * oops * . 
  i wonder what will they demand this time . 
  no pensions at all , perhaps ? 
  and the economy will not improve at all , of course , even a 5 year old can tell this type of measures does n't help the markets recover . 
  because who could * possibly * imagine that forcing greece to give up some of its best sources of reliable revenue for just over 1 billion euros will * not * actually help paying off the 300b debt , am i right ? 
  honest mistake , people !, 
  then a year later someone will admit that the austerity measures did not have the expected results , but of course that just means we have to try something else . 
  i do n't want to be bitter here , and as a 20 year old guy who 's travelled a lot i am actually proud to be a european citizen , but i 'm going to take a wild guess and say that , in a 15 years when greece will be completely drained of any profitable assets ( probably including the archaeological sites and the islands ) , * suddenly * the latest austerity measures will work as if by magic !, 
  hurray !, 
  all thanks to the european reform mechanisms !, 
  sexuality , like all human desires , can only be expanded . 
  regression is by definition not compatible with things you like - either you have to fundamentally change , or them . 
  you * can * like new things and that 's largely a matter of personality and a decision to be open to it ( i * could * decide to be open and experiment with women , and there 's a chance i might actually like it - but i do n't want to ) but you ca n't `` unlike '' something you have already experimented with and decided ( or discovered ) that you like . 
  and shock therapy was not just a nazi thing . 
  it is literally happening as we speak , and rest assured it 's not voluntary . 
  a * gloriouspractice * !, 
  that ... does n't surprise me :p, 
  oh yeah , german connects all the words into one noun, 
  president of the toaster sounds nice . 
  `` not necessarily '' . 
  but , if we could hypothetically have the ` perfect ' left and the ` perfect ' right leaderships , i do think that things would be noticeably better with the left . 
  more human rights , better financial protection for the weaker classes , better environmental management , better education , emphasis on ethical progress * and * technology instead of `` ethical '' regression and unethical technology . 
  i mean , if you take the right and just modify these things it so that there 's equality , environmental consciousness , some financial protection for the unfortunate ones and decent education ... then that 's pretty much the left :p, 
  i think it was meant as in `` english-speaking media '', 
  ^ ( * what the hell are these words * ), 
  the article says that he supported '' * the use of federal funding to treat people `` seeking to change their sexual behavior . 
  '' * '' the fact that he did n't openly say the words `` conversion therapy '' and all that it entails does not mean it 's not what he meant or that he 's not in support of it . 
  i doubt he 's much of an lgbt ally . 
  ** there is no such thing as people seeking to change their sexual behavior . 
  ** we 're not `` born this way '' , scientifically speaking , but it ca n't just be changed or `` cured '' either . 
  also , it 's not something that pence will have to establish . 
  this is * already * happening in way too many places , all that pence has to do is show some convenient lenience/negligence , maybe approve some federal funding to help promote those obscure `` local religious activities '' or something , and that 's all that 's needed . 
  pence has also said smoking does n't hurt and that climate change is a hoax . 
  i do n't have to overreact to make him appear like a dangerous lunatic . 
  oh , i 'm sorry i 'm unrealistic for not acting as if strangers wanting to literally fry my brain with electricity because i fall in love with men is * `` not as bad '' * as wanting to put me in the fucking death row . 
  you 're right , i overreacted . 
  it 's not that bad . 
  while you plan out your honeymoon with your spouse , i get to be repeatedly electrocuted * instead of being murdered !, 
  * ai n't that a treat !, 
  but no . 
  no , you 're actually right . 
  because let 's be honest , torturing someone - sometimes until death - with the intention of permanently scarring their psyche and their body into being unable to fall in love ever again , is ** nothing ** like rounding them up and just killing them outright . 
  yeah , comparing the two would * certainly * be exaggerated and unrealistic . 
  the vp of the us has openly supported the funding of `` gay conversion therapy '' that tries to demotivate homosexual impulses by ** physical torture ** , such as electroshock combined with images with homosexual activity . 
  currently that 's not even illegal in several states .
