  do you still think it 's unrealistic ? 
   we each have our own tribe and must look out for our own . 
  this is my opinion . 
  this . 
  this is why europe is failing . 
  you saying `` immigration is ruining the country and i ca n't feed my kids so i 'd be willing to fuck gay people over in order to save myself , since their issue is ** not as important as mine ** . '', 
  but let me tell you , if you were trying to protect your family and you could n't even get married ( for no reason !, 
  ) , you 'd certainly think that 's important enough . 
  would n't you think i 'm a selfish piece of shit if i said `` well i 'm pretty well-off financially so i can afford to be overly-liberal in order to protect my family . 
  muslims creating problems to the poorer classes ** is not as important as me losing my husband and my children ** , so sucks for them . '', 
  trust me , statistically speaking you 're not the most privileged person in your country . 
  if enough people think like you , you will eventually get fucked over by someone else who 'd be willing to throw * you * under the bus . 
  it 's not `` them or us '' . 
  if you think that way , you 'll ruin your own life eventually . 
  the monster you are feeding is only controllable by the most powerful , and you can bet it will not stop at gays and immigrants . 
  being a fearful mother and using that as an excuse to give in to your baser instincts will only endanger your kids even more . 
  look at america - and things have only gotten started there . 
  hell , what if one of your kids is gay ? 
  reclaiming their rights to equality could take decades again . 
  how will you be able to tell them that you ruined their life because you thought it was `` not important enough '' ? 
  you 'd be surprised how easily things that you thought could never touch you , suddenly become your problem . 
  this . 
  as a gay guy , when i hear people say `` i 'm gay and i support trump '' as if that 's a * good * thing ( maybe they just wanted to feel the inclusiveness ? ), 
  i 'm like `` great . 
  good for you . 
  * good for everyone . 
  * have fun . '', 
  what 's happening to the world is tragic , but hell , it 's about time we faced some consequences for our stupidity . 
  want to vote against freedom , against equality , against killing each other , against ruining the planet not for our children anymore but for * ourselves * , want to vote against your fucking rights ? 
  ** good . 
  ** you were warned . 
  you remained ignorant . 
  now you 'll learn the hard way . 
  and sadly , as always , the poorer and the weaker will get it first , but it 's time they were held accountable as well . 
  our fucking housemaid is an immigrant ( not sure if she 's legal , she ' fucking terrible too but she needs the money ) low-key supports the far-right , criminal , blatantly neo-nazi party of greece . 
  if she 's so retarded , that 's totally on her . 
  but if she wants to ruin her life , it 's not my family that 's going to suffer first , cause a bit money makes everything easier . 
  it 's her son that 'll get deported , not me . 
  `` claims harassment . '', 
  muslims are just christians v2 .0 . 
  they 're everything radical christians are trying to become . 
  but the church is not forced to wed homosexuals . 
  the church is not trying to defend itself from being forced to perform a ceremony it does n't agree with , it 's trying to stop the * legal * component of gay marriage . 
  marriage has nothing to do with the church . 
  it 's like saying that if the church does not agree with the name you want to give to your kid , and they refuse to perform a christening , your child can not get legally named in the eyes of the state . 
  to clarify : ** religious rituals are purely decorative . 
  none of them hold any value legally . 
   then why not have a civil union ceremony ? 
  why get married in the church ? 
  if you do it in the church , it 's their house , their rules . 
  let us set this straight because you obviously are awfully misinformed . 
  * civil union is not equivalent to marriage . 
  it 's less binding contract in most countries . 
  ** all citizens are entitled to either . 
  ** * marriage is a civil right . 
  it 's a matter of the state , not the church . 
  ** if i go get married in a church without signing the legal documents required by the state , i am not married . 
  ** * the church can do whatever it wants in terms of religion . 
  i doubt anyone tried to force a homophobic church to perform a religious gay marriage ceremony . 
  * ** the church is not trying to defend its right to not perform the religious ceremony for gay people , it 's trying to stop them from getting legally married . 
  ** the ceremony is optional and irrelevant to whether you 're married or not . 
  atheists can still get married and * trust me , they do n't do it in churches . 
  and this is precisely why democracy is failing spectacularly in most western countries . 
  because way too many people have way too strong opinions about things they do n't know jack shit about . 
  excessive immigration has negative repercussions but that 's not because `` dem muslims are ruining out culture '' . 
  people who are stupid enough to believe that the problem is * muslims * and not * immigration * are not exactly the types that 'd really hold up or take part in a debate . 
  if someone can write hunderds of racist comments on social media but he ca n't take 5 minutes to open another tab and google some shit just to educate themselves before they spew vitriol , i do n't think treating them nicely will make any difference . 
  that 's just like saying `` white supremacists are bad but you ca n't just call them racist scum , you have to take it easy with them so they might learn '' . 
  well , they do n't * want to * . 
  should we just let them be then ? 
  equality has been one of their values since the revolution , though . 
  not sure which of those values le pen is supposed to be representing . 
  equality , liberty or `` brotherhood '' ( as in unity ) ? 
  she 's actively acting against freedom , equality and she 's * quite * the divisive factor . 
  that 's true . 
  i personally know many older people that have `` that cousin in australia '' or `` that uncle that lives in miami '' . 
  complete opposite from oppression ? 
  `` damn , those gays have been totally oppression-free for , like , 20 years !, 
  better take some rights away for good measure . '', 
  they would if they could . 
  in greece we have that as '' \u03a0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03c2 , \u0398\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 , \u039f\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 '' that means `` homeland , religion , family '' . 
  the essence of the ~ ~ far ~ ~ right hyper-conservative mentality . 
  i think the problem is that each country has its own economy but the currency itself is tailored to the pace of the most powerful economy . 
  we must decide that we either want a common currency and a unified monetary management - as if we were one country - or that each country minds its own business . 
  having each country mind its own economy but then setting unified goals and having a unified currency that applies to both germany and southern europe is absurd . 
  it 's like i go to work in switzerland , i have to deal with swiss prices and swiss taxes , but i get paid greek wages . 
  so this european constitution you speak of , should either turn the eu into the united states of europe , and thus tying us all together into one single economy and forcefully balancing it out ... or else it should completely dissolve the euro altogether . 
  i mean , i have nothing against adhering a unified financial system , as long as it functions like a country that is pretty much forced to genuinely help its ailing provinces and ca n't benefit from draining them . 
  but this situation where some countries are pulling the cart as fast as they can , and some others are being dragged in the dirt behind it , being told they 're being helped to keep up , really can not continue . 
  i agree . 
  so what do we do ? 
  do we struggle to save society while taking care of ourselves , or do we prey on the weaker and try to climb as high as possible during our ~ 8-9 decades of life , not caring about what we leave behind ? 
  yeah , with my ex boyfriend we had this joke about its instability , that any year now france is going to outright ban employment . 
  xd still , i 'm not fundamentally opposed to a german leadership . 
  however * this * is not a leadership . 
  this is literally a very profitable diplomatic and financial manhandling . 
  a * ger * - manhandling , if you will . 
  ^ ( i 'm so sorry . ), 
  i was just arguing with a trump supporter that said the women 's marches are `` hurting unity '' . 
  i think i 've heard it all for tonight .
