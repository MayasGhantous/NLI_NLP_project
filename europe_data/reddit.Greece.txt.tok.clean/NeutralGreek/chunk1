i know it 's a hollywood movie but i saw master commander with russell crowe last night and loved it `` let 's return home before the war ends , god forbid '', 
  same happened in greece, 
  arctic will be basically ice-free by summer 2050 , noaa study says - http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/12/4217786/arctic-ice-free-summer-2050-noaa-study arctic sea ice melting faster than expected , un report finds - http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4b1a2f64-2048-11e3-9a9a-00144feab7de.html#axzz2rccio6cb will it be to late until people realize that irreversible destruction of climate warming ? 
  majority of eastern ukrainians do, 
  stupid anti-russian propaganda bullshit i bet nobody here will say a word during brazil 2014 world cup , where special forces go into favelas and execute dozens of people a day , estimates of up to 100,000 children missing as they were picked up from brazil streets as to not portray a `` bad image '' and do n't get me started on the terrorist qataris who fund entire legions of jihadis in syria to behead christians who were awarded the 2022 wc, 
  eastern ukraine wants to join the russian customs union , i dislike the narrative that all of ukraine wants to be in the eu . 
  eastern ukraine , which is also the richest areas of ukraine has great ties with russia and they benefit each other immensely , and this russian customs union will be an incredible stabilizing event for them . 
  the issue is that western ukraine , which is struggling does not get the same benefits and wants to join the eu which might be a net positive for them . 
  simply if the protestors win , then eastern ukraine will want to secede and join the customs union , while if yanukovich wins then western ukraine will likely secede . 
  this is just what i have gathered from listening to both sides . 
  the greek macedonians after the death of alexander became the leaders of the greeks with the achean league to fight the romans for 200 years . 
  after the fall of makedon to the romans the idea of ethnic macedonian ceased to exist as the greeks mixed together , as the city-state structure was torn down and free movement of people was now possible by the time the byzantine empire came to be ... 
  there was no such thing as macedonian ethnicity , only greek people and greek-macedonian region . 
  1,000 years after alexander 's death the slavs moved into territory north of greece that had never been macedonian land ... and you say you are descendants from them ? 
  simply insane ... 
  greece and cyprus will veto until the eu ceases to exist ( and bulgaria ? ), 
  there is no `` shutting up '' on this issue, 
  never going to happen and greece will never bow down to pressure on this issue . 
  vice was bought out by murdoch recently , they are just another propaganda outlet in their arsenal, 
  rt is going to love this, 
  only music with instruments is `` sinful '' that is why the `` music '' you hear in this video is heavily edited male vocals , with tons of overdubs, 
  the most worrying aspect by far is that french and uk prisons are a breeding ground for extremist islamic ideology a muslim man will go to french prison a petty criminal and leave as a devout jihadist . 
  it 's going to be getting really bad soon , imo . 
  never underestimate an enemy especially when they have russian support, 
  iran has publicly said that an attack on syria is an attack on iran . 
  so yes . 
  you make it sound like syria would be a simple weekend exercise in reality it would have brought the world to the brink of ww3 and the 2nd cold war you should thank every politician who voted no, 
   `` earlier this week , a deserter from an extremist group in syria revealed that british fighters are going to syria to train and return to fight on home soil . 
    the former jihad fighter said : `` the british , french and american mujahideen [ holy warriors ] in the room started talking about places that they wanted to bomb or explode themselves in europe and the united states . '', 
  do n't give the swedes any ideas, 
  i really hope ukraine does not turn into syria situation . 
  but it looks like it will be , violence will be increasing every day now . 
  once the first shot is fired to kill a police officer , the civil war between western ukraine pro-eu/anti-russian rebels and eastern ukraine loyalist pro-russian/ethnic russian will begin . 
  i give it 4-6 months until you start seeing suicide bombers/car bombs in ukraine taking down government positions, 
  next you say water good for hand wash, 
  russian reporter gets hurt http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=ada_1390478165 ukrainian riot cop gets beat up in middle of war-zone http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=6ee_1390474916, 
  paladins are always the most op , in every game ever, 
  love this, 
  the syrian national council main opposition group wanted a democracy at the start of the war but only a handful of rebel groups even at the start of the war were aligned with them , the vast majority have always wanted nothing less than a sharia dominated syria and this has only increased with time to the point where all groups want sharia but differ on how it should be implemented and the snc is a complete joke now , they voted for their new `` president '' in an empty room with 20 people ... `` democracy '', 
  there is a 2nd video on that link which is intense also , includes a charge by the rioters against the police at 1:15, 
  the main issue i have with the eu is that the biggest countries ( germany/france ) particularly have the voting power of nearly 4-6 countries smaller countries each . 
  for a recent example that was posted here today `` greek beekeepers become latest casualty of eu '' `` recent european parliament vote on the issue of honey labelling has been described as a setback for greece 's beekeepers , favouring german companies importing large quantities of cheaper , lower quality honey from countries outside the european union such as canada and china . '', 
  what can greece do ? 
  absolutely nothing . 
  84 people died from great danish lego avalanche of 1978 - rt, 
  more like organized mafia , do not under-estimate these people by calling them bandits . 
  say what you will about the american-italian/russian mafia 's tactics but they have a potent power structure that leads to success, 
  don ; t use the term `` serbocroatian language '' . 
  the last time a croatian person here went on an insane angry rant because of it, 
  i guess this means cheap ( er ) prices for japanese vehicles in turkey ? 
  hoepfully this also benefits greece also with cheaper japanese cars, 
  greek honey is treated like medicine by the locals , not food , literally medicine . 
  that is how potent and good it is . 
  i remember reading about the famous ny times article `` where people dont die '' http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/magazine/the-island-where-people-forget-to-die.html?pagewanted=all the locals all have 1-2 spoons of local honey every morning to start their day , they attribute that as one of the main reasons they live so long . 
  greek yogurt ( fage brand ) + greek honey mixed in is my favorite breakfast by far also . 
  big surprise that a eu decision benefits germany and fucks over greeks . 
  no surprise , uk has become nothing more than a us proxy, 
  spain is the most at risk of being fascist their current ruling party view franco as a hero for example , them putting harsh fines for protesting is a bad sign and most worrying are the two major independence movements gaining momentum that could trigger a civil war and fascist rise to power golden dawn will always be a marginalized party, 
  eu project goal : by 2030 every eu country has minimum of 50 % of all energy needs by a combination of wind/solar/geothermal / hydro by 2050 95 % minimum is from these sources, 
  i lost all respect for france when they supplied billions of $ worth of weapons to the terrorists government of saudi arabia and france has been the loudest voice in trying to take down assad so that islamofascist genocidal maniacs can take over that country they do not fight for liberty , freedom or justice . 
  they only want to support their own military industry and destroy countries for profit, 
  i think he was likely trying to toss away a flashbang and it blew up in his hands someone here said that the riot police are duct-taping pieces of metal and screws around the flash bang to cause injuries , so it is possible he picked up one of these, 
  fsa is not democratic , they have never proclaimed anything other than wanting sharia law 2nd new official un reports that came out this week are now saying the rocket that fired the chemical weapons was a piece of junk homemade rocket that could not have been fired from government controlled areas ... combined with the fact that rebels were caught with sarin shortly before the attack you can put 2 +2 together the fsa openly blame the west for losing their power in syria because they did not set up no fly zones and they will commit attacks as `` revenge '', 
  greek exports 2012 vs. 2011 by type : food : +9 % fruit & ved : +15 % beverages : +4 % tobacco : +15 % livestock feed : +20 % raw materials & semi-finished products : +61 % ( ! ), 
  ores & minerals : +25 % industrial products ( various - total ) : -2.1 % ( the only declining area ) other : +15 % ( for oil products there are no data for 2011 to compare ) link : http://dir.icap.gr/acci/exports_by_commodity_item.pdf ( from comment section ) greek politician sentenced to life imprisonment for embezzlement : is athens really cracking down on corruption ? 
  - http://www.ibtimes.com/greek-politician-sentenced-life-imprisonment-embezzlement-athens-really-cracking-down-corruption greece plans tax evader prisons - http://greece.greekreporter.com/2013/01/28/greece-plans-tax-evader-prisons/ head of greek tourism association sees 2013 as record year for visitors - http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_18/04/2013_494597 russian/serbian tourism is booming in greece and 2013 was an all-time record . 
  . not just since 2008 how is the tap deal insane babbling you fool ? 
  you really are clueless about geo-politics/investment and global economics ? 
  let me give you a hint . 
  the tap deal is the biggest thing to happen in greece possibly ever . 
  the tap will be the backbone of the greek energy sector and the fact you consider it `` babbling '' just shows how idiotic and clueless you are . 
  at least take a few minutes to read on the tap deal before spouting your stupidity here . 
  and no i am not kissing samaras ass . 
  he has not been perfect but can you not respect him for something so major ? 
  the tap deal was very nearly going to be given to albania/fyrom but samaras some how won greece the deal . 
  the tap pipeline will be fully realized for its importance a decade from now and you will understand what i mean . 
  until then you can continue spouting your hatred . 
  `` haha '' is a pathetic counter-point . 
  greece sitting on natural gas reserves worth $ 600 billion in crete - http://digitaljournal.com/article/334152 600 billion is minimum number . 
  . potential for trillion but it will take a decade to know the true amount rest of greece is being explored by norwegian contractors - `` updated : vast gas reserves offshore greece '' - http://www.naturalgaseurope.com/greece-natural-gas-reserves note that the contractors doubled their research size after early positive findings . 
  again it will at least take 5-10 years to know the true amount http://qz.com/67069/the-tech-scene-in-greece-is-booming-thanks-to-desperation-and-60-youth-unemployment/ eric schmidt of google : athens can become a mecca of technology - http://greece.greekreporter.com/2013/10/10/eric-schmidt-of-google-athens-can-become-a-mecca-of-technology/ lots of google conventions/ted conventions are taking place in athens recently . . with new initiatives such as giving free office space/phone/internet to new tech start-ups and easing up entry to start a tech business , there are very positive trends all i will add is that i do not think samaras is perfect . 
  if someone better came along with a better plan i would love to vote for him/her . 
  the fact is that right now we are on the best course possible for the moment . 
  the only other option is pasok 2.0 aka syriza/tsipras . 
  i have never seen someone talk so long in a horrible mono-tone droning voice for 30 minutes and give no substance . 
  all i hear when tsipras talks is populist bullshit aka austerity bad !, 
  troika bad !, 
  etc x1000 . 
  he has no plans and sounds like someone who has no fucking idea how world economics/business/investment works . 
  if pasok 2.0 wins greece will lose all the progress it has made the last 4-5 years and go back to square one with no plan and building an economy on sand again . 
  samaras is playing the game , greece has no other options but to follow the current course . 
  slowly build up our economic base , build tourism and investor confidence ( which it is ) and then the combination of tap + gas drilling we will be able to dramatically decrease our debt and commit to growth programs . 
  it 's easy to criticize greece but i believe is on the correct course at the moment . 
  greece has only just emerged from a great depression greater than the america one of the 1920 's . 
  exports have dramatically improved between 2011 to 2013 and the trend is continuing . 
  greece has posted its first surplus in a decade recently . 
  a new tax and corruption agency created under eu direction and many high profile cases have been seen already . 
  tourism is breaking records every year after many thought it was destroyed in 2008 crisis . 
  samaras greatest moment is when he secured the tap ( trans adriatic pipeline ) which when completed ( 2016 ) will make greece the # 1 energy pillar of the eu . 
  1 trillion minimum of gas found by crete already and norway explorers have found trillions more with drilling beginning around 2020 .
