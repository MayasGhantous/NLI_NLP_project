  it goes up or down from momentum and `` indicators '' . 
  what this us investment firm did is going to have more results on the greek economy than a million words from merkel . 
  because words are just words . 
  when investors from all over the world see this it will start building incredible momentum because that is how investment/trading works also this us firm is not some `` irrelevant '' investment group , they are one of the most respected groups in the entire world because they are 100/100 when it comes to winning form investments . 
  they have made four investments since 1990 , the way they work is that they wait for years studying/reading trends etc and they perform a surgical strike of an investment when timing is perfect . 
  from their four previous investment they have become incredible wealthy and respected . 
  this is their fifth investment in almost 23 years and they are confident it will be a winner again . 
  this is why this news is of major importance , especially in the investment/trading world . 
  how is this government propaganda ? 
  this statement is from an american investor who is speaking about why his american company invested over 5 billion $ into greek bonds . 
  i saw him speak during a live interview and wanted to share this . 
  he was very passionate on his stance and he obviously knows what the hell he is talking about . 
  not some piece of shit like you who cant stand anything positive about greece, 
  http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/03/us-greece-bonds-japonica-idusbre9920ui20131003 kazarian said greek bonds , which japonica had bought for as little as 11.4 percent of par value , were currently massively undervalued because of `` pervasive systemic misperceptions '' about greece and obsolete accounting rules that overstate its debt-to-gdp and fiscal deficit . 
  the country 's debt is worthy of single a + credit rating , he said . 
  credit rating agency moody 's considers greece 's debt far more risky and gives it a `` junk '' rating of c. `` what many of the best and the brightest think they know about greece , in an investment context they are almost certainly wrong , '' he said on the call . 
  he predicted that the bonds ' price would exceed 85 percent of par value next year , far higher than where they trade today .

  al-nusra is the syrian arm of al-qaeda - they are being directly supported , funded and trained inside turkey there are videos of buses full of terrorists going from the turkish side of the border into syria to go fight in syria , they are believed to be going directly to the kurdish areas of syria and damascus/aleppo battle, 
  it is banned in catalonia correct ? 
  i read that a while ago i believe, 
  funny how turkey supported al-qaeda/al-nusra/isis with billions of dollars in weapons , massive acres of lands inside turkey to train for the last two years . . but now that the rebels are losing and about to be crushed they back-step because they did not expect assad to win . 
  turkey is now realizing that their policy of arming , training and shipping thousands of terrorists a week to go fight in syria to destroy kurds/syrians is going to hit them back in the face when the terrorists are now holed up all over turkey and pissed off , armed and trained . 
  . and now europe ( mainly uk/france/germany ) is going to be flooded with these `` jihadists '' . 
  erdogan is about as tact and strategic as bush junior, 
  why do you assume anyone other than spaniards find bull torture acceptable ? 
  you know something is true if there is a person in a white lab coat in a commercial, 
  i do n't see why it would be the end of the world if uk leaves the eu , they are not in the euro currency so that is not an issue . 
  uk will still always be europes eternal ally , i think they have proven this countless times in the past . 
  enough bribes and they will vote for australia to join the eu, 
  it is obviously `` islamophobia '' . 
  not that a a bunch of crazed religious zealots are mugging/abusing people on a london street to fund a `` jihad '' across the world . 
  the same jihad they want to bring to the uk and the rest of europe . 
  a `` phobia '' is used to describe a fear that is disproportional to the actual danger it poses . 
  also i did not say he did or did not deserve to die , all i am saying is are you capable of saying that to the victims face . 
  that he was a mis-guided soul to be forgiven . 
  tell that to his victims, 
  all 20 people in luxemburg have banking jobs, 
  what really gets me about what he said is not specifically the joke itself but the way he said it . 
  in that very cold , straight-face way a bully would do in the school playground on the little foreign kid . 
  it seems this guy has not grown up from a child and is still trying to pick on kids as an adult you can say a stupid slight-racist joke like that if you deliver it perfectly and with honest good humor and not malice behind it this was 100 % malice , you could see see the hatred in his eyes . 
  siesta is also great for people with their own business from my experience in greece start work 8-9 then take a break when it is hottest during the day to take a rest , eat and just relax then when you get back to work around 3-4 you can work until 8-9 with no problems . 
  most of the people i know in greece who close down their business during siesta hours is because it is the slowest time of business in the day and also they can rest which allows them to work later into the night during the busiest hours of foot traffic . 
  so instead of the traditional 9-5 business hours , many small businesses go 9-12/1 few hours break then start around 3/4 and go into 8/9 . 
  the good thing about real estate is you can physically inspect it yourself before putting money down , also 5,000 $ is not much of a risk either way check to make sure plumbing and electricity works and basically all risk is out the window if they are fine . 
  wrong , there is more wealth than ever before in history corporations are making insane profits while workers have only had their standard of living lower while corporations keep making record profits year after year . 
  there is no political will to make changes that will benefit the lower/middle class at the expense of the corporate oligarchy because all politicians are part of the corporate structure themselves . 
  that is like asking a police officer to write himself a speeding ticket , never going to happen . 
  50 % of voters do n't even bother in most countries because of how disillusioned they are , elections in modern age are between shitty choice 1 and very slightly less shitty choice 2, 
  yes i realize there are more than two parties , there are just two parties that are capable of winning just like democrats and republicans in usa they will go foaming at the mouth at `` moral '' issues like birth control , homosexual marriage , euthanasia etc because they want to portray the image of being at opposing sides . 
  but when it comes to wall street , banks , military industry they are one party and one team . 
  the moral debates are to fool the masses , same thing happens in almost every country . 
  we are all being played for fools . 
  the issue is that there is no such thing as two parties , there is one party , the business party , two faces of the same head . 
  one party wins , the other party criticizes changes being made that benefit the business/wealthy class and fuck over everyone else next election the people choose the other party since they critisized they then go to pass laws that benefit the business class while the other party criticizes . 
  etc until people realize that we are all being fucked, 
  i think there are 1-2 backup torches at all times , one of the torch bearers swam through a river this week so not surprising if it goes out once in a while, 
  tzatziki is traditional greek dish , turkish has similair dish but tzatziki is a bit different like many things like gyro-kebab there are similair foods in the balkans + turkey but each country has their own unique twist to the ingredients and/or way of making it, 
  pope : `` u wot m8 '', 
  because all whites are evil racist pricks who should be ashamed of their history and culture and non-whites are the beacon of light in this filthy white-infested world . 
  / s for those with ass burgers, 
  the same guy who personally assisted in sending over 500-1000 uk born residents to syria to become trained in weapons and explosives . 
  he has sown the seeds for what he inevitably believes is a religious war in the uk, 
  i prefer to buy my shoes in teaspoons, 
  remember when china invaded iraq and afghanistan based on a lie ... oh wait, 
  `` greece dropped the euro would benefit the rest of the eu . '', 
  the entire point that greece was forced to join the euro was so that they were forced to pay for european ( german primarily ) imports in the euro and not the drachma the last thing germany wants it greece to leave the euro and start paying for german goods in the drachma, 
  here is a comment someone made in worldnews thread about this i just saw this and could n't believe it . 
  i traced back the source ( s ) this article : original article : http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-11-25/greek-tragedy-half-new-greek-hiv-cases-are-self-inflicted-receive-\u20ac700-month-benefit claim : `` half of new greek hiv cases are self-inflicted to receive $ 700 per month benefits '' citation / who report : http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/215196/review-of-social-determinants-and-the-health-divide-in-the-who-european-region-final-report-eng.pdf claim : `` hiv rates and heroin use have risen significantly , with about half of new hiv infections being self-inflicted to enable people to receive benefits of 700 per month and faster admission on drug - substitution programs . '', 
  citation / lancet article : http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/piis0140-6736 ( 11 ) 61556-0 / fulltext #bib 22 claim : `` an authoritative report described accounts of deliberate self-infection by a few individuals to obtain access to benefits of $ 700 per month and faster admission onto drug substitution programmes '' citation/report group : http://ewsd.wiv-isp.be/rapid%20communications%20%20extra%20information/report%20of%20the%20greek%20fp%20expert%20group%20-%20aids.pdf original statement : `` an additional factor the committee believed worth considering is the well-founded suspicion that some problem users are intentionally infected with hiv , because of the benefit they are entitled to ( approximately $ 1,400 every two months ) , and also because they are granted `` exceptional admission '' to the substitution programme . 
  it is well-known that the substitution programme has a long waiting list and that the waiting time can be over 3-4 years . 
  drug users with a severe chronic condition jump the queue and are admitted in a short period of time . '', 
  it 's like a very bad game of telephone . 
  more subs, 
  i like the gr-2014-eu part but i agree with the odd shaped sail boat they could have done better with that, 
  usually when someone immigrates to a country , they work hard , learn the language , follow the laws aka the complete opposite of what 99 % of `` immigrants '' do when they arrive in greece, 
  these reports do not ever make stats based on race/ethnicity etc . 
  i guarantee you 99 % of these people doing this are `` immigrants '', 
  [ in regards to the economy and greece 's image , after six years in recession and three years of tough austerity to avert the risk of default , athens aims to highlight the positive signs that the crisis is near the end and greece is no longer a country in crisis , he said . 
  `` it is of major importance to us to show the progress achieved , '' venizelos underlined . 
  `` greece will represent over the next six months a european union which must show its belief in great values , such as solidarity , and a growth model which will safeguard that we will not live similar crises , '' he added .

  most of those things are n't even that odd supermarket is not a social experience , the quicker the better do n't dress like a slob . 
  this is a good thing do n't say `` how are you '' when you dont give a shit , i hate this , i would rather you say nothing then give me a false sense of caring . 
  if you can not sit for 5 minutes and actually talk do n't ask . 
  speak the language . 
  this is nice . 
  when an english tourist comes to greece and talks greek in horrible accent we find that nice of them and we respect that do n't smile or act like a creep by staring at woman/kids . 
  this is natural for all humans nothing in that list is weird to me at all , this should be normal for most people, 
  yeh , best part is that its so easy to make and very cheap all you need is some greek yogurt for main ingredient i recommend fage ( fa-yeh ) brand, 
  if they are top-less ( bras are sexist ) , i 'm ok with that, 
  instead of ketchup with fries you should try out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tzatziki with fries it is like eating a piece of heaven with each bite , you can easily make it home-made in like 2 minutes heres recipe - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gooan1axsyq, 
  good point , it is actually very cheap to eat healthy i can go spend 10 $ at mcdonalds on a bunch of chemical filled fake meat and i will be hungry again a few hours later and feel like crap for 10 $ i can easily feed 2 people healthy meals for the day, 
  do you plan to have someone in every bathroom inspecting you while you pee ?
