it 's as relevant as the northern part of cyprus being occupied for over 40 years , while the world pretends the republic of cyprus has dominion over the entire island ...

  interesting that the bulgarians were the ones to oppose south stream and the burgas - alexandroupolis pipeline ( that bypassed ukraine ) citing environmental concerns * while actually protecting us interests and costing greece millions of euros in investments already made . . 
  yet now they stand to freeze due to their own actions and expect greece to share lng that is used to cover domestic demand ...

  not funny ? 
  i thought you guys had a sense of humor ... 
  what you say does make sense . 
  german exports might indeed benefit more if the euro was not such a hard currency . 
  on the other hand , export to whom ? 
  it seems to me that most german products are consumed by other eurozone members and by the us . 
  since the us can not impose protectionist policies against german products and us products generally have a higher production cost , reducing the value of the euro itself seems to produce little benefit . 
  regulating the value of the euro has been done in the last 5 years by making announcements regarding the progress ( or lack thereof ) of economies of other countries within the eurozone . 
  need to drop a bit the value of the euro ; greece is not meeting its targets . 
  need to raise the value ; spain is doing better . 
  and so on . 
  printing currency would immediately alleviate pressure from the economies of those countries , making future currency manipulation more difficult . 
  why give that up ? 
   you were thinking of the bundsbank , germany 's central bank . 
  that seems to be who is setting ecb policy . 
  * seems to be * is the correct term . 
  i personally have no doubt that government policies have always been `` guided '' by corporate greed in all `` democracies '' since the 19th century at least . 
  hopefully one day we can all follow iceland 's example and achieve true democracy in our own countries ... 
  deflation can always be countered by printing a bit more money ( and not even conventionally , electronically will suffice ) . 
  but deutsche bank will never ok this ...

  any downsize does n't seem to affect [ these guys though ... ] ( http://www.generaldynamics.com/news/press-releases/detail.cfm?customel_datapageid_1811=19335 ), 
  even if it is downsizing , it 's a fact that [ congress did this ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/congress-forcing-the-army-to-make-tanks-2012-10 ) in the same time it was gifting usable tanks and vehicles to greece ; and now is shipping them to norway . 
  this equipment is essentially going for cold storage ( pun not intended ) abroad . 
  the us is not really planning to ever use this equipment again . 
  not 2 years past , the same equipment [ was offered to greece ] ( http://usa.greekreporter.com/2012/04/04/american-tanks-to-help-greece-free-of-charge ) for free ( the greek government would only have to pay [ about $ 11m ] ( http://www.defensenews.com/article/20111207/defsect04/112070307/greece-considers-free-tank-offer ) for transport ) . 
  the germans did not like this , since it would diversify the equipment of the greek army leaving greece less dependent on germany ( most modern tanks in greece are leopard ) . 
  so greece ended up not taking them of course , using the transport fee as an excuse ... 
  the us wants to get rid of any older equipment it has [ in order to be able to justify ordering new equipment so as to keep the defense industry in the us occupied ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/28/abrams-tank-congress-army_n_3173717.html ) ( lobbyists do good work ) . 
  so , off to norway they go , to be parked and left to rot . 
  the correct answer : there is a transitional government of technocrats ( not politicians ) in greece at this moment , due to imminent elections that were triggered by the resignation of former prime minister alexis tsipras . 
  the transitional government does *** not *** have a mandate to make policy decisions and the only solution was to abstain . 
   switzerland too . 
  they have the money . 
  but do they have big enough lakes ? 
   papadopoulos was forced to resign by an internal coup ( ioannidis ) exactly because of the polytechnic uprising . 
  ioannidis used the polytechnic uprising * as an excuse * to place papadopoulos and patakos under house arrest . 
  the extent of the involvement of the latter two in the brutal crackdown is disputed and , if i am not mistaken , those two were not charged for * that * particular crime . 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/athens_polytechnic_uprising ) : `` in addition , hundreds of civilians were left injured during the events . 
  ioannides ' involvement in inciting unit commanders of the security forces to commit criminal acts during the athens polytechnic uprising was noted in the indictment presented to the court by the prosecutor during the greek junta trials and in his subsequent conviction in the polytechneion trial where he was found to have been morally responsible for the events . '', 
  there is a conspiracy theory that papadopoulos did not want to continue supporting eoka-b and that * this * was the reason why ioannidis usurped him . 
  with an even more tragic result .

  it is easy to disregard the true substance of politicians when times are easy . 
  they are good thespians and give nice performances that the people take as fact . 
  it is when times get hard that their nature becomes apparent . 
  they only care about themselves and being in office until next wednesday , all the while making sure they will have a golden parachute when people stop voting them . 
  just search for retired politicians and the speech circuit ...
