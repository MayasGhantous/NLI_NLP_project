  how is this my fault ? 
   whataboutism is n't a great foundation for a conversation , i 'm sure you understand that . 
  whataboutism is about equating things that are not similar . 
  this is not the case here . 
  this is about comparing two defaults that were both brought about from the irresponsible actions of these two respective countries . 
  and today 's generation in each respective country is equally responsible ( or not ) for the actions of those that went before them . 
   ok let me get this straight . 
  because i 'm german i inherit the guilt of ww2 and therefore am not allowed to make a point that does n't guilttrip myself ? 
  that 's hilarious . 
  in order to have a meaningful conversation , it is good to first agree on a few points : a ) germany was responsible for starting ww2 , yes or no ? 
  b ) greece was responsible for knowingly over borrowing , yes or no ? 
  c ) germany defaulted on their debt in 1953 because of actions they themselves were responsible for , yes or no ? 
  d ) greece defaulted ( effectively ) on their debt in 2010 because of actions they themselves were responsible for , yes or no ? 
   because we germans ** totally avoid ** the fact that our nation started the war back then . 
  he says sarcastically  besides that 's not even the point . 
  oh , the irony ... 
    next you 'll be telling me it was right for turkey to invade cyprus ...  well , if you have actually read [ the treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_guarantee_ ( 1960 \\ ) ) , you 'd knew that ** they were ** *** explicitly *** ** within their rights to invade ** . 
  now , ** the occupation starting with the second campaign ** *** is *** ** a violation of the treaty ** , but that still does n't mean they had no right to invade in the first place . 
  exactly . 
  it is so frustrating to hear many of my fellow greeks argue falsehood and discredit themselves by not acknowledging simple facts . 
  the ( first ) turkish invasion ( let 's call it ** `` attila 1 '' ** or ** a1 ** ) , was triggered by the attempted coup ( ** b ** ) against the legitimate cypriot government ( ** c ** ) and perpetrated by nationalist greek-cypriots ( ** d ** ) that were backed by the illegitimate ioannidis military junta government of greece ( ** e ** ) at the time . 
  so , ** e ** helped ** d ** to overthrow ** c ** , a government elected by all the people of cyprus and comprised by both greek-cypriots * and * turkish-cypriots , through illegitimate ways ( ** b ** ) and this gave a valid reason for ** a1 ** to happen . 
  ** but ** , unfortunately , turkey was not satisfied by the restoration of the democratically elected government of cyprus . 
  they had their own agenda , an agenda as dubious as that of the greek military junta . 
  whereas ** `` attila 1 '' ** ( ** a1 ** ) happened justifiably , with little loss of life , and resulted in occupying merely 3 % of the island , ** `` attila 2 '' ** ( or ** a2 ** , that happened several weeks later ) was totally unprovoked , cost the lives of thousands of people and resulted in the occupation of roughly 40 % of the entire island . 
  the junta in greece had already fallen immediately after ** a1 ** , hostilities within cyprus had ceased and those who attempted the coup were arrested , and talks were underway ; when turkey invaded the rest of the area ( ** a2 ** ) , it was totally unexpected and unlawful . 
  those two events are separate and should not be lumped together . 
  would you mind terribly posting a source for this ? 
  also , assuming what you said is accurate , portugal had not taken those measures ** on top of other measures , ** put in place already * 5 years ago * and that have brought about a lasting economical depression ... apples and oranges . 
  http://www.tovima.gr/files/1/2015/06/26/gr%20proposal.pdf these measures were designed to bring the equivalent financial targets as the ones by the troika , but with less painful measures to the most helpless portions of the greek society . 
  why not endorse those instead ? 
  is it maybe because some friends of their friends will lose money ? 
  money they would otherwise have gained on the expense of the greek taxpayer ? 
  experts from the proposed deal to the greek government :   ( 26 june 20h00 ) list which takes account of the proposals of the greek authorities received on 8 , 14 , 22 and 25 june  adopt legislation to reform the vat system that will be ** effective as of july 1 , 2015 ** . 
  the reform will target a net, 
  sure there are people who got scared and are getting cash ; but should 7 people waiting at an atm prove a bank run ? 
  just because ** there were 7 people ** that got it in their minds to withdraw their money at 2am ** in an area of athens that 50.000 + people live ** ???!, 
  wow !, 
  less than 10 people waiting in line at an atm in the heart of athens ( a city of 4.000.000 + people ) . 
  headlines !, 
  read all about it !, 
  always a good idea to `` kick 'em while they 're down '' ... what could possibly go wrong ? 
  you know from personal experiences ? 
  [ away with you , pesky troll !,

  i guess the americans made the distinction between `` nation '' and `` ethnic group '' clear ( linguistically , in american english at least ) with the [ pledge of allegiance ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pledge_of_allegiance ) which states :  `` i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of america , and to the republic for which it stands , ** one nation ** under god , indivisible , with liberty and justice for all . '', 
  since it is clear that the usa is a multi-ethnic country , the logical conclusion would be that the meaning of the word `` nation '' is not completely synonymous with what we consider to be an `` ethnic group '' ( as in the kurds , the greeks , the albanians , the koreans - northern and southern together - , the aboriginal australians , the native americans etc. ) . 
  this modern definition in american english ( not sure about the british english present day definition ) of the word `` nation '' , is probably very skewed when compared to the loan word from which it originated ; but this is the case with very many loan words and even more pronounced when done via a third language : nation ( n. ) c. 1300 , ** from old french ** nacion `` birth , rank ; descendants , relatives ; country , homeland '' ( 12c . ), 
  and directly ** from latin ** nationem ( nominative natio ) `` birth , origin ; breed , stock , kind , species ; race of people , tribe , '' literally `` that which has been born , '' ** from natus ** , past participle of nasci `` be born '' ( ** old latin gnasci ** ; see genus ) .

  would you please ask him about some obscure portuguese fact in portuguese and see if he answers you ? 
  this felt more like a sponsored add that an informative video ( as it is * portraited to be ) . 
  like something marlborough cigarettes might make in the 70s to `` inform '' people of how there is nothing wrong with smoking ... 
  before testtube makes a video about historical events , they should try opening a history book first . 
  if they ca n't be bothered , they could try wikipedia even . 
  leaving * out the fact that alexander the great [ was ethnically greek ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_the_great ) for instance is a tad misleading at the least ...

  all i get is [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/20mkmb4 ) followed by a never ending loading screen ... 
    the turkish construction itself states that all citizens of turkey are by definition turks  yes , modeled after france . 
  i am quite certain that france * does * recognise the ** fact ** that french nationals are members of different ethnic groups . 
  as does the us and the uk . 
  but does turkey ? 
  and if yes , which are the major ethnic groups within the national turkish population ? 
    and since in turkey exist a lot of different ethnic groups and a lot of people with mixed ethnic ancestry , it is ludicrous to speak of the turkish nation as if it was a uniform turkish ethnicity . 
   i personally do n't think so . 
  towards the end of the ottoman empire the majority of people living in turkey were primarily turkish speaking and most of the balkan immigrants were turkish speaking ( like ataturk 's family ) and so were some of the caucasus immigrants . 
  my fathers ' fathers ' parents were both born in what is modern day turkey and both spoke turkish ( \\* albeit as a second language but at a mother tongue level ) and that still did not make them ethnically turkish . 
  they were ottoman nationals and ethnic greeks . 
  do you mean to say that in turkey today there are * no * turkish nationals that are ethnically non-turkish aside from :  however there were also non-turkish speaking balkan peoples and caucasus peoples who immigrated to turkey and became assimilated . 
  how would you categorize kurdish people living within the borders of turkey then ? 
   erdogan 's ancestors for example are from georgia , though i do n't know if they were turkish speaking or georgian speaking . 
  erdo\u011fan is clearly a case of someone whose family was assimilated . 
  but are there no people still living in turkey who have * not * been assimilated ? 
   unless you are making a reference to historical assimilation , as in how christian anatolians became assimilated to the turkish identity over time ? 
  in my opinion i do n't think it would be fair to call that `` mixed ethnic ancestry '' . 
  ** all major ethnic groups today are the culmination of similar historical assimilation . 
  ** do you mean globally ? 
  regionally ? 
  please explain more . 
    what it is in fact ( i.e. 
  present day turkey ) is the continuation of the ottoman empire restricted in size . 
   i agree that turkey as a country is the continuation of the ottoman empire , though the ethnic diversity of turkey is nowhere near the ottoman empire 's . 
  what is in your view the present day ethnic diversity of turkey ? 
   we can not rely on all-or-nothing responses in governance . 
  at some point the principle of proportionality comes into play . 
  many measures have to be weighted against each other before you can make an informed decision . 
  ** and since taking children away from their parents is an extreme measure , the requirements should be steep . 
  ** so it would be nice to know what those requirements in these particular cases in norway actually were . 
  and i would be interested to know if you personally would agree whether or not they ( meaning those specific requirements used in those specific cases in norway ) should constitute reason for taking children from their parents . 
   still : i do n't think that open and indubitable abuse should be the only permissible cause for an intervention . 
  in these general terms you have set , neither do i. 
  but do you believe that children should be taken away from their parents in cases where `` open and indubitable abuse '' is not established to be in evidence ? 
    what is your opinion about vmro / u/dessertstormmyass ? 
   populist party , similar to the european variants in the social conservatism side but ultimately appeal to the patriotic hardworking ordinary citizen a bit like a balkan version of the uk conserative party or true finns in finland somehow i do not see timo soini erecting a statue of [ magnus iii ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/magnus_iii_of_sweden ) in the middle of helsinki ...   did the vmro government set this up the way george w. bush , dick cheney , and condi rice arranged for 9/11 ? 
   dude i have to be blunt now becasue ** your understanding of the author is clearly lacking ** and thats why you are so confused , the fact you ca n't ** read the sarcasm in that line about macedonian trutherism ** just goes to show * you * *** have *** * the proper command of english to fully understand and take anything of value from it * and now i see it probably confused you more than anything . 
  having read all four parts of the `` article '' you posted , i can confidently say i understand * exactly * what the author wants to convey : that the vmro government is the best thing the people could possibly have . 
  and i strongly disagree . 
   for me i like gonzo journalism where i can weigh up the mindset of the reporter , get into the story ( and their humor ) ** try and work out where he comes from on the political spectrum ** and then personally judge his findings based on that , i see it was obviously not your thing , maybe you should find something better to recommend the op instead of getting mad at me though  the author clearly is as far right as the ragan administration was at least . 
  the ** nixon ** administration more likely .
