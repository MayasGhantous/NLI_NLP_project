  please expand on your opinion . 
  the turkish construction itself states that all citizens of turkey are by definition turks . 
  and since in turkey exist a lot of different ethnic groups and a lot of people with mixed ethnic ancestry , it is ludicrous to speak of the turkish nation as if it was a uniform turkish ethnicity . 
  what it is in fact is the continuation of the ottoman empire restricted in size . 
  some experts from the `` article '' :    since the elections of april 2014 , sdsm has been boycotting parliament , ** claiming that vmro cheated at the ballot box . 
  ** conservatives say that ** these boycotters are simply crybaby losers who are n't used to being out of power . 
  my impression is , this critique is right . 
  ** wow . 
  such objectivity ...    listen to another conservative complaint , and a legitimate one , i think : the `` sorosoids '' have the advantage of informing the rest of the world about macedonia . 
  they are `` well networked , '' in the words of one conservative . 
  ** and they portray a vmro-governed macedonia as a country sliding out of democracy and into a right-wing darkness . 
  ** so , this is what the westerner reads and hears . 
  what is * your * opinion about vmro / u/dessertstormmyass ? 
     i say to a conservative , `` look : you 've won ** nine straight elections . 
  ** you 're creaming the left . 
  how influential can soros be ? 
  he 's evidently wasting his money . '' the conservative gives me a most interesting answer : ** `` these are our reagan years . 
  ** we 're riding high , yes . 
  but the left is planting seeds all over . 
  they are burrowed in , everywhere : classrooms , newsrooms , you name it . 
  at this rate , they will own the future . 
  and our liberal-democratic progress will be lost . '' brute honesty about what they really are ...    this country is now in the midst of a huge wiretapping scandal -- not the first in its brief history ( 24 years ) . 
  ** the charges and countercharges are byzantine ** -- dizzying -- but i will write a few lines about them . 
  pardon my brevity . 
  *** a proper reporter would write tens of thousands of words . 
  *** good to know the mind of the author of this `` article '' ...    days after i leave , fighting breaks out in kumanovo . 
  shots are traded between albanian militants and macedonian security forces . 
  over 20 are dead . 
  the left says that the government plotted all this , to distract from the wiretapping scandal . 
  ** is this a kind of macedonian trutherism ? 
  did the vmro government set this up the way george w. bush , dick cheney , and condi rice arranged for 9/11 ? 
  ** #fuck off already, 
   so : i ** would n't ** demand that parents must be ** intentionally abusive ** to allow for ** a measured state intervention . 
  ** slippery slope right here . 
  what next ? 
  breeding licence ? 
    the `` article '' you linked gives no information about what has been happening during the last few weeks ,  as i said it gives a ** background ** into the politics , culture and history . 
  the op asked ** specifically ** about the ** current ** political problems . 
    the words albania or albanians appear a grand total of 4 times while greece or greeks appear 14 times and usually in a disparaging tone . 
   it 's the first of four other parts ... it 's long and in depth , you only read 1/4 of it i 'm thinking so why did you not link to the appropriate part ? 
  is there an appropriate part at all in that thing ( based on what the op asked ) ? 
    this looks like an attempt to shift the discussion from what the op wanted to know to something the government in skopje would prefer people discuss . 
   yea sure it 's all a big conspiracy with national us publications on board , skopje has no doubt bought out the us press / s what you are trying to do here is a failed attempt at [ reductio ad absurdum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reductio_ad_absurdum ) . 
  i only blamed * you * and * your biased `` source '' * , not all news sources in the us . 
  but sure , fight dirty . 
   finally , the children are taken because barnevernet thinks it is in their best interest not to become perfect little brown norwegians . 
  this sentence confused me ... 
  i think what you meant is : `` finally , the children are taken because barnevernet thinks it is in their best interest ; * they are not taken in order for them to become perfect little brown norwegians . '', 
  please consider editing !, 
  well said . 
   finally , the children are taken because barnevernet thinks it is in their best interest not to become perfect little brown norwegians . 
  not to be assimilated . 
  the children are taken based on their situation not their `` whiteness . '', 
  racism can have many faces . 
  i most certainly would never say that norwegians discriminate based on skin color but this situation does seem to indicate that they do discriminate based on life choices . 
  please do not misunderstand , if the parents of all those children that got taken away were in fact abusing them then the authorities clearly did the right thing . 
  but it seems to me that the children were taken away from their parents because the authorities simply disapproved on the manner of the childrens ' upbringing . 
  which is discriminatory ( therefore in some interpretations racist ) and a slippery slope ... 
  the `` article '' you linked gives no information about what has been happening during the last few weeks , as the op requested . 
  the words albania or albanians appear a grand total of ** 4 ** times while greece or greeks appear ** 14 ** times and usually in a disparaging tone . 
  this looks like an attempt to shift the discussion from what the op wanted to know to something the government in skopje would prefer people discuss . 
  what is the  macedonian arguement please explain ? 
   what do n't you agree with ? 
  i do not agree with people writting `` articles '' that represent their personal opinions as fact . 
  seems a lot like this : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stolen_generations, 
  take what you read with a couple grains of salt ... 
   * whats with the greek connection ? 
  from the `` article '' : `` the airport in macedonia is called `` alexander the great . '' ** that is a middle finger to the greeks ** . 
  they think that ** alex ** is theirs , period . 
  another middle finger exists in the center of skopje , the macedonian capital . 
  it is a giant statue of ** alex ** . 
  ** the government ** , a conservative government , ** has been making over skopje , on neo-classical lines . 
  there is the alexander statue . 
  there is the porta macedonia , a local arc de triomphe ( sic ) ** . 
  there are monuments to sundry independence figures . '', 
  stress in parts from me . 
   i do n't imagine many governments would like going to court with an 85 % chance of being told * they 're in the wrong * - that would crush their chances in the long run i think . 
  you are confusing justice with * perceived * legality . 
  the greek government simply concluded that there is no justice to be found in the courtroom and decided to not pursue the matter there . 
  itt : a * lot * of people who do n't give a fuck if another war is started in europe and all the lives lost fighting it ... 
  [ definitely ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/34mmcy/z/cqwekzp ) just you . 
   the ** difference ** is that he sees written agreements as legal binding and thus does n't sign things he ca n't sell at home . 
  a tad vitriolic would n't you say ? 
   it 's from 2005 , statistics probably changed a lot since then . 
  ah , yes . 
  of course . 
  it * does * take a * bit * of time for * new scientific discoveries * to be accepted by people as fact ... 
   [ not to sound cold or racist ] ( https://youtu.be/dcei8hs9ku4?t=20s ) ... 
   or what about the bombing of my country 's capital that was not a threat at all and was forced into collaborating with the germans but never participated in any major battle and was begging for peace ? 
  bombing of [ sofia ] ( https://www.google.bg/search?q=firebombing+of+dresden&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=gf88vbxzhsjrap7ggnab&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=965#tbm=isch&amp;q=bombing+of+sofia ) [ eat shit fuckface ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/axis_occupation_of_greece#the_bulgarian_occupation_zone ) . 
  yup . 
  greece would have fallen a lot faster if jugoslavia had joined the axis instead of resisting . 
  in fact , the fortified greek positions across the border to bulgaria were never fully taken in battle but ordered to surrender after the germans invaded through present day fyrom ( indefensible position ) . 
  as to the futility or not of greek resistance , here 's what * hitler * had to say about it : [ for the sake of historical truth i must verify that only the greeks , of all the adversaries who confronted us , fought with bold courage and highest disregard of death . 
   what did you mean that people refer to you as turks when something positive is said though ? 
  never heard about that before , is it a balkan thing ? 
  primarily , [ but not exclusively ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-greek_sentiment#western_europe ) . 
  try googling `` greeks are turks '' and see what you get ... 
  i think he 's referring to ancient athens . 
  it 's funny what i noticed , when there is a negative aspect of ancient greece to be discussed ( such as some of the [ shortcomings ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/33qvbi/what_do_you_think_about_direct_democracy/cqnkydr ) of direct democracy ) * then * we are the descendants of our forefathers .
