     ** and yet [ germany ] still have [ sic ] higher emissions per capita than poland ** which is constantly criticised for using coal and having high emissions . 
    poland has done a lot better at reducing carbon emissions than it was expected to , but still germany [ did better ] ( http://imgur.com/pmor0ax ) . 
  there really is nothing negative to be said on german carbon emission policy . 
   re-read my post . 
  you clearly do n't understand what i said . 
  i 'm not saying anything bad about german carbon emission policy nor anything about change in emissions , but rather actual , current emissions . 
  it sounded to me that you were pointing out that poland is being criticised for using coal while simultaneously not praised for having less carbon emissions * per capita * when compared to germany ( which gets all the praise for turning to green energy sources ) . 
  was i wrong in thinking this ? 
  what did you actually mean if not this ? 
  poland has done a lot better at reducing carbon emissions than it was expected to , but still germany [ did better ] ( http://imgur.com/pmor0ax ) . 
  there really is nothing negative to be said on german carbon emission policy . 
  germany [ has been doing more to decrease co2 emissions than most countries in the world ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kyoto_protocol#projections ) . 
  while the us has basically done the opposite . 
  so fourst , fifnd and sixrd ? 
  yeah , thanks . 
  maybe they should have asked the public for some ideas , [ like a contest or something ] ( https://youtu.be/19fcn3vaxs4?t=20s ) ... 
  what 's really wrong with threeth ? 
  or twoth ? 
  or oneth for that matter ? 
  well , not that far anyway !, 
  european side ? 
  i 'd like to visit one day , my parents went a couple of years ago and had a great time :-), 
  huh , did n't notice that . 
  i was browsing the page and i guess i was at that point when i copied the link . 
  seems that the city has been growing recently , are you from that region by any chance ? 
  actually , the pipeline will probably go first through turkey and enter greece over the evros river south of [ edirne ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edirne#etymology ) . 
   what makes the village turks `` people of the empire '' ? 
   the ottoman aristocracy were so disgusted by them they did n't even refer to themselves as turks . 
  ** lest we forget that turkey fought to gain independence from the ottomans , just like everyone else . 
  ** oh now you are just being obtuse : `` around this period , the cup 's relationship to the armenian genocide shifted . 
  early on , armenians had perceived the cup as allies ; and the beginnings of the genocide , in the 1909 adana massacre , had been rooted in reactionary ottoman backlash against the young turks . 
  [ but during world war i , the cup 's increasing nationalism began to lead them to participate in the genocide ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/young_turks#1914.e2.80.931917_period:_armenian_genocide ) . '', 
  russia is * literally * the second world . 
  the third world means not allied to the us ( the first world ) or to russia ( the ussr to be exact - the second world ) . 
  thanks for the info !, 
  how do you call people from north korea ( who incidentally also happen to be ethnic koreans as well ) ? 
  could you give a bit more information on this ? 
  the history part of the naming dispute was there starting from the collapse of jugoslavia . 
  that is why kiro gligorov made [ this statement ] ( https://youtu.be/rsmvsx3eufm ) in the early 90s . 
   i did n't feel i should take letters from different script and compare them to latin ones , even if there is somewhat of a correspondence . 
  first of all , good job with the latin based languages !, 
  seems to have taken you quite a bit of time compiling that information . 
  second , i quess my main objection comes from the title that the op of * this * submission chose : `` consonants in european languages ( ** full ** list ) '' . 
  if it would be `` consonants in latin based languages in europe '' , i could not find fault in it . 
  third , i quess you excluded my home town of thessaloniki and part of north greece by mistake in the first picture [ here ] ( http://m.imgur.com/a/ctopb ) , but could you tell me what those small circles in the north west of greece seen at every picture represent ? 
  i am not aware of any population in greece that uses those consonants like that . 
  thank you for your time and i hope you include the greek alphabet fully in the next iteration ; feel free to ask any questions you may have on the subject or anything at all , i would be happy to help .

   interesting enough , this all happened during the last 3 months . 
  for almost a year those people were safe . 
  now , this * is * food for thought ... a ) were these guys * safe * for almost a year ? 
  had they been attacked / threatened during this time ? 
  if yes , by whom ? 
  b ) were these guys * there * for that entire period of time ? 
  were they moving around ? 
  c ) if brought to trial , * who were those * that had anything to fear from what would be revealed ? 
  why would they fear ( if for example they had fled the country ) ? 
  d ) is there something that happened three months ago / during the last three months that has changed the previous situation and could connect these 8 men ? 
  lots of questions , hope we someday get some reliable answers to them ... 
   which is basically [ inflation ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/russia/inflation-cpi ) which has basically [ remained at the same level ] ( http://imgur.com/8r8hnzj ) for the last 15 years ... 
     it 's [ byzantine history ] arguably more important than that of the history within the current borders of greece . 
    probably yes . 
  but remember that you are comparing an empire that lasted 1000 years ( and at one time controlled the entire mediterranean ) , to a 200-year-old nation-state not even 1/10 the size ...  that nation-state has a 4000-5000 year history though . 
  my main point was i suppose that there 's more overall cultural success to be seen in the byzantine empire era than any other in greek history . 
  ah , you meant it like that ... well , if we take the ethic perspective , it is easy to see why greeks can not claim the * entire * history of the east roman empire as * solely * our own . 
  it was an empire not started by greek people ( unlike alexander 's empire ) and the cultural mark that it left to the world is not characteristic of any one particular ethnic group by itself ( unlike the one made before the roman conquest ) . 
  the east roman empire began after the entire greek ethnos ( all people greek ) had already been part of the roman empire for over 300 years ; it was made by emperor constantine , a roman ( latin ) national , and ruled by latin emperors for [ almost another 200 years ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/justinian_i ) ; the shift to a [ less latin based empire ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heraclius ) was gradual and the emperors thereafter represented every ethnicity within its boarders ; in fact , very few of the emperors were greek ethnically and despite the fact that the * lingua franca * of the empire being greek for a long time , the feeling amongst ethnic greeks at the time was stronger in that they were romans ( citizens of new rome ) rather than being greeks ( a term which was at the time associated with being [ pagan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/twelve_olympians ) instead of christian ) . 
   i guess i just had n't noticed a strong sense of pride in that from greeks . 
  i 've always wondered if they see themselves as distinct from anatolian greeks/pontians . 
  i am of pontian descent myself ( 3/4 in fact , and 1/4 from thessaly ) and in today 's greece there is virtually no distinction made between greeks as to their place of origin . 
  naturally the traditional music and traditional dress varies between the greek `` tribes '' as preserved in the present day but they are all accepted as part of the collective greek cultural heritage . 
   problem is we want the land , not the people on it and people throw a fit when you work it out . 
  yeah , * probably * an inopportune day to hint at genocide kardasi ... 
   interestingly , the popularly revered greek instrument , the bouzuki , is [ originally ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bouzouki ) from the greek population of asia minor . 
  the bouzouki is probably originated from the [ pandura ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pandura ) , which has also , allegedly , been the precursor to the italian [ mandola ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mandola ) and the kretan [ laouto ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=%ce%ba%cf%81%ce%b7%cf%84%ce%b9%ce%ba%cf%8c+%ce%bb%ce%b1%ce%bf%cf%8d%cf%84%ce%bf&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;biw=120&amp;bih=107&amp;tbs=lr:lang_1en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=4ksvvbvhgogiyao88ihgbg&amp;ved=0cacq_auoag ) . 
   i 've always felt that the greeks do n't emphasize enough nor remember their rich byzantine cultural development and history . 
  that is not entirely true . 
  apart from being a big part of our historical education at school and covering a major part of the theological education as well , the cultural impact of that era is still felt today in the language of everyday speak , the music , perceptions etc. 
  but i guess it is more subconscious than intentional ...  it 's arguably more important than that of the history within the current borders of greece . 
  probably yes . 
  but remember that you are comparing an empire that lasted 1000 years ( and at one time controlled the entire mediterranean ) , to a 200-year-old nation-state not even 1/10 the size ... 
  in the words of pliny the elder ( 1st century ad ) : `` the tympanum is [ an instrument made of ] skin or hide stretched over a hollow wooden vessel which extends out . 
  it is said by the symphonias to resemble a sieve , but has also been likened to half a pearl . 
  it is struck with a wand [ stick ] , beating time for the symphonia . '', 
  sounds pretty similar to me ... 
  in fact the only real difference is that the dauli is double sided and made portable . 
  natural evolution . 
  sure , the davul in particular could very well be considered as turkish . 
  but it 's not like there were n't any [ similar drums in asia minor ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timpani#etymology_and_alternative_spellings ) a thousand years before the turkic tribes came to the neighborhood ... 
  from the article : * he was described by the [ french ] foreign ministry as `` one of our best diplomats '' . 
  * you would expect that one of their best diplomats would be wasted serving in such an insignificant post . 
  this statement serves only as a confirmation that the french foreign ministry are just being dicks . 
  such an accomplished diplomat deserves a much more elevated position , for example ambassador in saudi arabia . 
  why do n't they try sending him there ? 
  edit : just to clarify , i made this comment to point out that the french would never * dare * to pull a pr stunt such as this if they would think there would be actual consequences . 
  this is due to the fact that the sms system was created based to the ascii character system . 
  there are no greek characters in the ascii so people writing in greek had to use [ greeklish ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greeklish ) instead .
