  with the utf-8 system and subsequently , greeklish are mostly not used out of necessity any more but just out of habit . 
  [ in greek ] ( http://imgur.com/mcs5bta ) [ in english ] ( http://imgur.com/4nclrv7 ) notice the number of characters available in both cases . 
  this was an example of every-day-speak , between a couple of teenagers . 
  english literacy is quite high in greeks under 30 years old . 
  to be perfectly accurate , that sentence , if actually written down , would look like this : `` o cyclops einai kalyteros an8rwpos apo ton wolverine '' instead of '' \u039f cyclops \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ac\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd wolverine '' since most young greek people use [ * greeklish * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greeklish ) when texting due to character limitations of the sms system . 
  hyv\u00e4 yst\u00e4v\u00e4 , the submission is called '' ** consonants in european languages ( full list ) ** . 
   yeah . 
  but in some ways it 's accurate . 
  a letter like ` g ' of ` r ' is not part of the greek language , so a correct pronunciation does n't exist . 
  the [ letter `` r '' does not exist in the * modern * greek alphabet , but the letter '' \u03a1 '' does , named `` rho '' , ] ( http://www.webtopos.gr/archives/languages/greek/alphabet/chart_gre_anc_alphabets_cities_1369x1301_tr.gif ) and [ it is pronounced in the same way ] ( https://youtu.be/sjipxv8ncqs?t=2m48s ) . 
   similarly , the finnish language does n't have a proper pronunciation for the letter ' \u03b2 ' , beyond just calling it ` beeta ' . 
  sure you do , you just use the letter `` v '' instead , as in `` v\u00e4vy '' or `` vuori '' . 
   and ** it is n't a full list ** anyway , it does n't include all consonants , like 's ' or ` b ' . 
  exactly my point . 
  the op should not have called it a ** full list ** on the otsikko . 
   the first map in this list works as a disclaimer , and regardless , the linguistic research is impressive so no need to be so negative about it . 
  there is a tonne of complaints about this submission from every country in europe . 
  which means that the `` linguistic research '' is far from impressive . 
  edit : [ some ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/32npv3/consonants_in_european_languages_full_list/cqcxn0t ) [ examples ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/32npv3/consonants_in_european_languages_full_list/cqcx1r8 ) [ of the ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/32npv3/consonants_in_european_languages_full_list/cqcwye1 ) [ complaints ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/32npv3/consonants_in_european_languages_full_list/cqcx7kq ) [ made ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/32npv3/consonants_in_european_languages_full_list/cqcxgh5 ) . 
  if that were true then the submission should not have been named `` consonants in * european * languages ( * full * list ) '' . 
  while it is true that there is no letter `` c '' in the modern greek alphabet , [ that was not always the case ] ( http://www.webtopos.gr/archives/languages/greek/alphabet/chart_gre_anc_alphabets_cities_1369x1301_tr.gif ) ; although in ancient times the letter corresponded to modern day '' \u03b3 '' , which sounds like the consonant part of the letter `` y '' as in [ `` yoghurt '' or `` yellow '' ] ( http://www.phonicsontheweb.com/y-roles.php ) . 
  when the letter `` c '' was re-introduced to greek during the early days of the eastern roman empire ( byzantium ) , it was done so as a substitute to the consonant `` s '' as in `` sit '' or `` sorry '' . 
  for example , the name of `` jesus christ '' in greek is '' \u0399\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 '' , [ abbreviated to `` ic xc '' due to this phenomenon ] ( https://egolpio.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/ihsous_xristos12.jpg?gccfxdorequest=1 ) . 
  in regular modern day greek , the letter `` c '' is not used as all , except when a foreign word is used verbatim in a sentence , as in '' \u039f cyclops \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 * \u03ac\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 * \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd wolverine '' , which translates to '' [ cyclops is a better * person * than wolverine ] ( https://awritershailmarypass.wordpress.com/tag/character-assassination/ ) '' . 
  whoever compiled this information lacks basic knowledge of modern greek . 
   you mean dumb voters . 
  nope . 
  he means the financial institutions ( both governmental and private ) that are profiting from the current situation . 
  the only thing the dumb voters get is [ schadenfreude ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schadenfreude ) . 
  nerds got you to the moon though ... 
   unfortunately , i see no reason to be optimistic concerning reforms in the euro zone architecture . 
  which is the saddest part . 
  it 's like watching a train wreck on slow motion ... 
  so what you are saying is all prostitutes have chosen to become prostitutes ? 
  would you become a prostitute to feed your children ? 
  so international politics are really not unlike a group of high-school girls ... 
  til !!, 
  thanks !, 
   dude , you do n't seem to understand what the fuss is about , he is talking about ` reset ' with russians and forgetting the past and at the same time demands war reparations for wwii . 
   i fear that the realities of running troubled country overwhelmed them , and observed from distance , the seem to be running amok . 
  tsipras was specifically talking about resetting the relations between the greek government and the russian government , ** nothing ** else . 
  where do you even get all that ? 
   part of their debt is issued under british law , they will have a hard time getting it written off ( cue argentine ) this is very true , i would only correct by saying that * most * of the debt is currently under british law , not just part of it . 
  after greek pm papandreou formally asked for financial help from europe in 2010 , all the greek debt ( that used to be in greek government bonds under greek law ) had to be transmuted to bonds under british law as a ( really reasonable from a european standpoint ) condition for the loan . 
  that means serious legal problems for greece if bankruptcy becomes the only choice left . 
  the deal stated specifically that any legal disputes have to be settled in a court in belgium under british law . 
  not at all favourable conditions for greece . 
  and this is from where the varoufakis middle finger video comes from : before 2010 , the debt was under greek law and any legal disputes would have to be resolved in greek courts . 
  that is not to say that the lenders would never see their money back again but they would definitely be forced to accept a great deal of new bonds with a later date on them ( effective default ) . 
  greece could have easily done this against the loans it had gotten mainly from french and german banks and be in little to no legal problems , effectively giving the finger to the french and german governments that would then have to bail out their banks all the while legally unable to do anything to greece . 
  greek debt against nations at that point in time was miniscule and the entire greek budget deficit was because of loan payments . 
  greece would not need to borrow money ever again if this had happened . 
  immoral ? 
  yes , absolutely !, 
  practical ? 
  bet your ass it would be !, 
  but the greeks did not choose to stiff europe with the bill and now here we are today . 
  still being called immoral ( fml ) . 
   the part of debt they can not simply annihilate will rise with the depreciating currency because it was denominated in eur this is the biggest problem with a grexit . 
  the new currency would never rise enough to make repayment possible . 
  that debt would stay with greece till the sun turns to a red giant . 
   without assistance of the ecb , they will have a hell of a time salvaging their banking system - the loans the banks have given out will be redenominated into their new soft money whereas the loans the banks took out will mostly/partly stay in eur this is going to be so ugly i do n't even want to think about that ...  they would have a really hard time getting new loans on the international markets try impossible . 
  it 's not the fact of the bankruptcy itself , it 's the fact that the defaulted loans would never go away ( since they are now under british law ) . 
   i have read but never really understood the claim that an exit from the eur would also imply an exit from the eu . 
  in the wikipedia page you referenced , it is stated that the ecb made a legal speculation based on current eu law . 
  in the same article it also says that there are those , like jens dammann , who speculate the exact opposite . 
  and the legal speculation is made from a hypothetical unilateral greek withdrawal from the eurozone . 
  at this stage , if greece is to exit the eurozone , it would have to happen with the concent of the other member countries . 
  and this would probably involve the creation of a legal background to handle the operation . 
  since the only people in greece who want to exit the eu altogether are the neo-nazis and the communists , it is highly unlikely for greece to ask for a simultaneous eu exit together with a possible eurozone grexit . 
  and i doubt it would be in the interest of any other eu member country to want a greek exit from the eu . 
  if you believe i am wrong in this , i would like to know what would the benefit , of a greek exit from the eu , be to any other eu country ( assuming greece already left the eurozone ) . 
  if you speak german or greek , [ this explains the situation through comedy ] ( https://youtu.be/_qimxvuiczu ) . 
  if not , [ here is the gist of what is said ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/31rttl/german_economy_minister_calls_greek_war/cq57r7o ) in english . 
  and [ in this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/31rttl/german_economy_minister_calls_greek_war/cq56pnm ) , you can read some counter-arguments about the nature of the satirical show and the reliability of the facts discussed there . 
  hope this helps . 
  out of context much ? 
  ^ but please , do n't let me interrupt your circlejerk ... from the article : `` 5h ago14 :59 a major part of ** greece 's relations with russia ** is tourism . 
  greece is one of the most popular destinations for russians . 
  last year greek resorts and other attractions were visited by one million russians . 
  the greek pm alexis tsipras thanks putin for his hospitality . 
  we have discussed in detail how we can ** boost greek exports to russia ** , covering the huge negative trade balance . 
  and how we can ** attract russian investment into the greek economy ** ... branches such as tourism , infrastructure , and how we can further strengthen our cultural , scientific , educational , academic exchange ties . 
  ** i once again want to say how important it is to restart and to forget the past . 
  ** '' nowhere in the entire statement , ** which was the opening statement of the greek-russian relations talks ** , was russian-eu relations mentioned . 
  but this matters nothing at all to anyone here i guess . 
  ( continues )  [ here something nice my greek friend , well as much as this can be `` nice '' : / ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtax3fl-uzo ) there are a few sad truths you should be aware about the story in this video : a ) the greek pm at the time was a fasist dictator himself . 
  he had no choice but to deny `` earth and water '' to mussolini since the greek people would not have it and his own generals might have ousted him had he tried . 
  not to mention the british who had him on a short leach . 
  b ) the regular italian soldiers did not fight hard against the greek soldiers ( unless in mortal danger ) and would always try to surrender . 
  this was not because of cowardice but because they did not believe in attacking greece . 
  a notable exception were the black cloaks ( the italian equivalent of the ss ) , who fought hard and took no prisoners they did not need . 
  very few of these survived albania . 
  c ) the german soldiers fought the hardest and to the last man , never seeming to question their orders , from the spring of '41 when they invaded through jugoslavia till the fall of '44 when they left . 
  people seldom spoke of acts of kindness from any of them . 
  this has given an impression to the greek people of thinking about the germans as if they were machines rather than people . 
  i am aware it is an unfair and inaccurate perception to have against an entire population of people but ... 
  i hope we can all get past our preconceptions against one another . 
  peace . 
    ah , i thought i was speaking with a rational individual for a moment there .
