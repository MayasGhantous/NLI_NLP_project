   thanks  sorry about that , but from the tone of what you wrote before it felt i was dealing with another npd troll from / r/european . 
  glad to hear you are not one of those . 
    the germans who would find it funny would also most likely be of the liberal spectrum so i extrapolate that you are probably centre-right in your political views . 
  correct me if i am wrong . 
   i will , i am on the left . 
  but i do n't have to agree with everything the left does . 
  true , but also remember not to keep double standards . 
  i am not accusing you of doing so ( at least not deliberately as we often do things subconsciously ) . 
  it is always good to put yourself in the other person 's shoes for a moment before passing judgment . 
    the problem is that the reforms imposed by the troika have not helped greece at all during the past 5 years . 
   yet the entire political establishment of europe was singing praises for samaras and his government and pre the previous greek government was fucking up with the program ? 
   strangely enough other nations were able to get back on the track . 
  well , first of all , define getting back on track . 
  how much has their real debt decreased ? 
  how much has their budget deficit decreased ? 
  how much has their gdp grown ? 
  are they in better shape now than greece is now ? 
  yes of course but greece was in worse shape that they were in 2008 as well . 
  and what works for someone with prostate cancer may not work for someone with stomach cancer that has spread to the intestine as well ... 
  different cases must be treated in different ways . 
  i am not saying that greece could not have done more in the last 5 years to combat corruption and tax evasion but the politicians in power at that time were the same people who have ruled greece since 1974 resulting in the present situation . 
  why did europe object so loudly when we finally decided to get rid of them ? 
    there was not a single greek government from the 1950s till the 1990s that did not ask for reparations . 
  you are either ignorant or a liar . 
   but never this loud and aggressively . 
  and now it just feels like populism . 
  not as if he genuinely cared about it . 
  i am happy you are not a liar . 
  the eu was built on the promise of solidarity . 
  one european peoples , coming together to put the past behind and move to a peaceful future of prosperity . 
  or at least that was on the cover of the advertisement . 
  people in greece fell for it and chose to let the government use quiet diplomatic ways to resolve the reparations issue . 
  when the shit hit the fan though , everyone was quick to blame the lazy greeks for their predicament and remind them of their `` moral obligation '' to pay their debts , with the loudest of them coming from germany . 
  this type of doublespeak does not sit well with the greek mindset . 
  we know we are owed a debt we were not repaid and yet the same people who still owe us shout the loudest that we should pay our own debts . 
  this is a valid premise for a farce . 
  imagine if your grandfather came into my grandfather 's house , killed him and then burnt the house after raping my grandmother ; and then some years later my father joined a company and borrowed some money from a group of people that included your father and never paid that money back . 
  and then today you are shouting at me that i owe you money all the while without anyone ever giving any compensation for the burnt house and nobody going to prison for the murder and rape . 
  and the craziest of all is that this tale ** is not far off from what ** *** actually *** ** happened ** . 
    germany is not the eu . 
  this issue is not greece vs the eu . 
  none of the other eu members did to greece what germany did during ww2 . 
  the italians occupied almost half of greece between 1941 and 1943 and never made remotely as many war crimes as those done by the nazis . 
   still brings up the question , why only germany ? 
  why not italy aswell ? 
  there simply are not any evidence whatsoever of large scale atrocities committed by the italians during the occupation . 
  none . 
  sure , some women must have been raped or at least forced to have sex with italian soldiers for a piece of bread and sure , the italians must have executed ( no more than ) a dozen people they suspected to be in the resistance . 
  but never whole villages to the torch and every villager to the grave . 
  and they never forced a loan that would amount to 90 billion euros due today in and of itself . 
    so have a little respect and be more careful with what you say about matters like that . 
   as long as german tourists are n't served , as long as german flags are burned and merkel is called a nazi . 
  why should i give you respect ? 
  i am not getting any respect anywhere because everyone calls me a nazi . 
  wherever i go this stigma is with me since forever . 
  why should i give respect back ? 
  i was attacked because i am german , i was called names because i am german . 
  do you think this is funny ? 
  i am sorry you were treated that way . 
  would you mind telling me where it happened ? 
  who were the people that did this ? 
  you mentioned the rise of right-wing parties in germany lately and i can tell you i was very concerned as to how much the greek neo-nazis would get before the election . 
  thankfully they still remain low , but so was hitler in 1928 ... 
  it would be a sad day indeed if the people of greece would ever feel so abandoned as to actually consider voting for gd , in much the same way the germans did in 1933 . 
  i used to place my political views in the centre-right spectrum of politics but was disillusioned by 2006 when no charges were made by karamanlis to a very ill government system . 
  sad to admit for one who opposed a lot of what syriza was about , tsipras may be the last hope greece has before falling pray to gd . 
  and god save us then . 
    is n't this a threat ? 
  and are n't you one of those who would vote those people ? 
   i am stating facts . 
  nothing more . 
  if you thing i will vote these people you misjudged me . 
  i apologize to having misjudged you . 
  unfortunately , since too many politicians around europe have chosen populistic rhetoric to avoid dealing with the problems of their own countries , people have once again started thinking in terms of national and local interest before european interest . 
  and when nationalistic sentiment is cultivated in the quick and easy `` us vs them '' terms instead of the `` i love my country and those who live in it in peace '' terms , what you get is extremism . 
  a sad day for all of europe . 
    i know all this will fly over your head  thanks for calling me stupid , because i have a different opinion . 
  this surely helps to solve conflicts  again , i am sorry to have confused you for something that you are not . 
   let us take some anger out of this . 
  the reparation payments may be 100 % correct , but they are brought up in a bad time . 
  the reason for the bad timing ( from the perspective of greek goverment officials making public statements ) is the fact that the majority of the people who are part of the current government * never before held public office other than a seat in the parliament * . 
  they have been saying these things for decades but before now the only ones who could hear them from outside of greece were the ones who could tune in the parliament radio ...  but you should consider , that reparations towards common people wo n't bail out the state and reparations towards the state wo n't make peoples life better . 
  these are two different things . 
  the forced loan alone , theoretically payable directly to the greek treasury , would amount to approximately 90 billion euros . 
  that is about 15 % of the total debt of greece , no pocket change . 
  also , any financial compensation to the families of the victims of war crimes would greatly alleviate the pain these people feel today due to the recession and unemployment . 
  this would actually be the moment when they could use this money the most . 
   i would like to see greece working again . 
  but in the end , reparations and the debt crisis are two different things . 
  but now they are represented as one . 
  which is n't true at all . 
  this was brought in the foreground mostly by the accusation that the greek people are immoral to not be able to pay back the money that they borrowed . 
  this is the true meaning of irony to greek ears , to be called ** immoral ** for not paying back his father 's debt * by the family of the people who have not yet paid their own grandfathers ' debt to him * . 
  granted , this family has already payed ** a lot ** of the debt of their grandfather but almost not at all * to him * . 
  and it is him they call immoral . 
   i feel bad for the millions of people that survived but never got anything in return , but using them to solve this crisis is n't right . 
  we are in full agreement . 
  the crisis should be solved by first of all trying to avoid a humanitarian crisis ; by making sure the hospitals can run efficiently ( not forcing the greek government to cut medical staff and medicine ) ; by making sure people have enough food to eat ( not raising vat to the highest percentage in europe ) etc. 
  in other words , sit down and make a new plan that works . 
   i do n't know how to solve this crisis but i am still entitled to my opinion .
