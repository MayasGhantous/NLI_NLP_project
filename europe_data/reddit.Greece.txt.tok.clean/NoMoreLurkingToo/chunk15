  you are not . 
  ** the same way that i am not entitled to an opinion on how to perform a triple bypass heart surgery ** . 
  the only people entitled to such an opinion are economics experts that do not have vested interests in the matter . 
  precious little of these i am afraid , same as the doctors who can preform a triple bypass . 
  ( continues below ), 
   you know , time efficiency and all that . 
  not that a greek would have the first idea what that means or why anyone would find it useful . 
  you have already proved to us you are an asshole , you need not try an longer you know ... 
  ah , i thought i was speaking with a rational individual for a moment there . 
  this reply is not addressed only to you but mostly to people who legitimately want to know more about the situation . 
  ok , let 's look at what you say point by point . 
   yes , it 's unfunny and stupid . 
  a matter of opinion . 
  i found it funny and cleverly made and i am sure a lot of germans did as well . 
  you are clearly not one of them . 
  the germans who would find it funny would also most likely be of the liberal spectrum so i extrapolate that * you are probably centre-right in your political views * . 
  correct me if i am wrong . 
   this whole segment with the restaurant . 
  what do they want to tell me ? 
  that it 's my fault that greece made debts ? 
  or that it 's my fault that greece got poorer ? 
  they want to get across the message that the current generation of greeks has not profited * directly * by the overt borrowing of the previous generation and yet are responsible for the existing debt . 
  this is relevant later in the sketch . 
   if they do n't want eu help they can get it somewhere else , i am not opposed to it . 
  the problem is that the reforms imposed by the troika have not helped greece ** at all ** during the past 5 years . 
  yet the entire political establishment of europe was singing praises for samaras and his government and preaching doom for tsipras before the greek elections . 
  why would that be if the previous greek government was fucking up with the program ? 
  the answer is , the previous government ** was simply doing exactly what the troika told them to do ** and the results ** were totally ineffective ** as well as ** disastrous for the greek society ** . 
   but other nations wo n't help that easily . 
  they will ask for far more . 
  which putin probably did , which is the reason tsipras elected not to accept the loan from russia . 
  i hope you wo n't * hold that against him * ...  and the part about the reparations is stupid and unfunny too . 
  i must say that i could not bring myself to smile during the second part of the sketch , mostly because of the stories in my head of the horror my grandmother went through during the nazi occupation . 
  sorry you did n't find it amusing as well . 
   if it was about justice they would have been this loud years ago . 
  there was not a single greek government from the 1950s till the 1990s that did not ask for reparations . 
  you are either ignorant or a liar . 
   now it 's just polemic politics to threaten us . 
  i can only fault each and every greek government for not persuing this issue legally immediately , like the israelis did , instead of relying to diplomacy . 
  more fools them . 
   and threatening the eu wo n't end well . 
  germany is not the eu . 
  this issue is not greece vs the eu . 
  none of the other eu members did to greece what germany did during ww2 . 
  the italians occupied almost half of greece between 1941 and 1943 and never made ** remotely ** as many war crimes as those done by the nazis . 
   this shit with the reparations or other money they want ends in shit like this [ `` bis in die dritte generation m\u00fcsst ihr fronen '' - `` until the third generation you have to indulge '' ] ( http://imgur.com/jadjqdo ) ( original file in https://www.dhm.de/fileadmin/medien/lemo/images/p74-3797.jpg ) . 
  this is the relevant part i mentioned above , `` they want to get accross the message that the current generation of greeks has not profited * directly * by the overt borrowing of the previous generation and yet are responsible for the existing debt '' . 
  if the greeks of today are responsible for what the greeks of yesterday did then in the same way the germans of today are responsible for what the germans of yesterday did as well . 
  there are a lot of people pretending that ww2 happened a million years ago . 
  i would like to remind them that there are still alive today ** millions ** of men and women who lived through that war as young adults or children . 
  one of which was the gentleman at the end of the sketch , whose entire family was murdered . 
  so have a little respect and be more careful with what you say about matters like that . 
   the right is already rising in germany and it wants to fuck greece . 
  is n't this a threat ? 
  and are n't you one of those who would vote those people ? 
   so steps down from your high horse and acknowledge greece is the main player in this tragedy but also the main antagonist who made the debts in the first place . 
  i know all this will fly over your head but i hope to have helped at least one person who might read what i have written and consider the situation from a neutral perspective . 
  it would be wonderful to have a conversation with a person like that . 
   that last part was * irony * . 
  you may want to look it up ?!, 
  no , it was not [ irony ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irony ) . 
  it was more like if it was raining on your wedding day . 
  but how would * you * know something like that ... 
  all i know is there was ** not a spec of falsehood or even exaggeration ** as regards to the historical facts presented in [ this sketch ] ( https://youtu.be/_qimxvuiczu ) and , not understanding german , i only have a statistical sample of 1 to go with . 
  did you find any specific objections as regards to this particular sketch ? 
   or do you claim that the troika tried to confiscate your chairs ?!, 
  here is a new word for you today : [ metaphor ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metaphor ) and here is an [ analysis of the sketch ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/31rttl/z/cq57r7o ) . 
    is it the fact they use comedy that confuses you ? 
  talk about using stereotypes ...  yes , fuck you too . 
  thank you for letting me know that making any further discussion with you is unnecessary . 
   i can laugh at john olivers jokes . 
  because they are funny , unlike the ones made by die anstalt . 
  well , even if humour is relative , both shows have used extensive research in the two examples i provided above and ** present hard facts ** in a way that might be considered amusing . 
  a bittersweet kernel of knowledge if you will . 
  the form these facts are presented in should in no way detract from the seriousness of the facts themselves . 
   eh , my german is n't that great . 
  whats the general sentiment of this video ? 
  well , it starts off by comically describing the current situation in greece now , by making a metaphor between the greek government and the troika to a greek tavern owner and his creditors/financial advisors . 
  it shows how the advice he has been getting is actually hurting his business and is completely unsustainable , resulting in the owner eventually having to close his tavern completely if positive changes are not made . 
  but when the tavern owner suggests positive changes , the creditors show him the rules that were agreed before he could get any help : `` a ) rules are rules '' `` b ) debts must be paid '' `` c ) no tricks '' in the following segment , the bit describes the damage inflicted to greece by germany during ww2 in human suffering , destroyed infrastructure , and forced loans that resulted in wealth stolen from greece by the nazis . 
  it describes the decades long process of deferring *** most *** of the debt owed to greece by germany ( both ethical and financial ) to a future date and eventually disowing it completely in 1990 by using a legal trick . 
  it speaks about how war crimes that took place in greece were never punished ( and that the greek government was told by west germany to simply pardon the purputrators and be done with it ) and focuses to the case of a village whose entire population was brutally murdered . 
  it shows the picture of a boy whose entire family was killed by the ss and who later tried to claim retributions but was told that what happened to his village was `` normal procedure in the course of war '' by the all the post-war german governments . 
  in the last part of the show , the boy shown in the picture is revealed to be the old man speaking in german ( he learned german because he had to be raised in a swiss orphanage ) . 
  he tells of how german president gauck [ finally offered an apology in 2014 ] ( http://www.bild.de/video/clip/gauck-joachim/gauck-bittet-griechenland-wegen-nazi-verbrechen-um-verzeihung-agvideo-34980858.bild.html ) ( 70 years after the atrocity ) ** but not in his official capacity ** as president , because that would mean admitting to owing a debt that was never paid . 
  the program ends with the hosts asking the old man : `` what should be done now ? '', 
  and he answers : `` a ) rules are rules '' `` b ) debts must be paid '' `` c ) no tricks '' edit : changed simile to metaphor, 
    die anstalt  there you got the problem . 
  how different would you say that die anstalt is from [ last week tonight ] ( https://youtu.be/p8pjd1qea0c ) ? 
  because [ the facts stated in their comedy bit ] ( https://youtu.be/_qimxvuiczu ) are undisputable . 
  is it the fact they use comedy that confuses you ? 
  ^ ( talk ^ ^ about ^ ^ ^ using ^ ^ ^ ^ stereotypes ... ), 
  [ so it only took one week for this video to be forgotten ... ] ( https://youtu.be/_qimxvuiczu ), 
  you dodged the question . 
  i asked you specifically why does the turkish military need hundreds of [ amphibious armoured vehicle-launched bridges ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armoured_vehicle-launched_bridge ) and where exactly is it planning to deploy them ? 
  is it by pure coincidence that the only land border between greece and turkey is defined by the [ evros river ] ( http://www.defencegreece.com/index.php/2012/02/discomfort-in-turkey-for-the-fence-in-evros/ ) ? 
   yeah , you guys are not naive . 
  you guys are delusional . 
  [ so where exactly does the turkish military plan to use this piece of hardware then ? 
  [ educate yourself kardasi .
