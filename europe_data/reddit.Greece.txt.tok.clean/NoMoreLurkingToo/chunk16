   i 'm thankful that i was born somewhere safe , stable , and free . 
  that goes for both being european and being irish . 
  it would be wise to remember that safety , stability and freedom is not only a fuction of place but also a function of time . 
  just imagine being born at the exact same place anywhere between 100 and 800 years ago ... 
  sadly , the european dream we were sold was just another utopia . 
  like the land of the free and the home of the brave respectively is in the us . 
  those with power make promises they know they will not keep in order to remain in control and trick the rest into submission . 
  there is a lot of time wasted ( meaningless tasks done and a lot of \u03bb\u03bf\u03cd\u03c6\u03b1 ) , but it is not a waste of time ( it serves a purpose keeping a standing army in our neighborhood ) . 
  happy 1st of april ;-), 
   nah , they 're usually doing a lot for this kind of stuff . 
  the amphipolis tomb fiasco is a recent example . 
  if you mean that it is not [ the tomb where the body of alexander the great ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kasta_tomb ) is buried , most people never really believed it was . 
  and it still is an important archeological find , just nowhere near as important as knosos . 
  this is just another ( typical ) case of misplaced priorities ... 
  ah , my apologies then !, 
  under that light it seems simply typical greek government do-nothingness ... 
  possibly [ the first city in europe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/knossos ) is [ not included in the list ] ( http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/ ) ?

  it was n't the war itself . 
  it was a planned extermination . 
  we ** have to remember ** this . 
  if history teaches us that we do not learn from history , this is at least one lesson we can not afford to forget . 
  :d that was actually a pretty good simile , a lot of taxation in greece does seem like someone trying to collect property tax for homeownership from turtles ( while all the whales just swim away scot-free ... ), 
  that is sort of like saying that a turtle is a homeowner as well ... 
   [ ... ] with most recent the ex-prime minister samaras on tape ( and another incident of a close colleague of his ) tampering with justice by basically telling them what to do and a refreshing amount of vulgarity and swearing . 
  could you give me a source on that ? 
  it 's the first time i 've heard of this . 
   i do n't know , red and black looks so agressive . 
  [ it was initially a war flag .

  if only everyone in this world always got what they deserved ... 
    not only the americans ...  yes , they fucked up . 
  shame . 
   still - you can talk about it and you can criticise them for it . 
   in russia you do n't talk about such things , or you end up in prison or in grave , if you do . 
  and the man who runs the country soon will be 20 year `` president '' , as well they could stop pretending and call him ~ ~ f\u00fchrer ~ ~ tsar . 
  and in greece people can protest against what they feel is the destruction of their country . 
  for all the good it does them ...

  if we would * be allowed * to choose , i thing [ canningshire ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/george_canning ) would be more apt .

  do you agree ? 
  would ~ ~ it ~ ~ not grexit be a win-win for everyone then ?

   but a grexis is only going to weaken the euro further against the krone .

  300 but seriously , [ this ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089079/ ) is a great movie , starting john malkovich , on greece 's last ( latest ? ), 
  civil war and recent history . 
  definitely worth seeing . 
  edit : [ this ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1334328/ ) is also another great movie on the subject of the civil war , told from the perspective of the other side . 
  but it is in greek and i do n't know if there is a dvd with subtitles . 
  [ best comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/serbia/comments/4clsp5/how_do_you_feel_about_kosovo/d1jbsp6 ) :  very butthurt , that 's how i feel honestly , it 's like your wife running away with some guy who 's uglier than you , has less money and a smaller dick , you wonder if there 's any justice in this world and if god is indeed dead , that 's why i became an atheist . 
  top kek :d, 
  good for you . 
  i understand what you are saying but it would be impracticable to mandate court appearances for each and every traffic ticket ever written . 
  the cost would have to be incorporated into the ticket itself and payed by every offender , even if they do not want to protest the fine because they know that they are guilty . 
  the judicial system has given some authority directly to the police in certain cases . 
  for example , the police can arrest and hold people for 24 hours ( and in some countries even a week ) before bringing them in front of a judge , who can then decide if an even longer period of custody ( before even the trial begins ) is necessary . 
  else we would need thousands of judges , multiple in every police department , just so as to make ( near ) instant decisions in each and every case . 
  such a system would be prohibitively expensive . 
  a last resort for `` instant justice '' would be the judge dread system , but i think most people would n't really like it so much in practice ... 
  you might have a bright future `` in the hellenic '' as well , as a lot of girls from your country already had ;-), 
  odessa or sevastopol , who gives a fuck what the port is called ?
