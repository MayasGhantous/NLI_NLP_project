  seems like you stopped going to school after you ran out of fingers to count the years . 
  and i am trully sorry you seem to have only one arm . 
    realpolitik  [ mmm ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/youre_serious_futurama.gif ) . 
  if you call [ this ] ( http://realrussiatoday.com/2016/03/2v3/zhirinovsky-let-europeans-be-killed-and-die/ ) realpolitik , i have nothing to add alright , i 'll bite . 
  even though i feel i am simply wasting my time here . 
  realpolitik is understanding that the cause in political decisions is based on the interest of the nation making them , and nothing else . 
  not law , not protecting civilians , nothing . 
  russia practices realpolitik . 
  since the times of the soviet union ** and before ** , the russian navy had access to the naval base near ~ ~ odessa ~ ~ sevastopol . 
  the change of government in ukraine threatened to cut them off from its use . 
  why the change of government happened in the first place could very well originate from the us practicing realpolitik in ukraine ( they do n't really give a shit about the people there either you know ) . 
  so the russians manufactured an excuse to invade crimea . 
  having a russian population there ( which incidentally has been there for centuries , unlike latvia ) was only used as a justification . 
  if there was not ** this ** justification , they would have invented another one . 
  the port is too valuable to them , so even open war against nato would not have deterred them . 
  it was a miscalculation from the part of the us to try and burrow so deeply into the russian underbelly . 
  crimea is the new kosovo and east ukraine will be used as a bargaining chip to normalise relations within a couple of years . 
  looks like you ca n't even read the linked wikipedia article ... how many years of school have you had ? 
  is n't 2 comments in the same month too many for this alt account , porosenko-bot ? 
   very valuable opinion . 
  you can make a career on russian tv why ? 
  is it that only place left where people can discuss realpolitik in the open ? 
   sad day for europe was when it gifted czechoslovakia ** to you know who ** , now it looks like it wants to give similar gift to russia . 
  only few european leaders seems to understand level of danger [ godwin 's law ftw ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/godwin%27s_law ), 
   if that worked , crimea annexation would not happen . 
  people tend to believe pleasant lies , populists , especially when truth is broadcasted using shitty equipment or not represented in your list of channels at all . 
  crimea annexation was inevitable from the moment the russian navy had to worry if they could park on ~ ~ odessa ~ ~ sevastopol harbor next year or not . 
  all the rest is bullshit . 
    a policeman can give you a fine for anything they might think you have done , but you can definitely protest the fine in a court of law and have it expunged ( if it is determined that the fine was given without reason ) . 
  you admitting to committing the crime would mean that the protest would not take place but not all people admit to committing a crime , that is why courts exist !, 
   this has gotten me curious : is n't it normally the case that a trial should take place anyway , and the confession of committing the crime be presented there ? 
  if i am the one that has to protest an accusation , am i not being assumed guilty , until proved that my protest is right ? 
  the reason why 99 % of tickets ( given in europe ) are not protested is because the people getting the ticket ** know that they are guilty ** and ** know that the prosecution ** ** can ** ( probably ) ** provide evidence to the court ** that would eventually ** prove that they are guilty ** . 
  when you go to court , you have to pay for a lawyer and if you are found guilty you also have to pay for court expenses so ** why would anyone ** who knows that they are guilty try to do that ? 
  they would end up paying multiple times more money than if they had just paid the ticket . 
  and the reason why police does n't write false tickets is also the existence of this system . 
  because if 10 innocent people protest their tickets in court , that they could have gotten from the same policeman , that policeman would get fired ( since the tickets would be annulled and the state would have to pay for the court expenses , and even maybe for the lawyers of the innocent people ) . 
   there is a difference between policeman killing a criminal and criminal killing a policeman . 
  there is ** no ** difference , if the life of the policeman is ** in no immediate ** danger . 
  the police are not the avengers , there is a legal procedure for those who break the law . 
  and the legal procedure was not followed in this case , which is a sad day for europe . 
   [ ... ] it 's very likely the eu would side with latvia on this one as it is in eu 's best interest to defend it 's member state . 
  i am aware of the concept of realpolitik but it 's application on court decisions is something nobody should want . 
  a court should always decide on a case regardless of who is the defendant , it is a slippery slope to allow politics to influence the result of court decisions ... 
   following your logic , islamic state propaganda should be allowed too . 
    you act like there are no other media outlets in europe !, 
  who is forcing europeans to listen to isis propaganda , have n't you heard of the remote control ? 
  you press a button and the channel changes !, 
  remarkable !, 
   ftfy . 
  so for you putin = isis correct ? 
   there is a thing you do n't have , called ethnic russians who were sent here in soviet times . 
  what percent are they of your population ? 
  what would * you * prefer * they * listen to ? 
   maybe they referenced the wrong regulation as a few people , including you , pointed out inconsistencies . 
  it does seem wrong ; hence , i abstained from making any conclusions . 
   most likely the decision will resort to article 4.2 of the treaty of the european union which to an extent permits such actions . 
  article 4.2 of the treaty ** on ** the european union : `` the union shall respect the equality of member states before the treaties as well as their national identities , inherent in their fundamental structures , political and constitutional , inclusive of regional and local self-government . 
  it shall respect their essential state functions , including ensuring the territorial integrity of the state , maintaining law and order and safeguarding national security . 
  in particular , national security remains the sole responsibility of each member state . '', 
  so if sputnik sues latvia in the ecj , then latvia should have to defend their case by saying it was a matter of national security ? 
  tall order , would like to see how that would turn out ... 
    imo  why he did n't sue is how own business . 
  if someone says something bad about you and you do n't protest , you implicitly approve of what was said . 
  so if this politician does n't sue that channel it can only mean he agrees with what they said . 
  or that he is scared , in which case he should change his career altogether . 
   if you ca n't counter putin 's propaganda , what else is left to stop russian lies ? 
  you act like there are no other media outlets in europe !, 
  who is forcing europeans to listen to putin 's propaganda , have n't you heard of the remote control ? 
  you press a button and the channel changes !, 
  remarkable !, 
   the politician is in the opposition , in a pro-russian party , it 's not in his interests to sue for anything , imo , since it would paint russian media in a bad light . 
  then the example you gave above is immaterial . 
  do you have something more concrete ? 
   [ ... ] also , it 's more likely connected to the regulation 2016/353 of the eu * concerning restrictive measures in respect of actions undermining or threatening the territorial integrity , sovereignty and independence of ukraine * . 
   http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=uriserv:oj.c_.2016.097.01.0015.01.eng&amp;toc=oj:c:2016:097:toc  [ ... ]  edit : added an eu regulation backing the decision . 
  regulation 2016/353 makes ** no mention ** of shutting down ** any ** websites whose content we do n't like and makes ** no mention ** of sputnik in particular . 
  this regulation merely restricts some ** economic ** relations between the eu member states ( together with switzerland ) against russia and a few individual persons in crimea or russia . 
  using this regulation to try and justify the ** illegal ** action taken by the latvian government is similar to blaming encryption for the terrorist strikes in paris and brussels . 
   apples and oranges . 
   russia blocks access to websites this on a routine basis . 
  any small town court has the power to block the certain website for all russia . 
  so you think we should act more like russia does ? 
  why not take them to court for slander then ? 
  the way this case is presented here , they would be up for a fine of tens of thousands of euros , if not hundreds of thousands . 
  not to mention the court forcing them to transmit through their own channel an apology for lying and an explanation of the true course of events . 
  that might have been sufficient to close the channel altogether ** without braking the law ** . 
   this just sounds silly , nowhere in my life after breaking the law have i had a situation where i ** had ** to go to court before i was found guilty . 
  what ? 
  do you even understand how the law works ? 
  only a ** judge ** can ** find you guilty ** of anything . 
  a policeman can give you a fine for anything they might think you have done , but you can ** definitely ** protest the fine in a court of law and have it expunged ( if it is determined that the fine was given without reason ) . 
  you admitting to committing the crime would mean that the protest would not take place but not all people admit to committing a crime , that is why courts exist !, 
  and at any rate , the government in any democratic nation is part of the ** legislative branch ** and ** executive branch ** and ** most definitely not the judicial branch ** ; so issuing an executive order to fine or impose closure on a business of any kind ** without authorization from the judicial branch ** is a definite breach of their role in government . 
   i pissed on the mayoral building in riga , police apprehended me and wrote me an administrative fine . 
  i was guilty without a court saying it as such . 
  the police could very easily apprehend you when simply walking down the street and give you a ticket for speeding , does n't mean you are automatically guilty . 
  what the hell are you even talking about ? 
  by paying the ticket you automatically admit guilt and avoid court expenses of a trial that would be destined to ** actually find you guilty if you know the prosecution can present sufficient evidence against you ** . 
  if proof does not exist ( determined by the court ) ** you are found not guilty ** .
