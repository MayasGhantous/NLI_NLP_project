   if you saw someone gunning down innocent people in a crowded area ( e.g.

  can you provide a link to a credible source for this ? 
  i know very well the syriza policies on the matter but , to my recollection , there has never been an explicit announcement on the matter . 
  [ unlike this for instance ... ] ( http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-germany-migrant-help-20150907-story.html ) edit : further , [ according to the unhcr ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/56d58c146.html ) , '' ... data as of this morning ( 2016-03-01 ) shows that 131,724 people made the journey during january and february ( 122,637 of these landing in greece ) . 
  this is approaching the total for the first half of 2015 ( 147,209 ) ... '' so we can clearly see ** when ** the flow surged . 
   erdogan was there the last year , and the year before the last year . 
   syrian civil war is there since 2011 . 
  and the refugee/migrant flow from turkey to greece has been there since the fall of the soviet union . 
  it was just smaller because there was n't a failed state so close to turkey before . 
  the refugees from syria have been accumulating in turkey for the last 4 years with little hope of going back to their country ( that is now a heap of rubble ) . 
   the only thing that changed in 2015 is the government in greece . 
  their choice was to stay in tents in turkey for the next decade or cross to europe , since very little was done to help them there . 
  how long can people live like that ? 
   and in 2015 the refugees flow in greece increased 20 times . 
  the people simply got sick of being stacked on top of eachother and left to find a better place . 
   syriza is the only one to blame for the refugee crisis , since they openly declared that `` anyone who wants to pass through greece to go to europe should be able to do so '' . 
  so first they called the refugees to come , then they say `` but they are coming , what can we do '' ... 
  i really doubt the refugees have ever even heard of syriza . 
  i bet they 've heard of merkel though ... 
   turkey has 3 million of them in their lands ( officially , probably the real numbers are much higher ) . 
  good luck controlling all of them . 
  even germany lost track of 100.000 of them and have no idea where they are . 
  fucking germany the richest country of europe cant control all of them but people expect turkey to perfect control of situation ? 
  how many of the people in turkey , of those who facilitate the sea crossing to the greek islands , have been prosecuted ? 
  or at least arrested ? 
  where do they obtain the ** thousands ** of rubber boats they use to cram the refugees/migrants that attempt to cross ? 
  how many turkish border guards/police have been deployed to the beaches right across from greek islands to attempt stopping those trying to cross ? 
  i am not saying that turkey has not spent large sums of money to help the refugees survive , it clearly has . 
  and turkey should be supported economically even more to continue to do so . 
  but the turkish government is clearly using those people as diplomatic ammunition by not even attempting to stop the flow into greece . 
   anti turkish circlejerk is really strong these days .
