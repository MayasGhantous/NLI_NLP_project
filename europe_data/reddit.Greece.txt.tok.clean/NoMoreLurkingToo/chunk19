  there is a circlejerk in reddit on every major issue . 
  reddit takes a subject to the extreme . 
  but that is not to say there is n't some underlying issue ( s ) that needs to be resolved . 
   and germany only paid 3 billion euro . 
  the cost of refrugees to turkey is much much higher than that number . 
  turkey is clearly struggling on this matter and noone really cares other than germany . 
  an estimate i have heard is $ 7b until the end of 2015 and that is a lot of money . 
  surely turkey must be assisted by the eu and the international community . 
  but at the same time i would also like to know how much was spent by turkey trying to destabilize syria to serve its own geopolitical agenda . 
  it is not as if turkey is a complete bystander regarding the syrian war . 
   look how much greece suffering from this and how much eu is helping them on this matter ... any assistance given to greece in the matter of the refugees is too little and came too late . 
  and the potential closing off of shenghen borders to greece does n't seem particularly helpful either . 
   europe should not have to accept millions of refugees/illegal immigrants ** because greece is unable/unwilling to cooperate with turkey for controlling their joint border ** . 
  full of shit right there . 
  turkey lets the refugees walk the ** entire length ** of their country unhindered , board boats ** every day from the same beaches ** to cross the aegean , and refuses to accept back to their shores ** the same people who illegally left from there ** ; and it still somehow is the fault of greece for `` not cooperating '' with turkey . 
  gtfo . 
    there 's no sense of urgency in dealing with this crisis  well , there is . 
  if nothing is done soon , tourism this year will be in a very bad state which will bring down the economy even more . 
   not really . 
  there are not 225,000 crimeans missing due to ukrainian political actions . 
  are we still speaking in comparison to kosovo ? 
  are you talking about things that happened during soviet times ? 
  if you are comparing with kosovo , where does the number 225,000 come from ? 
  the [ highest number possible ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kosovo_war#casualties ) for casualties in kosovo between 1995 and 2000 is 12,000 including serbians and roma killed by [ kla . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kosovo_liberation_army#massacres )  there was no attempted genocide by ukraine and there certainly was no ethnic cleansing in crimea . 
  if you can show me evidence contrary to what i said i 'd be happy to indulge . 
  after yanukovych was toppled , the people of crimea could have felt they were no longer represented in the government of their country . 
  a population , that is concerned in one area which they have historically populated for generations , may then decide to govern themselves . 
  in the same way it happened in kosovo . 
  whether the people of crimea , in the same way the people of kosovo , have ** the right ** to do that is another matter . 
  but it is the same case for both regions . 
  ethnic cleansing by whatever means is abhorrent anywhere it occurs , including the northern part of kosovo in the present day . 
   well kosovo was a province of serbia and croatia and bosnia were provinces of yugolsvia i do n't think kosovo had the legal right to even split `` the [ icj ] ( http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/141/15988.pdf ) concluded unanimously in 2010 that kosovo 's declaration of independence of 17 february 2008 did not violate general international law . '', 
  my opinion on the matter may differ but nobody asked me , or you . 
   so i do n't even know why are we having this conversation . 
  might is right and that 's it . 
  i 'm actually fine with that . 
  what pisses me off is being forced into doublethink by either side . 
    what is xcom 2 and how does it affect your life ? 
   a video game and it affects my life very badly . 
  hope you overcome your addiction !, 
  being a bit older , the last game that had me hooked was starcraft . 
  the first one ... 
   but kosovo did n't want independance . 
  kosovo albanians wanted it . 
  to be honest , 70 % of people living in kosovo are indeed albanians , 90 % if the northern part of kosovo is to be excluded . 
  and i suspect that was the reason why a referendum was not called in the first place ...  so your solution is to give every minority in every country a right to make a country if it holds a referendum only in part of a country inhabited with that particular minority and without consent of whole country and central government ? 
  it is not ** my ** solution , i am simply pointing out that if something like that would be acceptable in the case of kosovo , then it should be equally acceptable in the case of crimea . 
   so 100 000 serbs want to declare independance in the middle of austria . 
  sure , just hold a referndum where only serbs in austria can vote . 
  this is the exact reason why people have to decide whether if both the cases of kosovo and crimea are ** equally ** acceptable or not . 
  if they are both acceptable then your example is also valid . 
  if they are both unacceptable then your example is also invalid . 
   are you from parallel reality ? 
  how are things there ? 
  is xcom 2 less buggy there ? 
  what is xcom 2 and how does it affect your life ? 
  a referendum in kosovo in 1991 , as well as in every other region of yugoslavia , would have been the best solution . 
  but each side made their own kind of referenda , that the other side did not accept , and what followed was horror for the entire country . 
   i dnno who taught you history but referrendums about yugoslavia were held in major provinces   it could be argued that kosovo should have been allowed to do a similar referendum ** immediately after yugoslavia was dissolved ** as well . 
  the results would have been very similar . 
  there was no referendum in kosovo in 1991 or after . 
  what was the reason for this ? 
    in fact , if regional referanda were held ** in every major city ** within yugoslavia ( of whether the people wanted to remain in the union or not ) , ** and the results accepted by everyone ** , the war could have been avoided . 
  the referanda were ** not ** accepted from the other respected sides ; and were not implemented in every region of former yugoslavia . 
  well , i stand corrected !, 
  there should have been a referendum and the areas that wanted to form an independent state should then have been treated in the same manner as crimea . 
  it could be argued that kosovo should have been allowed to do a similar referendum immediately after yugoslavia was dissolved as well . 
  the results would have been very similar . 
  in fact , if regional referanda were held in every major city within yugoslavia ( of whether the people wanted to remain in the union or not ) , and the results accepted by everyone , the war could have been avoided . 
  ~ ~ there was a referendum ~ ~ there was a declaration of independence in kosovo and there was a referendum in crimea . 
  either both are legitimate or neither is . 
  could i get a source for that in english please ? 
  kosovo has as much a right to leave serbia as crimea has a right to leave ukraine . 
  edit : phrased differently : kosovo did not have the right to leave serbia and neither did crimea have the right to leave ukraine . 
  in order for one to be true ( or false ) , the other must equally be true ( or false ) . 
  the differences between these two regions are minimal as regards to their history during the last 30 years . 
  the diagram represents the flawed data it was based upon . 
  it is not the fault of the person who made the diagram ( although s/he could have done a bit more independent research ) but of those who compiled the information erroneously . 
  greek * lexical * distance lol, 
   from the same article :  a detailed report seen by germany 's bild newspaper listed a total of 1,688 sex crimes committed by ** asylum seekers ** , refugees ** and illegal immigrants ** in 2015 -- 3.6 per cent of the nationwide total of almost 47,000 . 
   of those , 458 were rapes or sexual assaults . 
  * ** refugees ** make up roughly 2 per cent of germany 's population , the the local reported , meaning the rate of sexual offences is disproportionately high . 
  * question no1 : are n't part of the asylum seekers making a false claim to asylum , coming from countries that are not at war or from governments that are not persecuting them ? 
  should n't they then be differentiated somehow ? 
  and different statistics be made depending on each specific group ? 
  question no2 : what are the statistics specifically to genuine refugees ( those who have obtained asylum status ) ? 
  question no3 : why are illegal immigrants ( those who were already determined to not qualify for asylum ) allowed to remain in europe ? 
  why is there no paneuropean policy in place to deport these people directly to their countries of origin ? 
  who is really to blame for the crimes committed by these people ? 
  question no4 : how was the designation `` refugees '' used in the last paragraph ? 
  is 2 % of the population only refugees or all the categories above together ? 
  stay safe man . 
  and i hope you are using a proxy ... 
  they would actually look best on what remains of the berlin wall . 
  not all of them . 
  many thousands have even got bulgarian passports as well ( in secret of course ) ... 
  yes , but most were rescued . 
  those of them that could n't swim though ... 
  not sure if that many but surely over 2.000 already .
