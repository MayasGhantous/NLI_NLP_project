   greek redditors , what kind of paper is protothema , is it comparable to bild ? 
  pretty much i would guess . 
  how often does bild have an article on [ penis sizes ] ( http://en.protothema.gr/sizeper-country-around-the-globe-map/ ) ? 
  or [ on a new underwear photo shoot ] ( http://www.protothema.gr/life-style/fashion/article/492128/natalia-vodianova-pozarei-mono-me-ta-esorouha-tis/ ) ? 
  or [ tries to sell you books and give you coupons ] ( http://www.protothema.gr/greece/article/493220/mi-hasete-to-thema-me-4-monadikes-prosfores/ ) ? 
  do n't feed that troll man . 
  take a look at his post history .

  what 's with the sudden empathy towards greek people vile frog ? 
  there are 85 billion reasons * this deal is better than the one before . 
  * edit : terms and conditions may apply ... 
   only reason why they want to end open borders is that other nations greece , spain and italy etc. 
  cant handle their own border good enough so there will be illegals who can get to other eu nations easily [ i guess you would throw these people back to the sea huh ?

  yeah , if you want a debate in greek , head to / r/greece, 
   actually , the deal syriza ended up with is much tougher on greece than what was on the table before the referendum a few weeks ago , not to mention back in february . 
   but hey , they got to play politics with the big boys for a few months . 
  if it makes you feel better * to believe * that greece got a worse deal than it would have 2 weeks ago , i am happy for you . 
  edit : clarification, 
  `` nuclear power plants are safe '' `` this was an isolated incident '' `` nuclear power is * green * '' `` i feel safe living near a nuclear power plant , i just * choose * not to '' shut them all down . 
  go solar/wind/wave / biofuel . 
  think of tomorrow . 
  is it safe to assume that you have moved further to the left ? 
  edit : no accusation or anything , just curiosity . 
    this means that greece will never be able to repay its debt . 
   but is n't that going to be the case either way ? 
  forget the debt . 
  you need an economy first . 
  debt payment can only come later . 
  not having an agreement on repaying national debt leads to having the same problems argentina is currently experiencing ... 
  i am not a suriza supporter but i support the current greek government in their effort to stir the greek economy in a different direction . 
  the main problem with greece existing the eurozone is that the euro would gain against other currencies substantially ( except in case of future speculation for itexit or spexit ) but our debt is now in euros under english law . 
  this means that greece will never be able to repay its debt . 
  and that would mean being blocked from the global banking system , which would severely hinder transnational economic transactions . 
  it will be tough , but preferable to subjugation in any case . 
  wow . 
  whoever came up with `` those who forget history are bound to repeat it '' was n't kidding ... 
  oh , this a good question :-) maybe we should get out while we still can !, 
  [ you could have been a bit more accommodating and explained why ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3d1wri/sch\u00e4uble_on_the_board_of_the_development_bank/ct113pu ), 
   we 're hearing a lot about how greece has lost the trust and credibility . 
  i think rather that germany has lost these now , especially with the two proposals from yesterday . 
   we have found out that both sides are ` kids ' , with no real direction or vision for the future . 
   this crisis has firmly made me into an opponent for the euro in bulgaria . 
  we suck at our own governance and fiscal policy , but at least i can attempt to vote out anyone here i do n't like . 
  i ca n't touch sch\u00e4uble , and relying on a foreign electorate to help me out is not a position i want to be in . 
  i must agree with everything you said . 
   in recent history that is like saying `` who is the tallest kid in the classroom '' , in a school with 1000 students . 
  i 'd like to know who is the tallest kid in the entire school instead ... 
  what would happen if all * other * countries re-adopted their own national currencies * except for * greece ? 
  think outside of the box for a moment . 
  greece is trapped in debt in euros ( a currently very hard currency ) that she can not repay . 
  the other ez members also have a lot of debt in euros . 
  if all other countries would re-adopt their national currencies at the same time , the value of the euro would plummet and the debt would shrink as a proportion of gdp for every country with the new currency . 
  then greece could file bankruptcy and start paying her debts with massively inflated euros . 
  win-win for the whole of europe :-) p.s. 
  this is simply a humorous suggestion and should not be taken seriously by anyone ... 
  alright , i just tried to lighten the mood with a joke :-), 
  for the sake of the future of the eu , let us truly hope so . 
  edit after 24 hours : well , looks like it was true all along . 
  tomorrow begins a new era for europe , and it does n't look bright . 
   sch\u00e4ubles idea  legaly questionable inconceivable !, 
   the right sector released a note where they 're calling for support from the ukrainian people and asks the ukrainian army not to attack them , if they will be given that order . 
  ah , paramilitaries doing their thing then !, 
  carry on !, 
  if there is going to be a grexit , there are not going to be any terms . 
  they will cut off everything and we will have to fend for ourselves . 
  he could have done what t did . 
  or he could have been smarter even and announce his intention for a referendum at the end of the negotiations once he had started negotiating . 
  either way , he took away power from the greek government ( power given to them by the greek people ) and gave it to extranational institutions . 
  no prime minister should have that right . 
  you are right , papandreou should not have let himself be blackmailed into not doing what was best for his country ( assuming he honestly wanted to make a referendum ) . 
  he should have done the right thing and put the question to the people of greece . 
  but he did not . 
  he failed his country . 
  no no no , do n't be absurd . 
  they can sue you in international courts if you do n't give compensation . 
  but nothing stops you devaluing your currency 10 times * after * you have given * compensation * ... 
  if the european politicians had let greece have a referendum in 2010 , none of this would have happened . 
  the european taxpayers would not have been cheated out of their money ** on the insistence of their own politicians ** and no `` help '' need have been extended to greece at all . 
  bankruptcy and drachma then would have lead to 5 tough years and a healthy economy today . 
  if there is one thing i credit papandreou of doing right , is that he mentioned a referendum in 2010 . 
  had he gone through with it , we would not have been in this situation now . 
   tsipras would rather sit in shit than work a shovel . 
  how about * you * work some shit with a shovel instead of typing sly remarks ? 
  got us here so far !, 
  oh i really hope so . 
  and any compensations payed in drachma !, 
  well , greek people do not often plan for the future but we are at least adept to responding as situations unfold . 
  creative chaos if you will :-), 
  well , i do think alex is smart but is he really * that * s ** m ** art ? 
   free movement of greek citizens in other eu countries . 
  yes . 
  they will need to apply for a visa . 
  tough . 
   common market and tax on imports/exports . 
  european products would become more expensive . 
  greece would have to import from somewhere else .
