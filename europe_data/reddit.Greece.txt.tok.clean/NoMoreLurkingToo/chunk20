  since the fall of the soviet union though , yeah , probably close to 10.000 have drowned trying to cross ... 
  i wonder how many people have drowned in the aegean since the war in syria started . 
  why have a bulgarian flair then ? 
  but no matter , the baltic sea is just as good as the black sea i suppose ... 
  still hurts you can only swim in the black sea without a passport huh ? 
  there is definitely a filter for reuters articles about people drowning in the aegean though ... 
  less than 30.000 troops total ( which each country has to pay for themselves ) and most of which are not even on stand-by 95 % of the time . 
  and have never been deployed anywhere . 
  a fine euro army indeed ... 
   but ** seriously ** , at some point you have to start making tough decisions . 
  when 10 mil people have transited , ** maybe firing at the boats will not be such a bad option anymore ** . 
  ** seriously ??? 
  ** #seriously ??? 
   maybe eu and un will cry but who cares about them anymore , they have made themselves irrelevant . 
  in the end , ** a state that is n't able to protect it 's borders is a failed state that will stop existing after some time passes ** . 
  currently the elephant in the room is the refugee convention and ultra liberal interpretation of it with the eu asylum directive ( thanks eu !!!! ), 
  not shooting unarmed refugees is basic humanity , of which you apparently know nothing about . 
  go now to a `` patrol '' with your neo-nazi `` odinin kamut '' . 
   i guess the eu could put its army what army ? 
   or whatever more like `` nothing whatsoever ''  to guard the northern borders of greece no eu ( schengen * ) country shares a land border with greece , you desperately need to read a map  but this seems like a thing only your enemy would do . 
  friendliness is lacking throughout the e `` u '' ... 
   lol - / u/swejeht i invite you to re-examine your life . 
  that was a v reference in case someone missed it . 
  just , `` hauska '' se on . 
  it has been happening daily for the last 30 years , the only part missing being actually pressing the `` fire '' button ( in most cases , there have been downed aircraft due to `` reasons '' over the years ) . 
  you must have mental issues to draw such a conclusion from what i have written . 
  work on that with a doctor . 
  obviously you are trolling and obviously i am wasting my time with you . 
  i hope you have got your enjoyment of the day and moved on to annoy other people with your nonsense . 
  have fun !, 
  ah , so if i say that what you say is stupid then it does n't mean that you are stupid to say it then right ? 
  fine . 
  what * you * say is stupid . 
   yes the german people are to blame for not fighting nazism in numbers just like syrians are to blame for their current situation so it is the german jews ' fault that ww2 started in the first place ? 
  gee , i never thought of it * that * way ... you * must * be right !, 
  well , there you go . 
  if there is one lesson we have learned from history , it is that we do n't learn from history . 
  people calling other people stupid for making valid questions and using weak arguments to hide their doublespeak are the real geniuses of / r/europe these days . 
  another nation attacked them . 
  but what of the german victims of nazi brutality ? 
  those that were not fortunate enough to flee were butchered . 
   many people believe that you should help any human in need if you are able , regardless of wether or not you were the one who caused their misfortune . 
  i think there was actually this guy who once said `` love your neighbor '' ... 
  i guess he must have meant only the guy who lives next door ... 
  suddenly no environmental concerns anymore ? 
  * this * pipeline is in the interests of bulgaria when the south stream was not ? 
  no , those are death camps . 
  i do n't expect them to be implemented until the 2017 memorandum . 
  `` hotspots '' ... let 's call them what they are : concentration camps .

   judging from your other replies , you are extremely biased and there is no use telling things to you , but ** let me correct your mistake ** for other readers . 
  it is completely the opposite . 
  currently the airspace in the aegean is international airspace beyond 6 miles , ** [ as the international community recognizes it ] ( https://books.google.com/books?id=wviyaqaaqbaj&amp;pg=pa347&amp;dq=greece+claims+a+10-mile+airspace+around+the+aegean+islands.&amp;hl=tr&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewirt5d5v63jahuk7sykhyb4csiq6aeihdaa#v=onepage&amp;q=greece%20claims%20a%2010-mile%20airspace%20around%20the%20aegean%20islands.&amp;f=false ) ** . 
  greece further claims another 4 miles , and harasses and locks on turkish airplanes flying over that area . 
  the vast majority of turkey 's supposed violations are actually turkish airplanes flying ** on what most countries ** recognize as international airspace , and most of the actual violations by turkey happen as they are trying to get out of locks by greek airplanes . 
  you are trying to mislead by saying that most countries recognize a 6 mile limit . 
  most countries recognize the [ territorial waters ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/territorial_waters ) to be at 12 miles from the shore , and the airspace above it to belong as well . 
  this is based on the [ law of the sea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_convention_on_the_law_of_the_sea#parties ) treaty that turkey has conspicuously not ratified . 
   turkey , however , does n't claim any airspace beyond 6 miles over the aegean , so ** it does n't harass greek planes ** flying in the international airspace . 
  most airspace violations done by greece are completely intentional , they are done just to annoy turkey , as a retaliation for turkey 's supposed airspace violations , which are not violations according to the international community . 
  turkish airforce fighter aircraft routinely fly above greek islands ** even before greek fighters have the chance to intercept them ** since most are based on the mainland and have to fly over the entire aegean before they can reach the area . 
  we are not talking about `` supposed '' violations but about blatant harassment . 
  and it is [ not only the greeks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frontex#turkish_airspace_violations ) being harassed either . 
   if greece stops claiming further airspace , there wo n't be any turkish violations by definition . 
  the airspace of 10 miles was [ recognised by turkey itself since before even 1948 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aegean_dispute#national_airspace ) and is recognised still by all other neighboring countries . 
  please educate yourself . 
   what they do n't deserve : a-crisis-free-pass privilige so you feel that many of the pensioners who get under 400 euros a month already are privileged ? 
   sorry to intervene ( i know what a dogfight is ) but i was compelled to say a few things . 
  maybe the other commentator is a bit young to remember or disinterested in the subject , but especially since i grew up in \u0130zmir as a kid i distinctly remember the turko-greek dogfights over on the aegean sea that happened during the 90s ... 
  yet , reading this comment chain i suddenly realized that especially after the second half of the 2000s the sentiment with regards to greece drastically changed in turkey , we no longer see * you * as the enemy for the most and it is quite true that these incidents are largely represented in turkish media as friendly frictions , to the point no one actually cares whether the greeks invade our airspace anymore except maybe the military and the ultra-nationalist idiots ... 
  i can not fathom how anyone in turkey could ever view greece as a military threat ( in the form of an invader ) in today 's world ... 
  the events of izmir and asia minor are almost 100 years old and the world is very different now than it was at the time of the collapse of the ottoman empire . 
   yet you sound as if this is not the case for the greeks , which , if true , might come as a surprise to many of us . 
  people who live in greek islands near turkey see these dogfights very often over their heads . 
  it does not give them a sense of security . 
  imagine your neighbor , almost every day , putting a chair in front of your front door and sitting there having a cigarette ... 
  uninvited ... how would you feel about it after the first 30 years he would do that ? 
   my two cents , and have a nice day from a fellow turk on the other side of the aegean a good day to you as well my friend , i hope we find a way to live in peace without the fear of war over our heads . 
   like i said , i do n't know who is right but i do n't see any reason to have things like this . 
  we should end this `` cold conflict '' . 
  the fairest thing would be for both countries to accept arbitration based on international law . 
  but that would almost certainly mean a big expansion of territorial waters and airspace for greece and a minimal expansion for turkey , leaving almost no international waters left in the aegean . 
  so i am not sure if a fair solution is preferred by some over the current status quo . 
  including this `` cold conflict '' . 
   about us moral , nobody cares about morals in international relations sadly . 
  ~ ~ real politique ( i thought it was french but it is actually german ) ~ ~ realpolitik is a thing , yes , but it really bothers me when `` moral stands '' are taken by obvious hypocrites . 
  especially the americans have a habit of constantly saying one thing and doing the exact opposite . 
  pisses me off to no end . 
  just say what you mean !, 
  turkish fighter jets fly over ** greek houses ** on a weekly basis . 
  this is not only about a demarcation dispute for airspace . 
  turkey actively questions greek sovereignty over our own islands . 
  and besides , whether the turkish like it or not , greece is well within our legal rights to not only claim 10 miles but the full 12 miles of both sea and airspace around our soil . 
  turkish bullying by threatening with a casus beli is not how a nato country is supposed to treat another nato country . 
  and the americans should have been ashamed to have let this stand for so many years , if they had a moral compass . 
   let 's say that 's true , why would greek jets lock on turkish jets ? 
  what 's the point ? 
  i see . 
  sorry to have previously implied you knew what was going on and merely pretended ignorance . 
  there are many trolls in the internet .
