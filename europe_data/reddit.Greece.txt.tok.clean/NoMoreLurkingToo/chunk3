  thank god we still own our harbours :-d  agriculture subsidies and structural funds . 
  agricultural subsidies are frozen and have actually led to decrease of agricultural production . 
  good riddance . 
  edit : structural funds are inaccessible because greek governments for the past 6 years were not allowed to budget them in . 
  so might as well be non-existant  if one day eu wants to play dirty , there is enough of it . 
  eu is playing dirty already . 
  bring it . 
  greece could unilaterally declare that all schengen passports do not require visa when entering greece . 
  so the only negative effect would be to greek tourists going abroad ( hahahahaha ) ... 
  if they were smart , they should have started printing from last monday morning already ... 
  in this moment , with ecb funding stopped , not much is left that can be used to threaten greece anyway ... 
   grexit is the best option ~ ~ for ~ ~ now . 
  ~ ~ tsipras ~ ~ no politicians can be trusted and they wo n't resign . 
  ftfy, 
  well , * someone * will have an island ... 
  if tsipras ever wanted greece out of the ez , now is the time . 
  germany and france [ hold 46 % ] ( http://samcheekong.blogspot.fi/2012/06/are-financial-markets-in-calm-before.html ) of the economic power of the ez . 
  at the same time , [ they believe that 40 % ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/countries-other-than-france-and-germany-could-be-asked-to-take-more-asylumn-seekers-by-the-eu-10289814.html ) of the ** asylum seekers ** is too much of a burden on * their * economies ... not to mention all those thousands who fail to be recognised as asylum seekers and are left * in limbo * in [ the first eu country they enter .

  i wish we could feed all the hungry people that come to our shores . 
  but we ca n't . 
  i wish we would get adequate help to do so . 
  but we do n't . 
  nobody it touching this subject , even with a 7m pole ... 
  [ repost ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3caj2r?sort=top ), 
  quite a few , if you consider those are * the only ones left * of tsipras ... 
  nevertheless , at this stage ( if the final deal includes some debt restructuring ) , the only ones * left * opposing a deal would be the extreme left and the extreme right , no more than 15 % -20 % of the population . 
  and a lot of those , simply because they just want everything to end , in any way possible . 
  really ??!!!, 
  let the hate flow through you ... 
    if a bank approves loans that it can not collect , there is something wrong with the bank , not the borrower . 
   that 's a silly thing to say , particularly in light of greece 's situation . 
  we are talking here about a country that lied plenty over the years . 
  for a private entity it 's basically impossible to do due diligence in respect of a country , you need to ultimately rely on whatever it is they say their finances are . 
  it is the one who lends with interest also the one who should take the risk that the investment might fail . 
  ever since the time of king solomon . 
  if a default would have happened in 2010 , the ones to take most of the losses would have been speculative lenders . 
  legitimate lenders would also have taken a blow but no more than they did on the 2012 haircut . 
  the real victims were the taxpayers of europe that were sold out by their governments : `` even angela merkel , the german chancellor , reportedly acknowledged several years ago that greece 's debt burden was overwhelming . 
  on wednesday , wikileaks released notes written by the u.s. national security agency on a 2011 conversation between merkel and a personal assistant , which was recorded by the n.s.a. '', 
  [ source ] ( http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/greeces-debt-burden-the-truth-finally-emerges ), 
  exactly . 
  the whole mess of the greek default of 2010 would have been finished by now , i bet humanitarian aid would have also not been needed any more as well ( instead of \\* talking about the need to start it * now * ) and the greek economy would be recovering with its inflationary drachma . 
  it was a joke ** ;-) **, 
  very sad . 
  and extremely disappointing . 
  the armenian genocide is not recognised ** neither ** by the us federal government ** nor ** by the un security council . 
  it has been 100 years already . 
  enough is enough . 
  the armenian genocide should be recognized ** now ** . 
  you are delusional . 
  these matters have been discussed extensively and if you are really interested to find out more about them , i suggest you start by reading my comment history for the past 6 months . 
  i will not repeat all my discussions for your sole benefit . 
  [ enjoy ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2015/jul/10/greek-debt-crisis-whats-in-the-proposals-from-athens ), 
  from which bank ? 
  but tsipras is of course an exception . 
  so you ** do ** admit that the `` greek '' bailouts were actually bank bailouts ? 
  glad to hear it !, 
   sold by whom ? 
  yes , i thought i was quite clear . 
  why the need to reiterate ? 
   oh , and i was under the impression the austerity measures proposed were unacceptable because it was the poor greeks that were the worst hit rather than the richer ones . 
  the newer measures * do * offer more protection to the poorest , you clearly have not read them . 
  `` austerity '' is not synonymous with `` screw the poor '' , it means spending less and taxing more . 
  and a lot of the weight has indeed been shifted to the richer greeks with the latest proposal . 
  even this is going to damage the economy because ** all extreme austerity is bad for the economy ** but hopefully will affect the poor less . 
   if that was the plan all along why was n't this stated in the referendum ? 
  the honest option would have been for the greeks to have the option to choose austerity coupled with debt relief . 
  honest to whom ? 
  i judge it sufficiently honest to the greek people and it is them the greek government is serving . 
  probably . 
  but it would be proper to do . 
  and if it was done already in 2010 , the taxpayers of european nations would not have had to be forced by their governments to pay for the losses of the banks belonging to the buddies of the eu politicians . 
   i do n't think so . 
  debt restructuring or not , syriza was against austerity measures . 
  the question on the referendum was `` should we accept the deal offered to us ( that did not include debt restructuring ) , yes or no '' . 
  i do n't dispute the fact that the ` no ' vote was sold to people as `` no to austerity '' but * technically * the referendum had nothing to do with austerity * in and of itself * . 
  and t & v have always said that debt restructure was always their primary goal . 
  so if they achieve that , even with the latest measures proposed by the greek government , and also stay in the eurozone , more than 80 % of the greek people will be satisfied . 
  which is what democracy is in the bottom line . 
  nah , they are all just hungry . 
  i guess in 48 hours , either i will owe you an apology ( in case of austerity without debt restructure ) or you will owe me an apology for calling tsipras a traitor . 
  i guess we will see tomorrow . 
  it is the responsibility of the governments of europe to put the question to their own voters if a debt restructuring is to happen . 
  like they should have done already in 2010 . 
  interesting that an article deploring ( the admirably coarse ) use of nazi imagery against german politicians , would [ choose nietzsche as the first paragraph of the article ... ] ( http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2011/11/friedrich_nietzsche_his_proto-nazi_eco-fascism.html ), 
  [ one a scale of 1 to alexis , i am very alexis ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3csf8r/z/csyhpqh ), 
  you just said it 's almost all inclusive ... just bring 300 euros with you . 
  people do n't get robbed in the streets ( be careful of pick-pockets though ) . 
  the alexis trojan horse :-d [ the last two weeks were all about ... ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3csf8r/z/csyhpqh ), 
   i 'm looking for last minute holidays . 
  and an interesting trip has showed up for ** a sailing holiday in greece . 
  8 days nearly all inclusive . 
  **  i 'm wondering wether this is a good idea in regards to the troubles there with the euro and debts etc. 
   has anyone just been on holiday in greece ? 
  what 's your experience ? 
  if you feel unsafe , it is better to choose another destination . 
  neither the spaniards nor the italians have it as bad as the greeks . 
  those are the only two big economies in trouble that are also big enough to truly threaten the stability of the esm .
