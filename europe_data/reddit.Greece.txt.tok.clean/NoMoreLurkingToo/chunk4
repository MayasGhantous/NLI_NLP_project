  and the people living there sure as hell wo n't wan na go through what the greeks are going through now . 
  so unless the spanish and italian governments ** fuck up as hard as ** the samaras and papandreou governments had , podemos and grilo ( ? ), 
  will never gather enough power to form a government . 
  it is a cheap excuse to say that torturing greece would persuade spain and italy to keep quiet . 
  not to mention morally abhorrent . 
  it 's the debt restructure . 
  nothing else . 
  a lot of people have called the latest proposal `` capitulation '' . 
  they could n't be more wrong . 
  the reforms proposed by syriza are * even harsher * than the 2 week old institutions proposal but they include a debt restructure clause . 
  so ** nobody ** can blame syriza anymore for not making enough concessions and if the syriza proposals * do * get rejected , it will become clear that the sole reason for that was the debt restructuring itself and nothing else . 
  so syriza can go to default ( and drachma ) and simply blame eu unwillingness for debt restructuring . 
  and no logical counter-argument could refute that .

  [ a reminder to myself of what this user is . 
  this is a stupid argument . 
  no other eu country is as close to default as greece is and i seriously doubt that * any * government would want to put itself through what syriza has been through in the last 6 months .

  he appears to be a german with a sense of humour ... do n't scare him away !, 
  hopefully they are trying to minimise damage in their electorate for making a compromise . 
  alternatively , pulling off a weak effort to be absolved in posterity for leading greece out of the ez . 
  in any case , it is political posturing . 
  [ being discussed in another thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3comx7/a_day_after_the_russian_veto_in_the_un_european/ ), 
  yeah , we were seeing great numbers on paper in greece as well until the end of 2014 , with the life of regular people getting harder and harder all the time , with no prospects of improving . 
  see , this is why we ca n't have nice things ... 
  the other post got enough attention for a sub this small . 
  why did you feel you needed to repost , and so soon at that ? 
  but something tells me that was not their final destination ... we have a very nice village called [ nea moudania ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/nwxw3 ) near thessaloniki , i suspect they ended up there . 
  i heard the new leopard 2016 gti is going to be the bomb !,

  oh good . 
  i am sure the armenian genocide will also get recognition ** any time now ** ... edit : in the us that is ... 
   after greeks who had lived in the area for centuries ** emigrated ** to trilye in the 20th century in the population exchange between greece and turkey , the church passed to private ownership .

  [ the nuclear deterrent ] ( https://youtu.be/ix_d_vmkswe?t=0m22s ) this comedy show provides very insightful remarks on the nature of nuclear war .

  `` yes , that man appears to be drowning . 
  but alas !, 
  throwing him something to hold on to might be considered littering ... '', 
   but then it becomes a circus of repeating submissions . 
  so basically in order to post an insightful article that goes against the majority opinion , i have to wait until people are sleeping or post it 30 times ? 
  how about trying to find a similar article and posting that after 30 minutes ? 
  this brakes no rules . 
  this is censorship in itself though . 
  if people insist to want to follow `` their flawed views '' , the only thing that can be done is simply work harder to try and get your own message across more often . 
  in that regard , i would simply appeal to the moderators ** not to delist duplicate submissions of which the original was heavily downvoted within the first hour ** . 
  it is important to stay vigilant against downvote brigades if we want to maintain any semblance of an impartial forum where all ideas can be discussed . 
  well , at least one positive unexpected symptom of this situation . . 
  watch this next video and tell me there is no anti-syriza bias [ the old man was a government supporter ] ( https://youtu.be/srtdngb94au ) .

  it 's only a minute long , and the worst thing it can do is broaden your perspective ...

  ah , why wait for him to give when you can take yourself yes ;-), 
  aaaaaah !, 
  i thought you meant * the armenians * committed genocide on some people !, 
  had never heard of something like that !!, 
  yeah , i would not hold my breath on the british admitting anything either ... 
   they should recognise their own genocide of natives first . 
  please give us more information on this subject , with sources if you will . 
   it might still happen if the other eu countries do n't step in it ** will ** happen unless there is a debt restructuring . 
  maybe not this year , maybe not next year but by 2020 there will be a default . 
  mathematically guaranteed . 
  and if it had happened back in 2010 , there would have been a lot more capital in the banks from the greek oligarchs that had not yet moved their capital . 
  now is a different case ... 
  wow , this hit the nail right in the head !, 
  i wish i had money to give you gold :-) ( or maybe i should save up and pay my taxes instead , i do n't know ... ), 
   if i acknowledged a mistake , apologized for it , ** paid the damages ** , whatever , it 's plain offensive to keep dragging the same old shit up every single time you ca n't win . 
  [ ahem ... ] ( https://youtu.be/hwh8yvxwa7e?t=6m4s ), 
  wish we could but a ) all wealth in cash in greece is already in euros and b ) those that had big deposits in greek banks until 2009 have gradually ( mostly ) moved their capital to some tax haven, 
  true :-), 
  [ do n't be a hypocrite ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ck1lp/russia_vetoes_move_at_un_security_council_to/cswna51 ) either both are genocides or neither . 
  because in both cases , the end result would have been the total extermination of the respective peoples . 
  and do n't give me any ** crap ** about the haag court , it could n't do shit to tito at the time . 
  the bankruptcy should have occurred in 2010 . 
  the first bail-out was worth 110 billion euros . 
  there should have never been any kind of bail-out . 
  it never was the responsibility of the eu countries ' taxpayers to finance the bad investments of any bank or hedge fund . 
  and those 110 billion matured and `` maturing '' bonds were not at greek hands ( because most of those were long term bonds ) but at the hands of speculators who only bought 3 , 6 and 12 month bonds again immediately after they expired . 
  so one speculator who bought 4 consecutive times a 3 month bond at 3 % interest within a year ** made a 12 % + ( because of the added effect of compound interest ) interest in a single year ** . 
  and this had been going on for ** years ** with the same banks and funds before the bubble burst . 
  and especially between 2008 and 2012 . who were these people ? 
  as it should n't .
