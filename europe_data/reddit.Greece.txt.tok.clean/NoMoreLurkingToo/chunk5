  it is a contrived fallacy . 
  even '' [ tu quoque ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tu_quoque ) '' is at times shaky . 
  `` it is a special case of ad hominem fallacy , which is a category of fallacies in which a claim or argument is rejected on the basis of fact about the person presenting or supporting the claim or argument . '', 
  in actual `` ad hominem '' , the accusation towards the original accuser is usually completely irrelevant to the original point . 
  example 1 : `` why would you believe him when he says he is n't feeling well , you know he is a racist ! '', 
  the fact that someone is a racist does not mean that he must lie every time they make a statement . 
  but example 2 : '' [ david duke ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/david_duke ) says that white people are victims of police brutality just as often as black people ... but honestly , would you believe ** this ** claim , made by a racist ? '', 
  in my opinion , this is not actual ad hominem since the motivations behind what duke might have said could actually be put into question [ simply by knowing who said what ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ad_hominem#non-fallacious_ad_hominem_reasoning ) . 
  yeah , i 'm sure the armenians would n't mind waiting another 100 years ... 
   hau : a greek bankruptcy would certainly have a healing effect . 
  a precarious position like the one we now have just makes everything worse . 
  many banks in greece are already broke , but are still handing out loans . 
  they get the money from the central bank and then lend it to speculators . 
  it 's ** a period of dodgy dealings that will come at the expense of the european taxpayers in the end . 
  politicians are unbelievably ** na\u00efve ** if they allow that to happen ** . 
  i do n't believe naive is the correct word .

  by / u/yolo _ swagovic2  i love how the uk passed this motion while conveniently forgetting that it helped occupy iraq for 10 years and killed some hundred thousand iraqi muslims . 
  if this user had said : `` what the serbs did was a crime but ... '' then he would be completely right . 
  but if he was trying to say that what the serbs did was not a crime because what the british did * is not treated as a crime * then he would be wrong , because both actions were criminal . 
  by / u/croatiabadblueboy146  and you are lynching negroes if this user had said : `` just admit that what happened was a crime ( as for it being a genocide , please read [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ck1lp/russia_vetoes_move_at_un_security_council_to/csw9eeu ) ) , just admit it '' then he would be completely right .

  the un appears as a standard for the conduct of nations . 
  it is important that there is consistency in their modus operandi . 
  for that reason , imho , ** they must not recognize any other event as a genocide before they ( at least ) recognise the armenian genocide ** . 
  [ from wikipedia  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tu_quoque ) `` tu quoque ( latin for `` you , too '' or `` you , also '' ) or ** the appeal to hypocrisy is an informal logical fallacy ** that intends to discredit the opponent 's position by asserting the opponent 's failure to act consistently in accordance with that position . 
  it attempts to show that a criticism or objection applies equally to the person making it . 
  this attempts to dismiss the opponent 's position based on ** criticism of the opponent 's inconsistency ** and not the position presented . 
  it is a special case of ad hominem fallacy , which is a category of fallacies in which a claim or argument is rejected on the basis of fact about the person presenting or supporting the claim or argument . 
  ** to clarify , although the person being attacked might indeed be acting inconsistently or hypocritically , such behavior does not invalidate the position presented ** . '', 
  in short , the crimes of the british do not justify the crimes of the serbs . 
  but still , where is the recognition about the crimes of the british ? 
  or about the crimes of the ** other ethnic groups that participated in the yugoslavian civil war of the 1990s ** ? 
  my point is that * maybe * the armenian genocide should be officially recognized * before * any more recent events . 
  even before what happened to the ethnically greek people who were living in asia minor , since chronologically it precedes that event as well . 
  the op put the word genocide in quotations ( about the srebrenica massacre ) , because it technically is ** not ** officially recognised by the un . 
   russia vetoes move at un security council to describe 1995 srebrenica massacre of bosnians as a `` genocide '' i ** also ** put the word genocide in quotations ( about the massacre of the armenians ) , because it ** also ** technically is ** not ** officially recognised by the un ...

  greece should 've resolved its issues before joining , but instead they joined to resolve their issues .

  you make no sense whatsoever . 
  other countries got to ** use their marshall plan funds ** during 1945 and 1949 in order to rebuild their industries and infrastructure while greece ** had to spent most of the marshall plan funds ** to buy weapons and food ** while fighting a civil war that disrupted any and all industrial and agricultural production ** . 
  name ** one ** country in europe ( west of the iron curtain ) in a worse state than greece ** in 1950 ** ( with citations please ) . 
  from the defunct wikipedia article [ you linked ] ( http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ffvjfy5mv6qj:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_economic_miracle+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us ) `` by 1950 the relative position of the greek economy had dramatically deteriorated . 
  the income per capita in purchasing power terms fell from 62 % of france 's in 1938 to about 40 % in 1949 , according to economist angus maddison . '', 
  any positive effects from the marshall plan were dwarfed from the effects of the [ massive devaluation of the drachma ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economic_history_of_greece_and_the_greek_world#post-world_war_ii ) that led to this : `` greek economy was in an extremely poor state in 1950 ( after the end of the civil war ) , with its relative position dramatically affected . 
  in that year greece had a per capita gdp of $ 1,951 , which was well below that of countries like portugal ( $ 2,132 ) , poland ( $ 2,480 ) , and even mexico ( $ 2,085 ) . 
  greece 's per capita gdp was comparable to that of countries like bulgaria ( $ 1,651 ) , japan ( $ 1,873 ) , or morocco ( $ 1,611 ) . '', 
  the ability of the greek economy to grow after 1950 was due to the fact we managed to stay in the west side of the iron curtain . 
  because of the blood sacrifice of our civil war . 
  geopolitics is a tricky business . 
   also was greece destroyed by a war ? 
  in fact it was the first benefector of the marshall plan in 1947 along with turkey . 
  yet its not the germans who want money but greeks . 
  ** greeks wasted the money ** while germans used the marshall plan to order equipment to rebuild their industry . 
  you pay instead to dump money in greece . 
  greece fought a civil war against pro-stalin communist separatists between 1945 and 1949 , and all the marshall plan money went to weapons and imported food . 
  we barely managed to avoid the fate of most of eastern europe but at a heavy price , which we are still paying to this day . 
    turning a nato member into a failed state in such a strategic location is a really , really bad move . 
   using the russia card to demand that greece should be able to get what they want from the eu is incredibly weak sauce . 
  this is the ** exact ** same argument used by germans to defend the 1953 debt write-off germany got . 
  `` if you do n't forgive our debt , the entire germany will turn into a soviet vassal '' hypocritical much ? 
  essentially , the prequels to `` the hunger games '' ... 
  isis in europe , * just * what we were missing !, 
  shhh , you 're spoiling the circlejerk ... 
  yeah , how can they possibly expect us to survive with that ?? 
  to be exact , he appeared not to have questioned the referendum itself * directly * but rather said that a `` yes '' result would not have secured the deal that was already off the table . 
  but a ) by suggesting that the greek government purposefully misguided the greek people into thinking that `` yes '' was a real option * he kinda did imply * that the referendum as a whole was `` illegitimate '' . 
  which begs the question , ** why endorse `` yes '' at all ?? 
  ** and b ) his entire point was moot , since as the ukip mep eloquently put `` no is the answer '' . 
  maybe he was expecting a `` yes '' , was ready to `` reject '' the previous deal as `` illegitimate '' but then `` no '' happened and did n't have enough time to modify his speech ... 
  [ actually , this is greece right now ] ( https://youtu.be/-dt7bx-b1mg ), 
   the eurozone ( mostly ) bought that debt at knockdown prices . 
  above market value , but for less than the loans were originally worth . 
  the eu , together with the imf , bought about 100 billion euros worth of debt ** at 100 % of its value ** ( first bailout , in 2010 ) and then most of the remaining debt at various degrees of discount ( second bailout , in 2012 ) .
