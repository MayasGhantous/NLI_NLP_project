  the remaining debt ( currently not bailed out ) is less than 5 % of the total debt and in the hands of those who chose not to sell it at any discount . 
  the haircut occured on bonds that had not matured ( and would not mature for many years in some cases ) and those holding the bonds got cash now instead keeping a paper promising more cash in the distant future ( that had been issued by a practically insolvent country ) . 
  so the haircut overall was in fact less than 30 % of the debt . 
  not bad , if we discount the fact that the haircut substantially affected the greek banks , which held a big chunk of the debt that received the haircut , and had to be in turn bailed out from the greek government ** thus re-adding several billion to the new greek debt ** . 
   i believe the majority of the debt is owned by nations and not banks now , so it 's a bit late to wish the banks went bust . 
  and i wonder where those banks are and which interests protect them ... 
   well your country has its elections on every worldwide news site aswell . 
  to be frank ** the us is generally seen as more powerful than greece ** tho i bet you would n't even pull this on turkey if they were part of the eu and in the same economic position greece is now ... 
  eat a dick asshole . 
  [ it 's all in good humour ] ( https://youtu.be/mtcwx6hxbc0 ) :-), 
  still do . 
  it would be nice to have a list of those bonds ( like there is a list for the bonds of the second haircut ) but * for some mysterious reason * i can not seem to find one ... 
  more like a jobless mid 40s housewife , that her husband calls fat all the time and is kept underfed to `` loose that big belly she 's got '' ... 
  i definitely think that if greece had not entered the eurozone , it would be much better off now . 
  but i do n't blame the eu for that . 
  and i do n't only blame the eu for our present economic situation either . 
  why do you think we are supporting syriza so much lately ? 
  we are sick of the old guard of greek politicians ( the same people the european politicians ** still ** support ) and want to put the corrupted in prison . 
  and the eu is not helping . 
  and our fellow european citizens can not seem to understand this ... 
  you missed the point . 
  the haircut affected ** all ** the bonds held by greek and cypriot investors ( and also some international investors ) as a result of the ** second ** bailout . 
  the ** first ** bailout had ** no haircut ** and almost all the bond holders were ** not greek or cypriot ** . 
  ** who were those people that got over 100 billion euros ( first bailout ) with 0 % haircut ?? 
  ** also adding , the need of ** recapitalisation ** of the ( until then reasonably healthy ) greek banks was a direct result of the haircut and ** the entire cost ** of recapitalisation ** was added back as new public greek debt ** , effectively reducing the amount in real figures of the haircut ** by at least 30 billion euros ** . 
  true , if we only count economic distribution through eu growth programmes . 
  probably true overall as well . 
  but not without any drawbacks . 
  what of lost revenue due to no import taxes ( greece imports more from the eu than it exports to the eu ) ; and damage to agricultural production due to common market practices ; and damage to the county 's industrial production due to evened out playing field etc ? 
  but the biggest mistake was , undoubtedly , joining the euro in 2000 . 
  thank you mr. simitis . 
   the creditor ** committee ** for the 2011-2012 haircut , p. 9 , is much more diverse than just `` greek banks , cypriot banks . 
  the [ committee ] ( http://imgur.com/a/yjvvg ) was `` manned '' primarily by banks , only half of the bonds that received a haircut were represented in that committee . 
  and ** all ** of the bonds that ** did n't in the end receive a haircut ** ( as seen in the lists of the same imgur album ) were ** not owned by greek or cypriot investors ** . 
  it is quite indicative of personal opinions from people who want to be informed and participate in a discussion ; and includes people from all over europe . 
  so what is the difference from a poll conducted by bild for instance ? 
  yeah that map part was pretty cool . 
  is it a google docs tool ? 
  cheers !, 
  this was the ** second ** bailout and it mostly affected greek banks , cypriot banks ( causing their own credit problems out of the blue ) and greek pension funds . 
  what was the amount of the ** first ** bailout ? 
  who were the ones that got ** all ** the money ? 
  please elaborate . 
  the post content ( the post itself is at almost +100 ) and [ a lot of the early comments ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3c74is/z/csstyxt ), 
  valid points , but remember the actual purpose behind this video : to pander in the opinions of conservative americans , and spread fear and animosity against what is today 's global boogeyman . 
   greece got $ 246 billion worth of goodwill from international taxpayers which they are threatening to not pay back , do n't be surprised if further goodwill is not forthcoming . 
  no , the european taxpayers got burdened ** by their own governments ** with ** privately held ** ( by banks who got 100 % of their money back with the first `` bailout '' ) unsustainable greek debt ; the greek populace was not allowed to have a say in whether or not to accept any bailouts ( denied the opportunity for a referendum ) . 
  [ here is a good measure of european `` goodwill '' ... ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3c74is/why_sould_we_accept_refugees_rescued_by_italy/ ), 
   goodwill there is even less goodwill in europe than money in greek atms . 
  take a look at the comments on this sub and find me this goodwill ... 
  `` for the rest of the country , drachmae connect founder lee gibson-grant suggests using a mobile banking service that greece may be able to prevent from devaluing by backing it with raw assets . 
  `` when looking at the current situation of greece it has no choice but to create a parallel currency to take the stress off of requiring bailouts , '' gibson-grant tells forbes . '', 
  sounds promising . 
  of the two ( china and russia ) , who is the most powerful ? 
  economically , china without a doubt . 
  is china working together with russia ? 
  then chinese opinion is inconsequential . 
  yes ? 
  then guess who is really calling the shots from the background ... edit : [ just look at this 4-year-old propaganda video from the us to see who they really consider to be their primary competition ... ] ( https://youtu.be/otsqozwp-rm ), 
  [ google translate in english ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.rtlnieuws.nl%2feconomie%2fhome%2froemer-dijsselbloem-heeft-gefaald-en-moet-weg&amp;edit-text= ) sounds simply like a left wing local politician capitalizing ( pun intended ) on the situation ... 
  well , that 's just a reason to love the man ever more ;-), 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/lynmzxyvvpa?t=2m52s ), 
  :d you are welcome europe !, 
  and sleep tight !, 
   what i do n't get is how no one noticed it going on . 
  if you mean the politicians , of course they knew exactly what they were doing . 
  and did not care . 
  from 1975 until 2000 the drachma had lost its value many times over . 
  and the loans were demarcated in drachmas . 
  so if things got tight , they just printed more and stole value from greeks holding cash to service the loans . 
  this was not noticed by the public because inflation has always been high and people were given raises on par with inflation . 
  the purchasing power compared with northern europe ** steadily decreased ** during the 90s but went mostly unnoticed by the public due to our geographical location ( more on this later )  is the greek system completely closed ? 
  where did people think the money was coming from ? 
  the people do n't care . 
  anywhere . 
  not until times get tough . 
  do you honestly believe the majority of your own countrypeople are genuinely involved in the political process ? 
  as long as things go well and people are told what they want to hear , they do n't give politics and nation level economics morr than a thought every 4 years . 
  and * all * politicians exploit that . 
   whenever a political party here in denmark comes up with an economical plan , it 's being reviewed by . . well , pretty much everyone . . and obviously `` the other side '' is trying hard to find any flaws in it to make the party look like they 're clueless and unfit to govern . 
  independent economist will also dissect it and be on the news , in the papers etc. 
  giving their opinions on how realistic it is etc. 
  then how do you explain your government convincing you to bail out the private banks greece was indebted to by taking on a clearly unsustainable debt ? 
  it was already at the time at 150 % of greek gsp but instead of debt restructure then and there ( which would cost the taxpayers nothing at the time ) , they got you to foot the bill . 
  ** you believed their lies as well . 
  **  someone once posted an avg . 
  salary map of europe in this sub and greece was like 2-300 % of its neighbors . 
  how did people think that was sustainable ? 
  the reason for the salary gap was the iron curtain . 
  we were spared that ( after a bloody civil war between 1945 and 1949 in which we spent all the money we got from the marshall plan ) . 
  we were spared the effects of a 45 year soviet occupation . 
  the nations around us have * still * not recovered from it . 
  our economy during that time was linked to the west and compared to the west it always was on the weak spectrum . 
  edit : another reason why things seemed to go well during the 90s is that the purchasing power of greeks compared to neighboring countries was better ; so importing goods , services , and labour from these countries helped conceal the underlying problems with the greek economy itself , while at the same time ** transferring wealth from greece ( and from europe through greece ) ** to those countries , developing their economies . 
   what could possibly make greece * that * different than . . say . . croatia ? 
  what did the politicians tell the greek population to just make them accept that everything was fine ? 
  croatia was involved in a civil war not 20 years ago , after being part of communist yugoslavia since 1945 . 
  is n't it understandable that disparities still linger ? 
  and of course their economies should be aided as well , why do people act as if greece is saying `` do n't help anyone else but me !! 1 !! '' ? 
  i think this is done purely in order to sidetrack the conversation altogether .
