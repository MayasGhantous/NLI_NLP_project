  final edit : clarifications, 
  the country which the ** overwhelming ** majority of illegal immigrants come to greece from , is turkey . 
  what would their reaction be if we started deporting people back to them ? 
  what would the eu reaction be to the possible reaction of turkey ? 
  ~ ~ he is a troll . 
  the reddit account was made * today * fairly recently . ~ ~ edit : seems i was wrong . 
  he was just being an asshole . 
  i apologize on his behalf , you said nothing that warranted that response , ~ ~ even if i disagree myself in some extent . ~ ~ edit2 : wtf , i need some sleep ... you said absolutely nothing wrong , i confused your comment with another !, 
  sorry again !, 
  do n't feed that particular troll man . 
  look at his comment history . 
  he has nothing good to say about greece and will not concede any logical points . 
  just a waste of time replying to him altogether . 
  that 's a skewed way to put it  summaries :  p. 44 a ) ecb - esm ( eurogroup ) provides new loans ( 3rd bailout ) so greece can pay off ecb this was already pretty much agreed upon with the former government back in august 2014 . 
  the need for 50-75 bn was recognised since then and was planned as a continuation of the previous ( now defunct ) 2nd bailout . 
  nothing new here . 
   b ) imf - imf gets repaid first , esm ca n't complain if greece makes extra payments to imf instead of paying esm . 
  the imf always gets its money first . 
  this was known from before the eu invited the imf to even the first bailout . 
  in any case , payments to the imf were already in place since before 2015 and meant to be found from the profits the efsf made by the loan to the previous greek governments . 
  nothing new here as well . 
   p. 45 d ) quantitative easing - once ecb is repaid using the fresh 3rd bailout loans from esm greece wants the ecb to then buy greek long term bonds ( probably 30 year bonds ) . 
  ( 4th bailout ) this is a point that needs to be clarified . 
  how much money , for what use , and under what time frame and terms . 
  it would have been useful for a journalist to have asked * this * of varoufakis during the last week . 
   p. 46 e ) financing of growth program - quantitative easing from ecb is n't enough so extra funds must be made available from european commission and european investment bank for stimulus programs . 
  basically a 4th set of eurogroup loans and a 5th bailout . 
  this sounds like simply ensuring that greece can tap funds of the [ nsrf ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/12/22/nsrf-e19-billion-for-greece-in-the-2014-2020-program/ ) that it has been unable to due to imposed budgetary restrictions . 
  nobody has come up with a solution for this and billions that could have been introduced in the greek economy during the last 5 years , producing necessary infrastructure by the way , have already been missed because greece could not find any funds to participate in any of these programmes . 
   tldr unlimited eu backed credit line for greece hardy unlimited ; very logical proposals that were dismissed ** without even the smallest of discussions ** . 
  i am sure that there would be room for compromise and rewording but v was never given the chance to discuss them at all . 
  i am sorry , and because i am apparently stupid , could you please [ point exactly where in the text ] ( http://imgur.com/a/djzq6 ) you got this quote from ? 
   p. 14-16 , retirement system , i bet the italian finance minister 's blood pressure rose at such a gradual retirement adjustment plan you are right . 
  this should be changed to a period of 5 years instead . 
   p. 39 , public sector , no mention of changes to aid in reducing overall % of public workers . 
  but does note : no further reductions in the salaries of civil servants ( would be fine if there was listed a reduction in overall numbers ) . 
  you are right . 
  this should be changed accordingly . 
   in terms of streamlining business licensing and management most of the paragraphs focus on `` a study will be commissioned '' . 
  a study needs to be commissioned but for the time being , the method used in ( for example ) ireland could be adopted , with future changes to be discussed . 
   finally , p.44-45 , greece requests that the other eu member nations extend their crisis loan credit to buyout greece 's ecb obligations ( 3rd bailout ) . 
  they will then suspend all required repayments and exercise none of their legal rights to demand such payments while greece pays back the imf at a rate that will be chosen solely at the discretion of greece . 
  greece will then apply to the ecb for participation in the qe program so they can provide cheap liquidity to greek banks without much oversight , all while continuing to not make any payments on the esm ( eu country backed ) loans . 
  ( no date given for when eu would be `` allowed '' to request installment payments of esm ) < - is that really the best way to go about asking for debt restructuring . 
  i mean as the opening proposal from a government that is on its 2nd bailout . 
  and this is the ** real ** reason the greek proposal was rejected . 
  so , everyone , please stop pretending that it has anything to do with measures not taken by the greek government . 
  focus on discussing the real issue . 
  well , we will just have to wait and see , wo n't we ? 
  and i bet that referenda wo n't even be allowed . 
  `` a pound of flesh '' . 
  when everyone asks you to leave , you should go . 
  quite simple . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3c8luc/z/cstb5xv promise to read it ? 
  since 1975 , for 40 long years , greece was ruled by either one of two political parties : nd and pasok . 
  they seemed to be in constant ideological struggle , turning people against each other and causing strife amongst the populace . 
  the greek people had trusted each of them , because they simulated prosperity ( with borrowed money ) but they stole ** billions ** behind our backs . 
  and during the last 7 years , after the jig to what they had been doing was finally up , they suddenly forgot all their `` differences '' and covered each other 's backs . 
  and do you know who helped them cover their backs ? 
  the european political system . 
  and they still do . 
  you go ahead and trust your future in their hands . 
  i think i 'll hold mine in my own . 
  the implications of what * could have been * in afghanistan and what * could become * of greece are too depressing to contemplate ... 
  how about this : http://www.iefimerida.gr/sites/default/files/protasi_draft.pdf, 
  well , given the recent divorce-to-new-marriages ratio , i 've got to say that `` in sickness and in health '' is n't what it used to be ... 
  guess you 're stuck with us then . 
  unless you make your own referendum of course , you have every right to . 
  http://www.iefimerida.gr/sites/default/files/protasi_draft.pdf here it is in english . 
  yup , sorry again . 
  [ here ] ( http://aftovi2.27210.gr/mediafiles/2015/06/final_greek_proposal_aftodioikisi.pdf ) is the version in greek , i am looking for the english text , hold on ... 
  did you by any chance read it as well ? 
  one per each . 
  we , under bankruptcy , did it in a week . 
  they can take a month if it is to much of a problem . 
  so , what you are saying is complete debt write-off if we exist the ez-eu ?? 
  where do i sign ?!, 
   dear uk ,  to be fair you did allow hitler into the power in the first place because ** of the too harsh sanctions ** after the ww1 . 
   ~ finland dear finland , do you mean to say that tough economic sanctions may cause adverse reactions ? 
  ~ greece, 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3c4lo3/z/cssbe4o edit : oops , i meant this : http://s.kathimerini.gr/resources/article-files/protasi--2.pdf, 
  agreed . 
  if indeed every eu country has a ** referendum ** and it is decided that greece should exit the eurozone ( or even the eu entirely ) , the greek people should respect their wishes . 
  they would still have to pay taxes . 
  ** farmers ** have always paid taxes in greece , no matter what you have been hearing ... and to get any oil ( or pesticides , or parts ) , they would have to produce more than they consume . 
  did n't say it would be easy . 
  there is still know-how in farming and a lot of equipment currently underused ( for subsidised wheat ) , as well as local crops that are more suitable for cultivation . 
  the international markets are not closed to us , the problem is liquidity . 
  but pesticides and tractor parts are not such a big expense . 
  i am much more worried about medicine . 
  maybe have to switch to generics , hopefully of not so doubtful effectiveness ... 
  look , i apologized already , what else do you want me to say ? 
  sorry for thinking in my own language and misusing the borrowed words whose meaning is changed in the language that has adopted them ... 
  alright !, 
  pass the responsibility of such a decision to them , by all means ... 
  great . 
  make it official . 
   no , in a representative democracy like germany , the bundestag does represent the democratic will of the german people , a referendum is not required for every issue . 
  you 're thinking of a direct democracy like switzerland ( which is actually a mix between direct & representative ) . 
  i 'm sorry , i forgot you guys have been giving other meanings to the greek words you are using in your own languages .
