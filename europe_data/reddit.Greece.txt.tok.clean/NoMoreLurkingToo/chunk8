  around here , by * democracy * we mean that the people make their own decisions , directly . 
  we just experienced some true democracy in our own country for the first time in decades . 
  we hope you get to experience that privilege yourselves soon as well , instead of leaving the important decisions of your nation to a handful of people . 
  not much , we 're just their largest trading partner . 
  i 'm sure they 'll be just fine . 
  nothing uglier than what we have been hearing in this sub for the past month , i am certain . 
   der untergang of greece that sounds nice , thanks !, 
  i think i 'll call myself that from now on !, 
  how do you pronounce it ? 
  we just simply need to start growing food again . 
  greece imported merely 5 % of its food until 1980 . 
  if cuba can do it so can we . 
  time will tell . 
  then we will have to manage somehow . 
  the greek people took an informed decision today . 
  the situation as was , was unbearable . 
  so we leap to the abyss and hope for the best . 
  we wish you all the best as well . 
  #good riddance, 
  yep . 
  but it 's a small place and further information would effectively dox me :-) pm me if you want some specific information, 
  if the german people decide ( through a referendum ) they do not want to be in a union together with the greek people , the greek people will respect their decision . 
   greece has to suffer to save the eu how about ... #no, 
  nope . 
  that is called a * referendum * . 
  you guys should have one too . 
  finland is a great option , although i heard they are just about to start charging foreign students a nominal fee . 
  [ have a look ] ( http://portal.savonia.fi/amk/en ) and try giving them a call maybe +35817 255 6000, 
  crawling back under their rocks ? 
  hope tsip finally whips out the lagarde list now and starts throwing them to jail . 
  just goes to show the extent of the attempted brainwashing . 
  did they do it on purpose ? 
  surely they must have suspected such a reaction in nd/pasok after all the shenanigans ? 
  [ even better ] ( https://youtu.be/wq5hihh0-mu ), 
  [ pretty much self-explanatory ] ( https://youtu.be/mdolavijdz8 ) ... `` instead of chasing him around , '' ( meaning , instead of doing anal ) `` get him a pipe , as a gift '' ( meaning , do oral ) `` diana , the no1 pipe '' ( meaning , she gives the best head ), 
  that was great :d [ relevant ] ( https://youtu.be/nal9oygyxog ), 
  who made this troll account today ? 
  for what purpose ? 
  obvious troll, 
  i have had immigrants in my home for coffee , i did at least that . 
  how about you ? 
  and i was hoping to be able to converse with actual human beings , so far disappointed . 
  if ** any ** european country claims it can not afford to house and feed a few thousand people fleeing war and butchery , it is ** blatantly lying ** . 
  what percentage of people is fair for each country to take can be determined and adjusted . 
  and in some cases maybe subsidised . 
  but telling people in need to effectively go fuck themselves because it is a hassle to keep them alive is inhuman . 
  plain and simple . 
   does human decency include earlier retirement ? 
  what the ** fuck ** does `` earlier retirement '' have to do with immigrants ???!!!, 
  you fucking people make no sense at all , fuck off back to / r/european already !!, 
  human decency , how does it work ? 
   honestly , though , having grown up in late-communist / early-post-communist romania , i * really * do n't wish that on anybody . 
  i shudder to think that anybody who lived through 80s-90s romania would ever want anybody else to go through that . 
  we have heard the horror stories from greek people who lived there and were repatriated after the soviet collapse . 
  anyone who wishes such fate to other people generates revulsion to me . 
   i think op meant to say `` romania had it so much worse , so stop complaining greece '' , which i personally disagree with , but i know a lot of people do n't - just because someone has/had it worse does n't make other tragedies any less ... tragic . 
  while true that people really did go through harder times then , especially combined with the police state and lack of basic freedom , i find people rejoicing in other people 's misery reprehensible regardless of their own past experiences . 
  the most horrible thing to have happened in living memory is ww2 , so from there i will take an example : how humane ( or , clearly not ) would have been for the people who were victimised by the nazis , to exalt in the misery of the german people immediately post-war ? 
   i really hope an agreement acceptable to all parties involved can be reached , because the alternative will hurt everybody involved . 
  amen . 
  by people who have tasted them :-), 
  [ and all thanks to this great man . 
  yeah , i 'm sure your job is * a lot * tougher than calculating a myriad different variables that could derail your whole plan and potentially cost hundreds if not thousands of people to suffer ... 
  yeah , thank the americans . 
   that 's the proposal to the institutions from end of june . 
  thank you for the link , but i 've already read the whole thing a week ago . 
  this was supposed to be the compromise in order to receive more funds . 
  it 's basically what they thought those institutions would like to hear . 
  it was the last proposal from the greek government to the institutions before negotiations broke down . 
  there is no newer proposal by the greek government than this ( made public at least ) . 
  this is the proposal they hoped the institutions would accept as a common ground solution . 
   but it is a ) rather vague ( everything besides the pension reform and some budgetary measures is left open and even those seem more like a patching up than a serious effort to tackle fundamental problems ) , b ) short-term oriented and c ) obviously not the party 's long term vision but just the result of the negotiations with the creditors . 
  a ) there seem to be exact figures for each point , hardly vague i should think . 
  what exactly makes you think it is vague ? 
  b ) the proposals are to be fully implemented by 2020 and remain in place indefinitely ( unless a revision is deemed needed by both sides i guess ) . 
  the measures to be implemented would steadily produce results in the following decades , hardly short-term oriented . 
  and in any case , equivalent to the ones proposed by the institutions . 
  c ) true . 
  more on that later . 
   i 've listed some questions i had in another comment here - i 'm particularly interested in industry and business reforms ( i.e. 
  * \u03b1 ) * what type of industry do they aim to attract , * \u03b2 ) * who will finance infrastructure , * \u03b3 ) * what to do with the trade balance deficit , * \u03b4 ) * what 's the development strategy and things like that ) . 
  \u03b1 ) what was hinted at was that the construction industry could be restarted using the offered eu funds that greece would be allowed to tap , with reduced own budgetary contribution to be agreed with in the final proposal . 
  these are funds going to all peripheral countries for development but which greece had no access to during the last 6 years because of not being able to afford * any * budgetary contribution . 
  so all the funds went to other peripheral countries that could afford to contribute their 10 % of each project 's budget ( such as bulgaria and romania ) . 
  \u03b2 ) the eu fund together with the greek budget contribution \u03b3 ) good question , especially in view of the sanctions against russia . 
  finland is facing the same problem . 
  remains to be seen i guess . 
  \u03b4 ) see next . 
   is there any manifesto that provides some clarity on issues like that ? 
  because that proposal does n't and i , personally , think that whether or not to comply with some bail out criteria is certainly an important issue , but the fate of greece 's future will be decided by providing sound economic reform in order to turn that awful recession around for good . 
  that 's what i expect a party to have a vision on . 
  well , you are very correct to point out that syriza has not produced ( to the best of my knowledge ) any such manifesto , at least in the form of a written , concise booklet that i could refer you to . 
  but as stated above , bits and pieces were hinted during interviews and the entire mentality of this leftist party is contrary to such measures in a philosophical level ( anti-capitalist ) , enough so as to create internal upheaval if found to be too `` reactionary '' . 
  so it could be a combination of calculated neglect and actual neglect ... 
  still a better choice than any other option in the greek political system , sad to say ... 
  http://s.kathimerini.gr/resources/article-files/protasi--2.pdf here you go . 
  enjoy . 
  my apologies . 
  ~ ~ what do you do , spike them with rubbing alcohol ? 
  you can get blind like that you know ... ~ ~ yeah , looks like it 's not * them * doing that after all ...
