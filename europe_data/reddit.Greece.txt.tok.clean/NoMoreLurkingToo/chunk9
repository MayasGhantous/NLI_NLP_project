  probably should be `` european country '' . 
  and i believe that the reason for spending so much on american arms are the f-16s and apache helicopters ( together with their accessories ... ), 
  ** `` food staples , such as sugar and flour , were also fast running out on friday ** *** as consumers started to feel the effect of the restrictions . 
  '' *** ** when did the consumers get to feel any of the effects already ? 
  ** this article is full of exaggeration and blatant lies !, 
  it is trying to make people think there are shortages ** felt by the general public at this very moment ** when this is ** clearly not true ** . 
  i do not know what is to happen in a week 's time ** but nothing is happening at the moment , nothing is happening now ! ** . 
  why do you insist to shift the subject in the future ? 
  i have not argued against the ** speculation ** of what ** might ** happen ** in the future ** , i am talking about the present . 
  and ** presently ** , there are ** no shortages effecting the general public ** . 
  [ neville chamberlain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neville_chamberlain ) was also elected and he signed the [ munich agreement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/munich_agreement ) . 
  are the british people responsible for appeasement ? 
  you quote the article itself , about shortages in very specific medicine in very specific retailers ( cherry-picked examples ) and speculation about * future * shortages in other items . 
  why has there not been any ** confirmation ** by the general public of shortages they ** experienced themselves ** ? 
  simply because the general public ** has not experienced any shortages as of yet ** . 
  what * may * come in the future is different from what is being reported as happening ** now ** . 
  if you had bothered to read the title of the imgur album , you would have read that those were comments in the guardian article posted here , of people ** living ** in greece and who have ** actually been ** to the supermarkets . 
  there was ** not a single comment ** saying there were actual shortages in the same article , only the scaremongering of the `` journalist '' who put her name on those lies . 
  this is bullshit . 
  we were forced to abandon our families , our friends , our country because the only other choice was to starve . 
  we received an education in greece and not given the opportunity to pay it back by helping the economy grow and continuing the cycle with the next generation . 
  instead our country is being condemned to shrivel and we are condemned to see it from afar . 
  the guy running the soup kitchen pays for foodstuffs out of his own pocket . 
  people living here barely have enough money to feed themselves , it 's not a workforce problem running a soup kitchen ; it 's funding it that is the issue . 
  hundreds of thousands already have , me and 3 other members of my family included . 
  hundreds of thousands will as well in the coming years . 
  all the young workers who could have contributed in restoring the greek economy and ensuring that the pension funds in greece wo n't go belly up , will strengthen instead other european nations ' economies and work towards those pension funds . 
  that 'll help greece no doubt ... 
  the greek humanitarian crisis is at ** your ** doorstep , why do n't ** you ** lend a hand instead of offering sarcasm ? 
  yeah , why not help only the people near your doorstep and let everyone else die ? 
  i expect you to tell me why other opinion pieces that express the opposite view are treated as fact and voted to the top . 
  no comments eh ? 
  just downvotes ? 
   ` obedient ' may sound bad , but it 's the perfect word to use . 
   when i get a loan i have to comply with whatever the bank/creditor says . 
  if they offer unreasonable conditions i do n't have to take the loan . 
   and to some degree it 's the greeks fault : someone in greece voted for the previous government and this one . 
   sorry to sound like a dick , but noone forced greece to take the bailout money . 
  greece ** was not allowed ** to hold ** a referendum ** before the first two bailout deals . 
  if greece defaulted then ( 2009 ) there would be no debt to a esm ( effectively to other nations ) and the blow would have been taken directly from the banks that held the greek bonds instead of european taxpayers directly . 
  the eu recently renewed the sanctions against russia and none of the eu members objected . 
  so as a response , russia renewed their own counter-sanctions against the eu , probably also adding a few more for good measure ... 
  yup , got it . 
  happened again to greece as well . 
  tonnes of fruit and vegetables bound for the russian market rotting away in greek warehouses ... 
  omg ... the british always did have dry humour but combined with climate change ... 
   so pro-eu because the eu is beneficial in certain ways ? ... 
  `` the right thing '' might as well just be `` the right thing for greece in the long term '' . 
  more like `` the right thing for europe as a whole '' . 
  disunity has brought war and woe in our continent for millennia , with the most recent example still in living memory . 
     so pro-eu because it 's benifical , but anti-eu when bills are due ? 
    pro-eu because its the right thing . 
  anti-eu in the methods of dealing with matters at hand . 
    your comment is ignorant . 
   you basically said the same thing . 
  the first sentence might as well be a copy and i guess phrasing is as `` anti-eu when bills are due '' makes it sound a bit worse than '' anti-eu in the methods of dealing with matters at hand . '', 
  but it 's hardly worlds apart . 
  `` so pro-eu because it 's benifical '' = / = `` pro-eu because its the right thing '' being a part of the eu is beneficial * in some * respects but * not in all * respects . 
  doing `` the right thing '' means also dealing with the drawbacks of your decision , not only enjoying the advantages of it . 
  greece has opted out of ( virtually ) none of the clauses that restrict its independence in favour of a more complete european unification . 
  whether that was a mistake or not is yet to be determined ...  `` anti-eu when bills are due '' makes it sound a bit worse than '' anti-eu in the methods of dealing with matters at hand . '', 
  it is a different thing to acknowledge a debt and agree to pay it by selling your car and cutting out all luxuries , and quite another to be asked to sell your shoes and stop feeding your children . 
   [ ... ] but hey that 's just my opinion as strong independent finland who takes no shit from no man and pays for half the dates xd so join nato then , what 's stopping you ? 
  [ a little insight ... ] ( https://youtu.be/zswnelyw1ce?t=18m17s ), 
  ( i tried to make a `` this is sparta '' joke mate ... ), 
   i am even supporting same stuff like syriza !, 
  the apocalypse is upon us !, 
  [ reddiquette ] ( https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette ) state your reason for any editing of posts . 
  edited submissions are marked by an asterisk ( * ) at the end of the timestamp after three minutes . 
  for example : a simple `` edit : spelling '' will help explain . 
  this avoids confusion when a post is edited after a conversation breaks off from it . 
  if you have another thing to add to your original comment , say `` edit : and i also think ... '' or something along those lines . 
  edit : and some people , such as myself , use a phone app , such as reddit is fun , that does not show an asterisk . 
  you mean to say there are ** no ** germans who deny the holocaust ? 
  or should other people think ** all ** germans deny the genocide commited because some of them do ? 
  edit : and it is good to put `` edit '' when you ** edit ** your posts ... 
  in the case of serbia , as well as any new country to enter the eu in the future , all i have written is absolutely true . 
  so you are either intentionally misleading when simplistically claiming that `` eu = / = ez '' or simply refusing to understand the situation . 
  [ false ] ( http://europa.eu/about-eu/basic-information/money/euro/index_en.htm ) . 
  all eu members must join the eurozone eventually * and it is a prerequisite to first accept of joining the eurozone in the future before any new country can join the eu at all . 
  * except those countries that have already opted out ( the uk and denmark ) for which things are more complicated . 
   with the shit slavs write on the internet you can never be sure . 
  that 's kinda racist man , lumping the views and actions of all people together just because they belong in the same ethnic group . 
  hope you were just kidding . 
  it would be similar to saying `` ca n't trust those germans not to commit another genocide '' ... 
     i suggest you look up the definition of whataboutism . 
      this is about comparing two defaults that were both brought about from the irresponsible actions of these two respective countries . 
     agreed . 
      and ** today 's generation in each respective country is equally responsible ( or not ) for the actions of those that went before them ** . 
     ** disagreed . 
  **   let 's suppose that your grandfather shot my grandfather . 
  how is this your fault ? 
    let 's suppose my father stole your father 's wallet . 
  how is this my fault ? 
   what point are you trying to make ? 
  ** no one is to blame but the person in action ** . 
  do you see the contradiction in what you are saying ? 
  let 's suppose that your grandfather shot my grandfather . 
  how is this your fault ? 
  let 's suppose my father stole your father 's wallet .
