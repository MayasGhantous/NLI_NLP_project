  will that make me similar to japanese nationalists ? 
   so ... why the opposition to an independent reunified macedonia in which all of its residents can have pride in the history of the nation ? 
  why in the world would we want to leave the rest of our greek nation in order to form an artificial , bilingual country with a group of bulgarians that are in no way related to us ? 
  just because they falsely call themselves macedonians ? 
  if , theoretically , egypt decided to rename itself to `` the republic of crete '' tomorrow , and claim to be the heirs of all the history of crete , and also claim that the people of island of crete are `` fake '' cretans , what sould cretans do ? 
  leave the rest of greece and form an `` independent reunified '' crete with the egyptians ? 
  does this make any sense ? 
  as a macedonian , i see cretans as my brothers , because we 're both greeks . 
  but the people of the country at the north are nothing but foreigners to me . 
   i 'm not quite sure why greek macedonians see the slavs of ( fyr ) macedonia as foreigners who they have nothing in common with , when ** those slavs , despite being primarily descended from foreigners ** , have tried so hard to assimilate into the native macedonian culture . 
  why do we see them as foreigners even though they are foreigners ? 
  i think you awnsered your own question . 
  it 's because they are . 
  and as i 've already mentioned , they did not try to assimilate into the macedonian culture ( and we do n't want them to , either ) . 
  they still speak bulgarian , actually , and behind all the fake `` macedonian '' masks , they are not much different than the rest of the bulgarians . 
  we wo n't abandon our brothers in the rest of greece and merge with foreigners , simply because these foreigners have an identity crisis . 
  there would be no logic behind that . 
  we 've been here for thousands of years . 
  they only moved in recently . 
  i 'm disappointed ... 
  she has no feet !, 
  it must have been the longest comment of my life , by the way . 
  ok , i do n't know if you are trolling right now , but i 'll awnser anyway . 
  macedonians are the greeks that live in the greek region of [ macedonia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/location_map_of_macedonia_%28greece%29.svg/693px-location_map_of_macedonia_%28greece%29.svg.png ) . 
  we are descended in part from the ancient macedonians , but also from other greeks who moved here at some point in history . 
  the ancient macedonians were the greeks that lived in the kingdom of macedonia , which is roughly the same region as the modern region in greece . 
  they spoke a dialect of ancient greek , worshiped the greek gods ( mount olympus , the greek mountain where the greek gods lived , is , after all , in macedonia ) , had greek customs and considered themselves macedonians and greeks at the same time , just like athenians considered themselves athenians and greeks at the same time , spartans considered themselves spartans and greeks at the same time etc. , you get the point . 
  thus , to be a macedonian , one has to be a greek , just like one has to be a greek to be an athenian . 
  now , almost a thousand years after the death of alexander the great , bulgars , a tribe from central asia arrived in the balkans and mixed with some of the slavic tribes that had arrived in the balkans recently , a little before the bulgars . 
  and so , the bulgarian people was formed , with the language of the slavs prevailing over that of the bulgars . 
  with the expansion of the ottoman empire , both greeks ( including the macedonians , who were greeks , as i 've already said ) and bulgarians fell under the control of the turks , for a few hundred years , but then the greeks revolted , and so did other people in the balkans . 
  the ottoman empire was falling and the balkans were being liberated . 
  when macedonia and the region around it was liberated , it would be annexed by either greece , serbia or bulgaria . 
  this would be decided in the struggle for macedonia , an armed conflict , mainly between greeks and bulgarians . 
  because they wanted the region , which was called macedonia before they came here , the bulgarians who lived in the wider region of macedonia called themselves macedonians , even though they were really bulgarians and had no connection to the ancient people . 
  ultimately , the place that is now called f.y.r.o.m. 
  was annexed by yugoslavia and the bulgarians that lived there , who identified as `` macedonian-bulgarians '' , were seperated by the rest of the bulgarians , who had a country outside of yugoslavia . 
  the yugoslavian policy wanted the bulgarians in what is now f.y.r.o.m. 
  to have no bulgarian sentiment , to avoid them wanting to leave yugoslavia and merge with bulgaria . 
  so they pushed the `` macedonian '' identity more . 
  after almost a century of being under yugoslavia , these people no longer considered themselves to be bulgarians , but macedonians , even though they speak a bulgarian dialect , so when yugoslavia was dissolved and this new country was formed , it called itself `` macedonia '' , while the real macedonia was just south of it , in greece . 
  because of this , after greece reacted , they had to change their name to `` former yugoslav republic of macedonia '' ( which is also wrong ) , to avoid confusion with the real macedonia . 
  they used the sun of vergina , an ancient macedonian symbol , on their flag , but greece opposed this , as an ancient macedonian symbol is , by definition , greek . 
  so they decided to copy the flag of the imperial navy of japan instead , i do n't know why . 
  after that , they went on to present themselves as macedonians , by building statues , or naming their airports after alexander the great , and calling their kids `` alexandar '' . 
  now to awnser your question about uniting the `` two macedonian peoples '' . 
  there are no two macedonian peoples . 
  only one , in greece . 
  macedonians are greeks . 
  the other people , the non-greeks who call themselves `` macedonians '' are not really macedonians , as explained above . 
  they are bulgarians who lost their identity and stole a foreign one . 
  we do not consider them our brothers , or `` fellow macedonians '' . 
  they are not related to us . 
  in fact , we do n't like the that they are stealing our history like that , and they do n't like us , because in their eyes , greece is `` occupuing macedonia '' . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : they 're not macedonians . 
  we are . 
  the only thing we have in common is a few kilometres of border . 
  no , man . 
  that 's not the problem . 
  the problem is that non-greeks are plagiarising greek history and identity . 
  they do n't only claim the land , but they claim to be actual macedonians , like philip or alexander . 
  just because part of their slavic-speaking country rests on part of the region of macedonia , does n't mean the country is macedonia . 
  today , turks live in ionia , a historically greek region , like macedonia . 
  this fact does n't make them ionians . 
  they ca n't claim the name or the identity of ionians , because it would be wrong . 
  if we expelled the population of rome , and went to settle there , we would have no right to call ourselves romans and claim to be the descendants of ancient romans . 
  so no , even if they have no real claims for `` southern '' macedonia , they are still stealing greek history . 
  well , yeah . 
  they 're all just nominal socialists . 
  nazis , n.korea , the u.s.s.r. , everyone . 
  but he was a socialist , too . 
  or so he said . 
  it 's been my honour to set you up . 
  well , the whole building moved a little to the right . 
  that , or he 's not holding the photo correctly . 
  cyprus , montenegro and albania , too . 
  this is so cringy ... 
  well , it 's not a joke , but i 'm glad you laughed . 
  the other person is right . 
  only a fraction of the former yugoslav vardarska banovina is pard of the ancient kingdom of macedonia . 
  of course , during the roman , eastern roman and ottoman empires , regions were altered and widened for administratione purposes , but historically speaking , macedonia was never up there . 
  and macedonians never spoke bulgarian . 
  i was replying sarcastically to trollish comments . 
  no need to cringe . 
  are you ok man ? 
  do you want me to call the waambulance for you ? 
  we are still using it today . 
  not officially though . 
  still it is placed on many official buildings here in macedonia . 
  [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/flag_of_greek_macedonia.svg ) is the flag of macedonia . 
  the chart is evidence to you ? 
  they did n't even spell yugoslavia properly up there ... 
  they called it `` yuguslavia '' and you still trust it ? 
  no it 's not . 
  macedonia is not a country . 
  macedonia is a region in greece . 
  it was never part of yugoslavia . 
  new york - u.s.a. 
  pick one . 
  see how silly this sounds ?
