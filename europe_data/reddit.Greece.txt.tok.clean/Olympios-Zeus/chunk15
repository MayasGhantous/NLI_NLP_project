  am i judging them based on skin colour ? 
  i 'm just saying they are not syrians . 
  now , obviously this only applies to some and not all . 
  some look arabic ( could be syrians , iraqis but also saudis , egyptians , we ca n't know ) , but since people who are obviously not syrians are making it through the border , it means that anyone is allowed . 
  honestly , i 've never heard of people being stopped or returned . 
  they all pass . 
  are they all refugees ? 
  are you telling me nobody tried to exploit the situation to get to europe ? 
  multiple millions ? 
  how many would that be ? 
  but we , the people , never saw any of that money . 
  we are only paying . 
  why should we ? 
  you just pirated paper data !, 
  what creditors ? 
  the whole debt thing is between banks . 
  the people simply pay for it . 
  you 're right , what i should have said is that i do n't want my country to be in this terrible union . 
  if you want to stay , that 's none of my business . 
  but it 's not because i dislike the e.u. 
  it 's because the e.u. 
  and it 's not up to me to leave . 
  if it was , i would have . 
  the biggest problem about the e.u. 
  is that it exists . 
  the best solution is its * dis * solution . 
  and i say this because we were thrown in this union without being asked , we were given a destructive currency without being asked and now decisions are made about us and we are - again - not asked . 
  trust me , i 've seen what kind of `` syrians '' are coming here . 
  black `` syrians '' , pakistani `` syrians '' , bangladeshi `` syrians '' ... basicly , not syrians . 
  and the fact that they are here means that the recognition methods you described are not used , so really , anyone can pass , as long as they say they are refugees . 
  no proof needed . 
  ca n't you see this can be exploited ? 
  if they had to spread somewhere to make it easier for the host countries to provide for them , would n't it make more sense to do it in muslim/arabic countries ? 
  i thought your previous comment was sarcastic . 
  what do you mean ? 
  it 's not . 
  it 's in `` home '' . 
  that 's what they call it . 
  i do n't really know , to be honest . 
  the way i see it , they are immigrants who want to show how much they feel europe to be their home , by removing a historical name which does n't nessecerily include them or their culture . 
  for example , `` europe '' was never associated with hijabs , but their `` home '' is . 
  the sign held by the man in the middle reads : `` some call it europe we call it home '' . 
  it means `` some call it europe we call it home '' in english , and it signifies that some people call europe ` europe ' , while the people on the picture refer to it as ` home ' . 
  thanks !, 
  i imagined it was something like that , but it 's very decorated , so i thought it was something else . 
  what is that cylindrical thing in the corner ? 
  how did you reach that conclusion ? 
  it 's only disputed by turks , so i do n't care . 
  not really . 
  why do you ask ? 
  officially , it 's a country , yes . 
  interesting , thanks !, 
  nice explanation !, 
  thanks for taking the time to do this . 
  by the way , is `` juhu '' , for `` south '' related to ** yugo ** slavia ? 
  i see , thanks !, 
  could you understand some of it ? 
  recognizing a country has nothing to do with how much it has in common with you . 
  it 's a disputed country . 
  when a non-european `` country '' has more wins than you in a european contest ... 
  when a non-european `` country '' has more wins than you in a european contest ... 
  better than you , yes . 
  and now the country is in a 300 billion euro debt because your father bought a new car ? 
  because many fathers bought new cars ? 
  portugal , spain , italy and cyprus , too ? 
  does n't add up . 
  the debt is different than that . 
  it was created because of loans that the people never even saw . 
  it all went to the banks . 
  and no , not all of us had new cars . 
  some of us have the same one car for 20 years . 
  if you had put some politician in the comic , it would make more sense , but this ... 
  being blamed ( and sometimes hated ) for things you did n't do is not a joke . 
  it 's a real shame seeing a greek uploading this kind of propaganda . 
  so , after denying your other comment , now you are denying your swear words ? 
  that 's low . 
  also , if i wanted to report you , i would have , i did n't need your permission to do that . 
  anyway , i have already wasted enough of my time on this conversation which consists primarily of you denying things you 've said , swearing and providing cheap excuses . 
  i 'm not the authority to tell you what to do and say . 
  if you want to spread anti-greek statements in as many threads as you can , go ahead and do that . 
  but do n't dig up old comments to ask me why i shared my thoughts about you to another person who had the same thoughts and then getting mad because i awnsered . 
  you know very well why i thought you 're not greek . 
  and if you 're really a greek and are offended of me doubting that , then the fact that i 'm not the only one to do so should alarm you . 
  have a nice day . 
  nice swear words !, 
  that 's a great way to make a point !, 
  especially when you do n't do it in english , so that the mods do n't get you !, 
   i did n't cherrypick a few bad things you said among good ones . 
  i would say that 9 out of 10 comments you make about greece are bad , from what i 've seen . 
  here 's a couple of other examples : describing the national dress of the greeks as `` an ugly a ** costume '' is an anti-greek statement . 
  saying cypriots are not greeks is an anti-greek statement . 
  who am i to say these things ? 
  ask a few random greeks and hear what they have to say . 
  about the crisis , if you said that it is your * opinion * that we had * part of the blame * and proceded to try to prove it , i would n't think that you 're prejudiced against greece . 
  what you said , though , was something along the lines of : ` we caused it . 
  deal with it ' . 
  that is an anti-greek statement , yes . 
  the fact that you 're denying your comment about people in northern epirus ( which you referred to as `` south albania '' , how greek of you ... ) being hellenized albanians is beyond pathetic . 
  here it is : https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/61hxnu/map_of_ethnic_albanian_population_within_the/dfevewl/ i was not stalking your profile . 
  i was unfortunate enough to stumble upon your anti-greek comments while browsing threads .
