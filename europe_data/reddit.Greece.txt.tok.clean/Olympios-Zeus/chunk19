  i usually do n't comment at all . 
  the reason i referred to genocides `` even on this post about ataturk '' is simply * because * it is about ataturk . 
  he had an active role in them . 
  this is n't just a usual post about turkey that i decided to use to spread hate against turks . 
  this post is about a man who was highly responsible for thousands of deaths , the suffering of my ancestors and the brutal removal of a 3000 + years old population from its native land , destroying one of the most historic cities in the process . 
  thanks for the downvotes , too . 
  -12 is my record i think . 
  of course he 's rolling in his grave . 
  his country has n't committed a major genocide lately . 
  why is `` var-fle '' on the scoreboard in latin and not cyrillic ? 
  definately not greek . 
  i have seen a ton of anti-greek comments from this guy . 
  what ? 
  so turkey is in europe and russia is n't ? 
  paeonia and dardania would be equally wrong , since these names were used for states that existed in this region thousands of years before bulgars and slavs came here to form the bulgarian people . 
  yes , these people in the so called `` republic of macedonia '' are actually bulgarians . 
  the slavic language they speak is simply a dialect of bulgarian . 
  that said , most people in greece , myself included , call that country `` skopia '' , after its capital city skopia ( `` skopje '' in their language ) . 
  the official name that greece uses to refer to it is , '' \u03a0.\u0393.\u0394.\u039c . '', 
  which is the greek version of `` f.y.r.o.m. '' . 
  but this is also wrong , since the `` m '' stands for `` macedonia '' , which is not theirs . 
  the country could be called skopia/skopje , vardarska ( a geographic term , meaning region around the vardar river ) , or they can simply chose a name themselves , as long as it 's not already taken . 
  i am macedonian . 
  i was born and raised in macedonia and i currently live in macedonia . 
  there is no such thing as a `` macedonian ministry of foreign affairs '' , because we are simply a region within greece . 
  ministries here exist only on a national level , not subnational . 
  there is only a greek mfa . 
  subnational regions like macedonia , the peloponnese , crete etc. 
  do n't have ministries . 
  haha , this actually crossed my mind !, 
  we 'll never know !, 
  but i understand .

  i once changed my keyboard to hungarian and german , years ago , because of a conversation i was having about keyboards with a hungarian and an austrian friend online . 
  years later , i find my self speaking about the same thing , with another hungarian and another austrian . 
  what a coincidence !, 
  is that a qwertz keyboard ? 
  can i jury them ? 
  wait ... you mean you press `` shift + 4 '' for '' !, 
  catholic serbs/orthodox croatians !, 
  he fought against the ottomans . 
  the ottomans , who would be supported by the albanians some centuries later . 
  are you telling me that his biographer called him prince of the epirotes just because he `` added epirus to his territory '' but forgot to call him albanian ? 
  in the frontpage of his book ? 
  now * this * is hilarious !, 
  the kastrioti family was greek , yes . 
  at some point they migrated to italy . 
  and he lived in the same period as kastriotis , so he knew better . 
  true . 
  interesting ... :(, 
  exactly . 
  not at all !, 
   skanderbeg was not his real name . 
  his real name was georgios kastriotis , which is a greek name . 
  the nickname `` skanderbeg '' is a different rendering of `` iskender bey '' which means `` lord alexander '' in turkish , given to him by the ottomans , comparing him to alexander the great , who was also a greek . 
  marin barleti , a historian who lived at the time of kastriotis ( skanderbeg ) , composed kastriotis ' biography , calling him `` prince of the epirotes '' . 
  the epirotes were - and still are - greeks living in the region of epirus since ancient times . 
  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/historia_de_vita_et_gestis_scanderbegi_epirotarum_%28color%29.jpg this is a page from marin barleti 's book . 
  it reads : `` historia de vita et gestis scanderbegi epirotarum principis '' which is latin for `` history of the life and deeds of skanderbeg , prince of the epirotes '' . 
  this very page was also featured on an albanian post stamp from 1968 . 
  a greek man . 
  true . 
  yes . 
  that mustache was also quite popular . 
  and so was the swastika . 
  i had n't clicked the link . 
  wow , that is an interesting coincidence . 
  oh , so you know what i spend and what i earn now ? 
  how exactly did we bring this on ourselves ? 
  it is ridiculously low . 
  do you really find it impossible that people are pessimistic about the e.u. ? 
  to me it makes perfect sense . 
  i ca n't really pick just one . 
  there are many , in each era . 
  from ancient times , leonidas , themistocles , philip , alexander the great and many more . 
  from more recent times , all the people who fought for the independence of greece , like theodoros kolokotronis , athanasios diakos , georgios karaiskakis , odysseas androutsos , markos botsaris , mando mavrogenous , laskarina bouboulina and many others are national heroes . 
  pavlos melas who fought in the macedonian struggle is also a national hero . 
  all these people , among many others , fought - and some of them died - for greece and are honoured today for their actions . 
  because the governments are in on this . 
  it 's from 97 c.e. 
  it 's 1920 years old , not 20 !, 
  this belongs to a museum !,

   if they are in any sort of danger they should be protected who ? 
   and the regional constituent cultures should be protected . 
  what regional constituent cultures ? 
   we should have much more open borders no , thanks . 
   and should guard citizenship based on culture rather than class or accidents of birth . 
  can you elaborate , please ? 
  what accidents of birth are you referring to ? 
   europe should try to take in millions of poor blacks in the western hemisphere would you be ok with africa taking in millions whites ? 
  also , most of europe is in the eastern hemisphere . 
   the sole purpose of nations and nationalism should be to protect endangered languages and ethnic groups what about the non-endangered ones ? 
  should we just fade away ? 
   they were n't really guided by religion outside of the conquest of arabia . 
  well , the quran is full of verses of conquest . 
   the umayyads ( the largest of the muslim empires ) was actually founded and ruled by people who fought against the early muslims and only converted when they thought they had something to benefit . 
  it 's important to distinguish between the rulers and the people . 
  sure , the rulers probably did n't believe at all . 
  but the people believed in a book that told them to conquer .
