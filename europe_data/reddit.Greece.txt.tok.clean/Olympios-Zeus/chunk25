  now , about [ this map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/greater_macedonia.png/260px-greater_macedonia.png ) . 
  why should we accept it as the best definition of `` macedonia '' ? 
  it is mostly based on the roman province , which was defined , obviously , in roman times , that means , times when neither slavs , nor bulgars ( the two basic groups that formed the bulgarian people , part of whom are the people that live in the southernmost former yugoslav republic ) had moved in the region . 
  but as time goes by , geopolitical entities change . 
  borders are redefined . 
  as foreigners settled in the north parts of the region , the borders of the region were redefined . 
  think of germany , for example . 
  germany used to extend a bit to the east . 
  parts of today 's poland used to be parts of germany . 
  yet the people who live there today are , for the most part , poles . 
  should they have a right to call themselves germans because the borders of germany used to extend to those parts ? 
  that 's what happened in macedonia , too . 
  macedonia 's borders used to extend more to the north , sure . 
  but as macedonians ended up living predominantly south of the border , it only makes sense to define macedonia like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/location_map_of_macedonia_%28greece%29.svg/694px-location_map_of_macedonia_%28greece%29.svg.png ) . 
  the map that includes the country to the north is kept only because of the dispute . 
   the people who live there should be called macedonians for clarity turks live in ionia today . 
  does it make sense to call them ionians ? 
  would n't it be wrong , since ionians were/are greeks ? 
  it 's the same with macedonians . 
  we macedonians still exist , and we are greeks . 
  just because some foreign people live in a land that used to be part of macedonia at some point in history , does n't mean they are macedonians . 
   there is a pretty famous country that is made up of a number of united states , and is in america . 
  so it 's often colloquially known as america for geographic reasons . 
  americans were not named after a historic people , neither did they steal anyone 's culture or claim to be something they 're not . 
   i gather that greeks wish the republic to formally adopt some sort of geographic or ethnic qualifier , like `` slavic '' or `` northern '' macedonia not at all . 
  that would be terrible . 
  why would we want to share our history and identity ? 
  the only acceptable name would be one that does not imply any relation to macedonians , or other greeks . 
  unless it 's something along the lines of `` republic that is not macedonia '' or `` republic bordering macedonia '' or even `` fake macedonia '' . 
  `` north - south - east - west , lower - upper , slavic etc. 
  + macedonia '' are all wrong in this context . 
   but i 've never heard any ideas about greece similarly renaming their region why would we ? 
  our region was called macedonia since thousands of years ago , when the tribes that would later form the people of the f.y.r. 
  were nowhere near the balkans - or each other . 
  we wo n't change our history to fit their political agendas . 
   both the greeks and slavs have to realise they both have some claim to the name , but neither has absolute claim and no agreement will be based on that assumption . 
  why ? 
  share a name ? 
  well , there are cities in america called `` macedonia '' . 
  i 'm totally ok with that , except that it may cause some confusion if taken out of context . 
  but yeah , if anything , that 's honouring . 
  but sharing a name with a place on the other side of the planet , which is clearly named after you and does n't claim otherwise , is one thing . 
  sharing a name with a country that borders you and claims to be `` real macedonians '' and stealing your history and identity is another . 
  our macedonian heritage is not to be shared with anyone . 
   let macedonia be macedonia . 
  the people who live there are macedonians of course we are . 
  he said that about alexander 's father , actually , but do n't forget that demosthenes lived in a time were macedonia was rising in power and it would inevitably take the hegemony of greece . 
  demosthenes was an orator . 
  his job was to say big and fancy things to influece the people . 
  he wanted people to oppose macedonia , so that athens have the hegemony . 
   seeing how alexander was n't greek either new account ... troll maybe ? 
  the [ vergina sun ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/vergina_sun_wipo.svg ) , a symbol of the region of [ macedonia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/location_map_of_macedonia_%28greece%29.svg/694px-location_map_of_macedonia_%28greece%29.svg.png ) , is seen on various buildings here in macedonia , along with the national flag of greece . 
  it is also used by individuals often . 
  the symbol is popular in the rest of greece , too . 
  haha :d well , not really . 
  the idea is to give greek names . 
  maria is not a greek name , although it is traditional . 
  nobody in the parliament represents the country , let alone the district . 
  jacob rothschild . 
  there have always been changes in temprature . 
  ice melts and forms again every year . 
  it 's a seasonal thing , like the leaves that fall in the autumn . 
  sure , at some points in history the climate gets warmer , or colder , but as / u/jimba22 said , the last ice age ended by it self . 
  that means the climate got a lot warmer without human intervention . 
  also , climate change was called ` global warming ' or ` the greenhouse effect ' at first . 
  then winters got colder , so they renamed it to ` climate chage ' . 
  there had been predictions in the past that many cities will be gone due to climate change . 
  the deadline for those predictions has passed long ago and the cities are fine . 
  i do n't think humans are responsible for it . 
  i do n't know exactly , but it will be greek names . 
  i would really appreciate your effort and i would n't be offended , but if i was n't able to understand you , i would let you know i also speak english . 
  various greek movies from the 60s and the 70s . 
  they are shown on t.v. 
  very often . 
  part of the land were your country is currently located was part of [ ancient macedonia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/expansion_of_macedon_%28english%29.svg ) , yes . 
  mostly dependent territories . 
  the modern definition of the region of macedonia , the one that includes my region , your country , and parts of bulgaria and albania , is roughly based on the roman province of macedonia . 
  keep in mind that your people were not in the balkans at the time . 
  empires are gone , new people have shown up in the region and the macedonians ( we ) are now mostly within the greek region of macedonia , while lands that were formerly part of macedonia are now administrated by foreign countries , so the most fitting definition for the region of macedonia today would be [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/location_map_of_macedonia_%28greece%29.svg/694px-location_map_of_macedonia_%28greece%29.svg.png ) . 
  all other definitions are historic . 
  definitions of geographical/political entities change through time . 
  germany used to have a different definition 100 years ago than it has now . 
  the same applies for macedonia . 
  so why is the `` modern '' definition of the region still used ? 
  simply because of the dispute . 
  yes . 
  see my awnser to experience_sandbox . 
  also , what seems so weird to you about celts being greeks in a world were slavs can pass for macedonians ? 
  i do n't think they were thracians . 
  what i know is that they had greek names and participated in the olympics , which were greek only . 
  one of their kings , dropion , sent a bronze bull head as a gift to delphi , one of the most important greek oracles . 
  this would be an odd move if he was n't a greek . 
  paeonia would n't , since they are n't related to the paeonians , who were greeks . 
  western bulgaria is , to me , very accurate . 
  they are essensially bulgarians . 
  but there is a region . 
  and the region used to be a state of its own at some point in history . 
  its legacy remains . 
  sure , there is no sovereign country called `` catalonia '' today , but there used to be , and now it still exits , just not with sovereignty . 
  now , imagine what would happen if the entire country of france decided to name itself `` catalonia '' and claim catalonian history as its own .
