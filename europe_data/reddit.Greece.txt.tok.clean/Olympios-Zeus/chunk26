  would there be no reactions ? 
  i 'll make a new reddit account . 
  i 'll call it redcollowrath . 
  it 's already taken !, 
  why ca n't a person chose his own name ? 
  yes , there is a controversy with the country to the north . 
  but we had the name for thousands of years . 
  they only stole recently . 
  there was a city in thessaly , before the trojan war , called `` hellas '' . 
  now , in greek ( and norwegian ) , `` hellas '' is the name of the entire country of greece . 
  so , you shower before you wake up ? 
  some say it 's geographically in asia , others say europe . 
  to be honest , it does n't really matter . 
  culturally , it 's in europe . 
  i second that !, 
  but haters will say it 's geographically in asia . 
  well , if it was serious . 
  if he 's still teaching , he should stop . 
  the headmaster of the school ? 
  in the 90s ? 
  were you living in greece or abroad ? 
  i was born in the second half of the 90s and i was never hit by my parents . 
  my parents were also not hit by their parents . 
  yeah , i wanted to say that  but he asked for battles we won . 
  the battle was so glorious that people forget we did n't win it . 
  the persians actually won the battle , unfortunatelly , but they lost the war in the end . 
  i would say the [ battle of gravia inn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_gravia_inn ) ~ 120 greeks vs ~ 9000 ottomans . 
  we won . 
  the battle literally took place in a small building , where the ottomans could n't fit all their forces , so they entered in smaller groups and died . 
  when several hundreds of them died , they left . 
  it happened roughly 20 kilometres away from where the battle of thermopylae had happened , again in a small space , more than 2000 years ago . 
  very proud . 
  i 'm not sure . 
  i think it 's bbc international where you can select the language you want . 
  how bbcs do you have ? 
  great scott !, 
  i do n't watch the `` news '' in any channel , regardless of wether it 's based in greece or not . 
  but yes , i can watch it on tv if i want to . 
  some satellite channels , including bbc , are given by the internet provider . 
  thanks !, 
  too mainstream . 
  we shall colonize time instead . 
  possibly !, 
  i remember fimbulwinter from the `` age of mythology '' game !, 
  really interesting . 
  in the 6th century bce , cleisthenes of sicyon held a competition to decide who would marry his daughter , agariste . 
  as the contest was nearing its end , only two men , both athenians , had remained , hippocleides and megacles , and so far , cleisthenes favoured hippocleides more . 
  at one point , however , hippocleides got drunk and started dancing on his head . 
  cleisthenes was enraged and could no longer consider him his potential son-in-law , and so he told him : `` you have just danced yourself out of this marriage !, 
  '' , to which he responded : `` hippocleides does n't care '' , a phrase that would become famous for several centuries in greece . 
  and so , it was megacles who married agariste . 
  their marriage resulted in several descendants , including their son , cleisthenes , who is known as the father of athenian democracy , and their great grandsons , pericles , one of the most influential people of athens , who was one of the main figures behind the construction of the parthenon and most of the structures on the acropolis , and alcibiades , a prominent orator , general and statesman . 
  it 's interesting to think that all these men , whose actions largely defined the history of athens , would never had been born , thus changing the course of history , if hippocleides , who `` did n't care '' , was n't drunk that evening . 
  veganism is not very popular here yet , and vegetarianism is only a little more popular than veganism . 
  i 'm a vegan myself and i personally know several vegetarians . 
  and i do n't know them simply * because * they 're vegetarians , so i would n't say it 's super rare to meet one . 
  yeah . 
  oh , yes , i remember those !, 
  close enough !, 
   do you read greek ? 
  normally native words are preferred , but the following case is an exception . 
  the greek word for piano is '' \u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03bf\u03ba\u03cd\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf '' ( kleidokymvalo ) , but it sounds really weird when someone refers to it by this name . 
  most people use '' \u03c0\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf '' ( piano ) from italian . 
  the same happens here , but with a greek brand . 
  i do not trust their lies . 
  it 's not `` news '' . 
  it 's propaganda . 
  i do n't like the idea of an e.u. 
  army in the first place , let alone paying for one . 
  it 's easier to swim to greece from there than from any other arab country . 
  and even if i did n't make it , it would n't be so bad in lybia anyway since nato gave them democracy and freedom recently . ^ ^ / s, 
  look at them . 
  they 're the captains now . 
  there are labels for both scripts on the keyboard , like [ this ] ( http://www.keysourcechina.com/img/file/2014430235873499.jpg ) , if that 's what you mean . 
  i hope i awnsered you question !, 
  in greece , we switch between two keyboard layouts with `` right alt '' + `` shift '' . 
  one is greek , the other is a standard english qwerty keyboard . 
  well , the image i posted was not of my keyboard . 
  in my keyboard and most keyboards i 've seen , latin and greek letters have the same size , and the letters that are identical in both scripts are featured only once . 
  i just noticed that greek letters are in fact in ** bold ** font . 
  when you 're writing in one language you subconsciously ignore the letters of the other . 
  the only confusion for beginners is the letter `` p '' which means `` r '' in greek , but you get used to it with time . 
  well , you ca n't really see any refugees here , because the yugoslav wars ended more than 20 years ago . 
  are you ok , man ? 
  haha , yeah . 
  it 's weird . 
  anyway , best of luck in learning greek , or any other language you want . 
  `` right alt '' + `` shift '' is the lock . 
  this combination switches between layouts on windows and linux . 
  the layouts are independent from each other , so once i switch to latin , my keyboard is a normal qwerty keyboard that inputs latin characters . 
  if i want to type in greek , i press this combination again , and the layout switches to greek . 
  shift on its own does n't change layouts , it only enables caps/lower case and turns numbers to symbols , just like in latin . 
  you can have many layouts available , in which case `` right alt '' + `` shift '' cycles through these layouts and you might have to press it more than once to reach the one you want . 
  this has become the new definition of the word . 
  you 're right , amigo . 
  the word '' \u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 '' is normally masculine , but is sometimes used as a feminine noun when it refers to a special stone , like the philosopher 's stone for example . 
  honestly , this never occurred to me and i had to google it . 
  by `` your country '' i thought you meant greece , italy , france etc. 
  the e.u. 
  is not a country .
