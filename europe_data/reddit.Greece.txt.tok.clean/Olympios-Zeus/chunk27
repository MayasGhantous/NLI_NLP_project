  to save themselves from war , as they claim . 
  but they come from countries that are not at war . 
  they come to my country , yours , and most of europe in general . 
  haha , yes , many people confuse the `` y-u '' buttons . 
  i do too sometimes . 
  are you learning greek ? 
  we already have too many foreigners flooding the country . 
  i do n't see how hosting more would help anyone . 
  yes , that 's how it is on real keyboards , too !, 
  the [ greek keyboard layout ] ( http://www.dsi-keyboards.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ka-greek-20825.jpg ) is mostly the same as the english one . 
  greek letters that have a latin equivalent are positioned on the same spot as their latin counterpart . 
  '' \u0391\u03b1 '' is where `` aa '' is , '' \u0392\u03b2 '' is where `` bb '' is . 
  there are a few letters found only in greek and a few found only in latin , so in the place of , for example , `` j '' , which is not present in the greek alphabet , there is '' \u039e '' , which is not present in the latin alphabet . 
  it is taught in the first days of english lessons . 
  we use the greek alphabet , but we are very familiar with the latin one , too , because they are very similar . 
  in fact , they are basicly different versions of the same alphabet , since different cities in greece had a slightly different way of drawing some letters . 
  the etruscans adopted one of them , which they later adapted to their language and then gave to the latins/romans , while another version became more mainstream in greece as time passed . 
  all this happened when only capital letters were used . 
  lower case letters evolved separately are more distinct , but some still resemble their latin counterparts , as they were based on capitals that looked alike . 
  most pre-school children can understand the latin alphabet for the most part . 
  :d while the word `` hellen '' existed before helen of troy , it 's quite possible that the words are related . 
  there is a debate about this . 
  there is a dialect of greek , called tsakonian , or tsakonika , spoken in the peloponnese ( formerly also spoken in a village near the sea of marmara ) . 
  this dialect is the only surviving descendant of doric greek , the dialect spoken by the dorians , like the spartans . 
  every other dialect of modern greek is derived from attic , the dialect of athens . 
  unfortunately , it is only spoken by a couple of hundred people , most of whom are elders . 
  \u1f1d\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd or hellen in latin ( it 's a male name , as opposed to helen with one ` l' ) is the person who gave his name to the greeks ( \u1f1d\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 - hellenes in greek ) . 
  his sons , aeolus , dorus and xuthus were the founders of the tribes that made up the greek nation . 
  aeolus founded the aeolians , dorus the dorians and xuthus had two sons of his own , ion and achaeus , who founded the ionians and achaeans respectively . 
  [ this one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/coat_of_arms_of_greece.svg ) . 
  it is the greek cross , the same one that is featured on the national flag , surrounded by laurel leaves . 
  these symbols have been widely used since ancient , pre-christian times to this day . 
  in greece , almost every road sign that contains text is written in greek , with the greek script , followed by a transliteration to the latin script . 
  keep dreaming . 
  elgin marbles ? 
  since when are stolen things ( re ) named after their thief ? 
  we did n't sell them . 
  they were stolen . 
  celebrating the first of may , by collecting flowers and making a wreath with them can be traced back to ancient times and it 's still done today . 
  during the winter , children in ancient greece would go from door to door to sing carols , a practice that continues to the present day . 
  the lighting of the olympic fire at olympia every four years . 
  we wo n't sell our history out to anyone . 
  hello !, 
  to put it simply , it 's more than just a name . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , luxemburg was one region that was partitioned at some point in history , but the people living in the two parts are related . 
  with macedonia and the former yugoslav republic that claims the same name , it 's different . 
  they are different people who , due to close proximity to us , decided to plagiarise our history and identity . 
  note that they were not always in close proximity to us . 
  for example , imagine if i , a greek , who has no relation to germans , took a couple of million greeks and migrated north , and settled right next to brandenburg to create a country there , called brandenburg , or the republic of brandenburg . 
  would germany not react ? 
  now imagine if we proceeded to claim we are the real brandenburgers , descended from people who were there since ancient times and that the western part of our country is `` occupied '' by germany and should be liberated one day and `` reunited '' with us . 
  we would call our language `` brandenburgish '' , while it would obviously be greek . 
  we would claim historical figures and say that they were `` brandenburgers , not germans '' , and we 'd build statues of them . 
  these figures would have died long before our migration , but we would ignore this and many other facts . 
  we would also say that germany hates brandenburg . 
  even if we did n't pose a serious threat with our territorial claims , would germans not react to this cultural theft ? 
  we 're not a democracy . 
  the problem can not be solved unless it has been identified first . 
  most people still think we have a democracy and that we are ruled by good people who love us and who want the best for us and for this country . 
  it 's a fairy tale . 
  unless people realise this , the problem will not be solved . 
  decide who gets the position ? 
  you mean chose this foreigner over that foreigner ? 
  there is no choice in elections , only the illusion of choice . 
  there is a certain set of political parties that were placed there decades ago ( by non-greeks ) and they all belong to the same foreigners and people think that they actually have a say in who runs the country . 
  every member of the government and the so called `` opposition '' is not foreign . 
  some are native traitors . 
  and some are not greek . 
  but they all serve foreign interests and so , they are foreign . 
  i elected them ? 
  no , i think i would remember that ... 
  i never elected any of them . 
  well , in europe , i think the stereotype is the opposite . 
  that americans do n't know geography . 
  of course , many do , but several images pop up every now and then about how americans ca n't name most european countries on a map . 
  keep in mind that being able to locate countries on a world map or the map of a continent is one thing . 
  being able to locate subnational states/provinces in a foreign country is another , and non-americans ca n't be called ignorant for not knowing where south dakota is , just like americans ca n't be called ignorant for failing to locate the yunnan province in china . 
  that said , i can name a lot of u.s.a. states on a map . 
  and yes , they teach geography here , at least in greece . 
  no milk at all . 
  of course the government is a foreign power . 
  no , i do n't remember . 
  do we really ? 
  how can we have sovereignty when we do n't print our own money and when foreigners tell us what to do ? 
  in being a foreign power ruling over us . 
  i think the e.u. 
  is too much already . 
  we should leave . 
  thanks !, 
  wow , did n't know this . 
  i thought italians were pretty patriotic . 
  thanks . 
  is this because people are more proud of their city than the country as a whole ? 
  very . 
  it 's not divided officially , so it 's the whole island . 
  cyprus , because they are our brothers . 
  this deserves more upvotes . 
  in greek , the following female names are also used for other things . 
  '' \u03a3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 '' ( sophia ) means `` wisdom '' , '' \u0391\u03b3\u03ac\u03c0\u03b7 '' ( agapi ) means `` love '' , '' \u0395\u03bb\u03c0\u03af\u03b4\u03b1 '' ( elpida ) means `` hope '' , '' \u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae '' ( kyriaki ) means `` sunday '' , '' \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c5\u03ae '' ( paraskevi ) means `` friday '' , '' \u03a6\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03ae '' ( fotini ) means `` bright '' , '' \u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae '' ( anatoli ) means `` sunrise '' , '' \u039d\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 '' ( niki ) means `` victory '' , '' \u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac '' ( hara ) means `` happiness '' '' \u0395\u03c5\u03c4\u03c5\u03c7\u03af\u03b1 '' ( eftihia ) means `` joy '' , '' \u0395\u03b9\u03c1\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7 '' ( irini ) means `` peace '' '' \u0395\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 '' ( eleftheria ) means `` freedom '' and '' \u0391\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03ae '' ( areti ) means `` virtue '' . 
  there might be more .
