  an award ? 
  different department , same map . 
  nice . 
  i saw it , i mentioned it . 
  i knew that . 
  but i did n't imagine turkey would advertise it so much , given it violates international treaties . 
  i thought turkey cared about its international image , although on second though , it seems it does n't . 
  `` a greek commented on a turk 's post on reddit !, 
  quickly , brothers !, 
  let 's gather an army of internet turks and call him butthurt together !, 
  that will show him ! '', 
  are my feelings supposed to be hurt now that you called me butthurt ? 
  it 's a comment section . 
  i commented in it . 
  the army of butthurts came in later . 
  so , whoever made the map brought it in . 
  and whoever uploaded it . 
  a map was posted online . 
  below it , there is this thing called the comment section . 
  it 's used to , you know , comment on the content of the op , give your feedback on it etc. 
  guess what i did !, 
  i used the comment section to ... comment on the map !, 
  yes , that was the most commentable part of the map for me . 
  also , it seems you were triggered by my comment . 
  bringing cyprus into a weather report . . turks being turks . . 
  so they 're watching it , yet it does n't include the weather in that region ? 
  who ? 
  including northern cyprus in a map of turkey , what a disgrace ... 
  using the `` weather map '' trend as an excuse to propagate it on r/europe ... 
  so low of you ... 
  `` helped '' `` allies '' you made me laugh , good job !, 
  wow , i 'm really surprised only we , and to some degree , serbia , trust the internet more than the t.v. 
  * `` hungary you ca n't do this !, 
  you ca n't just protect your country like that !, 
  how dare you ?!, 
  yeah , i post on greek-related threads , a lot . 
  also ... are those eyes or breasts ? 
  well , yes , the script was different , but the language was a dialect of greek . 
  sumer was not in asia minor though . 
  there were greeks before the hitties . 
  maybe not in asia minor necessarily , but we existed . 
  haha . 
  am i famous ? 
  i did n't see your edit before . 
  well , homer was ancient , and the events he wrote about were even more ancient . 
  but there were older times than that , too . 
  what 's your definition of `` ancient enough '' ? 
  the greek \u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03cc\u03c3\u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf comes from ' \u03c0\u03cc\u03b4\u03b9 ' ( foot ) + ' \u03c3\u03c6\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03b1 ' ( ball ) , so it literally translates to `` football '' , which means we 're on the right side of history here , even though it looks different . 
  and not romans and other people of italy ? 
  i see , thanks for the explanation . 
  i was not familiar with the concept . 
   why is greece not one of the four ancient civilisations ? 
  ( china , egypt , india , asia minor ) what are the four ancient civilisations ? 
  also , asia minor was greek in ancient times and parts of it were greek until less than 100 years ago , before the genocides . 
  veles seems to be in that slavic country north of greece , not in macedonia . 
  who ? 
  well , he said that most people do n't know much about that county . 
  he just proved that he did n't know anything either . 
  and here , we see a wild car drinking water in its natural habitat . 
  as a macedonian , i do n't really care about hillary clinton and i do n't see how we had anything to do with her loss . 
  how is this racist ? 
  maybe because sorbian is only spoken there , while german is spoken in upper silesia as well as germany , and it only writes it once ( it does n't mark austria or german speaking switzerland , either ) . 
  i do n't know if upper silesia german is different though , so my theory might be wrong . 
  he has to eat just about anything . 
  he 's very hungary . 
  is this happening right now ? 
  i googled `` fire in rome '' and i got the ancient fire in rome . 
  then , on the news tab , it says there was a fire yesterday in an english college in rome . 
  i do n't know if it is related , or if this is from today . 
  maybe it 's common in cypriots and astronomers . 
  and cypriot astronomers . 
  on a serious note , i know it 's not exclusive to cyprus , since i have relatives with such names . 
  but in greece , when we hear this kind of name , we usually assume the person who has it is from cyprus , though it 's not always the case . 
  why ? 
  i posted [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwcksyhuntg ) in another soros-related thread , and it got downvoted . 
  let 's try again ... 
  yes !, 
  well , sure some of that land in the south used to be greek . 
  but our problem with them is the history theft . 
  and it 's common knowledge that they speak a bulgarian dialect . 
  haha , yeah . 
  the funny thing is that they would happily accept any of these if it came to that . 
  good point !, 
  sorry for all the questions !, 
  interesting . 
  or will it be his grandson that will take the name ? 
  or both ? 
  is it true that a lot of cypriots have similar names and surnames ? 
  like solomos solomou ? 
  i see . 
  thanks . 
  so , is the map wrong ? 
  is it patronymic ? 
  i just realised we are surrounded by red . 
  italy , albania , bulgaria , the other bulgaria , turkey , egypt and libya . 
  only cyprus is n't red . 
  i know a cypriot with no last name !, 
  a partonymic surname means that your surname is based on your father 's first name , like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/icelandic_patronyms.svg ) . 
  this happens in several cultures . 
  it happened in greece , too , at some point .
