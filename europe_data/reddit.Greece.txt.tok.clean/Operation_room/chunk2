  just search for zilan or dersim and you will know what i mean . 
  i do n't understand why praising european leaders who did something wrong is '' wrong '' but when we consider a megomaniac like ataturk who stole greek culture it is '' a hero who revived turks ! '', 
  most states in the world do things that are not legally possible . 
  think of usa 's nsa or britain 's intelligence . 
  in what way is it not possible ? 
  the software they use to declare passports unusable do n't have a '' only if citizen is not in britain '' button . 
  it 's pretty much possible . 
  the uk is n't somehow blocked by an invisible world ombudsman who will automatically stop them . 
  it 's just that the uk can be sued , which is another thing . 
  iirc this teacher was innocent but many '' teachers '' that operate are not just teachers like we know from the western world . 
  turkish teachers are appointed by the state ( who is now led by erdogan but before it also happened ) , and one of their ` tasks ' besides teaching is gaining knowledge on the people in that region . 
  they gather information of the children and when they get to know children or young students who are pro-kurdish rights , they play this information to the government . 
  in the past that led to an unspecified amount of kurdish civilians being abducted , kidnapped and killed by the turkish state . 
  keep in mind , it is not that long ago that kurds were called mountain turks and that the kurdish language was banned . 
  until this day , speaking kurdish in many parts of turkey will get you lynched ( not even by the police but by the people ) : ** '' turkish nationalists beat compatriot after presuming him to be kurdish '' ** : http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-nationalists-beat-compatriot-after-presuming-him-to-be-kurdish.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=88199&amp;newscatid=341 ** '' ankara police quash protests after mistaking spanish narcos theme for ` kurdish music '' ** http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/ankara-police-quash-protests-after-mistaking-spanish-narcos-theme-for-kurdish-music-.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=110089&amp;newscatid=341 these type of ` incidents ' are daily events in turkey . 
  imagine then that a teacher comes and gathers intelligence on you which they then send to the state and then you become one of those victims lynched , tortured or attacked because of your ethnicity/culture . 
  so , it is not without a complete goal that pkk have sometimes targeted teachers who happen to be ` useful idiots ' used by erdogan and other turkish leaders . 
  poland is actually the future of europe . 
  with or without the government 's policies . 
   you can not deny the exceptional amount of work both sides have made no , turkish cypriots ** want ** peace but turkey does n't . 
  there is a difference between the two . 
  it 's not for nothing that erdogan has been flooding akp islamists into cyprus . 
  turkish cypriots were never in favor of the turkish imperialism . 
   the usa is only marginally lower than turkey there are also a thousand times less americans than turks in germany . 
  if 1 % turk crime increased , it would far way more impact germany than american crime . 
  in addition , americans do n't create paralel communities like the turks in germany do where they literally curse germany . 
  russia has its own problems with turkey and actually lays claim to constantinopolis . 
  russians only accept alliance if turkey will be a junior partner . 
  knowing turkey 's racist , xenophobic and imperialist governments they will not bow down to russia 's demands and thus an alliance is not possible, 
  business insider : http://www.businessinsider.com/ahrar-al-sham-in-syria-and-turkey-2015-10?international=true&amp;r=us&amp;ir=t veruscript :  the first of these leaked phone conversations provides the basis for the allegations around turkish-sponsored support for an array of armed groups . 
  this leaked conversation was published following suspicions reported by various media claiming that trucks containing weapons and other military-related supplies were crossing the border into syria unchecked .22 given that this part of the transcript was released by rt some time after the conversation took place , it can be assumed that there was an element of political mischief . 
  turkey 's mainstream conservative newspaper , hurriyet , even acknowledged the matter with an article on the turkish opposition leader 's claim that the content of the transcript was no `` state secret . '' 23 indeed , upon its publication there was notable interest from other international media outlets from the new york times to reuters . 
  this led to increased speculation that the mit was behind the operation , given their historic links to the military and border security units .

  no , you contradict yourself and dont know anything about history . 
  you claim that cyprus was never greece 's yet claim that turkey existed for centuries . 
  i wasnt the one making that comment . 
  i just responded to the stupidity of your logic . 
  it 's actually very much in context . 
  because the arguments turks use , is in contradiction to their own policies when they deal with other people . 
  you live in a fairy tale if you think that the eu is going to allow erdogan and other turks to continually threaten and crush the eu . 
  that was decades ago , turkey 's support for isis , al qaeda , ahrar ash sham and other islamists hasnt end until this day . 
   do you really think war is the answer when all sides of the conflict are around the negotiating table and willing to do something ? 
  the turks are not serious in the negotiations . 
  they want cyprus to remain a satallite state of turkey . 
  in addition they refuse to deport the turkish settlers who dont belong on the island . 
  we saw what the weak russian sanctions did to turkey . 
  turks literally begged russia for its tourists . 
  just imagine what some european sanctions would do . 
   it is being allowed to occupy european union land because the greeks threatened to shut down any new members from joining the eu unless cyprus was admitted regardless of the status of northern cyprus . 
  the eu did not want to admit cyprus until the issue was solved , but the greeks forced their hand . 
  how does that in any way change what i said . 
  first you say '' turkey ruled these cities over centuries '' while turkey didnt exist 100 years ago and then you say greece never ruled cyprus meanwhile cyprus is greek majority . 
  lol you are just embarassing yourself . 
   as said , if kurds are so afraid , no one holds them hostage , they can leave anytime they want . 
  i have a hard time believing they 'd have a better time in greece where they ca n't feed their own people . 
  20 million people leaving to greece ? 
  why would the people born there leave so that turkish imperialists go inhabit those areas like they did with north cyprus ? 
  the current topic has a direct link with what i said . 
  turkey , the [ terror supporting country ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/ahrar-al-sham-in-syria-and-turkey-2015-10?international=true&amp;r=us&amp;ir=t ) has no moral ground to '' liberate '' people based on oppression yet oppress others of those same freedoms it claims to come for . 
  i 'm asking the question . 
  why does turkey feel the need to liberate turks in cyprus but treats its citizens with the same methods as the '' oppresers of turks in cyprus '' ? 
   the eu ca n't really do much . 
  the lionshare of turkeys trade is with eu countries . 
  turkey has a customs union with us that we can cancel . 
  contrary to russia 's gas depedence , the eu has no dependence on turkey whatsoever in terms of economy . 
  and if needed , eu countries can launch a military operation to once and forever end turkish imperialism in cyprus . 
   you can have them if you are concerned about them , deal ? 
  right , by the same treatment as the armenians , assyrians and greeks got ? 
   ** bedo gesaratsi , an armenian from turkey , views the issue from an interesting perspective . 
  he told al-monitor , `` calling one an armenian is killing two birds with one stone nowadays . 
  anyone opposing the state deserves the treatment armenians once received . 
  ** read more : http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/10/turkey-armenian-kurds-minorities-forced-to-be-turkish.html#ixzz4nnpmscdu, 
  it 's the greatest shame to the eu that even until today a terrorist-supporting country [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/ahrar-al-sham-in-syria-and-turkey-2015-10?international=true&amp;r=us&amp;ir=t ) accused of crimes against humanity targeting civilians from a 15-20 million kurdish population [ [ 2 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_rights_of_kurdish_people_in_turkey ) is being allowed to occupy ** european union land ** . 
  we will never be able to handle russia out of ukraine ( a non eu country ) if we even cant the defend our own territory against the turkish imperialists, 
  do n't forget about the 15-20 million kurdish people living in fear , oppression and racism . 
  why dont they deserve the same '' liberation '' as the turks in cyprus ? 
   yes . 
  after greek coup d'etat which aimed the annexation of the island to greece . 
  it 's funny because this is literally what the hypocritic turkish state does when talking about mosul and kirkuk , iraqi cities . 
  so why does turkey have a '' legitimate '' claim on cities with barely a 20 % turkish population but do greece have no legitimacy for a place with a greek name , majority greek population and greek history ? 
  i could also talk about turkey suppressing kurdish identity and culture or atleast claim that kurds should deserve no country ** yet ** invade other countries in order to '' safe turks from assimillation '' but you already recognized that turkey is wrong in occuppying cyprus . 
  no wonder , turkey has been plagued with a cult culture since its existence . 
  according to muslim leader erdogan yes lol, 
  the comment i referred to was about immigrant muslims , not about homegrown ones . 
   umm , here in nyc we have shitloads of hardworking muslim i didnt say that there were no hard working muslims . 
  i was referring to the immigrant muslims ( somalis etc ) . 
  hardworking muslims ? 
  muslims in us arent hardworking at all . 
  one of the largest growing muslim population in the us , the somalis , have huge unemployment rates and are generally on welfarehttp : / / www.wnd.com/2016/05/refugees-sending-suitcases-of-welfare-cash-home-to-somalia/: im not even talking about the terrorist attacks by muslims in the us . 
  mexicans are actually the hard-working ones . 
  they do the shittiest jobs for the lowest pays and dont complain . 
  several western media spread that lie . 
  he 's not blaming syrians in any way , he refers to the lie that leftists tell us about how all migrants are syrian and 1/3rd of them are doctors and rocket engineers . 
   this is why the opposition will never win another election if they continue the racism towards kurds . 
  kurdish population only growing to . 
  the dude mhp 's existence is on their xenopohbia towards other ethnicities . 
  only difference between akp and mhp is that mhp is more turkocentric and will sympathize less with arabs . 
  yes , people with weapons are only terrorist if they kill turks . 
  if they kill other ethnicities , it becomes '' an operation by the descendants of the gokturks to defend the motherland '' .
