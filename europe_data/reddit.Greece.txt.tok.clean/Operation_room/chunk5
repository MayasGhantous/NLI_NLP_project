  we are going to take your tourism, 
  what do you think the s400 is meant for ? 
  for eating cookies ? 
  it 's a mobile defense system . 
  when turkey invades others it doesnt want to be hit . 
  spread your '' turkey is a democracy and peaceful '' fairytale somewhere else . 
  we know from cyprus what you want to do . 
  lol . 
  your comment exactly shows why we should be worried about turkish invasion . 
  those '' claims having legitimacy '' is exactly what we worry about . 
   these greeks ( those who think turkey will ever invade greece ) are truly fucked in the head . 
  how misguided and delusional can you be that you think turkey has its eye on greece regardless all of our internal and other external problems because turkey has been peaceful ? 
  your country already kills own minorities and jails journalists . 
  just look at what turkey has been doing in the last 3 years from supporting isis to invading syria to threatening armenia . 
  but according to you , turkey is all peaceful and all the neigbors are the threat . 
  oh because you need a s400 for fighting the pkk ? 
  who are you kidding . 
  this is pure for invasion tactics against balkan countries . 
   ankara ( cnn ) `` tell us to kill , we will kill . 
  tell us to die , we will die .

  yes they want to .

   it 's funny when someone pretends to know about things he has no clue about . 
  why are you even at this subreddit ? 
  according to you only turks are knowledgable about turkey and the rest of us is blind . 
  we apparently are seeing something else than the democratic turkey where the voters are voting out erdogan . 
  apparently violence against white people is not terrorism but justification !, 
  im talking about his support for violent terror movements sucha s the black lives matter movement . 
  the movement which vows to kill all white people , and who have raped and kidnapped a mentally-ill white man from chicago . 
  so you are saying that turks didnt go on the streets beheading their own soldiers , hopping on tanks and fighting with armed special forces ? 
  there is even videos of helicopters shooting at people . 
  they were willing to die for erdogan , dont mess with me . 
  there were people beheading their own soldiers . 
  soros * is * by all means a terrorist if you look at the definition of it . 
  he uses money to influence politics via violence ways . 
  im not supporting the hungarian government but soros is not innocent . 
  it would be funny if only people of a country were allowd to speak on it . 
  keep kidding yourself . 
  in germany there were only 80k . 
   we ask the same question to people who vote for erdo\u011fan and they usually respond with `` because there are no better alternatives '' . 
  half of people who vote for erdo\u011fan actually dislike many things about erdo\u011fan absolutely false . 
  millions of people went to the streets to fight the turkish army for the sake of erdogan . 
  millions of people remained silent when he killed tortured and jailed kurdish polticians . 
  erdogan is the democratic voice of turkish society . 
  to hell with those so-called '' international agreements '' . 
  literally no country on the face of earth except european and american countries and india respect those agreements . 
  100 % of the other ones ignore them or interpret them as they wish to . 
  what is wrong with all this muh international agreement guilt ? 
  it 's not like an imaginary god will come and sanction us . 
  he is right though . 
  italy ( and my country greece too ) all talk like they are in a strong position while weakening themselves by allowing groups such as frontex to illegaly take migrants into our countries . 
  let 's ask the yazidis and assyrians who have reported of more than 50 genocides against them by muslims over the past 100 years . 
  but i guess somehow usa was still responsible for that , didnt htey ? 
   would you guys than be so kind and stop bombing the middleeast so this people dont lose their homes and have to run for their lives ? 
  would be a great help when you guys would just go home because isis came out of american bombs ? 
  stop support islamic terrorism with your leftist ignorance . 
  islam has a great tendency to breed extremism . 
  wo n't happen . 
  it 's not impossible , but highly highly unlikely . 
  the akp controls all the powers : executive , judicial and lesiglative . 
  and it 's not just erdogan controlling it , it is his whole party . 
  he is now ` training ' younger akp people to take over his role once he is done . 
  in fact , he is training his son-in-law who is an islamist-nationalist leader . 
  his name is berat albayrak and he is already the energy minister . 
  quickly , give them jobs !, 
  and jail the ones who are fighting isis !, 
  this is against the eu human rights . 
  the german government doesnt decide what hate speech is , the ** court ** does that . 
  this is against the eu human rights . 
  the german government doesnt decide what hate speech is , the ** court ** does that . 
  i do n't think that is a justification in any sense . 
  by point out she is a conservative , we make it seem it is normal to be conservative and anti-gay . 
  but that is not the case , and there are many conservatives who are pro-gay . 
  this is a very disappointing behavior coming from merkel . 
  especially after all her social justice rants against eastern europe when they refused to take in migrants . 
  disgusting how you try to justify it . 
  if it were ee country doing it you would call them nazis and '' authoritarian '' . 
  germany is being run by a conservative homophobe . 
  they do that to annoy turkey or force turkey to do something and then abondon kurds and armenians . 
  it 's a dirty tactic used by the colonialists against minorities . 
  i 'm glad that greece escaped turkish colonialism otherwise we would also be a tool in the hand of germans who would claim to help us one day and then abondon us the next day . 
  they are the majority . 
  akp + mhp has around 70 % of votes . 
  dont come here telling about what they did to kurds . 
  germans , french and especially spanish people are not interested in that . 
  they just want to hear that ataturk was secular just like the military and that minorities in turkey are actually well treated because at their holidays at the beach they dont see soldiers committing warcrimes, 
   which causes any german-pushed policy to be resisted internationally . 
  again not true . 
  germany is the instigator of many '' reforms '' in the eu . 
  just because their ideas have some ridiculous content sometimes ( merkel inviting all the muslims of africa and me into europe ) doesnt mean it has anything to do with '' prejudice against germany because of wwii '', 
   anyway , are you prepared for tolls ? 
  forgive me for my ignorance , but did n't open borders mean that we are n't fed with this kind of things ? 
  didnt even know there were still tolls . 
  what 's freedom of movement for if we still have to pay for tolls . 
  beautiful as hell !, 
  question for the spanish people out here . 
  how ` doable ' is it to travel through spain in the summer with a car ? 
  i want to go to spain this summer and rent a car there to travel through the country but i do not know enough about safety of your roads + the crowdedness in the summer . 
  this is a great mistake .
