  well , i think this is n't the case . 
  religion i think plays a big role in greece . 
  many people are religious , like if you ask them `` do you believe in god ? '', 
  they will say : `` yes yes ofc i am an orthodox christian '' . 
  if you ask them `` do you go to church ? '' . 
  they will say `` every now and then '' meaning only in easter , christmas , maybe their name-day and approximately like 5-15 times per year . 
  think 99 % of the people are baptized greek orthodox and most of them believe in god generally but they do n't think about it most of the time . 
  maybe for example before they are eating they will cross themselves , or maybe if their team in football has to score in a penalty shoot-out they will cross themselves again and say `` pls my christ help us win '' or some small things like that . 
  but what i wanted to say is that thing everyone mentions `` us is over religious '' personally i do n't see it . 
  maybe compared to sweden or other countries in europe like norway maybe yes . 
  but it 's not over religious . 
  most people in us have false idea about their country and false idea about europe . 
  they think that their country is racist and xenophobic and very religious compared to europe . 
  because when they think `` europe '' they think only 3-4 countries like germany , france , spain , england and italy . 
  they do n't think about romania or ukraine or some other countries . 
  because if they knew one thing or understand somethings about this countries in the balkans or in eastern europe generally they would n't say that things they say about their countries . 
  no i do n't think so . 
  in schools we have three months holiday and two weeks in easter and two weeks in christmas ( maybe a bit different but no much ) . 
  for work holidays i do n't know . 
  north greece , 
  its very important, 
  surely not, 
  other than greece for me it is easily italy . 
  left wing says : fascists , tagmatasfalites ( means greeks that were nazi collaborators ) , homophobic and maybe something else that i cant remember . 
  right wing says : unwashed anarchist ( meaning that they have long hair and beards and are generally dirty ) , bolshevik , katsaplias ( this is a word that i cant translate because i dont think there is an english word for that ) , faggot , and of course tourkosporos ( it means turkish seed ) and many others right now that dont come in my mind . 
  yes ofc, 
  no no no . 
  technically i think yes but we have 1 or 2, 
  havent seen one yet, 
  fuck - fyrom marry - serbia/italy kill - turkey, 
  i know man i live near salonica i dont like it very much but i think is better than athens, 
  well i am from pella so it is a bit obvious . 
  where to start . . this year will probably be the year with most tourists . 
  zante , corfu ( kavos ) , crete ( malia ) , ayia napa ( cyprus ) will be full of british tourists . 
  chalkidiki and katerini will be filled with people from greece and balkans . 
  athens , santorini , mykonos etc you can find whatever people and whatever festival you want . 
  personally i 'm gon na work again in beach bar and in my fields so it will be again hard summer but nevermind, 
  most beautiful probably is corfu or nafplio ?? 
  most ugly for me personally is athens . 
  obviously it has many good parts but if you speak generally i think it 's the worst of what we have . 
  no one and you are overreacting to the maximum . 
  sorry but you have no idea about apartheid or racism at all . 
  i guess yes . 
  i 'm orthodox even though i dont go too much to church i believe . 
  food yes it 's absolutely nice food . 
  fashion idk what you mean by that if you mean the traditional clothes that my ancestors wore in 1850 no but i wear what is common . 
  gestures yes absolutely . 
  this was one of my biggest culture shock when i went to germany, 
  yes i think that is correct . 
  maybe kapodistrias or venizelos could be more but that 's the ones coming to my mind for greeks after 1821, 
  not at all . 
  every channel makes propaganda based on who their owner is . 
  the most disgusting time was when the recent referendum happened . 
  depends where you are obviously is existent but mostly not in countries like germany or england or france . 
  balkans maybe if you are black or muslim you will be stared at . 
  no i dont have enough money, 
  nice wife, 
  fraud , liar and total shit like every other . 
  no because it has very big meaning and a lot of people have died and defended this flag, 
  corruption, 
  f e t a, 
  yeah i can hear them very clear i know exactly the hours when the hit them and i can understand from the way they are ringing if it 's happy ringing or sadness . 
  and it does n't bother me at all maybe sometimes i even like it ? 
  idk, 
  stevie g hands down . 
  thousands of reasons . 
  because `` uhhh oppression fasist turk '' the truth is terrorist attacks should never be accepted even if you are oppressed . 
  they would be more correct if they did n't blow up in the middle of the street and maybe i say maybe then turkey would grant them some rights . 
  but i think it 's too late for that . . 
  i have low expectations from all people because most of them butcher greek words so i am not annoyed . 
  some grandmothers wear it to show their grief i think for their lost husband , son or daughter etc. 
  trust me , uk is gon na be fine in the future . 
  very very common . 
  maybe i will sound like an asshole but they are literally too many to list them, 
  many people in europe ( especially balkan area ) have lived through islam supremacy for 400-500 years . 
  it is fear of the known . 
  and it is known very well . 
  monday = deftera ( \u0394\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1 ) - second day tuesday = triti ( \u03a4\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 ) - third day wednesday = tetarti ( \u03a4\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7 ) - fourth day thursday = pempti ( \u03a0\u03ad\u03bc\u03c0\u03c4\u03b7 ) - fifth day friday = paraskevi ( \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c5\u03ae ) - preparation saturday = savvato ( \u03a3\u03ac\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf ) - it means kind of rest day sunday = kiriaki ( \u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae ) - day of the lord . 
  lefta - money hrimata - money franga - money malli - it means hair para - money psila - it means little money, 
  q a t a r, 
  yeah i understand what you say but in reality is a bit different, 
  but you have to understand us is one country and europe is like 40 countries almost all of them with different values and different mentality and different languages !, 
  in europe in countries like finland estonia lithuania even germany sweden etc. 
  they do not like it . 
  in countries like italy greece etc. 
  they like it, 
  black islamists pirates, 
  it 's a weird story , many albanians became hellenized . 
  for example greece has 11 million population . 
  around 700.000 of them are albanians . 
  many of them feel greek or the ones that are born in greece slightly change their names to make them greek or obviously if they have greek citizenship serve in the army and stuff like that i ca n't even explain it properly . 
  besides albanians in greece , we have nothing else significant in terms of foreign . 
  i would say that they are the best from what we have . 
  but they are still a little bit biased . 
  very correct, 
  none of them in greece . 
  all are biased . 
  greece means zero diversity . 
  that we are lazy ( something we are not ) . 
  also that we are vocal and very outgoing .
