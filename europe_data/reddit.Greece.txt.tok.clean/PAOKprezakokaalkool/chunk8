  100 % pontic greek, 
  actually i have seen one or two times . 
  stop being against bashar assad . 
  if they stop doing it , then even if they do n't support assad with weapons , he can easily win the terrorists of course with the assistance of putin . 
  then refugees from syria will stop coming . 
  yes legal and every now and then you can hear some fireworks or shots from shotgun or some other things that i dont know the english word for it ( greek is krotida ) on weddings/baptisms etc. 
  and ofcourse in the games in football mainly and sometimes in basketball/volleyball/handball / polo they have this things . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvo9sl-cwyk this is for example in easter, 
  stresssssssssssssssssss, 
  again , it depends where you are from . 
  in france where black people are very common or western europe maybe people are not racist to blacks or whatever . 
  maybe if u go to eastern countries this changes . 
  about koine : speak ? 
  yes . 
  most of it i can . 
  it means the n word . 
  how we call nigger in greece ? 
  there is no other word for it . 
  we have the same in greece about moameth, 
  we have one that if i say it in english people will think i am racist but i heard it many times in greek . 
  `` if you wash the nigger , you harm your soap '' ( \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03c0\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b9 \u03b1\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03bb\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c3\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03b9 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c7\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2 ) it means that you do n't even have to try to fix/change someone that is like he is from his birth because you waste your time . 
  england or chechia, 
  greece, 
  in the village is common in the city is not common, 
  yeah man i understand but right now if you do n't have air condition it 's insufferable it 's 41c, 
  no kidding bro, 
  germany, 
  meteora, 
  it 's nice and it 's very promoted on the internet . 
  it 's romantic too . 
  26c and it 's good temperature for night . 
  there are more difficult nights where you literally ca n't sleep because of the heat . 
  do n't judge from what you see online, 
  yeah , i understand your thoughts . 
  good footballers, 
  sometimes i think that the diversity they have is cool but it 's causing them so much hate between the people and i prefer it the way we have it here . 
  i 've never been there but i 've met many rumanians . 
  genuinely good people . 
  would love to go someday, 
  pretty sure i do, 
  you dont know what suffering means then, 
  the only thing that is a problem that you can suffer from is health care and i doubt that people in the us `` suffer '' in that sense . 
  in what way do they suffer, 
  i think only if what you say provokes violence . 
  for example : `` kill all muslims '' . 
  that is hate speech . 
  dont even know her face, 
  it depends on person obviously . 
  maybe they are more romantic yes , but i dont think they are as open to sexuality like for example in scandinavia or generally northern countries . 
  g o l d e n d a w n, 
  you have created a false idea of europe in your mind . 
  i can assure you , us is a very good country for living and you have nothing to be jealous of most of europe . 
  do n't pretend you are having a hard life . 
  from accents i like cretan, 
  in my country we do n't have one, 
  where i can start with this . . man . . 
  yes 100 % for some reason people on reddit dont particularly likes americans and make fun of them but in real life is not like that, 
  generally i am not pessimistic but i dont think that they will get better sadly, 
  generally i think we are happy people , but we complain too much, 
  i dont think that we have such kind of citizens, 
  i understand what you are telling . 
  some things can not be bought with money . 
  but sometimes life here is very frustrating i can admit too . 
  depends where you live, 
  mainly in northern greece ( halkidiki , thasos , kavala etc. ), 
  come people from balkans , meaning : fyrom , bulgaria , serbia . 
  generally as i see in 2015 the top 10 was : 1 ) fyrom 2 ) germany 3 ) uk 4 ) bulgaria 5 ) france 6 ) italy 7 ) turkey 8 ) poland 9 ) us 10 ) serbia, 
  i think there is equality , yes . 
  anyone ( that you know ) can and i believe we are very welcoming as people and let people in the house and offer maybe coffee , drink or some sweet . 
  in school i dont remember when but i think i was around 8 . its easy though , cause its very small . 
  we learned 3 things by heart in school and that was one of them . 
  no and they never will, 
  they can understand each other fine . 
  little to no difference . 
  for ancient greek history : [ famous macedonia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_fvaolg-0s ) for ww2 : [ fool musolini ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bryigrhahkw ) [ duche puts on his uniform ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upwigvjhpio ) [ we took argyrokastro ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ur5nioobgs ) for greek independence war : [ 40 lads from livadia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgdxp67rlvi ) [ 12 evzones ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=002phunnvby ) and many more that do not come to my mind right now . 
  just beware of any gypsies . 
  that 's your only concern . 
  depends what turk you will see but i have n't has many interactions with them, 
  not much . . 
  no it is n't . 
  but generally in politics people have stopped supporting publicly any politician . 
  honest , no connection . 
  fire and earthquake but it was totally not serious learning, 
  not mixed at all . 
  from 1850 and after at least . 
  all my ancestors are greeks from pontus . 
  kill all terrorists . 
  honest opinion . 
  complaining about politicians then voting the same bastards again . . 
  when an american or a brit complains , a person from africa laughs . . 
  always, 
  most likely i would advise not to move here to anyone because most likely they would struggle, 
  hahaha even though he was very important for the win in euro 2004 people dont rate him at all in greece for some reason . 
  most people do n't even know him , but he is vasilis chatzipanagis, 
  generally i am a bit ignorant in this subject , but as far as i know people hold the royal family responsible for what happened in the wars vs turkey and how many greeks died . 
  but not the bavarian one i think . 
  the danish one . 
  again i say maybe i am wrong . 
  heard that it sounds similar to portuguese, 
  refugees ?
