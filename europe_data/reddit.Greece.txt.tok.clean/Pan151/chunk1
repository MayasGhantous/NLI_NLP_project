it 's a meme from a few years back ( why it became a meme in the first place , i do n't know ), 
  3 days respawn timer ... dammit riot ... / s, 
  without a shadow of a doubt , [ ion ] ( http://privenews.gr/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ion_3-630x418.jpg ) . 
  to be fair , that 's probably an old law . 
  and , again to be fair , though they may indeed be retards , i 'd rather they try to fix more important stuff first before they get around to fixing gender inequalities on the subject of boning minors . 
  edit . 
  it would appear they actually did actually change that law quite recently , so the age is now 15 across the board . 
  oh well , they did n't get us out of bankruptsy but at least they did that i guess ... 
  fyi the age of consent in greece is 17 if the adult involved is male - the default age of consent is 15 . 
  edit . 
  apparently they changed the law very recently so it 's now 15 across the board . 
  you call that a high unemployement rate ? 
  pff , amateurs ... 
  yeah , you are right . 
  i just mentally connected `` nod '' with `` downwards '' but not upwards . 
  ok , if we 're talking abou upward nodding , then you are indeed correct . 
  i just did n't associate the word `` nod '' with an upward movement of the head . 
  jaundice is a symptom of hepatitis ( sorry , as a medicine student i just had to nitpick that ), 
  holy crap that flag looks awful . 
  it 's like a scandinavian flag caught hepatitis ... 
  best : albania , uk worst : france , italy and every other boring tri-color flag ( except germany , they at least have some original colours ), 
  if all the previous arguements have n't clued you in , i 'm afraid i 'm not eloquent enough to help you . 
  read the rest of the thread , you 'll get it . 
  tl ; dr : historical reasons, 
  extremely west china, 
  well , fwiw we still call you helvetia ... 
  the problem is n't the name , it 's just that there needs to be a distinction between the greek and slavic macedonia . 
  we proposed the name northern macedonia . 
  they did n't want it , so we 're stuck with fyrom . 
  europe 's name comes from the original europa from greek mythology . 
  it 'd be nice if we had any ... 
  they 've mellowed down a little bit over the years ( those photos are quite old ) but yeah . 
  well , i can think of many better ways greece could utilise a couple trillion euros other than mining the hell out of our own seas - for instance ** not being bankrupt ** . 
  considering said pronounced leftist has been in a government coalition with a right-wing nationalist party for the past year or so ... no , not at all . 
  have you taken a look at any map recently ? 
  because unless you wan na mine ** the entire aegean sea ** then that ai n't gon na work . 
  ai n't nobody got time and money for that . 
  ignoring all ethical and/or geopolitical and/or other implications , of course . 
  i believe `` sick man '' is not the best way to describe greece . 
  `` comatose '' would , imo , be much more accurate . 
  you sound almost as bad as greece . 
  almost . 
  it 's always good to try and think for yourself ** why ** something is considered a taboo . 
  there 's nothing inherently wrong with any of the practices you described - sex in and of itself is never `` wrong '' . 
  what 's problematic are things ** usually associated ** with them . 
  the problem with incest is the high risk of birth defects if a child is concieved - otherwise it 's prefectly fine . 
  necrophilia 's problem is what the relatives of the decieced make it to be : i would not be able to give a damn what you do to my corpse - because i 'd be dead - but any living relatives of mine probably would . 
  and in pedophilia the real problem is the mental trauma if there is n't genuine consent ( which , let 's admit it , is like 90 % of the time ) . 
  and the physical trauma if the child is too young ( in which case pedophilia ** is ** inherently harmful ) of course , all that does n't mean we should just be ok with all those practices . 
  there 's a reason they became taboo in the first place . 
  just be critical about them , and do n't just blindly consider them wrong just cause . 
  also , even more minor correction , universe is pronounced as sym * b * an . 
  i like his style ( just not his hairstyle :p ) . 
  he is not afraid of saying a lot of uncomfortable truths ( like the fact that trying to depose all those dictators in africa and the middle east only made things worse for their respective countries ) . 
  he is also not afraid of saying some really dumb stuff , but i 'm comfident that , were he to actually become a president he would quickly be made to realise that and would act reasonably . 
  that 's what happened with our pm over here , at the very least . 
  also , he seems to like putin . 
  we greeks are one of the only 2 european countries that like putin . 
  so yay for that , i guess . 
  japan is love . 
  japan is life . 
  i know nothing about both ... aside from that they 're somewhere in europe . 
  turkey . 
  we 've been in a cold war with them non-stop ( we 've been in actual war a couple times too ) ever since we existed as an independent nation . 
  but hey , they at least gave us kebab , so they 've at least got that going for them !, 
  did you catch up on the obvious sarcasm ? 
  ( that was a rhetorical question . 
  of course you did n't ), 
  small correction : liechtenstein ( \u039b\u03b9\u03c7\u03c4\u03b5\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03b9\u03bd ) is pronounced exactly the same as in english - except with the intonation on the second to last syllable - and not `` lihtensten '' ( in which case it would have been written as '' \u039b\u03b9\u03c7\u03c4\u03b5\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03af\u03bd '' ), 
  chaotic neutral, 
  in greece you always keep your shoes on unless you are in your own house . 
  oh trust me , the planet does n't give a shit about what we do to it . 
  it will still be prerfectly fine after we 've exhausted all finite fuel sources on it . 
  we , on the other hand , with probably not be fine at all . 
   because in reality they 'll never be anything more . 
  except for all the times an aircraft got downed due to `` complications '' . 
  and all the times the pilots ended up acting a bit too hot-headed ( like that one time greek jets flew all the way to istanbul , did a low-altitude pass over the city for giggles and then escaped to russian airspace . 
  fun times . ), 
  in other news , the sea was especially wet yesterday evening . 
  more at 11:00 . 
  honestly , it 's only news-worthy if they are n't any dogfights over the aegean at any given day ... 
  hey there , someone 's got ta keep serbia company ... 
  about the same as they are in greece . 
  he looks like a guy straight out of texas more than a neo-nazi to me ... 
  we banned the communist party once . 
  a civil war and a military dictatorship later , we realised that was a bad idea and have since removed the ban . 
  well , to be fair , they kind of did n't elect ** anyone ** . 
   you feel closer to erdogan-led turkey ? 
  that 's a new one note the word `` culturally '' , as opposed to `` politically '' . 
  well , alexander never conquered italy , which is where the discussion started from , but fair enough . 
  if you 're offering all the land all the way to pakistan i guess we will graciously accept it :p, 
  maybe it 's just northwest luxembourg ... 
  oh god please do n't let the emmentaler extremists get involved in this ... 
  america does not lack a complete democracy . 
  what it lacks is an analog system democracy - just like most democratic nations do , to a smaller or greater extent . 
  europe is not a nation . 
  by definition there can never be a european nationalist party . 
  the word you 're probably looking for is `` federalist '' . 
  and sorry , but there 's no such thing as a `` common culture '' in europe - the countries comprising europe are far too diverse . 
  as a greek person , i feel much closer culturally to turkey and the greater anatolia region than to , say , nordic countries , and i 'm pretty sure the average swedish or norwegian person feels they have little in common with me as far as culture is concerned ...
