  why stop there ? 
  let 's also have constantinople and asia minor !, 
  let 's make byzantium grea ... oops , too soon ? 
  or just southern italy . 
  but we 'd prefer that you came to greece anyway , 
  just be thankful she did n't say `` england '' , like the rest of the world would have ... 
  why not ? 
  if there was no ban on shopping on sunday they would not be with their family , because they would be at work . 
  the problem is that even if it 's not profitable you have to do it , because otherwise you permanently lose customers to the competition . 
  and when you are a small 1-2 person shop and your competition a big business that can afford enough employees to be open 24/7 , it 's either lose your free time or lose your job . 
  speaking from experience here . 
  maybe there should have been . 
  but then again , who would you put in power in place of assad ? 
  another dictator ? 
  because you ca n't just say `` have free elections '' and expect everything to be all fine and dandy . 
  as has been demonstrated multiple times in both older and especially recent history , democracy can not just be forced - society must first evolve to embrace it , and society needs a lot of time to change . 
  as i said , `` child '' , in the legal meaning of the word , has a different definition depending on what you 're talking about . 
  and , as demonstrated in his very thread , in germany a 15 year old is considered an adult as far as having sex is concerned . 
  to further demonstrate that , let me list what age is considered `` old enough '' for various things in my country : having sex with an adult : 15 years old riding a motorbike : 16 years old driving a car : 18 years old being elected as a mp : 25 years old buying alcohol : 18 years old drinking alcohol : drink a whole bottle of vodka right after being born , the law does n't care as long as an adult buys it for you ( yes i do realise feeding your baby a bottle of vodka qualifies as child abuse so do n't do that ) that is as far as countries ' definitions of `` child '' are concerned . 
  as an individual you can have whatever definition you want - my grandpa used to call 40 year old women `` little girls '' ... 
  well , apparently germany ... 
  what is a good outcome is determined primarily by the alternatives . 
  currently , the only party besides assad with the capacity to rule syria without it instantly falling into chaos again is isis . 
  would you rather have them over assad ? 
  depending on what we 're talking about : many . 
  in the specific case of age of consent , about half of europe . 
  15 is the age where half of the boys already have beards . 
  no sane person would in good conscience call that a child ... 
  well , we 're still one of the only two european countries to have a positive opinion of putin 's russia ( and also one of the only 2 european countries where putin is ** the ** most liked major foreign leader ) . 
  so i 'd say we at the very least like them a lot more than we like anyone else . 
  ( btw try to guess what this other country is ), 
  cyprus is the obvious one . 
  also russia . 
  2nd option osaka . 
  well , animeland it is then :p, 
  but we were the first to properly remove kebab . 
  as a greek person : it applies to everything - english , french , russian , turkish - except for latin american soap operas for whatever reason ( and ofc kids ' shows and movies ) . 
  well , just to trigger people even more , atat\u00fcrk is listed under greece ... 
  why stop there ? 
  let 's [ make byzantium great again ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/justinian555ad.png ), 
  we 're talking scientific facts here :p, 
  * hey , hey !, 
  do you want to buy a. . . funnel cake ? 
  sc-out ? 
  they could always do a third referendum once article 50 is triggered , and a 4th one once they know the exact terms of the deal . 
  and then maybe a 5th one just to be sure ... 
  m in fyrom stands for macedonia , last time i checked ... 
  your mother was a murloc and you smell like a leper gnome ^ oops ^ sorry ^ wrong ^ subreddit, 
  ca n't do that mate . 
  stability loss at monarch death is a no-no . 
  now , theocracy on the other hand ... 
  we still have n't tried the nazis or the communists . 
  we could try one of those / s, 
  can we all please stop paying attention to him already ? 
  pretty please ? 
  not yet , anyway ... just you wait !, 
  greek wages up 23.47 % in the last two years ? 
  no , it has to be that brazilian guy , j\u00falio c\u00e9sar . 
  you see , you westerners do n't know how to eat meat . 
  you drown it in all sorts of sweet crap . 
  meat is supposed to be freaking savoury . 
  what does the proximity to asia minor have to do with foreigners in greece ? 
  most of them are albanians and bulgarians . 
  we 've been through this many times already : the slavic macedonians and the greek macedonians are completely unrelated . 
  alexander the great was definitely the biggest greek figure in history . 
  dude conquered everything all the way to modern day pakistan within a couple of decades , never having lost a single battle ... . . and then he suddenly died at the age of 33 . 
  bummer :(, 
  we are not at the bottom !, 
  yay us !, 
  did n't we already do one of these for greece a month or so ago ? 
  greece : slavic albania : slavic russia : not slavic ... what ? 
  ( also , bulgaria being simultaneously slavic and not slavic ), 
  blood of king leonidas !, 
  the `` h '' is silent ( an archaic intonation which we do n't use anymore in modern greek . 
  if it interests you , it 's for the same reason several words with a greek root ( homer , herodotus , homeopathy , hemoglobin etc ) begin with an h , even though the original greek root does not ) . 
  i included it in `` hellas '' only because that 's how it 's officially transliterated to english . 
  `` ellas '' would technically be more phonetically accurate . 
  same goes for helvetia as well . 
  france : \u0393\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03b1 ( gallia ) switzerland : \u0395\u03bb\u03b2\u03b5\u03c4\u03af\u03b1 ( helvetia ) belarus : \u039b\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03c9\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 ( leukorossia , literally `` white russia '' ) and of course greece : \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1 ( ellatha ) or more formally \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2 ( hellas ) rest are pretty similar to english . 
  their first thought for us is n't `` broke '' , like all of the other countries ' posts ? 
  what sorcery is this ? 
  do n't they still have a permanent claim on the region though ? 
  you might want to remove that comma . 
  unless you mean that people commuting to work is a necessary qualification for an area being called a `` region '' , in which case power on . 
   they point at a 9 % deficit and say `` eu would not let them in '' as if that would ever be a problem * wink wink *, 
  for clarification , when i say `` multiple meat cutlets skewered and roticeried in the the same fashion as a doner '' i 'm refering to [ this ] ( http://www.pindos-apsi.gr/img/product/image/gyros.jpg ) . 
  you then shave it , which naturally produces tiny pieces of caramelised meat , as opposed to [ doner ] ( http://www.gr.all.biz/img/gr/catalog/22906.jpeg ) which is a single meatloaf and naturaly produces long strips . 
  [ souvlaki ] ( http://www.oswtos.gr/img/souvlaki.png ) is not made of cutlets , but of small cubes of meat , and is not roticeried ( that would be [ kontosouvli ] ( http://www.funkycook.gr/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/%ce%9a%ce%bf%ce%bd%cf%84%ce%bf%cf%83%ce%bf%cf%8d%ce%b2%ce%bb%ce%b9-%ce%a0%ce%b1%cf%81%ce%b1%ce%b4%ce%bf%cf%83%ce%b9%ce%b1%ce%ba%cf%8c.jpg ) ) . 
  jokes aside , i just want to point out to everyone for future reference that , in greece , `` gyros '' , `` doner '' and especially `` kebab '' are different things . 
  doner is a big roticeried meatloaf , gyros is multiple meat cutlets skewered and roticeried in the the same fashion as a doner , and kebab is a small skewer wrapped in some form of spiced ground meat mixture . 
  it is every bit as democratic and secular as as you 'd expect any other theocratic/monastic autonomous state with its origins during the middle ages to be . 
  like the teutons , or the knights templar . 
  or , to use a more contemporary example , the vatican . 
  in fairness , i and \u03a1 are also greek letters ( \u03a1 is the equivalent of r , though ), 
  was n't macedonia slightly bigger though ? 
  ( not that it lasted for more than a few years , but still ), 
  you do n't need to be attracted to someone to have sex with them . 
  having sex with children makes you a child molester , not a pedophile , just like being attracted to children makes you a pedophile but not a child molester . 
  get your terminology right , everyone ... 
  arbitrarily placing all political ideologies into a 2-dimentional `` left '' and `` right '' axis makes no sense in the first place .
