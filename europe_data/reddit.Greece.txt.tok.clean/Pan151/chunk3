  one 's views of nationalism have little to do with their views on issues of general governance , or even with their views on other social issues . 
  yeah . 
  they 're not doing well in the tank meta . 
  looks more like serbia to me ... 
  i mean , it is ** hell ** as after all ... 
  it 's all about the local cuisine . 
  turks can not survive without easy access to a kebab shop ^ / s, 
   china is n't in europe they 're working on that . 
  give them a couple of decades , they should have bought out most of the balkans by then ... 
   when was the last time you saw some actual updates on the baltics , ukraine or turkey ? 
  this friday , actually . 
  yep , i definitely remember them . 
  hey there !, 
  we were doing the whole left-wing thing way before you you know ! ^ pls ^ send ^ monies ^ soon, 
  if who he is is so central to the story that it needs to be in the headline then you can use something related to the issue at hand , like * his name * , instead of his views on unrelated topics like homosexuality legislation , fiscal policy or fast-food take-out . 
  `` russian * pro-embargo * lawmaker caught shopping for embargoed fish in finland '' would be news . 
  `` russian anti-gay lawmaker caught shopping for embargoed fish in finland '' is two unrelated facts . 
  while anti-gay lawmaking is certainly objectionable ... what foodstuffs the lawmakers choose to import is completely irrelevant to it . 
  if you want to judge them , judge them about their lawmaking . 
  otherwise , we should also be judging child molesters based on whether or not they pirate game of thrones , and corrupt politicians on whether or not they like puppies ... 
  if you keep the hand there for a while , then yes it is torture . 
  but a split second is not anywhere near long enough to cause anything more than mild pain . 
  which i maintain is good for teaching a kid to stay away from hot surfaces , ** and for nothing else ** . 
  unfortunately , for simple creatures like young children , sometimes the only way to get a point across is through the - ** specific ** and ** limited ** - use of pain . 
  while i personally do n't have any experience with being spanked , i do have the experience of once having my hand grabbed and slammed on top of a red-hot stove surface ( only for a second or two , of course ) which did indeed achieve the desired goal of making me realise exactly why my grandma was telling me to stop playing inside the kitchen while she was cooking . 
  hmm ... one of these is not like the others ... 
  that 's more of a tournament about who can replace the most falafel with kebab , vodka or hamburger . 
  territorial rights are much like copyright - every now and then you just have to agressively defend it for risk of losing it , even if the `` threat '' to your copyright is a harmless youtube video - or , in the case of your territory , a country you could overrun in less than a week . 
  it 's a stupid world we live in , but it 's not like we can do much about it ... 
  well , let 's be realistic here - the argument `` they are a potential territorial threat '' is much easier to defend than just `` muh alexander the great '' , `` muh vergina star '' and `` muh hellinistic heritage '' . 
  greece may emphasise the first , but the real issue between the two countries is the second one - which , as you noted , is not something that 's easily resolved . 
  it 's mostly about cultural appropriation . 
  nobody seriously thinks of them as a threat ( yet ), 
  the title is claimed by multiple countries . 
  i think we should have a pan-balkan kebab removing tournament to once and for all settle the matter of who is # 1 kebab remover ( loser pays the bill at the shop for all the kebabs removed ), 
  romania # 1 kebab remover , now also # 1 vodka remover ? 
  if you are referring to greeks , we use `` chinese '' for the same expression . 
  `` french '' is a euphimism for swearing , as is the case in english . 
  it 's all greek to him ... 
  southern italy is rightful byzantine clay !, 
  time to go on vacation and libarate some oppressed griko minorities !, 
  those re-elections were for the position of prime minister , this is the first time he 's been elected as head of state . 
  well , at least they have enough spare military power to keep strengthening government ... 
  me too, 
  first of all i was talking about the two candidate elections , not the presidential election ( although in that case there 's still the accusations of the democratic party rigging their own elections in favor of clinton ) second , that nonensical presidential election system has been there for centuries - maybe `` the people '' should have made their voice heard about it somewhere in that time period if they disliked it so much , but alas it 's still there . 
  because those where the candidates that the people voted for . 
  how do you define the term `` democracy '' ? 
  or what ? 
  are they gon na invade german territorial waters too ? 
  the fish . 
  as in the only thing that 's to the west of portugal . 
  it was a joke . 
  apparently a bad one :(, 
  dude , you never know when the cods decide to launch an invasion from the west ... 
  [ actually , they still exist . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sovereign_military_order_of_malta ), 
  it 's about as much of a realistic fear as russia launching an invasion on the baltics . 
  which is to say it exists , but it is very , very , ** very ** unlikely . 
  mostly because , in the modern day , if there is n't a sufficient enough amount of people of the same nationality as the invader ( see crimea ) trying to control the invaded territory is just not wort hthe money and effort . 
  also , in both cases , there 's no incentive to do so in the first place , besides maybe strategic location ( which turkey does n't really need as they already have a similar strategic location as greece , and which russia ca n't particularly utilise because , even with the baltics their navy would still be largely useless ) . 
  well , in the theoretical case that 2 nato members go to war against each other ... what would nato choose to do exactly ? 
  well , actually , before the whole getting broke thing we spent proportionally ** more ** - around 3 % of our gdp . 
  you know you have a long way to go towards a common european army when the country that spends ( proportionally ) the most for defence is greece ... 
  not to say this is wrong , but you can find parallels between pretty much any two things if you really want to . 
  also , most muslim countries call us `` yunan '' ( ionian ) which at least is a cooler sounding name than the one we call ourselves . 
   probably because our sex education is n't very good , or not as good as it in similar countries . 
  well , the sex education in my country is not merely `` not very good '' , it is flat out non-existant , yet we are still confortably in the bottom half of the table . 
  i know that this is a grand sample size of 1 , and as such it 's not really indicative of anything , but there has to be some cultural or other reason for this . 
  awesome . 
  maybe one day they 'll also stop calling us `` greece '' . 
  one can hope ... 
  none of the rest of the ethnic groups are large enough on their own . 
  i mean , we could theoretically consider bosniaks and albanians as constituent peoples rather than large minorities , but then we 'd also have to do silly staff with other nations , like for example considering greece a multi-ethnic greek-albanian state ... 
  i mean , no matter whose you believe it 's supposed to be , it is de facto russian . 
  granted , i could n't tell you what 's the difference between the two , but there you go . 
  montenegro i 'll give to you , but romania is 89 % romanian . 
  when we 're talking about multi-ethnic states , we 're talking about states like belgium , which is split 60-40 % . 
  bulgaria is 85 % bulgarian . 
  i mean , over here theologists have managed to perfectly reconcile genesis with evolution and , if anything , we are taught about the theory of evolution in religious classes long before we are taught about it in biology . 
  so i 'm pretty certain one could do the same in islam with minimal effort . 
  [ you can have a read here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/population_exchange_between_greece_and_turkey ) long story short , after the balkan wars and the dissolution of the ottoman empire , there were a lot of greeks left in asia minor ( because that 's where they had lived for the last 2500 years ) and a lot of turks left in greece ( because they 'd been part of the same country for 400 + years ) . 
  of course , this being the balkans , this could not stand , because turkey is for the turks and greece for the greeks - so we forcibly loaded each other 's ethnic minorities in boats and sent them across the aegean . 
  not quite the same as the situation in bosnia , i know , but it might just end up in the same way one day . 
  greeks and turks also lived together for centuries prior to the dissolution of the ottoman empire . 
  yet we had to do a mutual deportation of greek turks to turkey and turkish greeks to greece in 1923 . 
  long live the holy ~ ~ roman ~ ~ balkan empire !, 
  we saw how creating a unitary , single , multinational state worked out with yugoslavia . 
  the truth is , this is the balkans . 
  multi-national states simply do n't work out around here , not to mention adding religious differences to the mix . 
  the far-right attack minorities . 
  the far-left attack ... whoever happens to be standing where they randomly threw their molotovs . 
  i do n't know what 's worse , targeted violence or blind violence . 
  revoke the privilegia intensifies . 
  anyone care to elaborate about malaysia 's olympics curse and what it has to do with greece ( the 2004 olympics i assume ) ? 
  that 's the joke .

  [ darude - sandstorm ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqw4w9wgxcq ), 
  as we would call them here in these parts , `` practically brand new '' . 
  pretty much , yeah . 
  that 's why the '' / s '' was there ...
