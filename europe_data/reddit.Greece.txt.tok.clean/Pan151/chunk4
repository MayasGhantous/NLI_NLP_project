  like all those polls in greece that were so off the mark in the past few years that all the polling companies had to publicly apologise ? 
   publicly apologise  * in greece * let that sink in . 
  i say we deport him to the philippines . 
  i hear they treat drug dealers really well there / s, 
  does that make the turks goblins ? 
  i would like to see the methodology for this data . 
  greece :  1 : cyprus yeah , obvious enough . 
   2 : italy as we say in greece , `` una faccia , una razza ''  3 : turkey we were the same country for 400 + years , so expected  4 : russia orthodox bros for life i guess . 
   5 : ireland ... the fuck is ireland doing ahead of iberian and balkan countries ? 
  on a sidenote , eesti definitely can not into nordic - only into finland . 
  uk will probably want that soon ... 
  definitely not nordic , because of finland and their vodka . 
  ** # ** houselivesmatter, 
  anarchists attacking ** anything and everything ** is definitely not unheard of ... 
  what , you mean you do n't remember that time when an atheist terrorist suicide-bombed the headquarters of the agnostic extremists ? 
  yeah , me neither . 
  we all want a great deal of things . 
  but `` wanting '' is not the same as `` actively trying '' . 
  also , you must be fun at parties . 
  did i say anything about it being unreasonable for eastern europe to think that way ? 
  no , it 's perfectly reasonable . 
  just pointing out that everyone else is fine with russia ... 
  if cyprus can get in so can serbia . 
  so the same thing that 's already happening between south europe and the rest of the eu regarding the immigration crisis ? 
  yes , i do have little optimism in regards to the future of the eu, 
  because it 's only the eastern european countries that look to russia as enemies . 
  speaking from the perspective of a greek person , we 've been historical allies with russia ever since our nation 's inception . 
  most of western europe was similar in the past 200 years . 
  nobody but eastern europe has a serious reason to start any beef with them . 
  he also mentioned in a q&a that he 's not counting the word `` the '' , for obvious reasons . 
  i think this data does n't quite do justice to the marvelous enginuity of greek road design . 
  case in point : [ this masterpiece ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyekowbshvk ) . 
  in my personal opinion , north macedonia is a perfect name . 
  i do n't think most people care about the word `` macedonia '' in and of itself , but rather want some sort of distinction between the 2 macedonias . 
  as for resolving this whole issue ... 
  i doubt it 's ever gon na happen . 
  be wary of the roaming fel reavers though ... 
  yeah . 
  gib back constantinople . 
  science finally proves that eesti can not into nordic ... 
   the uk ~ ~ at times ~ ~ is ridiculous, 
  exactly . 
  and they chose to support clinton instead of sanders , which in turn made sure trump won . 
  it was the jews all along !, 
  only 10 % ? 
  nope , the moustache is sacred . 
  we also had a driverless bus in greece a year or two ago , with quite a bit of success . 
  there are 2 main axis that judge what parties are : left-right and progressive-conservative . 
  i guess the polish government qualifies as conservative left . 
  what do you mean ? 
  left-wing former communists together with right wing ultra-conservative nationalists is the ** best ** combination !, 
  the indo-europeans are not ** indigenous ** to any place , because they do n't exist anymore . 
  however , there is a place they ** originated ** from . 
  also china , interestingly enough ( well , they try to - but like with most western names , they fail horribly ) . 
  hellas + helsinki = love ( for metal ), 
  hellas clearly can into nordic . 
  i find the lack of lada disturbing . 
  to the best of my understanding ( which is pretty much what little i was taught at school , so take this with a pile of salt ) it is the `` physical '' manifestation of god 's power upon the world . 
  sort of like the concept of the `` lifestream '' that you might find in many fantasy worlds . 
  though again , i am as far removed from a theologian as it gets , so that 's just my personal understanding . 
  tentacled bulls incoming . 
  once again , glorious hellas reigns supreme !, 
  ( since finland has no data on the op 's map i felt it appropriate to replace the usual netherlands vs finland meme with greece vs turkey ), 
  except for the fact that `` 2nd world '' is n't really a thing anymore , and has n't been for the past 25 or so years . 
  [ the figure for greece should be somewhere around 8.5 ] ( http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/system/files/publications/4526/td0616147enn.pdf ), 
  the dispute only has to do with names and history , not borders and trade . 
  well , in that case , [ \u03c7\u03af\u03b1\u03c1 \u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b3\u03ba\u03cc\u03bf\u03c5 ] ( http://www.athenstransport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/attikometro-page-0.jpg ) . 
  `` steer '' would be the better english translation , as `` moschos '' refers to the animal , not the meat . 
  though it could also just mean `` nice smelling '' ( `` moschato '' is often used as an adjective for wines btw ), 
  yeah , greek words are heavily inflected depending on number , gender and other grammatical/syntactical situations , which is not necesarily easy to translate to english . 
  also worth keeping in mind that etymology of proper nouns can be ambiguous . 
  for example , `` moshato '' , which the op has translated as `` something to do with beef '' ( though a better choice of words would be `` something to do with a steer '' ) can also be translated as `` nice smelling '' . 
  the greek names are right next to the english ones in the map . 
  although finding which corresponds to which in this mess is tricky . 
  while we do n't use the term `` bathing suit '' , in greek we refer to the activity of going for a swim at the sea as `` bath '' ( '' \u03bc\u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf '' ) , if that 's of any relevance . 
  they are called futanari , you uncultured baka !, 
  as a colourblind person , this is honestly the best colour scheme i 've seen in a while . 
  the darker the colour , the higher the percentage . 
  i 'm all for it , but money unfortunately do not grow on trees . 
  if you force employers to double their employees ' wages all you 'll accomplish is decreasing employment rates by 50 % .

  well , funny enough you would mention it , on the table of most harmful recreational drugs ethyl alcohol is actually near the top and cannabis near the bottom . 
  ~ ~ live ~ ~ roll your ~ ~ myth ~ ~ joint in greece !, 
   22 degrees or , as we like to call it here , 3 degrees below room temperature ... 
  you do realise that democracy does n't just magically happen , right ? 
  in order to transition from empire to republic someone first has to assume the emperor 's role and then gradually delegate powers to the people until the state can function by itself . 
  of course you could just wing it , but that does n't have the best of track records ... 
  look , if we fight over macedonia again then this time we 're keeping it , just so we do n't have to worry about that stupid name ever again . 
  belarussian drifting skills not quite good enough . 
  [ needs more eurobeat .

  regardless , without context it reads as `` horse river '' . 
  it 's actually horse river , funnily enough . 
  also greece and macedonia . 
  and every other nation i 'm sure . 
  you know how this goes - you go east , then you go even more east , and then you end up west . 
  - meanwhile , in eastern europe ... 
   it 's essentially a flappy bit of extra skin that brings little to the party goes to show how little experience you have on the matter ...
