  the more and more you are talking about it i think you are joking, 
  hold up . 
  isnt he joking ? 
  now you are just trolling, 
  the exceptions to the `` perfect competition = best '' rule, 
  so , you are about 100th in line for the crown ? 
  nice . 
  ikr , it doesnt even make sense for countries like ours ... a german guy that happened to be put there by his family in a country he doesnt even care about ... 
  well , not the ** whole ** soviet union . 
  the 1/15 ? 
  i was just making joke . 
  relax . 
   what will be the same ? 
  no turkey allowed on the cool countries club xoxoxoxo, 
  thank you for this . 
  thanks for pointing it out after realised it . 
  is this a copypasta i am unaware of ? 
  metal ? 
  like ... metallica ? 
  wow . 
  i feel like i understand it now from that new perspective ... thanks for making this comparison actually . 
  you might be suprised , but a whole goverment can be doing more than one things at a time . 
  also , certain personel is assigned ( and trained ) for its field . 
  i doubt the nuclear physicists that would be required to work on nuclears would be the ones doing econ work . 
  actually it turns out that we use a french word ( different one though ) which means `` small '' . 
  so we literally call them small-ings, 
  i meant that the assumption that they will do the same would be maybe predjudiced, 
  absolutely !, 
  we are already using a lot of our gdp for military and have military conscription so also investing in `` modern '' warfare would make sense . 
  though acquiring them would be a nightmare for everyone because of the ( arguably fair ) objections of the turkish . 
   we can impose environmental and safety standards pretty much globally . 
  i dont like being racist here , but america , on an international level , usually rejects these environmental restrictions . 
  `` could/would/should of '' we could go on for ages, 
  also , `` literally '', 
  i just couldnt let you live a lie :'(, 
  it is a bit more complicated than that , but you got the basic points, 
  the greek subreddit is the absolute monarchy of his majesty / u/gschizas the great ^ * heil !, 
  * so it is covered :p also the mod with the most work in this sub . 
  rofl @ fuckign the `` lazy greek '' stereotype up the ass . 
  talking * :p, 
  huh . 
  i always thought it was turkish ( they use them too ) edit : holy shit you are probably right . 
  the greek word semedaki derives from the french chemen which means small + aki which is a word suffix that usually is used to small things, 
   i expect nationalism in greece would surround the greek ethnicity to a large extent specifically the greek one also centers around history a lot , especially ancient times . 
  ( you would see movies about things happened 2.5 k years ago for example ) and i imagine it is the same as the us at canada . 
  we should ask a turk . 
  i think the prefix of the greek word is turkish, 
  semedaki ( plural : semedakia ) / \u03c3\u03b5\u03bc\u03b5\u03b4\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9 ( \u03b1 ) random image i found while googling the name [ `` well done mom !, 
  '' ] ( https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gctxto3hinvbabrpne-_8y92spthvtuhxcsu6ytnpk5uucgepqwy ), 
  there are plenty in greece and my grandmother still makes them and has one over her tv, 
  just imagine me being a kid knowing a few english and listening about a man called `` skatman '', 
  that 's not even funny dude . 
  people ( the usual uneducated conservatives that are like sheep to the populist politician ) believe that stuff . 
  thanks for the explanation, 
  we cant wait for traditional religious happenings to gather with the family ( about 15-20 ) people , eat and discuss ( basically yelling to each other stuf , in a good way ) the shit out of ourselves . 
  most recent example : this year 's easter . 
  stereotype specifically for creta ( big island ( for greek standards ) in the south of greece ) : i know how much a fake kalashnikov from pakistan would cost and almost to whom to talk to find it : / . 
  also , guns . 
  guns everywhere . 
   with an average temperature of around 27 degrees so , winter ? 
  lol @espania also , you have these terrible things over your screens too ? 
  turkey ( and the arabs ) left us cool stuf , but they should take that back to the pit of doom they extracted it from, 
  we blame our problems to gypsies ? 
  yes but it is identified and thought of ( by them ) so diferently . 
  fun fact : scat = \u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4 = \u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03cc ( plural : \u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac ) = ( literrally ) shit . 
  that 's how i get to know stuff without googling them . 
  sometimes it is so beneficial haha, 
  he is pm for less than a year . 
  germany wasnt centralist ? 
  i think it was at least authoritative . 
  being an empire up until 1917 and the first time democracy was tried ( interwar ) it didnt catch-up , imo because of the german authoritative tradition ( imo the crisis only made the whole process of extremism way way faster and abrupt ) . 
  if my views are ignorant ( they very well might be ) , please correct me . 
  i dont want to believe wrong stuff :p, 
  i meant stereotyped in the decades before they became refugees ( 1890s-1910s , maybe before that ) . 
  in ancient greece each city stereotyped other cities as untermensch , and all together other ethnicities as barbarians ( literrally using that word as a name . / probably the foreign languages sound like var-var ( that 's how you read barbarian in greek ) / and thus it remained as an adjective lol ) . 
  oh shit that goes way back . 
  thanks for sharing the knowledge , 
  good stuff . 
  can you tell me , when do you think this started ? 
  from carolignians ? 
  or maybe some tradition deriving from roman empire ? 
  i have been thinking it and i think it was a lite ethnic cleansing . 
  basically a genocide without the killings so you can sleep easily at night . 
  i mean , it does achieve what a genocide achieves : making the land yours from now on . 
  which brings me to the thought on why the cypriot problem wont get resolved : you cant just kill or displace all teh people in the occupied part . 
  this land is theirs now . 
  moral learning : if you commit a genocide , it wont matter that you did wrong . 
  is that a napoleon quote ? 
  or maybe louis xiv ? 
  erdogan is the president . 
  this guy is davutoglou, 
  i always thought that davutoglou was the good cop in the badcop-goodcop between him and erdogan, 
  the greeks from minor asia were stereotyped in greece as being smart and progressive . 
  an example : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aristotle_onassis, 
  pretty shitty man :( wan na see something really fucked up ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/population_exchange_between_greece_and_turkey how were these things even agreed on ?? 
  you mean the world cup . 
  alrighty then , 
  our 2nd to the goverment party has openly claimed that we are being sprayed systematically . 
  ( specifically the current minister of national defense ),
