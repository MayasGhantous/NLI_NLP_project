  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_crete also , the irony :d :  because of the heavy casualties suffered by the paratroopers , adolf hitler forbade further large-scale airborne operations . 
  however , the allies were impressed by the potential of paratroopers and started to build their own airborne formations . 
  what region ? 
  `` hellenic '' and `` greek '' is the same word ... it 's like saying `` hrvatski '' and `` croatian '',

  uk would vote for cameron to leave the house, 
  sure , the people want a democracy where everyone is free and equal , right ? 
  griechenland : griechisch singular : \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03ce\u03c2 \u03ae\u03c1\u03b8\u03b5\u03c2 plural or singular with formality ( kinda like the german `` sie '' ) : \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03ce\u03c2 \u03ae\u03c1\u03b8\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5, 
  you maybe already know this but just to be sure : we are talking 24 degrees celsius ( i assumed you are american because you said florida ), 
  we get more than 24 these days !, 
  wtf, 
  talk about pr :p, 
  greeks and turks that have internet access are the most progressive ones and i guess we are cool with each other . 
  now , i know some friends that are the stereotypical : `` argh . . turks , fuck that '' and they ** would ** have ... problems ... in first hand interaction with turks . 
  oh well , at least it is better than , say , 30 years ago ... 
  yes but i trick yuo brixelle !, 
  i am not trapped in here with yuo , you is trap in with i !, 
  xaxa grece yuo of genious, 
  how do you even tell if someone is a jew ?? 
  nice food for `` thought '' to the `` white supremacists '', 
  shouldnt it be area size adjusted instead of population adjustment ? 
  good old ball-of-many-polans joke . 
  people please dont make this a hatethread, 
  good old hooligan gear , 
  hooray for someone not putting the money factor to decide if eu is good or not . 
  whom are you including then ? 
  ah that is a very inteligent and nice pun , 
  50 reason greeks are loved by us, 
  haha in the greek part is doesnt mention the `` expensive '', 
  yes i happen to know econ101 . 
  i just asked if the index is adjusted to that . 
  me too o.o, 
  nice name , 
  is it always more open = better ? 
  genuine question, 
   how some greeks see germany maybe more like how media sell it . 
  and they try very hard . 
  and the equivalent german media make it sooooo easy, 
  or you know , they accepted it cause they can accept cold hard true facts . 
  unlike a lot of us, 
  the cross is there because the revolution ( which created the modern state ) was in the name of christianity ( and the people werent defined by the ethnicity , but by religion under ottoman rule ) . 
  the nine stripes are the number of syllabes when you say the revolution motto : freedom or death ( \u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03ae \u03b8\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 , \u03b5-\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd-\u03b8\u03b5-\u03c1\u03af-\u03b1-\u03ae-\u03b8\u03ac-\u03bd\u03b1-\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 = 9 ) . 
  blue because sea and white i guess it 's pretty generic, 
  you mean bloodline mix ? 
  my point was that just because they would have issues , it doesnt justify causing issues . 
  now we cant know it for sure now can we ? 
  i wonder why . 
   misleading peoples and parliaments by presenting a bank bailout as an act of ` solidarity to greece ' ** would turn germans against greeks , greeks against germans and , eventually , europe against itself . 
  ** the whole shittines summed up so well, 
  `` our goal as far as turkey is concerned is to help them on their way to european path '' - venizelos 1923 . since you say you know about history ( obviously paraphased ), 
  turns out money does bring happiness . 
  who knew ? 
  i just mean that the message is cool and all , but it is waaaaaaaaay more complicated than that . 
  also , most liberty vs security arguments get lost in the definitions despite the two sides really believing the same ( common sense ) stuff . 
  well , in 100 years from now middle east wont be a perfect society , but they will be killed less ( i hope ), 
  ahh ... balkans . 
  the middle east of 100 years ago . 
  churchill celebrate giving up part of czechia ? 
  that was done to avoid war wasnt it ?
