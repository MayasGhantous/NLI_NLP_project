  a thanks is more than enough for you . 
  europeans dont send money to greece . 
  they pay the interest payment to the loans . 
  if you take the interesto of the loans out ( primary deficit/surplus ) , greek govt budget is balanced . 
  so that money goes to lenders , german and french banks . 
  it is just to not allow a default , which helps greece too , but it is not out of altruism , or actually going to greece . 
  did anyone win ? 
  we have them , but not on the coastlines . 
  they are on the mountains and other underdevelopped areas ( also they are a minority thank fuck ), 
  wait . 
  you actually are ? 
  uefa , like fifa , only care about $ $ $ , so that 's a no-no . 
   they are sticking for us now and they did it when uk choose to leave , and did not throw us under the bus that 's cause it 's not `` them '' sticking up for `` you '' . 
  all together stick for all . 
  romanians are part of the decision making . 
  interesting, 
  you mean that in 900ad europe was more developed that china ? 
  idk man , the indians and the chinese were pretty advances . 
  so was the nile delta and mesopotamia, 
  its as if i dont think they brigade every thread . 
  or its as if they dont all do the same thing . 
  dont think about those two things simultaneously , you might hurt your brain . 
  braindead lmao, 
  you just assumed they leave their safe space, 
  it 's a joke based on the fact that corsica became french after napoleon was born, 
  there was an economist article on it . 
  google `` the economist brexit bill '', 
  just let me shitpost okay, 
  yeah i imagine the family christmas tables . . bourbon : honhonhon je have le france . 
  igm had a poll about that . 
  http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/brexit-2 i think this isnt that uncertain . 
  max daily ? 
  if i get 12 in my house i will die, 
  isnt this like the french system ? 
  all i see is eesti stronk, 
  ache from love . 
  it 's a very romantic thing, 
  sevdah is bosnian ? 
  i thought it was turkish . 
  btw we use this word in crete ( although only on heavy crete dialects ), 
  but it wasnt paid because that money was deffered liabilities to usa, 
  this tax was retroactive though, 
  thanks, 
  can they pass it before the referendum ? 
  and even then cant the president just not approve this pardonne ? 
  didnt the president anounce a referendum on it ?

  yeah we have a winner i think, 
  more like fight with itself . 
  as is tradition, 
  you think that you are on to something ? 
  thank fuck this sub 's mods finally started going ham, 
  there 's no stealing in art, 
  bettering our lives one obvious thing at a time . 
  when listing crazy religious herds do n't forget greece . 
  yet juan carlos was popular even amongst republicans in spain ( at least the ones i saw here on reddit ), 
  not to mention that we have had enough of experts, 
  i mean , that 's mostly why germans are the most popular in europe, 
  have scientists concluded that intelligence and consciousness are a physical process in the brain ? 
  idk , but i think they would agree that there is no replicating that . 
  you are the one thinking magic robots with conscience are gon na conquer the world, 
  cause humans are inherently inteligent in a way that machines ca n't replace ? 
  i disagree . 
  humans ca n't be obsolent, 
  i said that any unemployment will be short term . 
  if its massive or not i dont argue . 
  and ubi doesnt solve unemployment is what i argue . 
  which brings me to my point , ubi proponents use unemployment scares to push for the ubi which is not even a solution . 
  in the meantime lets try to alter the entire world preemptively !!, 
  i dont think there is a difference . 
  the two things you describe seem the same to me . 
  each task that was automated was a job that died . 
  its the same thing . 
  jobs become obsolete . 
  even if we all become robot makers its still fine . 
  i think there needs to be a distinction between the problem and the solutions . 
  there is one thing expecting mass unemploulyment , and another thing proposing a ubi . 
  the one the experts get behind . 
  and correct me if i am wrong , but there is no concensus among scientists that technological advancement bring permanent unemployment . 
  so let 's assume the thing that makes us the most scared over the thing that makes the most sense, 
  i dont think there is anything point towards there other than fear mongering, 
  but there is nothing other than panic that points to something different . 
  and also ubi supporters that want ubi even if it is unrelated to the problem . 
  seriously the whole `` massive unemployment is imminent '' is just hivemind thinking . 
  before we start panicking , allow me to note that technological change has never led to massive amounts of unemployment . 
  this is n't to say that some displacement does n't happen , but it is a ) short term depending on how flexible the labour market is , and b ) absolutely worth it . 
  overall , this displacement is the only problem . 
  now that we have established this , we can look to solutions . 
  considering that it is a short term problem , what governments should do , is help make this short term as short as possible ( retraining , vocational counseling , etc ) . 
  a ubi solves different things and it is not the solution to high unemployment . 
  it might be ( i am not arguing ubi in this comment ) a solution to low wages , but that 's not a problem that arised with technological change . 
  here 's an interesting article i had saved http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/6717/economics/the-luddite-fallacy/****, 
  we ca n't be sure now can we, 
  seems more like panicking to me, 
  nothing to do with sparta ( though some spartans correlate it ) . 
  it 's a low development area . 
  same with the `` some cities around here i think '' area . 
  its a stereotype/half truth that south/most of peloponese is far right . 
  you could find supporters of monarchy in there . 
  come and you wont see guns .
