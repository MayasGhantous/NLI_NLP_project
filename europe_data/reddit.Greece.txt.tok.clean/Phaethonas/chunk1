  no , but trump is . 
  just two words ; fox news !, 
  actually , now , it is you , who have fallen victim to finnish propaganda and `` rewriting '' . 
   finnish concessions and territorial losses exceeded those demanded by the soviets pre-war . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war#peace_of_moscow ps carry on , do n't mind me, 
  as if this is the only ' `` rewriting '' in the history of history ( pun intended ) . 
  as a matter of fact this is not even the worse . 
  actually boredom makes you do things that you would n't think you would do otherwise, 
  not only that , but i think that if you do n't vaccinate your kid in italy , you lose custody !, 
  i support measures like that as well . 
  if you do n't vaccinate your kid , you neglect it and you put it in harm 's way . 
  as a matter of fact , you do n't need a new law , as long as in a state if you neglect , abuse and put your kid in harm 's way leads to losing its custody . 
  what ? 
  the guy is an italian . 
  you can see the italian flag on his left arm . 
  as such , he is part of esa . 
  in esa 's symbol on his chest we see all members states of esa . 
  did poland recently become a member of esa ? 
  is this poland 's `` huge success ? '', 
  is this a joke ? 
  is this a reference i am not getting ? 
  lol , that is hilariously funny , cause i vividly remember that the us bombed a convoy of kosovar refugees by mistake !, 
  yeah , they saved your asses !, 
  also , who should had intervened to save serbians from you ? 
  uck is notorious for committing crimes against the serbians . 
  after the war the international community tried to find mass graves of kosovars , instead they found mass graves of serbians killed by the uck . 
  once more , a terrible conflict with crimes from both sides , but once again , only the serbians took the blame !, 
  lol i never defended war crimes . 
  you have a very huge problem of reading comprehension , or at the very least your english suck . 
  in literally every comment i have stated that the srebrenica massacre was a crime , that serbians did other crimes as well , and that croatians and bosnians did their share of crimes as well . 
  as a matter of fact anti-serbians , bosnians etc tried to justify bosnian and croatian crimes by saying that the serbians did more !!, 
  so , if anything i never denied war crimes coming from either side , while bosnians have done so !, 
  lastly , yes , i suppose you may say that i deny that the srebrenica massacre was a genocide , because it was n't . 
  was it a crime ? 
  yes !, 
  should the offenders be punished ? 
  yes !, 
  was it a genocide ? 
  was it part of ethnic cleansing ? 
  yes !, 
  specifics matter . 
  why would the op , the bosnians in general , you or any other , wish to dub a heinous war crime genocide ? 
  why would anyone wish to exaggerate ? 
  let me answer that . 
  because you want to demonize the serbians . 
  because you want to say that `` the serbians did worse '' . 
  as something like that matters , when we are talking about the worst conflict ever since ww2 , in which all sides showed the worst face of humanity . 
  you want the cycle of hatred to be open . 
  you want the cycle of hatred to be open , in order to say in the future ; `` the serbians did worse , they are not humans , let 's kill them '' . 
  literally there are bosnians here that have said that serbians are not humans . 
  you know what this means ? 
  this means that if serbians are not humans , you are justified to do to them , things that you would not be justified to do to humans . 
  you de-humanize your enemy . 
  with lies , and exaggeration . 
  and while serbian leadership has been found guilty of ethic cleansing , key word ; ethnic cleansing . 
  for the srebrenica massacre , not even the international court of justice accuses serbia as a whole . 
  yet , you do !, 
  because , as i said earlier , you want to de-humanize the serbians . 
  which suffered in the wars like you . 
  they suffered from you . 
  not that this justify their crimes . 
  but neither their crimes , justify bosnian crimes . 
  surprisingly neither did the serbian leadership !!, 
  read the comment below for more info . 
  actually i do not even know what this `` remove kebab '' meme/video or whatever , is , and as a matter of fact , i did n't even had the curiosity to google it . 
  and still i do n't have the curiosity to google it . 
  as such , i do not know , neither i want to know what this expression , meme , video or otherwise is about . 
  apparently , you are projecting your own shit on me . 
  i return them to you , they are all yours . 
  actually do you have any proof that the serbian leadership was behind those criminal activities , that you accuse them of ? 
  cause i just read that not even the international court of justice accuses the serbian leadership of those war crimes ( regardless of how they are called ) . 
  specifically `` it cleared serbia of direct involvement in genocide during the bosnian war , [ 8 ] but ruled that belgrade did breach international law by failing to prevent the 1995 srebrenica genocide , and for failing to try or transfer the persons accused of genocide to the icty , in order to comply with its obligations under articles i and vi of the genocide convention , in particular in respect of general ratko mladi\u0107 . 
  [ 9 ] [ 10 ] '' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genocide_convention#yugoslavia in other words , the international court of justice does not accuse the serbian leadership for the srebrenica massacre ( which is called genocide ) , but accuses ratko mladi\u0107 . 
  also it ( the court ) accuses the city of belgrade for failing to protect the bosnians and for not giving ratko mladi\u0107 to international authorities . 
  oh the things you learn the more you dig up . 
  and the more things you learn , the less demonized the serbians are !, 
  and yet , this very thread 's mission is to demonize the serbs !, 
  oh please keep them coming , the more you try to demonize the serbs , the more i learn about these events and the less the serbs are demonized , and my main point ( that this op tries to demonize the serbs by exaggeration ) is proven even more . 
  lastly , all those said , ** it is my personal opinion ** ( and thus ca n't be proven ) , that ** all war crimes ** committed by generals and other high ranking officials of an army , regardless of the conflict and the time period ( as such applicable to all parties during the breakup of yugoslavia and even beyond the events of the breakup of yugoslavia ) , are known to a degree , to both the political and military leadership . 
  there may be direct involvement of those leaderships or not , they may have ordered or silently agreed , but there is knowledge of the events and an involvement , ** unless ** , there are concrete reports that the military and/or political leadership at least tried to stop those who committed those crimes . 
  case in point . 
  although the international court of justice cleared serbia from any wrongdoing during the srebrenica massacre and blamed ratko mladi\u0107 for it , and the city of belgrade for failing to protect the civilians and for turning over ratko mladi\u0107 , it is my personal opinion that the serbian leadership at the very least knew and turned a blind eye . 
  but did so , on the crimes that the facts support , and those crimes do not include genocide . 
  similarly , when a croatian and a bosnian military leader did his crimes , it is my personal opinion that the croatian and bosnian leadership respectively , knew and at the very least turned a blind eye . 
  actually i read a part of the convention ( the part that is found at wikipedia ) and nowhere does it state anything about mass rape of women . 
  also , although there have been reports of women raped during their relocation , i am not aware if these rapes were extended ( and to what degree ) , neither there is proof that these rapes were organized as the killing of the men were . 
  lastly , regardless of any legality , common sense is applied . 
  in all cases of genocide men , women and children were killed . 
  entire villages were burned and whipped out , with absolutely no survivors . 
  when the perpetrator takes measures to kill only the men of military age and does not kill women and children , you can tell that this is not a genocide . 
  also , of note is the following . 
  in the part of the convention that i read and describes what a genocide is , you can see that the relocation of the children may constitute a genocide . 
  key phrase , relocation of the children , not relocation of the children and women . 
  if you think about it , there is a reason for that . 
  if you transfer children from their ethnic group to another , then they will lose their ethnic identity . 
  if you transfer the children ** with ** their mothers , then the children is highly unlikely to lose their ethnic identity as their mothers will make sure that this wo n't happen . 
  as such , if the serbians wanted to perform genocide by relocation all they had to do was to relocate the women and children in different places . 
  they did the exact opposite , as such , they did not try to alter the ethnic identity of the children !, 
  that is a very strange action for someone who wants to accomplish genocide , do n't you think ?
