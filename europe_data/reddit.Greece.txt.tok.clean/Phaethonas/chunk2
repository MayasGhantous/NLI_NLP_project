  although i read nothing of raping women in that part of the convention , raping women could also constitute genocide in my opinion , if the rapes are organized in such a way that their purpose is to change the ethnic composition . 
  for example , serbs raping bosnian women , with the purpose of children being born that are part serbs . 
  that did not happen . 
  the raping of the women reported at srebrenica does not fit that profile , instead fits the general profile of soldiers raping women in order to break their enemy 's morale . 
  so , my question is this . 
  when the serbians at srebrenica have done such heinous crimes what is your ( plural ) motivation to dub it a genocide ? 
  do n't answer that , the question is rhetorical and has been answered by me in a previous message . 
  in short , the bosnians want to demonize the serbians as much as possible , something that the op does too , when he/she compares the deaths of 8000 to the deaths of millions . 
  that , in turn , will keep the cycle of hatred , violence and vengeance alive . 
  i do n't care how you excuse yourselves for being not just nationalists , but ultra-nationalists aka zionists . 
  the facts are facts . 
  according to facts , nationalism , whether it was nazism , or serbian nationalism ( as we are talking about srebrenica 's massacre ) , or bosnian nationalism , or even greek nationalism , has committed atrocities and all these nationalist movements have tried to justify their crimes with bullshit . 
  that is applicable to zionists as well . 
  with the excuse `` the existence of our country '' , you try to justify the crimes of israel/zionism towards the palestinians , whose country you oppose to let be created !!, 
  that is exactly what the nazi party did , and that is how i shamelessly and proudly speak the truth and compare zionism to nazism . 
  nazism persecuted you , killed you by the hundreds of thousands , put you into ghettos , marked you as animals and justified it by saying `` for the sake of my country 's existence '' , and now you do the same , exactly the same !, 
  i feel awful writing these , i stopped typing for a second . 
  have n't you learned ? 
  have you learned the wrong lessons ? 
  did you learn to be who persecuted you ? 
  it is so sad . 
  you have become your persecutor !!, 
  you do n't need to persecute palestinians in order to live . 
  you do n't need to violate international law in order to exist . 
  lastly , i have n't seen `` anyone around me '' for which i feel ashamed , or i want to distance myself . 
  the palestinian to whom you answered , and now i am answering to you , did not say anything that could be interpreted hostile to the jewish people . 
  as a matter of fact , he said the truth . 
  you have made a business out of your drama , your own suffering . 
  had i been a victim or a survivor , i would be ashamed . 
  there are many other genocides . 
  the greek genocide and the armenian genocide conducted by the turks for example . 
  and i am mentioning them , because my grandparents were among those persecuted back then . 
  we have n't made a business out of them . 
  we remember , but we have n't made a business out of them . 
  how dare you , to treat your own people like that !, 
  you should be ashamed of yourselves . 
  and i am proud that i do n't stand alone , and that there are israelis and jewish people around the world , that share my views . 
  these israelis may not be popular enough , organized enough , or whatever , and they may not be in your parliament , but they exist . 
  i know that your have marginalized them , i know that you make their life difficult , i know that sometimes you even put them to jail , and for that , i think they are the bravest men and women of the world . 
  cause unlike people who suffer and fight for what is their right , and could be debated that were drove in a corner , these israelis could opt for the easy way , the safe way , and they did not . 
  kudos to them !, 
  i have answered about the international court in numerous comments in this thread . 
  on the other hand , i would very much like to explain to me why the fuck the serbs let women and children live , whom they relocated ? 
  that is not consistent with an organized effort to kill all muslims . 
  as a matter of fact , in 2004 serbians acknowledged the crime at srebrenica and produced evidence that the killings were organized and limited to the men because they wanted to deprive the muslims from men able to fight . 
  although this is a crime it is nowhere near a genocide . 
  as a matter of fact , had the serbs not relocated the women and children and had left them there it would not had been ethnic cleansing either . 
  although it would still be a crime . 
  facts matter . 
  and the facts are that 8000 died , ** all men ** and the women and children were relocated . 
  that makes it an ethnic cleansing . 
  `` bosnians who committed war crimes did so in breach of orders . 
  meanwhile serb leadership ordered war crimes '' we both know that this is not true ( as all leaderships ordered criminal activity ) , but who am i to make your sleeping habits worse . 
  and how is this an answer to the points i raised ? 
  i never said that they all committed the same amount of crimes . 
  what i said , and i will keep saying , is that a ) both committed crimes and b ) op 's motivation is quite clear . 
  he/she wants to demonize the serbs , which he succeeds when you can see people in this thread saying that the serbs are worst than animals . 
  furthermore , by saying that the serbs did more crimes you are not helping . 
  only when all parties acknowledge all their crimes we can have peace and move forward . 
  at that time , no-one should keep count and say ; `` hey the serbs killed 1000 more '' . 
  you know why ? 
  cause this can and will be used as justification for the bosnians to kill more . 
  and by the way , to my knowledge those who committed the worst crimes , the most cruel crimes , were the croatians . 
  not that it matter in my opinion . 
  ps i do n't think that the title is intended to imply hundreds of thousand , if not millions , ** it implies a similar figure of dead with the holocaust **, 
  well , why would someone compare the death of 8000 , without saying the number , to the death of millions if he/she is not a nationalist ? 
  why would someone say that there is a genocide , when there is n't . 
  granted the srebrenica massacre is part of the ethnic cleansing the serbs did , but ethnic cleansing and genocide , although related are different . 
  why would someone want to name the crime at srebrenica a genocide and compare it with the holocaust of all things , when there is no genocide to begin with ? 
  the answer is simple . 
  because they want to demonize the serbs and portray the bosnians as victims , while both parties committed atrocities in one of the worst conflicts of the 20th century . 
  that is something only a bosnian nationalist would do . 
  not to mention all the comments in here , written mostly by bosnians ( you can see their flag ) , who call serbs worst than animals and so on . 
  oh yeah , there are no bosnian nationalists in here !, 
  i am just imagining things . 
  but wait , i have screenshots , other people see them too !, 
  wtf !, 
  so , maybe , just maybe , this thread is full of bosnian nationalist scum, 
  you mean this is a thread which wants to demonize the serbs and promote the idea that bosnians are only victims . 
  something which will continue the cycle of hatred . 
  i ca n't support that . 
  especially since the op exaggerated and compared the millions of jews , roma people , homosexuals and others that died during the holocaust , with 8000 , without mentioning that the dead were 8000 . 
  why is this important ? 
  because people who do n't know about it , will assume that the serbs killed hundreds of thousands at least !, 
  hence , demonizing them , and projecting the bosnians just as victims , while the wars following the dissolution of yugoslavia were the most inhumane after ww2 , with ** all parties ** having committed atrocities . 
  i have n't deleted anything . 
  ever !, 
  but i have been on the internet long enough . 
  goodnight my friend , and thank you , for proving my point, 
  1 and 3 ) lol you just violated what you said previously about the fact that someone else 's crimes do n't undo yours . 
  you just tried to justify the bosnian and croatian crimes , just because the serbs were `` worse '' . 
  in a war that ** everyone ** showed the worst of humanity , `` the serbs were worse '' . 
  like it matters . 
  thank you !, 
  you finally have showed your true face to everyone . 
  now i can rest . 
  if someone else wants to see who you truly are , good for everyone . 
  if not ... this is as far as i could contribute . 
  2 ) i never said that everything else is good . 
  i said the exact opposite .
