you really do n't know what that means , do you ? 
  rastafarianism has/had a similar belief about king haile selassie i of ethiopia . 
  `` used to '' ? 
  according to the map poland and russia still do that . 
  bigotry . 
  no no , i do n't think that any one with a pro-russia opinion is getting paid , i 'm saying that this certain person is getting paid . 
  turkey 's and saudi arabia 's policies are certainly not 100 % aligned with anyone other than themselves . 
  you apparently do n't know much about the subject to find it weird that countries can have their own agendas . 
  your link claims in one place that these groups are backed by americans , then it claims that they are backed by turkey and saudi arabia . 
  so , what 's the pay like ? 
  who ? 
  i 'm gon na guess it was n't a problem when the west intervened in the clusterfuck that was bosnia and kosovo , right ? 
  he can be seen in the video drinking coffee while holding a lit cigarette . 
  he is the deputy minister of health though . 
  but he 's also a huge malakas . 
  it 's exactly the same situation before syriza won the first elections , why do you find it strange ? 
  the referendum happened mostly due to internal conservative party reasons , not due to ukip . 
   although a un tribunal has been blocked by russia . 
  what not to do if you want to appear innocent . 
  to be honest , most people did n't know what they voted for , since the question asked in the poll was convoluted . 
  i 'm sure if the need rises , the expenditure will do as well . 
  that 's not all nato members . 
  for example , greece , crisis and all , spent 4 billion in 2014 ( 7 billion in 2009 ) . 
  turkey too . 
  the issue is n't when ** you ** plan to go to war . 
  i think this dude is a downvote waiting to happen . 
  crushing your hopes and dreams . 
  i thought the units that participated in the ** '' ** coup ** '' ** belonged to the 1st army ? 
  the combination is ... 1 ... 2 ... 3 ... 4 ... 5 ... 
  i do n't think many people wanted a coup before it started , but a lot wished for its success once it was under way . 
  you still have to reach the missile to intercept it . 
  as i said , russia has silos that are well beyond the reach of any interceptor . 
  if nato started putting missiles in kazakhstan , then russia would have a problem . 
  you 're showing your ignorance now . 
  these missiles are for s and irbms , not icbms . 
  your reading comprehension is zero . 
  i did n't list iron dome as a ballistic missile interceptor , that 's exactly what i said it ca n't do . 
  i have read the damn thing . 
  again : icbms ca n't be intercepted . 
  period . 
  not the s-300-400-500 can intercept them , neither the iron dome/patriot/whatever . 
  missile shields and similar crap ca n't work , these missiles can only hit icbms when they are launched , and you need to react to their launch very fast , and russia is n't some small country that can be covered by sam missiles from outside their borders . 
  only way to intercept them is by using nukes , and only one system is allowed per superpower . 
  and russia has their one system protecting moscow , thus protecting them from decapitating strikes . 
  i do n't get what decapitation strike has to do with icbm inteception . 
  that is n't new . 
  also , all nuclear powers have strategies that include the loss of leadership . 
  icbms ca n't be intercepted in their re-entry stage , except for two systems that were allowed to be built by treaties , one for each superpower , and those still have to use nuclear missiles to intercept them . 
  then there are submarine launched ballistic missiles . 
  do n't worry , mutual destruction is still assured . 
  they were huge in greece too . 
  [ do it like the greeks . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_bailout_referendum,_2015 ) ( however you see it , you 're probably going to end up f 'd up the a. ), 
  you should feel bad for the the other 52 % too . 
  at least whatever happens wo n't be on the 48 % ers ' hands . 
  eh , for london . 
  yup . 
  i have a friend who always talks about the rothchilds and the rockefellers and the whosits and how they control the world with their money and their schemes . 
  first thing that pops into my mind is that maybe he believes those things because that 's the way his mind works too , and he would do the same things if he had their money . 
  lower taxes is n't left , it 's right . 
  seriously , this is the weakest defense someone can make for a person/party/etc . 
  this is certainly on merkel 's policies . 
  * idiot . 
  check the links header , it comes from the_donald . 
  that the `` system '' is fighting them . 
  that is what domestic terrorism is . 
  but we ** are ** good with cash . 
  better than the jews , but not as good as armenians .

  nazi germany with nukes . 
  how lovely . 
  which ( london 's economy ) is based a lot on freedom of movement . 
  they were n't all appalled by the genocide . 
  some germans sided with the turkish government on the matter . 
   i have n't met a serious stalinist in my lifetime consider yourself lucky . 
  yup , that 's a giraffe , alright . 
  everyone believed that back in the day . 
  medieval folklore/zoology is full of mythical animals like that . 
  river horse, 
  we were n't that good at it anyway . 
  at what ? 
  exactly !, 
  how we all be truly equal when there are different people around ? 
  so , the plan is to emulate them ? 
  well , he did n't win by majority . 
  1st , distance . 
  cyprus is right next to turkey , and very close to greece . 
  it 's not on another continent . 
  2nd , the majority of the population identifies as greek , and the rest as turkish , and both wanted , at least until a few years ago , integration to their respective countries . 
  3rd , greece and turkey ( and uk ) are guaranteeing cyprus ' independence , and all three have soldiers stationed in their parts of the island . 
   i understand that , but it 's seems a bit like portugal and spain suddenly arguing about uruguay just because 2 centuries ago they 're also disputing the territory and so there maybe some descendants there nowadays too ... 
  it 's not at all like that ... 
  it is voluntary , esa is n't part of the eu . 
  you 've made the same argument numerous times . 
  but how do you know ? 
  you never had a foreskin ? 
  oof , this is getting really stupid . 
  yes , i get it that you have to squeeze it with your hand . 
  in your idiotic argument , are you arguing that the skin of your hand is different than the skin of your penis ?
