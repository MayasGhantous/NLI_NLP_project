it was a chain of events that actually started with the treaty everything bad that happened to germany back then was solely because of the treaty, 
  well russia still had the means to be self sustained germany back then didnt especially when they took all of their coal mines and gave them to france . . so not only they had to pay for everything but they still had to buy ( and i assume to an unfair price ) from the french coal . . the point wasnt to explain or not what hitler did but that the sole reason of hitler 's rise is to be blamed to those who actually signed that treaty they were the ones that put him on power they were the ones that with their decisions forced the people to vote for him, 
  do we forget the events from ww1 to ww2 and what actually gave force to hitler to rise ? 
  do we forget who among other was the one behind the plan to fuck up germany during that time as a punishment that practicly gave rise to hitler ? 
  his decisions to solely blame germany for ww1 ( while in fact even britain back then had a massive share on that clusterfuck ) and made them pay for literally everything while in the process taking away their colonies and everything they could possibly have to begin any sort of production led to germany being bankrupt thus creating the perfect road for hitler . . 
  another piece of clickbait garbage from yours trully the independent, 
  34 died on ontake but i think that video was on a surviving member, 
  actually there was a warning in place they allow people to pass through certain paths but not that close, 
  there are risks and there are stupid risks the mountain for the past 2 weeks was exploding almost every day it wasnt dormant and suddenly decided to wake up like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3obsoj9q2do ) one whoever told them that it was safe to go up there needs to get his ass sued, 
  darwin is proud of that crew ... and what makes it even more funny is the bbc correspondent that went up there is an actual scientist ... 
  there is hurting and then there is this there is a very big difference, 
  you wouldnt have tought that bbc would steep down to this ? 
  spend a week on / r/worldnews its much much much more common than you think, 
  you really think the imia in 96 happened because they wanted an outside enemy ? 
  in the early 95 the greek army had revised some of their plans towards the creation of the ( join task force ) they succefully had created a force with a very small reaction time this was know to nato ( we are part of it ) but no one knew where the sf teams would have gone for their emergency holding neither the nav paths of the warships or how many planes we could have on the area . . now you say that this is all bs . . but in the mid 2016 the greek army started once more to revise the reaction time of the units ( based on the scores from the joint task exercises ) and they created 3 new teams the delta the omega and the alpha specifically to be a quick reaction force in the aegean . . now guess when turkey started to peak up their rhetoric ... 6 months later ... 6 months later in 95 we started to see the same bullshit ... 
  who didnt expected that the `` anti fake news '' site will push for their agendas ? 
  people dont realise that there isnt a single truth out there anymore . . its our truth vs theirs truth, 
  no not really thats the point of the video ... 
  he talks from the beggining of nasa till 2013 ... spend some time and listen to what neil has to say about what actually driven the politicians to create nasa in the first place, 
  check this out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joarxzagtum&amp; i think you gon na get a nice view on how nasa is actually funded, 
  nasa is part of the grid so no its not only in nasa hardware esa helped quite a lot on the data crunch, 
  nasa needs pr ? 
  because if ghosts are really our energy then i just assume that everything we are must be part of them also ( the logical concept i guess ), 
  there is quite a lot that we need to prove or even understand first about us as humans in order to then go and research if ghosts do exist or not the most profound of all is the consciousness how do we even have that . . why do we have it, 
  you know why i hate this kind of articles ? 
  they just conclude something without actually having any proof that they actually did something ... i mean if someone now say `` we cant predict earthquakes ( which is true ) and then he says we will never be able to predict earthquakes ( how the hell does he know what the future will be like ? ), 
  same goes for ghosts we dont know if they exist . . we dont know how they manage to manipulate energy in a way that its not detectable . . we literally dont know enough about physics to actually proved that they exist or not . . same goes for the dark energy lhc cant pick it up so with his mentality dark energy doesnt exist . . 
  no i actually know that no one in the world wakes up one day and says ** lets go and fuck up the world ** i mean look at poland at 2016 ... they were saying `` oh russia is going to invade us we need help '' `` oh russia is bad we need military help '' and well at the end of october the media picked up a story that they were trying to pass questionable laws under the desk to legalize some form of corruption on the goverment and that led up to the massive riots we saw . . and suddenly poland stopped talking about russia . . who would have thought of that ... / s people like you that just comes in labels people with no evidence what so ever they dont deserve to even taken seriously, 
  whatever you say meanwhile you still havent provided a single evidence for nothing, 
  you are still labeling me and even going as far as saying that im a paid putin shill despite the fact that i have given you evidence . . and yet here we are you talking big and providing zero evidence zero facts nothing you expect someone to take you seriously when you just eat every shit you heard on the media just because you are lazy to use osint to cross check all the fake news out there ? 
  lol please . . 
  still if they dumped so north the winds dont match up look at the pattern they said it was detected and then look up the winds . . ( basicly europe was pretty much under a high pressure with a very low system on med sea and it was snowing on the black sea and turkey so whatever happened it couldnt be so north on russia ) unless russia was dumping on south and on north at the same time this doesnt add up also they said it was detected as far as spain this has to be something else ( i just hope that its not in ukraine since both of them ( ukraine and russia ) have du ammo for their tanks . . ), 
  now there is a very simple way to actually see if it was russia or not http://www.eurometeo.com/english/city/archive_select the winds do not match unless the russians dumped the iodine right on the north pole ( something i think of is that one of their subs while on the baltic sea might have a problem and it had to vent but the hell will freeze over before we learn anything about that ), 
  yeah dont you find it a bit suspicious having 2 such an events between months ? 
  not really it was first detected back in october, 
  lets not play with words here we arent some kids we dont know squat they are saying this because of the last incident in hungary https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/source-iodine-131-europe-identified, 
  the former president, 
  so a ) its secret b ) you already know that its russian c ) you already know they are cheating d ) and you already know its for medicine use good job any sources ? 
  make your self a favor and click the links perhaps you will learn 2 or 3 things about the particular isotope comparing a nuclear meltdown that released 8 tons of nuclear material in the air with insignificant amounts of this particular isotope is really wrong at so many levels especially when this particular isotope can be produced from various sources that includes nuclear reactors . . 
  didnt knew that telling the truth is punishable nowdays also assad isnt the only one that used chemical gases on syria you know https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/use_of_chemical_weapons_in_the_syrian_civil_war the confirmed list is huge from both sides including isis . . but they never actually play those as much as when saa did i wonder why . . did un or u.s ever condemnded the usage of chemical gases from the party they are helping ? 
  nope never did thus making us go back to the hypocrisy, 
  literally no news at all http://www.criirad.org/balises/criirad_170214%20_i131_europe_radioactivite.pdf http://www.criirad.org/english/presentation.html an identical article from october about the very same thing http://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/radiation_safety_watchdog_hunts_source_of_radioactive_iodine_tagged_in_air_samples/9261478 every few hours this is going to be played out till they are bored of accussing russia and move on to the next thing that they can also small fact if russia had done a nuclear warhead test everyone would have detected it you cant hide such an explosion from seismometers . . 
  you mean the same pis that the guy is using his own dead brother as a political tool since 2011 ? 
  so [ sprudo ] ( https://www.google.gr/search?q=spurdo&amp;oq=spurdo&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=utf-8 ) exists afterall, 
  its not wrong they do accept him as the ruler regardless of what you say ( on which even russia has agreed that he needs to go after the war is done ) that is politics my friend russia has quite a lot of interest down there its not like they are denying what assad has done because they love him in the same category is me asking if obama will admit the thousands of people his drone buddies killed, 
  i think you need to change your views a bit ... and start from the fact that only turkey and saudi arabia doesnt accept assad as the ruler of syria . . the rest of the world till yesterday still accepts assad as the ruler the hypocrisy starts far behind, 
  tomorrow the new headline will be germany three-point stance clothesline russia over ukraine heathens passports, 
  every time i hear about `` heart attacks '' on high level diplomats i always bring into my mind this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsenurbapdm, 
  normally i would have agreed but given that this specific isotope can come from various places ( even from natural gas ) finding the source will be next to impossible, 
  their safety record says otherwise actually infact russia is one of the countries with the lower nuclear accidents in the world . . and the one time they had to vent gas out they publicly said so https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1964097/more_nuclear_disasters_likely_from/ blaming russia for everything especially when we dont know nothing isnt really the way to go, 
  do you have any evidence that you can give that can exclude greenland or russia ? 
  or any of the nuclear reactors on the vicinity of that huge area ? 
  no obviously no because ** newsflash ** russia isnt the only user of nuclear materials in the area, 
  given the path of the jetstream we can easly put on that list greenland . . ( but we dont really know the condition of the nuclear waste storage there . . ) and russia, 
  you do realise that this particular event dates back from 1918 till now eh ... in all seriousness if you want to blame someone for that mess you should blame georgia first since 1991 . . 
  what im trying to say is that this became news ( again ) because they are blaming russia with as always zero to none evidence check this out to see how insignificant those readings are http://www.criirad.org/balises/criirad_170214%20_i131_europe_radioactivite.pdf http://www.criirad.org/english/presentation.html also check this out http://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/radiation_safety_watchdog_hunts_source_of_radioactive_iodine_tagged_in_air_samples/9261478 back from october and yet it didnt got to the mainstream media if you can guess why it never made it to the news you will win a cookie :p, 
  but those readings are couple of thousand less than the french recorded months after the fukushima accident and they didnt even gave a damn cause obviously the reading were small this is literally no news at all, 
  this is the view of my [ home ] ( http://i.imgur.com/z59iacp.jpg ) this is the [ beach ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jxszzit.jpg ) 200m from my home, 
  i highly doubt it will be a sensible choice since the f16s can literally get the same electronics, 
  there have been quite a lot of incidents and `` incidents '' between them, 
  a typical day in greece can you imagine the shit we will see once they get the first f35s ? ... 
  okinawa is calling they want their 60 + years old hypocrisy, 
  the gospel of st schaeuble when its going to be released ? 
  no there is not its not like it changed anything with him on the helm russians are still very religious just like any other country with orthodoxy as the main religion even latvia they dont need a puppet to control the masses because in most cases they follow the rules blindly i mean look at [ this ] ( http://www.pappaspost.com/greek-church-says-forget-your-yoga-incompatible-with-orthodox-christianity/ ) in every other country such a thing would have produced tons of laughs but here in greece they thought it was a good move ( and its not even a good translation of the actual article that the head of orthodoxy in greece said that yoga is basicly a demon tool to corrupt our souls ) and im not even gon na mention how many times the head of the church here went on public to fight the new id system ( some years ago ) saying that because it will be digital and it will have our info and it will remove the religious term people must fight it because its the way satan choose to corrupt the youth ( and the other typical 666 madness barcodes bla bla . . ) and the fun part is he actually successed to stop back then the production of the new id 's ... 
  try again very few countries literally doesnt give a fuck about religion 90 % of them do use it for various reasons from political show up to going into war . . 
  name a country that doesnt use the religion to control the mass ... 
  i wont be suprised if * they faked his death * he faked his death ( in both cases because probably he knew that he was next on someones list ) either way he did caused quite a lot of trouble for both sides with his decisions ... but https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9k05cbxmqe&amp;t he had style, 
  wasnt cornwall that voted for exit and yet they wanted eu to keep sending them money ? 
  * these were math symbols right ? 
  ** died lol, 
  and still no official word from europe itself . . 
  gdp alone doesnt mean squat http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/russia/publication/rer as you can see russian economy despite what the `` media '' is saying is actually growing faster than it was before the sanctions ... also that notion of having `` an army rusting '' is just stupid ... whoever thinks that russia since 2003 and after is just sitting on their asses and doing nothing needs to wake up and see what is going on ... 
  [ this article is always relevant ] ( https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2008/08/12/the-united-states-shares-the-blame-for-the-russia-georgia-crisis ), 
  [ france knows whats up ] ( http://www.delta-integrale.com/images/mtk/content/exterieur_3.jpg ), 
  ofc it was almost 70 % of greece ( according to historians ofc ) was full with slavs on adidas russian vickings and stuff, 
  but we know that most of the greece on 8-9th century was full with slavic tribes some dna of them must have been preserved obviously, 
  at least this dna test shed some light into what happened to the minoans after the santorini decided to blow up, 
  so greeks are greeks and the first ancient bankrupcy happened in greece also seems like a full circle, 
  [ he was right all along ] ( https://cdn.sfstation.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ancientaliens.png ), 
  no the events he describes started almost 2 decades later than the official declaration of trans being an autonomous political entity, 
  i really hope this will be the event that will cause the greek gov to finally invest on a tsunami alert system ... 
  i dont think you know the history of trans as good as you think you know it ... 
  romania that had an almost 8.0 mg should be as dark as possible . . half of greece should be as dark as possible same goes for central and south italy all dark ... tenerife while it doesnt produce really big earthquakes it has cumbre vieja which has collapsed so many times creating tsunamis big enough that had lay waste on everything that is facing the atlantic in europe ... 
  well you will be suprised how much business usa is doing with russia ( generally its on 10 to 15 billions per year and while its not much most of them deal on areas that usa needs mainly on the rocket engines and exchange of technology about rockets ) the problem is the pipeline directly bypass ukraine something that obama didnt want to cause ukraine was shutting down the pipeline and asking for compensations ... the sanctions on iran didnt do much good either since neither japan or the asia in general nor europe followed in reality the money iran will spend in airbus alone is enough to flip the americans off and so is what they did i mean the only thing usa actually did on that case it to not let iran to buy directly from usa and since europe is a lot closer well . . ( i mean the deal iran had with boeing is literally the 75 % of boeings operating income somedays i just cant help thinking if this is a retaliation from trump given how he hated the inflation boeing did to upgrade the presidential and the navy aircrafts . . ), 
  worldbank isnt russian ... nor any stock exchange that can show you the rise of the ruble but ok http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/russia/publication/rer http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=usd&amp;to=rub&amp;view=5y notice when the opec started to price the oil back to idiotic numbers then compare it, 
  well you cant pass a bill that wont do any good in the end now can you ... ruble since the first sanctions is rising and rising . . the economy of russia according with the world bank is also rising with a big growth despite having the sanctions . . so what good it will be to impost more sanction since the first wave which was the worst didnt do anything ? 
  10/10 would pay to see laysha dancing with the bare minimum, 
  it wasnt a ripoff it was a japanese version of it with more boobs and asses and no penis, 
  some time ago i stumbled upon [ this ] ( https://grenfellactiongroup.wordpress.com/2016/11/20/kctmo-playing-with-fire/ ) sad that this actually happened . . 
  see when im talking with number i always can back it up . . the c variant is almost 6000 pounds heavier it has a bigger wing span and can carry 1500 pounds less fuel than the a variant plus it needs to reserve 30 % of its fuel for potential go arounds on sea plus the c will most likely carry external bombs as well so add to that a very increasing drag . . its not as simple as you might think ... [ and i know this how ? 
  ] ( http://csbaonline.org/research/publications/airsea-battle-concept/ ) the threat to the tankers exists from the moment that both russia and china developed pak fa and j20 reds never have anything more than cgi unless they changed only on this occassion and since we dont know shit about this scenario its most likely that they didnt had i said the proposed armament not what it carries now as a prototype half of what its going to get its a rip off of russian guided bombs and ats missiles ah yeah i mistook it with the monstrocity of pak ta what you mean shtorm goes by many names ? 
  you cant possibly suggest that because they had several projects it means that they will all fall into the same category especially when almost all of them dont have anything to do with shtorm apart from being carriers . . actually they have built quite a lot of stuff since 2009 but anyways we know they gon na built it on sevmash its the only logical solution since it has the capacity ( initially the dry docks were created to handle 120.000 tons ships before the final design of their carriers came to be ) but they dont have the logistics for it, 
  the maximum radius on ferry is 1110 km on the c variant the maximum on a typical payload is 833km on the b variant a is just retarded version so no one cares about that yeah but as i said when you give one team a big advantage of having an awacs while the reds gets cgi you cant really say `` look at the score '' i mean you made the f35 to blind spec the enemy cgi so that others can strike without a problem unless this was the scenario and they just failed to mention it . . well in order for them to be threatened they need to actually get in combat with a decent enemy first i highly doubt usa will go to war with anyone remotely close to their level for so many reasons . . the milestone c is delayed as far as they told the press but no reasons given china refers to j20 as a bomber helps that the proposed armament is 90 % air to surface missiles and some conventional bombs and only 2 short to mid distance ata missiles pak da wasnt even a russian desing it was a fan made video as for shtorm pretty sure it came on 2011 . . initially they had plans for 13 now its 6 plus some new sub design that will use only supercavitating torpedoes ( saw it on themess.net ), 
  no its actually very simple once you get to know what you are looking for its a well known exercise that literally nothing has changed since millions of years we know for example that they did release roe when the su30mki were there we know that they do release the weapons types available we know that they do release the threat profiles we do know that they ( eventually ) release the third party support they had ( pods and stuff ) we do know that the 64 aggr is using f16 block 32 the absolute lowest and bare version of f16 that ever existed we do know that the reds can rely only on cgi ( and given the ability of the f22 and f35 to blind them well lets say they are a non player ) to guide them while the blues can use awacs and whatever else they can bring this number is the same as back in vietnam era where we can see similiar numbers against mig21s and 17s simulated by f4s but in reality we dont have anything to compare this number because simply they didnt release anything this time but even if the f35 had a gazzilion problems we will never find out no one would love to have their 100 million per unit aircraft on news for bad stunts the same shit we saw on dact http://aviationintel.com/in-response-to-reports-of-simulated-f-22-raptor-kills-by-german-eurofighters/ but but but ... something sneaky happened and a serious website actually managed to talk to a fighter pilot that was actually on the red flag this year !, 
  who said that they didnt fly with the f22s ? 
  what do you think the other 4 was ? 
  p51s ? 
  the fact that they still dont want to talk about the roles of the f22 and just provide bs statements its enough really ( remember how detailed and pathetic their analysis was when the su 30 mki came on red flag ? 
  yeah . . ) for those that are old enough to know what we are talking about see this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/millennium_challenge_2002 one of the many examples of how you just use the propaganda to create your own hype, 
  and as i said to the other guy usaf has yet to release a statement on the role of the f22s on the scenario we know they were escorted by 4f22s and if they were blinding the whole sky in order for the f35 to get strike kills then no that kda is as usefull as me saying north korea will launch a missile that will actually hit something,
