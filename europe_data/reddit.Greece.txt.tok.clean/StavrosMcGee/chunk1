i ca n't figure out if it 's a joke about greeks being waiters and restauranteurs abroad ( although that would be a weird way to bring it up , talking about uniforms ) , or because you can wear white in the mediterranean and it looks good . 
  either way , it 's not about the economic crisis or ancient greece or tourism to mykonos : we 're movin ' on up the meme ladder !, 
  bit of an aside , but my family always bitches about halloween being american capitalist excesses or something , but then they go hard for apokries all the way to clean monday , which i 'm all for truth be told . 
  apokries is way more fun than halloween . 
  some of the bars and clubs on valaoritou in thessaloniki celebrate halloween . 
  hell , i just looked it up , and there 's even a day of the dead celebration at a mexican restaurant by the white tower . 
  i never thought i 'd hear about that in greece . 
  wow , you must really not want the various western europe polities who interacted with the eastern roman empire on a regular , destructive basis to be wrong , do n't you ? 
  someone get this man a gold medal for all those mental gymnastics he 's doing , bravo !, 
  if the walloons and flemish had n't been so prone to fighting amongst themselves and being locked in an inefficient political-union ruled by a german king , maybe they would n't have been invaded by germany ... ... twice . 
  see how ridiculous that sounds ? 
  the veneto-crusader sack of constantinople succeeded in april of 1204 . 
  when the e. roman remnant finally took back the city 57 years later in 1261 , they found the city in such disrepair that they discovered * the ruins of buildings burned down by looters in 1204 , never repaired , and abandoned . 
  * venetian and crusader greed drove the city into the ground . 
  the dismemberment of the european & some of the asian possessions of the empire started a chain of events that signaled the death-knell of the roman empire and it was all thanks to the machinations of venetian oligarchs and a band of zealous thugs stupid enough to do their bidding . 
  the venetians were hellbent on completely nullifying any threat to their stream of revenue : that an opportunistic pretender came to them for help is a complete coincidence . 
  if the angeloi had not come to enrico dandolo , he would have found another reason to get the crusaders to invade . 
  in case you want to say `` but the pope said the sack was wrong , '' not that you would , because around here seems to be a clich\u00e9 , self-styled dawkinsian atheist ) , he put up a contrived , weak protest and when the deeds were done and the crusaders had the seat of the ecumenical patriarchate in their hands , he accepted the situation without thinking twice about it , and the spoils of war . 
  do you have a reading list on amazon ? 
  if so , add anything by s. runciman or charles c. oman to it . 
  yeah , and when those latins ' captain , giovanni giustiniani , was wounded , the entire group of ragtag venetians , genoese , aragonese , anconans , and other assorted westerners fucked off back to genoese-occupied chios , dodging ottoman ships along the way , in order to lie low and hide there and wait out the siege . 
  the latin defection was a huge blow to the haggard and nigh-destitute force left defending the city . 
  shit , just about * every * western european intervention into the affairs of the eastern roman empire started with incompetence and ended in sectarian infighting , betrayal , and ruin . 
  what 's next , you going to tell us that those latin mercenaries who fled at manzikert were just doing the right thing or that roberto guiscardo slashed and burned his way across the via egnatia in the name of freedom and liberation ? 
  i have fond memories of discussing this topic with a professor of mine in his class on shi'a islam a couple years back . 
  i asked if there could be a school of jurisprudence for muslims in western europe just as some schools , like say the hanafi school , are said to fit one ethnic group best ( if i recall correctly , he said that the hanafi school `` had a turkic soul '' ) . 
  this german minister certainly is n't the first to suggest that there needs to be a new development of islam in non-islamic lands . 
  france has been trying for several years now : 1 . ),

  http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/08/french-foundation-administer-build-mosques-160801133029106.html 3 . ), 
  http://m.france24.com/en/20160830-french-head-france-islam-foundation-sparks-controversy i know it 's a clich\u00e9 , but change like this is going to have to come from within . 
  * i * personally do n't think that the french government 's initiatives have been bringing it closer to the goal of the gallicization of islam within its borders , but i would love to be proven wrong . 
  i might get a lot of flack for this here , but in my studies of the maghreb and the flood of immigration to france post 1961 , there 's such a vicious cycle that france 's current endeavors ( and germany 's potential ones ) might be decades to late . 
  at the same time , i 'm of the belief that islam is n't a religion with political trappings but a political system with religious trappings ( fuck it , downvote me to hell , it was bound to happen sometime ) . 
  obedience and rigorously following the the law brought by subsequent waves of prophets that culminated with mohammad is just about the only way to get closer to god in islam . 
  i do not think that you can have islam without its law code , and in a perfect world , its law code states that there should be a world state governed by the tenets of islam . 
  that unnerves me as a non-muslim and is totally undesirable . 
  i question to what degree of compatibility any school of jurisprudence can truly be to a state not governed by sharia . 
  i do not question the loyalty of millions of individuals to their states . 
  i question an entire overarching structure of scholars with their power to interpret 1,400 years of legal precedents based on a text that can never `` truly '' be translated.t, 
  touch\u00e9 . 
  i googled it real fast , and yeah , it seems like the burka recently came in-vogue in roma villages . 
  said article made no mention of its wearing in the pomak or turkish communities . 
  hell the only time * i 've * seen any sort of balkan person wear it is in historical photographs from the 19th century , and one time on the bus in thessaloniki . 
  y' ever been to bulgaria , m8 ? 
  there are two kinda of indigenous muslim groups ( pomaks and turks , three if you count the tiny muslim roma community ) and sofia has a couple thousand syrian refugees living in veritable shantytowns outside the city limits . 
  i saw two free syrian army flags before i saw anyone hanging any eu memberstate flags when i visited in april of 2015 . 
  this effects a decent amount of people . 
  bulgaria 's third largest party is the turkish party , so i can imagine this will only alienate its members in parliament . 
  it might not be at germany levels , but your joke still falls flat . 
  why give a base to anyone ? 
  why should greece or any other country have the burden of defending the island ? 
  but point well taken ; there 's really only one country in the region that 's looking to expand its geopolitical influence whether by freewill or coercion . 
  well in that case , you must be in favor of expanding the greek military presence in lefkosia and giving them their old base in the north back as a permanent base . 
  i 'm sure your view will be popular with all of us who have not yet done our fantaros ; greek soldiers stationed in cyprus get a stipend of $ 80 a month if i recall correctly . 
  i 'm always reticent in sharing my opinions here in r/europe because of how much of a shitshow every single discussion erupts into , but fuck it , this is just objectively hypocritical . 
  if one is going to be in favor in guaranteeing autonomy for one group on the island and a foreign military base , then let 's guarantee it for all in the spirit of balance . 
  while we 're at it , perhaps a vatican military base to protect the rights of the levantine minority group might be in order , and the republic of armenia can guarantee the safety of those armenians left in the south as well . 
  let 's not forget releasing some ex-lebanese falangists into the countryside to always look after the maronites of kormak\u00edtis as well !, 
  sometimes , i find it fun to share my personal beliefs and life experiences on reddit . 
  as a diaspora greek returning to greece , i find it fun to experience life for greeks in different parts of the mediterranean . 
  i 've had coffee at caf\u00e9 byzas with the rum minority & done light repairwork for the kandili rum cemetery . 
  i 've played basketball with thessalonikian anarchists . 
  i 've ridden the train with roma from athens to thessaloniki and helped taken care of a sick child . 
  i 've had lunch with new greeks from sichuan , china & roasted lambs with my fellow arvanites in the cavo d'oro region of euboea . 
  cyprus was the place where i felt the least amount of kinship with the populace ; my shared language & religious did not help me find common ground . 
  hell , my ` american ' - american friends fucking bonded with the fucking boozed-up goon squad that is the british contingency of bartenders/waiters , tourists , and pensioners on the island while i sat that with a glass of zivania and orange juice making `` u wot m8 '' jokes about the most deplorable group of people abroad i have ever had the misfortune of being stuck in the same bar in . 
  i found the native , greek-cypriot people to be difficult to deal with not just because i had trouble understanding them as someone who had previously only been used to chicago greeklish & more ` standard ' greek , but because i just simply did not click with any cypriot . 
  hell , nigh two years later , i do n't really care that i had a less-than pleasant experience in cyprus ; we have diverged as a people in my sincere opinion . 
  i am a \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03c2 / kalamar\u00e1s ( squid ) and proud of it . 
  my theory is that perhaps , even now , a shared identity based solely off of being from this island of saints & sinners irregardless of ethnic affiliation can be achieved . 
  a permanent , turkish military base is not even * remotely * a way to achieve that goal . 
  minor nitpick -- it was arvanites & muslim albanians ( formerly called `` turcoalbanians '' ) that made up most of athens . 
  i 'm not ruling out that there were no aromanians/vlachs that made their way to attiki , but back then attiki , euboea ( where my arvanite ancestors come from by way of the abandoned petalioi islands ) , & the peloponnesos were all inhabited by hellenized arvanites , bilingual speakers , & even monolingual villages . 
  vlachs are more of a central/northern/western people . 
  it 's in ipeiros that the two groups met , attiki i assume less so ( but i 'd love to be proven wrong , the study of ethnolinguistic minorities is lacking ) . 
  i actually kind of like this one of pre-independence athens . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_athens#/media/file%3abazar_of_athens.jpg i 've seen places in marrakesh and komotini that vaguely remind me of this composition . 
  let 's also not forget there used to be a mosque inside hadrian 's library . 
  http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4dtri1-6ues/ulhytqcs_ji/aaaaaaaadfw/dzms-pkq3dc/s1600/church+sta+skalia%252c+monastiraki%252c+athens+%252826%2529800x++greek+salad+-+a+blog+from+greece.jpg & https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/peytier_-_mosque_in_the_parthenon.jpg ( ignore the title , that is most definitely not the acropolis ) . 
  i ca n't picture monastiraki looking anything like that . 
  this is my favorite painting of 19th century athens , by rizos . 
  for those of you who do n't speak greek , it 's called `` athenian night on the rooftop/terrace . '', 
  it was exhibited in 1897 ( either fresh from crete or one his way there ) and shows a young officer on a date and a chaperone silently guards/judges the shit out of them . 
  my how things have changed . 
  it 's also a pluralized word that 's neither male nor female and all together it means `` good christbirth [ to you ] '' . 
  i looked up what two words `` christmas '' is made up of , and it turns out that '' - mas '' comes from `` mass , '' and is used here to mean christ 's holy day . 
  i vaguely remember being told that `` mas '' was the anglo saxon word for birth when i was a small child , too young to even know what anglo saxon was , but hey , the clue was in the name the entire time . 
  as december is just about the only month i 've never been in greece , i do n't know what phrase ( s ) are used to wish someone a merry christmas . 
  i always felt like saying `` \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03b1 '' was a bit of an anglicism and `` \u03c7\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac '' was about all you said , with the third christmastide greeting of `` \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03ac\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 ! '' really only being used in a church setting . 
  i 'd love for a real greek person to set the record straight because otherwise i 'll never learn how authentic wishing someone a `` \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac \u03c7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03b1 ! '' is . 
  i kind of wish i could go back in time and hear the different accents and what they sounded like in greece before the advent of mass media . 
  people my age all more or less speak a very standardized form of greek . 
  i was born and raised in the us , so obviously i sound noticeably different from my peers , so please take everything i say with a grain of salt . 
  regionalisms and unique turns of phrase in greek i believe are dying . 
  people would tease me back home : `` oh you 're moving to thessaloniki , do n't come back only saying ' \u03bc\u03b5 ' & ' \u03c3\u03b5 ' ! '', 
  and `` the l 's of thessaloniki are really long sounding , '' but i did n't hear any difference at all , really . 
  i ca n't even think of any specific time i 've heard `` \u03c3\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf \u03ad\u03b4\u03c9\u03c3\u03b1 '' or `` \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b5\u03af\u03c0\u03b5 '' . 
  if you 're not actually looking for like the one thing that 's supposed to divide southern accents from northern ones , it 's not really that noticeable in my opinion . 
  only in kozani is any northern accent super noticeable , and that 's only because of influences from pontian refugees that came after the population exchange i was told .
