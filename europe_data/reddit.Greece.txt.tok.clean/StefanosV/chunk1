`` i am sorry because i am getting old and i shall not live long to thank the greek people , whose resistance decided ww ii . '', 
  joseph stalin `` historical justice forces me to admit that among all the enemies who stand against us , the greek soldier above all , fought with the most courage . 
  he surrendered himself only when the continuation of resistance was not possible any longer , and when he had no reason not to ... 
  however , he fought so bravely , that even his enemies can not deny their respect for him ... 
  thus , the greek prisoners of war were released immediately , having in mind the heroic stance of these soldiers . '', 
  adolph hitler , reichstag , 4 may 1941 a german officer of the air force declared to the commander of the eastern macedonia division group , lieutenant general dedes , that the greek arm was the first army on which the stuka fighter planes did not cause panic . 
  `` your soldiers '' he said , `` instead of fleeing frantically , as they did in france and poland , were shooting at us from their positions . '', 
  `` you fought unarmed and won , small against big . 
  we owe you gratitude , because you gave us time to defend ourselves . 
  as russians and as people we thank you . '',

  sarcasm , i know you 're german and your sense of humor is as dry as the rub ' al khali , but seriously , if you ca n't tell i was joking you must have some social development problem, 
  i-if ... if we go to `` light side '' can we still keep goat ? 
  horrible . 
  broken promises , upon mountains of lies . 
  not surprised this is typically what happens when you vote in leftists . 
  im not . 
  i actually want to get out of the eurozone as soon as possible, 
  do n't try to act sad german we know your game , we have been playing trick on you all along !, 
  now your evil fourth reich will end , greece will leave the euro and start domino effect of eurozone , soon other countries will follow and soon the euro will be thing of the past !, 
  and greece will have freed europe from the oppressive chains put on us . 
  good i agree with these germans , lets go already !, 
  well you should . 
  yes because everyone in the world is `` human '' right and you think nations are an uneeded `` social construct '' just to give you a reality check , all the values you love , your ideology , your world view , whatever it is , there is someone out there that fucking hates it , some even want to take it from you . 
  if you like belgium , and it 's values , than you should be willing to fight for it . 
  but the west does n't do propaganda !, 
  never !, 
  of course you are . 
  `` unational '' coward, 
  nothing is good about having a country of spineless cowards, 
  white shores and beyond , a far green country into a swift sunrise . 
  because i love my country , and my people . 
  as a former raider of the hellenic army . 
  you have my goats if the day ever comes, 
  agreed , i 'm embarrassed of my countries 54 %, 
  im so disappointing in greeks right now , knowing they would n't fight for their homeland , maybe it 's the economic crisis . 
  this is sad though . 
  seeing such a low `` 54 % '' actually is upsetting me right now , i would give my life for my country and people i wish there was more information though , such as who was polled , which age groups , gender , ect . 
  if it was all men being polled 54 % is just shamful . 
  anything under 75 % is shameful . 
  got ta let the yiayia squeeze and kiss your cheeks or shell nag the whole time you 're with her . 
  turkey is a more of a `` we do n't really like you , but you offer us some pretty dope strategic locations important for the middle east , so we 'll shake hands and smile '' kinda ally, 
  no offense you 're traditional outfits look really f **** stupid [ * looks at some of our traditional outfits * ] ( https://www.nioras.com/images/229107.jpg ) i-i 'll see myself out . 
  it 's not bribe comrade , it is gift to friend , why ? 
  you no give gift to your friends ? 
  is this western values , how you treat friends ? 
  i hope you do okay buddy . 
  pretty sure she is a god believing christian considering she says stuff like '' `` i believe in god , and religion is also my constant companion , and actually has been my entire life . '' `` i find it very liberating that as a christian , one can make mistakes , '' she added . 
  `` that one knows there is something higher than just human beings , and that we are also called on to shape the world in responsibility for others . 
  this is a framework for my life , which i consider very important . '' also the cdu is both catholic and protestant . 
  not just catholic, 
  a lot . 
  i do n't see what you 're getting at, 
  have you read artical 13 of the greek constitution ? 
  do you know what the word theocracy means ? 
  makes sense , considering we have an openly atheist prime minister how many `` secular '' european countries would even consider voting in an atheist https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/religious-beliefs-of-european-leaders_mapbuilder3.png?w=1024, 
  is n't that any political movement ? 
  anything that usually devolves into arguing, 
  i live in chania, 
  best of luck to you, 
  why do so many scandinavians die from drug overdose ? 
  is there a lot of drug use in sweden , norway , ect ? 
  surprising coming from countries with such `` high '' standards of living . 
  pun intended, 
  funny cause i said the same for finland !, 
  haha greece is very social by the way , a little too social . 
  to the point of annoyance . 
  one thing for me , that always gets me is going to scandinavian countries , i feel like people just do n't talk to each other while out in public . 
  still nice countries non the less , especially sweden, 
  well played . 
  well played . 
  one of my posts actually got posted to srs . 
  i started getting replies like a week later on a random joke i made about sweden being ruled by sjw 's . 
  i do n't think people there have humor . 
  born in greece , grew up as a child in ano symi on symi , until i was around 13 ( https://www.google.gr/maps/place/%ce%a3%cf%8d%ce%bc%ce%b7/@36.615929,27.836176,3a,63.6y,11.17h,95.76t/data=!3m5!1e1!3m3!1scsnftjaa8w0aaaqyenn5xq!2e0!3e11!4m2!3m1!1s0x14be2bddca4cd501:0x3c24766d4b1da10a!6m1!1e1 ) then moved with my family to gaios , ( https://www.google.gr/maps/place/%ce%93%ce%ac%ce%b9%ce%bf%cf%82/@39.197784,20.186103,3a,75y,156.91h,86.29t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s-ci9rl3xmp6khalhyewqqa!2e0!4m2!3m1!1s0x135c8d05567f0271:0x72435d2c340d713!6m1!1e1 ) then went to school did a bunch of other things including studying in america and now , and for the last few year i live in chania ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/chania,+greece/@35.517464,24.016044,3a,75y,123.01h,90t/data=!3m5!1e1!3m3!1shwwq8n-azhwaaaqxr3lxnw!2e0!3e11!4m2!3m1!1s0x149c7dbee0cf3f3b:0x94b3557d79cd2ca8!6m1!1e1 ) and plan to move back to symi, 
  i 've been to sweden plenty of times . 
  im guessing you do n't understand humorous statements , are you from sweden ? 
  would explain your dry humor, 
  german comedy standards = as funny as watching paint dry ? 
  austria , the countryside is amazingly beautiful, 
   gambling , cheap booze , food , prostitution sounds like istanbul, 
  i live in chania , so it 's pretty amazing tbh . 
  hungarians are from the ural mountains . 
  so europe . 
  specifically believed to originated from an area between the the urals are actually considered the northern boundary of europe http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/uralmountains1.png slavs are from europe as well . 
  as they are from west of the ural mountains from areas around the baltic , ukraine , and western russia , all theroies of proto-slavic orgions places there homeland in eastern europe : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/27/slavarchaeology.png turkic people originated close to places like tibet smack in the middle of asia this is asia : http://www.clker.com/cliparts/m/x/n/y/y/8/asian-continent-hi.png this is europe : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/europe_orthographic_caucasus_urals_boundary.svg/537px-europe_orthographic_caucasus_urals_boundary.svg.png also again , im talking excluding turkey as a state not turks in general , just turkey , and turks in turkey . 
  i think it would be fair to exclude them because the overwhelming majority of the nation is not european, 
   first female combat fighter pilot sabiha g\u00f6k\u00e7en !, 
  theres also an airport named after her in istanbul . 
  was n't there a huge contervisory a few years back about someone claiming she was armenian , or something ? 
  i was n't saying you have no right to answer the question , i was saying it would be fair to exclude you actually , what i said is would be fair to exclude turkey in particular , not turks . 
  `` excluding turkey is reasonable though . '', 
  not `` excluding turks reasonable though . '', 
  the reason i think it 's more than fair to exclude turkey , is because turkey is disproportionately majority asian , and is n't ethnically european, 
  i said you have had a historical relationship with europeans , but you are n't european . 
  i really do n't see whats the big deal unless you are insecure being a turk ? 
  turkey is a country with a rich history , and culture , but it 's not a european nation . 
  it 's an asian one , that just has some territory in europe , turkey has more in common with middle eastern nations than in europe , and has played an even bigger role in that region, 
  i never said you do n't belong in europe , im just saying you are n't europeans .
