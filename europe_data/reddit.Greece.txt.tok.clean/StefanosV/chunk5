  i would hope the first thing you 'd do is get rid of that god awful facial hair, 
  in greece . 
  thats not a niqab . 
  its a headscarf , orthodox woman sometimes wear them especially the older generation of greek women it 's a yiayia stereotype https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x4_clst9hg, 
   a row over a clothes line . 
  row can sometimes be used to say dispute . 
  so a dispute over a clothes line . 
  i hope your asking why they chose to use that word and not just commenting on the absurdity of the situation , i do n't wan na look like an idiot . 
  [ why not ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aadqypzoozs pretty much every yiayia ever, 
  easy , all turks are insane . 
  * looks at own country * i. . . 
  i should stop talking, 
  we bring goat to house , and ask if we room for goat . 
  well in the past it was reasonable , today not really unless greece wanted to displace like 18 million people . 
  but in the past before the greek genocide , cultural exchange , the burning of smyrna ect , there where many greek people living in these areas . 
  you forgot an important one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djqdoefjx5y, 
  like la vie en rose ? 
  when you live in a place as warm , and as beautiful in greece , it 's kinda hard to give a shit about anything , which probably explains the shape of our economy right now . 
  when you live in a place like england that 's grey and rainy all the time , and have nothing else to do , like dance on the beach with beautiful women , drinking wine and playing bouzouki , like greeks do , you 'd probably have nothing else to do , but work until the weekend when you can watch football . 
  and be happy for like a day a week . 
  probably why greece has like the lowest suicide rate in europe . 
  even despite our economic crisis . 
  hard to be depressed when you can just party at the beach all day , gulping up ouzo and swimming in the clear blue crystal waters the amount of fucks greeks give -  http://imgur.com/a/iohvv, 
  did n't know warcraft had a band, 
  right , sure . 
  the only reason turkey has a realtivly high gfp is due to their population and manpower available , something like 30,000,000 . 
  you take that advantage away and they have an incredibly weak military with very outdated equipment and horrible logistics , with corruption throughout their forces and leadership . 
  russia has more manpower than turkey so they do not have that advantage . 
  even greece has a better tank fleet , equipped with modern leopard tanks . 
  turkey 's primary tanks are the freaking leopard 1 's . 
  from west germany , and leopard a2 's . . and 4 's anything less that an a5 is pretty useless against russia . 
  you also have a bunch of m48 patton 's which are completely laughable on the battlefield today the fact they are still in service is kinda pathetic . 
  the only modern tank turkey has is the altay , and they are prototypes and you only have 4 of them . 
  not to mention turkeys airforce is a joke compared to russias . 
  russia has way more fighter jets , many of which are actually modern , i do n't think turkey has anything more advanced than f16s , they have more helicopters russia has way more submarines , destroyers ( turkey has zero ) way more corvettes , an aircraft carrier , and a large merchant marine fleet which will provide better logistics during a war . 
  russia has a larger working force , which means better production and they produce a shit ton of oil , and they can actually keep a war going for longer . 
  not to mention the average russian solider is equipped with pretty modern equipment and is much better trained . 
  ( some turkish solders are still using military helmets from eastern germany , ) russian : http://i.imgur.com/rowcfnw.jpg , https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcseqgi8pprkktk2ittaavdxhjrlfkq4e93bpleyv8150kgdmsjj_g turkish : http://img.rt.com/files/opinionpost/24/60/10/00/12.si.jpg http://im.haberturk.com/2012/03/16/725293_detay.jpg?1331896745 russia vs turkey would n't end well for turkey , esicaplly if turkey attacked on their soil , with their poor logistics , and navy . 
  maybe they could put up a pretty good fight if they where on the defense , they would still lose , but they 'd be able to hold out much longer . 
  so basically this : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lebensraum seemed to work out well the first time , good luck with that .

  fuck off mate . 
  i would love to see this aswell . 
  `` saved '', 
  spain cant seem to get that last little piece, 
  the balkans fixed . 
  you 're wel - i mean uh . 
  how to win fights over the internet with turks and slavic macedonians on alexander the great videos . 
  also when should siesta time be , 4pm ? 
  3pm ? , perhaps 5pm ? 
  turkey , being raised greek i was taught how to hate turks unconditionally and hunt them , but actually going to ankara and izmir , they where really cool people , and nobody tried to murder me for being greek . 
  \u1d4f\u1d49\u1d47\u1d43\u1d47 \u1d43\u1d9c\u1d57\u1d58\u1d43\u1dab\u1dab\u02b8 \u1d57\u1d43\u02e2\u1d57\u1d49\u02e2 \u02b3\u1d49\u1d43\u1dab\u1dab\u02b8 \u1d4d\u1d52\u1d52\u1d48, 
  do people go to finland for vacation i here its so depressing up there people kill themselves cause the weather . 
  the world loves to hate ` murica till they need them . 
  yeah bulgaria has a weak military with mostly cold war era equipment , but they are strong compared to macedonia . 
  but they are n't going to fighting macedonia just guarding the border, 
  shit they know , shut it down !, 
  maria , hide the drachma !, 
  i would consider japan much like turkey . 
  it 's west to a degree , but not really . 
  japan is still a very xenophobic and isolated society . 
  it 's culture is very conservative and traditional , not that it 's bad but not many similarities can be drawn between western and japanese culture outside of fashion and entertainment , not saying it 's a bad thing , i believe japan should by all means preserve and love their culture . 
  i would n't call japanese culture `` western '' though , south korea maybe . 
  eu , america , uk , australia , new zealand, 
  sweden actually denies visa 's ? 
  what you mean comrade ? 
  russian make potato if not u.s stop us . 
  this is trolling 101, 
  thank you russia for inventions like the radio , and your vast achievements in areas like computing and space technology , also thank you for stopping the nazis . 
  and helping my country gain independence , your great composers and artists , and most of all thank you for ushanka . 
  lmao clay ? 
  fuck the eu coming straight from the underground a young yanni got it bad cause im olived skinned . 
  enclava is ethnic greek land !, 
  we shall annex this petty state immediately welcome to the balkans m **** f *** er, 
  https://youtu.be/dmytbdvqvk8?t=64 so you 're telling me as a child you never played with army men , and toy guns ? 
  you never been interested in tanks , fighter planes . 
  ect . 
  please . 
  i do n't know what kind of kid you where but i 'd have an orgasm whenever i saw a squadron of fighter planes fly by in formation , my eyes would light up when i saw soldiers marching in sync , and badass tanks rolled by . 
  comments like these are really starting to make me think about how sensitive the west is becoming . 
  they are only `` evil '' if they are used for evil . 
  military parades are positive family events , to see some badass stuff , like tanks spinning around , and planes doing backflips . 
  nobody is going to these to admire how these things can kill people , haha would you say the same thing about military movies , or video games ? 
  r/eourpe is very russiaphobic , say anything positive about russia and you 'll be down-voted into oblivion, 
   tovarich whats wrong with that . 
  russia is a progressive state that uses gender neutral terms !, 
  it is a very serious subject . 
  and yes i would say it is more important than the economy , at least to the government , we barely cut spending to our defense budget, 
  if she considers herself a `` person of colour '' shes delusional, 
  `` some of the best '' not `` the best '', 
  i would hope so , i would be concerned if you guys where still using muskets and horse cavalry, 
  yes they are on our 300 + leopard 2 tanks . 
  people put drachma in them as they pass by the new 170 leopard 2a6 hel tanks have the biggest alms bag . 
  so we can keep them running we also have em on our f-16 's, 
  by ww2 standards it was, 
  just because it took along time does n't mean it was n't peaceful due to norwegian terrain , it should have took that long . 
  it took the axis a year to take greece , does n't mean it was the most violent place in ww2 . 
  looking at the numbers only 9,500 where actually killed . 
  thats very small scale for ww2 .
