  switzerland ? 
  eh . . no they are n't welcome here, 
  i do n't see anything wrong with it to be honest they are all european , the swede is on the far right , the pole to the left of ( insert gender pronoun here ) finland has the pink robe , spain is playing with the football , germany has that funny hat thing , france is in the yellow tank-top with portugal behind , norway in the fur coat , russia on the far left , the guy playing with the truck is hungary, 
  shut it down guys, 
  lucky spain , ca n't wait to get rid of our socialists, 
  greece 100 % europe , camel only donkey and goat, 
  [ turks trying to convince us their not middle eastern , lol ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jj6ghhb.jpg ), 
  yes we are let 's be honest . 
  there is still dutch people though with their fucking waffles and clog shoes, 
   why is every traffic sign riddled with bulletholes ? 
  # [ because you 're in kriti malakas ] ( http://i.imgur.com/s8tcm9e.jpg ) cretan also never forget evil [ german invaders ] ( http://i.imgur.com/87bhqj9.jpg ) we spit in german food when they make order special revenge dish for german tourists xaxaxaxa, 
   cretans might get some scary autonomy , but all systems have their faults . 
  # * shoots ak into the air * #fuck off malakas #\u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u1f7c\u03bd \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03ad !!!, 
  #mainlanders btfo, 
  still it 's annoying because it creates hostile feeling between our two countries , which kinda sucks because after the earthquake diplomacy we were kinda on a good road . 
  i agree , as would anyone with a brain , the arguments used are completely ridiculous too , like the one in the article it 's an `` echo away '' or it 's a `` stone throw '' away , therefore it should be ours , which is hilarious when you think about it , considering that 's literally the definition of a `` border '' it 's like saying france should annex saarbr\u00fccken because it 's right next to the border . 
  the majority of the world borders a country that is a `` stone throw away '' it 's the whole point of a border . 
  the turks never adhered to it as the article mentions . 
  the treaty guaranteed the rights of minorities and equality before the law and that clearly was n't the case . 
  they broke it just a few years after ataturk died , to show how much they really cared about the mans ideals they imposed a `` wealth tax '' on non muslim citizens , basically a fancy word for `` jiyza '' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/varl%c4%b1k_vergisi there were even laws passed to prevent greeks from taking up certain fields of work during this time greeks and other non muslim minorities , jews and armenians were sent to labor battalions . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_twenty_classes as well as the istanbul pogrom . 
  a program started by the government on the premise of a false flag attack , that was actually foiled . . but turkish media spread false information nonetheless https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/istanbul_pogrom the treaty has been broken multiple times by turkey , very shortly after it was signed , there is a reason why the greek community of turkey is completely gone despite having a population of around 150,000 , meanwhile the muslim community is still alive in thrace , and actually grew . 
  also turkey did n't `` give away '' those islands , they were taken by italy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italo-turkish_war and after ww2 were transferred to us https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_peace_with_italy,_1947 probably as a result of our contributions against italy in ww2 in the greco-italian war , and the fact they had a overwhelming greek majority . 
  i am not exactly sure , i do n't remember the reasons too well . 
  but the fact is they were not given by turkey, 
  that one guy who is trying to start a fight . . lmao this is the most slav thing i have ever seen , all it needs is some squatting, 
  looks like something you 'd find on / pol /, 
  #who 's gon na pay for the wall ? 
  that 's hilarious . 
  i mean why would they use a picture from greece for a book about spain ? 
  our cultures are not that far apart and we 've always had pretty good relations with them - traditionally we both hate turkey . 
  and we 're not the `` here 's your benefits money , please do n't hurt me '' kind of europe that ca n't deal with a few bad apples . 
  our cultures are nothing like each other expect for the food we eat , which hardly qualifies as `` culture . '', 
  your countrymen do n't want to take them because poles are the only people in europe that seem to have a brain, 
  no there are n't . 
  i do n't want greece to be a multicultural shithole , it already sucks enough as it is, 
  i rather deport them . 
  and not let them in , in the first place , why does n't poland take any ? 
   if we want them to integrate that 's cute . 
  `` intergrate '' just like all the ones in northern europe have right ? 
  we are planting the seeds for the same bullshit that happens in france and germany with this . 
   illegal immigrants the only thing illegal people are entitled to is a one way ticket the fuck out of the country, 
  as far as i know the eastern part of germany is still less developed than the west, 
   there are no good right-wing party . 
  there are plenty , see hungary ( fidesz ) switzerland ( swiss people 's party ) , austria ( fp\u00d6 ) , france ( fn ) etc, 
  donald trump is not a neo-nazi , such a retarded fucking thing to say, 
  comparing neo-nazis to the donald . 
  lol, 
  i wish we had someone like donald trump . 
  it 's like here in greece , we have no good right wing party , we have nd which is same ol' shit and shooooooosh right to golden dawn sieg heil lets all get swastika tattoos level of crazy, 
   it 's the greece government that kept postponing  kept keeps *, 
  you did n't make any reforms you fucking idiot, 
  greece is shit because greeks are shit . 
  simple mathematics shit + shit = shit . 
  shit people , shit culture , shit politicians , and shit country . 
  i 'll probably stay in germany for the rest of my life , where people are responsible , pay their taxes , care about work , and do n't destroy their country and then run around blaming imaginary enemies . 
  i 'm an architect and anything i build in greece will be turned into shit by anarchist teenagers who vandalize it anyway . 
  greeks should have an inferiority complex , greek culture is inferior to german culture, 
  i think i 'm having a stroke . 
  ok pls stop now, 
  greece is moving to the middle of the pacific fuck this shit, 
  new york pizza  italian pizza, 
  * puffs cigarette '' what the fuck did you just say you paddy leprechaun potato shit ? 
  or wait you 're italy . 
  macaroni is shit and you should feel shit . 
  i like this kinda diplomacy to be honest, 
   ehm , so why was he voted to office then ? 
  a case of `` brexiteers syndrom '' ? 
  because greek people are hurrr durr muh pension , luckily we are n't * that * stupid and polls indicate he 'll be getting btfo next election which he will probably call early, 
  fucking kill me i rather have this debt crisis than that shit, 
  bad greece wo n't start recovering until 2018 at the earliest , especially with tsipras in office, 
  you can be both tough and nice . 
  i love russian tourists for one reason . 
  one could say it is a basket of deplorables, 
  perhaps you should try logging off instead of wishing that our families were killed in genocide and pogroms . 
  and here we see the true face of our secular , progressive , turkish friends . 
  guys i think they found out about our hidden treasure !, 
  nah nobody is tougher than cretans . 
  we are ebjasnsadjkndjkasndask sorry i dropped my pistol on my keyboard maybe the maniots are as tough, 
  well no shit , they always do that . 
  no i actually love russia , i hate the bolsheviks who ruined it with shit like this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_operation_of_nkvd, 
  i hate communism . 
  where do i download `` real life '' ? 
  14 million ? 
  i always forget how much land germany lost how many germans used to live in these areas , are they still there today , did they get expelled ? 
   in all your previous victories against us , starting from your independence ( this is a big one actually , we lost our navy to france & britain ) , are you going to mention the fact that we actually defeated the turks and they needed to go to muhammad ali in egypt to quell the rebellion ? 
  you even had to bribe him with territory in cyprus , crete and morea for assistance , the greek war of independence we beat you , the revolution was only threatened when you brought your friends from egypt to help , all we did was level the playing field by bringing in ours after this decisive battle https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_dervenakia the turks had to turn to muhammad ali for help in stopping the rebellion as they were unable to do so themselves . 
  also for the balkan wars lets not forget the ottomans were an empire . 
  and greece and the other states of the balkan league for the most part was a newly formed microstates , it 's unrealistic to expect these small , new countries to be able to take on an established power like the ottomans single handily , which is why we banded together , bulgarians had the land army , greece had the navy , together we were able to defeat you , alone we would have been crushed . 
  that 's just how wars work , there are many complex factors , from equipment , to resources , etc. 
  that determine outcome , let 's not forget turks did similar , the crimean war , the russo-turkish war where britain had to stop the russian advance towards the capital , western powers also helped you after egypt beat you in the first turkish egyptian war , during the second one ... which saved you from l collapse etc https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/egyptian%e2%80%93ottoman_war_ ( 1839 % e2 % 80 % 9341 ), 
  with the new christian bale movie about the armenian genocide coming out i expect you guys to change the name soon, 
  the source that i have . 
   what kind of bullshit is this ? 
  since when indifferent eru appoints kings and lords of middle earth ? 
  you can count eru 's intervention to arda after ainulindal\u00eb with your fingers and appointing kings is not one of them . 
  legitimacy in tolkien 's universe is a different thing which , admittedly , i ca n't analyze . 
  eru appointed like ... a bunch of kings . 
  you really need to read up on your lore . . 
   we - as a nation - like to overspend and always complain about economics .
