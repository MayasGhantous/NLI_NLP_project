   or you are responsible for everyone you let in . 
  so greece has to be responsible , but the germans who rolled out the red carpet for them get a free pass to stick them all in greece . . okie dokie . 
   europe was having a renaissance while we were riding donkeys during the ottoman era were we even allowed to ride donkeys , or was it like horses and infidels were confined to travel on foot ? 
  actually you 're incorrect , greek nationalism started in the 19th century , but contemporary greek identity started to form in the late byzantine empire , as the empire shrunk and encompassed mostly `` greek '' areas . 
  this was strongest during the last byzantine dynasty , [ the palaiologos dynasty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palaiologos ) . 
  many philosophers and intellectuals such as [ gemistus pletho ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gemistus_pletho ) started to embrace the ancient identity , even referred to themselves as `` hellenes '' and there was even ideas floating around to change the title of emperor from `` emperor of the romans to `` emperor of the hellenes '' these ideas survived throughout the ottoman period , mostly in the aristocracy though in places like constantinople where you had the [ phanariotes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phanariotes ) , since the majority of the greeks in the empire were impoverished , illiterate , and just worked on the fields all day and were n't really occupied with such manners , they would pay their lords and just try to survive . 
  it 's why the greeks who would move away from greece like el greco were called el greco , literally `` the greek '' greeks have always had a sense of being greek , we just called ourselves '' \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9 '' for a while because `` greek '' was associated with dirty heathen pagans who did not have christ . 
  what western expats did was bring nationalism and the idea that greeks should have their own nation state , and they spread that idea to the general population . . and they wanted that nation state to be based on ancient greek thinking , classical liberalism , etc. 
  this actually caused rifts in society because greeks have as much in common with ancient greece as french people did with gauls , or germans with ancient germanic tribes , our culture and identity was built around orthodoxy and byzantine roman heritage , and westerners basically wanted greeks to throw away the past 2000 years of history for something they did n't really feel connected with . 
  this is why throughout modern greek history you had basically two sides of thought , one side wanted to embrace byzantine heritage and the other wanted to throw it away for a new neo-hellenism . 
  so today we kinda have a weird mix of the two , but this does n't have so much to do with `` identity '' per se , but with the ideological direction of the state , byzantine side liked the establishment of the monarchy , classicists wanted a liberal democracy , etc the reason for right wing governments is mostly as a result of the national schism and the monarchy which caused deep rifts and political instability in the country https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_schism, 
  because the middle ages was n't `` dark '' , you 're just uneducated .

  i love your comments . 
  thank you for saving us during ww2, 
  i hope my country has an election soon .

  #you are of worst german #remove schnitzel, 
  no it is n't , it 's returning to it 's pre crisis levels . 
  our country has something similar , ohi day . 
  but i was referring to op 's post not whatever poland does . 
  i think his post was meant for reflection not to celebrate the event . . 
  it 's not a celebration it 's a commemoration, 
  is your definition of expanding the union having one of the most important countries leaving it ? 
  would you say greece , portugal , italy and spain are experiencing growth ? 
  when the eu was expanding , and doing well . 
  europe was relatively stable , now that the eu is being faced with challenges it 's weaknesses are showing ... 
  the poor handling of the economic crisis , the migrant crisis , terrorism etc have shown it is not a well run institution and in need of reform . 
  eu-skepticism is rising , and people are losing faith in the union . 
  i very much would like to see the eu reform and survive but i do not see it happening . 
  you 're talking about eu expansion , meanwhile brexit is happening . 
  please . 
   conscription is state-sponsored slavery . 
  lol, 
   i 'd bet the eu will survive but greece might not . 
  we have been through worse , this economic crisis is hardly the worst thing to happen to us , it 's a small bump compared to last centuries world wars , genocide , famines , civil wars , military dictatorships , and occupations . 
  yes . 
   fore instance that the greenland should be offered a decent fishery policy before it left so it could have stayed without the risk of destroying it main industry . 
  eu legislation and attitudes should be liberal and limited if we want the eu to survive . 
  for that to happen we need an attitude change amongst the voters . 
  the main goal of the eu is a superstate , if the globalist ca n't have a superstate they do n't care much for the eu eu is already failing . 
  economic woes , rising anti-eu sentiment across the continent , one of the largest and most important members on their way out the door , and there seems to be little interest by eurocrats to reform . 
  the union will not survive the next decade . 
  the feel when you 're not switzerland,

  erdogan is a crypto-greek, 
  wait ... so you are saying we should * help * turks ? 
  i 've seen it argued that they actually benefited from ww2 in the end , destroying a lot of their competition , the british empire , etc, 
   it 's just that be definition , if i live differently that you do , i am considered `` diverse '' and thus a threat to the proud national identity . 
  if your definition of `` living as you see fit '' entails having to swarm our country with migrants , than you should reevaluate your life, 
   awesome , you made your proud stand against the forces of evil and your patriotic morale can soar high once again . 
  you sound like a moron . 
   also i would simply recommend to not view things from a majority/minority perspective . 
  i know that being a majority is intoxicating , like you think you can finally enforce your `` ethnic identity '' on people like me , but remember that mob rule is a very dangerous thing and has historically bitten you in the ass , so eventually it will turn against you as well . 
  nobody is enforcing any identity on you , we are just trying to protect our own . 
  from ex-communist states , mostly albania , as well as the mena it 's not just immigrant groups either , you have roma for instance, 
  nowhere in my comment did i say `` diversity '' caused our financial crisis . 
  nor is my personal resentment towards `` diversity '' tied to the financial crisis . 
  even if greece was the wealthiest nation on earth i would still be against `` diversity '' , people like you might be okay with losing the ethnic identity of our country , but me and evidently the majority of greeks are not . 
  if germany can not control europe through peaceful ways it will seek to do it through war, 
  so we should take even more problems ? 
  for example immigrants commit half of the crimes in greece https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crime_in_greece#immigrant_crime this is the kind of stuff immigrants bring to greece https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_paros_beating_and_rape greece has enough problems as it is . 
  seeing greece 's numbers gives me hope . 
  i hope we start to see it even less positively, 
  you realize germany has gone bankrupt and defaulted more times than greece ? 
  no greece ? 
  i heard british people are pretty friendly towards greek immigrants from friends there , i also visited an had a great time , actually i do n't know anywhere in europe where people have a problem with us , the only racism i encounter is bad pay debts jokes, 
  i guess the poles should be thankful to the soviets since they did n't kill as many of them as the nazis did . 
  yes it does . 
  can germany go a century without dividing europe ? 
  we must never forget of the suffering of those poor imperialistic ottoman muslim overlords who were killed by their 2nd class subjects after subjugating and oppressing them for 400 years . 
  rip in peace . 
   yes !, 
  people who tried to genocide their neighbors should solve their issues with their neighbors . 
  you have a lot of issues to solve then . 
  is there an ethnic group in the region that you did n't genocide ? 
  off .

   we would n't have to deal with any of this shit if he could just resign , i agree , once assad resigns , there will be no power vacuum at all and the conflict will end , all of the rebel groups , etc involved will lay down their weapons and everyone will hold hands and sing wonderful songs and syria will become a successful democracy,
