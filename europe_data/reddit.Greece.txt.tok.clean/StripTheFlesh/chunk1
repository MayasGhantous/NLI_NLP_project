i do n't understand why these guys are so judgmental of politicians ' pronunciations . 
  it 's a different language from a different family . 
  do we want our politicians to spend hundreds of hours trying to improve how they appear or develop skills that are more related to running the country . 
  ah thank you . 
  yeah , but to be honest we were never exactly cool with immigrants before the crisis . 
  i mean you blued 100 % more cyprus , 
  in terms of culture and tradition they share lots of stuff with us ( and maybe with some of the balkans too ? ), 
  you are cheating , that 's 100 % more european cyprus, 
  define `` world '', 
  they are more cooked than my grandma 's marmalade . 
  well , they could make the same map for blond neo-nazis that eat more than 1800 calories per day , the results would probably be the same . 
  maybe meaningless is not the correct word but the map is at least misleading , some people on other comments said that it probably has to do with conservative vs liberal countries . 
  [ wtf ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_life_expectancy ) 10 years difference . 
  how come ? 
  / r/forwardsfromeurope, 
  we volunteer for lovers : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkmcoxe4br4, 
  can you explain ? 
   the most difficult part was about to come then : the last 7 km , from the rhine river to the research center , the spectrometer had to move across the narrow streets of some german locations http://www.fogonazos.es/2008/05/how-to-move-200-ton-spectrometer-across.html, 
  what 's wrong with your flair ? 
  why do you want to leave ? 
  we are winning !, 
  not really . 
  there is . 
  this guy got his stats tottally wrong . 
  golden dawn ( neonazis ) is up to 9.49 % from 5.87 % while syriza is down . 
  source : official results http://ekloges.ypes.gr/current/v/public/index.html?lang=en# { `` cls '' : `` level '' , `` params '' :{ `` level '' : `` dhm '' , `` id '' :9284 } }, 
  current results ( 46.56 % reporting ) : http://ekloges.ypes.gr/current/v/public/index.html?lang=en# { `` cls '' : `` level '' , `` params '' :{ `` level '' : `` dhm '' , `` id '' :9284 } } what are you talking about ? 
  syriza is down from 38.84 % to 37.46 % and golden dawn is up to 9.49 % from 5.87 %, 
  well , if syriza does n't form a goverment , nd ca n't form one without kke , golden dawn and syriza, 
  yeah but greek priests also like to bless things . 
  a separate map of europe + mediterranean would have been helpful, 
  how would they know where they came from and why would the origin country accept to take them back ? 
   ask instead : do you dislike people from your country that practice judaism or are from have jewish ascendance ? 
  the way the percentages were calculated is n't just `` do you dislike jews '' or something and only one of them is related to israel ( `` jews are more loyal to israel than to [ this country/to the countries they live in ] '' ) . 
  antisemitism is defined as :  antisemitism ( also spelled anti-semitism or anti-semitism ) is prejudice against , hatred of , or discrimination against jews as an ethnic , religious , or racial group . 
  a person who holds such positions is called an antisemite . 
  antisemitism is widely considered to be a form of racism . 
  and jews :  the jews , also known as the jewish people , are an ethnoreligious and ethno-cultural group descended from the israelites of the ancient near east and originating from the historical kingdoms of israel and judah . 
  http://global100.adl.org/about  before answering the index questions , survey respondents were read the following statement : `` i am now going to read out a series of statements , some of them you may think are true and some of them you may think are false . 
  please say which ones you think are probably true and which ones you think are probably false . '', 
  as with previous public opinion research conducted by adl in the united states , survey respondents who said at least 6 out of the 11 statements are `` probably true '' are considered to harbor anti-semitic attitudes . 
  the index score for each country represents the percentage of adults in that specific country who answered `` probably true '' to a majority of the anti-semitic stereotypes tested.the following are the eleven statements that constitute the adl global 100 anti-semitism index : 1 jews are more loyal to israel than to [ this country/the countries they live in ] * 2 jews have too much power in international financial markets 3 jews have too much control over global affairs 4 jews think they are better than other people 5 jews have too much control over the global media 6 jews are responsible for most of the world 's wars 7 jews have too much power in the business world 8 jews do n't care what happens to anyone but their own kind 9 people hate jews because of the way jews behave 10 jews have too much control over the united states government 11 jews still talk too much about what happened to them in the holocaust, 
  and it 's so easy !, 
  it only takes some money !, 
  yep . 
  let 's target the religion of those that destabilized middle east . 
  yeah but i want actual links . 
  i want a mainstream western feminist organisation with such a statement . 
  i am emphasizing on his use of `` widely '' of course there are going to be some nay-sayers . 
  there is a whole feminist organisation with action in 170 countries but his view is :  unfortunately for brestfeeding , educated , wealthy , white women breastfeed more . 
  this proved to be the death sentence for the breastfeeding movement in feminism . 
  eh where did you get your view on feminism , tumblr ? 
  because most movements over here deal with rapes , trafficking and violence against women . 
  also , there is some activity against homophobia but could n't find anything about transgender acceptance ( what 's wrong with fighting against transphobia anyway ? ), 
   2 ) this shows how little you know . 
  look it up . 
  breastfeeding is widely considered `` problematic '' . 
  http://www.waba.org.my/resources/activitysheet/acsh4.htm first google result . 
  femen has activity in france and in 2013 only 2 out of 30 activists were ukrainian . 
  also , can you link some evidence of said `` hate '' by mainstream western feminists ? 
  they do n't actually list any , ~ ~ ca n't ~ ~ can someone find something ? 
  so now femen is not a western feminist movement ? 
  but dude this guy is tolerant as fuck , he learned his values from ayn rand, 
  yeah i know that , did n't mean to say otherwise but i am just saying that many subscribers of / r/europe live in a country where it the fyrom name is used or that everyone 's beloved un , eu and nato still uses that name so it 's not like greece is the only one still using it like the top level comment makes it to be . 
  i see . 
  when i said the `` opposite '' i meant that greek gov did actually react ( that 's what i understand from the wiki article ) . 
  that said , `` gre '' is not greece 's iso code . 
  wait , maybe i misunderstood your comment is it a ) tito names macedonia and greek gov says `` eww no '' or b ) tito names macedonia and greek gov says `` lol do n't care '' ? 
  there is a very minor fuzz . 
  nothing changed the past years related to the dispute . 
  most right-wing , nationalistic etc groups are ready to be offended whenever they hear the word `` macedonia '' and most leftist groups do n't care that much . 
  keep in mind that people also do n't use the name `` macedonia '' regardless of their views on the dispute because it would not be clear if they meant the greek region or the country . 
  source ? 
  because i only found about the opposite . 
  what does the choice of a private news station to block a name have anything to do with the economic problems ? 
  it 's not like this was an action done by our government or a minister . 
   everyone calls them macedonia , just move the f *** on ... imf , nato , eu , un , germany , australia , france , spain do not . 
  it already has the white power celtic cross on it . 
  yeah i think they are a recent trend in thessaloniki , here are some more pictures : http://pswnio.gr/archives/14356, 
  yeah and it looks really compelling irl too because it 's a tall building compared too it 's surroundings . 
  they are not going to find peace in greece . 
  they will be unemployed , they do n't know the language and they ca n't learn it that easily , 5 % of our population are neo-nazis and they are already treated badly by the police . 
  if you wan na hear it : https://translate.google.com/#el/en/%cf%80%ce%bb%ce%b1%cf%84%cf%85%cf%80%ce%bf%ce%b4%ce%b1%cf%82, 
  it 's not like they never thought about it , they just did n't implement it . 
  skype does it . 
  yep . 
  i think that they 'd prefer a coalition government with syriza-pasok-nd-anel ( ? ) - potami ( ? ), 
  but no elections . 
  i 've heard related stuff in greek media today . 
  hollande too, 
   if i was wrong to detect sarcasm in your statement , my apologies . 
  while i disagree with said parties ( 2 of them are responsible for the current economic situation in greece , they are corrupt and useless ) , i did n't say that sarcastically , i just believe that it is a fact, 
  passing it through the parliament is a walk in the park . 
  the thing is that syriza is likely to collapse from the inside considering the abstains and negative votes in the last parliament vote . 
  pasok , nd and potami will vote anything . 
  i do n't ~ ~ now ~ ~ know what will happen inside the current government though . 
  i can see multiple loses from syriza party members that abstained from the previous parliament vote . 
  not saying that you are wrong or not but is this adjusted for inflation ? 
  yeah , if you ignore the whole grefendum thing .
