  i knew it , i should n't have bought all these fins but i was such a bad swimmer . 
  now greece is poor . 
  what 's so weird about it ? 
  i personally believe that our older governments lead us to this shit but i still do n't think that the troika is improving the situation . 
  tsakalotos is apparently a paok fan . 
  [ hear it ] ( https://youtu.be/du0fceaqgc0?t=34s ) translation :  `` ohhh paok - ** \u03ac\u03c1\u03b1 ** i 've got madness , inside my mind wherever you 'll play i 'm always following you for you i 'll die and only you is why i live the image is a wordplay referring to this song . 
  to make some sense keep in mind that there is a suffix '' - \u03ac\u03c1\u03b1 '' that `` enhances '' the meaning of a word . 
  so , if you say '' \u03b3\u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1 '' ( = good looking woman ) you can also say '' \u03b3\u03ba\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1 '' ( = great looking woman ) or '' \u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03c3\u03b1 '' ( = penis ) and '' \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03c3\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1 '' ( = big penis ) . 
  you can pretty much add it to all feminine words ( or any word and femininize it , dunno i got confused ) . 
  so , the translation of the image is :  ohhh eurogroup - ** \u03ac\u03c1\u03b1 ** i 've got proposals in my mind . 
  like the other comment said , not super funny , i just used it for the image, 
  wow talking about hyperbolic . 
  you know that illegal ! = 10 years gulag right ? 
  anyway , i think that it is illegal to buy a product and not have a receipt for it , because black market and stuff exist . 
  for example , i ca n't believe that buying a stolen bicycle from the main square in eindhoven would bare zero consequence for me if i got caught . 
  lol , asking tourists to obey the country 's law . 
  i would n't be surprised if there was a correlation between tax evasers and people who overcharge you because you do n't get to see a receipt . 
  i almost always get a receipt as a local , the thing is that tax evasion is higher when you are a tourist . 
  i remember not getting on some occations receipts in spain , bulgaria , poland , netherlands , germany , italy , czech republic, 
  i understand not wanting to implement ceau\u0219escu 's type of austerity but this is totally different and your reply was uncalled for . 
   everyone of my clients gave them back to me and say `` i do n't want it take it out of my sight '' said no client in the history of ever . 
  worst case scenario is that you put it in your pocket and throw it or just leave it on the table . 
  from my understanding , the one is rejecting a new deal and the other one is breaking an old one . 
  not exactly that but there are some posts that openly say `` i have no sympathy for the greek people '' or `` whatever happens to them , they deserve it '' . 
  / r/europe does n't contain many of them though compared to the rest of reddit and the right-wing leaning subreddits ( eg / r/worldnews ) . 
  [ case in point ] ( http://cdn1.24live.co/images/2015/07/06/1436124433321703.jpg ), 
  + huge percent of `` no '' voters are from the huge number of unemployed people . 
  chaos was kinda inevitable though ? 
  greek people did n't vote for syriza to accept any deal . 
  if they just said `` oh ok we are gon na accept this deal but just once because it is the summer and we need more tourists '' there would have been multiple protests and civil unrest . 
  anyway , syriza and it 's voters believe that the austerity policies continuously hurt the country 's economy . 
  since troika does n't feel like changing their stance on them syriza ca n't push to the other direction like they promised without causing some chaos . 
  bookings reduction for 2-3 weeks is a temporary problem anyway , nothing happens these days that is going to hurt tourism in the long run . 
  that 's not how anything works . 
  modern greece was historically homophobic , this is the first time i 've seen a pro-gay gallop concerning us, 
  yes it is . 
  compared to areas that face war daily some frequent terrorist attacks are nothing . 
  just tell her that she can have her face on euros too, 
  1705 average income ? 
  yeah but the overall score is the % of who answered positively to a majority of these questions . 
  for example [ sweden ] ( http://global100.adl.org/#country/sweden ) scored 4 % but all the answers minus one are above 5 % edit : also you can select `` attitude toward religious groups '' from `` choose a subject '' and see that 34 % have an unfavorable opinion for the jews and 24 % ca n't rate . 
  for example , russia scores 17 % unfavorable 8 % ca n't rate, 
   sgouridis did not address how his claim squared with the fact that more jews were killed in a single day during the holocaust than all israeli and palestinian casualties in gaza 's wars combined wow , this was extremely shitty . 
  lets just invade instabul then ? 
  we are gon na keep the death count lower than greek genocide so this excuses our actions right ? 
  more stats about greece : http://global100.adl.org/#country/greece, 
  but he did n't state any facts relating to the current situation . 
  yes , historically we saved lots of jews during ww2 but is this the current situation ? 
  i mean , the main resistance force during ww2 was extremely communistic and left-wing , would this be the same situation today ? 
  societies change,

  how does everyone already know it if the top level comment says they are scandies ? 
  wow , this is as stupid as it gets , thanks for the explanation . 
  probably you are tired because of all the starvation, 
  in greek google writing greek : * a wedding * a gold sovereign * one kwh * a pound in greek google writing greek but with latin characters ( [ greeklish ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greeklish ) ) : * kteo ( vehicle inspection ) * a wedding * one kwh * abortion, 
  well , we eat a shit tone of food after easter so noone complains . 
  i would n't even be surprised if most of the right-wing population of greece blames the government for the situation . 
  now i want to use ' ' sometime in my life . 
  [ example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp6piv2wjrk ), 
  yep we should be only focusing in fixing our economy . 
  i am sure that technology , innovations or succesful products have nothing to do with it . 
  and if the question was about defensive fighting there is nothing wrong with that . 
  you got markdowned . 
  your 4 appears as a 3 . 
  well , it still says faster than 99 % of romania . 
  from what i understand it is related about the culture you export that ends up helping the rest of the world , not just your nation . 
  also , it 's pretty unfair to put greece high in the culture ranking because of our history . 
  it 's an index about what a country is doing currently to help make the world a better place . 
  greece does n't produce lots of art , theatre , film , architecture and television and it 's music scene is targeted only for greeks . 
  nothing wrong with that thought , just trying to understand their thinking . 
  i mean why would you name it `` ox pass '' in the first place ? 
  lol turks get gud . 
  guns drugs and pasok, 
  i honestly just copied & pasted because i was looking for another index and then i saw your comment . 
  but since you asked : yeah it probably is . 
  but it 's hard to create an index for `` culture '' because it 's a vague term and generally not countable . 
  from a quick look at their website they try to promote solving problems on a global scale and nations collaborating instead of competing against each other . 
  they probably adjusted the definition of culture to fit their purpose . 
  because evolution is known to have an effect in some 100s of years . 
   contributions to culture   6 .

  either ? 
  we are not going to ask for half an island for eight people . 
  that 's crazy . 
  will do . 
  suck it germany, 
  we can help if you want . 
  like good old times . 
  actually whenever gypsies are mentioned this things are said .
