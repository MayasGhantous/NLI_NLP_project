yeap , most academics would agree - macedonia is coloured red on that map . 
  ^ ^ this guy knows what he 's talking about, 
   and tsipras is right . 
  greece will need bailouts well into the future the experts , that nobody wants to hear from , have been warning about this for years . 
  that is something very well-known , so it 's really shocking to hear that same warning repeated in 2016 , from the one person that could have done something about it last year , but chickened out . 
  everybody 's tired of listening to what needs to be done . 
  he should either get a firm commitment about the debt , or get us out of ez/eu or whatever and do what needs to be done . 
  we had a referendum , we told him not to sign another bailout deal , yet here we are again repeating the same mistakes . 
  stop kicking the can down the road !, 
  yeah , whatever ... ( \u2323 _ \u2323 '' ) at least i got a better view of that huge playmobil, 
  thanks for that . 
  i was really surprised why more people would choose greece over italy , but yeah , 10 years ago ... 
  yes , that 's the number i 've been told , something in the order of $ 50/month . 
  now imagine if you were paying $ 1000-1500 per month for 30-40 years with the promise that when you got old you would at least get a nice pension . 
  then , when that time came , some asshole told you that they lost your money and you 'll just get $ 600 , that does n't buy shit in greece . 
  i think in that case a little bit of complaining , at the least , is justified . 
  so how much do you pay monthly until you get that $ 200 pension ? 
  and it could be better . 
  when grexit comes , our nhs will have an additional 350 million drachma per week to spend - something to keep in mind in the next referendum . 
  * `` what are you ? '', 
  * `` i 'm batman . '', 
  well , actually it 's us , athenians - we move our companies to sofia to avoid paying taxes in greece . 
  we take lots of pictures too !, 
   it 's not like the mou was a giant program to transfer greek wealth to germany that 's not what i was referring to , but since you mentioned it , here it is : * devaluing the euro , benefiting german exports ? 
  check . 
  * scaring investors off the euro periphery , pushing german bond yields to record lows ? 
  check . 
  * impoverishing a country , giving german economy an inflow of cheap educated immigrants ? 
  check . 
  * forcing the greek government to sell state property for peanuts to german companies ? 
  check . 
  thirsty for more ? 
  when i was younger we were conditioned to think that if one eu country performs well , that benefits us all . 
  it was the eu vs the rest of the world . 
  we stopped protecting the local industry , and allowed them to shut down , in the name of further european integration . 
  after all we should n't be competing with each other - it was the rest of the world we should be worrying about , right ? 
  when the ** global ** economic crisis started , the periphery absorbed the biggest hit . 
  as a result , some countries did n't even feel a thing . 
  then , to what has to be the biggest dick move ever , germany decided it was time to keep their profits , and take a step back . 
  as far as greece goes , there 's currently nothing produced here - we kind of have to buy stuff from you . 
  your large surpluses are our large deficits . 
  your record employment is our record unemployment . 
  so , yeah , enjoy our money and keep telling to yourself it 's your nation 's virtues that brought it all . 
   held a pistol to their head , not because they believed in it when someone is holding a pistol to your head and asks you to jump off the cliff , the reason you jump is the pistol . 
  only a masochistic psychopath would demand that the victim also `` believe in it '' while falling into the empty space . 
  i hope you guys get over the crazy phase soon . 
  enjoy our money , btw . 
  i 'm just commenting on the fact that varoufakis has always been a big proponent of the eu and never suggested that greece should leave the ez . 
  that 's it . 
  whether his ideas would work or not , well , that 's debatable and it was not my intention to start an argument on that . 
   i doubt that he actually believed that this was a good idea for greece you doubt ? 
  there 's nothing to guess here . 
  in two separate occasions in 2011 he presented our former finmin his plan , in which , greece would leave the ez ( voluntarily ) and germany would provide a couple of billions in humanitarian aid ( maybe airdrop un wheat flour sacks ) . 
  a couple of days ago , varoufakis described sch\u00e4uble 's obsession with grexit as , and i quote , `` life purpose '' . 
  and it 's not that he 's trying to hide it . 
  everybody 's seen how demeaning and offensive he is when talking about greece and the greeks . 
  he once joked about swapping greece with [ puerto rico ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-09/schaeuble-jokes-he-offered-lew-greece-for-puerto-rico ) . 
  like we greeks belong to you to do with as you wish !, 
  * oh , greeks hate us for no reason at all . 
  all we do is being nice to them . 
  hey , that 's excellent . 
  exercising can also help reduce urges to smoke . 
  i was lucky enough to have a treadmill at home . 
  been smoke free for 4 years . 
   it makes the varoufakis idea , or any idea of leaving the eurozone , completely idiotic no , that 's not accurate . 
  varoufakis was pushing for a solution * within * the eurozone . 
  the one consistently pushing for a solution where greece `` voluntarily '' leaves the ez is sch\u00e4uble . 
  the negative opinions about germany make sense , but positive opinions about greece ? 
  best proof that they were not polling greeks . 
  man , this ~ ~ sucks ~ ~ socks . 
   a significant part of the population decides to retire at 50 before the law kicks in what i do n't understand is that since you 're pulling numbers out of your ass , why not go with 30 or 20 , to provoke even more ? 
  clearly you 're missing an opportunity here . 
  yeah , but since erdogan is blocking access to the internet , they now have to do it the old fashioned way . 
   a ** nation ** of tax dodgers and corrupt politicians , which even now tries its hardest to not reform shamelessly spreading ** lies ** out of hatred . 
  people like you are disgusting . 
  you know that ? 
  hope that eu starts deporting idiots like you , then maybe we can start living in peace in this continent . 
   should be paying up even more for greek fuck ups why not ? 
  we did pay for german fuck ups , after all , especially your meddling in our affairs during the last 6 years . 
  maybe separate our fuck ups , so that everyone pays for their own fuck ups as sovereign independent countries ? 
  fuck all of you , [ we ] ( http://canada.greekreporter.com/2012/04/21/researcher-claims-ancient-greeks-made-it-to-america-before-columbus/ ) were there first . 
  i hate to burst your bubble , but the greek civilization predates anything remotely related to the turks by a few millennia . 
  we were living in what you call turkey today long before you arrived and the only turks that are europeans are the ones with greek ancestors . 
  i wonder , how many of you are you willing to admit that you are greek ? 
   discriminating and throwing ~ ~ 83 ~ ~ 10 million ~ ~ germans ~ ~ greeks into a pot of a few corrupt karma is a bitch , is n't it ? 
   far below what greece would have gotten on the open market and if that 's not real friendship , i do n't know what is . 
   luckily we have the economic leverage to force them to enact halfway decent policies thank you - what would we do without you !, 
  dude , you call us `` yunan '' , which is the name of the greek tribe ( [ ionians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ionia ) ) that used to live where you currently live . 
  go get yourself a book . 
  yes , if you had never migrated from mongolia and what you call `` turkey '' today was still home to the greeks that used to live there , then yes , you 're right , byzantium would be in the eu . 
   6 - ma qi dun oh , come on chinese , are you kidding us ?!, 
  it 's `` f yug ma qi dun '' damnit, 
  i personally would have no objections to czecho-pseudo-macedonia . 
  my rule of the thumb : you add `` czecho - '' in front of the country name and if it sounds familiar , then it 's the country to the east , otherwise it 's the country to the west . 
  the law of the sea that you cite , gives greece ( and everybody else ) the right to claim 12nm of territorial sea ( and of course 12nm of airspace ) . 
  the reason that greece decided to remain at 6nm is that your parliament has voted a law that says that the second we claim our 12nm you 'll declare war on us . 
  and that 's why you do n't belong in europe . 
  the reason we claim just 10nm of airspace is a compromise we took between maintaining peace and properly protecting our country against an aggressive neighbor . 
  * you 'll be back ( to the eu ) . 
  wow , that sure backfired , did n't it ?
