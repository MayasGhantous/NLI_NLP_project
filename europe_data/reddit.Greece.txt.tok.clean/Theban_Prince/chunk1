greece is exactly like that , or even worse . 
  thats . . thats not expensive at all . 
  i think you just dont have the `` cafe culture '' . 
   it 's much cheaper to just make it at home . 
  drinking the coffee is not the main point of these gatherings . 
  shareholders have extreme powers . 
  what happen if they decide to liquidate the company for short gain when yu where in for the long shot ? 
  what happen of the majority decides into an action that end with the destruction of the company ? 
  as for free will , you can always leave the country if you are not happy with it , just like a company . 
  i did it and i found one that better suit me and i am extremely happy about it . 
  but surely not always the vote reluts will be unanimous . 
  by your definitions , the majority is extorting the minority . 
  and the public does discuss and debate policies , morals and ideas . 
  heck we are doing it right now !, 
  i used the terms you used but yes shareholders either take decisions directly or select a representative . 
  how do they reach a consensus ? 
  so the shareholders vote for decisions or the people vote for the ceo right ? 
   private companies operate however they want to . 
  true , but how do they reach those decisions ? 
  hmmm i see you are `` anarcho-liberal '' . 
  question , how would private companies operate ? 
  will they still have a board that votes ? 
  last time i checked , every citizen can voice his opinion about taxes in the voting booths . 
  so far they seem to agree that taxes are okay . 
  so no force . 
  even those two have enough land for a friggin kids camp . 
  yeah and its was crossposted there . 
  it was fucking hilarious . 
  you pronounce half parts of your words , expect when you do n't . 
  a lot of verbs sound the same in 4 out of 6 pronouns . 
  a lot of words sound the same in singular and plural . 
  get out of here !, 
  i dont know about tittinutus , but bewetting sounds like a psychological problem so yeah . 
  there are also `` ranks '' based on your status , with i1 being full able bodied soldier that ate going to get armed , i2-i4 means they van serve but with lesser respomcibilities and/or unarmed due for example to health problems , and i5 means total exempt , isually for psychological issues . 
  think is a lot of people abuse the i5 on the expense of others then go all philosophical about it trying to whitewash their corruption . 
  * greek commentators ignoring the central aspect of your argument and attack random tidbits , , like your formatting , derailing the entire thread . 
  been quite a bit that i have unsubbed , but r/greece : * making fun of a couple of libertarian americans that wanted to connect with their heritage , only to spew political nonsense that may make sense for the us but it utter ridiculous for greeks . 
  no syriza is not like us democrats nor its communist . 
  * greek bona fide communists that their arguments make as sense as the american libertarians . 
  get ridiculed as well . 
  * slapfights if it was greece 's fault or europe 's that the country is in a semi-destroyed state . 
  its only one or the other for some people , its inconceivable that maybe both parties fucked up royally . 
  it leads to third party commentators inserting jokes/trolling because everyone is tired.by now . 
  * tourists asking for weed . 
  * people asking for ways to cheat their way out of the obligation to serve the military . 
  paging u/gschizas for verification !, 
  good `` national '' food . 
  ao far i have tried chech , english and belgian cuisine and i am sorry but they are simply leagues behind the greek cuisine . 
  except the obvious , the [ national anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vkpru6c-jq ) , a lot of songs from the wwii era and the greco-italian war where contemporary hits and they are still considered patriotic without being affiliated with any political view . 
  the most famous are from a one specific singer , sophia vembo : [ sons of greece ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koezupeh-l4 ) the [ duce ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duce ) puts [ on his uniform ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upwigvjhpio ) [ the song of freedom ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkeqetfwli ) another famous song was from nikos gounaris '' [ mussolini you are a sucker ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bryigrhahkw ) '' . 
  needless to say , the song 's lyrics are not very nice towards the italians and their leadership  there is a slew of waltzes , military marches and guerrilla songs , but unfortunately they have been tainted by getting coopted from one group or another or originating from a controversial part of our history ( and they have been many ) , so they cant be really called `` patriotic '' in the neutral form of the word . 
  which on is it ? 
  for the love of me i cant remember any saying with a goat . 
  oh i nothing so serious as being butthurt , i am just having fun at your expense !, 
  oh look i did it again !, 
   the louisiana education system hires belgians and french people to teach immersion classes where everything is in french for the little ones . 
  god i can imagine the fights between them when they reach the point where they teach the young ` uns about counting . .

  u/vladraptor look !, 
  a live example in the wild !, 
  after the us civil war , many from the south claimed that the war did n't happen because of slavery but to defend the rights of states , and the north caused the war to curb those ( these people will often use the `` war of northern aggression '' term ) . 
  of course that 's bullshit , because slavery was repeatedly mentioned as the reason , including the official secession declarations of most of the rebel states . 
  however , the central us government , in the process of reconciling the nation after the war , did n't do much to stop this whitewashing , also known as the `` lost cause '' . 
  as a result certain icons of the war continued to be used , including the confederate flag in official state buildings of the south , `` because it is part of our history and heritage and has nothing to do with how we almost got away with creating a nigger slave nation , we promise ! '' . 
  after the [ charleston church shooting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charleston_church_shooting ) , it was discovered that the white supremacist guy that did that ( unsurprisingly ) adored the confederate flag , sparking a much needed debate on what the hell an icon of slave holding rebels is doing a top of state buildings and monuments , and some states started taking them down . 
  of course this caused some right wing pricks that had been using the flag in their cars , lawns and underwear as a way to flung their ~ ~ white ~ ~ state pride around to go berserk about `` political correctness gone mad '' `` the government is stepping on our rights '' `` the war was about states rights not slavery ! '', 
  white genocide '' and other such poppycock . 
  so we can infer that the guy with the sticker op mentioned is part of those groups . 
  i heard a story the turks had about greeks that is dated way back to the ottoman empire , that will answer you question : one day allah took the best ingredients in the world , mixed them , and made the turk , then placed him in a big frying pan to live . 
  the turk was a good , decent , and a hardworking man , but he was naive . 
  allah , to make him better , took the worst parts he could find , and made the greek and placed him inside the same pan . 
  the greek was disinterested in hard work , but he was also adventurous , mischievious , and imaginitive . 
  as a result , he run circles around the naive turk , outmaneuvering and tricking him in every opportunity . 
  the turk had such a bad time in the pan , and was losing so much ground , that he cried for help to allah to do something about it . 
  so allah , in his eternal wisdom , took the greek and split him in two . 
  from then on , the turk was safe , because the two greeks wasted their time always fighting and using their cunning against each other instead of him . 
  yet . 
  i would like to see what happens if the brussels question is ever solved and flanders not only gains independence , but actually pushes for merging with the netherlands . 
  hmm it seems like place names like `` brabant '' are not that meaningless as you claim to be . 
  from what i have read , it was supposed to be temporary after fyrom backtracked a lot , and was the reason the greek embargo was lifted and bilateral relations started in mid 90s . 
  then i am guessing [ vmro-dpmne ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vmro-dpmne ) was elected in '98 and here we are . 
  last time i checked for * one * example , macedonia-us relations are at all time high . 
  i can see some backroom pressure applied from the us to greece for whatever reason , or * else * . 
  and we are not talking in `` next monday '' time scales here , but years or decades down the road . 
  russia , the us , european powers , for whatever reason that can be applicable now or in the future . 
   `` izlezi momce pravo na terasa '' what is the translation ? 
   so the mofa removed estimates about macedonians living in greece and bulgaria . 
  what is your position these days , do you still deny their existence and rights ? 
  maybe it has something to do with your government claiming that they are more than 700000 in greece , while independent observers claim they are about 30000 ? 
  yeah because great powers do n't have the tendency to break up nations or creating `` autonomous zones '' for `` saving the minorities '' especially in the balkans . 
  i am saying that i do n't expect fyrom to invade thessaloniki tomorrow . 
  but leaving this things open can come back and bite you in the ass , particularly if a bigger power wishes to pressure greece to comply for any reason , or even face the possibility of diplomatic `` grey zones '' being created , meaning disputed areas where they where none ( greece has already situations like this with cyprus and the aegean ) similar to ossetia , crimea or kosovo , so in this case , the `` no step back '' greek stance , especially since this things can end effect situations for 10 , 20 , or even 50 years ahead , is prudent in my opinions , even if they sound `` silly '' to uninformed persons . 
  this * is * the balkans after all . 
  officially fyrom , always abbreviated , to be given emphasis on the `` former yugoslavic '' part . 
  does n't make any sense either way , i know . 
  in everyday life its called `` skopje '' .
