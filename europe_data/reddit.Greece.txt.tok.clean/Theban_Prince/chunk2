  would you be so kind to translate the song all these people sing in some pretty official functions ? 
  http://www.euractiv.com/section/enlargement/news/macedonia-erases-irredentist-claims-as-commission-tables-report/ fyrom foreign ministry having clearly irredentist claims on its official website , that is force to bury . 
  are those enough for you ? 
  stop the troll levels [ propaganda ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/14/alexander-great-macedonia-warrior-horse ) [ moves ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skopje_%22alexander_the_great%22_airport ) that are both for internal and external consumption and i am game . 
   it 's stupid to think that fyrom will claim any of our terrains , how would they ? 
  i do n't know , why we do n't ask kosovo ? 
  or crimea ? 
  or ossetia ? 
  why not both ? 
  the name is simply one part of the problem that is about * '' . . them trying to steal history , historical figures and lay claims on greek lands '' * . 
  people get all riled up because they think greece is opposed someone else using the word `` macedonia '' just cause . 
  its not . 
  its about building a fake nationalistic image , that then is used for claims about `` oppressed minorities '' '' [ unliberated macedonia ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/ethnicmacedonia.jpg ) '' etc in greece . 
  [ asylum productions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_asylum ) on a country level . 
  greece consider the name and history appropiation part of irredentist claims . 
  so it will block the ascension since it will be seem as legimising those claims . 
  i will not bother to explain why this is the case , because it goes against the common narrative , it only leads to arguments whithout any point . 
  it is what it is . 
  well we blocked their nato membership , and still blocking after * 26 * years . 
  any politician that takes a step back will commit political suicide , and things have getting worse in that aspect , not better . 
  so you ignorance is telling again friend . 
  the constitution is about as vague ad it can get , and it definetely doesnt fix the name and history appropiation that probably are not done just for laughs . 
  at whitch point did i behaved in a ( apparent ) kind way while feeling superior ? 
  you asked a question , i gave you an answer , you didnt like , and you just dismissed any argument by making childish analogies , which kinda betrayed your ( somewhat understandable ) ignorance on the subject . 
  fyrom is not getting to eu with this name as long as greece has veto . 
  i am not going to educate you through reddit banter , and * maybe * you should not make opinions before studying it up a bit . 
  you mean a change in the constitution that can changed back or simply get sidesteped ? 
  words in a paper do n't matter much as long as actions do n't back them up . 
  that change happened to lower the heat after greece had applied a full on embargo to fyrom ... and then promptly forgotten when the embargo was lifted . 
   patronize 1 . treat with an apparent kindness which betrays a feeling of superiority . 
  i do n't think you know what patronizing means . 
  last time i checked , they are n't a member state . 
  nor anytime soon . 
  so we only start worry about nationalistic claims until they actually attack . 
  got it . 
   it has , yes , but why would anyone interfere in this ? 
  and if they did , who even support the macedonian claims ? 
  now maybe not , but these kidns fo things tend to stick around for a long long time . 
   aaand ? 
  the current liberal government of denmark promised a lot of things they did n't do . 
  that is just a part of politics . 
  the same did the social-democrats last time , and the liberals before the social-democrats , etc. 
  this is literally a non answer . 
  it doent matter if government do what they say , when people vote for it . 
  we just * hope * that all the governments that get elected are not going to act on their promises ? 
   oh come on . 
  there are statues of ancient greek and roman kings and emperors in denmark . 
  you are blowing it out of proportions . 
  it is just a name , is n't it ? 
  what makes the name special ? 
  does denmark claim that these statues where originally built by ancient danish that lived in athens , and that even now an oppressed majority of danish live in greece ? 
  because if they did , there would * also * be a problem . 
  in belgium , while n-va and vlaams belang are officially for full independence , there a lot of voices that support reunification of flanders with the netherlands . 
  preatty weak considering the present government , which has made numerous nationalistic and irredentist claims have risen to power since 1998 . 
   is macedonia in any way a danger to greece ? 
  so why does it matter ? 
  why do you assume this is the case ? 
  balkans have been notorious for greater powers interfering between two nations . 
   then it should be noted that it probably is n't what won them the election . 
   in regards to the macedonian government claiming greek land , then it should be noted that it probably is n't what won them the election . 
  but it was part of their ideology . 
  you cant ignore that . 
  and they wherent [ subtle ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/14/alexander-great-macedonia-warrior-horse ) either . 
  did you miss the part where the current goverment supports this idea ? 
  sure , greece leaving the union . 
  it has not being a good choice for all parties considered . 
  ahh patronising other member states . 
  the true spirit of the union right there . 
  i think you should [ read ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_macedonia?wprov=sfla1 ) a bit more before forming an opinion . 
  [ united macedonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_macedonia?wprov=sfla1 ), 
  afaik , the present day * goverment * of greece doesnt claim in any place in turkish , albanian or bulgarian soil . 
  while fyroms does . 
  as matter of fact i do know a lot of dutch and flemish that are still pissed about 1831 . 
   i just read that ancient ( city state ) greeks thought macedonians were backward half-idiots who were nomads , spoke in a laughable and unintelligible dialect , and were uncultured barbarians . 
  huh if the dutch wiki is using language like that , maybe you should try another version then . 
  and you assume i can read dutch because ? 
  are all those people making claims to other peoples lands ? 
  also the geographical region called macedonia is like , 10 % of the state . 
  and you * just * read that where ? 
  did you skipped the part where greece was independent kingdoms and cities and hated each others guts ? 
  does luxemburg a wants to claim luxemburg b ? 
  sooo having another sovereign state appropiate your history and throught that lay claim to half your country is `` nationalism '' . 
  what * you * think is irrelevant . 
  they are not getting in as long as greece is a member . 
  yup . 
  nope . 
  and they are not getting in either . 
  fyrom is not becoming a member anytime soon unless they fix that name . 
  greece will veto 100 % . 
  modern nationalism is a bit of a modern concept . 
  but if you think people didnt self identify themselves via mutual culture , language and history and warred of this since forever you are dumb . 
  the `` melting pot '' usually takes generations and its inevitable since cultures change and evolve anyways . 
  last king was constantine , and his interference with the democratic processes led to a coup d'etat by military hardliners and 7 years of dictatorship . 
  except some very old monarchists he is seen as a massive failure . 
  doesnt help that monarchy was imposed in greece by the great powers after indepedence ( first king was bavarian ) . 
  \u03a0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b1 / patritha ( th as is `` that '' ) . 
  its root means essentially `` fatherland '' . 
  but it is a feminine word .
