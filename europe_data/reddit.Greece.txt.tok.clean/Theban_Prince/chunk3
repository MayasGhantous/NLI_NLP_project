  its greek , what did you expect ? 
  carbonara with gruyere ... my god that sounds great . 
  i am greek in belgium and i also that . 
  not because some misguided adherence to queues , but because i have worked in retail/reception etc. 
  and i hated when i was busy with some bureucratic task yet clients barged in so * of ( c i had to deal with them while leaving the ( sometimes time critical ) task halfdone . 
  since these guys have the option to regulate their workflow i aint gona disrupt them !, 
  hahaha how cute are the young . 
  [ at ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thebes%2c_greece?wprov=sfla1 ) * minimum * 3200 years , probably a 1000 more , with continious occupation . 
  this is what i think also . 
  people that grew up in the post war world take peace , democracy and prosperity for granted . 
  they also think that fascism/nazism are dead because noone is wearing hugo boss uniforms or give fiery speeches about the jew problem . 
  thing is , those where local characteristics of those , and you cam be a fascist in a clean bussiness suit . . 
  as a relatively newcomer to the country , nowdays it seems mostly as a very embarassing point of history , but there seems to be an indecision on what to do about it . 
  tear up his statues and go full on censuring on his legacy ? 
  not quite easy when he is all over ther place considering his public works and the few numbers of kings . 
  so there are voices that claim if you went full on you would wreck a big chunk of belgiums history . 
  so on one hand everyone awknoledges how bad he fucked up but there is no active drive to `` bury '' him so to say . 
  is this a somewhat good picture ? 
  you can get a lot of meat out of your degree if you check the eu cities like brussels or strasbourg . 
  not only in the union agencies themselves but the non profit organisations , diplomatic missions , multinational hqs that had spawned around them etc. 
  and those exist in bigger or smaller scales in almost every capital . 
  in the us except perhaps in dc where else can you find international relations hubs ? 
  maybe ny and la ? 
  football : international ones : albania , turkey and other countries that we have diplomatic issues and/or past griviences . 
  this includes germany the last years , but since they wipe the floor with our team its one sided . 
  domestic : the rivarly between the two biggest clubs , olympiakos amd panathinaikos is legendary , and clashes between fans had escalated to murders . 
  two other national teams , aek and paok also have issues with those two and between them . 
  then you have regional disputes ( paok and aris on thessaloniki is one example etc ) . 
  effectively , if you go to a random match you have 1 to 3 chances the two teams hate each other and the fan might break the game by rioting . 
  yeah a serbian propaganda one with a stonefaced soldier . 
  its actually an older meme , spawned from a youtube video . 
  they are still taken . 
  its assumed they inherited them from kings that used state founds/taxes/their position to built them/buy them . 
  yeah but it just sounds similar : / . 
  from what i read sofa comes from suffah , an arabic word . 
  most countries that become republics take * also * their castles . 
  if you mean the english word sofa , they have absolutely no connection !, 
  the word psofa is a phonetic transliteration of \u03c8\u03c9\u03c6\u03b1 , nothing more . 
  psofa ( \u03c8\u03c9\u03c6\u03b1 ) meaning die . 
  but the word is normally only used for animal deaths so its even more demeaning ( go die you dog ) . 
  slow the eggs ( something is not as great/awesome as it is known to be ) slow the chanteliers ( same ) and the birds milk ( have a great variety of goods , usually food ) life and chicken ( living the great life , having every need fullfilled ) quite unique ones : the mosquitos/flies spawned asses and shited all the world ( implying someones opinion for a certain subject is irrelevant/stupid/he is a nobody ) dont eat , we have seagall soup ( dont have high expectations about something , usually demeaning , you are an idiot for having those ), 
  i am aware that babushka means grandma , and it makes sense because the default figure looks like an old lady ( greek old ladies also wore scarfs around their heads all the way until recent decades ) . 
  why we are using the * slavic * word while its * not * used by the slavs themselves to describe them is probably a mystery that will be forever unsolved . 
  the dolls are called like that were i am from , obviously not russia , 
  maybe they got bit one time too many in their home turf and decided they needed a warning sign ? 
  you know what they say about their bites !, 
  went there as a tourist and had the same reaction . 
  the ride at the end wasnt bad though . 
  you have to understand the peculiar love/hate relationaship belgians have with their country . 
  no , its something * more * that the typical love/hate relationship people normally have with their place . 
  also a lot of self deprecieting , dry humour . 
  i always wondered about that . 
  i mean on one part ( hopefully ) educating yourself about the prague spring and the communist past , and then going and buying a babuska . . 
  it would be like visiting boston , and all the tourist shops had `` original british tea ', 
  not common in greece . 
  a more common i have heard that could be equivelent is `` amerikanakia '' meaning `` little americans '' . 
  its not used in a positive tone . 
  seems to come from the idea that you are a young and naive nation . 
  i also heard it used for other nations too , but not that much . 
  sometimes ? 
  they are the equivelent of con men selling `` alternative meds big pharma doest want you to know about '' aka snake oil salesmen . 
  most of the time they are one and the same !, 
  in mid 2018 they will will start discussing candidates in earnest . . so much electiin overdose . . 
  in greece , we have a plural formal . 
  '' \u0395\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 '' is the plural and it is the same as vous , while '' \u03b5\u03c3\u03c5 '' is the equivalent of tu . 
  while its the same in most cases ( professors/teachers , bosses , old people etc ) we are slightly more relaxed in some situation . 
  for example , age plays a great role , and a shopkeeper in a small grocery store might speak to you in singular in you are the same age . 
  the insane things federalists post around giving us a bad name . 
  no really , the official federalist party of europe posted a similar one in facebook . 
  or maybe you should see the positives and the problemes in a more realistic manner and appriciate what you have . 
  and i live in bruxelles . . 
  in greece we have the old calentarists . 
  usually an ultraconservative part/ofshoot if the church . 
  but even the main body has conservatives * very * similar with the bible belt . 
  they even import tgeir concpiracy theories like 666 barcode marks , end of the word is nigh , suversion of true christian blood by gays etc. 
  exactly what i also thing as i get to know the country . 
  belgium could be an example on what to copy , and what to fix in a stronger eu . 
  i would like you to explain further the brussels question a bit if you wish . 
  no seriously , in greece that exchange is never happening especially if you are a guest . 
  and i have been in many * many * places.i do n't know what the guy is talking about . 
  i have visited multiple houses and/or have family in macedonia , crete , central greece , euboia , cyclades and i have never even once experienced it , shit it would be weird to even ask . 
  seems more of a quirk on the place you where than a common occurrence or the `` norm '' . 
  plus the dude had robots !, 
  we have the [ king 's pie ] ( http://www.exodos24.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/vasilopita.jpg ) in greece on or after new years eve . 
  its not similar in taste as the french , there is not marzipan in it but it is essentially a sweetbread ( cake ? ), 
  with white thin sugar springled on top of it . 
  instead of a petit jesus we insert a coin , usually made to look like it is gold . 
  then it is cut in pieces and the person that finds the coin in his piece is supposed to have good luck/being blessed for the rest of the year . 
  the first piece cut belongs to jesus . 
  we also dont use the paper crowns : / so all in all we have the same tradition . 
  from what i read it has ancient roots to greeks and romans , so i would be interested to see if it evolved in parallel from that , or got reintroduced in more recent time by french troops for example . 
  i have never * ever * been once in a place where guests are expected to take their shoes off . 
  back in the 90s early 2000s computers and cell phones did n't have a greek keyboard , so everyone wrote in [ greeklish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greeklish ) as they are called . 
  these days this problem does n't exist anymore , and people that write like that seem sloppy , ( and maybe a bit uneducated , because spelling faults are not that jarring to the eye , so they use them trying to hide it ) but they do exist . 
  in this case however i continued in greeklish because the guy started writing greek like that , so i was n't sure how confident he was with the alphabet , since he is not a natural speaker , 
  i can also throw random words around . 
  they do n't make an argument . 
  actually , african economies are getting better now that both europeans and american finally got the fuck out :  in march 2013 , africa was identified as the world 's poorest inhabited continent ; however , the world bank expects that most african countries will reach `` middle income '' status ( defined as at least us$ 1,000 per person a year ) by 2025 if current growth rates continue . 
  [ \\ [ 6 \\ ] ] ( http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2012/10/04/despite-global-slowdown-african-economies-growing-strongly-world-bank-urges-countries-spend-new-oil-gas-mineral-wealth-wisely ) in 2013 , africa was the world 's fastest-growing continent at 5.6 % a year , and gdp is expected to rise by an average of over 6 % a year between 2013 and 2023 . 
  [ \\ [ 3 \\ ] ] ( http://www.worldbank.org/en/region/afr/overview ) [ \\ [ 7 \\ ] ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21572377-african-lives-have-already-greatly-improved-over-past-decade-says-oliver-august ) growth has been present throughout the continent , with over one-third of sub-saharan african countries posting 6 % or higher growth rates , and another 40 % growing between 4 % to 6 % per year .
