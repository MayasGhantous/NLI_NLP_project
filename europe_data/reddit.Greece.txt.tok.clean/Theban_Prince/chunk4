  [ \\ [ 3 \\ ] ] ( http://www.worldbank.org/en/region/afr/overview ) several international business observers have also named africa as the future economic growth engine of the world [ \\ [ 8 \\ ] ] ( http://www.slideshare.net/kimberleeluce/rise-of-the-african-opportunity ) so no , you will not have 5 billions black dudes invading your village and stealing your women . 
  unless we fuck up the climate even more . 
   and our motives were good . 
  what good reason had * danish * soldiers being in a * middle eastern * country for fuck shake ? 
  yeah because you only have the options to either pick 100 dudes or 5 billion . 
   all cant be rich and happy ... 
  i am good with everyone being some shade of middle class . 
  meaning being easy to get good housing , food , clean water , electricity and education . 
   boy you are naive , there is scarcity . 
  there is natural scarcity , and there is forced scarcity . 
  for example , the us are absolute atrocious in food wastage . 
  they loose a whopping *** [ 40 % ] ( https://www.usda.gov/oce/foodwaste/faqs.htm ) *** of the food to wastage . 
   human morality only exist because people are more likely to survive in groups then alone . 
  true , that cause was the root in the previous millennia . 
  but it has been considerably lessened . 
  and you still can choose the overall morality of the group . 
   lol , get real . 
  5 billion people in the world live worse then in germany . 
  and we should try to get them in the best possible situation . 
  all of them . 
  there are no universal rules on how you have to behave that you have this mentality says quite a lot for you , not the world . 
  you should feel proud !, 
  yoy sound like an american . 
  maybe take a break from reddit ? 
  `` not all places at syria are at war '' . 
  fuck we have reached this point now ? 
  that the baseline human decency and quality if life is not getting bombed with barrel bombs ? 
  there is not an official meaning . 
  it is based on one of the flags used in the indepedence war against the ottomans and they where suposedly influenced by the byzantine banners of the late empire . 
  common story is that the colors represent the colors of the greek sky and sea . 
  the cross is about christianity ( duh ) and the number of lines re about the of the phrase `` freedom or death '' . 
  interesting is that until 1978 another greek flag was used , that was simply a big white cross in blue field , until it was completely discontinued for the navy jack ( if you see flags with lots of vertical flags like the greek or the american they have some connection to the navy ) after the fall of the dictatorship and kingdom . 
  plus german used a shiton of horses too . 
  i doubt anyone saw that shitty romcom anyways so you can rest easy . 
  while mama mia did the same to greece and it was pretty popular ... 
  some scottish do wear kilts during formal functions , that is true . 
  but they and tartans , their patterns , are not * that * old or so tied with scotish history as perceived . 
  something is not right here . 
  a baby would freeze in minutes sleeping . 
  edit : huh apparently not . 
  it would still seem weird to other europen countries though . 
  ehhh it looks boring . 
  like someone cntrl + v a pattern for a geocities website . 
  they really fucked up the three bars type of flags like france or ireland . 
  they should have made the stars smaller and in the center if the bar , similar withe the eagle on the mexican flag . 
  there where certain reports an interviews yes in the media from what i remember . 
  but it was mostly news agencys taping the political and social fringe to get some newsworthy material . 
  until you lose your best employee without notice . 
  and you are stuck with those that know they are not that valuable to find another job . 
  nah its the same . 
  you can take the day off some other day even if you work in the weekend . 
  at least with some contracts . 
  thats not a rumor , harrods had/has a memorial of the couple , two actually . 
  yeaaah no that sounds wayyy to much . 
  i see france as a hope for europe for that . 
  workers rights are like vaccines , people focus on some bad instances and believe tha life will continue as is whithout them , but oh boy if you take them away . . you dont want to live the experience of losing 3/4 of you wage , having in effect no vacations or social security rights and no protection from getting fired . . 
  the greek revolution , it has everything , the underdog fighting the empire , immense heroism but also atrocities , anti-villains and anti-heroes , glorious last stands , secret societies , musket battles , naval battles , pirates and brigands turned good and back again . 
  ending with a massive fleet battle where england , russia and france wrecked the ottoman fleet and seal the countrys future . 
  basically star wars with skirts and fezes . 
  its a fascinating period that doesnt get a decent view even by the greeks . 
  nobody uses the full name anymore , only in legal documents . 
  they might not be the first choice but they get a fare share of use , between major urban centers ( ahens-thessaloniki ) or for the islands . 
  the tricky hilly terrain that adds about 20 % time in your driving or the sea and the increasing availability of cheap airlines like ryanair will probably make it even more substantial . 
  plus the most recent and somewhat less controversial than usual . 
  and i would like to add that the feedback loop causes idiotic or impractical laws to appear because nobody cares since most will `` find a way '' to avoid it . 
  woe to the ones that they cant though . 
  stricter law implementation could presumably cause citizens to keep an eye on what they vote more . 
  obviously extremes are never good and common sense should prevail . 
  but in general , i would prefer a police officer that is stricter than one that bends the laws ** regularly ** . 
  most importantly is the perception of law implementation by the general public . 
  i come from a society where `` bending '' laws is almost an everyday occurence , but that causes a feedback loop that results into everyone to behave like this . 
  the law is the law . 
  it doesnt change in the streets but in the voting booths . 
  the more people understand that then less corruption will exist . 
  for more interesting info about the greek coins : the 1,2 and 5 cents decipt the maritime history from the ancient times to modern , the 10 , 20 and 50 poltical figures that shaped our modern times : rigas ferraios - indepedence from turkey , kapodistrias - establishment of the state , and eleytherios venizelos that more than doubled the size of the country in early 20th century and is considered one of the greatest prime ministers ( if not the greatest ) . 
  so our coins are some of the few that have a small story on them !, 
  actually , her opinions are not that uncommon , and the bad blood between countries is not from 1453 but also fairly recent . 
  during the 90s we almost went to actual war , when our fleets had a [ standoff ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imia/kardak#military_crisis ) . 
  yeah!even better analogy !, 
  i hope you dont judge only by your trains , because they are quite ahead in quality , 
  there is some very very bad history , and i would not except some greeks to reciprocate the feelings . 
  hence why i find it faschinating . 
  however we have a lot of common history and culture ties , lots of greeks sem to think its the turkish * state * that causes issues and we tried to came closer during the late 90s ( see earthquake diplomacy ) so when we meet in germany for examplw they feel like they accudently meet their cousin in a far away place , even if they hated each other as kids and got in fistfights . 
  its weird !, 
  on new years eve morning , small children go door to door singing the [ new years eve carol ] ( https://youtu.be/ouq8glpnoy4 ) for treats/small amount of money ( the same happens in christmas eve btw but with a different song ) . 
  after midnight a traditional song we sing is the one called approximately [ `` happy new year/the old year has departed '' ] ( https://youtu.be/1yapflxcjbc ) . 
  i live abroad . 
  it always faschinates me when i meet turkish people because when they hear i am greek their whole face lightens up like they found a long lost brother !, 
  its something else than the president elect of a coubtry tge other side of the sea . 
  a few points , pearl harbor was not a remote base , but the major pacific one , and it was a very essential point for the war as a whole . 
  ofcource schools will not spend time there due to constraints , but if you want to claim you even have a basic ww2 knoledge you had read about it . 
  i am surpised zakynthos us not one of your best places . 
  it has a very good fame even for greeks . 
  i have a sentimental sweet spot since it is my fathers birthplace , but the local dresses ( [ example ] ( http://propeh.b2bmall.gr/img/p/12-52-thickbox.jpg ) , [ headress ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/80/75/4b/80754b1f9c3e2e8f12cdc32aadb7e960.jpg ) ) from a specific part of macedonia , close to thessaloniki look pretty bad-ass for folk costumes , especially since folklore claims are combat/war connected . 
  in athens most high income , urban/subruban areas are located either north at the hills , ( [ ekali ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ekali ) , [ psychiko ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/psychiko ) are examples ) or south/south west along the coast ( [ example : glyfada ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glyfada ) ) . 
  a more clear [ map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yoflnbg.png ) about income disparity in the city . 
  obviously that is not set by law , it is driven by m ^ 2 prices . 
  other cities have similar areas , with hilly forest areas with good views or next to the sea most desirable .

  greece was economically left wing in the 80s early 90s , then from the end of that decade , even center left goverments started implementing more conservative policies ( the way and effect they did that is another discussion ) .
