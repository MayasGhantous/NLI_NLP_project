  a healthy culture would react by trying to `` win back '' its disenfranchised members by solidarity and support . 
  but you , being greek , react by kicking dissenters even further away . 
  its how you were brought up , its what you are . 
  you ca n't help it . 
  i just hope this negativity i allegedly help spread ( lol its just a stupid , meaningless conversation in a sub of questionable quality ) burns so bright that it destroys our culture completely . 
  we are dying from cancer and you are talking about morale . 
  total denial . 
  you are talking pure ideology . 
  i agree that it sounds nice in theory , in some utopian world maybe , but reality has demonstrated that the exact opposite is true : we need moderation to keep it together . 
  i am not sure about the why or how , but it is what it is . 
  even heavy moderation is not bad as long as its * transparent * , like if you know what is going on and why , if you are given reasons for the actions of the moderators and can understand their decisions . 
  no not really , it means we are an extremely polarized sub where few civilized discussions can take place . 
  only a troll would like such a situation . 
  i hope so , because then their complaining will stop . 
  but i would n't be so optimistic . 
  great comment . 
  i wish all the upvotes flock to you , sir . 
  i agree completely . 
  of course , we ca n't do that , because there is a large number of religious * christian * conservatives lying around . 
  they would never allow for this . 
  do n't let reddit fool you . 
  europe is not some kind of perfect secular liberal utopia as the anti-muslim crowd wants you to believe . 
  they are simply saying this to pretend that muslims are incompatible with europe when some extreme nationalist parties are just as incompatible , if not more . 
  code for `` let the muslims secularize first , we 'll keep our christianity for now '', 
  what exactly do you think will happen ? 
  i find a disturbing lack of nationalist outrage about this . 
  will no one complain about the pc brigade ? 
  no one to complain that he is being labelled a `` racist '' by the multicultural leftists , in an attempt to silence his proud nationalist voice ? 
  come on !, 
  salah abdeslam is clearly an intelligent muslim who represents all muslims perfectly and also interprets his religion 100 % correctly . 
  in contrast to , say , anders breivik who was just a crazy idiot who totally misinterpreted christianity and nationalism !, 
  exactly , so you agree with them . 
  your comment  i think it would be pretty naive to dismiss that probability was n't really valid because no one is dismissing any probabilities . 
  neither me nor you . 
  especially you , because you are not talking about probabilities but certainties . 
  i can grant you any probability you want , but the point remains , that 's is disgusting how easily people are swayed by the media ** as long as it fits their preconceived notions ** . 
  the disgusting part is that the same people think they are some kind of intelligent anti-pc media-critical skeptics . 
  sadly they are not . 
   i 'm actually saying the opposite : the immigrants should absolutely not be provided with any amount of money that exceeds the amount of money given to regular citizens of a given country . 
  well there is too much difference between us . 
  your starting point is some ideological position which i do n't share . 
  i tried to explain how reality is and why such things are acceptable . 
  why pensioners and refugees are receiving whatever it is they are receiving . 
  there are rational reasons for this . 
  good reasons that are fair and make sense . 
  but you seem set to oppose it on ideological grounds , so no matter what i say , it wo n't affect you . 
  at least this is my understanding . 
  by the way , i should point out that you are still under the misapprehension that bulgaria is giving 500 $ to each refugee and 150 $ to each pensioner . 
  this is a ridiculous idea and any conclusions drawn from it will be just as ridiculous , if not more . 
  pensioners obviously receive more from their government and will keep receiving until they die , as they should . 
  refugees very limited accommodations for a limited amount of time , which may very be cut short . 
  their doom is but one `` bad '' electoral results away . 
  i think i already mentioned arguments of that sort but ideology is ideology ...  i do n't think greeks get to make clever comments about the state of other countries right now , sorry xd we totally get to , if we are clever enough  feel free to try to make similar comments about greece , i welcome witty remarks , if you can make them . 
  but that is what the greek population wants to hear . 
  its the only language we understand . 
  you do n't talk to greek people like normal human beings . 
  you make noises towards them like they are fucking wild animals that must be either appeased or scared away . 
  so `` no shit '' means `` not dismissing that probability '' ? 
  it does n't . 
  you agreed with the media and the us official . 
  i did n't call you a racist , i did n't say you are anti-immigration , it does n't matter really . 
  do n't take it personally . 
  its clear that this sub is extremely critical against media ( and other sources ) who do n't have a negative view towards refugees and/or muslims in general . 
  on the other hand , any media that advances the anti-migrant agenda is ** immediately ** met with praise . 
  even us officials , of all fucking people . 
  its like we totally forgot the bush era . 
   i get it , but the percentage of real refugees needing help is too small for me to care . 
  what would that % be ? 
  out of what number ? 
   let the bored rich people of the west worry about saving everyone on the other side of the planet . 
  fair enough . 
  they are probably paying for it anyway , its not like they are taking your money . 
  yeah that is why i said `` i am talking about the honest ones here '' . 
  maybe i was n't clear . 
  what i said applies only to the actual refugees . 
  but still the topic has nothing to do with illegal immigration so i guess you have another agenda here ? 
  anyway if they are lying , the amount they receive does not matter , even if its less than your pensioners , because they do n't deserve it . 
  i find your trust in politicians and media disturbing . 
  seriously though its funny ( and kind of sad ) how this sub immediately agrees with any anti-muslim news article . 
  any other kind of opinion , any opinion that is n't totally anti-muslim or anti-refugee is met with unrelenting cynicism . 
  like the media are full of lies and propaganda , the politicians hate and deceive you , do n't trust anyone etc. 
   why ca n't we be equal ? 
  because they are fleeing for their lives ( talking about the honest ones here ) and a bulgarian pensioner has a pension , healthcare , family , support network , legal rights etc basically a bunch of stuff that you get by default , stuff which a refugee will never have . 
  so you will always be more equal than him or her . 
  which is obviously correct , because you are the native citizens after all . 
  absolutely everyone in the eu has it better than the refugees , even the poorer bulgarian . 
  the opportunities you are given just by being in the eu and being allowed to travel and work here are amazing . 
  not to mention the funds you receive - which are conveniently forgotten in this narrative . 
  sadly , everyone thinks he has it worse than everyone else . 
  the grass is always greener !, 
  fleeing from your home and family is considered a privileged position in this schizophrenic sub . 
  and many greeks too rage on about the refugees have it `` better '' , its not the first time i 've heard this , its depressingly common for poor countries to hate downwards . 
  edit : syntax, 
  well , in the same fashion , what you are doing is just as bad . 
  also its weird to complain about american cnn in / r/europe but have fun i guess ? 
  people used to argue that slavery was a long time ago , get over it etc. 
  that was centuries ago . 
  now the bar has dropped to 20 years ? 
  what 's next , the war was 1 year ago , get over it ? 
  do n't trust the media or the politicians !,
