  you originally said `` black while woman '' and i thought you had a problem with black women identifying as such . 
  that would have been funnier . 
  but anyway a crazy person has nothing to do with political correctness . 
  if you think this is political then we are entering into `` cultural marxism '' aka `` extremely retarded '' territory , which i wo n't venture into . 
   so , calling someone a person of colour combats `` the effects of racism '' more than calling them black ? 
  umm . 
  look at what the crazy black white woman [ said ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11672742/i-consider-myself-black-says-white-woman-who-posed-as-an-african-american.html ) :  she told television network krem news : `` i actually do n't like the term african-american . 
  ** i prefer black ** , and i would say that if i was asked i would definitely say that yes i do consider myself to be black . '', 
  also calling someone `` black '' is n't exactly politically incorrect , as [ some sources ] ( http://grammarist.com/usage/african-american-black/ ) show . 
  having said that , maybe you can fucking try to understand what i am saying instead of nitpicking . 
   yes it does . 
  what about the black while woman ? 
  wat  i 'm sorry , are you trying to say the opposite of pc is racism ? 
  are you demented ? 
  no , i think it is an attempt to combat the effects of racism . 
  i would n't say its the `` opposite '' of racism . 
  that would be demented indeed . 
  i was n't referring to your politeness , but the context . 
  some of my greek female friends have been told that they should n't focus so much on their career because `` men and women are different '' . 
  so you see where i am going with this . 
  did you say it out of the blue ? 
  like , `` goodmorning gurl , males and females are different , have a nice day '' ? 
  you make a good point but its not the racist attacks that inspire people . 
  its the years of media propaganda against the eu and the immigrants . 
  so i agree , if your media stops over-reporting any bad thing the eu/media allegedly does , we might see a decrease in violence . 
  but it will take time . 
   my problem with political correctness is that the political correctness rules often stop people from using their minds it really does n't . 
  there is no evidence to support this anyway . 
  stewart lee , despite being just a comedian , gives an awesome explanation of what political correctness is :  an often clumsy negotiation towards a formally inclusive language . 
  does it occasionally suck ? 
  sure . 
  you know what sucks more ? 
  racism . 
  life is not black and white , most times you have to pick the * least shitty way * to do things . 
  political correctness is just that . 
  you jest but i met a turkish girl who , when visiting germany , complained that the germans had stolen `` their '' ruins from bergama and kept them in the [ pergamon museum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pergamon_museum ) . 
  i would have corrected her but she was too hot to risk upsetting . 
  i was hoping the peloponnese would fucking float away after the canal was dug , but no luck, 
  also the poorest acropolis in europe . 
  well depends . 
  it is a collective identity . 
  if you want to feel pride for how awesome it is and its history etc then yeah you need to take in the good with the bad . 
  if your people are acting like cunts you should be ashamed . 
  its normal . 
  being shameless is generally considered a bad thing . 
   the netherlands is an incredibly individualistic society umm  see it as a waste of money which could be better spent on things like the military that is a contradiction . 
  you know what the army is , right ? 
  why do you know so much about this stuff lol, 
  many people realized it , but were quickly put down by cries of `` political correctness has gone mad ! '', 
  and `` they are not racist , they just love their country ! '' . 
  the same , tired old shit that we read all the time . 
  even in germany too , where people [ firebombed refugees shelters ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/27/world/europe/germany-migrant-arson-trial.html?_r=0 ) and the angry right wingers were retorting with `` they are not racist , they are just skeptical of immigration ! '' . 
  anyway most sensible people saw this coming and warned against it . 
  repeatedly . 
  but who gives a shit . 
  oh well , now we 'll get to see what uk looks like without `` political correctness gone mad '' , where everyone is encouraged to express his or her hatred without fear of the consequences . 
  well done !, 
  i am not proud , i thought this would be understood as sarcasm, 
  who cares about facts when you have `` sovereignty '', 
  you are exaggerating . 
  that is not the real problem . 
  the real problem is political correctness gone mad , trying to label anyone voting leave as a racist/xenophobe . 
  here is a list of possible responses to this incident : * just a few bad apples . 
  they do n't represent the proud patioric english people . 
  * its largely unrelated to the referendum . 
  these incidents happen all the time , its just that now that the globalist media are reporting on them . 
  * but what about the damage the immigrants did to the uk ? 
  they are driving wages down . 
  * but what about what the muslims did to the uk ? 
  they raped and killed . 
  * this is a fake/staged incident set by the globalists and the leftists . 
  stop giving them attention and it will go away . 
  * stop calling me a racist * i am not a racist ( you can choose any number of excuses , but at least one ) edit : jesus christ ** / s ** people . 
  i ca n't believe anyone took this seriously . 
  this is literally the most sarcastic comment i 've written . 
  well if you listen to right wingers ( especially american republicans ) they argue that being poor is a choice too . 
  personal responsibility and all that . 
  and whether they have a choice to wear that shit or not , does not negate the fact that this law targets muslims . 
  you are welcome . 
  but maybe you should n't have replied with another moronic one ? 
  first of all , nobody cares about your sex life . 
  secondly , if people tell you `` not really '' , then you should stop . 
  period . 
  if your girlfriend is ok with you trying to fuck her after she said `` no '' , then that is between you two guys . 
  but please do n't try it on others . 
  people generally do n't like others touching them despite having said `` no '' . 
  especially when a stronger person does it to a vastly weaker one , e.g. 
  man on woman , it can be quite scary . 
  but the opposite can also be traumatizing , as there are sadly many examples of it . 
  anyway this is common sense . 
  even kids know this . 
  at least , kids who were raised properly and not like fucking animals . 
  now go away and leave me alone with your shitty comments . 
  what a shit justification . 
  someone once said :  in its majestic equality , the law forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges , beg in the streets and steal loaves of bread . 
  no clear analogy between the poor and the muslims , but the point is clear . 
  the law targets specific groups . 
  yes , it technically does apply to everyone , but that is a thin veneer . 
  the americans are historically doing something similar with their drug laws : targeting specific minority groups . 
  well that is too fucking bad .
