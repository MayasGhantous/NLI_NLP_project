  you should not hire anyone that does n't fit your needs . 
  your mistake is that you are looking at the very specific problems you face daily ( like the stuff you mentioned ) and turn around and think people are unqualified for not being able to solve them . 
  or , not good enough . 
  this is why developers are frustrated from interviews like these , because people like you are inherently dismissive of other people 's professional lives . 
  if someone has past experience ( and , preferably , projects to show ) then that person has proven to have delivered value to the market , regardless of your opinion . 
  and have you been formally trained how to interview someone ? 
  i hope you have , because everyone else i know has not . 
  we just wing it . 
  which was the original point . 
   why is that a problem ? 
  you 're being hired as a programmer , we 're going to check if you can do at least basic stuff before we bring you in . 
  i do n't see how that 's unreasonable . 
  most people , including myself , dislike whiteboard tests because its stressful and annoying . 
  how about giving the candidate a laptop and 10 minutes ( or a specific amount of time ) ? 
  way easier . 
  but ultimately that should be up to the candidate and not you , because this is n't high school , its a job interview and that means both sides need to meet in the middle . 
  for example in the company i work now they actually asked me , do i want to use the whiteboard or my laptop ? 
  very helpful . 
  looking back , i should have demanded the same from other companies . 
   i 'm sorry , but do you realize who entitled you sound right now ? 
  it 's ok . 
  it goes both ways my friend . 
  i would n't work with you and since you would n't work with my either , please do n't change your hiring process for me . 
   just because you do n't see the value of something does n't mean it 's stupid or wrong . 
  if you want people to hire you , make sure you 've got the skills to do the job . 
  the jobs i interview for require basic knowledge of math and algos . 
  and if you do n't want to spend time acquiring those skills , that 's your choice , but do n't piss on me for trying to hire people that meet my bar . 
  you seem determined to make this personal . 
  but i do n't really care about people hiring me because i have a decent job and if i ever want another one then i am capable of being hired . 
  it seems you actually have a problem finding people . 
  i would recommend , instead of complaining , you should hire the best candidate ( or should i say the `` least terrible '' one ? ), 
  and try to groom him or her into the developer you need . 
  but that requires assessing someone 's learning capabilities , which is more difficult than just throwing him a list of algorithms . 
  in short , waiting for a `` rockstar '' or `` unicorm '' developer to appear might end up costing more than just hiring an average developer and molding him or her to your needs . 
  and i can only repeat your advice : just because you do n't see the value in some people does not mean that they are bad ( as you said `` do n't even know the basics '' ) . 
  i am sure you are great with these algorithms but that does not make you a qualified judge of value . 
  and that is the original point , few people - if any - can judge . 
  your joke was spot on , do n't worry / u/respect _ my_slavspace just agrees with some of his views , so he felt the need to defend him, 
   i was born canadian but i identify as american . 
   bring it . 
  we own guns and god is on our side . 
   just accept it . 
  billions are burning right now and billions will burn forever . 
  but tell us what you really think, 
   just yesterday i interviewed a candidate for an entry-level position . 
  this guy could not come up with an efficient way to merge two sorted lists . 
  could not come up with a way to efficiently remove duplicate entries in a list . 
  could not efficiently take the last k entries in a forward linked list . 
  sorry but that is just what i said the stuff you mentioned are not the basics of any craft . 
  i mean i could n't answer you either right now . 
  and you probably had him on front of a whiteboard or a piece of paper , which is even worse . 
  the definition of a ritual . 
  these questions are something we memorize when we need a job . 
  we go to these websites `` 100 most common it interview questions '' and learn all these algorithmic things until we land a job i mean its more like hazing at this point , but a more sad kind of hazing done by nerds to nerds, 
  personally i 'm more of an hr guy, 
  you just demonstrated why there are few girls in it, 
   my wife is in it recruiting and there just are n't candidates there are candidates . 
  granted they are not many but they are there . 
  its just that people do not know how to recruit in it . 
  and i do n't mean this in a bad way about your wife , even developers themselves do n't know how to recruit or what skills to look for . 
  our interviews are literally rituals , meaningless rituals , couple of hours of pure madness that both sides know is bs besides that , the market itself has not realized that while unemployment in general is high , in it its pretty low . 
  but they still treat workers as expendable . 
  your wife might spend weeks poaching a worker , spending a lot of resources to successfully hire him or her , but as soon as he or she starts the company goes like `` hurr durr sink or swim , you got 6 months to figure it out or gtfo '' source : happily employed in it for years . 
  never had a problem finding a job . 
  though i have not worked in spain but this seems to be the global trend from my anecdotal evidence, 
  i am sorry but that is a little bullshit your country is one of the few countries in human history that has learned from its past and done a full 180 \u00b0 we take germany for granted now , but this deliberate cultural change is extremely rare . 
  most people never do that , they just blame either immigrants or politicians all day long without actually changing their attitude, 
  thanks for writing that !, 
  i am embarrassed to say that i knew nothing of lithuanian history but your wall of text really educated me . 
  good post . 
  definitely the [ greco-turkish war of 1919-1922 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greco-turkish_war_ ( 1919 % e2 % 80 % 9322 \\ ) ) . 
  ever since greeks won their independence in 1832 , [ irridentism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/megali_idea ) dominated politics , with main objective being taking back constantinople and asia minor from the ottomans . 
  one could argue that this was the whole point of the new greek state , the entire reason of its existence was to take back the ancient capital . 
  after ww1 , as the ottoman empire was collapsing , the opportunity presented itself . 
  greeks , along with the italians , the french and the english , invaded what is now turkey , attacking from all directions , with overwhelming numbers . 
  initially the greeks did well . 
  we almost won , having made everyone to sign the [ treaty of s\u00e8vres ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_s%c3%a8vres ) , which should have been the perfect victory ; all the ancient lands returned to us , hellenism would be made whole again , all that shit , etc. 
  but atat\u00fcrk was not having any of that and proceeded to [ fuck everyone 's shit up in a spectacular fashion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_war_of_independence ) . 
  the rest is history . 
  turkey came into being , some genocides here and there , also the terrible [ population exchange of 1923 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/population_exchange_between_greece_and_turkey ) . 
  the greek state , a very militaristic and virulently expansive entity , lost its momentum and pretty much settled its borders to this day . 
  it could be said that the cause of all this was the greek [ national schism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_schism ) that took place around 1910 . 
  this `` schism '' could very well be the `` most important historical events '' in my country 's history , to answer op 's question . 
  it was a series of disagreements between our [ king ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constantine_i_of_greece ) and our [ prime minister ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eleftherios_venizelos ) at the time . 
  these bickering between these two dudes has underpinned greece 's politics to this day : it initially determined the country 's foreign policy during ww1 and set the stage for the disastrous greco-turkish ( see above ) , the bitterness of that lost war led to the creation of our own [ fascist regime ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4th_of_august_regime ) , elements of which took part in the [ greek civil war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_civil_war ) , the victors of which eventually staged a [ coup in 1967 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_military_junta_of_1967%e2%80%9374 ) , which led to cyprus being [ colonized by the turks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_invasion_of_cyprus ) . 
  this enmity finally simmered down around [ 1974 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metapolitefsi ) but you can still feel the hatred between the [ communist party of greece ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communist_party_of_greece ) and various [ neonazi groups ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golden_dawn_ ( political_party \\ ) ) , all of which is ultimately traced back to these two dudes bickering . 
  i know that both of them were great men and did good things for our nation , but fuck them a little bit . 
  douchebags . 
  edit : spelling . 
   yes ... but the cost to teach the neo-proletariat `` zombie apocalypse  '' such a lesson , would be insurmountably damaging to the country , or rather at that time `` countries '' . 
  not in the long run . 
  by making the consequences crystal clear , people will hopefully stop listening to demagogues . 
  do n't give the brexiters any room for excuses . 
  no wiggle room to blame anyone else . 
  give them what they want 100 % , stop all immigration , hell even let them mass deport their millions of immigrants , that is what they want right ? 
  sure you will have to sacrifice a generation to get the message across , but it is what it is, 
   japan and the great dive ... 
  i think you forgot to close your porn tabs : /, 
  that does n't matter because the undemocratic states were also american i do n't know if you are new to social science or not . 
  what is clear is that you are not a role model for civil liberties , which is why few people in europe look up to you in that regard .
