  one more time ? 
  the difference is ( at least , one of ** many ** differences ) is that mlk argued that african americans should have equal rights . 
  he never tried to dictate how whites should live or what their culture should be like . 
  what you are doing is trying to make everyone share your own conservative lifestyle . 
  you are expressing opinions about how other people should live , and then you go and vote for populist far right wingers to bring your ideas into law . 
  huge difference . 
  and yeah sorry but you are not entitled to that . 
  the world does n't owe you anything . 
  you can only dictate what you do on your own property . 
   it was in the article posted here yesterday . 
  i do n't think so . 
  i searched for your quoted text and it does not appear anywhere . 
  i mean i could be wrong , but i would expect it to be visible . 
   if you 're in a society where it 's not the norm to wear a headscarf at work and your employer asks you to remove it , just take it off ; you need to make an effort to integrate into local culture . 
  nope , employers are not arbiters of culture . 
  luckily the law bans visible crosses as much as burqas so its ok . 
   how can you be tired of hearing so many people talk of an idea because it 's a group of mostly non-germans that are ideologically committed to bringing back a conservative way of life and shoving it down our throats . 
  this groups resides on the internet and is particularly angry , using trollish tactics . 
  that is why they are visible . 
  in real life , they are not so visible . 
  especially not in germany . 
  believe me you 'd find very few people arguing for `` identity by blood '' in germany . 
  that comes from what i assume to be a genuine concern for human life . 
  on the other hand , your patronizing comments arise from the frustration of not seeing the world functioning as you think it should i.e. 
  a neatly arranged series of imposed conservative monocultures . 
  i am sorry man but you are just not entitled to have a world exactly as you 'd want it . 
  people are different . 
   people are upset because the proposed categories include things like `` negative comments against immigration '' - which is absurd . 
  i 'm sorry i did n't find this in the article nor in the [ press release ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-16-1937_en.htm ) . 
  you put quotes around it so i guess you are quoting someone ? 
   if you think you need to cover up the women in your life because otherwise they 're just asking to get raped , then yeah , you 're an uncivilized barbarian . 
  that 's great , but lets not move the goalposts . 
  what if you wear your headscarf to work ? 
  how much of an anti-european terrorist does that make you , like on a scale from 1 to 10 ? 
  he has a point though . 
  all you guys keep repeating is how dumb the germans are for abandoning their blood and not worshiping their conservative culture that they themselves put to rest . 
  it 's their right to do so . 
  how can you judge others like this ? 
  just because someone has a boner for conservative monocultures does not mean all people should be forced to live that way . 
   the notion of identity by blood died long ago yes it has . 
  please let it rest . 
  it 's not coming back . 
  it 's already over and you are bemoaning its loss as if it happened yesterday . 
  it 's a done deal . 
  your mistake lies in thinking this is caused by a global leftist conspiracy , and not the people themselves . 
   the notion of identity by blood died long ago germans know this . 
  they chose it . 
  it was n't forced upon them . 
  i understand that you are opposed to any society that does not have a conservative monoculture imposed upon its members and in all aspects of their lives ... but please realise that some people do n't want to live that way . 
  and that is ok . 
  again you are talking about `` cause '' . 
  nobody talked about that . 
  we are talking about incitement , for which libel is a good example , it 's perfectly understood and accepted by everyone and there are already laws against it . 
  we are not arguing semantics , you just started talking about `` cause '' and `` personal responsibility '' which is anyone 's guess . 
  i generally avoid vague , subjective concepts . 
  you may want to google `` libel '' . 
  words can have an objectively negative impact on your life . 
  i am surprised you do n't know this , because everybody else does . 
   and that punishing incitement as a cause for actions is foolish . 
  i do n't know what that means . 
  as a cause ? 
  nobody argued that . 
  the law says : incitement . 
  also words are `` just words '' but sometimes verbal harassment is literally worse than violence . 
  i think any adult understands this . 
  it 's ok to doubt it , since you are agnostic  but it 's still true . 
  i do n't share your understanding of european history nor current european values ( which are very different than those of the barbaric christian middle ages ) . 
  and that 's ok . point is , we have the same rights even if we disagree . 
  you do n't have a special status because you identify with christianity . 
  so no , you do n't get to wear whatever you want , like for example your cross :  to ban `` any visible signs of their political , philosophical or religious beliefs '' . 
  keep that stuff out of sight please . 
  sadly not because / u/jackalripper argued against incitement . 
  look at [ how this started ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4m64t6/arstechnica_google_twitter_facebook_hate_speech/d3svr22 ) . 
  you , on the other hand , accept that incitement is a real thing . 
  it can happen . 
  so you disagree . 
  it 's over . 
  no one mentioned the responsibility of the perpetrator himself , which is pretty much given . 
  you will be held responsible even if others `` convinced '' you to do stuff . 
  and as i said nobody mentioned that , or even argued against it . 
  this is just a false dichotomy you guys set up . 
  i think i was pretty clear ? 
  being european is not limited to being christian . 
  so you should n't get any special privileges . 
  so / u/jackalripper was wrong ? 
  he clearly mentioned incitement to violence . 
  to incite :  encourage or stir up ( violent or unlawful behaviour ) i also like how he one-upped despite you arguing the exact opposite . 
  says the bulgarian who a mere 5 years ago was considered a gypsy thief invader . 
  ask any nationalist what they said about you . 
  also no , this is not your continent . 
  you do n't own it . 
  i am an atheist and i do n't adhere to any of these alleged christian `` values '' and `` traditions '' and this continent is my own just as much as it is yours whether you like it or not ( you do n't , which means you 'll just have to deal with it ) . 
   responsibility is still his/her for these actions i do n't see what this has to do with anything . 
  if you murder someone you are always held responsible , no matter who `` convinced '' you to do it . 
  you may find this surprising but people are influenced by other people . 
  not arguing for or against this law , just saying , words tend to affect others . 
  how can it possibly be otherwise ? 
  do you think humans exist in an isolated solipsistic state ? 
   the date is just coincidence . 
  you forgot an ** / s **,
