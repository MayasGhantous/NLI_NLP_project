  i was n't able to pinpoint it . 
  but anyway , yes he supports some traditionally progressive ideas but he is the exception among his far-right allies . 
  so you do n't , gotcha, 
   one can easily vote , for example , golden dawn because they provide a scapegoat and an easy solution . 
  all politicians provide that . 
  especially greek ones . 
  so to treat the golden dawn voters like a different kind of people is weird . 
  old people are generally more conservative . 
  the anti-eu campaign has a lot of nationalism thrown in it , so you can imagine why they would support a brexit . 
   europe is not descending into the `` right wing '' , a couple parties are gaining protest votes because the others wo n't tackle the issue of immigration . 
  oh ok , i guess austria must be a hallucination then . 
  or is the fp\u00d6 just a bunch of `` misunderstood centrists '' too ? 
   if the flow of refugees was stopped tomorrow the `` right wing revival '' would vanish as quickly as it appeared . 
  maybe , maybe not . 
  political correctness has been broken and there are a lot of muslims already living in europe . 
  these parties might lose some support but they still have a lot of things to fight for . 
   do n't be silly . 
  if most europeans generally were for smaller government , lower taxes etc you are using american definitions for right and left , so you might want to reconsider who is silly here . 
   and i 'm not talking about banning minarets and burqas , but building huuuuge walls and stop letting muslims in . 
  have you seen a map of greece recently ? 
  there is water all over the god damn place . 
  ca n't build a wall on that . 
  i too think that people are stupid sometimes but never to the extent that they would be tricked into voting far right parties on such retarded premises . 
  seriously , no . 
  clearly their message resonates and we should deal with this reality as honestly as possible . 
  so acting against your country makes you a leftist ? 
  ah yes , you are completely reasonable . 
   i protest voted golden dawn . 
  i do n't agree with most of their policies and i doubt there is anyone in there fit to lead as they are essentially organized thugs , but i voted for the message that there is a want and a need for something other than the garbage parties we currently have . 
  honest question , if you were a politician and saw people voting for a far right party , what would you think the message would be ? 
  be more progressive ? 
  be more liberal ? 
  i do n't get how voting for a self-proclaimed [ national socialist ] ( https://jailgoldendawn.com/2015/01/05/%cf%84%ce%bf-%ce%ba%cf%81%cf%85%cf%86%cf%8c-%cf%80%cf%81%cf%8c%ce%b3%cf%81%ce%b1%ce%bc%ce%bc%ce%b1-%cf%84%ce%b7%cf%82-%cf%87%cf%81%cf%85%cf%83%ce%ae%cf%82-%ce%b1%cf%85%ce%b3%ce%ae%cf%82/ ) organization i disagree with is meant to wizen up our politicians . 
  if nothing else , i think it gives them very wrong ideas about which direction we want to go . 
  edit : i am not calling you or anyone else a racist . 
  so lets void all that pointless whining shall we ? 
  no one is being called a racist here . 
   this is a yet another example of `` everyone who disagrees with me is racist '' argument nice ad hominem . 
  i never called anyone a racist . 
  i know you would absolutely love to be called one , but i 'm sorry that i did n't call you one . 
  so no self-victimization for you this time . 
  and why are you so incredibly condescending towards the supporters of these parties ? 
  guess what : there are people who support fp\u00d6 and you do n't get to tell them that their support is not honest . 
  we are not talking about right wing parties in general here ; if you went and voted for a sane right wing party then i would agree with you . 
  but we are talking about insane far right wingers . 
  people who want to ban abortion under any circumstances . 
  in europe 2016 . 
  i do n't get why these people must either be `` deceived '' or `` frustrated '' enough to vote for these parties , like they are teenagers throwing a temper-tantrum . 
  they are responsible adults and will be treated as such . 
  i like how you wrote `` edited for clarification '' as if you were clarifying something and were not correcting your obviously wrong statement on the `` left '' ruling things . 
   right parties say that they will give a definite solution ( even if it is a wrong one ) . 
  like banning minarets and burqas ? 
  lol . 
  yes , definite solutions . 
  lets ignore that far right wing parties have been screaming the same things for decades now . 
  lets pretend that banning calls to prayer will terminate the civil war in syria . 
  are you willing to see your kids drown to reach europe ? 
  yes . 
  but you ca n't call to prayer very loud , you have to do it silently . 
  ah no then , i guess i 'll stay among the civil war with my family . 
  / s  so , it makes sense that people are turning towards the right . 
  or , we can treat adults as adults and accept that they vote for these parties because they want to be ruled by them . 
  you do n't vote a representative to rule your country for many years because you disagree with him on 99 % of the issues but agree on 1 % . 
  i do n't understand why we are making excuses about other peoples ' behavior . 
  it 's their choice and they should be held accountable for it . 
  angry right wingers pretending they are not right wingers and thinking they are anti-establishment this is how you get to this farce, 
  there are many non-ruling parties to vote for . 
  for example in germany its not just merkel and the afd . 
  [ there are 14 major parties ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_political_parties_in_germany ) . 
  but yes the deliberate polarization generates more karma . 
  everyone except our party is a corrupt establishment politician !, 
   but most of the money loaned is mostly to save the corruption of private banks what ? 
  the loans were to cover greece 's budget deficits . 
  it 's money we took and spent . 
  i 'm sorry but the prevalent rhetoric is bullshit . 
  take it from someone who has seen it happening . 
  there are a lot of people with far right views , wanting to [ ban abortion ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/31/polish-prime-minister-favours-ban-on-abortion ) , [ use lethal force against refugees ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/afd-deputy-backpedals-on-shooting-at-refugee-children/a-19015194 ) , [ ban islam ] ( https://www.rt.com/news/341558-afd-germany-islam-manifesto/ ) , supporting [ discrimination against homosexuals ] ( http://www.viennareview.net/news/special-report/the-closet-creaks-open ) , or [ various ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10027315/ukip-candidate-pe-prevents-people-becoming-gay.html ) [ other ] ( http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2404197/ukip-manifesto-delivers-climate-sceptic-wish-list ) `` unique '' views . 
  i believe that ** it is their right to hold such views and should not be prevented from voting the parties they believe best represent them ** . 
  the bullshit lies in how this is presented to us : the idea that people who vote for these parties are not `` true '' right wingers ; they support these parties only because of their anti-muslim immigration policies . 
  they disagree with them on everything else - allegedly . 
  the same idea was sold to us some years back when golden dawn appeared in greek mainstream politics . 
  social media was exploding with people swearing up and down that they disagreed with golden dawn , that they were not racists but ... they were forced to cast a protest vote their way . 
  but it 's been 4 years and 4 elections since then and their numbers [ have not declined one tiny bit ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/21/neo-fascist-greek-party-election-golden-dawn-third-place ) . 
  they are just as popular . 
  when [ illias kasidiaris beat up an elderly woman on live television ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nte1utrww_k ) , their numbers went up . 
  when their party leadership was arrested over the murder of an antifascist rapper [ and they even cynically accepted responsibility for it ] ( http://www.vice.com/read/golden-dawn-accepts-political-responsibility-for-murder-876 ) , their popularity increased . 
  people are not stupid . 
  voters do n't throw tantrums . 
  these people clearly identify with the far-right on an ideological level . 
  they support the majority of their policies and are eager to stick by them in their lows and highs . 
  what has simply happened is that ** it is currently socially acceptable to openly support these parties and their policies ** . 
  for many decades it was n't . 
  now it is , with political correctness having quickly collapsed , people are coming out of the ideological closet . 
  it 's that simple . 
  those people always existed . 
  why do we pretend that they vanished into thin air ? 
  please do n't insult their or our intelligence by pretending otherwise . 
   most people probably do . 
  it is very naive to believe this . 
  or , deliberate .
