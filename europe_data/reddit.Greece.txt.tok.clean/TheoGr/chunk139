  can you physically move ? 
  is there a market for you ? 
  people who migrated in the 60s to germany had it very easy . 
  today , not so much . 
  but remember that not every poor person can relocate because of practical reasons . 
   these people will in the eyes of the relative poverty statistics be forever poor and worthless which is a poisonous state of mind had to comment on this , i do n't agree with an idealist view of mankind . 
  your attitude is largely dependent on your circumstances . 
  poor people are not poor because they are lazy . 
  and i mean in general , exceptions always exist , but not for most people . 
   a ) these people need to be helped via some kind of a special intervention i agree with that only to the extent in which it works . 
  if its counter-productive , ditch it . 
   b ) the people who are more valuable in the market somehow owe these people something you owe taxes . 
  but i do n't think you personally owe directly to a poor person . 
   c ) that the advancement in the living standard is not real and does n't matter , which is wrong - none of us in the western world today probably never found themselves in a situation of starvation which would have been unthinkable a mere 150 years earlier and this is a fantastic acomplishment for our civilization . 
  the advancement really matters in that enough surplus is produced so that these people might not die . 
  they used to die in droves . 
  these accomplishments are not fantastic for you f you ca n't reliably afford the necessities of life . 
  an iphone is not a necessity . 
  so could give a poor person 10 iphones but it would n't do much for him . 
  the masks have fallen, 
  i 'm sorry , i guess you meant the creditors and not germany ? 
  ok but the point still stands . 
  ca n't really blame them . 
  also i doubt how much they could reform us without having any real control over the government or the budget - which will obviously never happen . 
   there is 0 reason to ban any cigarettes for adults public healthcare . 
  i 'm sorry but the numbers do n't lie . 
  tax in < healthcare cost . 
  it 's not about feeling better , as you mistakenly claim . 
  i do n't care if i am superior , equal or inferior intellectually to anyone . 
  all i care is that the healthcare system does not collapse because i kind of need it - i leave the ideology to you guys here to discuss all day . 
  do you have a swedish word for `` sarcasm '', 
  the government ? 
   a cbos poll from 2013 found that 75 % of poles think abortion is `` always wrong and can never be justified '' . 
  i had several angry polish users here attack me because its totally democratic since the majority supports it , yeah . 
  so its not that western europe loves regulations . 
  it 's a very liberal and free place to live . 
  it 's just that the regulations we have are sometimes based on logic and not metaphysical mumbo jumbo . 
  ah we are so authoritarian compared to you guys who want to completely [ ban abortion ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/31/polish-prime-minister-favours-ban-on-abortion ) under any circumstances . 
  got raped and the government forces you to raise the baby ? 
  no problem !, 
  but how dare we want to * dissuade * people from smoking themselves to death ? 
  we are such authoritarian monsters !, 
  found the libertarian . 
  i remember some time ago , some * freedom-loving economists * argued that poor people should not complain , because [ being poor in america is better ] ( http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/31/the-haves-and-the-have-nots/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0 ) than most parts of the world . 
  what awesome logic . 
  imagine being unemployed in greece , not knowing if you can afford rent , subsidizing on your parents ' leftovers ... but do n't complain !, 
  you still have it better than a poor villager in liberia !, 
  do n't whine !, 
  you are not poor !, 
  it 's interesting how people can close their eyes and ears to growing inequality by pretending that poverty is not `` real '' poverty . 
  it 's liberal conspiracy !, 
  and numbers and facts are liberal conspiracies too , i guess ... 
  dude please let it rest . 
  greece has a deep-rooted , profound and systemic problem with tax evasion . 
  and you blame the germans for sending only `` a couple of hundred hounds to crack down '' ? 
  this is n't anyone else 's fault , its ours . 
   after years of hesitation , the greek government accepted an offer of help from the german region of north rhine-westphalia to track down tax evaders . 
  after years of hesitation . 
  it was probably the germans ' fault too , because they did n't ask politely enough . 
  if they were more polite we would n't have hesitated so much / s, 
   there is a suspicion of ukip manipulation of online polls . 
  i 'd bet money on it . 
  golden dawn was [ absolutely killing it ] ( http://www.zougla.gr/file.ashx?fid=1143222 ) in some online polls , scoring 1st , when in reality they were barely 3rd . 
  far-right groups have very vocal , very well-connected online communities . 
  it 's funny how the anti-pc crowd was not bothered . 
  they scream stop calling us nazis in literally every discussion . 
  but when their blonde champion calls everyone else a nazi , they are nowhere to be seen . 
  do you speak on their ( emotional ) behalf ? 
  this sub is surreal sometimes . 
  your emotions are n't really an argument . 
  the majority of the french want the uk to remain . 
  of course the results can be spun with inflammatory language and clickbaity headlines . 
  are n't people allowed to comment ? 
  worst comment in this thread . 
  how can you tell eu people in an eu channel discussing a massive eu issue that ... it 's none of their business ? 
  people have a right to discuss , criticize and condemn what other countries are doing esp . 
  when it affects their own life and their future . 
   this debate has made me hate hate hate every last one if you cunts somehow i doubt you liked us before the brexit debate . 
  lets be honest here , most of you foaming-at-the-mouth anti-eu people are just looking for excuses . 
  you mean like germany , france and sweden ? 
  what do you guys imagine would be an `` awoken '' europe ? 
  what should we do to those arabs and/or muslims , not sure who you are referring to exactly but i 'm curious how you expect europe to react ? 
   so increasing wages right after elections was not catering to the masses ? 
  he did not try to properly reform the nation , he did practically nothing without foreign consent . 
  he started the memorandum which was infinitely more than anyone else has ever done in recent memory . 
  and he and his party paid a heavy price to do so . 
  they basically committed suicide . 
  but i guess conspiracy theories are more entertaining . 
   'cause the cia is idiotic compared to the genius of you or papandreou . 
  4 words : weapons of mass destruction / s but really , you just referred to a cia leak which is demonstrably wrong : they thought we would blackmail the germans . 
  we did n't . 
  hence they were wrong . 
  i do n't think anyone doubts that [ we lied to join the euro ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-16834815 ) . 
  pretty much everyone accepts it at this point , since it is [ recorded history ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_financial_audit,_2004 ) . 
  further [ audits ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_financial_audits,_2009%e2%80%9310 ) have proven the endemic nature of lying and deception in greek finances . 
   so you remember voting yes to join the euro in greece ? 
  obviously you 're not greek . 
  i do n't remember voting for many things , like having the church lord over me or being subjected to mandatory military service ( though it was n't so bad i admit ) but i endured them anyway . 
  before you downvote , consider my point that in a representative democracy you do n't get to decide for everything . 
  you have representatives for that .
