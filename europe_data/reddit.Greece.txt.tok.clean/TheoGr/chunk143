  nationality is n't a choice ? 
  i mean obviously you are born into a nationality but you can change it too . 
  fair enough . 
  so what are the up-to-date numbers ? 
  i will edit my post accordingly . 
  i think everyone went through it . 
  nationalism is just a stage that societies go through . 
  more often than not , it involves incredible amounts of violence . 
  his statement was incorrect . 
  i just read his [ source ] ( http://www.iefimerida.gr/news/266105/ti-tha-plirosoyn-oi-eleytheroi-epaggelmaties-se-foroys-eisfores ) and its nothing like that , the source is actually referring only to freelancers/self-employed people . 
  now , its widely known that [ freelancers evade taxes more than anyone else ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tax_evasion_and_corruption_in_greece ) :  there is however a correlation with the percentage of greek population that is self-employed [ 15 ] ( 31.9 % in greece vs. 15 % eu average [ 16 ] ) , as several studies [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] have shown the clear correlation between tax evasion and self-employment . 
  in reality , single greeks without children [ are taxed at almost exactly the oecd average ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26327114 ) at 25.4 % . 
  married greeks with two children are taxed a little higher at 26.7 % vs the 19.6 % average ... but that is a fucking far cry from the absurd 65 % that was mentioned . 
  our tax rates are , generally speaking , in line with the european ones . 
  on the other hand , [ we have a terrible problem with tax evasion ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/greece-struggles-to-get-citizens-to-pay-their-taxes-1424867495 ) . 
  it bothers me seeing people paint greeks as victims of extreme taxation . 
  we are not . 
  it 's misguided sympathy and karma whoring . 
  we really , really , really do n't want to pay taxes and this is the unpleasant reality that each of us needs to face - and maybe do something to change this unproductive aspect of our culture . 
  edit : lol at the last one . 
  as if . 
  yeah guess why we did n't have an industrial revolution * looks at your flair * * cough cough * edit : goddamn / s, 
   a lot of greeks feel like they ran out of choices and `` rage '' has been replaced by an almost total resignation and a docile acceptance of their fate . 
  the more the average citizen is asked to choose the more they feel like voting or choosing makes no difference . 
  the mainstream political scene is pretty much as bankrupt as the country itself and its credibility is at an all-time low , though ( what a surprise ) this results to nothing else than quiet despair and resignation . 
  we 'll probably see that in the next elections , i expect a very low turnout . 
  till then , tune in for the usual show . 
  the neo-nazi party is [ third ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/21/neo-fascist-greek-party-election-golden-dawn-third-place ) in greece . 
  this is how greeks reponded to the crisis : voting for pasok-light ( syriza ) and neo-nazi criminals . 
  also , by abstaining . 
  it 's a shit show all over . 
   to be honest , that might well be coming soon . 
  the average current sum of taxes , social security and other payments amounts to approx . 
  60-65 % of ones income in greece , depending on the proffession . 
  interesting . 
  do you have any sources on this ? 
   sure . 
  stabbing random people might very well be a tool for political action . 
   if your goal is to fight for islam as the rule of law , then yes , such attacks would be political . 
  i changed my downvotes to upvotes . 
  your comments need to be higher , for everyone to see . 
  what amazes me is the extent - nay , the * desperation * - people show in trying to push their political agenda . 
  even your own kind have given up and are deleting their comments . 
  clearly its not working out as you expected . 
  yet you continue to argue that a verifiably insane german drug addict who is stabbing random people in a tiny irrelevant town is ... * political activism for islam as the rule of law * . 
  i would recommend you quit this fool 's errand , because defending that indefensible position will only lead to more ridicule and embarrassment . 
  but then again , maybe that 's a good thing , so please continue ... 
  of course but its pretty low as far as issues as ranked by importance . 
  there are far more important things like climate change ( which kind of started the syrian civil war ) and job automation that will fundamentally disrupt our way of life . 
  its good to be aware of radical islam , the problem is when its thrust at our face as a distraction from the actual problems . 
  young males are generally angry and are driven by an irresistible urge to fuck shit up . 
  religion is just an excuse . 
  see the documentary ; they did n't really care about islam . 
  so edgy . 
  stabbing random people in a tiny bavarian city is `` fighting for islam as the rule of law '' ? 
  ah , / r/europe , you never cease to amaze me . 
  i am sure you will worry about radical islam no matter what happens . 
  being sent back is the punishment, 
  they are spreading all over the internet . 
  they can afford to post fake , disproven shit because they know they 'll get hundreds of upvotes anyway . 
  nope , nobody blamed the usual boogeyman . 
  none at all . 
  considering that they always do and in huge numbers too , its pretty bizarre . 
  anyway i offered to support my complaints with facts , but you decided to be an insulting asshole . 
  well , have fun then . 
  hello welcome to / r/europe, 
  who claimed that refugees will solve the problems of insane german drug addicts ? 
  ... insane german drug addicts ? 
  you do n't find it weird that the domineering narrative is absent in this thread ? 
  how about this , lets resume this discussion when another person gets arrested for `` offensive '' stuff , i 'll be happy to demonstrate the issue then . 
  no they are not because `` political correctness '' is always mentioned in a liberal , progressive , multiculturalism context . 
  it 's explicitly mentioned dozens and dozens of times . 
  except in one and only one thread . 
  probably because this guy is a communist . 
  you do n't find the totally different reaction absurd ? 
  just go to any thread and you will see people raging against political correctness . 
  except this one . 
  literally no one is decrying political correctness , as is the norm . 
  when [ this story ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/23/london-man-confronted-muslim-woman-explain-brussels-attacks-arrested ) broke , dozens of upvoted comments were attacking `` political correctness '' and the `` progressive liberal pc brigade '' etc. 
  what happened here ? 
  i can only imagine its because the victim is a proud , unapologetic communist . 
  why not ? 
  its a win/win . 
  they are easier to arrest and prosecute , plus the media can pretend that its an imported problem and not the native population who is rioting . 
  well its probably their taxes that are paying for the pensions , so i understand why they would riot . 
  no , please take him back in fact that should be his punishment, 
  the dutch do n't need mountains to get high, 
  i thought the sarcasm was obvious ... obviously i 'm not educating anyone just making a point . 
  where are the users decrying political correctness ? 
  its fucking amazing that none of them are screaming stop political correctness probably because this dude is a communist . 
  he is a proud communist so the usual suspects are nowhere to defend his freedom of speech . 
  on the other hand , [ that retard who harassed a woman in the street ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/23/london-man-confronted-muslim-woman-explain-brussels-attacks-arrested ) got hundreds and hundreds of supportive comments where everyone was raging against political correctness . 
  but here - silence . 
  the social engineering that goes on here is amazing sometimes . 
  let me educate you on how this shit works my friend . 
  * bad deeds of christians are attributed to `` politics '' or `` misinterpretation '' or `` he was n't a real christian anyway '' . 
  christianity had nothing to do with it , even if the perpetrators were conscious christians for all their lives . 
  * bad deeds of communists are attributed to atheists . 
  hilariously , they are attributed to the `` new atheists '' which are bourgeoise and almost apolitical . 
  * bad deeds of muslims are attributed to islam , specifically ** each and every bad deed is the direct result of a 100 % correct interpretation of islam ** .
