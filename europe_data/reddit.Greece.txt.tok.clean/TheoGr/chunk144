  you wo n't hear anyone talking about `` misinterpretation '' when it comes to muslims , no sir . 
  * bad deeds of anyone else ... who gives a shit . 
  edit : the `` let me educate you '' part was a joke , i am not educating anyone , just making a point . 
  light grey humour ? 
  you mean people consciously and maliciously lying that he was a immigrant/refugee ? 
  i like how you were proven embarrassingly wrong and now backtrack by saying * it was just a joke lol * . 
  you could ask them but people are deleting their comments so fast lol . 
  a lot of backtracking itt . 
  is n't it obvious by now ? 
  spread rage , anger and frustration . 
  destroy any discussion with toxic comments . 
  annoy people . 
  polarize the public discourse . 
  in such an environment , only a particular political group can flourish . 
  we all know who they are . 
  this kind of political animal is found in its natural habitat a.k.a. 
  / r/the _ donald as well as some other related subreddits , where it spends most of its waking hours foaming at the mouth . 
  \\ #unfortunatelyhewasntarefugee, 
  the attacker was a german named paul h. who was a drug addict and also had a history of psychiatric disorders . 
  i love how people are denying that he was german ( and even downvoting the german users who think he was ) just to shoehorn reality into their murderous raping refugee agenda . 
  sorry guys but you were wrong . 
  at least you deleted your comment because i guess you did n't want the rest to see how wrong you were . 
  better luck next time !, 
  here is a crazy thought : not all muslims are the same . 
  i know it sounds insane but its actually true . 
  germany has mostly turks that have their own cultural background . 
  ** no you did n't ** . 
  nobody said anything about crazy german shoeless drug addicts with a history of psychiatric problems . 
  all you did was scream and rage against refugees . 
  how does it feel to be wrong ? 
  there are no german muslims ? 
  wow already people are screaming * political correctness * even if the story is out for all to see . 
  ironically , it has a lot to do with [ global warming ] ( http://time.com/4024210/climate-change-migrants/ ) . 
  it 's pretty scary , depressing really , and it will only get worse . 
  but hey lets ignore that * hurr durr muslims multicultiralism leftists political correctness * are the real problems . 
   after all , if we utterly ignore the outcome of any given referendum and try to just repeat until we get the result we want i agree with the rest but not this , i do n't think that 's what happened . 
  i wrote a lengthy rebuttal [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4i1v7c/prime_ministers_listen_too_much_to_voters/d2vgmqz ) . 
  well if there is a pan-european crisis , like the one now , then brussels should have the power to handle it . 
  its a confederation so you have to expect to concede something , right ? 
  and i think each country should be free to leave if they do n't like it . 
  it should always be consensual . 
  so in that sense i do n't understand why someone would join a union and expect everything to go according to his or her plan . 
  there are others involved , which means sometimes you will be on the losing side . 
  and ok sorry i 'll change my downvote to an upvote . 
  i also did n't imply that you are racist . 
  fair points . 
  in any case , after a vote , the matter should be settled for several years at least . 
  like we could have a `` eu satisfaction referendum '' every 10 years or so . 
  just an arbitrary number but you see what i mean . 
  it is abusing even though its a democratic process . 
  we probably agree that democracy is the best system , but that does n't mean its perfect . 
  and the anti-eu folks really fucked that one up . 
  people were fucking dying in ukraine and the dutch were like * but but but animal rights !, 
  i did n't mean it to sound like an insult , like the anti-eu are stupid or something . 
  its not exactly that . 
  its just that they are way , way more vocal and determined to push their point . 
  also i downvoted because i 'm butthurt you called me fanatical . 
  but i agree you do n't have to be one to oppose federal europe , sure , its just that its more likely . 
  think of it like muslims and terrorists . 
  get it ? 
  you can see their fanaticism in the recent dutch referendum , where they basically abused the vote ( and fucked ukraine ) only to spite brussels . 
  and i 'm not fanatical though it probably seems like it . 
  he claimed to have murdered someone . 
  its not an admittance if there is no established crime . 
  there are `` confession rules '' regarding this type of thing . 
  and somehow , i trust the judge more than i trust a random angry dude on the internet . 
  i agree with everything except he is not accused of murder . 
  as far as i understood , he just claimed that he did it . 
  it 's not the same as being accused of murder . 
  if he was actually accused of murder on top of being a convicted terrorist ... yeah obviously he should be remanded . 
  but that 's not what the story says . 
  who is accused of beheading someone ? 
  the guy * said * he did it . 
  that 's all they have at the moment . 
  i do n't give two shits what happens to the guy , he might as well `` suffer a heart attack '' in his cell as far as i care ... what is strange is how incapable you are of parsing a simple news article . 
  it 's not exactly rocket science is it ? 
  and then of course the rage . 
  saying you did something is not enough to put you behind bars . 
  the crime needs to be established , like they need to find the beheaded person , and they need to prove that he did it . 
  consider that this allegedly happened in a different continent 6 years ago and you see the problem . 
  do i think he did it ? 
  sure . 
  i 'd bet money that he ( or someone in his group ) actually did it . 
  but the justice system does not work that way . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  do you think this has anything to do with peoples ' lives being actually inconvenienced ? 
  it 's all ideological . 
  the issue lies in the abstract realm of ideals where the proud national culture is under attack from islam . 
  or something like that . 
  culture , tradition , pride , nations , history , pride , etc. 
  if you think politics have anything to do with real problems , you are crazy . 
  it 's 90 % ideological . 
  sadly there is an inverse relationship between how much people give a shit about something and how much it affects their real lives . 
  you ca n't close your borders to [ climate change ] ( http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/03/150302-syria-war-climate-change-drought/ ) . 
  sure , you can do political grandstanding , closing the borders and even shooting a couple of ~ ~ refugees ~ ~ violent terrorists . 
  that might get your right-wing party elected , but you are merely prolonging the inevitable . 
  temperature does not care about man-made borders . 
  we have many shithead politicians in europe , but thankfully they do n't pretend to be `` politically incorrect '' like trump does . 
  its a small consolation but its something .
