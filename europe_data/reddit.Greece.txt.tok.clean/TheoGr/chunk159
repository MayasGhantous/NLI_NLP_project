  i do n't expect the love for `` natsoc '' ideas to die any time soon , especially if we have such a problem admitting they even exist . 
   when the whole nazi thing eventually blows over . 
  we will have colonized the galaxy before that happens, 
  i know right ? 
  they are basically repeating the holocaust / s, 
   i do n't know , a country not being able to decide how to spend its own tax revenue just does n't seem right . 
  why not ? 
  i mean , what if the country willingly and democratically enters an agreement in which we receive $ in exchange for surplus control . 
  also , we can withdraw from this or any other agreement . 
  it would indeed be very upsetting , which is why i tried to get a source out of him . 
  it 's not true . 
  we had a long discussion ( see below ) where he failed to provide evidence . 
  it 's not an obligation . 
  google `` burden of truth '' . 
  what you said was n't the truth and i stand by it . 
  you lied in order to insult people you disagree with , by implying that they somehow supported a rapist/murderer . 
  and i 'm not even surprised since this is extremely common in ( greek ) politics . 
   through which mechanism does the executive branch `` run '' greece without control of the budget ? 
  legislation without any effect on the budget is toothless legislation . 
  we control the budget . 
  maybe you meant the surplus ? 
  point is , all of this was our choice . 
  we 've had many elections since the crisis happened and we will keep having elections . 
  i trust the wisdom of the proud greek people to vote on whatever makes them happy . 
   bollocks . 
  neither a whole government nor a whole country as you often do . 
  he implied that greece is somehow run by germany . 
  good to know that people think we are their subjects or whatever . 
  and i am sorry if i offended you by being mean . 
  so instead of being a hypocrite how about trying * not * insulting greece to push your anti-eu agenda ? 
  you might find other people respecting you more . 
  but continue with this daily drama omg greece is a slave to germany and raped by schaeuble and you 'll get the answer you deserve . 
  just letting you know so that you wo n't act offended next time . 
  it did not had the defence that you mentioned . 
  hence , a lie . 
  this may surprise you but i too can speak greek . 
  and once more , the burden of proof is on you . 
  i do n't have to find anything . 
  it is my understanding that greek people think they can vote the debt away . 
  yay democracy !, 
  yes it sounds dumb , but can you really blame us ? 
  look at what other `` enlightened '' people have voted for around the world . 
  using democracy to have your debt erased is not much dumber . 
  anything is possible . 
  please stop trying to score cheap political points by insulting other countries . 
  greek people actually run greece . 
  unless you think tsipras is not democratically elected because you do n't like his politics or whatever . 
  that is not how it works bro . 
  the burden of proof is on you . 
   you are free to provide me with a video of a leftist that said something else at the time and did n't try to play down the situation . 
  no , it is not my obligation to disprove your vapid claims . 
  and this must be the craziest retort i 've read so far . 
  most interviews , including the ones in your video , do not divulge the political or ideological beliefs of the interviewee . 
  that also begs the question , how did you know they were leftists ? 
  anyway i think you are making shit up . 
  send them a pm , you might enjoy getting to know them, 
  i think you lied because nowhere in the video do we see this :  activists at the time had said that the underage afghan was the real victim because he did n't want to injure her , he only needed some money you also made me watch the video from that shitty channel twice ( fyi these \u0399\u03b4\u03b5\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 retards are national socialists . 
  i knew a guy who wrote for them and we exchanged some messages a long time ago ) so thanks for that, 
  so basically you lied when you said  however activists at the time had said that the underage afghan was the real victim because he did n't want to injure her , he only needed some money ** and he did what he did because she screamed ** . 
  only the bold part of your statement might be true . 
  and i say `` might '' because no activists were in seem in the video saying this . 
  this was his own dumb statement which was probably given to him by his desperate defense lawyer . 
  and of course it did n't work . 
  this may be the first fucking map where we actually win at something, 
  you say that as if its a bad thing, 
   however activists at the time had said that the underage afghan was the real victim because he did n't want to injure her , he only needed some money and he did what he did because she screamed . 
  this sounds like fake news from some shitty `` patriotic '' blog but i always give the benefit of the doubt so please source, 
   i know they are not that appealing , but walls kinda have proven to be effective since , say , the stone age ... can you imagine the relative density of bricks or cement , compared to water ? 
   according to some posters in here like whom ? 
   his discussion is here every day like five times . 
  at least two people have told me that we should build a wall to stop the refugees . 
  yes , a god damn wall , in the aegean sea . 
  and no they were not trolling . 
  they meant it . 
  sorry for calling you racist as well . 
   it is not gay to fuck a man , but it is gay to get fucked by a man that sounds very hellenic . 
  good for them, 
  we should rename the eu to su , or schr\u00f6dinger 's union . 
  simultaneously too incompetent to do anything ** and ** strong enough to bully sovereign nations . 
  much like schr\u00f6dinger 's immigrants : simultaneously taking our jobs while leeching welfare . 
   i 've never been called a racist , but okay . 
  strange that you complain about it then . 
  a new account , doing the typical populist shitposting in / r/politics and / r/europe from the get-go . 
  what got you banned last time ? 
   she at least has the brains to admit that the open border policy `` may '' have been a mistake . 
  she is nothing if not a cunning politician . 
  she admitted it , which is better than pretty much every other politician . 
  but you still complain . 
  it 's almost as if you ca n't do anything else . 
   sorry to have offended you , snowflake . 
  i forgive you . 
  please do n't feel white guilt over it . 
   people are incredibly reluctant to openly name this menace for fear of being branded a racist can you stop with the self-victimization ? 
  it becomes very cringey to read grown ass men crying about `` being branded a racist '' . 
  so what ? 
  somebody called you a `` racist '' online , are you going to go to counseling over it ? 
   it comes as no surprise that merkel has recently shifted her stance on the issue , as she is now flailing around trying to maintain her chancellorship . 
  hopefully it does n't work . 
  i love this criticism . 
  damned if she does something , damned if she does n't .
