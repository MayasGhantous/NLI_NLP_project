  the term `` globalization '' really means `` immigrants '' . 
  this is what it is all about . 
  nobody is actually challenging capitalism and there are no serious anti-capitalist forces in the uk or elsewhere . 
  i mean , the world did not suddenly turn communist . 
  talking about `` globalism '' is merely a rebranding of the usual anti-immigrant rhetoric . 
  no , the point is that it is allegedly `` deceptive '' . 
  one has to have an iq less than the room temperature to be `` deceived '' by a perfectly clear english statement . 
  maybe you did n't bother reading the article . 
   more than half of germans see refugees and integration as germany 's biggest problem , a survey showed on friday , despite the number of ** newcomers ** falling significantly on the year . 
  and  arrivals have slowed this year , with the federal office for migration and refugees ( bamf ) saying on friday around 305,000 ** new ** asylum seekers were registered in its ` easy ' computer system in the first 11 months of 2016 yes , it is framed it a very deceptive way , but only if you do n't know what `` new '' or `` newcomers '' means . 
  it actually confused me even more . 
  does n't matter really . 
  they are not going to do what you want them to do , so you 'll end up perpetually complaining . 
  only if its a female cat . 
  if its a male cat you are committing sin in the eyes of god, 
   the best thing muslims can do ... protesting terrorism does not run contrary to that . 
  it 's not either one or the other . 
  so an demonstration against terrorism is `` pretending your religion is perfect '' and `` using violence to force others to pretend my religion is perfect '' you are off the rails, 
   they just need to stop denying it all the time . 
  they are protesting against terrorism . 
  that was the spirit of the protests . 
  i do n't think anyone denied something , it was more like you saw the `` terrorism has no religion '' placard and went on a rant . 
  and it was a very moderate placard too . 
  it 's not like someone wrote `` islam is 100 % perfect !! '' . 
   lol , ok mate . 
  this part here is where your trolling becomes obvious . 
  since you are not a troll , please explain how you complaining about a anti-terrorist protest helps promote `` living peacefully and getting along '' . 
  truth is i could grant every point you made and you 'd still be a wrong to complain . 
  it would be in everyone 's best interest to let them have their little anti-terrorism protest . 
  it 's not a big deal anyway . 
   i do n't want an admission of guilt , i just want the muslim community to realise that islam is not perfect and is causing many problems . 
  yeah that is totally not an admission of guilt . 
  it is an admission of partial guilt , or a partial admission of guilt . 
  you chose which one . 
  i mean do you really expect them to march with with banners saying `` we are part of the problem '' ? 
  you ca n't be that dense . 
   as i said , saying terrorists are not muslims is like saying the crusaders where not christians . 
  it 's dishonest . 
  no , the the goalpost alone . 
  you were talking about `` terrorism has no religion '' . 
   i 'm saying i do n't think it helps when they deny islam is part of the issue . 
  which is true . 
  as for your last statement , i have no idea what you are implying . 
  i want everyone to live peacefully and get along . 
  this was a protest against isis and terrorism . 
  and you managed to blame for something . 
  no , you do n't want everyone to get along . 
  at least be honest and admit it - the edl folks actually admit it so i respect them for their honesty . 
  but you are not even one of them and yet you lie , 
  china has a lot of people . 
  the taiping rebellion or civil war in the 19th century had from 20 to 100 million dead , during a time when the population was significantly smaller . 
  interestingly enough , that calamity killed a bigger % of people than mao , and it was started by a [ christian cult ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taiping_heavenly_kingdom ) . 
  before you say `` so that makes it ok ? '', 
  no it does not make it ok , it just puts it into perspective . 
  and wear a fedora, 
   for the same reason we have plenty of people not interested in difficult but rewarding behaviour , we might see people converting to christianity christianity makes a lot of demands . 
  it is really not easy being a christian . 
  but i agree with the rest of your post . 
  do you even read your own sources ? 
   `` we were not able to register and control ** all ** the migrants that crossed the german border , '' but yeah , a million unverified people . 
  how many of them are verified ? 
  people are tired of experts man, 
   they 're only in deus ex yeah that is what the liberal media wants you to believe muslims are getting cybernetic implants and are threatening our biological way of life do you want another aug incident like the one in 2027 ? 
  not entirely , but he still has responsibility . 
  perception is reality . 
  if you scare people enough , they tend to view the world differently . 
   did he ? 
  brexit was achieved by the tories . 
  it was cameron 's fault . 
  well that is how politics works . 
  you take advantage of situations . 
  farage shoveled shit into the mouths of people for years . 
  it did n't make him popular , but a small group of ideologues listened to him , the ones who like that shit . 
  so he slowly established his base . 
  all he had to do was wait for an opportunity to arise . 
  the refugee crisis combined with brexit was the best opportunity he could hope for . 
  if he hand ' t shoveled all that shit , nobody would know him . 
  he would be a nobody and thus he could not have taken advantage of these situations as effectively . 
  it is actually quite smart . 
  i do admire him in a way . 
  just stick to your guns ( or your shit ) and one day you 'll get to use them , as long as you are ready . 
  alt-righters or the_donald members occasionally flood some topics . 
  they talk shit in order to get banned , on purpose , and then spend days crying about it while pretending to be victims of liberal oppression, 
  so what you are looking for is an admission of guilt . 
  that is very dishonest since you know that is not going to happen . 
  if you cared about social cohesion , you would at least ignore them . 
  but you ca n't even do that . 
  these people are telling you that they do n't believe islam supports terrorism , which is a very moderate message . 
  yet you shit on them nontheless . 
  let 's be real and admit that you do n't want the problem to be solved . 
  this situation greatly benefits you and whatever organization of `` concerned citizens '' you support . 
  you are allowed to apply for asylum even if you do n't have a visa, 
  we must be living in amazing times if the crisis of our generation does not affect society in a statistical sense . 
  by reading some of these comments you 'd think europe is in a civil war right now . 
  i see . 
  well i appreciate your honesty . 
  but i am not willing to cross the border to `` feminism is aids '' . 
  if you had a less angsty and unfunnily provocative nickname , i might attempt it . 
  it 's pretty sad that gold is needed to fight propaganda . 
  usually , posts like yours are in the middle or bottom of the page , drowned by hysteria .
