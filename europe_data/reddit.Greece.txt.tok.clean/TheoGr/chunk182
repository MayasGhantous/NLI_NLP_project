  donald trump is the demonstration of that ... they 're among the useful tools , '' the 26-year-old parliamentarian told afp on a visit to moscow . 
  no shit . 
  useful tools indeed !, 
  if you think a jewish zombie exists and also is a king , there is n't much you can say to make that statement less stupid its like believing in astrology but only in 2 zodiac signs , and claiming to be less stupid . 
  you are not . 
  you have already crossed the border to lala land, 
  you are asking the creator of the universe to bless a specific country , a country that is very wealthy and also very well armed i dont know why people think god gives a shit . 
  why would he bless any country , or america in particular ? 
  yet they keep saying it, 
  not sure if the amish had anything in common with italians, 
  it really does n't, 
  very good post . 
  just to add :  apart from the fringe radical left , the left has always embraced capitalism in the form of social market economies it was in germany where the issue [ was broached ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gotha_program ) and marx was [ forced to take a position ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/critique_of_the_gotha_program ) . 
  this was back in 1875 . 
  and when i say `` issue '' i mean how should socialists react to the unprecedented success of capitalism ? 
  some people wanted to roll with it . 
  but others did not . 
  also , this was a big topic [ during the second international ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_democracy#second_international_era.2c_.22reform_or_revolution.22_dispute.2c_1889.e2.80.931914 ) . 
  but , if i was a smug liberal ( and definitely am one ) , i 'd say that right wingers have fallen for their own propaganda . 
  they conflated all leftists with anticapitalists for decades . 
  even during obama 's term , they dismissed democrats as `` communists '' and `` marxists '' , just because they wanted national healthcare . 
   no one is saying that . 
  you must not visit reddit very often . 
  for a couple of days after the election , there were these long-winded posts everywhere , accusing liberals of being smug . 
  this is why you lost the election !, 
  you called everyone a racist !, 
  they were gilded too , and they were everywhere . 
  you still see it . 
  for example , in this thread its / u/thorbee with [ his comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5dsw4m/brexit_and_trump_have_exposed_the_lefts_crucial/da72ekq/ ) who is repeating the same point . 
  anyway it is weird you missed this because that view point dominated the internet during and after the election . 
  it still does ; try arguing with someone and even if you merely disagree with him or her you are accused of being a smug liberal who calls everyone racist ( despite not calling anyone a racist ) . 
  because they think they have the * correct * kind of identity , while others have a * wrong * one . 
  you see it even here , where nationalists are against any kind of european identity . 
  i 've seen several upvoted comments where they dismiss and even ridicule it . 
  i am always right, 
   calling rightist stupid , xenophobic , homophobic and accusing them of cheating is exactly why moderate left parties are on a decline . 
  let me give this a shot . 
  do you not think that rightists have not been insulting others ? 
  or do you think that leftists are just more `` mean '' than anyone else ? 
  either case , please give us some evidence . 
  where are the facts ? 
   they 've already lost the economic argument by adopting capitalism and privatization . 
  but this is the argument the right has been making for decades . 
  we were told how the free market is the end of history and capitalism reigned supreme . 
  communists lost . 
  yet some people still talked about income and wealth inequality , despite the odds . 
  for example , democrats talked about this , but they were viciously attacked as `` communists '' and `` marxists '' and what have you . 
  it did n't lead anywhere . 
  even obamacare was shot down because * hurr durr socialism and i do n't want my money going to lazy bums * . 
  years and years or protests and obstructionism on every level . 
  yet it was a direct attempt to regulate the free market and reign in the excesses of capitalism by redistributing wealth to those who need it . 
  but nobody would have it . 
  i am sorry , but with such an electorate what are you supposed to do ? 
  read their minds ? 
  they changed their worldview in the span of a few years , if not a few months . 
   and now everything revolves around identity politics . 
  yes it does . 
  unfortunately . 
  we are seeing the rise of `` white identity '' politics which is completely hypocritical since the same people complained about identity politics . 
  so they just created their own brand of identity . 
  fucking brilliant , i dare say . 
  what can possibly go wrong ? 
  / s  get a grip , we need a counterbalance to the rising right . 
  you ca n't easily defeat populism . 
  if you have any suggestions , go ahead and share them . 
  thank you !, 
  this is a very interesting and refreshing alternative to the typical `` liberals lost because they called us racist '' nonsense that is spreading like wildfire . 
  no , more nationalism is always the answer . 
   this is just what you want to believe . 
  that is history . 
  all christian countries have been run based on their politics , until very recently . 
  i never thought i 'd talk to someone who denies ~ 1700 years of very well documented history about what christians did in their countries ... but there is always a first . 
   the point is that christianity and an open liberal democratic society and values are not as completely antithetical as islam is . 
  was that the point ? 
  my point was that you brought up a jesus quote to argue that christianity is not a `` total package of a political , social and legal system '' . 
  it totally is . 
  since the 3rd century ce , they have been doing just that . 
  the fact that they stopped being so political was n't due to the nature of their religion ; it was because they lost to people like me . 
  progressives . 
  all in all , you can argue that islam is worse without re-writing history and pushing blatantly wrong viewpoints . 
  you do n't have to do that . 
  islam gives you enough ammunition without requiring to resort to propaganda . 
  of course my post will fall on deaf ears , in which case , just take a look at mike pence 's term to see how much `` rendering onto caesar '' will happen . 
  yes , these `` concerned citizens '' are merely defending `` their '' women by throwing rocks and firebombs at the refugee camp . 
  that is greek self-defense 101 . 
  one day someone looked at my girl the wrong way , i took a flamethrower to his house while his family was inside / s i wonder if people actually believe this or are just conscientiously ( and cynically ) pushing a fake narrative to suit their agenda . 
   it all started on wednesday night where a group of refugees broke into a store and stole fireworks source ? 
  all i find on the internet ( [ 1 ] ( https://kostoday.com/%ce%b5%ce%bb%ce%bb%ce%ac%ce%b4%ce%b1/xios-polemos-me-molotof,-ksylodarmoys,-zimies-kai-traymaties-epeisodia-kai-xaos-sti-soyda-vinteo ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.newsit.gr/topikes-eidhseis/xios-polemos-me-molotof-ksylodarmoys-zimies-kai-traymaties-epeisodia-kai-xaos-sti-soyda-vids/677988 ) ) is that it started when the refugee camps got `` mysteriously '' firebombed . 
  they are allowed despite christianity , very recently , and after a lot of hard-fought battles . 
  you ca n't just ignore history to suit your narrative . 
  that would be true if christianity was not everywhere in politics . 
  what about caesar when they do n't respect the secular laws that allow abortion ? 
  or gay marriage ? 
  it sounds great in theory but we never see it in action, 
   because i gave you an answer , yet you do nothing with it i do n't buy your answer . 
  you know why ? 
  because nationalists have said exactly the same thing you 're saying and it has been proven to be wrong . 
  everyone not agreeing with you is a `` self-hater '' . 
  the media is unfairly promoting the liberals . 
  it 's always the same things .
