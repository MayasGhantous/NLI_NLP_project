  woman had to enter the workforce because wages stagnated over the last decades . 
  households needed more money . 
  a man 's wage was objectively not enough anymore , for the majority of the `` middle class '' i mean . 
  i 've seen it happen in me parents generation and its brutal . 
  guess what , woman got the shaft of it , as usual . 
  they were expected to be mothers and homecleaners but now they have to work too , if they did n't want their families ' quality of life to massively decrease . 
  today not much has changed expect that we started respecting them and not demanding them adopt a contradictory role . 
  when in doubt , blame feminism . 
  reality , on the other hand , tells us : * people do n't want to have kids * as much * as they used to . 
  why ? 
  because they are not forced to anymore . 
  do n't get me wrong , the majority of people still want to have kids and that wo n't change . 
  its just that the percentage has dropped . 
  * the economy sucks . 
  its very difficult to be a parent if both partners have to work in shitty jobs with no job security . 
  the invisible hand of the market took care of that . 
  * this culture that existed a long time ago - breed a dozen kids , some will survive , they 'll help in the farm or in the mine , and the few that make it to adulthood will repeat the process - is not compatible with our modern technological world where human wellbeing is treasured . 
  you 'd have to revert the whole basis of our society , in order to largely increase the population in 1st world developed nations . 
  some people imagine that by destroying feminism all will go return to the magical good ol' days , but that 's not gon na happen my friend . 
  you will just divide society more by denying women their rights . 
  its not a solution and i do n't see it happening . 
   but do n't you think that events like cologne should give reason for pause ? 
  pause for what ? 
  for debate ? 
  sure . 
  but if you think you are likely to get raped by visiting cologne you are insane or ( even worse ) pushing a specific agenda . 
  that is the whole point of this incessant fearmongering , terrorizing and aggressively attacking any opposition . 
  europe is being destroyed !, 
  if you disagree you are a traitor . 
  the more you shit on your minorities , the less they care about what you think of them . 
  sweden is not collapsing . 
  to leave the country ( taking with you your parents and fellow country-members investment in you ) on such basis is the actual religious cultism . 
  millions would ** risk death ** to have the standard of living he or she not only takes for granted , but spits upon . 
  did someone actually call you a nazi or were people just disagreeing with you ? 
  you mean productive conversations like complaining ad nauseum you are victimized by being called a `` nazi '' or `` racist '' ? 
  just look at this topic ( and all of them in / r/europe ) and you will find 0 conversations destroyed this way . 
  go on , find one if you can . 
  its just self-victimization . 
  i feel bad for the brits , a german woman going over there and hugging them . 
  its like first they had to endure the the blitz and now this ? 
  i do n't think it set any such definition . 
  i do n't think people on earth can be unified as one either . 
  that is too utopian for me . 
  but acting like tribalism has any relevance today is insane . 
  much to the annoyance and even dispair conservatives ( rather , a certain sub-group of them ) tribalism and other base biological urges have been successfully overcome - with excellent results . 
  are you saying this because of the eldorado gold clusterfuck in halkidiki ? 
  come on man . 
  the greek state is just as guilty , if not more . 
  and its not like the `` natives '' would have done anything with their mineral resources , their lives revolve around ripping-off tourists and shit . 
  let the canadians have it , so that maybe the locals can enjoy some wages , while the opportunity is still there . 
  its cool , i understand you mean well . 
  but why would you be surprised ? 
  greece is a pretty new country , its not like we are experts in democratic institutions . 
  but lets not start with political semantics . 
  do n't you have the same ( proportionally speaking ) say as everyone else has ? 
  or am i missing something ? 
  your participation is just as democratic as everyone else 's , or ? 
   we never win any votes we disagree to . 
  never . 
  yeah its called democracy . 
  you have a say , its just that everyone disagrees with it . 
  try sending a non-buffoon to represent your country next time . 
  do n't get me wrong , you have the right to complain about the shitty situation you found ( or put ) yourselves into . 
  you are right to be bothered by it and i can see why you want to leave . 
  but do n't pretend its not democratic with all this `` eu is fascist '' nonsense . 
  lets be honest here . 
  you played the game and you lost . 
  did n't mean to strawman you bro . 
  do n't you have 73 seats in the eu parliament ? 
  i think you totally have a say . 
  but you wasted it by shipping over a buffoon ( guess who i am referring to ) to represent your country . 
   do they not make good immigrants ? 
  of course they do . 
  they are known to work super hard . 
  i did n't mean to come off like i was insulting them . 
  right wingers shat on them , as they shat on every group until the next wave came along . 
  unsurprisingly , western civilization is still here . 
   read : ` the tribes are now nations , not ethnic groups or religions . ', 
  who takes that seriously anymore ? 
  in the developed world i mean . 
  except you . 
  and no , tribes are not nations nor are nations tribes . 
  nations are nations , tribes are tribes . 
  you can even use google if you do n't believe me . 
  they are not the same thing , because in some parts of the world tribes are still a thing in the middle east , the americas , oceania , etc. 
   the history of greece , and every other square inch of land on this earth , proves the biological basis for tribalism . 
  different groups of humans with different social groups , and different ideologies , histories and customs , conflict with each other you mean join one another . 
  of course there is conflict , but conflict is in everything . 
  in the end the groups join . 
  if you want i can recommend some greek history books literally no-one ( besides you ? ), 
  thinks tribalism is a thing anymore . 
  maybe except some amazonian tribes , i dunno, 
  if you are looking for perfection then you are in the wrong planet my friend just because it has , according to some people , too many muslims , does not mean its a madmax caliphate . 
  still one of the best places to live in the planet , so hearing our bulgarian user here lecturing us how sweden is being destroyed is in bad taste , do n't you think ? 
  maybe they 'll give a pig, 
  you need to understand that people disagreeing with you ** does not ** indicate a lack of democracy . 
  the sooner you realize how democracy works the sooner your side might become relevant again . 
  but now its like you show up at a club , insult everyone , abstain , trash-talk and agitate people ... and then complain why you do n't have the power to influence the club 's course . 
  i mean come on now . 
  it sounds like you are annoyed that people are more talkative to one another ... * ah the good ol' days , you could just go out and get something going with a stranger girl without all this modern `` talking '' stuff * / s,
