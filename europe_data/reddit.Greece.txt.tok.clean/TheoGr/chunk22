  ** obviously everyone has a right to say whatever he or she wants ** but you see how it distorts reality do n't you ? 
  they do n't confuse anything . 
  its just that muslims and/or refugees are involved so it pays well to talk about 1000s of rapes , in order to push a specific agenda . 
  i bet that if there were no muslims or refugees involved , we 'd be hearing about feminists overreacting etc. 
  yours is a harsh , even cynical , yet ultimately true observation . 
  feminists receive enormous amount of hate for doing the same thing i.e. 
  misusing rape terminology to push their agenda . 
  but when muslims are involved , somehow its not a big deal at all ? 
  i find this to be a double standard . 
  well i am happy i agree with someone on this subject . 
  we invented democracy so we get to apply a double standard heck we probably invented double standards too , so there you go, 
  so germany takes the `` raw materials '' from europe , labor included , applies its technology and expertise , and then sells the end-product for a profit . 
  correct me if i am wrong but is n't this how capitalism works ? 
  you buy stuff from others ( time , materials , knowledge ) and sell their unique combination for more than what you bought them for . 
  are the counter-arguments coming from a communist perspective ? 
  honest question . 
  i understand this might be unfair and i am all ears for arguments against it , but its weird to see people shocked by this . 
  this is how the whole planet operates . 
  this has been going on for a long time now . 
  i do n't think its by any means a scandal . 
  when you go to work every day , this is what happens . 
  i told you to look up the legislation , but let me help some more :  abortions can be performed on-demand in hospitals for women whose pregnancies have not exceeded twelve weeks . 
  [ 2 ] in the case of rape or incest , an abortion can occur as late as nineteen weeks , and as late as twenty-four weeks in the case of fetal abnormalities this is for greece . 
  you are entitled to rights after the first 12-24 weeks of your existence . 
  i agree . 
  being afraid to be called a `` nazi '' is the epitome of cowardice and self-loathing . 
  yes , because its not a baby when you abort it . 
  that is what all civilized societies have decided , look up the relevant legislation if you do n't believe me . 
  also , bring on the downvotes . 
  abortion is , and will remain , legal . 
  deal with it , 
  thanks for that , i stand corrected . 
  agreed , that goes both ways though . 
  it might be a dealbreaker for the woman to not be trusted not being a slut . 
  which is why its cowardly to secretly do it or wait for her to become pregnant and then ask , which is way too late . 
  so you are saying that the men in the statistic made the * right * choice ? 
  lol . 
  trust is the opposite of having to verify . 
  ~ ~ no need to abuse the english languge ~ ~ . 
  if someone is having doubts about his partner capacity to keep her legs closed , he should be honest about it and save himself a failed marriage , alimony , etc. 
   and if she says `` do n't you trust me ? '', 
  you say `` sure , that 's why i do it : i like to hear good news '' . 
  that is not honesty , that is an orwellian level of doublespeak . 
  if you trust her its not `` good '' news , its not even news at all since you said you trusted her . 
  its something you already know since you trust her . 
  why not just be honest and tell her how much of a big deal this is to you ? 
  i imagine many women would agree to that . 
  instead of being sneaky about it . 
  you mean the alleged perpetrator of the fraud . 
  i ca n't imagine how people think its ok to secretly test their kids for things like this ? 
  surely the kid is entrusted to both parents and one of them ( male or female ) ca n't just do whatever he or she wants with it ? 
   but surely a world in which the barriers to communication have been minimized is preferable . 
  not always . 
  you can have more power over a local population if you limit its communication with the outer world . 
  also , you can easily spread propaganda about other countries or cultures ( think ww1 ) if people can not communicate at a personal level . 
  so from a politician 's point of view , having barriers to communication is worthwhile . 
  agenda pushing . 
  people used to get their knickers twisted over homosexuals which are a small % too ... even if their existence did not affect their lives one tiny bit . 
  i do n't believe you . 
  i 've never heard of this `` london '' you speak of . 
  who would make up such a stupid name anyway . 
  i do n't know what the law says in every country but they should be illegal unless ** both ** the parents agree . 
  your kid is not your property . 
  it is a human being with certain rights . 
  also , its mother has some rights as well , you ca n't do anything you want with a newly born without involving the mother or the law ( something that every adult should understand by now ) . 
  kids are not the property of their male parents . 
  umm no . 
  its up to each couple to decide if they can trust one another , not the government . 
  that 's what i asked . 
  you are getting downvoted too . 
  why would someone want to bring a child in this world with someone he thinks might be a cheating whore ? 
  lack of partners ? 
  trauma from previous betrayals ? 
  i am not dissing them i just honestly do n't get it . 
  why would you want to raise a child with someone you do n't trust at all ? 
  not criticizing you man , obviously you have the right to ask anything you want , i just find your statement ( and the # of people who agree with you ) extremely strange . 
   he added that the research debunked sexist social stereotypes that heterosexual women feel an evolutionary imperative to have multiple male partners to increase fertility rates but do not inform the partners , to avoid confrontation . 
  is that an existing stereotype or is he making things up ? 
  what kind of weird shit is that . 
  i 've heard a lot of sexist stereotypes but nothing quite like this . 
   it 's really a cultural thing over there , is n't it ? 
  yes it is . 
  i grew up in a small town , there are good historical and economical reasons to have this attitude , its not just people being evil . 
  but i agree with you animals should have rights . 
  its just that humans should come first . 
  if you think a cow is more important than the ukrainians who want a non-corrupt european country ( and died trying to get it ) , you should be medically examined and possibly medicated . 
  its not healthy . 
  yes . 
  the greek one was literally mass delusion . 
  but as you said , no innocents were harmed . 
  but the dutch one fucked the ukrainians over for no good reason . 
  i could n't have said it better . 
  so two wrongs make a right ? 
  or is it wrong when the eu does it , but good when putin does it ? 
  because that 's what it sounds like . 
   many people here claim that all they did was make it an anti-eu vote , which is demonstrably false . 
  are you sure ? 
  i ca n't read dutch but many people here are saying that the no-camp explicitly said this was the case : they did n't care about ukraine they just wanted to flip the bird to brussels, 
  imagine if your grandfathers said that before shipping off to fight in europe, 
  i meant your country , sorry for the confusion .
