  that was a fancy way to say : * i am wrong , but lack the dignity to admit it . 
  i know you hoped for a long rant about how the politically correct regressive left is destroying europe and the proud white nations , but i decided to post something more honest . 
   the barbaric lands of south italy . 
  interesting . 
  i would have expected something similar to greece , where if you express your atheism , you will be shunned by many people who do n't share your views . 
  it seems you were wrong . 
  no , it was an admittedly humorous attempt to brush off people like you who , immediately , get angry against mooslims without looking who staged this exhibition and why . 
  oh and to complain about political correctness , as usual . 
  you forgot to complain that they call you `` racist '' and `` nazi '' , in an attempt to shut down your proud patriotic voice . 
  lets not forget that . 
  does n't matter to him . 
  the goal of / u/a _ hamilton was to get his message as high as he could , so that people could join the anti-left circlejerk once more . 
  how does it go ? 
  throw enough mud at the wall , some of it will stick ? 
  works great . 
  any evidence or just the usual shitposting ? 
   the venue is home to a theatre group whose artistic leader , christian lollike , courted controversy in 2012 by staging a play based on the manifesto of norwegian mass killer anders behring breivik . 
  oh no , its the right !, 
  the right-wingers did this !!!, 
   it should n't seem absurd to anyone that canada is willing to defend europe , even when europe is not willing to defend itself . 
  its always easier to call for war if its your professional , highly trained forces that go to fight . 
  they signed up for it , after all . 
  and if they lose , you get to hear about it on tv . 
  then you move on with your life . 
  different story in europe . 
  most of us are will be/are/have been conscripted and the price for losing a war is , besides dying , seeing your house and family destroyed . 
  something that you have not and will not experience . 
  so its a very different story . 
  and instead of making it a dick-measuring contest try to understand why some people are not so eager to join a war , instead of implying they are cowards or whatever . 
  are you reading a different sub ? 
  western europe is portrayed in a comically bad fashion . 
  its a host of decadent , weak countries that are ruled by progressive pc leftists ( even merkel 's cdu is leftist , yeah ) politicians who are hell-bent on destroying the proud white nations by importing these fake refugees . 
  they hate white men , they hate traditions , they hate the family , they hate babies and also they want to imprison anyone who speaks ill of their muslims . 
  but their money ... their money is good , yeah . 
  we 'll take that . 
  while complaining about it . 
  anyway this is the dominant narrative and you can see this is most discussions . 
  it was n't always this bad , but the excessive trolling & shitposting of the past months has broken this sub . 
  and maybe field your own [ regiments ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hellenic_force_in_cyprus ) as well ? 
  or is help from abroad `` bad '' only when it comes from germans, 
  so , basically what i said . 
  use the wrong words and you are disqualified . 
  how does it feel to be pc ? 
  must be awesome right ? 
  especially if you get to use it to your advantage, 
   but for laws we had to wait for romans , and we needed judeo christianity for our monotheist religion . 
  really , western civilization , in it 's fullest form , began after fall of roman empire and split of christianity . 
  according to whom ? 
  this sounds awfully convenient , like ignoring any non-christian history , before or after the christian times . 
   all of those wars were happening under renaissance , oh so beloved period that many people think it was much better then meddle ages . 
  really , it was protestantism fault , religion was used for political reasons , remember , at that time modern political philosophy was born . 
  i know . 
  with christianity , its never the religion . 
  its always politics . 
   it was a good reason for them , you just ca n't understand it . 
  for example , my great grand parents and grand parents are/were patriots , they wanted their country to be free , and in turn themselves to be free . 
  nationalism gave democracy and sovereignty over their destiny to small nations . 
  and it caused a lot of senseless killing . 
  not everyone can be defending his country , can they ? 
  somebody has to do the attacking . 
  i know , `` you are not an atheist but '' , i should be more respectful of magic . 
  after all what matters in an argument is how much respect you show towards christians and if you use the `` wrong '' words you are disqualified as a neckbeard . 
  was your post sarcastic and i missed it ? 
  she is not a feminist nor claimed to be one , and her party is [ specifically against it ] ( http://www.thelocal.de/20140331/german-anti-euro-party-afd-turns-anti-feminist-alternative-for-germany-facebook ) . 
  i ca n't imagine how you thought she would be `` ok '' with that . 
  maybe this is some kind of new / r/europe angle here , to pretend that she supports feminism now ? 
  and i 'm sure a feminist such as yourself would be fine with an anti-abortion party . 
  you both should be deported for not integrating . 
  that 's good enough , i guess !, 
   disagree , it united most of it , it really allowed to western civilization exist in the first place you assert stuff that does not exist in recorded history . 
  western civilization is widely understood to have started in classical greece , when no zombie worshiping cult existed there . 
  christianity never united anything , i mean you even had the catholics launch [ crusades against the people in your area ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_crusades ) . 
  there are [ so many terrible shortcomings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_wars_of_religion ) of this religion to unite us . 
  it even [ destroyed the original eastern christianity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_constantinople ) as i pointed out earlier . 
  no unification , only war . 
   oh , and i might add that people should despise nationalism less people should despise progressivism less because it allows you to peacefully sit here and discuss with me instead of dying for `` god , king and country '' as millions and millions of your ancestors did for no good reason - before we got our shit together . 
  the ideology that promotes it is not so strong here . 
  not strong at all , really . 
  but i think i already said that ? 
   there are some very poor regions in turkey ( particularly the eastern part ) ** where unemployment is over 20 % ** . 
  not even a little impressed if your fears were true then literally all of greece would have flocked to germany by now, 
   would have been quicker & probably cheaper to fire everyone involved and knock the fucker down and start from scratch after the scandal first broke . 
  very true . 
  but keep in mind that this short-sightedness is why we have this mismanagement to begin with . 
  politicians propose overly optimistic budgets in order to get their plans approved . 
  the alternative , like telling the truth as to how much something actually costs , would be deemed unacceptable . 
  if someone came ahead and proposed an airport like ber with its actual cost , he or she would have been instantly dismissed . 
  so everybody has to lie and pretend things are cheaper & easier than they actually are , in order to get their plans approved . 
  its a shitty situation and germany has fallen into it again and again . 
  [ take a look at all the shit they 've fucked up ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/disastrous-public-works-projects-in-germany-a-876856.html ) . 
   christianity was first `` eu '' in a way :d not if you were eastern orthodox , in which case christianity would just [ kill and burn you for a couple of days ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_constantinople_ ( 1204 ) . 
  christianity did n't really unite europe , ever . 
  we had to suffer two world wars based on extreme nationalism , in order to get our shit together . 
  so the more we moved away from our old order roots , the more those european values started to exist ( if they exist at all ) . 
  i mean the abstract idea of a perfectly free market that is promoted by said ideology . 
  and while our discussion might be interesting , i think we are off-topic . 
   the privacy-max vs privacy-min society argument will be made eventually , i 'm sure of it , but i think the solution is to create a firm public/private space divide using technical solutions and some new organizational rules ( like making a special legal structure for things like facebook ) rather than going to either extreme . 
  this is interesting but how do you see it being made ? 
  something must change , but what ? 
  personally i do n't see it happening even in a thousand years .
