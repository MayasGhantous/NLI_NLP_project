  nobody could have said it better . 
  the muslim minority might be vocal , annoying and generally douchey , but they stand no chance of upsetting the power structures . 
  so while police obviously needs to pay more attention , this is n't a danger to our european way of life . 
  it might become a danger to our way of life , only if native extremists ( left or right ) become involved ; and unfortunately they are , in ever-increasing angrier fashion . 
  i bet this will get downvoted to oblivion . 
  why ? 
  because it does n't fit the oppressed-yet-proud-white-nationalist-male narrative . 
  i bet a lot of people are sad that he did n't get charged . 
  i , for one , am happy he is free . 
  he is a massive asshole , but that is not illegal . 
  good day to you too sir . 
  i am pleasantly surprised by your reasonable response . 
  last time i was discussing something about the ohi day , the guy got insanely angry , i got a bunch of personal im threats . 
  so here 's to being cool . 
  the concrete benefit to people ( like me ) would be to do things the proper way . 
  i like that , i am weird that way . 
  traditions change all the time , especially greek ones , probably have changed more than any others ( considering we go back many millenia ) . 
  i do n't think greek people are dumb enough to be confused by this . 
  but maybe they are ? 
  thinking about greek people , yeah , maybe a date change would be enough to short-circuit our brains , i kind of see your point . 
  so because it was a good fit two centuries ago means we have to keep doing it ? 
  sounds like a bad reason to do anything really . 
  how about doing what is right and logical ? 
  as a nation , we should really try to do that one in a while . 
  turkey 's unemployment rate : ** 10.1 % ** greece 's unemployment rate : ** 25.6 % ** turkey 's gdp growth : ** +4.1 % ** greece 's gdp growth : ** -3.3 % ** when do we admit we made a mistake with the whole revolution crap ? 
  edit : yeah i should have added a ** / s **, 
  thanks but the us actually repressed communists ( or any dissident ) during the cold war . 
  i know it sounds crazy but i 'm not making it up . 
  you could n't be a communist or hold communist views , the government would really try to fuck your life up . 
  what if someone wanted to be a communist ? 
  remember what happened last time , i.e. 
  this is just bs your government tells you to keep you content . 
  the moment your `` freedom of expression '' threatens your establishment , you 'll see how little your rights matter . 
   innocently ? 
  he was n't looking for a refresher course in brussels 101 i was being sarcastic . 
  because people here ( including yourself ) are pushing the idea that he just asked a stranger a question . 
  that is wrong and misleading . 
   because from where i stand , those sentences read like the sarcastic hand-waving of a person who thinks this is acceptable , and not really a big deal . 
  allright , thanks for letting me know what my post reads like to you . 
   you heard it here first , folks , humans do n't have human rights !, 
  sorry but i have a one strawman policy per person , so do n't expect any more discussion atm . 
   if you want to argue that rights are man made and not god given , fine , i 'd agree with you good , at least we agree on something !, 
   lol , dat butthurt . 
  look , i 'm not going to stand here and pretend that the war on drugs is some awesome shit , but you tell me what 's scarier , here ; being locked up because you became heavily involved with drugs , or being locked up because you hurt someones feelings over twitter . 
  sorry son , but that 's a no-brainer . 
  what is scarier is living in a country with the incarceration rate of usa , regardless of your feelings towards `` free speech '' . 
  but maybe europe is scarier for you because you enjoy harassing people in the street and ( more importantly ) on social media as well , especially right after a mass murder ? 
  if you are that kind of person i see your point , but not everyone is that kind of person . 
  not everyone regards that behavior to be important enough . 
  also i do n't know what else to say after the brilliant rebuttal '' `` lol , dat butthurt '' . 
  i think that seals the deal   sorry , but i 'm willing to file tzatziki sauce vs. mayonnaise under `` cultural differences '' , not the erosion of human rights . 
  you would be surprised to learn that your `` philosophical '' views on rights etc are indeed cultural . 
  culture is not only about eating sauces . 
  there is so much more to it . 
  for example your frustration over this ( despite living in a far more authoritarian society ) is a direct result of your cultural upbringing . 
  i feel the same way when it comes to americans and their guns too , but i understand its a cultural thing . 
  in its core , its a simple concept : the effect of people 's words can cause seriously damage your life . 
  i 'm not talking about `` feelings '' or `` emotions '' , but your objective quality of life . 
  of course this does not refer to random assholes talking shit on the street . 
  this `` speech '' needs to be deliberate , targeted , organized and large enough in scope . 
  such verbal attacks can literally ruin your life , people lose their jobs , commit suicide , you name it . 
  i 'm sure you know of this because liberals do this too ; the results can be devastating . 
  and when it goes along racial or `` racial '' lines , the stability of society is threatened . 
  which is why the government steps in . 
  please do n't take this as an argument supporting said law . 
  i 'm more like trying to explain the rationale behind it . 
  and calling someone a `` fascist '' is n't hate speech . 
  its an actual political position . 
  there are a lot of people proudly proclaiming to be one . 
  i 've met dozen golden dawn members claiming to be one . 
  funny how people play the victim once its their ass on the line . 
  the guy was perfectly fine harassing random people , but when * he * receives harassment he is suddenly a poor victim . 
  innocently asking someone to `` explain brussels '' ( like they were buddies who casually met in the street and chatted ) and going off on an fit of internet anti-muslim rage is not the same thing really . 
  as i said you can argue that he should n't be arrested but no need to pretend he asked an innocent question . 
  also there is no `` human '' right of free speech . 
  your american government decides the limits of free speech , just as european governments do . 
  i understand you think you have more freedom but your insane incarceration rate proves you otherwise . 
  as you said below , this should be filed under `` cultural differences '' . 
  no , i am just explaining how being an asshole has extra ramifications to just being an asshole . 
  the whole `` inciting hatred '' part . 
  it can lead to some serious violence and harassment . 
  this is not news , we know this happens , the controversial topic is whether the want laws to protect us from this kind of harm or not . 
  i see what you are saying . 
  maybe they do have a point . 
  but maybe they do n't . 
  the fact that an opinion is a majority does not mean its correct , however . 
  this is a basic concept of logic . 
  good post . 
  unfortunately many laws use the term `` race '' or `` racial '' which leads to much confusion . 
  the article itself said `` inciting racial hatred '' and that is where i got the term from . 
  allright . 
  do you think there is a case where `` racial hatred '' is used properly ? 
  like do we even have racial hatred anymore or is it always a political term that the spoiled generation uses ? 
  honest question . 
  in the part where it said that he was ranting on social media about her ? 
  that is was caused his arrest , right ? 
  did you even read the article ? 
  again ( i am sorry but we need to go through this several times ) its perfectly reasonable to be against legislation that prevents him from doing so . 
  but no need to pretend he was innocently `` talking about stuff '' . 
  since english is n't your first language too , you should know that `` answering for crimes '' is not used literally .
