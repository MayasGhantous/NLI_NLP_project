  yeah , because without the immigrants people are unionizing , right ? 
  this is ridiculous , the working class is long dead ( since decades ) and yet you somehow found a way to blame this too on the immigrants . 
  what a joke . 
  yeah i 'm pretty sure he molested a bunch of babies . 
  i mean he scribbled on the walls of a university campus , something that nobody has done before . 
  a man capable of doing that can is capable of everything . 
  lock your children . 
  those refugees do n't respect our proud democratic progressive sensitivities !, 
  i agree that the core of conservatism ( or the right ) sounds like some insane military manifesto . 
  that is because , in its core , it is . 
  the thing is even simpler : for centuries religious people ( muslim and christians ) have brutally murdered homosexuals . 
  they did this in ways you ca n't even imagine - it was that brutal . 
  when religion took a back seat in society , this slowly stopped happening . 
  yet now you want to tell us that christianity teaches you to respect gay people . 
  sure . 
  lets ignore historical reality in the name of religion , what can possibly go wrong ? 
  i am now expecting the inevitable counter-argument : oh but it was n't real christians who did that !, 
  they were n't real ones !, 
  contrast that to every muslim who is always 100 % a real muslim and they never misinterpret their texts . 
  sure , like worshiping ( sometimes literally ) the traditions of your ancestors , glorifying any kind of `` traditional '' family structure , shaming and shunning and abusing any other kind of family structure ( or lack of one ) , being religious or respecting religion even if they are atheist/secular , believing in fixed gender roles , supporting or respecting nationalism , being against homosexuality , slut shaming , sex needs to be controlled , too much sex is a bad thing , `` wrong '' kinds of sex can ruin society , basically believing in moral hazards , being pro-military , longing for the past , many more , this is just off the top of my head . 
  basically change the name of their god and they are almost identical . 
  its one of the things i utterly fail to understand about right wingers as well . 
  they call those homophobic people `` uncivilized '' but they share most of their views . 
  the right should be happy at this , yet they are against it . 
  seriously , literally every other time gays are mentioned , they are against them . 
  except when it comes to muslims ( or brown people in general ) , then the right does a magical 180 . 
  this magazine cover is racist . 
  why is europa blonde ? 
  this is a generation that grew up in totally sheltered conditions . 
  the people who complain about europe being on the brink of disaster do n't really know what their countries have been through in the past and how incredibly good they have it now . 
  i am greek and i too can say that the eu years ( before the crisis ) were quite good . 
  they gave us an incredible amount of money . 
  that money was , of course , wasted . 
  now people are mad . 
  that 's strange because i 've never heard any of that around here 99 % its rabid anger against merkel , who is to blame for everything wrong with eastern europeans ( and southern , and western , and northern , etc ) . 
  but i guess everyone likes to play the victim so i see where you are coming from, 
  i am set because i do n't see any non-ideological counter-argument . 
  there is no collision between germany and greece * to the extent that would make the complete pillage of greece a reasonable or even desirable course of action * . 
  you take all this for granted and start building your argument from there onwards . 
  i do n't . 
  sadly most of greece shares your view , making any cooperation impossible . 
  the current greek government even threatened germany with refugees , as if they are some kind of weapon . 
  this is embarrassing . 
  once more , its in your self interest to have healthy neighbors whom you cooperate with . 
  its ** not ** in your self interest to fuck everyone around you . 
  i think most of the anti-eu points here come from some ideological viewpoint , so i ca n't say anything more on the matter . 
  the misinformation here is worrying . 
  in reality , what the `` safe zone '' refers to is a `` security checkpoint '' where women can get immediate help and attention . 
  all the top comments here are how women are going to remain in their own `` safe zones '' , as if this is some kind of segregation . 
  i understand that people are angry about the cologne new year attacks ( and they should be ) but you ca n't let your anger lead you to misinformation . 
  tl/dr ; nobody is segregating women . 
  this `` safe zone '' is a mechanism form them to get help faster and more efficiently . 
  edit : syntax, 
  i doubt it , i think you severely overestimate the economy of greece . 
  it does n't matter , because obviously this whole discussion is ** ideological ** and not financial . 
  some people simply do n't want the eu period . 
  reality be damned . 
  look at this thread here , the top commentator here has not given evidence for his opinion , even when asked to do so . 
  its sad because in these cases i.e. 
  border control , a stronger eu would benefit greece . 
  but we do n't want eu help and refuse to get on board . 
  ok i see but i am talking about greece and germany and not nigeria . 
  so basically your evidence is an article that says  the european court of human rights has ruled that greece 's asylum system is inadequate and degrading . 
  and  due to growing international pressure , greece has begun to overhaul its asylum system . 
  are you sure you 've read it ? 
  nowhere does it say that greece or italy asked for help and the eu ignored them . 
  what is obvious by both your article and reality is that * greece fucked up * . 
  i would n't expect the european comission to keep silent about it , just because people might be offended . 
   yes that 's why we 're helping developing countries since humanity would be better off , instead of pillaging them for their resources . 
  but germany prefers to pillage greece for their resources ? 
  because ... greek suffering is one-step removed from them ? 
  no , pillaging a member state in your own union is not in your best interest and they are not removed from the suffering at all . 
  greece being in this wretched state affects everyone . 
  can you please provide evidence for this ? 
   we would n't have been , a crisis was inevitable . 
  the exact timing may have changed , but that would have been about it . 
  yeah i agree that crises are inevitable . 
  the point remains , that it was the crisis that was to blame for greece and not the eu . 
  other nations were hit by the crisis too , yet they made it . 
  we did n't . 
  because we suck . 
  i know this will end up getting downvoted because its not a polite thing to say about a country . 
  but it seems to me to be the truth . 
  also i am greek myself , if that matters . 
   i agree but the world does not function as per this enlightened idea . 
  it totally does . 
  that is why the robber-murderers you mentioned are an extreme minority . 
  but you think its perfectly normal for people to behave this way , as if its not a majorly disadvantageous way of living . 
  same goes for developed , 1st world countries . 
   that 's the problem with the euro - it 's an unsustainable system , and that 's all we 've been observing over the past decade . 
  that it ca n't work . 
  a financial crisis hit the planet around 2008 . 
  if that had n't happened , we would be singing a different tune now . 
  but now you are shifting the blame to the eu , as if greeks never had a chance , as if they did not fuck it up for themselves . 
  i do n't know about other countries but greece clearly did not give the eu a chance . 
  we lied to enter it , our economy collapsed because of the 2008 crisis and then started demanding money from the eu . 
  and we are unpleasant about it too , like we make angry demands and then threats if we are not showered with money and attention ( the greeks invented everything !, 
  they are the best always ! ) . 
  if it makes you feel better , greeks are not `` victim blaming '' . 
  i am in the minority .
