  the ideology that quasi-religiously promotes this `` free '' market is insane . 
  on the other hand , capitalism can be nice and even humane if you regulate it properly . 
  allright , thanks for letting me know , because with his trolling i would have missed your reply . 
  all of this does not counter the point that the muslims in germany were invited . 
  if you suspect some foul play where muslims are secretly brought into europe , please share the facts . 
  i 'm sure many turks would like to know how their parents were `` baited and switched '' in 1961 . 
  lets ignore that it was german industrialists ( who enriched themselves and the german middle class ) the ones that wanted the turks to stay . 
  so instead of posing rhetorical questions , you can just tell us what the objective is , since you clearly have an opinion on it . 
  anyway , on topic !, 
  its funny that islam was not incompatible with europe , when it made great monetary sense to invite muslims over . 
  now that it makes great ** electoral ** sense to deport them , politicians have done a 180 and decided that islam is incompatible with europe . 
  who knows , in some decades from now , when we need something from the muslim world again we 'll change our minds and decide that they are , after all , compatible . 
  i am merely pointing out how disgusting it is to play political games with people who have lives and family here , who did not break the law , who were invited , who played by the book . 
  they are not part of your whole 9/11 retarded fiasco of terrorism . 
  be a little more cynical and see past what the politicians are selling you . 
  the true test of a critical mind is seeing past them when they are catering to you specifically . 
  please leave me alone . 
  i apologize if i hurt your feelings but i did n't harass you at all . 
  i stopped once i saw you were not willing to calmly and rationally discuss with me . 
  i have not replied to you since nor will again . 
  i do n't like reporting people 's post but if you do n't stop following me around i will report you . 
  that 's great but i did n't tell you what the us or eu is . 
  such definitions are made up depending on the view one wants to push . 
  for example if you do n't like obama 's policies , then the us is becoming `` socialist '' , oh no . 
  if you want to prove how awesome capitalism is , then the us is `` capitalist '' . 
  it depends on the context . 
  the value would then be `` not being completely insane '' because freemarketism is a particularly crazy type of radical ideology . 
  ready any ayn rand book would convince you - assuming you can finish that pile of excrement . 
   europe is part of western civilization , which was build , partially at least , on christianity . 
  strange because the more christianity took the backseat , the more the enlightenment came to be and modern europe was slowly shaped . 
  this is a surprisingly profound answer , have an upvote . 
  well according to / r/europe , they are : do n't be muslim . 
  do n't do any muslim stuff . 
  that 's pretty much it . 
  are you against gay marriage and abortion because you are an insane right-winger ? 
  * tradition !, 
  culture !, 
  our forefathers !, 
  our history !, 
  our land !, 
  * do you hold the same views and you are a muslim ? 
  we are going to deport you even if you are a 2nd generation citizen ( not even kidding , people have asked for that repeatedly ) . 
  you do n't understand . 
  you are allowed to behave this way if its for the `` good of the nation '' or out of `` patriotic concern '' for your proud tradition . 
  all your anger becomes justified and you stop being a raging bully , you are now a misunderstood `` concerned citizen '' whom politicians have betrayed to nefarious progressive forces . 
  i can keep going but basically every / r/europe topic nowadays . 
   i am trying only interpret what i can read in the article and see in the video . 
  not really , because you do n't like what the artcile or video has to say . 
  you admit so :  it is manipulative information according my meaning . 
  so what is it ? 
  look , i am not saying you are wrong . 
  you may very well be correct . 
  but it would be a guess , because there is no info in the article . 
  clearly you are guessing based on your personal agenda that is vested in some major conspiracy that has run amok inside the german media . 
  just because the media is not hysterically ranting about the dangers of accepting refugees , does not mean they are manipulating anything . 
  big part of the problem are misguided `` privacy '' laws . 
  big data exists and will continue to exist . 
  they already have collected , and will keep collecting , significant amount of information about us . 
  being ridiculously obsessed about `` privacy '' means that only a select few rich & connected people have access to said data and know how to use it . 
  so they get to benefit and maybe manipulate people based on this information . 
  if more people had access to this information that already exists , that would be a different story . 
  maybe we would n't have such a huge `` information asymmetry '' as we do now . 
  i know i 'll get profoundly downvoted for arguing against data privacy but i just wanted to share a different pov . 
  look at the voting dynamic changing . 
  the moment it was admitted this was sarcastic i got upvoted again and he got downvoted . 
  the anti-muslim brigading is so obvious it hurts . 
  except germany does n't need that birthrate . 
  the whole anti-refugee argument is that europe does not need more people . 
  a fetus is not human . 
  anyone who wants to ban abortion should think if his mother/sister/gf got raped and had to carry that child to birth , how nice would it be to have her choice taken away . 
  also restricting divorce is pretty aggressive , especially since there is no reason for it . 
  they just go ahead and attack their own population for no good reason ( ie dumb ideological reasons , `` marriage is holy ! '', 
  and all that ), 
   did n't say that , i said you seem to refuse to accept cultural history or rather idealized cultural history that is not what idealized means . 
  the `` ideal '' version of something is vastly different than a cheap , misrepresented one made for mass public consumption  yeah i know ... but it still looks german , denying it looks german is dumb . 
  they are denying it is german . 
  its not hard to get really . 
  that was a fast reply . 
  i can defend my answer if you wish , so as to avoid more drama yes , its a very aggressive move to ban abortion , or make divorce difficult esp . 
  if you are thinking of having one . 
  not to mention being a single mother and on a budget ; now you will face homelessness and bankrupcy its quite aggressive and targets a lot of people for no good reason  not getting bennies on everyone elses pocket its funny that you dont have a problem with nuclear families getting bennies on our pocket . 
  nope , you are fine with that  its onle the single mothers or gays that you object to getting free moneys . 
   everybody is aware it is a parody , people find the fact that the nuclear family is now satirised concerning . 
  they are ? 
  its not the family that is satirized , but afd 's backwards obsession with making everyone conforming to that backward 's stereotype . 
  not sure how you would have missed that anyway this is rightfully a cause for concern . 
  its common sense really, 
   these people are probably frustrated by large medial manipuation in germany that mocks them and marginalizes their fears and concerns . 
  its good that they elected you as their representative to tell us why they were mad . 
  let me guess , it was political correctness gone mad ? 
  all those pc liberals jumping down their throat ? 
  and those people were so tired at being called `` racists '' that they decided to boo heiko mass ? 
  its still protest voting imho . 
  and i thought that was the general consensus when it came to afd 's recent popularity . 
  you did n't understand , but people were not afraid of the poster with blonde people . 
  that was a ** parody ** done by a right-wing magazine . 
  what people are afraid of is the afd and its ridiculous ideas like banning abortions . 
  that is what i referred to . 
  abortions are an example . 
  if you are a single mother struggling to get by , knowing that afd wants to target you by slashing your social safety net should make you afraid .
