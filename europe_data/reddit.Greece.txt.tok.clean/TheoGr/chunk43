  though i have to correct myself : ted cruz would be worse than trump . 
  the chaos that trumptards will unleash has the potential to change some things . 
  but cruz would be an unmitigated nightmare . 
  so if trump gets elected , at least i can say it was n't cruz . 
   the investigation into the clinton foundation is still ongoing the announcement was only for her emails . 
  i read that too . 
  it 's strange because the trumptards were swearing that ther emails would be enough to jail her for life . 
  now that that shit blew up , they move the goalposts . 
  it does n't sound very confident . 
  especially not if you read their direct threats of violence . 
  they had a mini-meltdown two days ago and it was creepy to watch . 
   for a greek you should n't want hilary to win . 
  she 's a junta era kinda american politician . 
  she thinks kissanger is great example to follow and praised him . 
  who is kissanger ? 
  and i do n't care who would win , anyone but trump will do , even if its gary johnson . 
   there are mountains of evidence that she is criminally corrup yeah did you miss comey 's latest announcement ? 
  the fbi does not recommend criminal charges for clinton . 
  i am sure you did n't miss it because the trumptards were busy hyping up the fbi as some kind of patriotic force that would jail clinton . 
  but when they made than announcement two days ago , the_dumpster has been in suicide watch mode . 
  there are too many riggers in these elections . 
  we need to stop these riggers from voting . 
  the good thing is that this sub has been quieter these past few days . 
  usually , anyone disagreeing with brexit would be downvoted . 
  but now some anti-brexit comments seem to survive and rise to the top . 
  i can only attribute this to the alt-right brigade being too busy with the elections for them to raid this sub . 
   i do n't claim to know much about hungarian politics , but to me this entire exercise seems more about pr than substance . 
  most of the refugee crisis has been about pr rather than substance . 
  it has been an opportunity for conservative politicians to garnish votes by injecting fear and hysteria into society ala clash of civilizations . 
  very little of the discussion has to do with actual problems and actual solutions . 
  but then again such is politics . 
   i am not `` a concerned citizen '' as it is generally understood , so i ca n't speak for those . 
  no surprise there . 
  it seems nobody is on of them . 
  all these millions of `` concerned citizens '' yet they are nowhere to be found . 
   i do n't like that eu officials believe that they can make those refugees go where they assign them , voluntarily or involuntarily . 
  it 's impossible , especially if you care about human rights at all . 
  this assumes two things : first , countries want to keep them and do n't directly or indirectly push them to germany . 
  second , politicians want the refugee quota system to work . 
  right now nobody gives a shit , as long as border countries ( like mine ) are stuck with half a million of refugees , richer countries ( like the uk ) will continue throwing hissy fits so as to block any quota system that could relieve our pressure . 
  read the article :  a top european union official says refugees can not pick and choose where to be lodged in europe and that they have a responsibility to go where space is available . 
  they are saying word for word what the `` concerned citizens '' have been saying . 
  literally the same thing . 
  yet you still do n't like it . 
  i wonder , if we trashed the notion of human rights , would that make you happy ? 
  or would you still somehow find a way to blame `` them '' again ? 
   a top european union official says refugees can not pick and choose where to be lodged in europe and that they have a responsibility to go where space is available . 
  so even when eu officials agree with you , you still manage to complain ? 
  no the people were not imported because they grew up in germany and are german citizens etc you said the `` conflict '' was imported and that is also not true . 
  as if the germans who invited the turks over in 1970 knew what would happen in 2016 with erdogan, 
   bi is not amazing ** in that regard . 
  if trump loses by a small margin , i predict its gon na get crazy . 
  you 'll have people rioting, 
  opinions do n't necessarily have to be positive or negative . 
  for example : it 's your opinion that identity politics play a large part in the usa today . 
  that is your opinion . 
  but i am sure you know all this and are just trolling now so i 'll leave you to it, 
   basically people flooded the hotel 's facebook with 1 star reviews for daring to host this `` far-right '' event . 
  i really do n't understand this new interpretation of `` far-right '' . 
  nigel farage and sweden democrats are not right-extremists , they 're just not on the left ... maybe you should read the articles you post beforehand ? 
  they did not refer to farage as `` far-right '' but as a populist which is generally true . 
  but even if it was n't true , you 'd still be wrong because you are misquoting your own article, 
   i did n't express an opinion on ** identity politics ** . 
  i think you are confusing me with somebody else . 
  here is what you wrote two posts ago :  the only point i 'm making is that it 's clear that ** identity politics ** play a large part in the usa today dude i think you need to focus more on your psots rather than the feelings of other people, 
  government already decides about welfare , like who get it and how much . 
  so bi is not amazing in that regard . 
  so let me get this straight . 
  you find it `` crazy '' that a woman wants to make something out of herself ( like wanting to have a job before having kids ) but you think that wanting `` double digit '' kids is normal ? 
  i 'm not saying you are the crazy one , you re not , but neither is your german friend . 
  people are different and that is ok . 
   you had to let everyone know how opposed to brexit you were . 
  just as you had to let everyone know how opposed to are to identity politics , because that 's how presidents are elected and not because of their skills right ? 
  i just repaid the favor to see how you 'd react - you did n't disappoint . 
  sorry not op , i meant the first comment in this chain, 
  sorry but you 're gon na have to deal with it , especially if you do n't mind op talking for you but strangely take offense only when i do it, 
   for all you know i may be an obama supporter . 
  nope . 
  ca n't hide behind new accounts my friend . 
   identity politics plays a large part it plays a large part everywhere . 
  large part of brexit was because people had identity issues , like they were obsessed with their english identity above everything else and the tabloids took advantage of that by proclaiming `` the eu hates us ! '', 
  yes . 
  all the people you disagree with are just winning based on color or gender . 
  nothing to do with their skills your skills only matter if you are a buffoonish white male like trump . 
  what does apologizing have to do with freedom of assembly ? 
   but i guess being black is all you need . 
  yes , he got where he is only because of his skin color . 
  people like him because he is black and give credit to him only because he is black . 
  it has nothing to do with his credentials or accomplishments . 
  / s and then you guys go around wondering why people call you racist lol, 
  we feel fucked over by everyone . 
  it is like our worldview, 
  you find people on a beach , there is nowhere to return them . 
  you ca n't just force them back to turkey because they usually do n't want them either at best you have to keep them during deportation process , which takes a lot of time, 
   leave them where they are . 
  in greek islands . 
  thanks a lot . 
  this brings us back to our original point , about poland not giving a fuck about the other eu countries, 
  yeah a picture has actually nothing to do with the `` large overlap '' you imagined and i speak for the things i see . 
  you think the charlie hebdo massacre was an opportunity to be edgy , go ahead man #jesuiswifi you are really destroying these leftist scum,
