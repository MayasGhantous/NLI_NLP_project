  honest question . 
  what would you think would happen to your kid if he or she visited a mosque ? 
  not trying to start anything but i am honestly curious as to why you are terrified of entering a temple . 
  do you know how many temples i 've been in ? 
  some of them are [ beautiful and of immense cultural importance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hagia_sophia ) . 
  guys it is really not difficult to understand that they are * not * forcing religion on anyone . 
  entering a temple is not forced conversion . 
  i mean i am as militant an atheist as they come , but i 've been to temples many times . 
  believe me , they do n't have any magical energy that converts you the moment you step in . 
  i would know . 
  yup . 
  various greek `` concerned citizens '' call it the dorian salute because : * they do n't want to admit it is roman and thus not greek . 
  it would hurt their national pride to admit it was your idea . 
  * they like to pretend it has nothing to do with fascim or nazism . 
  so they just made-up a greek name for it and claim it has nothing to do with totalitarian politics . 
  it is funny yet sad at the same time . 
  communists ? 
  here ? 
  where ?? 
   an obvious religious liberty issue here . 
  what do you think the german government forced them to pray ? 
  like they forced them to become muslims ? 
  do you even understand the purpose of the visit ? 
  god damn the alt-right is cancer, 
   as a teacher if you are a teacher , you should know that the need for education is more important that the parent 's retarded ideological oppositions ( they were members of pegida and afd , i mean seriously ) . 
  kids are not property of their parents . 
  parents ca n't just decide to exclude their kids from school because of their dumb political beliefs . 
  you should really know this or just choose another profession . 
  evidence of the parents being dumb :  the parents do not belong to any religious group and worried that their son could possibly be `` indoctrinated '' during the trip . 
  yes , their son would enter the mosque and automatically turn into a jihadi terrorist . 
  congratulations for defending these parents . 
  [ many greeks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/security_battalions ), 
  hello my immigrant friend , i hope you have calmed down by now . 
  first time i hear someone claim that the dekemvriana were an attempted communist takeover !, 
  in reality , you should thank the communists for holding back and not having elas take over the country , a country that they effectively controlled by 1944 . 
  if they had , your grandfather would have had a very different [ tour of duty ] ( https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcrq3goqtvifi5apmbv0fvya-yaymo2sfhwvvosduucswbdrzoizng )  but they held back and [ even laid down their arms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_varkiza ) , which allowed the cowardly right to persecute them for years . 
  they could n't resist attacking an unarmed enemy . 
  it 's like their favorite thing . 
  anyway , you are right that it 's a good thing we did n't turn communist . 
  can you imagine what might have happened to our magnificent economy ? 
  i mean we might have even gone bankrupt !, 
  that might have force some bright young greeks like you to immigrate . 
  the `` bellamy salute '' lol . 
  this is why i like talking about politics , you never know what flavor of bs you are gon na get . 
  every day is a surprise . 
  here is the truth : this is called the `` dorian salute '' ( \u03b4\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u03c7\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 ) . 
  allegedly !, 
  according to many [ tolerant and educated `` concerned citizens '' in greece ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2014/06/25/photos-show-golden-dawn-leaders-nazi-salutes ) , this salute has ancient hellenic origins and the people [ who perform it ] ( https://xaameriki.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/wpid-metaxas__article.jpg ) are doing it out of love and admiration for the ancient culture of their forefathers . 
  it has absolutely nothing to do with fascism or any other ideology . 
  nothing at all . 
  these people simply love ancient history , that is all . 
  it is just a coincidence that it looks exactly the same with the ways fascists , nazis or other totalitarians saluted their leaders . 
  nothing to see here , move along ... 
  american ? 
  you do n't know about the [ 4th of august regime ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4th_of_august_regime ) , do you ? 
  they were pretty much a carbon copy of fascism , but with a greek flavor . 
  sure , they were n't `` officially '' fascists but [ they were just that ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:metaxas-regime-greek-fascism.png ) in literally anything but their name . 
   `` fucknuts '' wtf does that mean ? 
  edit : all these replies and none of you fucknuts could give me a straight answer ?!, 
  i do n't think it 's that embarrassing . 
  we always knew you guys were a little crazy , and we still like you . 
  what will be embarrassing though , is if trump actually becomes president . 
  thankfully there are still some leftists with common sense . 
  if they were the typical leftist ideologues , they would have opposed clinton too . 
  but they realize that trump is pretty much worse than any candidate in recent memory , so they do the right thing ( no pun intended ) . 
  what will be more funny is watching his fanatical supporters who called the election rigged , suddenly facing the fact that he won . 
  what happens then ? 
  how did he win if clinton rigged the elections ? 
  let me make a prediction , somehow they will blame the immigrants in order to distract the people from that ( and pretty much all ) issues . 
   but , again , if we 're being honest here ( and it is uncomfortable and not pc ) the violence of islam is a much bigger problem at the moment . 
  for whom ? 
  for you ? 
  pretty sure islam is a non-problem in america . 
  but you have a serious problem with your christians loonies . 
  in greece , islam is also not a problem . 
  i ca n't say the same for the cancer that is the orthodox church . 
  in france , things are obviously different . 
  we all agree that jihadi violence is pretty serious . 
  but they are a secular society who is fighting them , i mean they literally bomb the shit out of them whenever they can . 
  so what do you want them to do ? 
  start shooting muslims in the street ? 
  anyway , what you are saying is indeed non-pc , because its also non-true . 
  do n't try to construct grand narrative about a clash of civilization because it does not correspond to reality . 
  not to defend him but , unsurprisingly , most brits do n't speak german . 
  especially that kind of brit . 
  as a greek , this always seemed funny to me . 
  essentially we are celebrating the beginning of the greco-italian war which we ultimately lost ... even thought the italians cheated by summoning hitler to rescue their asses . 
  but , in a more serious note , there might be a reason why we do n't celebrate the end of ww2 . 
  the end of ww2 was not a pleasant experience for us . 
  right after the germans retreated from greece , we started a civil war that bitterly divided our society for decades . 
  maybe you 've come across some quotes from churchill praising the bravery of greek people . 
  like the famous ( and historically dubious ) quote that says `` we will not say hereafter that the greeks fight like heroes , but heroes fight like greeks ! '' . 
  well shortly after he ( allegedly ) said that , his troops started [ gunning down greek civilians in athens ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dekemvriana ) . 
  so thanks for that mr. churchill - the irony is not lost on us . 
  so anyway , this civil war shit could be a reason why we do n't like the ending of ww2 . 
  as someone from a country that was in a similar situation , i can only be jealous ( and a little pissed ) . 
  moving the goalpost already ? 
  oh no you do n't . 
  please explain how `` hate speech '' laws were used to arrest journalists who reported on this . 
  i 'll be waiting .
