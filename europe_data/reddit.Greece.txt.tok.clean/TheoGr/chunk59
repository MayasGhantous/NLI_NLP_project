  and i am happy to see that you are doing your best to hide this dark reality from everyone else . 
  germany 's law , on the other hand , is very different both in scope and intent :  ( 1 ) whoever publicly or by dissemination of writings ( \u00a7 11 par . 
  3 ) defames , in a manner suitable to disturb the public peace , the substance of the religious or world view conviction of others , shall be fined or imprisoned for up to three years major differences are that it protects ** worldviews ** and ** convictions ** , also that it is concerned with ** public peace ** and defamation , concepts that can be applied to secularism and a secular society . 
  the greek law is concerned with magical beings being offended - public peace is totally irrelevant . 
  finally , why are you guys obsessed with whataboutism ? 
  even if the germans had the same law ( which they do n't , as i explained above ) would that be a serious argument ? 
  * but but but the germans are doing it too !? 
  * you realize that if the germans do something stupid , we do not obliged to follow suit ? 
   especially since , yes , we 're getting rid of this law . 
  because everyone agrees it 's dumb . 
  we are not . 
  a disturbing amount of people support such laws . 
  and most of them , as evidenced by the internet , start their arguments by `` as an atheist ... '' . 
   err yes , ` ethnicities ' are subjective and constructed . 
  hence `` what people consider them to be '' is important in this case . 
  they are greek citizens and the greek state mistreated them but they are n't ethnic greeks by their own identification even . 
  that 's great but it does not contradict what i said . 
   it is n't whataboutism in the case of a treaty that is supposed to guarantee the rights of two respective communities . 
  turkey took marginalization to its extreme conclusion in various ways and it seemingly worked even better for the sake of any potential referendum . 
  more whataboutism . 
  whether turkey fucked over its greek minority does not give you the right to start fucking over random muslims dude in komotini . 
  why ? 
  because they had nothing to do with it . 
   erdogan 's `` ammunition '' , marginalization etc. 
  are all unimportant ( not ethically of course ) as long as western thrace remains predominantly greek . 
  if it ever became majority muslim , lack of marginalization or not , we 'd have reason to worry . 
  yes , disenfrachising parts of your country , esp . 
  when they are being courted by a foreign power is the way to go . 
  nothing wrong could ever happen . 
  i can only imagine the right using these people as a self-fulfilling prophecy : first , marginalize them . 
  second , wait until one of them does something stupid . 
  three , use it as an excuse for further nationalism i.e. 
  * see ? 
  we told you these people were all traitors !, 
  allright , no offence meant . 
  its just something fundamental and is the bedrock upon the modern greek identity has been constructed upon . 
  very few people aspire for a modern , secular society anyway . 
   the constitution merely recognises the religious denomination of the majority of the country 's citizens as it has been since the creation of the modern greek state . 
  i do n't think the constitution is descriptive . 
  it is not a document that reflects on the popular sentiment of the current year . 
  you think they run polls every years and update it based on what people believe ? 
  the constitution is prescriptive i.e. 
  it is meant to cement and enforce christianity as the prevailing religion . 
  otherwise there is little sense in adding that article . 
   it may seem like it does , but greece does n't have a state relgion . 
  let us examine that article . 
  what makes a country secular ? 
  according to the wiki :  1 . 
  refuses to commit itself as a whole to any one view of the nature of the universe and the role of man in it . 
  is not homogeneous , but is pluralistic . 
  is very tolerant . 
  it widens the sphere of private decision-making . 
  while every society must have some common aims , which implies there must be agreed on methods of problem-solving , and a common framework of law ; in a secular society these are as limited as possible . 
  problem solving is approached rationally , through examination of the facts . 
  while the secular society does not set any overall aim , it helps its members realize their aims . 
  is a society without any official images . 
  nor is there a common ideal type of behavior with universal application . 
  we score 0 out of 6 . 
  literally 0 . 
   they are n't ethnically greek , just greek citizens so what you mentioned is half-right . 
  i mentioned what people * consider * them to be , which was correct . 
  what the greek ethnicity is , is another issue altogether . 
   marginalization is a different issue , of course ( all citizens are supposed to be protected , not abused , by the state irrespective of ethnicity ) but i suppose the lausanne-respecting turkey no longer has the problem of ` referendums ' now that imbros and tenedos have no greek inhabitants . 
  whataboutism . 
  and marginalization is exactly the issue . 
  erdogan will talk shit , he always does , that does n't mean you have to keep giving him ammunition . 
   these were prosecutions for the breaking of laws passed by parliament , not witch trials . 
  they were laws concerning religion , enforced by the government , and rabidly supported by the church which protested with all its might . 
  so it fits the description perfectly whether you like it or not . 
   it is a great privilege that our country is set in a way that we have some oversight over them . 
  yeah i do n't think it is a great privilege to be arrested because i offended jesus on the internet . 
  but you `` as an atheist '' seem to praise this situation ? 
  it seems your argument is a weird whataboutism about russia and bulgaria . 
  i do n't really know what to say , besides that i am happy that some people stand up against the church , like the pasok government who successfully stood up to the bully known as christodoloulos . 
  if everybody thought like you , nobody would have stood up . 
   we 'll be dammed if kids do n't study the new testament in school . 
  we do not study the new testament in school . 
  we certainly do n't study for cultural , literature or historical purposes either . 
  take a look at the curriculum if you do n't believe me ( [ gymnasium ] ( http://www.iep.edu.gr/index.php/el/40-thriskeftika1/521-thriskeftika-didaktiko-yliko-dimotiko-2 ) , [ lyceum ] ( http://www.iep.edu.gr/index.php/el/menu-erga/menu-co-financed/40-thriskeftika1/522-thriskeftika-didaktiko-yliko-dimotiko-3 ) ) . 
  what we learn is various dogmatic points regarding mostly christianity , other religions are also examined from a obvious ( and unapologetic ) orthodox viewpoint . 
   the homeric epics were pretty much the bible of pagans no . 
  literally nobody has said this . 
  ever . 
   we better make school a safe place because someone might disagree with them ... tough luck , kid !, 
  you aint learning shit !, 
  this perfectly describes the church 's attitude when it comes to evolution and other `` progressive '' stuff . 
  let 's ban everything that disagrees with the official narrative . 
   i 'm against brexit , but where is the sense in a 2nd referendum ? 
  i dunno , maybe ask farage because [ he was demanding a second referendum in case they lost ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/nigel-farage-wants-second-referendum-7985017 ) . 
  but it seems that referendums are ok only if they support a specific agenda . 
  greece is not a secular country . 
  do n't take my word for it , but our constitution which makes that point very clear . 
  just read [ article 3 ] ( http://www.hri.org/docs/syntagma/artcl25.html#a3 ) . 
  that 's right . 
  no western country would do that . 
  it 's not like a western country would [ forbid its own people from holding another referendum ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-theresa-may-scottish-independence-referendum-rules-out-second-a7139391.html ) when it goes against its nationalistic agenda . 
   there has n't been a single political decision in greece that has been affected by the church in any way since the 1800s . 
  except there have been several . 
  most notable was [ father pastitsios ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elder_pastitsios ) in 2012 . 
  in that case , the police [ raided the blogger 's house and searched his computers ] ( http://booksjournal.gr/slideshow/item/1528-%c2%ab%cf%80%cf%8e%cf%82-%ce%b2%ce%af%cf%89%cf%83%ce%b1-%cf%84%ce%bf%cf%85%cf%82-%ce%bd%cf%8c%ce%bc%ce%bf%cf%85%cf%82-%ce%ba%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%ac-%cf%84%ce%b7%cf%82-%ce%b2%ce%bb%ce%b1%cf%83%cf%86%ce%b7%ce%bc%ce%af%ce%b1%cf%82-%cf%83%cf%84%ce%b7%ce%bd-%ce%b5%ce%bb%ce%bb%ce%ac%ce%b4%ce%b1%c2%bb ) .
