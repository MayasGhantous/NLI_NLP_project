  they then sentenced him to 10 months in jail . 
  there is more . 
  the timeframe you gave , `` since the 1800s '' is dishonest . 
  we had a lot of trials last century . 
  most of them were against darwinism , something that the church bitterly opposes to this day . 
  you can [ read about it here ] ( http://www.iospress.gr/ios2000/ios20000730a.htm ) but the short version is this : the church is very active when it comes to education and was banning any educational material deemed `` heretical '' , up until the 1990s . 
  [ stavrianos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/l._s._stavrianos ) was a world famous historian who had his handbook removed from the curriculum around 1990 [ because its evolutionary teachings went against the church 's bronze age dogma ] ( http://sfrang2.blogspot.de/2009/02/blog-post_24.html ) . 
  there are redditors who went to school back then . 
  if you did n't , ask your parents what the situation was like . 
  i would politely describe some of the parents as `` religious militias '' considering the amount of fanaticism they showed in their support of the church . 
  so yeah , you do n't have to worry about saudi arabia when your own country is invading houses and arresting people because they offended jesus . 
  but this is the internet , where most people do n't speak greek so we can continue to pretend that we are a progressive and secular society !, 
   the only way to guarantee that the state is in total control of religion , is if the church and state are one . 
  as an atheist , i find that idea to be insane . 
  we do n't live in byzantine times anymore . 
   yes , i know it 's counter intuitive but i think secularism leads to more fanaticism and there is it . 
  completely predictable , the jab against secularism finally comes . 
  question : why does every argument that supports the church and attacks secularism is ** always ** prefaced by `` as an atheist ... '' . 
  why do you have to say that ? 
  i do n't understand how one can claim to be an atheist and then completely support the church and also deny any wrongdoings it has done . 
  the majority of greeks disagree with this . 
  they love their church . 
  i would even say that the idea of a `` modern , secular society '' is deeply offensive to greek sensibilities . 
  i am surprised that you belong to this church but do n't know its cultural and political place in the country that spawned it . 
   why is r/europe suddenly against them now . 
  because they are done by the `` wrong '' kind of people i.e. 
  non-white non-christians . 
   but as far as turkey 's expansionist policy is concerned , muslim = turkish . 
  the same applies as far as greece 's policy is concerned . 
  we never considered these people `` greek '' and we have marginalized them for years . 
  nobody should be surprised that turkey takes advantage of the situation . 
   any swedish who do n't agree will be relocated to ... syria ? 
  we 'll have a full circle of perpetual relocations . 
  problems solved, 
   greece has been revealed to rank atop the list of the world 's most sexually active nations , ** averaging 164 sessions ** a year , or more than three times a week , german newspaper bild reports . 
  what they wo n't tell you is that these sessions were not necessarily with another person . 
  if you know what i mean . 
   their cultural norms are drastically different i would say your cultural norms are drastically different with those of many europeans, 
   the only long term solution is the australian solution except we are not australia and there is no place to put these people , nor the political will to do so you say you want to stash everyone in a greek island . 
  this will never happen . 
  you are more likely to get greek people to pay taxes than to accept this plan . 
  i mean you are out of touch with political reality . 
  i suspect you already know this and people like you are deliberately pushing for unrealistic solutions that will only further destabilize the eu, 
  people will complain about anything and everything . 
  i guess based on the odds ? 
  i mean what are the odds that a society will have such a fair and proportional representation of all views from extremely tolerant to wanting to beat the shit out of everyone ? 
   you recognise the bias amongst `` muslim apologists '' maybe it 's time to recognise the bias in your own history classes ? 
  hell , in balkans all of the countries ' history classes contradict each other and are nationalist propaganda thorough and thorough , not so different in turkey of course but then again i do n't remember anything i learned in history classes . 
  i had no idea that devshirme was abolished in the 1600s . 
  as you can probably imagine , our education was obsessed with the blood tax , it 's like this i learned about the ottoman empire : they raped our women and stole our kids . 
  the idea that there were white ( or actually greek ) converts to islam is so politically incorrect you ca n't even think it without someone getting offended . 
  you should be highly skeptical when you encounter balanced representations of all views . 
  reality is never really balanced and usually such depictions are , essentially , political correctness . 
  like trying really hard to be fair to everyone and not offend anyone too . 
  you achieved peak identity politics, 
   i did n't know sex with roadkill was illegal til, 
   no-one can be surprised when financial institutions that want/require an eu base of operations move those operations to an eu member state . 
  besides the 52 % of a certain nationality, 
   and i think you could argue in court that this law could indeed be used to protect an atheist that was mocked for being an atheist . 
  despite what the internet says , atheism is not a religion, 
  yeah pretty much . 
  it is also weird that you are downvoted in a sub that prides itself on being secular and liberal , right wingers included . 
  but i guess blasphemy laws are ok if they are pro-christian ? 
   the left , liberal politicians like merkel right, 
   you 'll need to wait for the bank of england 's website to return to normal as they 're experiencing heavy traffic . 
  was this happening before brexit ? 
  honest question since i was n't paying attention . 
  edit : yeah i guess i 'll just read that doc , though it 's pretty long ... 
  i see what you are saying , but there is also the other side of it : he was appeasing to the conservative middle class anxiety of been perceived as racist . 
  it 's like , * look at me , i have a woman standing here and various non-white dudes . 
  i am a very tolerant person . 
  may you like it or not . 
  it 's not that i do n't like it , i mean i do n't have any feelings on the topic . 
  it is just illogical . 
  building a wall is a direct response to the threat of war . 
  you do n't build heavily armed fortifications if you think your neighbor is peaceful and you will never have to go to war with him . 
  you are not as exceptional as you think you are other member states have agency . 
  if they felt strongly about it they would have spoken out . 
  you are not the only `` sovereign '' nation but the uk media gives the impression that the eu is a totalitarian superstate and all its members are subjugated to brussels ... except the uk of course, 
   and/or because they 're still adhering to the dead ideology of an european superstate . 
  i have some news for you , just because you have a pathological hatred for the eu and the germans does not mean the idea is dead seeing you go from topic to topic and frantically claim that eurofederalism is dead seems like you are trying to put out a fire ( and failing at it ), 
  you think the french fortifying their country was an act of weakness ? 
  also , france lost like 4,3 % of their total population in ww1 , not to mention the destruction visited on their own land and infrastructure . 
  and you call them hippies , from the safety of your keyboard . 
  amazing that you still complain despite getting what you wanted, 
   all this without romanian child protection services and law enforcement being able to do anything for fear of being accused of restricting cultural freedoms and being sued in european court and forced out of their job . 
  has this ever happened ? 
   muslims in the first world need to stop finding the public displaying of muhammad offensive i agree but good luck telling religious people not to be offended you should call for an atheistic approach and not an explicitly anti-muslim one . 
   the quoted law is a law against insulting people for their religion and that makes it better ? 
  what about the underrepresented demographic of irreligious people ? 
  they do n't get any legal protection for their beliefs . 
   or vandalizing temples . 
  maybe i misunderstood that but why do you need a special law for that ? 
  vandalizing a temple should be just as punishabe as vandalizing any private property . 
  your previous generation grew up at a time where it was considered unthinkable that christianity would be offended . 
  it was also illegal . 
   michael newman , a secondary school science teacher and an atheist , was arrested under england 's blasphemy law for selling wingrove 's blasphemous video , visions of ecstasy in february 1992 in birmingham . 
  he was forced to resign from his school position due to protests from christian parents . 
  as a result , he became a subject of discussion in the media , including an appearance on channel four 's comment [ 35 ] programme in england . 
  [ 36 ] you think within one generation these people have become rational secularists and tolerate insults at jesus ?
