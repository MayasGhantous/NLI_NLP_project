  this must be the best comment here . 
  no matters what one feels about flags and unrecognized countries , the shit eurovision gets into is n't really worth anyone 's time . 
  greece sucks so fucking bad , its embarrassing . 
  these unemployment numbers , given how big and durable they are , have probably condemned a whole generation to mire in shit . 
  the greek response is to blame merkel , germany , the eu , the euro , the americans , even capitalism . 
  pretty much everyone else except ourselves . 
  and how can that be true , when literally everyone else is doing better ? 
  edit : except macedonia , yeah they are in the same shit as we are , what a great consolation ... 
  last time this temple bombing was mentioned , people here were raging because nationalists were allegedly blamed for the bombings . 
  yet nobody blamed any nationalists ( i think i saw one comment , that was heavily downvoted too ) . 
  so i am expecting a lot of rage at this perceived injustice . 
  * you dared blame the nationalists when it was filthy muslims who did this ? 
  * one again , nobody blame the right wing ( except the rare downvoted idiot ) but that wo n't prevent them from playing the victim card . 
  also , several posts of people complaining that they are being called `` racists '' and `` nazis '' when nothing like that happens . 
  prepare for the self-victimization party !, 
  interesting story . 
  i 've never heard of it , now i need to look it up , because it sounds very believable . 
  here is a well known but rarely mention fact : this modern greek identity is made up . 
  what we really are is the descendants of the citizens of the eastern roman empire . 
  everything in our culture , religion and language attests to that . 
  our so-called `` hellenic '' roots is bullshit and its totally made up by european romantics . 
  however , explaining the above to greek people provokes extreme anger . 
  well that 's better instead of repeating how non-special i am !, 
  i 'm glad we got past that . 
  you are not calling out the country 's problem . 
  what happened is that you got offended that i insulted greek people , and you felt the instinctive need to put me down . 
  it 's that simple really . 
  so i guess my original post applied 100 % to you , which is why you keep going at this . 
  i clearly hit a nerve . 
  its a good thing , receiving a dose of reality from time to time . 
  its even worse when it comes to my people , due to the complications of the greek nationality ( ancient hellenic , roman era , modern era ) . 
  its just a mess . 
  do n't try to make much sense of it just laugh , 
   this is such a blatant thievery and no one in eu will say a word about it because vucic is their most faithful `` partner '' in serbia . 
  why are you blaming the eu instead of your own country ? 
  i mean is * anything * not the eu 's fault nowadays ? 
   anatolia consisted of various greek cultures but they all identified being greek maybe you mean roman ? 
  except the western shores of anatolia , was there really much greekness to it ? 
  i imagine the people were known mostly for their religious and political ( imperial ) identity , rather having a pure ethnic greek one , whatever the hell `` greek '' meant in 900ad . 
  its funny to see this map , considering how much people rage at the prospect of demographical or national change . 
  note that christianity was n't totally established back then , for some parts of europe it was pretty much an invading religion . 
  there are some monarchists left in greece . 
  greek monarchy was an actual thing up until [ 1974 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_republic_referendum,_1974 ) , when it was abolished . 
  as an institution , it was divisive and opportunistic . 
  there are still some tiny pockets of monarchists left in the countryside . 
  mostly religious fanatics and insane conservatives ( even for greek standards ) , some of them even hold on to old [ proto-fascist ideas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freethinkers%27_party ) . 
  they are not a political force of any importance and within one or two generations they will have disappeared completely . 
  as i see it , the commonwealth 's monarchy is an ancient , indigenous institution that is part of their culture and identity . 
  for greece , its a foreign concept , [ installed by the great powers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/london_conference_of_1832 ) in an attempt to control the bunch of sheep-herding warlords that populated the early greek state . 
  once more , i am not here to exciting or unique or cool so as to entertain you . 
  being your special snowflake is not in my interest . 
  yet you keep repeating `` you 're not special !, 
  you 're not special ! '', 
  as if it matters . 
  that is why i asked you if you are an adult because you sound like someone obsessed with people being unique or different , which is n't usually an adult trait . 
  i do n't know what you tell you . 
  i expect you will respond with your usual `` you are not special !! '', 
  answer , to which i can just keep responding `` i do n't care , i am not here for your entertainment '' . 
  we can keep doing this forever , or you can just assume that will be my default answer from here onwards . 
  or , you can just grow up . 
  i grew up in greece ( unlike you maybe ? 
  do n't know ) and i have every right to feel the anger which stems from decades of the disgusting cultural , political and economical failure of my country . 
  deal with it . 
  accept it . 
  let it sink in , because you will keep hearing it . 
  i am not going to stop or change my attitude for your entertainment . 
  either downvote me , ignore me , or even talk to me as if you are an adult ( you 're not special !!, 
  you 're not different !! ), 
  or just ** move on with your life ** . 
  it 's your call really . 
   we must not be tolerant of the intolerant try saying that and being a liberal , people will bitch and moan about political correctness all day long . 
  what they want you to say is : * we must not be tolerate muslims * . 
  any other kind of intolerance ( e.g. 
  against far right wingers or nationalists ) is bad because of `` democracy '' and how are you not respect `` dissenting '' views ? 
  you forgot to complain about the pc brigade calling you a `` racist '' and thus silencing you . 
  depends . 
  if the perpetrators are muslims and/or immigrants , no . 
  if there were no muslims and/or immigrants involved , there obviously yes - there would be a shitload of people screaming about feminist hysteria promoting fake rape culture , hating men , the usual stuff . 
  but yeah now its muslims so lets taking groping seriously . 
  bunch of hypocrites . 
  likewise , i think you need to take a break from internet warfare where you see people calling you a `` nazi '' all the time . 
  you think you are winning and its sad , because all you do is troll . 
  your links . 
  first link , mentions that freedom party were former nazis who never underwent denazification as a party . 
  its true . 
  i am sorry if reality offends you , but its true . 
  that is what your fp\u00d6 heroes were . 
  second link is feynmann shit-talking about orban 's policies . 
  third link does n't even have the word nazi lol . 
  where are the crowds ? 
  keep moving the goalposts . 
  its pointless to ask for evidence because you 'll just keep goolging the word `` nazi '' and throwing links at me ( which you obviously do n't even read first ) ps : the `` are u mad bro ?!!? '', 
  shtick is silly , even for your standards . 
  [ read this ] ( http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/member-countries/romania/index_en.htm ) . 
  maybe i did n't understand it correctly but does n't it say that you take way more than you put it ? 
   total eu spending in romania -- $ 5.944 billion  total romanian contribution to the eu budget -- $ 1.353 billion also why the fuck are you defending your nation ? 
  did i not make it clear that i am a liberal who does n't adopt these negative stereotypes ? 
  turn the clock back 10 or 20 years , ask any proud conservative all over europe what he thinks of romanians and if he calls you `` thieves '' consider yourself very lucky . 
  do n't flatter yourself . 
  it was the openess of the progressive european civilization that was a tremendous help to elevating your country .
