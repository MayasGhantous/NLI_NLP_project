  i kind of see your perspective now . 
   were me and my siblings made fun of in school ? 
  yeah but guess what ? 
  at least we could go to school . 
  honestly , i agree with everything except this . 
  bullying , if taken too far , can actually destroy your growth as a person . 
  we should n't be obsessed if people like us ( that feels very insecure anyway ) but attacking people like that is generally wrong . 
  i mean i 'm an immigrant myself but if bullying was part of the deal then i 'd rather take my skills and education elsewhere . 
  maybe . 
  help me understand then , where did you immigrate from and why ? 
  if you do n't mind sharing . 
  lol did you just post a denzel washington movie as being relevant to immigration ? 
  not to mention that it depicts an utterly shitty parenting approach . 
  i wish i 'd see more comments like yours when we inadvertently encounter body shaming and misogyny . 
  but for some weird reason , it 's only when muslims are involved when these diatribes pop up . 
  long winded posts with googled excerpts from the quran , instructing us how bad this specific religion is . 
  for some reason , if a woman is abused by a non-muslim , we do n't see these posts . 
  when college girls are raped by native `` alpha males '' all we see is her being called a feminazi , a sjw , a liberal slut who had sex and then changed her mind and now tries to ruin the life of a proud man because feminism corrupted her . 
  for some reason , in order to be taken seriously , a woman has to be harassed or assaulted by a muslim . 
  otherwise she is a feminazi . 
  they will be taught separately . 
  this has been mentioned multiple times . 
  they will be in different classes when the other children have finished their school day . 
  people who use their kids to push their disgusting agenda are the cancer of society . 
  i mean every disgusting and moronic reactionary/regressive policy has been pushed by scumbags saying `` but but but but think of the children !!!, 
   you say i have insulted you then you proceed by using `` someone like you '' . 
  it was n't an insult but an observation . 
  i 've seen how you reply and how people like you reply here . 
  and yes , all your posts are the typical right-wing trolling points . 
   nice deflection though . 
  yeah no does n't work like that my friend . 
  i made a case against angry nationalists ( like yourself ) in greece threatening with ** illegal action ** if they do n't have their way . 
  you had nothing to say to that ( and had already collected all the karma you wanted ) so just ignored every rational argument and made it personal . 
  you had so many opportunities to learn about this situation from a native speaker ( since most articles are in greek ) and i could even translate them for you if you ** really ** wanted to know what happened in these two schools . 
  i would be your man . 
   now back to you , what have you done for the refugees , apart from laying empty words ? 
  i already answered that , very clearly , without embarrassment or fear . 
  it is in my previous response . 
  it is obvious that you just came here to troll and personally attack people . 
  or , you do n't understand basic english . 
  either way , it 's your problem . 
  not that i expected anything better from someone like you . 
  what i want for them to do is exactly what i did : nothing . 
  just sit home , live your life , take your kids to school , as usual . 
  they would n't even see the refugee children because they will be taught in their own classes when the native kids do n't attend school . 
  but what they do is threaten to break the law ( occupy public property ) because they disagree with who gets an education * my * country , and that is how thugs and criminals behave . 
  you ca n't occupy public buildings because you disagree with who studies there . 
  and you , of course you 'd support illegal activities as long as suits your sick nationalistic agenda . 
  speaking of you now , what glorious deeds have you done to further honor the pride and honor your proud homeland ? 
  how have you upheld your homeland 's pride and honor ? 
  by fighting off hordes of ... refugee children ? 
  lol . 
  what a brave man you are . 
  what are you even talking about alt-right histrionics detected, 
  nice . 
  within two posts we went to child abuse . 
  well done / r/europe , it 's only here and in stormfront that refugee children are enthusiastically labelled `` child abusers '' . 
  the vast majority of them are taking refuge in neighboring countries . 
  and you did n't contribute . 
  you made a promise to take in 20,000 but you took in around ~ 5,000 . 
  that is nothing in the scope of your economy . 
  greece has taken in literally 10 times that and what did you do ? 
  left the eu . 
  so let 's not pretend that you paid anything or did anything or even suffered any consequences from this . 
  your objection to muslim refugees is ideological , it has nothing to do with such economic facts . 
   of course it does . 
  they see at as a sign that all those tens of thousands of people who 've just decided to illegally stay there will be kept . 
  illegally ? 
  kept ? 
  where is this based on besides the typical right wing hysteria ? 
   edit : people itt seem to think those greeks are evil and do n't care for human rights . 
  i think the average outraged greek - which i bet are n't that many - have nothing against educating migrant kids , i think they 're decent , like most human beings , and would even help in some capacity with the education effort if things were clearer . 
  nope . 
  they an ideological , cultural and religious objections to educating migrant kids . 
  they make it very clear . 
  i know their `` declaration '' in is in greek , i could translate it , but it wo n't matter , since no matter what the facts are absolutely nothing can change the mind of angry conservatives ** who literally believe they are fighting for their faith , pride , honor and country against ... refugee children . 
  **  i think those greeks are mad because things are n't clear , and they register the push to state-educate those children as a sign that they 're there to stay . 
  it 's not about children getting educated and basic human rights not being respected . 
  it 's the uncertainty and them being fed up . 
  again , none of this has any basis in reality . 
  it is 100 % about children and about basic human rights . 
  read the article . 
  parents want to prevent refugee children from getting educated . 
  it is very straightforward and they literally admit so themselves : the parents of children going to two schools ( on in filippiada , one in oreokastro ) have threatened to `` take over '' their schools if refugee kids are educated there . 
  they are actually threatening to break the law without any fears of the consequences . 
  nice to see what kind of scumbags conservatives support , of course / r/europe too . 
  it is like you go out and look to find the worst possible scumbags , people who are waging a war against refugee children being educated on the basis that they are ( and i quote ) `` altering our national , cultural and religious identity '' . 
  tl/dr ; identity politics mixed with populism , against children no less, 
   it 's their country afterall . 
  who am i to decide what 's good for greeks ? 
  well then its a good thing that the country does not belong to these dudes why do you think their opinion matters , really ? 
  i am also greek , am i allowed to occupy any school because i do n't like some people who study there ( in a class that does not even overlap with mine - the refugees are taught separately in different hours ) ? 
  that is disgusting and uncivilized behavior but sadly very common from these types of `` concerned citizens '', 
  because destroying your own economy does not absolve one of [ legal obligations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convention_relating_to_the_status_of_refugees ) . 
  it is such a dishonest argument anyway . 
  the uk has a great economy and people were still complaining about the `` poor '' brits who are forced to pay for the billions of refugees entering their country . 
  when that rhetoric collapsed , the arguments changed to `` but some things are more important than money ! '' . 
  so all this is basically a pretense for nationalistic hysteria . 
  dude i fully support human rights and their un declaration . 
  i was just stating how utterly indifferent to them these proud christian parents are .
