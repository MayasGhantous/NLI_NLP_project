  do you get it ? 
  that is like me failing to do my job because i was too afraid of the `` racist patriarchy '' and letting innocent kids get hurt . 
  and then spinning that to blame the right-wing for my own fuckups . 
  and even if i accept the last case at face value , you got one ( 1 ) example of suppression against literally hundreds of stories of immigrant/refugee violence that were not suppressed . 
  it is the typical tactic of ideologues to focus only on the small % of the cases that fit their narrative while deliberately ignoring everything else . 
  it would be like me posting stories of `` concerned citizens '' who go [ and firebomb refugee families ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/27/world/europe/germany-migrant-arson-trial.html ) and then start calling everyone who disagrees with me a `` racist '' . 
  i do n't think you know what political suppression is . 
  i could give you some personal examples of what [ actual political suppression ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_military_junta_of_1967%e2%80%9374 ) is , but you 'd brush that off too , by saying `` but but but communists did that too ... '' . 
  all in all , you are another crazy ideologue who wants to present himself as nuanced . 
  ** edit2 ** : damn man you are a total waste of time . 
  the alleged suppressor you mentioned , henriette reker , was actually [ stabbed in the neck by a right-wing extremist ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/19/stabbed-mayor-cologne-elected-pro-refugee ) . 
  so here we have a case of political violence where elected representatives are being physically attacked ( presumably with a * long knife * ) because they dare to have wrong ( a.k.a. 
  `` unpatriotic '' or `` globalist '' ) opinions . 
  yet you deliberately ignore this example of real suppression and focus on a comment she made , taken out of context , of course . 
  orwell would be proud !, 
  as if you are a tourist ? 
  that is even weirder . 
  i ca n't imagine viewing the world in such a manner . 
  say i am a tourist in germany , why on earth would i feel entitled to them behaving in a specific ( stereotypical ) way ? 
  it is just bizzare . 
   the right is looking most sensible on this issue of course not . 
  the populists that have risen are anything but sensible or nuanced . 
  they are insane and obsessed with vague ideological issues or feelings/identity politics . 
  only in / r/europe can one find parties like afd being described as sensible  as for your assertions that discussion around the negative impacts of immigration is not suppressed , you 're wrong on this one . 
  there 's suppression and a whole lot of subterfuge going on . 
  the swedish police , british mps , german police commissioners have all been revealed to have downplayed or attempted to censor stories that take the shine off immigration . 
  you keep asserting that but the evidence is not there . 
  just because the media is not foaming at the mouth 24/7 against the raping refugees does not mean there is suppression . 
  you guys attempt to inject the refugees in literally every discussion , i mean just browse through / r/europe and there is literally no issue free from anto-refugee shitposting . 
  the media does not have to be like this too . 
  yes , the globalists ordered me so, 
  but they are asserting their proud national identity , they are anti-political correctness , questioning immigration , proudly standing up to the globalists etc / s what i found funny was a polish poster here who cheered on brexit , regardless of its implications on the lives of his own people . 
  please stop, 
   it 's just tragedy of the commons many people say this and i sort-of agree , but i think it misses out on some cultural aspects . 
  we do n't respect health . 
  like our actual , real , physical well-being . 
  greek culture is overwhelmingly concerned with ideological or metaphysical struggles . 
  our physical health is very low on our priority list . 
  the `` tragedy of the commons '' is a human thing , not a greek thing . 
  other cultures have managed to shame or shun smoking . 
  we have n't . 
  if we greeks ever decide that physical health matters ( if only half as much as our `` spiritual health '' or our `` national pride '' ) we could change our smoking behavior immediately . 
   does that fact that you have n't met a person like this prove they do n't exist ? 
  and just because you 've met a bunch of people like this , it does n't prove that `` the left '' believes in this weird ideological strawman you created . 
   media links that 's like me combing the media and finding out instances where right-wingers are `` racist '' and then spamming about it . 
  note that i do n't doubt the stories you posted . 
  i accept them as 100 % factual . 
  the issue is context like how many were these `` hard-leftists '' ? 
  if i find [ thousands of greek neo-nazi supporters ] ( http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/greece-golden-dawn-ilias-kassidiaris-430907 ) does it mean i get to call everyone a `` racist '' ? 
  no it does n't . 
   suppress discussions around the negative impacts of immigration again , this does not happen , it 's only people complaining about `` suppressed discussions '' and not people actually `` suppressing '' the `` discussions '' themselves . 
  i think it 's called : disagreeing . 
  just because people disagree that all refugees are mass-raping jihadis does not mean you are being `` suppressed '' . 
  you really do n't, 
   `` do n't you dare step out of line or we will gang up on you to punish you economically . '', 
  apparently , not giving in to the uk 's ridiculous demands ( that they knew were ridiculous before their referendum , i mean everybody told them you ca n't have a common market without freedom of movement ) is now considered `` punishment '' or `` ugly '' or even `` criminal '' . 
  as it is `` criminal '' for the other european politicians to look after their own country 's economic interests . 
  because when the uk does it , it 's not `` criminal '' . 
  it 's only `` criminal '' when ze germans do it . 
  i admit though , this right-wing circlejerk is quite funny and will only intensify in the coming months . 
   or are you a globalist that believes that nations do n't exist and states should exist to serve themselves . 
  i 've literally never seen a person argue this position . 
   i want to meet english people with english traditions why do you think you are entitled to this ? 
  are n't the people who live in that country entitled to shape their own culture any way they see fit , and not necessarily conform to any stereotypes ? 
   those on the left are less nuanced . 
  ` immigration is good ' is a belief held in the abstract i keep hearing this but never from a left-winger . 
  is n't that a little strange ? 
  same with the `` the left supports islam '' narrative . 
  always hearing about it but i 've yet to encounter a person that actually supports it , only people who claim others support it . 
  this is the best rationalization of lying i 've read . 
  well done sir . 
  everytime a politician makes false promises to his people , we can just brush it off with `` i was n't promising anything , i was just fighting the battle of rhetoric '' , whatever that battle is . 
  first time i 've head that term . 
  anyway awesome justification for political propaganda man . 
  goebbels would be proud . 
   nothing in the world beats the greek lifestyle . 
  let me tell you , unemployment beats it, 
  sure , right after you share that national poll where these people are being called racist . 
  of course he wo n't , because you agree with breitbart and absolutely love the narrative they sell, 
  country ! = skin color, 
  no greek has ever felt this way or done anything like this , nor was there any reason to, 
  whining when being downvoted , whining when being upvoted . 
   then there 's a poor guy bringing up immigration and refugees only to be promptly silenced by the german guys arguing that the vote and immigration are completely unrelated subjects and he should just stop talking about it . 
  good . 
  the trolling needs to stop . 
  not every thread needs to be about the refugees . 
  we do n't need the trumptard brigade shouting about rapist muslims on each and every thread . 
  there are enough rapist muslim threads already , you do n't need to convert each and every one into a shouting match about the liberal new world order and the `` leftist '' merkel importing rapist muslims to deliberately destroy your proud national culture . 
  take a break man . 
   whose extent of analysis is to just label their own poor as racist and stupid . 
  it is fitting , considering the extend of these `` poor '' people 's analysis is to label every foreigner as a job-stealer and a rapist, 
   meanwhile the guy is unemployed and ashamed to look at his wife , and his kids hates him . 
  take it easy with the drama there, 
   i honestly think that the liberals in charge of europe liberals , like merkel / s, 
  i like to think that we colonized each other ... makes it hurt less, 
  you keep telling others to chill , yet maybe you should take your own advice once in a while . 
  you are like brexit 's resident apologist here . 
  you post the same stuff on every such discussion and then spend a couple of hours whining because not everyone agrees with your anti-eu agenda ( in a european sub , surprise surprise ) . 
  do you intend to keep posting this in every thread ? 
  playing the victim quickly gets tiring .
