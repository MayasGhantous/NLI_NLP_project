  you are right , meanwhile it is not harmful at all to paint the same picture when muslims are involved, 
  downvoted for mentioning what the story is * actually * about , and daring not to join the anti-muslim circlejerk ah , / r/europe, 
   p.s. 
  i 'm aware i 'll receive hundreds of doenvotes due to my impopoular view . 
  you are not edgy . 
  you are in / r/europe . 
  your view is quite typical here . 
  so sit back and collect the karma . 
  make a bid like everyone else, 
  yeah but i do n't think the japanese government just went ahead on its own and randomly made that statement . 
  there probably was some lobbying by these companies that led to this . 
  i agree with your idea to use incentives/disincentives . 
  but as a greek person i can tell you that this system can be horribly abused . 
  i imagine companies hiring truck drivers who do n't exist , only on paper , to collect that sweet fine money . 
  it would be impossible to check which of the 1000s of truck drivers are real and which are not . 
  such a task would require hiring inspectors which would cost a shitload of money themselves , not to mention the bureaucracy . 
  nevermind , it was a shitty comment , i tried too hard this may be one of the few times i deserved the downvotes, 
  yes, 
  i do n't know , you are the ones bitching about them despite not taking them in . 
  sounds crazy if you ask me . 
  in fact i wish if stopped caring about them , and spare us the drama . 
  but maybe your question was rhetorical ? 
  then sadly it only highlights how bad your brit banter is . 
  mate . 
   yeh , and the europeans have all been begging city firms to move to their countries post-brexit . 
  you are using a present tense to refer to something in the future ( post-brexit ) how about you figure out what is wrong with that , before preaching about morality, 
  because middle eastern `` geo politics '' as you call them create a shitload of refugees that the eu is forced to handle . 
  and ofc then you proceed to endlessly bitch and moan about these refugees , despite not taking in any ( ~ 5000 ) . 
   instead of actually channeling that anger against the people who created those immigration policies there is a lot of political propaganda specifically designed to create feelings of hopelessness and disenfranchisement when it comes to that . 
  these people are told , for decades , that the `` government '' or the `` system '' hates them and does not listen to them . 
  so they keep getting angrier and angrier , with a mentality like * but i voted for < insert right wing party  , why do i keep seeing these immigrants in my country ?!?!, 
  * combine that with the anti-pc climate that encourages people to not give a fuck , to simply give in to any urge they have . 
  so anyway , given enough agitation - and enough beers - these people are bound to lash out violently . 
  and why not ? 
  they can justify it by saying * well it 's just a fight , big deal , we have fights all the time mate !, 
  * of course there is no actual disenfranchisement going on . 
  in a democracy , your side of the argument wo n't always win . 
  you ca n't always get what you want . 
  sometimes you lose . 
  i mean i understand that it sucks for them because i feel the same way about greek politics ( no big party represents me ) but that does n't mean we are ignored by a malicious `` system '' that is there only to oppress our proud national feelings . 
  oh yes . 
  `` polish '' is not a race so it ca n't be racist / s, 
   they 're just doing the best they can for their self-interest their self-interest lies in a strong and united europe . 
  nobody gains anything if greece is a bankrupt shithole . 
  of course many people appreciate it , but that is because of its religious connotations . 
  this is n't the case with classical art . 
  but the point was about stagnation of art ( among other thing ) . 
  and you mention an art form that is designed to be dogmatically unchanging . 
  the ottomans did not make our orthodox iconography stagnate , it is literally the exact same art today as it was a thousand years ago . 
  go to any greek church and see for yourself . 
  do n't be so dramatic . 
  this is a 40 year contract . 
  hopefully the next generation ( s ) of greeks wo n't be so corrupt , so when the contract runs out , our people will use these airports to earn money for our country instead of driving us further into debt ( and then blaming the germans ) . 
  not sure if sarcasm ... 
  not all i do , sometimes i drink the blood of christian babies too, 
  amazing how you guys always find a way to shit on the muslims , even in completely unrelated topics * english racists attack poles ? 
  but the muslims ... *, 
   science , medicine , architecture , astronomy , mathematics , art , law , etc were flourishing during the years of the empire 's expansion and the classical studies of the antiquity never ceased to be cultivated during the byzantine times . 
  the stagnation started a long time ago with justician , who [ basically said `` fuck you '' to science ] ( https://books.google.de/books?id=otmyddmdw6yc&amp;pg=pa41&amp;dq=justinian+decided+not+to+pay+the+salaries+of+science+teachers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewirqcd5rfboahxb1xqkhwpmbreq6aeiitaa#v=onepage&amp;q=justinian%20decided%20not%20to%20pay%20the%20salaries%20of%20science%20teachers&amp;f=false ) . 
  there is not much to be said for `` science '' , mathematics and art . 
  there is the hagia sophia ( and it is pretty awesome , i 've seen it twice ) but this and any other things you can dig up are small blips on 14 long centuries . 
  all these centuries and so little to show for it . 
  we do n't hear about it because it was christianity who was the cause of this , yet this is a largely non-pc view because it offends both greek and the global christian sensibilities . 
  the classical torch was passed down to muslim arabs who where the first to actually do science during their [ golden age ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_golden_age ) . 
  but this is not even mentioned in our schools iirc . 
   and byzantine economy was the most advanced in all europe and the mediterranean for centuries . 
  its maritime trade was unmatched , exports were massive , and its place as the western terminus of the silk road gave the empire a great amount of wealth and prosperity . 
  true but it was n't the ottomans that made them stagnate . 
  first the italians started taking our trade away , then the rest of our european christian brothers [ finished the job ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_constantinople_ ( 1204 ) ) . 
   these `` politicians '' ( however much i do n't like them , and i really do n't like russia ) are using the phones in a socially acceptable manner both here and in the us , the guy who played pokemon go , and uploaded it to his youtube channel , did not ... 
  it might be socially acceptable because the people are accustomed to seeing elites pull this shit . 
  but religiously speaking it is not acceptable . 
  the context does not make a difference here ; either you are a politician who uploads it to his facebook page ( with the best of intentions , i grant ) or a dude trolling the russian laws , it is still easter and you do n't stick a cellphone on your damn face . 
  so since the issue is a purely social one , i attribute it to authoritarianism : fuck the little man . 
  but if you feel this way about these people i am sorry i misjudged you . 
   what a wonderful strawman !, 
  the brexit campaign come to think of it , the `` wonderful strawman '' would be a perfect name for that shit, 
  what is the alternative ? 
  if you ca n't manage a property for 50 + years , the smart thing to do would be to let someone else manage it . 
   even if we fucked up real good , in 100 years from now these airports would have brought in more than 1.4 bil , not quite . 
  we do n't even have to fuck up real good , if we just fuck up as we usually do , we wo n't even have a profit of 1.4 bil but more like a debt of 1.4 bil . 
  just like olympic airlines , who i think owed 2 billion or so . 
  just like you , i 'd love to see these airports generate a profit but as a citizen i 'd rather take a `` measly '' 1.4 bil rather than another huge debt on our backs . 
   it was not relevant to this discussion what do you mean ? 
  do you mean that there is there a discussion that `` cultural marxism '' is not relevant to ? 
  stop the presses !, 
  yes , orthodox religious art pieces . 
  the minor league of art . 
  the same portraits of men ( or women ? 
  hard to say ) who look either scared , or petrified and/or stoned . 
  the hands seem to either sprout from their waist or are [ locked in a weird position ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/de/a4/2b/dea42b815cf4540d538520be78de9bc7.jpg ) just like a [ hydralisk ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/be/hydralisk_ ( starcraft \\ ) . png ) ready to attack . 
  and hagiographers have been trying to change the `` hydralisk position '' for centuries , but to no avail . 
  tl/dr ; when talking about the stagnation of art , the most boringly dogmatic and depressingly unchanging type of art might be the best example . 
  there is this idea by western scholars , who mean well but are ultimately misguided , that leninism somehow runs contrary to orthodox marxism ( if there is a such a thing ) . 
  i think it 's just a futile attempt to make marxism more palatable to the modern western world , because decades of anti-communist propaganda have made people instinctively hostile to it . 
  so they are trying to present a beautified or fictionalized version of marxism . 
  the ussr did fail , after all , right ? 
  so it ca n't have been * real * socialism , right ? 
  anyway no sense in judging intentions here so let me be specific :  and while there 's no socialism in europe in a strict sense , obviuosly working conditions of people and social spendings of the nations hugely improved over past 100-150 years . 
  sounds like the typical social democrat argument , like something bernstein would say .
