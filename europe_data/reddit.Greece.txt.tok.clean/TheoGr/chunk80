  * you know what , capitalism ai n't so bad after all * . 
  this may or may not be true , we may or may not agree ( though i bet we both agree , i totally see what you are saying ) but ultimately it has nothing to do with marxism . 
  also marx acknowledged how powerful capitalism was , he was well aware that it could somewhat increase the immediate well-being of the proletariat , but that was not his long-term goal . 
   the problem with revolutionary nutjobs like lenin was that they attempted to skip capitalism and install socialism in underdeveloped nation . 
  as the whole idea to break everything and then try to build something on the ashes is ridiculous . 
  well then marx and engels are ridiculous too . 
  they repeatedly call for the proletariat to maximize industrial output as soon as they get their hands on the means of production . 
  what is the point of doing that if your society is already industrially developed ? 
  at the time , they considered england to be the only `` proper '' industrial country - france and germany were seen as more backward countries in which the proletariat was a minority of the population . 
  there is no industrialization level which is mandatory for a nation in order to embark on the road to socialism . 
  what they said was that different nations move at different speeds . 
  more importantly , marx [ acknowledged ] ( https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/11/russia.htm ) the possibility of a `` shortcut '' to communism for russia . 
  this is often overlooked . 
  so please do n't attribute to marx a deterministic or rather linear model of historical evolution . 
  this is something his detractors do . 
  it is perfectly normal to develop a `` doctrine '' for revolution for each specific country , based on its own peculiarities and circumstances . 
   and even lenin realized his mistakes and tried to re-implement capitalism-like system in russia after revolution ( this system was later dismantled by stalin ) . 
  lenin 's early policies were implemented during a nasty civil war . 
  so not only did the bolsheviks have to win the war , but they also had to survive . 
  i always found it hypocritical that modern analyses ( not talking about you btw , do n't get me wrong ) judge lenin 's early mistake so harshly . 
  this is a group of people with a very tenuous control over their country , attempting a new system while fighting on several fronts . 
  would they make mistakes ? 
  who the fuck would n't ?!, 
  our modern , extremely advanced and efficient capitalism still crashes from time to time . 
  and unlike lenin , nobody even attempts to improve the situation . 
  anyway , some years later , when nep had repaired the economy and the industrial output , stalin chose to abandon it since it had fulfilled its purpose . 
   so , if socialism ever comes to existence it will be result of evolution not revolution . 
  again , this sounds great but it has nothing to do with marxism . 
  marx and engels make it very clear that the proletariat - who might very well be a minority of the population - should take control of the means of production . 
  democracy may or may not help . 
  it is literally in the communist manifesto itself . 
  i mean let 's forget all the theoretical shit . 
  in the 21st century we have seen mind-boggling increases in productivity . 
  [ people are considering handing out money ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/finland-to-consider-introducing-universal-basic-income-in-2017-a6963321.html ) because there is simply too much stuff and someone has to buy it if the system is to keep going . 
  it is insane . 
  yet , were have we seen evidence of this evolution ? 
  nowhere . 
  if nothing else , marx has been proven correct in this regard . 
   speaking on the majority of at least 85 % . 
  why does it have to be exclusionary ? 
  if you ask people : do you feel european or < native nationality  ? 
  obviously the vast majority would answer the former . 
  but why ca n't you be both ? 
  and the irony of a fucking brit - of all people - questioning this . 
  you live in a god damn union ( ni , scotland , wales , england , you know what those things are right ? ), 
  all inside a united kingdom * and * in a fucking commonwealth of independent sovereign states . 
  do you not see the parallels ? 
  any bells ringing ? 
  can you not imagine how people might identify on different levels with different institutions ? 
   you 've been on this sub for ages and it 's easy to tell you are some middle-class lefty who fucking loves the eu despite being greek . 
  hell yes . 
  fucking proud of it too . 
  unlike many `` concerned citizens '' in this sub i do n't hide my identity nor do i pretend to be something i am not ( i.e. 
  * i 'm not a racist but but but but deport all muslims now !, 
  * ) just to gain karma in a ridiculous attempt to push my agenda . 
  the well-being of the people europe first ( and the people of the plant second ) is my agenda . 
  i think the eu contributes to that . 
  if it does n't , well let 's get rid of it asap . 
  i am not ashamed or embarrassed of what i am . 
  keep this in mind . 
  once again , you 'll thank me later . 
  in europe , generally speaking , communism is dead . 
  ( yes greece is [ a notable exception ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communist_party_of_greece ) but we always are the exception ), 
  well said . 
  thank you . 
   typical greek thinking it was all about antiquity and the middle ages were all `` dark '' . 
  whether we agree or not , i have to say this , for the record : it 's not typical greek thinking at all . 
  modern greek culture takes a lot of pride in our middle age history and does not regard that era as `` dark '' at all . 
  my opinion is , sadly , a minority opinion . 
  i was referring to [ this picture ] ( https://i.imgur.com/bg8oo1b.jpg ) that someone else posted, 
  i see what you are saying and i 'd also like greece to reap the profits of these airports . 
  however our chronic mismanagement of , well , literally everything in our country , makes that sound unlikely . 
  but i am not doubting you , since i ca n't see the future . 
  i guess we 'll find out in 3 years if this was a smart move or not . 
  and by then , it will be already too late . 
   to whom ? 
  and why ? 
  i assumed you are familiar with what imperialism is . 
  if you are not , i ca n't really be bothered to tell you about it . 
  please google it or something . 
   consider that the upward trend in living standards started long before our current globalism . 
  so clearly we can do without imperialism . 
  great !, 
   last time i checked the russian military does use tanks and not cavalry , but i may be wrong . 
  putin is a real sad excuse of an imperialist , if you compare him to the so-called `` second world '' that the ussr created . 
  he is basically trying to create regional low-level conflicts to bolster his own popularity ratings . 
  but i understand he is considered something like an `` alpha male '' hero among the alt-right ? 
  well let 's try and imagine the uk reinstating the british empire by re-colonizing india . 
  oops you just got nuked . 
  yes , because during the byzantine era we really improved `` science , art and economic progress '' that we inherited from the classical times !, 
  oh wait no we did n't , it is a very complicated subject we the bottom line is that we did embarrassingly little with the treasures that were given to us . 
  most of the progress was in the areas of administration , warfare and medicine ( because of warfare ) . 
  why ? 
  well most people were too busy debating [ the nature of undead carpenters ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monophysitism ) to ridiculous lengths , also whether or not you should be allowed [ to draw paintings of said carpenter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/byzantine_iconoclasm ) . 
  not to mention the regression of art , it took ~ 8 centuries to go from [ this glorious statue ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hermes_and_the_infant_dionysus ) to tiny scribblings [ embedded on chests ] ( https://www.phorum.gr/fetchimg?src=ahr0cdovl2h1bwlkznj1axquzmlszxmud29yzhbyzxnzlmnvbs8ymdewlza3l2rzyzayndg0lmpwzw%3d%3d ) . 
  because , you know , the christian cult took offence to man-size statues with dicks so we had to be very , very careful as to what we create . 
  i know what our school teaches us when it comes to history . 
  the official narrative is that our progress was cut short by the ottomans . 
  this is historically untrue . 
  we had already stagnated .
