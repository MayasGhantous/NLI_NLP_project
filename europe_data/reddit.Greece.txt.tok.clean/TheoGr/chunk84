  `` hurr durrr just because we love our country does n't mean we are racists hurr '' . 
  it is always the same . 
   did you politicians spend all your education money on cars and women ? 
  yes :( we had no money left to fund the `` they are all white so the crime ca n't be racist '' curriculum, 
   you are one of the dumbest people i have had the displeasure of reading on here . 
   edit : how was it racist when most eu migration is white people ? 
  god damn talk about being dense as a neutron star . 
  username checks out first its `` its not racist because islam is not a race '' now its `` its not racist because they are all white '' dude you are starting to generate your own gravity well , be careful, 
  umm no ? 
  wtf, 
  people happily pretend to be secular until its christiantiy on the line , then the tune changes to `` but its our tradition , respect it , i am not a christian but ... '' and all that shit, 
  you really do n't see it do you ? 
  how much your narrative changes if you even suspect they are `` natives '' it 's like , no big deal , this shit happens , what can you do just imagine if they were muslim/arab teens . 
  deport all muslims now !, 
  and you never know , they might end up being immigrants , in which case we 'll see the comments here doing a full 180, 
  ah yes , i expected the leftist media to label these concerned citizens as racists . 
  typical . 
  just because they dared to criticize mass migration does not mean they are racists . 
  i do n't condone murder or anything ** but ** the more you push the proud native europeans to the brink of extinction , by importing millions of raping criminal elements inside their communities , the more such `` pushback '' you will encounter . 
  the people are fighting back !, 
  edit : how sad is it that i need to write ** / s ** ? 
  i removed the `` white '' part because i realized it could lead to such misunderstandings . 
  sadly my edit was not fast enough : /, 
  i kind of hated the religious indoctrination i received in my school ( in another officially christian country ) but what can i say . 
  whatever floats your boat man i mean i still enjoyed christmas outside school ... it 's mostly a thing for friends and family anyway ... not sure why we need to institutionally brainwash kids to enjoy that aspect of our culture , when we can totally do it as free citizens whenever we want, 
   i really think some people jump to conclusions way too soon on reddit . 
  somehow i do n't think you 'd be saying the same thing if there was a muslim involved . 
  * hurrr durr deport all muslims * now that the murderers are potentially proud nationalists , the reaction changes to * hey guys do n't jump to conclusions !, 
  * ( btw i personally do n't claim anything about the attackers , i like to wait for the official story ), 
  no that goes only for islam, 
  if greeks were smart we would re-join the ottoman empire and destroy it from the inside by absolutely ruining your economy, 
  i do n't follow , you said you are glad that the uk does not ban christmas so you can enjoy them ? 
  can you enjoy them or not ? 
  are they banned or not ? 
  also i ca n't play death metal at school , does n't mean death metal is banned in greece . 
  you see where i am going with this, 
  yeah but people tried the whole `` league of nations '' thing in the past and it failed . 
  nato has done fuck all for greece and turkey who have actually fought ( yes , two nato members actually had an [ armed conflict ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_invasion_of_cyprus ) , it 's crazy right ? ), 
  nukes are great at preventing industrial warfare , no disagreements there , but you still have cold wars or low level violence . 
  see usa vs ussr and [ ussr vs china ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sino-soviet_border_conflict ) . 
  scary shit . 
  yet nothing like that in europe . 
  must be our good luck again ? 
  plus only 2 countries ( uk and france ) have nukes . 
  recently , more countries host `` shared '' nukes but they ca n't use them at all so sorry but we should have seen some european violence by now , even if would n't involve the uk or france due to their nukes . 
  so i do n't buy that a league of nations v2 is the reason we enjoy peace . 
  we tried that shit and it did n't work . 
  on the other hand , we never tried something like the ecsc , it is a really revolutionary idea and it demonstrably benefited our civilization, 
  you are still free to say merry christmas . 
  christmas is not banned in the usa . 
  jesus christ stop watching fox news . 
  you are one of us . 
  do n't sink to their level man, 
   she is literally hitler . 
  i lol ` ed at this it would be awesome if hitler came back as an female french politician . 
  the ultimate con, 
  do you think christmas would disappear otherwise ? 
  yeah that 's like comparing runners in the special olympics sure some are faster than others ... but ... you know ... 
  i wo n't say it , use your imagination , 
  so its just a coincidence that we stopped having these terrible wars once the eu ( or rather the ecsc ) was formed lucky us , i guess ? 
  but muh yurpean traditions, 
   that 's what i meant , there is no nuance anymore you are either mainstream or far right and that is throwing harmless people who are either nationalists or just critical of immigration into one pot with people burning down refugee homes and celebrating hitler that is one narrative , one designed to paint the left in a negative light and deny the validity of any accusations of racism . 
  the other side , the one i see daily , is that people pretend to be `` concerned citizens '' and wildly cheer on the firebombing of refugee shelters while saying `` we are just criticizing immigration '' . 
  i saw this in greece with the rise of the golden dawn . 
  a lot of their insane far right ideologues pretended to be `` concerned citizens '' who were simply `` skeptical of unchecked mass migration '' while they stabbed ( legal ) immigrants to death . 
  this conflation is what helps the real far right . 
  the ones that are in the center ( or claim to be ) are the far right 's best allies by simply ignoring the space they are creating for them . 
   imagine we called all social democrats communists and threw them into one pot with antifa and linksautonome ? 
  this is done constantly . 
  if you are not a nationalist , you are lumped in this huge group called `` traitors to your country '' . 
  it does n't matter if you are a progressive leftist or a molotov-wielding anarchist , you are exactly the same , a traitor who is part of a global shady cultural marxist conspiracy designed to bring down the proud white nations . 
   the problem was a german one . 
  tax havens or simply tax evasion is a german problem ? 
  i like how balls first praises the ingenuity of your solution , gets germany and everyone else to accept it , and then plays the victim to germany and co. . also how do you even get elected with such a name ? 
   some jewish bankers too , though i guess that 's a bit old-fashioned these days . 
  just `` bankers '' or just `` financial elites '' , please . 
  sometimes i think these terms are used as codewords for `` jews '' , but that is another discussion ... 
  i do n't care . 
  yes , hearing people claim to be `` genderfluid '' sounds retarded to me too ... but i am not the thought police . 
  i mean many things sound retarded to me . 
  what do you want me to do ? 
  anyway since this shit does not affect you in the slightest , why do you get so offended about it ? 
  also ,  vag\u00edna what is that weird '' \u00ed '' on your vagina ? 
  why did you even mention hitler ? 
  back in your day , the far right celebrated hitler 's birthday . 
  what does that mean in relation to today 's far right ? 
   it was a victory for germany who solved its tax problem wait what ? 
  the uk 's solution was chosen in the end . 
  you had it your way . 
  not germany . 
  its strange to me how ( despite having it your way more often than not ) your press still manages to find ways to shit on germany and the eu . 
  well that 's a great solution . 
  just drop them back . 
  it 's not like they will do exactly the same thing ( i.e. 
  cross the fucking sea ) next day , is it ? 
  no , they will stay home and magically fix their problems did you email the frontex director with your solution yet ? 
  do it quick , you will save a lot of innocent lives, 
  good luck with that , getting the proud sovereign nations to cooperate on anything . 
  we could n't even create a refugee quota system because everyone , including the proud patriots of eastern europe , refused to cooperate . 
  despite benefitting from the eu immensely , that is .
