  they are going to enact policies as if the majority of the country honestly supported them because they have every legal right ( and obligation ) to do so . 
  honestly this is n't so much politics as common sense . 
  voting is not a game . 
  what do you mean ? 
  he does n't praise hitler , therefore he ca n't be far right . 
  he is just another `` concerned citizen '' . 
  the meaning has not changed that much over the years , despite what the angry nationalist brigade wants to tell you . 
  [ refugee home are burned down ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/germany-222-refugee-homes-burned-or-attacked-arrests-a6763506.html ) and people [ cheer on ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/12167405/anti-migrant-mob-in-germany-cheered-as-refugee-shelter-burned-down-in-front-of-them.html ) , especially in / r/europe where burning houses with refugee families in it is labelled `` concerned citizens being critical of immigration '' . 
   celebrated hitler 's birthday yeah there is no reason to worship a historical persona anymore . 
  this is another strawman . 
  far right = worshiping hitler . 
  nope . 
  you do n't have to celebrate his birthday to be right or far right . 
  but it is conveniently sold to us this way , like `` i do n't praise hitler , therefore i ca n't be a racist '' . 
  nobody gives a shit about hitler and the people who mention him like 99 % are angry nationalists trying to be sarcastic . 
  this is so true . 
  romanians and bulgarians were foaming at the mouth against the refugees when they were literally in the same wretched place 2 or 3 decades ago . 
  of course . 
  i mean , it was `` too much diversity '' that caused our financial collapse . 
  if he had less diversity , the 2008 crisis would never have affected us and the troika would never have imposed its will upon our proud motherland . 
  so it 's only natural for the wise and proud patriotic greek people to be against diversity . 
  edit : / s , if the sarcasm was not obvious enough, 
  what do the refugees have to do with diversity ? 
   if you need something , ask . 
  i got it all man !, 
  can i ask you to lie less ? 
   however , countries are bound to have both types of diversity . 
  we find that countries that are ethnically homogenous but ** diverse in values orientation ** are the ** best innovators ** . 
  pretty funny that you are downvoted for asking a question . 
  these are the same people who constantly complain that they are shut off a discussion by being unfairly labelled `` racists '' . 
  they love their closed-minded circlejerk . 
  just do n't dare to question the ridiculous reactionary narrative and you will be fine : * a dark conspiracy of globalist liberals are enforcing diversity upon the native proud patriotic population to break their indomitable patriotic spirit * . 
  who said it is a goal in itself ? 
  yeah no . 
  even if we had twice our numbers ( extreme unlikely to happen , but just saying ) we still could n't do shit about that what we need is a decent economy and better alliances ( eu ) to ensure territorial integrity, 
   he 's swedish - you can deduce this from the comment . 
  so actually i doubt it will backfire on him directly . 
  i know . 
  i usually search someone 's post history because more often than not , they are americans . 
  can you even imagine the trolling ? 
  there are a lot of people invested in this and all of them speak english . 
  when brexit starts , the flaming and trolling will reach unprecedented levels . 
  this place will be a warzone . 
  personally i 'm saving a lot of such messages . 
  i will send him a pm every day with all the shit he has wrote , just to remind him how wrong he was . 
   like how germany makes tens of billions off greece 's debt lol i never thought i 'd find a british tsipras supporter . 
  or are you just grasping at straws ? 
   the delusional leftist dream of a great big federation it 's like everything you disagree with is somehow `` leftist '' . 
  ridiculous  brexit was a fresh wind . 
  why do n't you wait until it actually happens ? 
  i am saving these comments . 
  you guys have talked so much shit , you do n't even realize how its going to backfire against you once shit hits the fan, 
  it 's funny that you guys keep saying that the eu will collapse `` soon '' but do n't even know when you will leave the eu . 
  do n't expect many people to trust you . 
  you tried to bring the eu down with your hissy fit and you failed . 
  all i can say to you now is ... good luck . 
  far left ? 
   the petty mentality a lot of pro-eu citizens have did you not understand me the first time ? 
  the `` petty mentality '' is a result of your utmost contempt for our institutions and our values . 
  i know there a lot of trumptards and far-right trolls that distort the discussion ( they are the loudest , after all ) but many europeans actually like the eu . 
  of course we criticize it a lot , but we generally like it . 
  it 's a good deal for many of us . 
  so tl/dr ; if you keep shitting on us , we 'll get mad . 
  you think we are petty against the uk , but in reality we are not nearly as insulting as you have been towards the eu . 
   why even bother criticising a country which is much more successful than yours because i can ? 
  it 's a discussion ? 
  i mean you are free to whine about the eu all you want nice to see how little you value free public discourse , though i did n't expect anything better from a brit, 
   yes because that 's how rational democracies work that is rich coming from a ` rational democracy ' who went on a hissy fit and left the eu due to some fake numbers printed on a bus . 
  if you are a ` rational democracy ' i 'd rather stick to tyranny , thank you very much . 
   seriously , fuck this sub . 
  i did n't even vote leave . 
  i swallowed all the bullshit about unity and solving problems . 
  empty words . 
  i like how literally no one of you voted leave . 
  it 's always the same : * i did n't vote leave , but ... * . 
  do you understand how transparent you are ? 
  you kept trash talking and insulting anyone and anything european , and now you have the nerve to get mad when people fire back ? 
  gtfo . 
  good riddance . 
  where is the far left ? 
  i am not the one bragging about my country 's soft power . 
  i know my country sucks balls . 
  i mean we tried to bully macedonia around and failed even at that . 
  you are the one that is bragging though , so i felt the need to bring you down to reality . 
  your diplomacy is , so far , embarrassing . 
  you shoulnd ' t even use the term `` soft power '' except if you are making jokes , like the country whose population went on a collective hissy fit because `` hurr durr too many foreigners '' and soured its reputation and relations with the most powerful trading bloc of the world . 
  i think you still live under the illusion of `` rule britannia ! '', 
  and it will take a couple of years ( and couple of bitchslaps ) to realize what you have done . 
  me , i already know my country sucks , i knew it way before the 2008 crisis . 
  it is time for you to learn the same lesson , 
   soft power is a beautiful thing . 
  you mean like pissing off the rest of the eu ? 
  is that using your power wisely ? 
  i have the feeling that when brits talk about `` soft power '' they basically mean `` become the lapdog of the usa ' . 
  tell that to our nationalists here . 
  the moment the population drops , they start raging against feminism and women who have become whores because they dare have a career and not breed all day . 
  you ca n't win when it comes to the population numbers . 
   sucks for you to tell them they were never really `` in '' . 
  sounds like you were n't paying attention to politics . 
  i ca n't blame you .
