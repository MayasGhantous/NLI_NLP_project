  i did n't say it was propaganda . 
  you are fucking paranoid . 
  and yes , the fact that they will ( ? ), 
  cost billions of $ does paint them in a negative light . 
  it 's also true . 
  guess what ? 
  something can be true * and * make someone look bad at the same time . 
  this is how reality functions sometimes . 
  my point , which you did n't get , is that redditors ignore everything sch\u00e4uble ( and other politicians ) have to say unless it is negative towards refugees . 
  it is very hypocritical and transparent . 
  [ you do n't have to cover the face ] ( https://liveraf.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/1303504479-web_kkk_rally009.jpg ) . 
  you 'd be fine . 
  i suck at math, 
   it 's one thing americans do better than us europeans . 
  except when the `` freedom of expression '' has the capacity to actually threaten the system , like with communism during the cold war . 
  in that case , oops , your `` freedom of expression '' means nothing . 
  enjoy your state repression of `` wrong '' ideologies and mccarthyism . 
  transparent excuses . 
  sch\u00e4uble and co. said a bunch of things , but 99,9 % of them are rejected or ignored because they are politicians who are `` traitors to their country '' and `` corrupt oligarchs '' or `` pawns of the globalist elite '' . 
  but the 0,1 % of their words , the ones that paint refugees in a negative light i.e. 
  the ones that redditors * actually agree with * are accepted unquestionably . 
  so yeah , this is what is wrong with our societies and the way we do politics . 
  irrationality and insane partisanship . 
  hate speech from an imam ? 
  \\ #deportallmuslims hate speech from a ~ ~ right-winger ~ ~ concerned citizen ? 
  \\ #butmuhfreedomofspeech \\ #stopoppressingme \\ #imnotaracistbut, 
   why is a greek less worthy of our help than a syrian ? 
  because greeks do n't want your help . 
   do n't blame the redditors for the raising tax comments . 
  convenient huh ? 
  do n't blame the redditors who bought whatever the media told them , because it conveniently suited their preconceived notions . 
  now that reality has proven them wrong , what do we hear ? 
  crickets . 
  or you , trying to tell us how it was an honest mistake lol . 
  not only is not inexcusable , but this is what is wrong with the western world . 
  too many people getting irrationally angry at headlines instead of educating themselves . 
  they are not sending a message to muslims . 
  isis could give less of a fuck about the burkini , i mean they are burning people alive for fun , you think they are somehow bothered by this lol . 
  the point of this bad is to appease the angry local mob , people like / u/mathem _ . 
  it is politics based on aggressive whining . 
  it 's not about political movements because there are none . 
  the message is : `` ma'am ... the people are panicked and decided to force you to remove your clothes so they can feel safer when it comes to terrorism . 
  what ? 
  does n't make sense ? 
  who gives a shit . 
  my boss has votes to solicit . '', 
  what a sight , a policeman forcing a woman to undress . 
  it is sad when your personal political ideology leads you to support things like this . 
  i mean should n't there be a moment when you stop and go `` hey , is this really ok '' ? 
  let 's hope it happens to your mother , wife or daughter one day . 
  having a policeman order your mother to take her clothes off because it offends the rest of the mob . 
  i hope that happens so that we can be there and cheer on . 
   and what is the reasoning behind ` safe spacing ' the beach of all places , and not the rest of the public space ? 
  it seems so arbitrary . 
  the reasoning is `` muslims '' . 
  people are fine with thoughcrime , safe spaces , authoritarianism , the government telling you what to do and what to wear , collectivism , surveilance etc ** as long as its done against a group of people they dislike ** . 
   i just identify as myself and now despise anything that is culture and traditions . 
  while being a trump supporter . 
  makes absolute , perfect sense / s but / r/europe loves nothing more than an immigrant telling us how bad migration is . 
  it 's like the ultimate fantasy . 
  so enjoy your karma . 
  yes , lets rewrite history to instruct the next generations that nationalism had nothing to do with ww1 . 
  orwell would be proud . 
  nice cherry picking of politicians . 
  but it does n't work . 
  the two big nations were the uk and germany - both intensely nationalist for their own different reasons . 
  the balkans that provided the pretext for the war had surging nationalist movements . 
  irredentism was particularly virulent , see : greece . 
  i could elaborate but i suspect this is another trollish attempt to push an agenda so i wo n't bother . 
   but the notion that the left is n't nationalist is absolutely illiterate . 
  ah / r/europe , the paradox of the left : both nationalists and traitors to their own nation at the same time . 
  or rather , whichever time suits the agenda !, 
  i 've asked you repeatedly to give examples , like demonstrate what you mean , yet all you say is `` but you do n't understand !, 
  you do n't understand ! '' . 
  karma whoring confirmed . 
  i hope you enjoyed our discussion ( i see you farmed some extra karma ) because i sure did n't . 
  personally i do n't buy this distinction . 
  i think that ww1 is the natural , expected outcome if the continent is dominated by nationalists . 
  it 's not that they were `` bad '' nationalists , it 's that there were too many of them in too many positions of power . 
  now i am not implying that you are a hate-filled fascist or are trying to cover up for them . 
  quite the contrary . 
  i 'd expect a similar thing to happen if everyone was an anarchist . 
  yeah there are the `` good '' kind of anarchists who do n't firebomb people but if tomorrow everyone in europe was an anarchist you 'd have horrific shit going down . 
  also ,  this is ok nationalism this is national anthem , not nationalism . 
  you can sing your anthem , have a national identity , enjoy your culture etc without having a political affiliation even . 
  even communists can be patriotic , i would know , we have a very vocal communist party here in greece . 
  on the other hand a `` nationalist '' is a specific kind of ideologue that believes certain things regarding his ( and the people who share his views ) rights to determine the dominant culture in the country he was born in . 
  it 's a specific ideology , not a song , so you ca n't compare them , is really all i am saying, 
   mostly because of the efforts of centrists you mean nationalists . 
  whatever we consider today as right-wing was what dominated the continent back then . 
  it was n't a centrist war at all . 
  everyone fought and died for `` god , king and country '' . 
   that 's not my point . 
  at all . 
  you 're talking to someone with research in ai/machine learning ... that you think that was my point shows how fruitless this conversation is . 
  dev here , sorry but your alleged credentials on the internet do n't make your point more valid . 
  i am not impressed . 
  your point was :  it 's quite ironic how people will misuse statistics trying to show others to be dumb . 
  you accused him of misusing statistics . 
  well go ahead and use your understanding of bayesian statistics to demonstrate that this alarmism is warranted .
