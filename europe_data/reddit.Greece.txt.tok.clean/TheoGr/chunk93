  now , erdogan says the same and suddenly we are upset about it ? 
  the irony . 
  nope , you are just trolling with a specific political agenda in mind you are british and not german . 
  the uk has taken ~ 5,000 syrian refugees and has promised to take a maximum of 20,000 . 
  yes , these are ** thousands ** . 
  a tiny and insignificant number . 
  of course you already know this , you already know how little your country has done and how you personally have not been affected at the slightest by these 5,000 refugees ( how could you ? 
  the uk has ~ 64 ** million ** inhabitants , five thousand people are nothing compared to that ) so you adopt a german flair and troll here ranting about millions of muslim brown refugee rapists , raping and killing every white person in sight . 
  this behavior should be banned because its obviously dishonest agenda pushing but be thankful that / r/europe is tolerant and lets you troll to your heart 's consent . 
   i do n't care who started it seems like it . 
  but you complain anyway edit : i just saw that in another sub you have an english flair and claim to have voted for brexit . 
  here you pretend to be a german . 
  troll much ? 
   i do , just not for being called a racist again , this seems kind of dishonest considering your whole point was complaining and extrapolating into a societal issue , what some `` friends '' of yours allegedly said  most of my `` alleged feminazi friends '' do call men misogynistic and they do say the word patriarchy at least five times a day . 
  are there many men perpators ? 
  undoubtedly . 
  however refugees do commit disproportionately more crimes ( sources in the description ) . 
  yup , typical reply . 
  exactly as i predicted . 
  * yes , men cause violence to women but but but but quick change the subject and blame only immigrants !, 
  * also  ( sources in the description ) umm more like studies done in 2014 ( before we the refugee crisis hit europe ) about immigrants ( not refugees specifically ) presented by the very impartial and objective `` angryforeigner '' youtube persona are , in your world , `` facts '' and `` statistics '' as i said , you are transparent . 
  within 10 seconds i exposedy your lying . 
   all i am saying is that instead of realizing that there is a problem we call each other `` nazi '' , `` commie '' or `` racist '' . 
  nobody is doing that . 
  what your `` friends '' called you has no bearing on public policy . 
   about womens safety ? 
  i must be an idiot considering i am a woman ... and ? 
  a lot of women do n't care about women 's issues and are in fact more sexist than men your gender does not grant you special status . 
  i ca n't believe you used that as an argument but then again this is / r/europe = basically a support psychology group for people who have been `` unfairly '' labelled racist by their mean friends * sheds tear *, 
  you seem to give a lot of flying fucks , that was your whole issue . 
  also , why are you mistakenly saying `` we call each other names '' ? 
  your friends called you a racist , not us . 
  your alleged friends , that is , since your post is just an anecdote . 
  there are always women afraid to go out . 
  but you shut them off , marginalized them and discarded their experiences completely by labelling them `` hysterical feminazis '' who `` hate men and the patriarchy '' . 
  now that the perpetrators are muslims/refugees , you pretend to care . 
  how transparent . 
  so somebody called you a racist ( allegedly ) and you come to / r/europe to complain about it ? 
  nice to see that half the `` discussions '' here are misunderstood `` concerned citizens '' who complain about being called racist, 
  well i mean considering that half of the foreigners are men , then she hates them too ? 
   it 's only the ` good ' and average greek people suffering from all this who said this ? 
  ah yes , the `` political class '' created the civil war in syria and also started global warming, 
  how can you chase your own friends and family ? 
  people enjoy the fantasy of there being a small clique of elites ( you can call them `` bankers '' or `` politicians '' or `` oligarchs '' , all equally interchangeable and meaningless titles ) who are responsible for everything bad that happens . 
  in reality , we greeks are against our own state . 
  we , the everyday citizens . 
  we oppose , mistrust , refuse to cooperate and are generally opposed to our own state . 
  we do n't like it . 
  actually we hate it . 
  one can say that there are good reasons to be like this , that this hostile behavior against our state is warranted . 
  there might be good reasons to not want to pay tax to a corrupt state . 
  there might be good reasons for us being major tax-evaders . 
  i get it . 
  but sadly it is beside the point . 
  the point is that it is impossible to have efficient tax collection , and thus proper welfare and services , if you are ideologically against your own state - your own government - functioning . 
  this is a literally unsolvable problem . 
  there is nothing in our culture or history or education that can help us deal with this problem . 
  no one can help us . 
  not even the other eu countries can help because it will be interpreted as `` hurr durr violating sovereignity !, 
  ! 11 '' and `` herp derp the evil germans are meddling in our own internal affairs ! 1 '' . 
  nothing can be done . 
  we have fucked ourselves over and have made it impossible to escape this fucked up situation . 
  allright who is left ? 
  you seem to blame everyone except the police . 
  leftists , the media , the establishment , etc , have you blamed `` political correctness gone mad '' yet ? 
  also its not hyperbole . 
  open your eyes and ears and you will see how many people literally believe what i just wrote , down to the letter . 
  but i guess even if you do you will somehow manage to blame the left again, 
  then is n't it weird that religion gets all the shit ? 
  i mean as a militant atheist i am very happy to shit on religion with you guys . 
  lets do it all day long . 
  i just find it a tad dishonest to ignore the cultural/hypermasculine aspects of it . 
  could it be because * some other religious people * also share this behavior , so they 'd rather focus all the attention on the pedophile prophet ? 
  just guessing ... 
  nah this is raw bs everybody and his mother knows what happened in bataclan and in the pulse shooting this is an insane discussion . 
  you keep playing the victim ( people are calling me racist ! ), 
  and its so ridiculous that you are now claiming bataclan was covered up since i remember the night it happened , within hours we knew who the perpetrators where , literally before the bodies were cold, 
  oh right , the objective and non-biased `` journalism '' of breitbart told everyone that there was a politically correct cultural marxist conspiracy to bring in muslims to rape your white women ... and you believed it, 
   you absolutely did not make sense here right now bu i will try to guess what you tried to say . 
  i am sorry if a syllogism was too much for you to handle . 
  let me try again . 
  you said that young people are not called upon to manage anything because they are too young . 
  you used government as an example . 
  that was literally your post , go read it again . 
  i then said : being a politician does not mean you are necessarily smart , maybe its a good thing to not be one ? 
  then you said , they are not stupid , just corrupt and detached . 
  which are allegedly non age-related things . 
  which is irrelevant , because our whole discussion was age-related . 
  so why bring politicians up in the first place ? 
  anyway its tiring explaining to you a simple discussion , so i 'll just say that i am happy that young people are starting to realize that old people are their enemies . 
  they do n't have their best interests at heart . 
  they have conflicting interests . 
  polls and studies show this . 
  but of course conservatives have this retarded notion that old = better . 
  who cares . 
  have a nice day . 
  you are such a victim . 
  use this hashtag : #oldbrexitlivesmatter, 
   you can try and blame it on masculinity or other complexes do you think its a coincidence that the believers in these religions exhibit a ( comically retarded ) hypermasculinity ? 
  hurr durr women should know their place , real men kick ass , praise god .
