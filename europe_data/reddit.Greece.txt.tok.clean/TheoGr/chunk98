  sadly , we have become used to this rhetoric by brexiters . 
   globalisation is the future . 
  then your country is heading towards the past . 
   we were no one , we had no power another brit being completely distanced from objective reality . 
  you were someone , a very strong country that was respected enough to be granted any special privilege you wanted . 
  you also had things go your way in the overwhelming majority of cases . 
  yet you still complain and talk shit about everyone . 
  hurr durr the eu is literally hitler . 
  well , good fucking riddance . 
  there is no political capital in the uk to be used for the things you mentioned . 
  they just ca n't afford it . 
  i mean you are obviously correct and that is what their politicians should do - in fact i think it 's what many of them want to do because it represents the best interests of the uk - but the people are simply not having it . 
  they dislike europeans . 
  the are distrustful of any continental country or government . 
  they are against foreigners . 
  if these problems were created by 15 of media propaganda then you need at least 30 years of media propaganda in the opposite direction to fix it . 
  good luck with that shit . 
   a pleasant lovely cooperative equality loving european cooperation project . 
  you should have thought of that before doing everything you could do destroy this project . 
  here is some advice : if you want the european project to be cooperative then but maybe try to fucking cooperate a little bit ? 
  instead of throwing hissy fits ? 
   i 'm surprised the uk public are n't up in arms about that . 
  the uk public seems to think that there was no need for a plan . 
  the typical excuse is `` well boris and farage were not part of the government , therefore why should they have a plan ? '' . 
  amazing right ? 
  it 's like idiocracy is not just a movie anymore . 
  quick , downvote this thread and post a dozen articles with dishonest immigrant criminal statistics !, 
  muslim immigrants are raping everybody , who cares about the economy and its stupid little `` numbers '' ? 
  yeah here 's the thing : you can assume responsibility ( like boris is doing now ) while doing a shitty job at the same time ( as we expect him to do ) . 
  there is nothing contradictory about it . 
   outgoing president wat, 
  i 've told this to many working class 40 year old greek people ( with families ) and they are ok with it . 
  it 's a chance , for most people the only chance they 'll get . 
  but do n't let that stand in the way of your anti-eu ideology . 
   the quality of life of the 52 % has reduced or stagnated . 
  again , not true . 
  where is your evidence ? 
  or is ideology more important that objective information ? 
   the problem in the uk is that globalisation and the free trade have hit the hardest the working class , which is now the workless class . 
  that is fiction . 
  reality is : 5.4 % unemployment rate , hundreds of thousands of job openings in the uk . 
  i do n't understand why people keep parroting that immigrants * took er jerbs , they tuk er jerbs !, 
  * like , are you for real ? 
  this is like a bad episode of southpark . 
  the so-called `` working class '' in the uk faces the same problems that workers face everywhere : they are quickly becoming obsolete due to transitioning to a service-based economy , something that the uk decided on its own . 
  not to mention automation that further reduces the need for unskilled labor . 
  it is very immoral and dishonest to blame immigrants for a non-existing reduction in wages or employment . 
  there are so many studies like [ this ] ( http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/sites/files/migobs/briefing%20-%20labour%20market%20effects%20of%20immigration_0.pdf ) , or [ this ] ( http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/ea019.pdf ) or [ this ] ( http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctpb21/reports/homeoffice06_03.pdf ) . 
  to quote just a single study :  the perception that immigrants take away jobs from the existing population , thus contributingto large increases in unemployment , or that immigrants depress wages of existing workers , do not find confirmation in the analysis of data laid out in this report . 
  this is a consistent conclusion across the studies . 
  funnily enough , another study says :  research does not find a significant impact of overall immigration on unemployment in the uk , but the evidence suggests that immigration from outside the eu could have a negative impact on the employment of uk-born workers , especially during an economic downturn so you just shot yourselves in the foot in the worst way possible . 
   the more dissatisfied jobless people there will be , there more problems there will be . 
  again , 5.4 % unemployment rate . 
  this is very close to full employment . 
  but there are `` just '' numbers , right ? 
  it 's just objective data . 
  who cares about data these days ? 
  feelings and emotions is where it 's at . 
  if the objective data get in the way of your ideology ... well , too fucking bad for the objective data !, 
  this objective data thing is just another inconvenience we 'll have to ignore . 
  but muh freedom of speech, 
   that 's because we 're the most hardworking people in europe . 
  i wonder if you actually believe that , like you read that oecd statistic and assumed it means we are the most hardworking . 
   now in all seriousness , i was bored at that time and i was thinking maybe it would be funnier if i presented a version which was closer to the truth . 
  it 's not closer to the truth really , i already explained why . 
  but i understand you had to defend our national pride . 
  other people do n't generally do this , they understand its just a joke . 
  huh . 
  til, 
  yup \u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b1 , very common never heard anyone calling it anything remotely like `` macedonia '', 
  dude i lived in greek macedonia ( hurr durr the only macedonia ) for 25 years and i 've been or lived in various places from [ kozani ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kozani ) to [ kavala ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kavala ) i also like to eat a lot do n't you think i would have fucking heard of this macedonia salat at least once ? 
  who the hell wrote this retarded article  fruit macedonia is a fresh fruit salad and is a common dessert in greece no its not , grew up in northen greece and i never ate anything called `` macedonia '', 
  see this is why i think greek people are mildly retarded . 
  there have been dozens and dozens of such maps in / r/europe . 
  all of them had humor , sarcasm and offensive things in them . 
  yet of all the european people its only greeks who get salty about such things and feel the need to correct them . 
  the top rated comment is a greek dude correcting the map to its `` real greek '' version . 
  seriously man . 
  no other people do this in / r/europe . 
  anyway i think its an interesting cultural observation . 
  personally , i interpret it as us being salty fucks due to our misplaced sense of national pride . 
  but opinions vary . 
  username checks out / s but seriously the image above is correct ... for the older generations . 
  the stereotype of the `` northen europeans '' being stingy workaholics was dominant until up to 5 to 10 years ago . 
  these europeans were bleak , unhappy people who worked too much . 
  this was contrasted to greeks were smart , sociable and able to enjoy life without working too much . 
  after the financial crisis and greece 's meltdown that shit was never mentioned again . 
  the stereotypes changed overnight to `` they all hate us and want to destroy our proud country '' . 
   it 's not . 
  90 % of people are in favor . 
  i hate to break this to you but having 90 % of your population demand that infants be ** mutilated ** is not a democracy . 
  this is a great example of mob rule . 
  i think every adult should understand the difference and its embarrassing that so many people agree with you . 
  this 90 % of the people simply do n't have the moral authority to mutilate defenseless kids no matter how they vote . 
  my aim was to let you know how i , and at least a couple of other folks here , feel about your attitude . 
  i do n't know where you got the idea that this was a debate . 
  if you think waiting is the uk 's unilateral decision to take , you deserve the vitriol you are receiving . 
  and if you have n't realized it already , i do n't care to feign politeness . 
  i leave that to you . 
  is it the same everywhere though ?
