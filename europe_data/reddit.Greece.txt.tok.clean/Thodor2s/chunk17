  that 's at least 2.000.000 euros of taxes that can be generated by the economic activity they create . 
  currently were trying to get as many tourists here as we can , why not bureaucrats , too ? 
  pfff . 
  that happened only once , and it was to cover the company 's ass , not ours . 
  but yeah i would n't trust any current greek government with keeping secrets like that . 
  if they ever lobotomize us and we elect a pasok government again we 'll give you a call . 
  although i may disagree with some of what you said , the last line is the truest statement one can make about the situation . 
  uhm ... no . 
  edit : k, 
  it 's not like those loans did n't come packed with enforced disastrous policies though . 
  my head hurts now from the facepalm . 
  well i just visited the center myself and i can attest that it does look freaking incredible up close , especially lighten up at night . 
  i was stricken however by the fact that they fell the need to paint the concrete gray because , and i quote my booklet here : `` when the architect saw the result he said that the concrete reflected more light that he envisioned , and it was n't gray enough '' wat !, 
  i see . 
  it 's because the greek government had hidden huge amounts of debt under the rug to join the a currency union without telling greek taxpayers and voters , and now greek taxpayers are waking up to the fact that they ca n't declare that debt odious or default on it because it has been transferred from the hands of banks to other european taxpayers against their will . 
  all of this lead to a great depression that is putting the entire european project under jeopardy and has cost greece a quarter of its gdp and a quarter of its jobs . 
  lmao . 
  ok i understand what you 're saying , here is the counter argument . 
  here is the example of architecture that is 99 % about form and 1 % about function . 
  here are some things he made in greece : [ the gates of nations ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/9e/67/23/9e6723a02faf773c8ce3e19de2aad4d6.jpg ) , [ the olympic stadium ] ( http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/j/msnbc/components/slideshows/_production/ss-090325-greece/ss-090325-greece-11.ss_full.jpg ) [ ( here it is on the inside ) ] ( http://www.stadia.gr/oaka/oakaworks37.jpg ) . 
  his works are undoubtedly pretty . 
  especially his latest like the path station in new york . 
  this guy is a sculptor first and foremost . 
  his buildings really are symmetrical , and beautiful , and are in essence big sculptures . 
  too bad they are a pain the the ass . 
  it took billions to erect the olympic stadium roof , and every year it takes millions to keep it standing . 
  [ they had to build it outside and then slide it inside its foundations ] ( http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/general-view-of-the-athens-main-olympic-stadium-which-will-host-the-picture-id50798413 ) . 
  it does n't cover all the seats and its shape makes the light constantly reflect inside it heating up the stadium to an unimaginable degree in the summer , so we had to darken the glass . 
  added to all of this it was over-budget , and was n't ready until the very last minute . 
  they were literally still bolting it in place hours before the opening ceremony of the olympics , years after the deadline . 
  and the most tragic of this is that it wo n't last , just like many of hist works . 
  the greek government already has a plan to demolish or replace the roof of the stadium with something more functional . 
  something that actually covers all the seats , and that does n't deform with every earthquake , and something that does n't need its cables changed or to be repainted every decade . 
  because that 's what architecture is . 
  function . 
  buildings are not mere sculptures meant to be seen perfectly from every angle or to merely symbolize something . 
  when i go into the kalatrava 's spans as we call them , i am not striked by the allegory of 2 abstract structures representing earth and uranus touching each other to create the world as in ancient greek mythology . 
  i am too busy thinking : `` wow , this is hot . 
  '' , `` wow look at the light reflecting on the glass . 
  '' , `` wow i am bling now . '', 
  you can always paint it a vibrant color like yellow or red or light blue . 
  i 'd love if this becomes a trend . 
  find brutalist and crappy concrete modern architecture and paint it all a single colour . 
   project that created hundreds of construction jobs and will now create permanent profitable businesses and jobs in the area that they greek government can tax . 
  and the public did n't pay a single euro thing for any of this . 
  lol did greece really need this ? 
  / s ^ / s ^ / s ^ / s, 
  will this meme ever die ? 
  can you at lease ctrl - f `` debnts '' and `` germoney '' in greek related threads to see if it 's already been said before making the same false remark for the billionth time ? 
  renzo piano is generally [ a big miss for a lot of people ] ( http://www.staging.phaidon.com/resource/ontourwithrp-p017.jpg ) . 
  his works really lack in aesthetics but architecture is n't always about aesthetics . 
  personally , i like how the building is essentially covered by a park . 
  [ and i think in the context of what it is and where it is , it 's good . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo0uqnl4jbm&amp;t=1m10s ), 
  well how about you put that / s at the end ? 
  there are idiots out there that make these comments for real . 
  by making arrangements with france , italy and benelux . 
  we should all start speaking `` english with a scottish accent \u2122 '' since it 's going to replace english as the eus official language . 
  `` the biggest and most noble thoughts ought to be expressed with the fewest words possible '' as we say here . 
  yes . 
  the national library will also move there in 2017 . 
  moving all those books takes time . 
   privately funded no , you do n't understand . 
  we 're absolutely broke , we could n't have built this in the past 3 years with public money if our life depended on it . 
  it 's not even funny . 
  now that you point it out , the park on the back really does look like a huge really organized gardening store ... 
  i can never unsee this now ... 
   even if the greek/cypriot government did n't veto turkish eu membership ... ima call my math professor , cause i think i just discovered a statement with negative probability ... brb . 
  if you look at it closely you can see it 's a hammer and sickle , which i do n't know how to take ... 
  western european time , man . 
  i mean cmon . 
  actually neither the eu or the greek or any other government ( why would they !? ), 
  paid a single cent for this . 
  it was entirely privately funded . 
  well yeah , we are . 
  but the opera [ is quite profitable ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1k6osd9jrg ) , and it 's not like the government actually paid for it . 
  you think ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4kxfhllsfq here is the design process of it . 
  i agree, 
  this system is n't good in the slightest . 
  it 's basically national government people holding excecutive power , somewhat being given , on the eu level , legislative power to share with a parliament . 
  so essentially our governments have become lawmakers of eu law , which they then get to also implement . 
  this is basically the core problem of the structure of the eu . 
  people who make and finalize the laws in essence , that would be the commission and the council and not so much the parliament , are also the ones who then get to implement them . 
  usually lawmakers hold the government accountable for the implementation of their laws , but in the eu , the lawmakers are the governments . 
  which is why the eu has a bunch of great laws in theory , and little works in practice . 
  maybe we can get france ans spain to run on wet . 
  it is their timezone after all ... 
  what strikes me about this is the disconnect between the opinion of age-groups in the uk vs our own bailout referendum last year . 
  last year in greece : ages 18-29 : 31 % voted yes to the terms of the deal , 69 % voted no to the terms of the deal . 
  ages 40-44 : 46 % voted yes , 54 % voted no . 
  ages 45-59 : 41 % voted yes , 59 % voted no . 
  ages 59 - ... : 63 % voted yes , 37 % voted no . 
  it could n't only be because of tsipra 's popularity and endorsement at the time . 
  this pattern shows up in other eu related questions as well . 
  can anyone explain this ? 
  yes yes yes yes !, 
  omg i swear to god scotland you have to do this !, 
  which is a wrong figure and the leave campaign absolutely said that this morning . 
  you ca n't make shit up .
