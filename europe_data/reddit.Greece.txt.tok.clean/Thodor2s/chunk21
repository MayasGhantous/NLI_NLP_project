  your very own all-inclusive with added privacy , a bed you can actually sleep on , and you did n't have to fly anywhere !, 
  i just saved you a thousand bucks , you 're welcome !, 
  i am not a tourism expert by any means , but i do n't think that all-inclusive hotels offer better services or are in any way better for the visitor than traditional hotels , not just in greece , but in general . 
  and there 's probably good reason why tourist giants of greece still operate hotels in cities with a non all-inclusive model . 
  that 's what sells !, 
  tourism companies that went to the all-inclusive model were out-competed by other places where work is cheaper and the government subsidizes the industry or gives generous tax-breaks . 
  not to mention the obvious : people just do n't visit greece to stay in one place for 10 days . 
  they move around , the go sightseeing to places like delphi , olympia , meteora and other landmarks . 
  they then would take a ferry and go to an island , where they would n't want to be in their hotel anyway , no matter how stellar it is . 
  and most of them [ are stellar ] ( http://santorinidave.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/2014/03/santorini-private-pool-jacuzzi.jpg ) . 
  touring like this takes for a much bigger wallet on behalf of the visitor than it would in all inclusive venues . 
  it also necessitates the existence of good infrastructure . 
  things like airports everywhere , ports and reliable ship services , high speed rail , reliable public transport , good roads . 
  we have all of those things here . 
  so non inclusive is what we do !, 
  because unlike most places , we can , and because that 's what people want !, 
  we get much more money per tourist , and we do n't directly compete with places with half our wages and a quarter of our taxes . 
  and honestly , if you visit greece just to stay in the same beach and hotel nearby for 10 days ... well ... everyone has different opinions . 
  and yours are wrong !, 
  did you know that meteora means `` suspended from above '' - '' [ suspended in air ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_aefn27_a8 ) '' ? 
  that 's because ancient greeks thought that some rocks naturally floated . 
  that 's where the word meteorite comes from . 
  rock that fell from the sky could only be rock that floated in the sky at some point after all , right ? 
  and also what is it with all those things suspended from the sky like water and those fuzzy things the clouds !? 
  i wish someone could predict the things that the floating objects do in the sky . 
  we might even call those people meteorologists !, 
  i know better than to reply to stuff like these , but ... well ... 
  remember how turkey claims that armenians killed was the result of war ? 
  well ... those turks killed in the balkans , unlike the armenians , really were victims of war and revolution . 
  i do n't know if you have noticed , but in all of these places [ ottoman turks were always a tiny minority ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/ethnic_map_of_asia_minor_and_caucasus_in_1914.jpg ) , a ruling class , and driving them back only happens in periods of war and destabilization of the empire itself , that lead to independence of said places or unification with nearby independent states . 
  in places with genuine muslim populations , where muslim groups were the majority in the balkans , [ that 's still the case ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/ernst-ravenstein-balkans-ethnic-map-1880.jpg ) , to this day . 
  the revolution of many countries against the ottomans in the style of other revolutions of europe at the time , like the french revolution , are n't christian crusades or attempts of ethnic cleansing , and mobs and unorganized militias killing or kicking their foreign ruling class out ** is n't genocide ** , or ** comparable to genocide ** in any way , or should ** lead to genocide ** in retaliation , or should ** justify genocide ** . 
  the ethnic cleansing of the christian and previously pagan populations of anatolia , an official policy of the late ottoman ruling class and of organized turkish militias is not in any way comparable with the exodus of the ottoman governors from the balkans , or ottoman millitary losses in the balkans . 
  those sneaky motherfuckers !, 
  they took their revenge after all !, 
  a human is for a lifetime but history is forever . 
  i have every right to destroy what i have built , even myself . 
  but i do not have the right to destroy what i have n't built . 
  in athens , life expectancy is the least of it . 
  the worst is what air pollution does to historical marble structures . 
  athens is a plateau surrounded by mountains where the heaviest emissions accumulate over time . 
  the very air becomes acidic , and [ corrodes marble surfaces ] ( http://www.mixanitouxronou.gr/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/erechteio-karyatides11.jpg ) . 
  and the more frequent occurrences of [ acidic rain ] ( https://socratic.org/questions/what-is-the-effect-of-acid-rain-on-statues-made-of-marble-calcium-carbonate-than ) in athens certainly do n't help . 
  all remaining statues or detailed works from the acropolis have been put into museums where archaeologists can protect them , with duplicates taking their place on the rock , and there is a lot we have done and continue to do to protect them from acidic air and rain . 
  but there is just so much marble out there from so many periods that moving it all into museums or enclosing it all on sight would be impossible , and the corrosion of structural pieces like columns is actually more dangerous , as they loose their weight baring capacity as they loose mass at the edges . 
  if we do n't drastically change the composition of the air of athens in the next 50 years , no restoration project will be able to keep up , and many of the already damaged and exposed irreplaceable ancient marble buildings may not be sound enough to survive earthquakes as they have for more than 2 millennia ... 
  the damage would be irreversible ... :(, 
  well they sure are n't important enough for merkel to show up in parliament . 
  yes please !, 
  come here !, 
  it 's lovely , safe , and we absolutely need your money !, 
  make sure to collect all of them receipts !, 
  i love how domestic issues are n't important and somehow we are . 
  [ source in english announcing it a while ago ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/207250/article/ekathimerini/news/thessaloniki-metro-project-ready-to-restart-after-delay ), 
  it 's not like shipping companies do n't get tax breaks elsewhere . 
  i am just happy that it dropped 2 % . 
   if only the military had launched a coup against tsipras too the economy might not be so fucked up right now . 
  aaaaaaand i 've read enough . 
  thanks for writing all of this . 
  i am sure it 's fun for you googling news stories on google , and that must make you a real expert on foreign politics . 
  me , personally , i always thought of the west as something more than petty political games . 
  i though of it as the right side of history . 
  for me , communism and authoritarianism are n't bad because they are less profitable than democratic rule , or because they make for enemies of democratic countries . 
  they 're wrong because they are immoral . 
  but i guess you 're right . 
  the decision to not anger the junta in greece , for americans at the time ... 
  it is justified . 
  and apology is kind of irrelevant , especially since the vast majority of the problems in greece , both at the time , and today , really are domestic . 
  it 's not that the americans forced the junta to behave like this , just tolerated it . 
  but if that 's the attitude of the west towards elected leaders , then i do n't want to be part of it anymore . 
  i am much more concerned with being at the right side of history , than i am with having westernman status . 
  and then bulgaria and greece called on the european defense treaty and the eu countries mobilized together for the first time against turkey , essentially creating the european army !, 
  glorious !, 
  i did n't want to reply to what was 99 % nonsense . 
   modern greece is barely 40 years old  modern greek culture has no connection to ancient or medieval greek culture  not realizing that modern greece was one of the first liberal democracies in europe  greeks like russia because of religious and cultural ties , how dare they do n't like the nations ** we ** have religious and cultural ties with !? 
   greeks feel humiliated by their low status in the world and find ways to blame others for it instead of themselves  the right and left in greece share a lot in common - they both hate the west and hate jews . 
   not understanding greek civil law and the fact that it 's based on the thousand yo tradition ceasar-o-papism , not secularism . 
   greece discriminates against atheists more than any other european country i can think of ... as a greek who is indeed atheist , i honestly loled here . 
  anyway , all pretty much uninformed nonsense . 
  i pardon it , simply because i do n't expect anyone to study my country 's modern history . 
  i just want to emphasize on this one thing , because it is especially shameful that people from other countries do n't get this :  it ca n't be the us support for the junta no , actually this is the number 1 reason why many greeks , including myself , express negative views of the usa . 
  we fought a civil war in the 50s for the right to democratic government and the people who helped us in that war then backstabbed us and took that right from us by force . 
  we had a pretty good thing going for us after the end of the civil war , and that junta ending that is a major fucking deal !, 
  it was n't internal , or a continuation of ww2 leadership like in other european countries . 
  it ruined our economy , raised the debt by more than 1000 % , part of which we are still repaying , tried to annex cyprus and split the country in half as a result , ended greece 's monarchic tradition , and was very close to dragging us to all-out war with turkey !, 
  all of that because we dared have a free and fair election in which a centrist coalition of parties entered parliament and had good prospects of forming a coalition government with democratic socialists . 
  it 's actually fucking amazing how you think i can easily get over that !, 
  those 10 years of clientalism , demagogy , and awful economic planning ruined my country for the next century !, 
  and the us has n't even apologized , not even for supporting and recognizing the junta !, 
  it 's frankly amazing how we have such good relations with the us after that . 
  the western world is my county 's greatest achievement . 
  so it goes without saying we do n't hate the west . 
  not even our most hardcore commies really despise the west or dispute our place in it . 
  but we do collectively hate what 's been done to it !, 
  free countries are supposed to act like the moral compass for the rest of the world , not as an opportunistic club that fights everyone else for money and control . 
  i consider myself hardcore right wing capitalist and i even i can tell you that much : we shouldnt be quick to dismiss marxist ideas of the wrongs or capitalism or consider the west infallible , and not all the enemies of the west were idiots . 
  so , did i vote for tsipras ? 
  fuck no !, 
  do i see his points and criticism as valid ? 
  fuck yes !,
