  will the next right givernment improve because if that criticism ? 
  fuck yes !, 
  and that is why i actually fucking love the west . 
  how is this comparable ? 
  northern cyprys is a state noone recognizes . 
  you ca n't trade with places you dint recognize !, 
  it 's a de facto embargo !, 
  also , trade with turkey did n't die after this . 
  we did n't put missiles on the border and we did n't provocate or retaliate !, 
  as soon as a democratic government took over in greece , we withdrew from the island completely , and to make sure that at some point the same happens to turkey , the best strategy is to get turkey as close to the west as possible !, 
  ( o_o ) 7, 
   greek exports to russia are minuscule . 
  precisely my point . 
  but every year more than 1,2 million russians visit greece spending more than a 1000 $ each directly into the greek economy . 
  and the prospect of raising that this year and the following years as well as exports of goods to russia are the greatest than any other country . 
  why pass on that ? 
  we need every penny that we can get right now !, 
  ok , let 's do dis the monument of the unknown soldier was commissioned in the year 1926 to be ready to be unveiled in the 10th anniversary of the end of the first world war in 1928 . 
  [ here is pic of it being built ] ( http://www.mixanitouxronou.gr/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/agnostos-stratiotis-1926.jpg ) , and also [ here ] ( http://www.mixanitouxronou.gr/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/-e1394379551542.jpg ) [ here is the unavailing of the monument in 1928 !, 
  ] ( http://www.mixanitouxronou.gr/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/charaktirisan-teras-to-mnimio-to.jpg ) it later became the setting of one of the strongest photographs of greek history . 
  [ this one ] ( https://parallhlografos.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/p11730261.jpg ) here , is one of the last days of the nazi occupation of greece in 1944 . 
  the men are nazi officials whose name history has forgotten . 
  behind them , stand a myriad of allied troops . 
  the nazi officers surrendered and expressed the will to formally honor the men of the resistance they fought wars for the past 3 years . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.grlawoffice.gr/attachments/image/greece_parliament.jpg?template=generic ) is what the monument looks like today . 
  it 's actually really [ big ] ( http://www.agrinioculture.gr/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/%ce%b2%ce%bf%cf%85%ce%bb%ce%ae-%cf%83%cf%8d%ce%bd%cf%84%ce%b1%ce%b3%ce%bc%ce%b1.jpg ) bonus [ picture ] ( https://www.efsyn.gr/sites/efsyn.gr/files/styles/teaser_big/public/wysiwyg/oland-stefani.jpg?itok=-obec-ve ) with holande, 
  [ orthodox stronk !, 
   euroleftists and eurosceptics rule greece . 
  the eu does n't like them so they must pro-kremlin radicals !, 
  greece is russian puppet state confirm you guize !, 
  trust me , i know greek politics !, 
   it 's not just national sentiments , it is a principle of not behaving like it is 19th century if we started sanctioning and stopped trading with everyone who act as if it 's the 19th century , we would n't have anyone to trade with . 
  it 's just the reality of things . 
  here in southeastern europe we do n't like turkey that much , either . 
  saying that they pose a security threat to the eastern balkans and to cyprus would be taking it lightly . 
  but we do n't loose sleep over it . 
  and we do n't block turkey from our club , because turkey being in that club is what makes turkey better , and therefore us safer . 
   but i ca n't imagine taking putin in good faith ... we did it for a decade !, 
  we take other bad leaders in good faith !, 
  middle eastern dictators , african dictators . 
  the leaders of turkey and azerbaijan !, 
  historically , we have taken everyone , even freaking soviet leaders in good faith !, 
  why suddenly putin ? 
  why suddenly now ? 
  i get that eastern europe has strong national sentiments against russia , but can we do business with them , at least ? 
  we do n't have to be allies , or have joint military exercises and that stuff ... 
  but can we at least sell them shit ? 
  pro russia sentiment is n't exclusive of the greek left . 
  it 's actually more prevalent on the greek right . 
  kamenos , the defense minister , is really the one orchestrating most of this , and his party is basically putin light , if that makes any sense . 
  we do n't like putin or his policies . 
  we just like russian tourists coming to greece and selling food and pharmaceuticals to the ruskies . 
  we also like getting cheap gas from a relavitely stable place rather than getting it from the middle east by invading it every 5 fucking minutes . 
  fuck us , right ? 
  honestly , tsipras really is n't behind this . 
  this kind of move is way too smart for him . 
  it 's greek defense strategists . 
  and they have good reasons to keep russia close . 
  what eastern europe does n't understand , ( probably because they were on the other side of the cold war ) , is that nato is a defensive alliance , not an offensive one . 
  the purpose of it is retaliation , not provocation . 
  one thing that set us apart is that we always took our rivals intentions in good faith . 
  had we placed rockets to the eastern border every time the soviet union did soviet stuff , the cold war would n't be so cold . 
  getting closer to russia , not becoming allies , but just taking them in good faith , it is sort of a good strategy . 
  the sanctions really have been proved ineffective anyway , and have only made puttin more radical within russia . 
  they lead to provocations and diplomatic gridlock from both sides . 
  most importantly , they have forced russia to shift its alliance to china in the east , which makes for a much more dangerous geopolitical scene in eurasia . 
  and we ca n't have that , especially in the long term . 
  that 'd be much more of a security concern than we have now . 
  and greece is n't unaffected by the sanctions !, 
  the fact that we have to issue less russian schengen visas hurts greek tourism , especially ecclesiastic tourism , and the fact that we ca n't export many of our products to russia due the embargo has hurt greek businesses . 
  i am sure germany can still sell cars and trains to russia just as they could before . 
  but us ? 
  our biggest industries are disproportionately affected by the sanctions , so there is good reason to oppose them . 
  i am not saying leave ukraine alone . 
  that 's certainly not what 's happening . 
  russia has clearly crossed the line by annexing crimea and we need a common european response to that . 
  i just think that response should make things better , not worse . 
  that 's only the second half of what it says . 
  the whole inscription reads :  i covered an empty bed with cloth for the sake of the dead that i can not see , remembering that the men whose merit shines need no burial , for all the earth will forever act as their grave . 
  i do n't know exactly how it works . 
  they probably ca n't take a shower either . 
  they probably have found other ways to clean themselves , but i would n't know ... 
  it is a genuine law though . 
   why are women banned from mount athos ? 
  bruh . 
  apparently it 's not obvious enough for non greeks , aint ugh ? 
  ok here is the tldr : a guy goes to the peninsula in the 7nth century and finds it lovely , so he built a monastery there . 
  soon others follow did the same . 
  then the ottomans take over . 
  the monks say : look , we 're just doing jesusy stuff here . 
  please just let us be . 
  ottomans grant autonomy . 
  greece then came along . 
  hey ! , said greece !, 
  hey ! , said mount athos !, 
  so i was wondering , since i conquered this land and i technically rule you now and whatnot , would you be so kind so as to sign my constitution ? , said greece . 
  not wanting to invade holy ground , the greek pm compromised . 
  they gave athos the following deal : they would become an autonomous and unincorporated territory of greece . 
  neither the constitution nor greek laws would apply on the peninsula , and they would have the protection of the greek military . 
  in return , they would accept the authority of the king of greece , later the greek president , and be transparent about their government processes and finances to the head of states office .
