  should athos fail to do so , the greek authorities can research the matter within athos . 
  athos , promptly agreed . 
  soon the first data came in !, 
  surprise , athos has been hoarding gold for thousands of years and is freaking [ rich af ] ( http://www.imma.edu.gr/macher/cache/image/athos/10449.800.jpg ) . 
  who could have guessed ? 
  except everybody . 
  then the european union came along . 
  what is going on here ? , said the eu we have a different citizenship , constitution and laws from the rest of greece , said athos . 
  f * ck said the eu . 
  what am i going to do with them , greece ? 
  do whatever said greece . 
  and that is why athos is the only `` oversees territory '' of the eu , even though it 's freaking attached to the european mainland . 
  athonians do n't vote in greek elections , and they are not greek nationals . 
  but they are legit european citizens , vote for european elections and can travel freely to all eu countries , but noone can go to athos without a visa issued by the athonian authorities . 
  but this does n't really answer the question . 
  why are n't women allowed in ? 
  because it 's their property and they do n't like women in male only monasteries , which happens to be exactly what their entire property is . 
  in the same way donald trump is n't allowed into my house because i do n't like him !, 
  that 's it !, 
  that 's all there is to it . 
  now time for some funny athonian laws . 
  in athos , all water is considered holy water , taking a bath is therefore forbidden . 
  you may not trim or shave your body hair . 
  you can only eat 2 times a day , and each meal should n't take longer than 10 minutes . 
  see ladies ? 
  now you do n't want to go there . 
  the end . 
   big part of islands are demilitatized [ who told you that ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hellenic_army#structure ) all but one of these treaties have expired , sovereignty fully transferred to the respective countries . 
  and the one treaty that has n't expired , the treaty of paris , is a treaty between greece and italy . 
  turkey did n't participate in any way , and italy today is totally fine with us having troops on the islands . 
  neither . 
  they would say macedonia . 
  hellas certainly exists as a concept at the time , but it 's nothing more than a cultural , historical and linguistic link . 
  it 's not a nationality . 
  much in the same way i consider myself a european , but i would n't reply to thst question : i am from europe . 
  happy birthday georgia !,

   suburb we ... do n't exactly have those here . 
  in athens , there is [ athens ( singular ) ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/athens,+greece/@37.981662,23.6971784,12.5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x14a1bd1f067043f1:0x2736354576668ddd!8m2!3d37.983917!4d23.7293599?hl=en ) which is the city of athens , capital of greece , home to the parliament , the old city of athens and a lot of government buildings . 
  it 's a single , very old municipality with a common mayor , home to less than a million people . 
  but there there is also [ athens ( plural ) ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:2010_dimi_athinas_numbered.svg#file ) , the metropolitan area of athens which is 35 municipalities home to no less than 3.5 million people . 
  all of these places are considered cities , collectively known as athens ( plural ) , and outside those cities it gets rural , really fast . 
  the same applies to other cities in greece , like thessaloniki , piraeus , patras and heraclion . 
  so ... are the cities surrounding athens considered suburbs ? 
  if so . 
  then [ this ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@37.9535611,23.7384667,3a,75y,202.89h,99.86t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sfd_hrc8kjp-cinzp1-gctg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1?hl=en ) is a suburb . 
  even though it 's more densely populated than athens itself . 
  maybe we should dismiss the southern municipalities as highly populated areas and say that the athenian suburbia is only at the north of athens , when there is a lot more space ... then [ this ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/athens,+greece/@38.0759949,23.8108584,3a,75y,265.06h,75.79t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s0yekfntkdpeujr8s-0fdvq!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo0.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3d0yekfntkdpeujr8s-0fdvq%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d6.7321649%26pitch%3d0!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x14a1bd1f067043f1:0x2736354576668ddd!8m2!3d37.983917!4d23.7293599!6m1!1e1?hl=en ) is a suburb . 
  even though it 's still a city of athens . 
  or maybe nothing inside the athenian metropolitan area is a suburb . 
  then something like [ this ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/athens,+greece/@37.8078124,23.8491057,3a,75y,336.18h,87.11t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1su1pdrpyh1rztthwcwavfuw!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo0.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3du1pdrpyh1rztthwcwavfuw%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d37.701427%26pitch%3d0!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x14a1bd1f067043f1:0x2736354576668ddd!8m2!3d37.983917!4d23.7293599!6m1!1e1?hl=en ) or this would be our suburbs . 
  but that 's not a suburb !, 
  that 's some houses next to the beach in between little towns . 
  there really is n't any agreement on what should be called suburbs . 
  it 's not just for athens , it 's for all of greece . 
  probably the closest thing that we have to suberbs is some towns between the airport and the metropolitan area that look like [ this ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@37.9091268,23.8784167,3a,75y,169.74h,83.12t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sej4_myeeqjrwrrkb6q_3oa!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1?hl=en ) but the word suburb in general as an american construct , does n't really apply in europe . 
   gambling is prohibited in turkey what ? 
  and we have n't tapped on that market yet by filling the islands with casinos and giving turks gambling visas ? 
  shame on us !, 
  i used to think that it was just a phase of the late 90s - early 2000s . 
  apparently it is n't . 
  i am so f * cking glad it is n't . 
  who fucking does n't !, 
  there are touristy places in the north ? 
  they might be from there ... 
  i would n't know ... 
  and i had to google that , honestly . 
  one family is from venice , the other is from a who cares village in the east coast . 
  i would n't remember how it 's called if i tired . 
  ok , fair points . 
  maybe it 's just me . 
  i am citizen , and a taxpayer . 
  and my judgment for varoufakis as a finance minister is negative , no going around it . 
  but i am not an economist or an academic on this field , so i do n't think that i should be the one to judge him on that regard . 
  that 's all i am saying , and it 's not unreasonable to expect others to do the same . 
  it 's to do with respect . 
  you should n't demean others , even if you disagree with them . 
  ugh ... did i say that ? 
  or implied it ? 
  i. . just do n't see it . 
   varoufakis , literally who ? 
  i am australian so i did n't know him until he was all over the news all of a sudden . 
  how am i supposed to know who he is ? 
  it 's not like he was a senior professor at the university of sidney for more than 10 years ... oh , except he [ was ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yanis_varoufakis ) ... 
   i do n't study macroeconomics or work on monetization , but let me decide who is distinguished in that field and who is n't . 
  varoufakis is a person i did n't know until last year . 
  i also happen to disagree with him . 
  therefore , i have concluded from my extensive 2 minutes assessment that he is not a good academic , lol nope . 
   syrzia were idiots for even thinking `` anti-austerity '' was an option . 
  i do n't disagree . 
  i actually did n't vote for syriza myself , and i found the very prospect and platform of syriza ludacris from the very beginning . 
  i am not defending the opinion of syrizas plan about fiscal policy . 
  i could n't , there is no such thing . 
  but varoufakis really is one of the worlds most distinguished academics . 
  he does pioneering work with macroeconomic models and monetization schemes , and his work is behind many established and highly profitable businesses in greece and elsewhere . 
  his assessment of the problems of greece and the eurozone is very valid , and pretty much universally accepted . 
  but if anything , his appointment from an independent mp as finance minister was syrizas greatest mistake . 
  he was , from day one , not going to accept any solution but his own . 
  and his solution : haircut in return of reforms , was political suicide for other governments ... and in the end , the prolonging of the negotiation was political suicide for syriza too .
