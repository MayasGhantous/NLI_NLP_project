  i 'll be perfectly honest , i am on your side . 
  i disagree with varoufakis in principle . 
  many other economists do as well . 
  but saying that he 's not a world famous and distinguished economist because you and i disagree with him is a bit of a stretch , do n't you think ? 
  varoufakis certainly is n't a clueless idiot . 
  he one of the worlds most distinguished academics in his field . 
  the fact that he did n't make a good finance minister is actually kind of scary , and quite revealing of the state of the european union today . 
  the job of politicians in the eu has been reduced from doing things , to finding consensuses about doing things . 
  varoufakis , certainly does n't fit in that role . 
  he would n't compromise on what he considers a wrong action driven by politics and he said so openly . 
  and that 's why he was removed . 
  2018 is the year that program concludes , that 's why it 's 2018 , probably not for any other reason . 
  it 's the question nature vs nurture . 
  the answer for me personally , is nurture . 
  and here is an example from my own life : i am at least half italian , and half greek by blood . 
  my last name is italian ( ends with ___ ano ) , i even have some little cousins from italy that visited me here in greece sometime ago . 
  what a bunch of pricks xd . 
  which brings me to this : i do n't feel remotely italian . 
  in fact , it feels kind of bad even saying that i am half italian ( no offence to italians ) . 
  i mean , gosh , i 'm 21 , and i 'll probably only visit italy this year for the first time , and that 's only because of a friend there . 
  that 's how indifferent i am . 
  i do n't speak the slightest italian ... 
  i do n't anything , italian !, 
  i feel greek , fully greek . 
  in fact , not just any greek . 
  that 's where home is for me . 
  my cousin on the other hand ... what a looser , he is from the ionian islands . 
  i am always like : lol kefalonia is literally the worst ionian island , all the rest actually have something going for them , you only have your stinky corpse of your patriot saint !, 
  he is like : lol , schoinousa , literally where ? 
  i tried to go there but the island is so small i could n't find it on the freaking map , lol . 
  and now the bomb is dropping when you realize : neither i , nor him , has ever actually lived there , ever . 
  we 're actually first cousins living in the same neighborhood of athens . 
  but we grew up in different households , so we might as well grown up in different continents . 
  identity is all about nurture . 
  i would with no hesitation call a black person greek if he was raised here and plays tavli while drinking frappe on the beach , and i would n't call an expat from australia whose entire ancestry is greek , greek , if he is not raised as such . 
  that 's how i feel about it . 
  i have never seen one , ever . 
  hello , is this me ? 
  dammit , i know the feel . 
  i have the same problem . 
  i am white as sin but i have very distinct dark hair and beard . 
  used to , anyway , i shave it now cause of my job ; _ ;, 
   an important distinction is that metaxists did not believe in racial purity . 
  they did , but to a much lesser extent , possibly held back by the orthodox church . 
   an actual metaxist group would have a much higher chance of winning the elections and would be far scarier . 
  that 's the point i am making . 
  people think hitler is the logical end of fascism , they have no idea . 
  for one , in greece , metaxas is to this day revered by a vast majority of greeks , considered a national hero , with roads and libraries in his name ... you would n't see a statue of hitler in germany today ... 
  but in greece ? 
  [ this guy ] ( http://www.onalert.gr/files/image/onalertphotos/history/wwarii/epos_40/31%20metaxas_10_10.jpg ) gets all the perks . 
  do you want a f * cking metaxist pm in greece in 10 years ? 
  because that 's how you get one ... 
  in all honesty there is a far right that is further right than fascism . 
  it 's called [ metaxism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metaxism ) . 
  it 's basically fascism + monarchy + radical orthodox christianity . 
  to get a sense of it , think of it like this : metaxists see hitler and mussolini as vaguely left wing and degenerates with a right wing facade . 
  and that 's all you need to know , honestly . 
  oh , and yes . 
  golden dawn , and that new cypriot party do consist a big extent by metaxists, 
   reunification with the north more like a `` unification with greece '' kind of party . 
  you bet i am . 
  i 've lived in pre-war housing for a long time , had to deal with awfully designed doors and windows . 
  no more is that the case !, 
  it 's the kind of thing that most people are apathetic about but damnit , it 's the little kind of things like this that i love . 
  sometimes you ought to be patriotic . 
  when i see the signature mechanism of alumil in places like barcelona or stockholm , or when i see vexillologists use the greek flag as an example of a good flag , or when i see an image of the rion antirion bridge , that 's the kind of thing that fills me with patriotism . 
  it 's an appropriate response . 
  yes , but ... ugh ... 
  honestly i do n't get it either ... watch [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehy6g52plie ) with subs on . 
  you know what the best part is ? 
  much of them windows are made ... 
  in greece !, 
  i am not kidding , [ alumil ] ( http://www.alumil.com/ ) a company that has many of the patents involved in this , coupled with a huge share of this market and one which manufactures those mechanisms for other european companies as well , is based in greece ( you can find it as almy in the stock exchange ) , and [ its factories are here too !, 
  ] ( http://www.alumil.com/files/1/company/%ce%99%cf%83%cf%84%ce%bf%cf%81%ce%b9%ce%b1/alumilfactory.jpg ) bet you did n't expect that , did you ? 
   jaysus , you 're fucked . 
  i know, 
   the analogy to the haushold doesnt work here because many unemployed are not supported by state . 
  that means that they support themselves through their savings , or that someone else is supporting them . 
  it 's still household income . 
  cyprus is n't foreign to us . 
  it 's like our 14th province . 
  you know what the best thing is ? 
  that government was then reelected . 
  nuff said . 
  we deserve it all !, 
   but often everynody in a houshold is unemployed and they do n't get state support . 
  you did n't quite get it . 
  think of it as household a being greece and b being poland . 
  it is in that regard that greece is richer , not to mention assets . 
   getting reed of this debt would also drasticly lower greek wealth also , that 's not exactly how it works . 
  most assets are in the form of housing in greece . 
  if i sell you my house , that makes the government super happy . 
  i get the money , and you get assets in greece . 
  you just brought some money here !, 
  it 's as if ... money magically appeared into the greek economy !, 
  never mind you starting renting or using those assets to get some of your money back . 
  then our government will be taxing your income as well . 
  it 's a win win !, 
  \u03a4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u03ad\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd : having assets is what creates more assets , which creates assets , which create more assets !, 
   why do you exclude unemployed when talking about average richness of greeks .
