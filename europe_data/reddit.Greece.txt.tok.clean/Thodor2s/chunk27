  sure , but [ i love china the most ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/name_of_greece ) . 
  theirs has come to mean '' \u03a4he land of the great hopeful '' , and they use the correct root of the world as well !, 
  [ bravo china !, 
  it wo n't necessarily replace demand . 
  we 'll just be able to get natural gas from more places like azerbaijan and iran , now that we can again . 
  this diversification will make us more able to negotiate better prices and terms with the russians in the short term , and in the long term this pipeline will carry gas from the gas fields off the coasts of greece and cyprus , possibly eliminating the need of energy imports into the single market altogether , that 's if renuables take over at a reasonable rate . 
  happy birthday norway !, 
  [ you da best !, 
   although i have no idea how the greek islands are powered , do they have local generation or is it undersea power cables to the mainland grid ? 
  honestly i am not really sure . 
  i am only certain that the power grid reaches every inhabited island . 
  electricity is therefore mostly provided by the mainland , at when it comes to the aegean islands . 
  that sounds wasteful though . 
  distances are vast and theres surely some energy lost in transport . 
  so there is opportunity to improve . 
  sadly the strict zoning laws of the islands make it almost impossible to build windfarms there . 
   actually , it 's hugely impressive for a country that is functionally bankrupt . 
  it 's probably because we 're bankrupt though . 
  few industries here have better return than energy anymore , so comparatively , there is a boom in energy in general , [ which is why you see billions of euros of investment in this area in greece , even to this day ] ( http://www.novinite.com/articles/174500/construction+of+tap+gas+pipeline+to+start+tuesday ) . 
  but i think the government treated it horribly at first . 
  [ we filled greece with solar panels ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/worldwide_photovoltaic_deployment_in_watts_per_capita_by_country.svg/2000px-worldwide_photovoltaic_deployment_in_watts_per_capita_by_country.svg.png ) thinking that it 's the kind of renewable energy that fits us best . 
  turns out , it is n't . 
  you see ... [ greece is very mountainous ] ( http://www.greeceathensaegeaninfo.com/a-greece-travel/a-maps/maptopogreece.jpg ) , there really is n't a lot of flat land for solar power installments to go through , [ and we do n't get as much sun as you would think ] ( http://solargis.info/doc/_pics/freemaps/1000px/dni/solargis-solar-map-dni-europe-en.png ) , so it was pretty terrible planning overall . 
  thankfully though , there are ways for countries with mountains and rivers to get renewable energy : hydroelectricity . 
  turns out , simply using some of the subsidies to put generators on our existing dams resulted in doubling hydroelectric power between 2012 and 2013 , and ever since it has been the primary focus . 
  as you can see [ here , in the 3rd map . 
  the blue ones are hydroelectric plants in operation , and the green ones are under construction ] ( http://renewablegreece.wikispaces.com/%ce%9f%ce%b9+%ce%91%ce%a0%ce%95+%cf%83%cf%84%ce%b7%ce%bd+%ce%95%ce%bb%ce%bb%ce%ac%ce%b4%ce%b1+%cf%83%ce%ae%ce%bc%ce%b5%cf%81%ce%b1 ) . 
  but i still feel it 's too little , too late . 
  it 's also to do with the fact that we use more energy than we should per capita , but the potential is just too much , and our response depressingly little . 
   and later this month i 'll be starting modern greek good luck to ya , honestly . 
  it 's the kind of language that is ubiquitous in fields like archaeology , classics and literature , but one that people , even , people who want to live in greece , do n't really feel compelled to learn , since most people here can communicate perfectly fine in english and other languages . 
  this is where you should start . 
  http://www.greek-language.gr/ the center for the greek language is an academic body officially tasked by the greek government to run and license greek language schools around the world , runs language proficiency exams and hands out the degrees for the greek language among other things . 
  i know all that because they were on ert today , talking about how they have created support structures for students of greek from all around the world , rather than just running the examinations . 
  they seemed like a cool bunch , check them out !, 
  wow . 
  that 's good to hear . 
  i wish we had done the same , but we 're a lot behind in that regard . 
  [ sometime this year we 'll hit 30 % of our electricity generation coming from renewable sources ] ( http://imgur.com/actyoyt ) . 
  but that 's not really impressive , i guess . 
  actually the internet wo n't be taxed after all , because of public outcry , and because it was shown to be counterproductive in other countries . 
  it turns out , unsurprisingly , governments actually loose money overall by taxing internet use . 
  something like :  muh european federalism , muh europe will become one country run by dictatorship with one army , one currency , our nations will be dissolved and germany will run everything like they always wanted . 
  the eu is evil and anti-democratic . 
  it 's the new communism , only worse ... etc. 
  `` hellenized '' is a big miss for me . 
  i do n't understand who got hellenized and who did n't . 
  certainly the tribes of the greek mainland and southern balkans got hellenized in antiquity over time under mycenaean rule and later periods , certainly sicily was hellenized , certainly much of the eastern roman empire got hardcore hellenized when christianity became a hit . 
  but apart from that , who else got hellenized ? 
  were the hellenistic kingdoms in the middle east really hellenized because their leaders were macedonian nobility and spoke greek ? 
  were the latest egyptian kingdoms hellenized because their leaders even went as far to mix greek religion into their egyptian stuff ? 
  was the roman empire hellenized because everyone was obsessed with greece ? 
  did the russians become hellenized when they adopted greek religion , customs and honorary titles in the middle ages ? 
  did the whole of europe become hellenized when we all suddenly had a collective obsession with greek stuff in the renaissance ? 
  where does one draw the line ? 
  probably not . 
  but i totally see a european income tax in the future . 
  exactly . 
  the ecb is futureproofing the currency to eastwards expansion !, 
  probably the bulgarians will have something similar to our thing in their coins too . 
  in all honestly though , it 's probably because the greek mint wanted to somehow include the naming of the currency and its denominations in the greek script as opposed to just latin . 
  which is pretty understandable . 
  in fact the greek government wanted to put the greek script in the front of all paper money and coinage , but the name did n't make it to coinage because of the restricted space ...  inb4 so why does n't cyprus do the same ? 
  because cypriots do use the latin script officially , and the naming euro and cent like everyone else , as opposed to greeks who use the naming evro , and lepto respectively . 
   inb4 so ... 
  if greece is the only country that uses a different script than latin , why are the new euro banknotes have cyrillic on them ? 
  because [ soon ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/central-europe/news/bulgaria-says-it-will-start-talks-to-join-the-euro/ ) greece wo n't be the only one . 
  the difference is that 1k euros are moderate to decent living in poland but are close to poverty in greece , because everything is expensive af here . 
  dude what 's happening in greece is great depression tier . 
  the thing about this is that even people who do think that it 's in bad taste watch it . 
  the bad taste is part of the appeal . 
  it 's one of the 1st ones actually going all the way back to 2002 . 
  it 's just kind of rare , greece is a small country after all . 
  maybe it 's less so in southern europe . 
   implying that we care about the rules of the eurozone that 's adorable . 
   portugal never won euro do n't remind them about [ that ] ( http://images32.inewsgr.com/1456/14567998/1.jpg ) !, 
  you 're being mean ... 
   what do europeans really think of the eurovision song contest honestly it 's the kind of thing we religiously watch , both those who unironically like it and those who '' `` hate '' '' it . 
  it 's just ... such a spectacle , such an opportunity to gather with friends and genuinely have some fun ... 
  it 's so hard to pass on it . 
  and people who do pass on it ... do n't really exist . 
  they just pretend to be better than this ... aaaaand watch it anyway , alone and miserable .
