  which is why i 'll say this to everyone : come out . 
  [ it 's ok to watch eurovision ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bhyfyibt5o&amp;t=0m45s ) . 
  nobody will shame you for making fun or things , nobody takes it seriously anyway !, 
  you are supposed to laugh and close your ears to the terrible stuff and spew nonsense and be patriotic and play drinking games !, 
  why deny yourself eurovision week ? 
  are you this into not having fun ? 
   dat voting system  dem finalsts  dat message  dat victory jesus christ eurovision . 
  which is why i will vote for the opposite . 
  i 've learned my lesson . 
  sovereignty . 
  when given the option to have options , choose the option that gives you options . 
  greek 2 euro coin has [ actual freaking europe ] ( http://www.fleur-de-coin.com/images/currency/km200/km188_2002a.jpg ) on it / argument over, 
  seeing how r/europe changed the greek flag on the map from the strips to a much more readable cross , let 's talk about crosses . 
  i 'll start with the weirdest . 
  see there is a greek territory called [ mount ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/mont_athos_3d_version_1.gif ) [ athos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mount_athos ) . 
  it 's unincorporated , run by monks from all over the orthodox christian world as a monastic theocracy . 
  this place gets its power from time immemorial and has thousands of years of governing itself , you would think that at the peak of this mountain there would be a monument of a cross , right ? 
  well yes . 
  but it looks like [ this ] ( http://www.orthphoto.net/photo.php?id=34038 ) . 
  a place that build [ this ] ( http://www.macedonian-heritage.gr/athos/images/moni%20stavronikita/9673.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://www.macedonian-heritage.gr/athos/images/moni%20simonos%20petras/0017.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://nowiknow.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/st-pauls-cc-phool-4-xc.jpeg ) and [ this ] ( http://hetravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/800x545-mm-greece-mt-athos-simonas-petras.jpg ) in the middle ages with no outside help ... is topped by [ this ] ( http://www.monastiriaka.gr/img/6239281c21d41e030a4969d4ece3df33stayros.jpg ) how ? 
  why ? 
  https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/feb/11/10 plus that kind of tunnel is cheaper to make . 
   will your government burden its people with higher interest debt or will it have to stick with ez-financed low-interest debt at the cost of souvereignty ? 
  mr tsipras , do you hear that ? 
  i want a referendum on that , please !, 
  interest rates are kind of the whole point . 
   having less debt makes the debt more serviceable , lowering interest rates . 
   having less debt by defaulting on , or restructuring your debt signifies to your lenders that you may do it again in the future , making you less credible and raising interest rates . 
  so our government needs to somehow make the debt be less on paper , without defaulting on any of it . 
  it 's sort of a herculean task . 
  but i am sure both sides see the benefits in pulling something like this . 
  looks pretty good to me tbh . 
   one of the things that amazes me about this sub is so many people from so many different countries that can speak english so well despite it not being a native language . 
  well i think it 's mostly to do with the fact that in general , people on reddit are more likely to be tech savvy ( and therefore be more familiar with english ) , and that people on this sub are more likely to have lived - traveled - worked or visited a lot of other countries , so they might be familiar with many languages , one of them probably being english . 
  i think it 's this , more than anything else . 
   especially from eastern europe , since the alphabet 's completely different in some places . 
  rip any chance of european movie and series creators having any actual continental and international audience . 
  all those channels and business people that lobbied for this ... you are actually shooting yourself in the foot . 
  watch as the american entertainment industry swipes you out of the market with bigger productions with witch you could n't ever compete because your initial audience was minuscule compared to theirs . 
  yeah , that was kind of rude , i guess . 
  : / sorry for that . 
  sorry about this . 
  i am new here ... 
  snooooooooooooooooooooore watch this instead : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5grl_mw9nk, 
  do we need the same outdated news story every day in r/europe ? 
   the greek bailout sucks  greeks are n't happy about it  the government has betrayed its supporters etc. 
  yeah , it 's a big deal , and you bet i and everyone i know will whine about it , especially when tax season 2017 comes with 60 % income tax , jesus !, 
  but the government feels confident in its majority passing the measures for a reason . 
  because the vast majority of greeks still believe the bailouts are the least horrible option . 
  that 's the nature of the least horrible option . 
  you whine about it , and do it anyway . 
  what did you expect ? 
  it would be more of a surprise if we did tbh . 
  that 's why it 's bad , it 's not even fun . 
  that 's probably because basket in greece is huge , especially lately , and the greek basket union felt confident that they can fill stadiums . 
  the song was so bad we do n't even deserve the ironic vote or the troll vote tbh, 
   ebu music plays god , i love being european !, 
  i just do n't understand . 
  why are we giving anything to turkey in the first place ? 
  if one is not a genuine refugee , he should be returned to turkey , same as happens literally everywhere on the planet ( little known fact , we had a repatriation deal with turkey before this deal , they never accepted anyone ) . 
  why do we accept this , and why do we have to pledge things to them that we know are politically impossible in europe at the moment for them to do the obvious ? 
  i just do n't understand ... edit : no , actually this is true , turkey and greece had a deal regarding illegal immigrants , not necessarily turks . 
  it was because at the time ( and arguably still ) turkey did n't patrol its borders adequately , which leads to a lot of illegal immigration from the middle east through turkey . 
  turkey has consistently refused to accept migrants back . 
  oh , believe me , greece would find 4.5 billion if we had to . 
  ( surely that debt is n't getting any smaller , so f * ck it , we might as well own it xd ), 
  this is actually a very valid point . 
  i never thought of it that way ... maybe we should ask the inhabitants of the greek provinces that used to make the athenian empire if they want tribute in compensation from attica 2500 years later for the creation of the acropolis . 
  oh wait , i know what we should do !, 
  when the marbles are reunified and displayed in the acropolis museum , we should pledge all the earnings from the exhibition to those provinces !, 
  that 's it !, 
   politically and fiscally greece is dead and will remain like that how about no ? 
  greece is a peaceful , mineral rich country with a favorable climate , an educated population , and robust democratic institutions that have survived literal madness over the past decade . 
  literally all the prerequisites for wealth creation have been here from the very beginning . 
  saying that the greek economy will take leaps in the next decade is n't optimism , it 's a matter of fact . 
  all the data points to this . 
   the `` text of the holy scripture shall be maintained unaltered . 
  official translation of the text into any other form of language , without prior sanction by the autocephalous church of greece and the great church of christ in constantinople , is prohibited . 
  '' ; thus partially subduing freedom of speech to the will of the church . 
  this is a fair point . 
  but it 's better understood as a question of the churches `` right '' to preach what it considers to be the true word and doctrine of the christian faith . 
  see the tradition of civil law , actually dates is the mostly greek byzantine empire , and it based in the 1000 years old tradition of `` ceasaropapism '' ( ceasar over pope - secular authority over religious authority ) . 
  this goes beyond secularism in may aspects . 
  not only is the state all powerful in the matters of state , but the state actually has power in matters of religion as well . 
  which ... of course can be very problematic . 
  especially for a religion of the book . 
  can you guess why ? 
  so of course the power of the state over the church had some limits . 
  namely : the state ca n't alter the bible . 
  again , super important in the ottoman treaty . 
  you would n't want the ottoman authorities writing and later printing their own version of the bible !? 
  and in the same way the greek authorities promise to never print an altered bible , nor allow anyone else to do so . 
  it 's like the church has trademarked the bible , and allows its use as long as it 's not altered . 
  that 's all . 
  i do n't see it as the church subduing freedom of speech . 
  much in the same way that if you rewrote the da vinci code and published it under the same name , but with slight alterations in the plot , it would n't have been considered freedom of speech , but most likely a copyright infringement . 
   furthermore : ( article 16 ) 2 . 
  education constitutes a basic mission for the state and shall aim at the moral , intellectual , professional and physical training of greeks , the development of national and religious consciousness and at their formation as free and responsible citizens . 
  this is pretty old . 
  and most likely it 's getting scrapped in the next constitutional review .
