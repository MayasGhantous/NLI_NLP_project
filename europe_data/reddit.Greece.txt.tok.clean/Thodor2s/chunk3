  point still stands . 
  it 's not really comparable . 
  maybe erdogan should start assuming ...  very critical roles on issues of vital importance such as the maintenance of global peace and security , mediation , development , humanitarian aid , environment , the alliance of civilizations and the like by ... recognizing cyprus , a un member , signing and ratifying the law of the sea , one of the pillars of international law , not dumping raw sewage into the aegean , not disputing international treaties like the treaty of lausanne ... and while we 're at it , you may also want to pass an actual charter of human rights in turkey , some actual freedom of the press laws , end the conflict with the kurds by giving them some autonomy , recognize yo genocides , enforce your middle eastern borders , and stop violating european airspace and claiming international trade routes . 
  you know ... for a start ... 
   does the un need another hq the un most certainly needs a different hq . 
  the reason being that america sings next to no international treaties and ratifies even fewer . 
  un in american soil is sort of a dangerous deal too . 
  because if some countries boycott america ( and this has happened in the past ) the un can then act without them , which delegitimatizes it as the source and force of international law . 
   does the country represent the united nations charter ? 
  exactly , the point is to , when it 's time to move ( and it has to happen at some point ) , for the un to move to a country that does represent its charter . 
  preferably none of the 5 security council countries and in any case a country that promises to ratify the pillars of international law and make them part of their own constitution ( as happens in many countries already btw ) , so turkey is out , for pretty much all the reasons . 
   is it in an area/a continent of the world that does n't yet have a un hq ? 
  and holy shit would that make for a great hq !, 
  the eastern roman empire is not even comparable . 
  it had a legitimate government and claim to territory for more than a thousand years . 
  that makes it the longest lived empire in the history of the world , and the second longest lived country in history after japan , and that 's not even counting ancient rome , which the byzantines were a continuation of . 
  i would have guessed celsius . 
   critising of lausanne by islamists . 
  oh , thank god , it 's just the islamists . 
  everyone calm down you guys , it 's just the islamists . 
  take a look [ here ] ( http://pantheon.media.mit.edu/rankings/people/gr/all/-4000/2010/h15 ) it 's not that there are n't important people from modern greece , it 's just that our list is completely flooded by the ancients , gods bless them . 
  holy shit in the top 10 , we have like ... 6 ... 
  archimedes was born in sicily . 
  he is listed in italy , ranked 3rd beneath leonardo da vinci and julius caesar . 
  never . 
  unless you can travel back in time in the 1920s and somehow enforce the treaty of serves that would see constantinople be an independent city state under european influence . 
  here in greece one solution is the outdoors , but usually there is no problem of doing it in your parents house , sometimes they wont be there , others you just wont scream like a retard . 
  parents here had to do it in worse circumstances when they were young , so they 'll understand . 
  do n't forget [ us ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ladara/ ) ... 
  opens article , ctrl-f convention : no results . 
  utter garbage reporting at its prime !, 
  good job once again , reuters !, 
  the tldr is this : syriza just had a national convention , in which many people came forward with different ministerial plans , so a reshuffle is on the way . 
  it was basically planned . 
  we knew it was coming for about a year , it was n't a response to polls , or policy , or the debt as the title implies . 
  which is n't to say that these are n't real issues . 
  it 's also a matter of policy , not just economics . 
  car ownership is aggressively discouraged in greece for a decade now in urban areas so it 's not really a good measurement . 
  exactly , but salaries are not . 
  hence the poverty . 
  this is reasonable though . 
  665 euros of income per month is poverty in greece . 
  there is no way around it . 
  things are more expensive here than they are in lithuania . 
  where did you find that ? 
  put it back in the museum where it belongs . 
  blue med best med !, 
   a referendum is illegal because they are in greek soil from a purely legal standpoint , it 's not impossible . 
  after 2011 , [ peripheries ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/kallikratis_dioikisi.png ) can hold referendums . 
  that is the periphery of eastern macedonia and western thrace through , not just thrace . 
  having said that , a referendum of secession would be unprecedented . 
  probably it would go to the supreme court , who will have to decide if the results will be legally binding for the national government . 
  but before any of this happens , it would need the support of the peripheral assembly , the governor , and this is wildly fantastical since the population of christians vastly outnumbers that of muslims , and there is n't even a [ secessionist or party or movement ] ( https://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/%ce%a0%ce%b5%cf%81%ce%b9%cf%86%ce%ad%cf%81%ce%b5%ce%b9%ce%b1_%ce%91%ce%bd%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%bf%ce%bb%ce%b9%ce%ba%ce%ae%cf%82_%ce%9c%ce%b1%ce%ba%ce%b5%ce%b4%ce%bf%ce%bd%ce%af%ce%b1%cf%82_%ce%ba%ce%b1%ce%b9_%ce%98%cf%81%ce%ac%ce%ba%ce%b7%cf%82#.ce.a0.ce.b5.cf.81.ce.b9.cf.86.ce.b5.cf.81.ce.b5.ce.b9.ce.b1.ce.ba.ce.ad.cf.82_.ce.95.ce.ba.ce.bb.ce.bf.ce.b3.ce.ad.cf.82_2014 ) in the assembly . 
  so yeah . 
  possible ? 
  maybe . 
  likely ? 
  not at all . 
  in all honesty you make a very valid point . 
  i was n't aware that there were differences in the legal framework between european countries . 
  that is really fucked up . 
   we are not . 
  a disturbing amount of people support such laws . 
  [ but thankfully we are . 
  ] ( http://www.iefimerida.gr/news/279521/den-tha-theoreitai-pleon-poiniko-adikima-i-vlasfimia ), 
  i do n't get it . 
  it 's blasphemy laws , what does it have to do with the church ? 
  germany has them , denmark has them , italy has them , canada , new zealand , poland , all secular countries , that have blasphemy laws . 
  it has nothing to do with the church and state question . 
  especially since , yes , we 're getting rid of this law . 
  because everyone agrees it 's dumb . 
  and the church ca n't do nothing about it . 
  you think it 's bad that this law existed at all . 
  well too bad , all countries once had it . 
  the good thing about our system is that we can change it all we want and in any way we please , and you should appreciate that . 
  first of all , yes i really am an atheist . 
  i do n't deny the wrongdoings of the church , in fact i think they 're deplorable , even today . 
  and yes , i am a secularist in principle , but in practice , it 's a different story . 
  all of your examples are bs , btw . 
  these were prosecutions for the breaking of laws passed by parliament , not witch trials . 
  yes , i do think that the law that makes it illegal to make fun of religion is bullish , and most seem to agree which is why we are getting rid of that law . 
  but believe it or not the church still has nothing to do with that law . 
  that law was n't decided by church leaders in a secret meeting at the basement of the cathedral , it was voted in parliament by a conservative government in the 1800s or whatever . 
  same for all the laws . 
  the church has absolutely no power under our system , it 's just that at some point the general feeling was pro-church and now it is n't . 
  it 's not even influence . 
  also about this :  we do n't live in byzantine times anymore . 
  and this is where your thinking as an atheist does n't help you understand ( i had a hard time with it at first , too ) . 
  sure , you and i do n't live in the middle ages , but you know who does ? 
  religious people . 
  i do n't know if you 've noticed , but the people we 're dealing with ( the orthodox church ) really are the worst purists of the christian world . 
  it is a great privilege that our country is set in a way that we have some oversight over them , and if you think this is bad , see how the same church operates in bulgaria and russia where that dependency does n't exist . 
  that 's what you should fear . 
  ah , but if they become the ottoman empire , the treaty of lausanne ends and the treaty of sevres is back in effect , right ? 
  here is something coming from an atheist : we 'll be dammed if kids do n't study the new testament in school . 
  yes , it is a fairy tale , but it is one of the most important , resonating and fundamental texts of the greek language there is , one that defined greek culture for thousands of years . 
  what 's next ? 
  the homeric epics were pretty much the bible of pagans . 
  should we ban them from education too ? 
  how about historiography and philosophy and ancient drama ?
