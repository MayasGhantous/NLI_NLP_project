  the eu has the powers to restrict a member states actions in many ways . 
  countries can be fined and forced to comply to eu court rulings by the commission . 
  the council can take away their voting rights . 
  the parliament can vote a new budget that takes all eu funds away from the country , even retroactively , they can essentially exempt them from the single market , meaning the country wo n't be able to trade with the rest of the union . 
  given all these and more , it would be impossible for a dictatorship to effectively function under these circumstances , especially since the international community is likely to site with the european union . 
  and although it would be technically possible that the government would still stay into the european union , given the amount of pressure the eu can have on its member states , such scenario would be almost unthinkable . 
  to be fair cameron did . 
  he said : `` this is going to be a disaster , i wo n't go in history running this shit . 
  fuck it , i am out . '', 
  speak for yourself . 
  nigel would make a great grandpa playing the video lottery everyday with other grandpas at some remote greek island . 
  he 'd fit right in with their daily philosophical exercises , racism and drinking problems . 
  i do n't know the companies in spain and portugal but holy shit their logos are incredible . 
  our islands are also indisputably greek btw . 
  inb4 ataturk 's birthplace . 
  nato is basically a common military command for many countries . 
  it 's not like if the eu wants to also make one , it cant do under the umbrella of nato , but ultimately that would be worthless , and contrary to what nato wants . 
  the americans would prefer that european countries pay more to keep up with the command 's guidelines , but in every single debate about the eu army , advocates emphasize that combining our defense industries would yield better striking capability at a lower cost . 
  now , if this is the case , why would n't nato want one super strong army rather than the combination of many weaker armies into its ranks ? 
  it could , but it has to fundamentally change to accommodate for the new reality that a joint european military would provide , that reality being that europe would be more involved , by paying less and by focusing in the periphery . 
  nato is n't likely to change to accommodate that , and so the debate is really back here . 
  do we pursue our strategic and cost saving goals by creating the worlds second biggest military by risking being left outside of the nato umbrella ? 
  or do we double down inside nato which forces countries surrounded by allies in the middle of the continent to pay 2 % of their gdp on defense when they have basically no threats ? 
  in any case it 's not like there will be a eu us war or anything . 
  unfortunately it looks like we may find ourselves making such a decision at some point . 
  also , trump said he likes us for keeping our commitments to nato , which i am not sure how to take . 
  does he honestly think that given the choice between nato and eu military we will chose nato ? 
  eu regulation is n't an opt in opt out thing . 
  businesses who trade with europe , even those in latin america or asia , they have to follow them , even though it 's not the law in their country . 
  the biggest market de facto makes the rules for everyone . 
  unless britain finds an alien civilization to trade with , for companies that have a global reach , eu regulation is the law regardless of brexit . 
  32 seem many , i guess you 're right . 
  actually if you 're a true bilingual , you 'll find your train of thought switching languages randomly in some instances , circling around the languages you are fluent in pretty regularly . 
  or ... that 's just me , i do n't know . 
  nope , more like : katharevousa and demotic reflect the fact that greek , unlike most languages , had two different distinct lines of continuity . 
  the first one was from intellectuals and academics who recited ancient and religious texts , in the roman and byzantine empires and later in renascence europe and greece . 
  the second one , was the living , breathing language spoken by the common folk in greece for millennia . 
  it 's not like katharevousa was a master plan to `` make greek great again '' , it was just a literary language , used in writing by nerds who liked themselves their bible in koine , and later ancient greek stuff in koine too . 
  think of it as a register of greek more than anything . 
  plus , human to human interaction often ends with bribery , and not actual fines or consequences for those who break the law . 
  malmo should probably be included in copenhagen . 
  is n't norway in the eea ? 
  does n't the eu mandate standards for roads and funds them to an extent ? 
  are n't there european highways in norway ? 
  this year is the year tax evasion dies !, 
  i 've made a creed that i will never pay unless i do so by card , and i inform venders accordingly . 
  since i know for a fact now that as soon as my purchase is registered taxes are paid automatically , i take anything less than that as stealing . 
  if you guys come for vacation in greece , do the same . 
  i was talking with a friend yesterday and we decided that this honestly should n't even be celebrated . 
  it 's like celebrating waking up or taking your dog for a walk . 
  it 's just the nature of things . 
  til, 
  terrible wording on the title . 
  now ... where have i heard that before ? 
  you fool , do n't you get it ? 
  the golden lords have ordered yellow legos !, 
  bailouts are dealt exclusively by eurozone members . 
  the uk does n't contribute to bailouts . 
   march 25 1821 : greek declaration of independence from the ottomans . 
  ftfy . 
  independence did n't happen in a day . 
  it took until the 1840s to get a constitution and a democratic government going . 
  ca n't we have a middle ground with you people ? 
  some basic cohesion without the government feeling like it 's from 1984 . 
   headache the next day which is why we drink wine every day . 
  you ca n't be hangover when you 're always drunk/s no , but seriously though , i 've never experienced something like that . 
  this is already the law here , and i think in austria too . 
  seems like few regions but to be fair the vast majority of the greek wines i 've had were really really good . 
  especially the one from santorini , and the reds from the peloponnese . 
  holy shit !, 
   the guy could not legally own guns maybe he thought that was oppressing, 
  the shipping , tourism and services industries based in athens and piraeus somewhat made for an economic center before the crash . 
  but it does n't make up for the lack of nearby economic centers . 
  for one , if it goes bust ( which it did ) it takes everything away with it . 
  there is n't anything else in close proximity to keep businesses running . 
  the irony in greece is that from which ever way you look at it , the north should be way more developed . 
  it has more arable land , better infrastructure and is in closest proximity both to italy in the west and to istanbul in the east . 
  in fact the balkans in general are sort of ideal for the creation of economic centers . 
  population is n't high , but the mountainous terrain makes for concentrated population centers and there are also natural roads and valleys in between mountains pretty much linking all major population centers with the nearby ones . 
  i will never understand why the balkans are comparatively so underdeveloped . 
  maybe when all the guys north of us join the single market we can see some of that action . 
  if i learned anything from playing so much civ , is that usually the game is cruelly decided at the loading screen , when the map is being created . 
  if you 're geographically isolated from major centers of economy and knowledge , you 'd better have the resources in your proximity to create your own . 
  otherwise you 're out of luck . 
  [ see this map ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-10gkdslvehu/thiyqqe4l3i/aaaaaaaaac4/nmtswgtdddg/s1600/gdp+per+capita+by+region+2006%252c+eurozone.png ), 
   thus : kurdish is indeed related to european languages . 
  turkish is not . 
  fact . 
  neither is basque , finish , sami , hungarian and many more . 
  that does n't make these people less european . 
  i remember seeing statistics for greece that said it was pagans about up to 2009 and unaffiliated afterwards . 
  where are you getting your data kind sir ?

  word has 2 meanings :  `` identity '' is a * word * found under i in the dictionary \u03bb\u03ad\u03be\u03b7  i am going to keep my * word * . 
  \u039f\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ( pronounced inos ) is also a greek alternative , possibly related to the indo-european one . 
  what an awesome county we would be if the mentally ill fuckwits that threw our country in the trash for their own personal benefit got the same disapproval as transgenders when it comes to holding political office .
