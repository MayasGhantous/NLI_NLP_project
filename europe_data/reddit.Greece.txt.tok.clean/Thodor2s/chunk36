  heck you want an example of that happening ? 
  often when people suddenly remember that greece has a lot of debt , we see bs reports from both german and greek newspapers all the time . 
  stuff like : `` shocking : the secret plan to forgive all of greece 's debt with your social security money '' or `` breaking : greek negotiators accepted huge bribes ! '' . 
  i do n't remember a single time where the news lady has n't followed the reporting of these with : `` the spokesman of the pm or chancellor have distanced themselves from these sources emphasizing the actual wording of european treaties and the strategy that they are pursuing '' . 
  all of this just to make sure that absolutely noone domestically or otherwise interprets these unfounded articles in crappy newspapers as `` leaked information '' or `` the governments position '' . 
   parties like golden dawn literally claimed istanbul first of all , source it . 
  i honestly think even they are n't dumb enough to say that , and they really dumb . 
  secondly i think you coming from turkey do n't understand what condemnation is . 
  allow me to explain . 
  opinions are n't illegal in greece , so people can here can say whatever they please print their newspapers and hold rallies . 
  that does n't mean that the government is sympathetic to them or does n't condemn them . 
  and that 's in no way a reason to have them in . 
  think of it like this : if shit ever gets real , i will be drafted , and possibly many people in this sub too , possibly you too . 
  if it is necessary to preserve our way of life in europe or north america , i personally would have no objections to that . 
  can the same really be said for turkey ? 
  i would argue no . 
  which is why they should go . 
  btw how can this moronic reporting survive in an age when people can do [ this ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?q=southern+aegean ) and in seconds be clicking on an [ actual map ] ( https://www.google.gr/maps/place/%ce%9d%cf%8c%cf%84%ce%b9%ce%bf+%ce%91%ce%b9%ce%b3%ce%b1%ce%af%ce%bf/@36.8784508,26.9803137,10.11z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x14bdf20db7ea7a2d:0x100bd2ce2b980b0!8m2!3d37.0855302!4d25.1489215 ) of a province with borders and everything ? 
  are n't the people who fabricate this shit even a little bit ashamed for passing an inhabited de-jure greek island as an uninhabited grey zone ? 
  you can even f * cking [ street view ] ( https://www.google.gr/maps/place/%ce%9d%cf%8c%cf%84%ce%b9%ce%bf+%ce%91%ce%b9%ce%b3%ce%b1%ce%af%ce%bf/@36.9314071,27.1337092,3a,75y,332.18h,83.63t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-ift6ea_vrnk%2fvzcwebmtxbi%2faaaaaaaajwc%2frrl_3vuususg8ocbixhozyy215wpcn36wcjkc!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh4.googleusercontent.com%2f-ift6ea_vrnk%2fvzcwebmtxbi%2faaaaaaaajwc%2frrl_3vuususg8ocbixhozyy215wpcn36wcjkc%2fw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya314.5-ro0-fo100%2f!7i10240!8i5120!4m5!3m4!1s0x14bdf20db7ea7a2d:0x100bd2ce2b980b0!8m2!3d37.0855302!4d25.1489215!6m1!1e1 ) to the damn place !, 
   which did n't say anything about it why not ? 
  no doubt the greek government would release a statement if a newspaper based in greece suddenly claims foreign soil . 
  not apologize or anything , just condemn the piece and make it clear that although the editor and writer are free to express their opinion on this and any matter , and will not be prevented in any way from doing so in the form of being censored , that the article does not represent the official position of the greek government , and the greek government kindly advises newspapers to respect foreign sovereignty agreed upon in treaties , and foreign parties refer to official statements for clarification . 
  is that too much to ask of the turkish government ? 
  of course it is . 
  no it could n't , let 's be real . 
  not showing up to the correspondents dinner is n't the same as imprisonining journalists and the opposition . 
  appointing a vaguely conversvative judge to the supreme court is n't the same as institutional takeover . 
  trump has n't gone againgst the millitary , the police , the academic community , he did n't sensor the internet or built a fucking 1000 room palace to rule the country when he inevitably abolishes the republic and takes over . 
  trump is a moronic manbaby but erdogan is actually imprisonining people and taking over a whole country from within as we speak . 
  where is any perspective anymore ? 
   same way `` boring '' politicians , or doing the right unpopular thing does n't get political traction . 
  sure , but we 're currently at the opposite of that which is breaking news every time donald trump did anything in the primaries , and we 've seen where that leads . 
  usually the bigger stories of the day as such get posted on r/greece . 
  stuff like who is on strike and for what reason , and general news sources from within greece are posted there . 
  there are multiple peaceful demonstrations literally every single day in athens . 
  every single day multiple groups are protesting something on the steps of the a ministry but the media will wait and wait until that 1/1000 case where morons start doing stupid shit to actually report on them and their demands , `` bringing it on athens , this year demonstrations turned violent yet again '' . 
  why ? 
  because we have footage of it and we can get more eyeballs reporting controversial and self defeating behavior than reporting an actual just and civil protest with actual demands . 
  i am for free markets and capitalism as it gets but the profit motive in the mainstream media needs to fucking die already . 
  i do n't know how we can fund them so that they can actually report actual news , i think the best way is to just abandon them and let them die for now . 
  so experts say there is a 50 % chance of grexit and a 75 % chance of the euro keeping on as is without grexit happening ? 
  do those experts not know how probability works ? 
  it came down from 4 % of gdp to about 2 % . 
  is n't that a good thing ? 
  do we have to keep up with a country of 80 million people ? 
  we have to cut spending from somewhere . 
  millitary seems like a good start . 
  plus ever since the lisbon treaty you guys are obligated to come to our aid if erdo goes apeshit . 
  [ no contest ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im72mbaxlpi ), 
  eu territory in cyprus . 
  i am talking about the region in general , not just greece . 
  in most european countries the majority of people want it . 
   your taxes are comparable with ours . 
  thank your for the good laugh, 
   you can not deny that a lot of your spending was caused by corruption ( sometimes including german companies ) by an arms race with turkey ( that goes beyond what is necessary for country defence ) and misled spending ( like your hovercrafts ) . 
  sure , there were famously 2 cases of corruption in the greek military , one with two faulty submarines that we bought from a german company and we paid for even though the contract was n't observed , and one with parts for tanks in which money was maybe moved to the pockets of some greek politicians . 
  but that 's argument in favor of what ? 
  cur our military spending ? 
  would you cut your military spending if poland was ruled by a quasi dictator moron who made it his business to create grey zones in eastern germany , constantly violated your territorial waters and airspace ? 
  we were cut of from europe during the ottoman era , the cold war , to wars in the balkans , we 're affected every day by what happens in the middle east , and in north africa . 
  our military is n't a luxury , it 's actually almost adequate for the part of the world in which we happen to be in , that 's all there is to it . 
  and since any conflict in eu territory will drag us all in , maybe thank us , you know , just a little bit ? 
  i actually have to make sacrifices for the peace we all experience . 
  i will waste a year of my as a conscript and will pay the highest taxes in my country 's history so that you will never have to . 
  why not ? 
  people forget this but a european army was the plan for the very beginning . 
  there is n't such a thing as a threat to one european country that is n't a threat to all of us . 
  ever since the coal and steal community the idea was that the countries of europe should pull their military resources together so that war between us is n't just unlikely , but impossible . 
  a common chain of command is the next logical step , nato became exactly that . 
  had n't it been for the cold war , it would probably be a step that we would have made on the european level far sooner , before there even the european union . 
  nato does n't have to go away necessarily . 
  it can change to a be a deal between the eu and us armies . 
  but if the americans do n't like the idea , that 's still probably fine , we will still get our army , and britain after brexit can go ahead and claim its rightful place as airstrip one . 
  actually as a result of the debt crisis , military spending in relation to gdp has been reduced faster than even nominal gdp . 
  also countries deep in europe surrounded by allies have frankly no business schooling us on spending money on our military . 
  you are not in close proximity to russia and the middle east . 
  your neighbors respect the treaties you made with them and your territory is neither occupied nor disputed by the moron next door . 
  we have already endorsed their membership , so long as they use the name former yugoslav republic of macedonia . 
  they are the ones who do n't . 
  just like everything else in this country the idea that we are being an obstacle to their membership is a myth . 
  their strategy is the same as turkeys . 
  do n't improve , do n't meet the criteria , do n't open any chapters , that way we can point to greece and say : `` see they are n't letting us in '' and shame our way in . 
  in reality we do n't care much about it . 
  leopards actually means crazy lion . 
  pard coming for greek \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2 pardalos which means sick ( metaphofically ) or crazy . 
  crazy most likely refers to the fur pattern , not the animal itself . 
  keep in mind that greeks would have seen only the skin of these animals as they came from the silk road , and not necessarily the animal itself , so we had to make assumptions . 
  why not ? 
  i know where you 're getting this but in reality we 're all connected here . 
  if we had a system in which some countries formed more integration layers with it harming the rest of the eu and the rest of the eu had no say , that would n't be so good . 
  as an aegean islander i highly doubt that . 
  i had to walk 15 minutes from the port of mykonos to the town and i forgot my sunscreen at home ( an island nearby ) i developed fucking 1st degree burns . 
  there is no greek law on the national or the regional level explicitly banning same sex marriage , however there is no law affirming it either and due to how greek law works that does n't necessarily mean that same sex marriage licences ( which some municipalities have attempted to issue all the way back since 2001 , i think ) are recognized by other municipalities . 
  ever since 2015 , all administrative bodies must accept to issue and recognize civil partnerships for all couples which are legally equivalent to marriage minus the right to jointly adopt children . 
  the maker of the piece must have decided that since slovenia sold exactly the same thing as `` same sex marriage '' recently , that might suddenly include us in the ssm legal fray . 
  it really does n't work like that though and we and slovenia should probably be in the green . 
  fun fact . 
  in greek we still call the island albion as in ( \u0391\u03bb\u03b2\u03b9\u03ce\u03bd\u03b1 - alviona ) . 
  in fact the whole name for the country was for many centuries \u0393\u03b7\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03ac \u0391\u03bb\u03b2\u03b9\u03ce\u03bd\u03b1 ( girea alviona - old lady albion ) .
