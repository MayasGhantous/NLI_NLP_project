  and to be fair , mostly are . 
  i do n't know . 
  it 's not a new trend . 
  rock and metal has always been in high regard , even my parents listen . 
  please do , so we then use it as a proof of concept to span the adriatic !, 
  is this an earthquake ? 
  nope . 
  [ it 's churchill spinning in his grave . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/council_of_europe#history ), 
  i think `` votes '' rhyme with `` votes '' in every language . 
   the politician that finally takes a step forward will assure his place in history . 
  if there is a law of the universe , it 's this : politicians wo n't do controversial things because politicians do nothing out of principle . 
  the only difference between the uk and greece is that our politicians appear to be totally and utterly shameless about it whereas in the uk they have the good sense ( and cynicism required ) to play political theater . 
  i 've been following both the 2015-2016 `` fuck the eu summer vote '' and i can tell you with certainty , they are underline the same ordeal ( yes the eu is in a position of power over its member states , all of them , always was ) . 
  but i ca n't help but see a difference here . 
  even though the amount of theater that goes on by politicians is also pretty much the same , the quality of the play in the uk is far greater i must say . 
  i hear there is still a person in britain that thinks that britain is honestly truly leaving the eu when there is a prime minister pretending to be doing it while blatantly undermining the whole concept by the day . 
  and to that person i say : sorry , ( insert your name here ) , i will believe the ( insert country abbreviation here ) exit when i see it , not when people vote for it . 
  i have good reason to do so . 
   while one could argue that greece might have avoided this economic mess were it not part of the eu , leaving the eu does nothing to fix it . 
  you 're not exactly wrong , but i think you 're missing the biggest picture . 
  the bailouts are just one of the reasons greece will never leave the eu , but by far the 2 most important reasons is tourism from the eurozone and shipping of eurozone goods . 
  these things are n't trivial , they are our bread and butter . 
  if we loose uninterrupted access to these sectors and leverage of these markets , it 's over for us . 
  this might sound cruel but the debt crisis let to about 22 % of the economy disappearing . 
  of what 's left , 60 % + directly depends on these 2 sectors . 
  the thought that a big part of that 60 % could go away at any moment on top of the depression right now is why the greek government will suck every single last person in brussels if they have to , to ensure the vital economic links in these industries . 
   it would be beneficial for everyone if greece just left `` we have made a questionable investment , let 's now ensure that it becomes even worse . '', 
  said noone . 
  ever . 
  it 's like going on horse racing , betting on the cow , and the shooting in in the foot for good measure . 
  why would anyone do that ? 
  what happens is the eu knows greeces weakness too well . 
  they know that even going as far as saying that greece may exit the eu or the eurozone at some point puts pressure on these industries which will make greek politicians do anything . 
  well , do n't ask me , i did n't make it . 
  [ slightly more interesting map ] ( https://www.unodc.org/images/gsh/maps/revolving-map3.gif ), 
  it 's fucking embarrassing , honestly . 
  they celebrate christmas twice ? 
  [ wow . 
  til !, 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/11329660/where-is-christmas-being-celebrated-on-january-7.html ), 
  no it 's not . 
  that 's `` russia and friends '' christmas . 
  most orthodox churches have adopted the gregorian calendar and celebrate christmas at december the 25th . 
   syriza is neither marxist nor far left https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/syriza#former_constituent_parties educate yourself . 
   i actually am way better than those who voted for a party who ... blah blah blah . 
  still as ignorant , which is in no way better . 
   unfortunately we had no other choice bullshit . 
  you could have voted for 20 other parties , all with different manifestos that you probably did n't even bother to read . 
  if your thought process was at any point : `` i do n't feel like there are any good choices '' therefore `` i have to vote for a fringe literal marxist far-left ideologue '' , i want you to know that you are in no way better than the hundreds of thousands of people who voted for golden dawn out of ignorance , and you deserve everything you get from this government . 
  next time you do n't like the major parties , vote for the greens or pirates or something , or that chick who sings about the `` ellada '' movement . 
  at least we 're gon na have a good laugh in parliament sessions instead of wanting to kill ourselves every time one shows up . 
   if i were greek , i would have absolutely no confidence in the current administration . 
  yeah , i do n't , none of us does , i hope , but it 's not for looking unprofessional and having a light attitude . 
  i am fine with people that do n't have a stick up their ass , and i do n't consider it disrespectful to have some fun . 
  this government does n't suck because they are informal , they suck because they are a shitty government with no substance . 
  there is industry in greece , especially in the north . 
  dont you have better uses for your singe brain cell ? 
  let 's ask [ the map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/t5wjutu.jpg ) there is literally only 1 periphery in the entire country that is not a swing state and reliably votes against conservatives . 
  crete . 
  agreed . 
  and why is n't fellow romanesque france with us ? 
  to be fair , texans probably are n't insane either . 
  it 's the same reason people think they are insane and make jokes about it . 
  it 's merry * christmas but i had a good laugh anyway , so up it goes ... 
  all the regions in greece have an accent associated with that region . 
  it 's really only after national media like tv came about that the `` proper '' accent became widespread . 
  dialects are also a thing . 
  ask crete and cyprus . 
  pasok killed these things in the 80s . 
  rip . 
  at first i wrote `` who even lives there ? '', 
  but then i remembered ... oh yeah , i do . 
  but ... how ? 
  the sun tries to kill it all !, 
  til berlin is germany . 
   jk usually implies that you made a joke . 
  i really do n't understand what your problem is . 
   is there really that much of a difference between a keft\u00e9s and a kempapi yes . 
  kebab = lamb and beef meatball . 
  keftes = pork and beef meatball . 
  bifteki = meatball made of 1 kind of meat ( usually just beef , but could really be anything ) . 
  the more you know !, 
  in athens [ this ] ( http://www.psitopoleio-ogiorgos.gr/images/katalogos/souvlakia_tylixta.jpg ) is what we call souvlaki . 
  the entire tilihto and everything . 
  if you order `` one souvlaki ap-ola '' expect a tilihto , if you say `` one kalamaki ap-ola '' , expect meat on a stick with bread . 
  it 's close but not quite there . 
  it 's not that it is n't a big city , and it is kind of a liberal bastion for the north , but it 's more alike its surroundings than different . 
  but it 's in that unique position it really could go either way . 
  it 's a city full of contradictions . 
  i do n't know , the very idea of chicken kebab sounds wrong to me . 
  what we call kebab in greece , looks like [ this ] ( http://www.yiannislucacos.gr/sites/default/files/term224_kembap.jpg ) , and it 's the meat ( mixture of lamb and beef with some easterly stuff thrown in ( ??? 
  ) ) , rather than the method of making it , that gives it it 's name . 
  in contrast , gyros ( which we all agree it 's named like that ) is more of a method of preparing meat . 
   pork can you really claim it if you wo n't even eat it ? 
   do you know where this divide comes from the same as in all countries . 
  you have conservative homogeneous flyover country made of small communities , and you also have liberal big cities and touristy places that are a lot more cosmopolitan . 
  please post a picture of what you think souvlaki is . 
  i would agree with you but i actually think that in the case of greece it 's actually quite fitting . 
  it 's more of a cultural divide than a political one .
