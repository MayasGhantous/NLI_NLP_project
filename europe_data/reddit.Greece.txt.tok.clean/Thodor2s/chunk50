  here is a basic sentence in linear b and modern greek : linear b : ^ ^ ( sorry , ^ ^ could n't ^ ^ find ^ ^ a ^ ^ linear ^ ^ b ^ ^ unicode ^ ^ typer ) ho horokos atoropose in iheros modern greek : \u039f \u03cc\u03c1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b9\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 . 
  o orkos too anthropou ine ieros, 
  i am talking about his constitutional and academic work , but sure i think any great leader would have to take extreme measures when they were dealing with the balkan wars , ww1 and royalists . 
  theory is not the same as practice . 
  but his principles of trust are still the way government accountability is judged around the world . 
  here 's the rest of the list for greece : 2 ) george papanikolaou : the father of cytopathology , and the first doctor to correctly identify and isolate cancer cells . 
  1883-1962 3 ) theodore kolokotronis : the legendary old man of morea . 
  the general who embodied and enabled the greek war of independence more than any other . 
  1770-1843 4 ) konstantine karamanlis : the ouster of the monarchy and the military dictatorship and the signatory of the 3rd republican constitution of greece . 
  1907-1998 5 ) socrates : the man who pretty much birthed western philosophy , nuff said . 
  469-433bc 6 ) aristotle : this guy was wrong , ** a lot ** . 
  and very influential for millennia despite being wrong . 
  ** a lot ** . 
  in retrospect i do n't think he is a good pick . 
  384-322bc 7 ) eleftherios venizelos : the man who literally wrote the rulebook of democratic representative governments , and among other things , the signatory of the 2nd republican constitution of greece . 
  1864-1936 8 ) ioannis kapodistrias : i am gon na gush here . 
  words can not describe how much of a fucking legend this guy is . 
  easily my pick for number 1 . 
  think about this : you work for the tzar and you find yourself in switzerland , in 1813 , basically a nation at the verge of civil war . 
  napoleon had been royally buttfucking europe destroying centuries old german states , and the germans are pissed with the french . 
  but the big guys of europe at the time are tired of war and want the swiss to just shut up about it . 
  so what did kapodistrias do ? 
   a ) he just shrug and said , fuck it , what damage can the clock makers do anyway ? 
  -  b ) he gave russian backing to a nearby country to just ... take care of this mess ... as literally anyone else would have done in his place . 
  -  c ) inspired by ancient athenian law and fascinated with the prospect of influencing the creation of a country , he ** basically wrote the basics of the swiss constitution literally overnight ** and promptly sent it to the diet and the cantons who promptly approved it . 
  you guessed it . 
  and the swiss still consider him the first citizen of switzerland and vote directly and are neutral to this day . 
  he then casually quit to become the first governor general of his country of origin where he got into some serious statebuilding . 
  he ultimately failed to write an even awesomer constitution for greece though . 
  he was seen as too radical towards direct democracy by his opponents who then promptly assassinated him . 
  ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ greece ^ ^ ^ has ^ ^ ^ basically ^ ^ ^ been ^ ^ ^ shit ^ ^ ^ ever ^ ^ ^ since . 
  1776-1831 9 ) plato : refer to 5 , socrates . 
  427-345bc 10 ) pericles : `` made athens great again '' 495-429bc and i am like : of all of this , you go with alexander ? 
  i get that he was like ... a living legend . 
  and he is probably the greatest what if of history . 
  without him there is no hellenistic period and without the hellenistic period in the eastern mediterranean there is no spreading of christianity , no preserved classical texts . 
  it would be a very different world out there . 
  but that 's pretty much an accident , he is not up there , i am sorry . 
  whatever . 
  they association strongly believed in something and took a stance of principle , ca n't blame them for that . 
  big fucking deal . 
  and those who wear socks and sandals , do n't forget them . 
  so your pet peeves are really with op and not with my explanation ? 
  because i sorta disagree with the assuunptions of op as well . 
  no the greeks were not colorblind . 
  yes there is strong evidence that they did n't have words or a concept of color . 
  ie : original homeric writing . 
  and color is arbitrary , different sets of color did develop among different cultures and interestingly they even developed at largely the same pattern which is fascinating . 
   all of these languages have color terms that we can reconstruct to a form even * before * greek and the other indo-european languages drifted apart . 
  this makes the claim that the greeks have no words for colours very unstable . 
  actually you are bringing up something extremely interesting , because yes indo-european languages share words for colour and yet : the same word can mean different colours depending on the language . 
  example english black having the same root as italian bianco , which is white . 
  and there still is n't a one to one correlation between the colours of all languages . 
  english and greek are two pie languages . 
  but the word \u039c\u03c0\u03bb\u03b5 ble ( greek for blue ) is borrowed and the words \u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc galano ( light blue ) is older than that , yet not part of english . 
  so it 's much trickier than it would seem . 
  yes there are common words that are of pie origin , but there 's actually evidence to suggest that they were n't color names at all , they were things like `` flash '' `` blood '' `` night '' etc. 
  tl ; dr : it 's complicated . 
  but colours are actually a construct and words for them developed more recently that we would imagine . 
   a trans muslim with a cuckhold fetish is this the ariane 5 ? 
  because my sides are in orbit . 
  is this ancient rome colorized ? 
  the romans had insignia but they did n't exactly have ... flags . 
  flags are actually a way recent invention . 
  like ... 1400s recent . 
   no , http://imgur.com/a/hvnim and all those illustrations , are n't accurate , like at all . 
  i am sure it was convenient for the artist to have 2 color pallets of soldiers , but ancient greek warfare was n't like this . 
  it was decentralized , everyone had pretty much custom made gear , either crudely made by themselves of crafted by professionals . 
  there were some standards , but they were mostly of practical and defense nature , and color and insignia was never one of them . 
  so actual ancient greek warfare look nothing like this . 
  oh and also , yes , egyptians had paintings because they were n't colorblind . 
  just like the greeks , they could actually describe the colors , and they could simulate them , which is to say ... paint . 
  much in the same way you can hum a tune without necessarily understanding or being consistent about which notes you 're humming . 
  ehm ... you know that they did n't have battle standards and flags in ancient times ... right ? 
  ancient battles were chaotic as hell , everyone was wearing whatever and there as no cohesion and close to no insignia and definitely no flags . 
  i did n't blame anyone else for the problems of my country . 
  i just ca n't see the logic in complaining about not receiving receipts when you yourself do n't make it your business that the law is enforced . 
  in your country you get receipts automatically because if you did n't , the customer would be outraged . 
  is it so hard to treat greek businesses the same when you come over ? 
  there 's more than 30 million tourists every year now and they 're still by far the easiest targets for tax-evasion . 
  that 's not cool . 
  and for the record , i never accept anything without a receipt so ** i ** am not responsible for any of this shit , either . 
   black , blue , red etc. 
  are imperative to describe almost anything . 
  it really is n't though . 
  like think about it how many times you actually describe an object as black , blue or red in everyday speech . 
  fairly little i bet , and when you do it 's usually surrounded by similar objects . 
  you could use other identifiers . 
  and also red is not the same thing as black , the fact that they are both things included in the same category of colors should speak volumes to how much of a construct the whole thing is . 
  care to explain how ? 
  i think only 4 countries out of the entire eurozone had a budget surplus in 2016 and greece was one of them . 
  like i am not anti-jokes based on our troubles but a ) it has to be ... you know ... an actual joke which is to say funny and b ) it has to be accurate , otherwise it 's not really based on anything . 
  bump . 
  i would totally vote for juncker , this man is love !, 
  it 's not that ancient greeks were functionally colorblind , it 's just that the greek language initially lacked any any concrete words for color , and there is evidence to suggest that all prehistoric peoples before that also largely did n't understand the concept of colors . 
  it might seem baffling to you , but think about this : i went to a music high school , since most of my peers were trained in music from a young age , they had developed absolute pitch by that time , which means that they could name and recreate individual notes . 
  for us , this was important , and since we were in an environment where everyone cared about this , it was not uncommon to have discussions like this : `` when i am cold my low voice firmly drops to sol and i hate the sound of it '' `` how come ? 
  sol is my favorite tune '' . 
  to you , this probably does n't make the blindest bit of sense , but trust me , it 's not because you ca n't hear it , but because it does n't matter to you , you and society at large have n't taken the time to sit down and name the pitches , pick your favorite , talk about it , pick your favorite scale . 
  but that 's exactly what people did with colors over the millennia .
