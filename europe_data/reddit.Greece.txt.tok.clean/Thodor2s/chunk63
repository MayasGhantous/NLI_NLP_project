  how awesome was it that there was once a huge ass country thats spanned from austria all the way to us . 
  there is no other part of europe that irritates me to look up so much as the western balkans , you know ... to me the other countries of europe seem , for the most part , organically formed : those mountains over there ? 
  that 's switzerland . 
  that coast ? 
  portugal . 
  those peninsulas and the islands around them ? 
  italy , greece , denmark . 
  and for the most part there 's the big countries ( by area ) and a few small countries and microstates for spicing things up . 
  but the western balkans i ca n't get behind . 
  there are so many small and wierdly shaped countries in such a small area , it 's painful to look at ... 
  especially in maps that superimpose country names . 
  it 's such a clusterfuck . 
  please tell me it 's not just me . 
  and how is this bad , exactly ? 
  every euro of real estate development is valuable and very welcome . 
  the construction industry in greece has been really suffering , so that will help them , and also rich tend spend really well on their playgrounds , so that 's also good for us . 
  it 's not , but it 's not nothing . 
  the unemployment rate in greece peaked at 28 % in 2013 and is going nothing but down ever since , so it 's not like greece is an outlive and does n't benefit at all from eu policy . 
  in fact , this along with the little progress in greece from the past 2 administrations is greatly removing pressure from the european average . 
  post dutch and german ones then . 
  r/greece is fine for memes and jokes and as far as circlets go , it probably is the best . 
  political discussion there is super toxic though . 
  i bet most people do n't know that up until a century ago there were 3 modern hellenic languages : demotic ( the greek predominantly spoken today , the one decendant of koine ) as well as pontic and tsakonian decendant by regional variants of ancient greek . 
  sadly pontic greek is not spoken anymore and tsakonian is only spoken by a sliver of people around sparta . 
  it 's a reasonable window . 
  if greece gets a little bit of qe it would be for the best . 
  and no kastelorizo :(, 
   now pay them debts ... said like a poet . 
  such a breathtakingly original comment . 
  truly tapped into untreated territory here . 
  and greece too , do n't forget greece . 
  shame that a child had to suffer and die , but other than that , i have no objections in stupid people failing to infect the future genepool of humanity with their stupid genes via their offspring . 
  i am a sucker for natural selection . 
   conservatives like companies  companies like cheap labour you tell me . 
  edit : also fuck you autocorrect , it 's spelled labour . 
  because britain has pretty much the worst electoral system in the world , where in most cases you basically know beforehand who will represent your constituency in parliament , and since there is n't any truly national preference ballot , like we have here , if you intent to vote for a small party that has no chance of getting the seat where you live , ( say ... the lib-dems ) you might as well write lib dems on a piece of paper and set it on fire instead of showing up to vote , because that 's exactly how much it matters . 
  `` legend says '' i call bs . 
  it looks to me like a pagan traditions that christians took over . 
  deported is deplorable , but it 's not the same kind of deplorable as mass killings and genocide . 
  how do you know everyone is sleeping and not secretly silently and helplessly listening to you as you wake them up with even the most minute noise in the quiet that is the middle of the night ? 
  they might as well have already left it though . 
  only for greek students . 
  can someone provide source on this ? 
  is there any text out there of the directive or regulation being voted upon ? 
  that 's not an eli5 . 
  how about the hard data that we 're the only country in the eu with negative growth ? 
  is n't that enough ? 
  spain and portugal and cyprus stuck with reasonable policies and do n't play rebels without a cause every 3 months , are now out of their memorandums and register quarterly growth for about 3 % all the while we sink further and further into syrizas bullshit . 
  you really have to be in reality of your own to not realize until that for all the problems the previous governments had , syriza is a disaster of a whole new level . 
   i 'm not entirely convinced that greece would have been so much better off had samaras remained . 
  all i read is : i do n't believe in math or statistics . 
  surprisingly , the government and employers likes strikes because they get to subtract penalties from salaries . 
  one day of delay is n't so bad for business if you get to subtract 3 or 4 days worth of salary from your employees for it . 
  play the video . 
  the one is a stock photo of an anarchist rally and the other is a peaceful march by unions on a general strike ... 
  i guess i should have said just that in the title , eh ? 
  exhibit b : [ the actual news story ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2017/05/17/greeks-walk-out-in-general-strike-over-new-austerity-measures ), 
  i 've said it before , probably to you . 
  requesting permission and submitting flight plans before flying planes ( any plane ) in the greek fir is literally all that the aviation authorities are asking for , otherwise it 's totally legal to turn your planes back as happens . 
  this is n't to say that fir is the same as territorial airspace . 
  nobody is saying that . 
  however it is customary for countries not at war , who tend to work with commercial aviation , to call their fir airspace , since for all practical purposes it might as well be . 
  google european airspace for example . 
  you 'll see nothing but fir maps . 
  and it 's not ignorant users that post these either , the first results are from eurocontrol and the european commission . 
  so be it . 
  we ca n't make friends with erdogan forever , not like this . 
  and even when it gets them , this plane is a fucking disaster . 
  euro-fighters and even old f-16s wipe their ass with it . 
  we better wish turkey really invests in the f35 . 
   greek self recognized air borders there is a thing in international law called the 12 mile limit , which is the sea and air that belongs to each country off their shore . 
  it is their sovereign territory . 
  whether or not and how a country exercises jurisdiction up to that limit is left up to each country to decide . 
  however international law gives all countries the right to do so up to that limit . 
  there is no basis for dispute in the aegean , greek `` self recognized air borders '' is in line with international law , and every country and territory in the world except turkey seem to agree . 
  nevermind that airspace between two countries at peace properly understood is the [ fir range ] ( http://globalskywatch.com/chemtrails/ubbthreads.php?ubb=download&amp;number=2739&amp;filename=eurocontrol_fir_and_uir_in_the_lower_airspace_-_12_march_2009.png ), 
  it 's not that expensive anyway . 
  the cost is sadly split for national and provincial museums but for 15 $ you can visit all the national museums for 3 days ( which include the archaeological museum , the byzantine museum , the numismatic museum and the epigraphic museum and many more ) . 
  as of provincial museums such as the acropolis museum , there is no universal ticket , but the price has an upper limit of 5 $ per museum . 
  so with 20 $ you 're pretty much covered and the money goes to a fund that helps preserve greek artifacts in museums all over the world , so it 's actually for a rather good cause . 
  and the prices are half if you 're under 18 , over 65 or a student , so there 's that . 
  well , i do n't know what your budget is , but here is the [ ultimate ancient greek trip ] ( https://www.google.gr/maps/dir/37.9695242,23.7268751/37.9760058,23.7232401/@37.9399928,23.6252796,11.81z/data=!4m59!4m58!1m55!3m4!1m2!1d23.7306628!2d37.9894583!3s0x14a1bd324aa0cfeb:0x59ab1652d0d4dc13!3m4!1m2!1d23.7291946!2d37.9832353!3s0x14a1bd3075ab432b:0x839932b07d395769!3m4!1m2!1d22.5013779!2d38.4809494!3s0x135f795d990f1bab:0x1a520d6ba24ad33b!3m4!1m2!1d21.7350263!2d38.2467336!3s0x135e49dd1b27fe33:0x22d384a643232611!3m4!1m2!1d21.625743!2d37.6512906!3s0x136092f8c3c2b4d9:0x80a98b27a1d9a1bc!3m4!1m2!1d21.9018281!2d37.4304479!3s0x1360585545550809:0x2b8b56d8ed25ada3!3m4!1m2!1d22.3740576!2d37.0703348!3s0x1361cc31e1ef86c3:0xf81f85f732c89cf2!3m4!1m2!1d22.4407081!2d37.0701928!3s0x1361d272636d9701:0xfdfdfafa94541316!3m4!1m2!1d22.7499735!2d37.7260682!3s0x14a00271b1361089:0x1729e936363a52c6!3m4!1m2!1d22.801579!2d37.5672618!3s0x149ffa997a3ebfeb:0xcf27925ddd0be4f9!3m4!1m2!1d23.0702537!2d37.5976162!3s0x149f8bb9b9ed5b97:0x2ffc263e65e2a5b4!1m0!3e0 ) now , it 's not that complicated , let me explain . 
  day 1 : acropolis and acropolis museum night 1 : sleep in athens day 2 : ancient agora of athens night 2 : sleep in athens day 3 : trip to the oracle of delphi , continue to patras night 3 : sleep in patras day 4 : that 's a big day . 
  you go to olympia , and if you have time there is the temple of epikouriou apollo on your way to sparta . 
  night 4 : sleep in sparta day 5 : archaeological sites at sparta including the castles of mistras , then go to nafplion . 
  night 5 : sleep in nafplion day 6 : you go to mycenae night 6 : you sleep at nafplion day 7 : you go epidavros , then corinth , then back to athens night 7 : sleep in athens day 8 : now that you have a concrete understanding of what you 'd been seeing , you may visit the national archaeological museum . 
  you 'd want to spent at least a whole day there . 
  this should cover at least 5 of the 7 [ world heritage sites ] ( http://whc.unesco.org/en/interactive-map/ ) on your path , maybe even more if you 're willing to extend this trip . 
  seeing how you come from far away you should probably not opt out from any of this , especially if you'e interested in ancient greek stuff . 
  it depends on where you 're from and where you 're going . 
  where would you like to go ? 
  island hopping ? 
  athens site-seeing ? 
  mainland trip ? 
   but assuming that greek have n't changed for 1000 years is plain wrong . 
  which is why i did n't say that or implied it in any way . 
  just the phonology of demotic greek was in place by the 11th century , not everything else , which is enough for linguists to label the language demotic . 
  as of the slavic languages , i have n't a freaking clue . 
  probably you 're right . 
  fun fact : in the 11th century the last phonological changes of medieval greek ( late roman - early byzantine periods ) were taking place , effectively creating demotic or what we now call `` modern greek '' .
