you have n't understood why we ca n't combat this phenomenon . 
  these people come with homemade shity boats and they either bail it mid seas and the coast guard or other ships must save them according to marine laws etc , or , they arrive in a random little island in mediterranean and then they get collected by the police or whoever is in charge of them , if of course they get caught by someone . 
  that 's why '' we '' do n't know where they come from or where they were born because there are no papers to prove that ( illegal entry ) . 
  i hope that makes some sense and clears the confusion . 
  other than that i kinda agree with you . 
  i concure . 
  i happen to listen both electronic and rock ( and some metal ) and german 's presence is felt a lot, 
  this is big news and yet none mentions that on tv . 
  ( at least in greece and in ireland i hear ), 
  same shit different day really, 
  after that i guess you wouldnt feel the need to go to toilet ... 
  hey , i can try sending you a card from greece , crete if you 'd like it , 
  yeap its pretty good !, 
  i believe the same , even though i hate them , it doesnt mean they cant express their thoughts in the parliament in a democratic country . 
  on the other hand...10-15 % of voters , voted for them , seriously ? 
  dem brains : /, 
  i wo n't bother with that mate , i wish people would see how much and how many taxes we need to pay ( yes the average joe does pay taxes ) until the end of this fiscal year . 
  if that 's the case you say about uncompleted buildings i can safely say to you that it certainly is n't correct . 
  we have a 2 story building where we stay , it 's been completed over 15 years ago and you can see those columns extended on the tarace , as i said it 's for future development where on complete 5 story buildings these are not extended as the maximum permitted floors are reached . 
  ( they are rustproof painted of course . ), 
  until today we pay the taxes government assigns to each tenant / building owner without a miss and let me tell you it hurts a lot when you are rarely payed min wage . 
  i could write a summary of costs to see the outrageous situation, 
  lol , no . 
   this happens because if you want to raise another floor ( until the maximum allowed 5 story building ) , reinforced concrete must have something to be built upon and be stable if an earthquake , for example , happens . 
  having the raised-extended columns for that , makes it more cost/time efficient for future building construction . 
  these tax dodging stories are getting tiring . 
  : / ( not that it doesnt happen though but thats a story for another night ), 
   very ~ ~ worst tourists ~ ~ best women nuff said :p, 
   at noon it was so hot that we usually made a very long nap . 
  thats why we are so ... unproductive :p, 
  well i am not by any means supporter of the orthodox christianism but here in greece this logic does n't exist . 
  everything being sold in eu comes with 24 month warranty . 
  i am sure it was , i could watch it in digital transmition, 
  nice try spider fuckers . 
  greece needs you !, 
  it 's funny that , people with english as a native language make more gramatical errors than everyone else as second language .

  it 's better because we now do n't have any hopes of things being improved and at least we have closure . 
  accepted, 
  i see !!, 
  what if i know a bit of french ? 
  dunno , because thats the word that describes what iwant to say , like `` chef '' , how else would you say that , master cook ? 
  you can mouse-over it , it should say greece !, 
  after beer . 
  frappe is kill, 
   and why do you have so less school ? 
  the chart is wrong , at least from this year on , the school days are 170-173 according to a bit of googling . 
  as for the quality of them , i think teaching methods being outdated is one reason we scored low . 
  go go greece !, 
  edit : the chart is wrong , at least from this year on , the school days are 170-173 according to a bit of googling . 
  no love for greece ? 
  now we shall find the inventor of the cigarette, 
  you know some people really sympathize with us in a way or another . 
  that receipt thing is happening here too ... 
  i guess what i have heard about italy being the same as greece is true . 
  til, 
  how does this solves anything ? 
  it 's . 
  cnn ... 
  fuck you . 
  / u/theomnisicient come here, 
  it is sad minding your own business and the next second you are in a trainwreck . 
  how could this happen , 2 trains to be in a single rail ? 
  is n't there any system to monitor them ? 
  yeah the door frames are supposed to stand quite well . 
  but you know , most people panic and * run into accidents *, 
  yeah then it was far , if it was closer and shallower you would shit your pants :-p, 
  no earthquake that strong as far as i remember . . maybe it was 5.5 on the richter max, 
  i read that ( and probably is the case ) there are much more it positions there , than here in greece . 
  i hope i will find something as an aspiring system administrator . 
  living in another country would be a nice change of lifestyle too , going outside of my comfort zone etc , 
  thanks , i will be researching these recommendations . 
  i will be staying in sofia , do n't know exactly where , but , i would like to learn about your history , see the buildings etc. 
  some friends of mine went for skiing in bansko , but i could n't go due to classes , i heard they had fun though !, 
  looking forward to it actually , maybe , someday , i can work there in it . 
  thinking of visiting bulgaria soon to my neighbor living there atm ( he does n't like greek summer ) . 
  there 's an addon on firefox for automatically accepting these called , i do n't care about cookies . 
  google it, 
  yet one more time this country disappoints me, 
  more like 8 years, 
  thanks,
