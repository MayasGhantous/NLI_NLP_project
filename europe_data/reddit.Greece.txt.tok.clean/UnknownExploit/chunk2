  can someone link the part 1 ( 300 ~ photos ) please ? 
  well ... 
  he is a murderer in the sense of not having a safe boat, 
  my body is ready for some natasha, 
  well most * ca n't * pay any taxes without some kind of income, 
  yeah that money were spent for hookers and coke . 
  we need more . 
  oh , thanks for correcting me then . 
  the founder ~ ~ stole ~ ~ the commonly known recipe from some tibetian / chinese / something guy while he was there . 
  literally what i was thinking reading the title, 
  til !, 
  i would say closer to american than british for most of us, 
  it 's like kostandinou kai elenis all over again, 
  wow , really beautiful, 
  yes the second example can be said , if you are in hurry that is . 
  but both are somewhat heavy to say towards somebody , maybe enough to get you in a fight . 
  bonus video ( the guy said \u03b3\u03b1\u03bc\u03ce \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 and got slapped by the monk ) : https://youtu.be/qtbgxdsxtkc, 
  despite crazy high percentage of the population considers themselfs orthodox christians , we have a very common insult : \u03b3\u03b1\u03bc\u03c9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5 / \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5 ( = fuck your christ / holy mother ) i am agnostic myself, 
  yeah my thoughts exactly, 
  i already feel that way, 
  what kind of car is that black 50s looking on the corner ? 
  hehe , surprisingly to me , in the age of icbms , we still have a geopolitical role, 
  that 's awesome lol, 
  most of the photos are not available , mirror anyone ? 
  you and me both, 
  do n't panic , do n't try to be a hero, 
  fun fact , game of thrones production team wanted to film in greece but they abandoned the idea because of the bureaucracy . 
  think they got denied by the local government, 
  yes but that still makes you the archshiters ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  i get that reference, 
  they pay to be on skroutz , and it 's lots of euros ... 
  i mean per view even, 
  imagine us ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) but ... at the end of the day we will still pay exorbitant electricity prices, 
  this is the film : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0301357/, 
  these people are pain in the ass , i traveled with them once with the line ship , so obnoxious . 
  i do n't think this is happening, 
  i want to visit too , my neighbor has a flat in sophia , he said he can host me sometime . 
  ohhh , 
  same thing here , but replace 1000 with 700 . 
  also your user name means chicken :-p, 
  i 'm in too !, 
  it is physically possible to enter, 
  chill out man, 
  you mean north part as it hurts more developed countries like germany, 
  in 30 years there will be 2 million ( total population of 8 million if not less ) less greeks around so , * do n't worry we will * ... 
  i have some if any of you want . 
  pure virgin oil . 
  i gib oil , you gib money . 
  so what , in another comparison we contribute 75 % of moldavia 's gdp in nato , statistics mean shit without context . 
  i am not going to continue this pointless argument . 
  have a nice day, 
  wtf , why would i delete my comment ? 
  i honestly do n't know what are you talking about , i gave you my insight , take it as you want, 
  you want me to photocopy my grandma 's papers ? 
  when half a million of workers are immigrants in other countries , the percentages go up . 
  plus , unless i am reading this wrong , most were pensioneers years before any law went into action , and at that age ( 55 ) you get a minor pension if you meet some of the criterias . 
  also consider most of these , people if they can even get that pension , have been unemployed with no extra income whatsoever for years . 
  pension is around 350 euros per month fyi, 
  in your previous comment you did make a big generalization , thats why i told you that . 
  up voted for the sourced comment, 
  he is kind of right , you just pull numbers, 
  top kek, 
  not that wierd , we suck at this kind of stuff, 
  i really wish someone would start a `` serious '' conversation with people such as her , and ask why they carry it as a pet . 
  maybe she was a pokemon trainer ? 
  it 's not entirely false though . 
  the german tanks were struggling to get going in the mud and snow because of their wheels and tracks, 
  gopnik lyfe is de best, 
  yeah , imagine your grandma carrying grocery bags, 
  good news !, 
   you did by borrowing 220 % of your gdp lol , you know before we had any austerity measures and `` help '' , the debts were at 180 % of our gdp . 
  that 's why they call it '' 1000 yards stare '', 
  man you are fucking wrong and stone headed.that money came from a surplus , which came from taxpayers themselfs . 
  it is :-p, 
  as a greek , i feel your pain, 
   there is absolutely no point in referring to ~ ~ experts ~ ~ anymore politicians . 
  ftfy, 
  in theory , yes maybe , but like communism , in practice things are way more different . 
  external help from organizations is rather useless , these people come here to mainly flirt with other like minded individuals , vacate and maybe play with some poor refugee kid in their free time . 
  greece has a refugee - immigrant problem since 2009 , years before eu started to acknowledge this . 
  only when it began to involve more countries they tried to managed it, 
  that 's great news !, 
   ( though there 's a small oil production going on , and plans for increasing it ) where ? 
  and that is working legally with papers not getting paid under the table, 
  you live in your bubble it appears, 
  actually iirc and if the poll is the same as the one referred in this post , there were plato , socrates etc contesting but alexander won . 
  at least we are first in something good !, 
  what 's the site ? 
  i want to search for a person i know, 
  we also have vending machines just for milk and related products, 
  even this country is made in china, 
  and designed in california, 
  talk about overexageration, 
  yeah most people work in food service and hotel industry for the season . 
  it 's nothing new, 
  tldr ? 
  yes i want kebab without onions, 
  huh , til . . 
   and apparently greece has the lowest in the world , even during economic crisis the sun helps . 
  helps a bit for me i can say .
