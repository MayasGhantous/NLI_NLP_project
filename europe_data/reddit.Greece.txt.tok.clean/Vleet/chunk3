  we should n't be allowed to democratically vote to shoot refugees on site at our borders ? 
  you fucking fascist scum !, 
  could it be that turkey ca n't play around with nato as much it can with the eu ? 
  ( edit : in case nato decides to help , will it affect the smugglers somehow?i ca n't really tell . ), 
  i do n't know whose idea it was to involve nato though , if germany pressured turkey to agree to it , it makes sense . 
  i do n't think nato would be involved just to become a ferry/rescue service , so i do n't think they would ever consider it a good decision to station the troops only in greek territory . 
  they know the problem can only be solved by stopping migrants on the turkish coast . 
  with everyone saying that the greek debt is unsustainable , and no real plan on how to make it sustainable , the greek economy will never be stable and no one will ever want to invest any money here . 
  so the `` there 's no problem now '' approach will just lead to another bailout or a grexit . 
  he either : 1 ) has poor taste in food . 
  2 ) is from a part of greece where using ketchup in souvlaki is the norm . 
  which means that he and his fellow citizens develop a bad taste while growing up by eating souvlaki with ketchup ( or mustard ) . 
  so the mitsotakis family just preferred siemens products because of their quality right ? 
  it 's a coincidence that most of them ( around 130.000 $ in total ) were paid for right after the siemens scandal broke out , right ? 
  kyriakos in particular paid siemens 44.000 $ for some of the products he had `` purchased '' the previous year , just three days after siemens ' employees testified that politicians were involved . 
  about intracom , no one is surprised . 
  any stone you turn in greece , you 'll find kokkalis beneath it . 
  he is a buddy of those two rotten parties that brought greece to this point as well . 
  ~ ~ also , since when is intracom russian ? ~ ~ edit : apparently i 'm dumb or blind ( or both ) . 
  why do you feel the need to point out that intracom is russian and it 's not mentioned together with siemens ? 
  is this some stupid attempt at making greeks sound like some russian buddy who whines about german companies and whitewashes `` russian '' ones ? 
   as you might imagine some of those people ( who experienced the greek occupation ) are actually still alive or at least their sons or daughters ( and i think this kinda makes it easier for those people to hate ) . 
  you ca n't really say the same for greeks . 
  `` according to the international league for the rights and liberation of peoples , between 1916 and 1923 , up to 350,000 greek pontians were reportedly killed in massacres , persecution and death marches . 
  merrill d. peterson cites the death toll of 360,000 for the greeks of pontus . '', 
  there are way more who survived and got to greece who have children and grandchildren . 
  those i know personally do n't really hold grudges , the past is in the past . 
  i have to say though , that an old co-worker of mine whose father was forced to leave during the [ istanbul pogrom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/istanbul_pogrom ) hates turks with a passion . 
  imo , much of the animosity towards turkey from the greeks comes from more recent events like the invasion and occupation of cyprus and events re-igniting the hate like the imia crisis and turkey behaving like a bully towards greece . 
  politicians play a big role in this as well . 
  how long till the muslims of thrace feel opressed and the sultan comes to liberate them ? 
  oh , i forgot they 've been living in peace here for all these years while turkey forced the greeks of contantinople out . 
  no , in fact i could n't vote because i was n't of legal age to vote . 
  the first elections i could vote for were the 2012 ones , where i chose to abstain as a kind of `` protest '' to our political parties . 
  i 'm fully aware that by abstaining , i still contribute to the outcome though . 
   now its `` the political system '' and how it `` destroyed our mindset '' so the system that papandreou created , where people could exchange favours for votes did n't create that fucked up mindset where the greek people would vote for anyone who promised the most `` free stuff '' ? 
   i am not the typical greek like you , to sit home and blame everyone else but myself . 
  the irony . 
  did i phrase it that wrong ( i did n't mean that greeks are right to blame germany ) ? 
  i said that saying `` 100 % of the greeks blame the germans '' is wrong . 
  i know greeks that blame the germans , greeks that blame the eu , the ez etc. 
  sure . 
  but i know greeks that blame our political system and the destruction it brought to the mindset of the greek people . 
  even those who `` blame germany '' know that . 
  what i meant is that you fit into another category of greek . 
  the one who thinks every other greek is a scumbag and that you are so different . 
  so , as you have an inferiority complex towards the more successful european citizens , you 're frantically trying to show them how different you are from the rest of the greeks . 
  the easiest way is to say `` 100 % of the greeks believe this and that '' like all greeks have the same stupid opinion on such a complicated matter . 
   pretty much 100 % of greeks ignore this . 
  but no , blame it on the germans . 
   it worrying because people are not aware how bad greece fucked up . 
  they think everything was going great and then the germans came in and ruined everything . 
  speak for yourself , not on the behalf of 100 % of greeks . 
  it 'll still allow you to fit in with the cool kids . 
  fucking inferiority complex ... 
  i hope that we 'll get to see the separation of church and state in the next 30 years . 
  or at least before i die . 
  he means that when cypriots started fighting for independence from gb , gb started some good old divide and rule shit . 
  read the context part [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/istanbul_pogrom#context ) . 
  according to / u/unknownexploit the number for greece is around 170-173 days a year , so we 're pretty much the same with spain and portugal . 
  [ and it helped so much !, 
  ] ( https://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2014/03/12/lessons-from-the-greek-psi/ )  this smacks of a ` revolving doors ' process for public debt , as proven in the case of greece where the psi reduced debt in 2012 by 13.4 % only to boost it again in 2013 by 19.3 % -- as the recapitalisation funds were borrowed by the state to compensate the banks for their ... psi losses . 
  genocide has replaced candy in the mouth of many nationalists . 
  that 's why [ this ] ( http://www.genocidescholars.org ) exists . 
  and [ oh my !, 
  ] ( http://www.genocidescholars.org/sites/default/files/document%09%5bcurrent-page%3a1%5d/documents/iags-resolution-assyrian%20and%20greek%20genocide.pdf ) , they 've recognized the genocide of pontian and anatolian greeks . 
  ca n't seem to find anything from iags about any greeks `` genociding '' turks . 
  do n't get confused , there 's a difference . 
  it 's not like , `` greeks did a bit of this , turks did a bit of that '' . 
  it 's more like `` greeks did a bit of this , turks did a lot of that '', 
  somehow you managed to turn what i said into a huge rant , like i need a finnish dude who has ~ ~ no knowledge ~ ~ limited knowledge ( coming from foreign/your country 's media and politicians ) about the greek situation , to tell me what 's wrong with my country . 
  i already know every single problem more in depth than you . 
  no point in arguing , you 're a lost cause . 
  i 'll just make clear that the `` your money '' was n't ironic , meaning that it 's not actually yours . 
  it was quoting you , maybe it was my fault , i changed it a bit to make it clearer . 
   biting the hand that feeds you ugh . 
  i can fully understand and accept it when someone believes that greece should n't be getting any bailout loans because `` it 's our ( our = whoever 's saying it ) money '' . 
  i do n't agree with it , but that probably has more to do with my country ending up with the short end of the stick . 
  making statements like the above , staying more focused on why greece should be punished for getting into trouble , while claiming you 're helping greece overcome those problems , is just fucked up though . 
  i 'm not in favor of such a move , i 'm just pointing out that greece would either have to leave by taking schaubles offer , or get totally destroyed ( the consequences would be dire either way ) . 
  if varoufakis is telling the truth , in case greece chose to leave the ez without following whatever programme schauble had in mind , it would n't be free to face its problems with the eu keeping a neutral stance . 
  we 'd pretty much have the eu against us , blocking any possible deals ( like it happened with china ) . 
  if greece chooses to leave the ez , we 'd have to be punished so no one questioned the euro ever again . 
  [ `` but first , let us make sure you 'll get the worst case scenario if you choose to do so '' ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/euro-finance/news/varoufakis-china-was-ready-to-support-greece-but-berlin-killed-the-deal/ ), 
  i thought that the only `` profits '' trainose was making , were due to money that the state was pouring into it . 
  no one did . 
  it 's just ~ ~ new democracy ~ ~ the greek media bullshitting . 
  taiped ( the greek privatisation agency ) [ made it clear ] ( http://news247.gr/eidiseis/oikonomia/taiped-oydepote-yphrkse-prosfora-300-ekat-eyrw-gia-thn-trainose.4171458.html ) that the only offer they ever had was the italian one . 
  edit : the previous government was talking about 300m price if it was to be sold . 
  a syriza member back then ( now minister ) said that the price was too low . 
  greek media now somehow turned this into `` the previous government had a 300m offer '' . 
  `` prices will be lower '' . 
  that 's what was supposed to happen . 
  prices are the same ( if not higher ) , but greek milk producers are getting destroyed by all the milk importing . 
  i think he was joking . 
  reclaiming `` lost land '' is not even a thought for most greek people . 
  it would be nice though if we could set our territorial waters at 12n . miles like most states in the world and have an eez . 
  or not having turkey putting claims on every fucking rock and small island on the aegean . 
  or not having to spend billions on our military . 
  somehow , people think that one has to either be pro-russia and hate the usa/nato or `` like '' the usa/nato and hate russia .
