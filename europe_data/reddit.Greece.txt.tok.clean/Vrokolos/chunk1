hi from debt buffer . 
  i can travel without a passport through fyrom and serbia into eu though . 
  just with my id . 
  just did it 1 month ago to visit belgrade . 
  can you explain both sides to me ? 
  ca n't disagree with you . 
  there are some main land cities like nafplio and metsovo that are still awesome, 
  fuck yes we suffer . 
  read this . 
  specially 5th point . 
  here . 
  the 5ft point of the first answer should cover you . 
  not only it was legal , but also encouraged by the government . 
  but it is n't related to rich people . 
  migrate or get older, 
  well yeah . 
  even if not historic , having that uniformity is quite nice . 
  instead of destroying nice buildings and replacing them with crap concrete blocks they could have at least added some artistic rules . 
  these are usually neoclassical buildings built in the 19th century . 
  not sure about the specific ones from the photograph but there are some few ones in main city centers : https://www.vgainoexo.gr/files/habanera-001t.jpg, 
  most greek islands are like that . 
  there are some few exceptions . 
  i doubt it 's overgrazing . . 
  it 's just the climate i think, 
  it 's too bad that our main land cities now only include a dozen of these kind of houses because we demolished 99 % of them in order to build ugly ass multistorey buildings edit : since many ask me why , read this and especially the fifth point of the first answer . 
  yes i believe they are pretty accurate . 
  greece is a very nice country to live in if you 're working online . 
  https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=spain&amp;country2=greece&amp;city1=madrid&amp;city2=athens the difference in rent is always pretty huge . 
  do n't know why our rent is so cheap compared to almost every other european country . 
  never been to spain so ca n't tell you any more . 
  this winter we 've got 1 week of -10 degrees in thessaloniki which is near the sea and not mountainous . 
  although that is nothing compared to your cold , it feels a lot colder than you think . 
  i 've lived 3 years in uk and imho cold weather in thessaloniki - in winter only !!, 
  - feels harsher than brighton . 
  in the summer though , greek weather ca n't be compared to northern european in any freaking way . 
  btw people do n't sit outside during winter to drink coffee . 
  this photo was taken in spring or autumn . 
  we 've got a lot of winter travel spots as well . 
  do not mistaken greece for a sea - summer only country . 
  most of the main land is mountainous : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geography_of_greece#/media/file:greece_topo.jpg, 
  sorry bruh i was referring to the downvoted to oblivion post below me, 
  yes we do . 
  what 's so bad about it ? 
  turkey calls greece yunanistan . 
  what 's so bad about that ? 
  even if what you say is true , it should be applauded . 
  they now fully embrace the greek culture and consider themselves greek . 
  if this thing happened now with other nations and the recent immigrants , things would be far peaceful in eu . 
  after so many years of disputing the name most foreigners ( except most of mmerica of course ) now know why we do it . 
  that fyromians are in no way related to ancient macedonians . 
  when this thing started most foreigners did n't really care or even know wtf was going on so they just dismissed it . 
  now that most people know it 's not that relevant anymore . 
  i believe it was a success from our side even though nothing ended yet . 
  what he means is this : http://sokfm.gr/morningshow/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/%ce%93%cf%8d%cf%81%ce%bf%cf%82.jpg real gyros is made from slices of meat pinned one by one . 
  that foreign gyros is just meatloaf crap . 
  greece is not cheap . 
  especially if you go to tourist traps like santorini or mykonos . 
  they are both beautiful but far too expensive . 
  try going to less tourist places . 
  here are some : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lefkada , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thasos , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pelion i personally prefer roadtripping throughout europe during august since prices in greece then are too expensive for greeks :(, 
  gyros is a pork version of doner . 
  if you 've never tried it you should . 
  but here in greece since the ones abroad are awful . 
   serbs and fyromians are a very similar people , it does n't make absolutely no sense . 
  they might be , their culture is also influenced by bulgaria and i ca n't put their difference to words so i suggest you go visit them and shape your own opinion . 
  also if you visit belgrade and novi sad get ready to be awed by some really hot \u03b3\u03ba\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1 , so hot that you 'll start learning serbian soon after . 
   so yeah i * personally * felt serbians closer to us . 
   also , you felt them closer to you , not to us . 
  yes us as in company of greek friends who went there . 
  username checks out, 
  the serbian - and orthodox - part of bosnia . 
  do n't shoot me if i did n't state it 100 % correctly , 
  you 're talking about nation relationships . 
  i 'm talking about people relationships . 
  politicians - theirs and ours - and history for whatever reason might have made you shape an opinion about the people you 've never met . 
  whenever i 've visited serbia i felt a connection with them . 
  fyrom not so much but still very friendly people . 
  the fact that we veto the name ( and it 's our right to do so ) does n't mean i hate all the fyromers . 
  i found them also very friendly - some even friendlier than greeks - whenever i visit them but that `` connection '' was n't there . 
  so yeah i personally felt serbians closer to us . 
  now if you want to talk about strategic alliances , i 'm not that versed in that so ca n't tell how friendly we currently are on strategic level . 
  not directly related to religion but your culture and way of life * also corruption !, 
  yay * is very similar to ours and thus we 're very friendly with each other . 
  so the orthodox thing should n't have been mentioned at all ( if it did get mentioned ), 
  til about naming, 
  i do n't like the movie but the portrayal of greeks is quite good imho . 
  also watch quo vado which although italian portrays greeks very well as well i think, 
  the important part is this if you missed it . 
  this is not gyros , it 's an abomination : https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wbcpmvkqqwa/hqdefault.jpg https://onmilwaukee.com/images/articles/be/bestgyros2016/bestgyros2016_fullsize_story1.jpg this is gyros : http://prassas-grill.gr/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/%cf%80%ce%af%cf%84%ce%b1-%ce%b3%cf%8d%cf%81%ce%bf%cf%82.png http://www.paratiritis-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/%ce%a0%ce%91%ce%a1%ce%91%ce%a4%ce%97%ce%a1%ce%97%ce%a4%ce%97%ce%a3194.jpg, 
  well yeah . . `` ca n't '' is a bit strong . 
  i 'd prefer not to and i 'll choose alternative travel destinations instead . 
  hope they get over it  nothing to do with being greek . 
  i wanted to visit edirne and istanbul again but ca n't with the current situation :( i hope you get over your current phase . 
  oops, 
  and in a year england joins as well . 
  there . 
  full circlejerk, 
  march 25 1821 : greek independence from the ottomans : https://www.britannica.com/topic/greek-independence-day, 
  well apparently some people got insulted by what he said if you can see the reactions from southern people . 
  he messed up the diplomacy part .
