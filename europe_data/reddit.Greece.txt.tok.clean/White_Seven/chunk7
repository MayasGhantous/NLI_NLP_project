  utter nonsense , there was no exodus whatsoever , or genocide . 
  you guys are masters of revisionism . 
  i envy you catholics some times . 
   what feels so idiotic about trump ? 
  political discourse in the us is a joke , trump feels more like a superstar demagogue , than a politician . 
  what does this article from may , which i am not able to read by the way , prove ? 
  also nice personal attack , i can tell you 're getting irritated . 
  says who , some random dane on the internet ? 
  do n't make me laugh with your empty threats . 
  we will not turn our islands to calais jungles , 30 percent of our gdp is from tourism . 
  kos island has 33.000 inhabitants and were arriving 1000 immigrants per day there in october . 
  think before you comment . 
  what a rude and ignorant comment . 
  thats a false equivalency man , what do altays do better than leopards 2a7 ? 
  thats radio arvila , even the old m60 are operational at a rate of ~ 80 % . 
  they have some little problems mainly with batteries . 
  tanks are perfect when used defensively for a mountainous country like greece , what are you talking about . 
  they invaded because cyprus was this close to holding a referendum to join greece . 
  i read somewhere that its cheaper to buy leopards for turkey , than develop and build those new altays . 
  no one is trolling , but if you want to pretend you have nothing to say to me and act superior , be that way . 
  turks dont even need people , they tried claiming a couple of god forsaken rocks were theirs back in 92 . 
  of course nato backed them up . 
  ok lets stop ignoring the elephant in the room , turkey has been going full authoritarian for at least 2 years now , even the last idiot could see it . 
  what did turks do ? 
  49 % of them voted for erdogan . 
  we stopped , you did not . 
  you still use your influence on our muslim population in thrace , fuck with our airspace , prevent us from having 6 miles of territorial waters with a threat of war , occupy northern cyprus , claim land that is rightfully ours is yours . 
  you have been the shittiest neighbors a country could have the misfortune of having , just because you still think you are an empire . 
  oh now i have to feel bad for turkey , the country that has been our bully for the last 50 years , after democratically electing a power hungry dog in office , the same country that is disputing my hometown as their own . 
  just remember when things were the opposite , what did turkey do ? 
  they invaded cyprus , thats what they did . 
  fuck off we 're full . 
  just say 50 metres man , this is the european part of reddit . 
  its coup season it seems . 
  also mother theresa from albania . 
  no one said slavs genocided the natives , although there would have been for sure some mass exterminations or forced relocations from both sides during wars , those things happened back then . 
  my point is no country is the same as it was 4000 years ago , it does not go just for bulgaria . 
  the original bible is chanted in greek orthodox churches , although a few people ( not even the priests ) understand it all . 
  there was a movement to change the chanting to modern a few years back . 
  yes you are correct , regions retain their names . 
  that `` s why greece offered the names : slavic macedonia and northern macedonia , so that people know that there is not only one macedonia out there and the next time the balkans are bored and go to war we get swarmed by our neighbors . 
  no one is denying the fact that part of fyrom is inside the ancient kingdom of macedonia , we are simply trying to protect ourselves , and our history from being stolen . 
  yes , that 's exactly my point . 
  no country in europe has the same inhabitants , everyone mixed with other people , or was relocated . 
   no , we should stop caring about history total madness . 
  if anything we should care more about history , especially with the recent world events . 
  of course your are not , you are totally descended from great makedonski genes , the same with aleksandr the great . 
  your metaphor makes no sense really . 
  and which country 's inhabitants are the same as those who lived there 4000 years ago ? 
  maybe some tiny island in micronesia , certainly none in europe . 
  well he is right though , british settlers go and built villages , and then named them after their place of origin . 
  [ actually it was the other way around , it was offered by greece but rejected by fyrom and bulgaria . 
  ] ( http://www.novinite.com/articles/140079/bulgaria+says+no+to+macedonia+becoming+'northern+macedonia' ), 
  yogurt having a turkish name does not mean its turkish , microscope is a greek word yet greeks did not invent it . 
  after all we had 400 years of ottoman ocupation , we loaned words from you as you did from us . 
  [ also take a look at this link . 
  you founded nothing , constantinople had a greek population centuries after you guys conquered it . 
  also this rapid expansion and change happened in the last 100 years , not in 1453 . 
  yeah but you 're a grown man , they 're children . 
  the mediterranean diet , considered the best in the world by dietology , has red meat twice a month . 
  yes , olympia . 
  some olympic athletes competed in the [ ancient stadium ] ( http://cache4.asset-cache.net/gc/51186817-manuel-martinez-of-spain-competes-during-the-gettyimages.jpg?v=1&amp;c=iwsasset&amp;k=2&amp;d=ocuj5gvf7ydjqi2xhkc2qnkaaenbj1dcoruv9b5g0jnx3a8nv6htwi68yg5gpd%2fn51nqvoe2wqagdboqqc17fa%3d%3d ) in olympia , the same where achilles and alexander the great competed , in the 2004 olympics . 
  i expect most people with a degree will move out , i know i will . 
  i dont want to stay for many years though , i still love my hometown too much to stay away . 
  \u03a5es , but since greek was lingua franca at the time he spoke some greek too . 
  any latin language is easier . 
  try spanish it has easier pronunciation . 
  ** #bringbackhellenic ** ** #jesusspokegreek **, 
   in the republic of ireland , under the constitution of ireland , both languages have official status , with irish being the national and first official language . 
  northern ireland has no official language , however english is the de facto official language  maltese ( maltese : malti ) is the national language of malta and a co-official language of the country alongside english , the title is somewhat false , english is an official language in some countries but not a national language . 
  isnt our national animal the dolphin since the phoenix is associated with the military junta nowadays ? 
  hitler did not have a majority vote when he was elected . 
  also only idiots make this type of argument , its a false equivalent . 
   i am ashamed to be so . 
  why , your people have spoken and decided , just because you dont agree with the majority does not mean they are idiots . 
  hope this works out for you though . 
  it was the same with our referendum , public polls were actually showing a yes win and no won 60/40 . 
  to be honest britain has to have a wake up call with media and their corruption , i sure know i had one . 
  we did not vote leave or stay , we voted yes or no to a bailout . 
  ofcourse the decision was not respected but still ... 
  that 's not how it works , you cant have referendums ad finem . 
  man , i see you resorting to irony , but the truth is that instabul was bombed twice in a month , and touristy places as well . 
  plus you are in the bad side of the press since even before the russian fighter was downed . 
  i mean you must be getting tons of post in / r/turkey from people worrying , we get tons in / r/greece about the refugees . 
   i admire the way they merged concrete with concrete ftfy, 
  sofia is great , they have a giant whale dick in a formaldehyde tank in the natural history museum . 
  10/10 would go again . 
  to be honest i dont consider it a war , more like a bad prank from bulgaria . 
   olympiacos you 're no brother of mine . 
  yeah serbs are even crazier , at least stabbings are not common here . 
  for some reason i always see a greek flag being waved by serbians though . 
  we diddnt fight on their side in kosovo though . 
  i had the same thoughts when our economy hit the fan , but i understood i was selfish and unpatriotic . 
  and i dont mean this in a natiolist way , i just love my hometown and people . 
  i think it was the phoenix before it was used as the symbol for the military junta . 
  it 's from pericles ' funeral oration in 431 bc . 
  what it means to say is that for illustrious men have the whole earth for their tomb , not only where their headstones and monuments reside in their home country , but also their memories in distant lands , and even more in the hearts and minds of men . 
  yeah its controversial because he received canadian education imo . 
  50 % of your country is inside the balkan peninsula , just like croatia . 
  your cuisine is balkan an mediterranean just like ours and you speak a slavic language like many other countries inside the balkans .
