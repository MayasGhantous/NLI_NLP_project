  ela stin thessaloniki na matheis swsta, 
  i am so ** so ** sorry . 
  where are you from ? 
  what 's that ? 
  ummmmmmmmm `` fun '' is definitely not the word i would use for it . 
  i mean it 's not like i hate all turks or anything . 
  i have friends who are turkish . 
  but it 's definitely not fun and friendly banter . 
  [ football context ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=earmkigjkxk ), 
  hahaha everyone needs more tulumbas in their life . 
  also , if you knew the competition ( particularly in food ) between turks and greeks , you 'd know that it was n't a joke . 
  i need an adult . 
  doner recipes that call for minced or ground meat : http://allrecipes.co.uk/recipe/23670/authentic-turkish-doner-kebab.aspx https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2012/feb/08/how-to-make-a-doner-kebab * there 's even one from wikipedia * https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/cookbook:d%c3%b6ner_kebab notice that i said '' ** in greece ** '' doner is always ground meat . 
  i never made that claim for other places . 
  also i do n't get what point you 're trying to make about how it 's `` turning . '', 
  doner is also on a vertical spit and it rotates , just like gyro . 
  that does n't mean they 're the same thing . 
  because they are n't , at least in greece . 
  but what if it 's stinky, 
  interesting . 
  i did n't know that they did it the right way in germany . 
  i also have never been to turkey , so i do n't know how it 's characterized . 
  in greece , `` doner '' is only ground meat , because layered slabs of meat is our `` gyro . '', 
  in the usa , where i 've spent several years , the only `` gyro '' you see is what we call `` doner '' in greece , which is a cone of ground meat . 
  this is due to some fda regulations that prohibit distribution of gyro cones comprised of layered slabs ( the correct way ) . 
  i believe that it was determined that bacteria could form between the layers if not maintained well . 
  there are indeed places that do it this way , but it 's time-consuming and not the norm to the standard american . 
  in greece , our gyros are shredded , usually pork , and we put fries , ketchup , mustard , tomato and onion in ours ( at least in thessaloniki where i 'm from , those floroi athenians use tzatziki or htipiti in theirs , but whatever ) . 
  as far as the schwarma mistake is concerned , i said in my comment that i could be wrong ( and to your smug point about the raki , we have raki in greece , it 's called tsikoudia and is common in crete , cheeky bastard ) . 
  so , as far as which is whose specialty , it 's really difficult to parse out greek vs. turkish as greece was under ottoman occupation for several centuries . 
  it 's misleading to try and separate them as oftentimes they can not be . 
  we also have `` doner '' in greece , and it is named as such . 
  it is not the same thing as `` gyro . '', 
  i understand that they seem `` close enough , '' but to me ( and i think to any turk/greek ) they are very different . 
  if the only definition is  a big pile of slices of meat that 's is cooked along its height while the piece rotate slowly then yes , they are the same thing . 
  but this ignores the different types of meat ( doner is usually a mix , gyro is one type of meat ) that may be used and the difference in preparation ( one solid cone of ground meat vs. several layers stacked on top of each other ) , which both have a material effect on taste and flavor . 
  where are we going ? 
  hmmmmm cool !, 
  i never took ancient greek , so that would explain my lack of knowledge . 
  you would think that . 
  perceived turkish culinary superiority is one of the most ubiquitous and prevalent parts of my interactions with turks . 
  i 've had my turkish friends prepare their versions of our shared culinary traditions for me , everything from giaourtlou kebab to imam bayildi to baklava , and i would still take the greek preparation 99/100 . 
  regardless , i would n't be so presumptuous as to assume that this is universal . 
  i think context is important . 
  in greece , doner is * always * ground meat . 
  i ca n't speak for other cultures , but if the cone is comprised of layers of sliced meat , then it gyro , not doner . 
  having done some brief research , it actually seems as though every definition of `` doner '' is ground meat . 
  not sure where you 're from , so it 's likely there 's a regional difference, 
  agreed . 
  it can be super confusing . 
  it 's kinda on of those things that you either know intimately or you do n't . 
  guy roe ? 
  what 's that ? 
  that 's just like your opinion , man, 
  is that you ? 
  i did n't expect you to reddit, 
  anymore ? 
  i do n't believe there was ever a guttural `` g '' sound in our language unless you put to gammas together next to each other . 
  this is not the only difference . 
  doner is usually a ground meat mixture that is formed into a cone and cut into long thin strips . 
  proper gyro is several layers of one type of meat ( lamb , pork , or chicken ) that comes as small shredded pieces when shaved off the cone . 
  dough nair ? 
  what 's that ? 
  sitting in a windowless office while reading this comment caused a single tear to roll down my cheek , last of the mohecans style . 
  my mother and sister are in greece right now living it up , and i 'm stuck trying to figure out if i can make 2 underwear last for 4 days while i 'm on the road, 
  this is misleading . 
  but i understand the response . 
  doner * is not * gyro as we have it in greece . 
  doner is ground meat ( usually a blend of the three that were correctly mentioned above ) that has been shaped into a cone and then is shaved from the vertical spit in [ long thin strips ] ( https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f9786a7bb9d26e4d5c391ac3ee98fece ) . 
  proper gyro , as it is prepared in greece , is usually only 1 type of meat and is placed onto the vertical spit in layers , [ as shown here ] ( https://petrabistro.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/gyros_c5878-1.jpg ) , and when it is shaved it comes off in flakes rather than the long strips characterized by `` doner . '', 
  now , it 's important to note that this is common in many cultures . 
  i 'm describing how we in greece differentiate . 
  in greece , doner is not the norm , but is considered a specialty . 
  in the usa , doner is the most common form of `` gyro '' and traditional gyro is not common . 
  in turkey , i believe that shwarma is our `` gyro '' and doner is still doner , but i could be wrong about that . 
  that cums later , 
  is there any other way , really ? 
  well yeah ... but no one has to know that, 
  that could happen , or they could just continue to blame the politicians and never take any responsibility for their actions and just continue on this way . 
  it 's a crossroads here . 
  so what you 're getting at here is that greece is a `` third world country ? '', 
  first off , it 's developing nation , third world country is an outdated term . 
  second , by definition greece is not a developing nation because they have a consistent form of government , social welfare , and belong to the eu . 
  just because you stated 3 correlations between greek culture and your personal experience with developing nations does n't make it a valid claim . 
  fair enough, 
  yeah this is an interesting ( albeit old ) article . 
  really saying the same thing i 'm saying except he puts way more blame on the greek people , which probably has something to do with me being greek myself . 
  i mean , this is so deep and so complicated ... 
  i do n't know if we 'll ever recover and it scares the living shit out of me . 
  i will not disagree with you . 
  the difference , however , is that i 'm describing something deep within the greek culture and psyche . 
  something that i think only greeks can understand . 
  it 's the mindset that , no one helps me so why should i help them . 
  i need to help myself . 
  it 's a masculine trait that i see in greeks that is so dominant in our culture . 
  it 's the same reason why when we got this money after the currency change , we went and blew it all on luxury goods . 
  it 's a problem with the greek way of thinking to begin with . 
  well , it all started when greece first entered the euro . 
  there was a huge influx of foreign investment as a result of increased freedom in trade , which is the majority of the greek economy . 
  the greek economy soars and people start buying things .
