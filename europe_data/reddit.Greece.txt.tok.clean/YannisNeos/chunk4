  opap , one of the only public companies that made any money was privatised in what is known as the biggest privatisation of greece : http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/fdec445c-0378-11e3-980a-00144feab7de.html#axzz3deycjjyg olympic ariways were also privatised, 
  i do n't think we even need to ask such a question, 
  because the cities where macedonia as a kingdom started are all in modern greece and spoke greek and every scholar agrees that macedonia formed part of the hellenistic greece . 
  why are you getting so sensitive ? 
  of all the things irish , food is the one thing you ca n't wait to experience ? 
  do n't want to start a flame war but superpose this map with a religious map and you would get a similar image . 
  some countries have serious newspapers as their most popular , some have the sun . 
  [ in the butt ?

  ok , i now have you as `` breast-pump fetish guy '', 
  agreed , but if you follow what is happening in greece right now you will realise that syriza looks like a bunch of high school kids who ended up running a country . 
  just this morning our deputy finance minister announced that they are missing 400million euros . 
  literally less than 2 hours later the same person comes on air and says that they have been found . 
  this is just a small example of the level of incompetence this party has shown . 
  i really want to believe in syriza but they make it really hard to believe in them . 
  and greeks, 
  syriza is not the beginning of democracy in greece . 
  and syriza is not a magician that will make everything right again . 
  promises have been made by many many governments in the past . 
  excuse my total lack of knowledge but when did turks get systematically massacred in crete ? 
  in peloponese , yes but in crete ?? 
  as far as i know the greeks were the ones massacred in crete by turks . 
  hahaha ... :(, 
  on the other hand just because you are born there does n't mean you will be a better citizen . 
  exactly !, 
  ouch ... 
  this is pretty good :d, 
  hence why a eu army is needed . 
  that 's all i am saying . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imia/kardak#the_military_crisis turkey and greece sent warships . 
  in greek waters . 
  so how did turkey not send ships ? 
  finally `` the european union backed the greek side on the imia islets dispute , and warned turkey to refrain from any military operations against greek sovereignty , and , along with the european parliament , called turkey to solve any disputes it has with greece through the international court of justice '', 
  how is that funny ? 
  in 1996 you sent ships over for a couple of small islands . 
  and turkish ships/planes are always entering greek airspace/water territories . 
  yes the risk of an actual invasion is very small but it 's not as if turkey is the most peaceful country in the world . 
  yes , they are n't going to do anything that 's why they invaded cyprus in [ 1974 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_invasion_of_cyprus ) and that 's why greece and turkey had a major military crisis over some greek islands in [ 1996 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imia/kardak ) . 
  and there is certainly no problems from [ turkey sending ships in greek and cypriot waters looking for oil . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/10/oil-gas-reserves-cyprus-greece-turkey ), 
  well it 's easy for portugal to say that . 
  the biggest threat you have is spain declaring they have better ham than you . 
  meanwhile the rest of europe has russia and turkey to think about . 
  you are right they should have been labeled `` german hosts '', 
   that comedian will leave germany !, 
  errr ... where will he go ? 
  yes ... because of the beat ... exactly, 
  if she didnd ' t give the go ahead she would be totally within the law . 
  for the same reason that insulting a foreign head of state is ludicrous then so does the cancelor having the right to decide if it goes ahead or not . 
  but they both are legal . 
  only trade sanctions would have any meaning but that would hurt both turkey and the eu . 
  pretending it has been solved is being stupid . 
  everyone knows its the same crisis that never really left . 
  nobody said anything about per capita . 
  that 's the point really . 
  kongo is a country of more than 80 million and is only a fraction of poland . 
  nobody expects the spanish inquisition . 
  i agree but the imf should participate and they will never ever accept to get a cut on their share of the money . 
  i am just saying that proposing a cut on german money is bad because when germany refuses they look like the bad guys . 
  imf is such a hypocrite . 
  they preach debt relief but not on imf money . 
  either you preach debt relief and you participate in it or shut the fuck up and find another solution . 
  lol, 
  ok , misleading then, 
  this whole post is wrong . 
  the greek one is regional . 
  this one in particular is from creta which is different from macedonia which in turn is very different from epirus etc. 
  the eruption of the volcano around the mid-second millennium bc was one of the most devastating in the global recorded history and was a catalyst to the downfall of the minoan civilization ( falling ash , tsunami ... ), 
  it 's not an exaggeration since it is a transcript of a discussion . 
  it 's easy to call debt relief on other people 's money . 
  the imf does n't even want to think about not getting their money back . 
  this is what i could find https://www.google.pl/search?q=water+sealed+butter&amp;client=tablet-android-samsung&amp;prmd=ivsn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj0i5xjitzlahvkjxikhqm5cfmq_auibygb#imgrc=jzx2m3gag1mzrm%3a, 
  are you kidding ? 
  no women were killed ? 
  just look at the movie zorbas . 
  under which rock are you living ? 
  ... what 's the difference ? 
  if a woman would defile the honor of a family ( she was not a virgin for example ) she would be killed . 
  the greek comments in the video not in youtube, 
  honest question but do jews in europe really feel so oppressed ? 
  maybe i live in a special place but i never ever saw anyone be prejudiced against jews . 
  at least not more or less than different christian religions , muslims ... are things really that bad ? 
  honor killing used to happen a lot in greece as well yes , many many decades ago but still . 
  the comments in the video gave me cancer, 
  nobody claims that julius caesar was actually albanian ... 
  that 's where greece is going . 
  aiming to get momentum by being left behind ... . 
  turkey is supposed to cooperate, 
  indeed , thousands of people are ferried around greek islands every year so in theory it is possible, 
  give it time , we ought to break down any minute now, 
  that 's bullshit . 
  they were not cleansing the turks as you imply . 
  those murders happened after the invasion . 
  august 1974 was one month after the invasion . 
  i also hope you realise that both sides lost a lot of lives . 
  and if you want simple statistics more greek cypriots died than turkish . 
  so no , that is not the reason why turkey `` intervened '', 
  i think they want us to just let them all drown . 
  that way we are the bad guys but at least they do n't have to actually do anything about the problem .
