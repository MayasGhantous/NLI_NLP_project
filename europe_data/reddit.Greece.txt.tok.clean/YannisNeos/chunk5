  lol never heard that before . 
  interesting , 
  exactly . 
  how does this compare to belgium for example, 
  the guy in the front staring at the camera looks guilty, 
  germany needs time to build up military, 
  you really ca n't compare greece with russia on anything except maybe the religion . 
  russia has natural resources and a big industry . 
  greece has not much really . 
  you mean `` even stronger economic growth '' because every single decision taken the last 2 years only makes russia stronger, 
  [ estonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_attack_on_estonian_defence_ministry ) [ finland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/myyrmanni_bombing ) [ latvia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_department_store_%22centrs%22_bombing ) does that mean that those countries are dangerous ? 
  of course not . 
  really ? 
  is there any doubt ? 
  i mean she keeps a lower profile thant her dad but still http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11943110/marine-le-pen-stands-trial-for-muslim-street-prayer-outburst.html, 
  i think most people do n't read what they write ... 
  the other street is not so central, 
  so much growth !, 
  it has if the company has business in that country . 
  look at microsoft, 
  like that handicapped kid who by going up the stairs during the famous capitol crawl helped change policies regarding handicaps in the us, 
  russia maybe ? 
  i guess that 's more of an illusion . 
  well it is a party , they get to eat meat , 
  well i guess 1976 was a bit different : ( random video on youtube about driving in paris ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg9veptkz9s, 
  since driving in paris with a car is a nightmare in any case this wo n't be too much of a shock . 
  the us would n't be part of it ? 
  since nato pretty much follows wherever the us goes ... 
  ps : only if you keep your expenses uchanged, 
  and tons of bread, 
  unless you believe that people can change, 
  because what greece needs is escalating aggression, 
  i 'm confused, 
  `` welcome to your future '' what ? 
  except that db is a giant compared to lehman brothers and also they are a commercial bank on top . 
  there is a huge chance that they will be bailed out, 
  not in greek . 
  that 's how we call it here, 
  blast from the past . 
  that 's the main point . 
  yes you can suppose that some companies will start relocating by anticipating the brexit but there is so much uncertainty that it wo n't have a real effect for now . 
  at least not until the brexit is actually started . 
  can you give an example ? 
  would n't that make burka wearing women also invisible ? 
  200m deep . 
  pretty sure it will cover the whole border, 
  many of the fallen building looked really in bad shape in the before photos . 
  look at arquata del tronto where only the shittiest building collapsed . 
  it is really criminal to have built so badly . 
  yeah , spread dem fault lines babe, 
  slow day in the news, 
  indeed , personally i am not blaming the croatian company . 
  there should be more electric car companies . 
  it 's more about the comparison . 
  i am pretty sure that tesla company could build a similarly fast car ( or faster ) if bent on it . 
  but tesla aims on distributing sedans and not hypercars . 
  it 's a strange comparison . 
  * some of the islands of greece, 
  * some of the islands of greece, 
  yup , saw them while driving through south poland, 
  i am currently learning polish . 
  learning german was a piece of cake in retrospect . 
  if one can ban nudism because it offends people then i do n't see the problem in banning burkinis, 
  if eu was one country than we would be sending one athlete per event , unlike the 28 we do now, 
  yes but you can buy golden umbrellas with all the money you will earn, 
  you become 5y old bones, 
  i know right ? 
  greece 's pensioners have had huge cuts . 
  i know because every pensioner i meet tells me the same . 
  my dad has already had a 45 % cut . 
  and it will still go down, 
  yes , you are correct . 
  imagine they through a piece of paper with tic-tac-to as a game matching your importance ... 
  spike 69 was a classmate of mine , 
  you are right , it 's norwegians, 
   it 's really just a shed it 's actually a toilet, 
  `` buzzing of flies intensifies '', 
  they will nominate a scapegoat and feed him/her to the lions, 
  i combined your comment with the one above and read it as '' also runs on green energy ... and bacalhau '', 
  except that teenagers are exposed to those ads , not only adults, 
  no , being good-looking is also about genetics . 
  look around you , there 's plenty of thin people that do n't look like her . 
  but i can bet you that even thin girl still want to look thinner to look like a model . 
  hahaha i understand it and i kind of agree . 
  but in greece people would n't complain unless you do it for 8hours straight , 
  i have had neighbors complain that i can not hammer or drill on sundays in frankfurt so ...

  france and lybia : the closest neighbouring countries, 
  year on year rates, 
  you win this time ... 
  schrodinger 's portugal, 
  it 's because it is very difficult to find more than 4 colours ... quick test : name 4 colours that are not blue . 
  portugal is bipolar ? 
  doing god 's work !, 
  i really want to see a bike roads in the balkans . 
  balkans = 60 % mountains, 
  what ? 
  except about russian winter, 
  lol exactly . 
  as if greece 's main problem right now is paying our debt !!,
