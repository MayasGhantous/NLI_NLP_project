  for those reading , it 's meant to be a joke . 
  cypriot accent is to greek what scottish accent is to english . 
  which means , you ca n't understand any of it . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laskarina_bouboulina i 'm surprised dngrs knows her too !, 
  this series is not meant to be about what is currently going on in a country . 
  that 's why it 's titled `` what do you know about x ? '', 
  instead of `` what 's the general opinion of what 's going on in x ? 
  so that 's what you know about greece ? 
  i feel sorry for you . 
  ** before taxes **, 
  they are not included in the percentage, 
  correct . 
  damn you cypriots , the only true ones in greece are the car parts which are taken from french . 
  i do n't deny that the church has extreme influence for being a supposedly western country , but what i said is that it 's up to the people to change it . 
  these days i think that people do n't want power taken away from the church . 
  the parades have nothing to do with religion , it 's plain nationalism . 
  de-centralized when comparing it to most of europe , yes . 
  not every plot of land needs to be populated . 
  it 's expensive and pointless . 
  i do n't see why 4 or 4.5 million are bad for athens to have . 
  you 're from the north , of course you hate athens :d the truth is , that 's what modern societies are , centralized . 
  in fact , greece is probably one of the most de-centralized countries of europe . 
  so many villages and towns . 
  * i like big cities and i can not lie . 
  * concerning the church , it 's up to the people to act accordingly to its needs or not . 
  the church can say whatever it wants , it 's the followers that have to stop being sheep . 
  athens is north to me  the southern you go , the more conservative they get ( excluding the islands ) . 
  the church has played its part in racism , yes , but it 's mainly their failure to act and disassociate themselves from gd that strengthens these attitudes . 
  most followers of gd are strong believers . 
  it 's already true for much of the greek population , i can tell you that . 
  being lazy . 
  dondurma fixed :d, 
  anywhere from one day to a week . 
  but when it 's for 1-3 days it 's usually because i 'm switching between countries ( e.g. 
  austria/hungary/czech rep. ) . 
  the longest was 10 days , in the uk ( that was n't entirely a holiday though , more like an `` educational '' trip ) . 
  the general consensus for trips abroad was about one week , and it would usually be in pairs , such as vienna/prague/budapest , montenegro/croatia/slovenia / serbia , etc. 
  of course that was before the crisis , where some people actually did go on holidays , and even dared to go abroad ... 
  that does n't look like hoverhand to me . 
  more like `` come at me bro '', 
  you can listen to it live @ http://live24.gr/radio/generic.jsp?sid=1334 ( not skai.gr ) o , ti na ` nai is on right now !, 
  why not ? 
  i dislike the main hosts of skai radio too but voularinos and nikolaou managed to pull off a 2 hour long radio show where i ( and many others ) actually laugh my ass off several times !, 
  it makes my day whatever mood i am in . 
  plus you can listen to the show on demand with no commercials , news breaks etc. 
  do n't miss out !, 
  you should listen to `` oti na ` nai '' , it 's on every weekday at 10 pm at skai radio and it 's miles ahead of ellinofreneia when it comes to satire . 
  ellinofreneia ? 
  more than pizza and pasta ? 
  impossibile !, 
  pokemon . 
  then , the internet !, 
  man i 'm really not familiar with all the clich\u00e9s !, 
  you mean `` lazy corrupted union fat cows '' according to some here ... 
  overbudget nonsense ? 
  i hated it , but admit that every person that stayed home at saturday nights above 35 years old watched it . 
  it was really popular among them . 
  its budget was bloated but the commercials are bound to have been very expensive for such a highly popular show . 
  `` some '' were nice ? 
  i personally watched exantas , mixani tou xronou , alithina senaria , lots of films and documentaries , san simera , reportaz xwris synora . 
  my father watched others , my mother watched others . 
  all of superb quality . 
  in fact , some where internationally recognised through awards : http://www.exandasdocumentaries.com/ you ca n't find anything of similar quality in private tv stations ... btw , i was downvoted for saying ert produced superb content . 
  probably by idiots who do n't have a clue about ert . 
  they do n't . 
  their funding is not part of the state budget . 
  for uat2d , if you 're not selling everything , you 're a socialist . 
  til all eu countries are authoritarian regimes . 
  it obviously does n't , and it does n't need to since the population is quite small . 
  the real question is , what would the germans ' reaction be if it shut down tomorrow just because merkel wanted to , bypassing the parliament as well . 
  well of course they do . 
  because over a billion people know english , and less that twenty million know greek - . -, 
  ert had a shitload of local radio channels , 3 main tv channels and an hd channel ( the only one in greece ) . 
  the ratings are low only because greeks prefer to watch turkish soap operas instead of quality programmes ... also the terrain of greece is extremely anomalous , and ert 's signals have to reach every single citizen by law , so there are many expenses in that area . 
  ert had a very , very large open online archive as well as quality webtv . 
  well i 'm greek and i do n't think shutting down everything is the solution , so maybe i deserve the downvotes . 
  ert produced superb content too . 
  please take a moment and read the damn post . 
  you 'll wake up one day and you 'll realise you live in an authoritarian state . 
  wake up now so that this can be avoided . 
  even if you think ert should be shut down , and all the quality programs in the greek tv with it , even then , you should be outraged that only a part of the government can decide in an instant to close any service , bypassing parliament and any other democratic institution . 
  this is authoritarian . 
  not liberal , not conservative liberal , not communist , not socialist , simply authoritarian . 
  you either realise that and you choose not to care , or you do n't realise it in which case i am truly sorry . 
  nobody , ** nobody ** , * nobody * supports that ert should n't be reformed and shrunk . 
  not even ert employees themselves . 
  but shutting it down in one day is simply authoritarian . 
  is it a lie that some journalists who dared to speak some sense were fired by the executive manager put into his place by the same government that shut ert down ? 
  how do you expect the other journalists to risk their job in times of such a crisis ? 
  of course they wo n't try to bite the hand that feeds them . 
  it 's not objective that they were broadcasting government propaganda . 
  believe me , the schedule of ert 's broadcasts was anything but close to the goverment 's beliefs . 
  greece is beautiful , but its residents mostly suck and are unappreciative of what they have , nor do they realise their fellow man 's needs , nor are they tolerant towards him . 
  i 'm going to miss ert and the superb quality of its programs which becomes apparent when comparing with the private stations . 
  you should also realise that the `` holy cows '' were put into their place by the government . 
  the overwhelming majority of workers at ert are not at fault . 
  i said it 's the equivalent ( which means quality public tv & radio broadcasting corporation ) . 
  of course it 's not as good as bbc . 
  no channel is as good as bbc , simply because it 's way ahead of everyone . 
  this is a link by ebu , which is supporting ert even as a pirate station : http://www3.ebu.ch/cms/en/sites/ebu/contents/news/2013/06/monitor-ert-online.html,
