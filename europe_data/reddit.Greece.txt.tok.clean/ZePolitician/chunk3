  you 're getting downvoted because nobody cares when there are n't riots going on . 
  imagine if bbc shut down . 
  what would the reaction of the british be ? 
  because that 's the equivalent for ert . 
  i do n't really know if this is accurate . 
  i know many who have emigrated ( not in germany though ) and none of them have come back . 
  why the hell is this getting downvoted ... 
  they are still transmitting as essentially the journalists have occupied the studios ( they never really left ) . 
  ebu supports them and broadcasts them through this link : http://www3.ebu.ch/cms/en/sites/ebu/contents/news/2013/06/monitor-ert-online.html, 
  riot police outside public radio & tv building in central athens . 
  inside there are only journalists and technicians . 
  the thing is that ert 's bloated costs are not caused by the journalists , cameramen , or reporters . 
  they are caused by the management which has been put into its place by the same government that now shuts ert down . 
  as a greek citizen my opinion is that the greek public tv does a great job , the best among the tv channels . 
  this really saddens me and infuriates me . 
  how do you examine if someone is `` willing '' or `` unwilling '' ? 
  oh god this is / r/cringe material right there !, 
  i 'm not directly against their cause but the video is hilarious . 
  bulgaria/romania are not remotely compareable to greece when it comes to corruption . 
  yet perceived corruption is higher in greece . 
  this study shows nothing . 
  greece is probably among the most corrupted of europe , but this study only presents stereotypes . 
  perception , perception . 
  oh , how objective !, 
  do n't forget mighty * orthodoxy * ... you 've got to be thankful !, 
  yes i am, 
   ^ * kidding *, 
  2 nights ago here it was 34c at midnight so consider yourself lucky , 
  he probably means modern greeks . 
  but modern greeks have a mix of anatolian/european and ** mainly mediterranean ** mindset . 
  eurovision is free advertising . 
  the costs are much less than what we will gain from tourism if the event is hosted here . 
  that 's an assumption and i 'm quite sure it 's wrong because the media love privatizations . 
  it also adds to it that bill gates owns one of the most successful private companies in the world , and therefore knows how business is done . 
  we pay more than that for petrol , and we have 23 % vat on everything plus a bunch of `` emergency taxes '' added in the crisis . 
  ah ... the nostalgia ... 
  sasp777 is greek , just saying , 
  i 've had both ( very ) positive and negative experiences with bulgarians , and only positive with romanians . 
  and i 'm not that sure about the bulgarians . 
  i do believe that it 's the gypsies that present themselves as romanians/bulgarians that actually ruin the image of them . 
  it 's a pity . 
  you 're generalising , fateswarm . 
  british cruise ships come where i live every week and they all damn love it ( and so do we ) . 
  if the title was `` us is trying to promote world peace '' , then yes , you 'd be wrong . 
  if the title was `` racist incidents in the us fell by 50 % in the last decade '' then no , you 'd be right . 
  sometimes , greek mothers send food to their children who are studying away from home by bus ... 
  there are ugly areas , and there are beautiful areas , just like in any city . 
  belgrade struck me off as ugly when i was just passing through the highway but it gets better when you get to the city centre . 
  well , i like it . 
  this guy knows what 's up !, 
  golden dawn is not your usual far-right party . 
  you could have said this in 1930 in germany and recieve the same upvotes !, 
  you 'd be surprised how not different we are from our ancestors . 
  and you eat sandwich instead of pita !, 
  haha do n't forget to bring your passport when travelling to athens !, 
  czech reporting in !, 
  i 'm a blond greek with blue eyes . 
  wan na switch countries ? 
  we 're already there , and these are normal opinions you hear daily ( from left and right equally ) . 
  it 's a pity . 
  i do n't think so . 
  my children ? 
  i 'm not even an adult yet . 
  and no sane person has children at this time . 
  they ca n't afford to sustain themselves . 
  i 'll emigrate anyway . 
  there 's no point in getting humiliated while not making enough for the basics . 
  who knows , maybe i 'll learn german and one day we 'll be coworkers , 
  the thing that you also need to realize is that because of austerity , we spend less . 
  as a result there is a recession and we make less . 
  as a result , we spend less . 
  there is recession , and as a result we make less , etc. 
  whereas in germany the economy is stable , and that is why `` austerity '' seems to work to you . 
  also , please re-read my post and watch the video that i put a link to . 
  and for god 's sake , stop using `` you ca n't keep spending more than you make '' as a thought-terminating cliche . 
  we make less and less each year , there is no point we keep doing that since it leads to us becoming turkmenistan or something . 
  there is simply no point . 
  unfortunately . 
  i do n't completely agree with your views . 
  but i do n't think you 're getting downvoted because of them ... 
  i 'm not giving advice to anyone . 
  for the last 3 years , the cdu is the de facto governing party of eu . 
  things may be going great for germany , but not for the rest of the eu . 
  both my parents work ( this is actually not common ) so i still have an internet connection , food and electricity . 
  ^ ( by the way , i find it ridiculous that i have to apologize for having access to the basic things ) that does n't mean we 're not struggling and it also does n't mean that a big amount of people are struggling and are not sure whether they will have electricity tomorrow . 
  and they * are * struggling through every single day , something that pretty much did n't happen since the occupation . 
  the reality is that if i do not emigrate after i finish my studies , if i am lucky enough to find a job ( remember that 60 % youth unemployment ? ), 
  i will work almost twice as a german would for mcuh less than half the money he 'd get . 
  i do n't want `` more aid '' . 
  nowhere did i say so . 
  i want a general direction change in the eu , from extreme austerity ( which leads to extreme recession ) to a plan that aims to the growth of the economies , and i also want efforts to be focused on eliminating corruption rather than firing everybody . 
  but that will unfortunately not happen until spain goes in deeper shit , france joins the south in the economic crisis , and generally until most of the eu countries feel the crisis . 
  because that is when they 'll pull their heads out of their asses and stop blaming the others , and the others only . 
  let me tell you my opinion on merkel : ** merkel is the best thing that happened to germany in a long time ** . 
  but that 's not the case for the eu . 
  you think that by `` austerity '' , the only thing merkel means is a balanced budget . 
  sure , you may not be rich , but you 're okay , and that 's great if you have the stability that comes with a balanced budget right ? 
  well that 's correct , but when you live here you see or experience shit that makes you change that opinion . 
  because here , merkel 's policies mean 28 % unemployment , extreme taxation of everything , piss poor wages and china-grade working conditions . 
  what happens when the gdp drops so fast and every year you have to drop your standard of living so much to the point where you think you are worth nothing , your studies are worthless and you can not provide a life with dignity to yourself , not to mention your family , if you have one .
