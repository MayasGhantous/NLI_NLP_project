  ( ** and there is no sign of all these ending in the near future ? 
  ** ) that 's when you will realise that merkel 's policies are n't such a great idea for countries in extreme recession . 
  merkel is only going against the public opinion because she wants the best for germany . 
  and the best for germany is to keep giving greece and the other bailed-out countries whatever they need to survive . 
  [ that is the way she considers germany is best off . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ixnslisrs ) also , stop making generalizations . 
  it was 2 people with the nazi attire , not 10 million . 
  it 's not hard for people who do n't think too much to make comparisons with the nazis , only because the situation is reminding us of the occupation more and more , day by day . 
  i bet you that no greek on the planet thinks that most of the fault is n't ours . 
  but just because greece was rotten does n't mean that , if it was n't , there would n't have been a crisis . 
  my opinion , and i believe most greeks ' opinion , is , that it 's our fault for getting in the crisis , but it 's the eu 's fault in general for failing to get out of it , or even begin to see light at the end of the tunnel . 
  greece was corrupted and rotten but that is no excuse to blame her for everything that has gone wrong . 
  the massive failure of the so called `` memorandum '' ( read : the agreement between greece and eu-imf that was made as a requirement for the loans ) is mainly on the troika 's part . 
  greece had no choice anyway but to agree , because the alternative ~ ~ was worse ~ ~ seemed much , much worse at the time and the greeks had the intention to end this corruption bs and make greece a serious country . 
  ( they soon discovered that the eu did not have the same intentions , or even if they did , they failed massively at showing it in practice ) . 
  that still does n't * not * make the eu partly responsible . 
  you did n't even reply to him . 
  you only downplayed his opinion because he 's greek ? 
  if that is n't de facto racist then i do n't know what is . 
  not to mention the generalization : naurgul only stated his opinion and you translated that as `` germany , the well-oiled economic powerhouse of europe , has to take economic advice from greece , which is one missed german check away from collapse and starvation '' . 
  when in fact , it 's the greek government has been doing exactly what schauble tells them for the last 3 years and i can tell you with certainty that we 're pretty damn close to collapse and starvation . 
  of course , the new servants will be paid around 650-700 euros . 
  they 'll be more productive anyway , but it definitely goes to show the decrease in the quality of life and the deterioration of the job market 's situation . 
  very nice post . 
  the transportation/infrastructure percentage is indeed higher than it should have been , there have been many dodgy deals between the government/construction companies . 
  but one should also take into account that continental greece is full of mountains , and we have a shitload of islands , small and big , so it is only natural that the transportation budget will be higher than e.g. 
  netherlands . 
  i 'm not too sure on the validity of the chart . 
  they * hope * for a * slow * recovery * next year * . 
  just as they hoped in 2010 for 2011 , 2011 for 2012 etc. 
  i do n't know about spain , but here unemployment is definitely around 30 % ( official figures are 27,2 % ) . 
  you can see it around you . 
  and out of the employed ones , probably 1 out of 3 work part-time . 
  part-time jobs increased 1200 % during the last 2 years . 
  and they 're getting payed about 300 euros or even less in many cases . 
  that is the sad truth . 
  they are indeed unsustainable and if the situation is n't reversed , i do n't want to think about what 's ahead of us . 
  less than those who work part-time a few hours a week and are considered employed . 
  i do not deny the greeks ' responsibility , there is no excuse for not taking the necessary measures over the last 30 years or so . 
  i did n't say that . 
  frankly the public sector is actually smaller than the eu average . 
  the ones who should be fired are the non-productive/corrupted employees that got in the public sector through connections . 
  i did n't say they should n't be fired , but all the focus should n't be on them . 
  corruption and bureaucracy are n't solved with lay-offs and cuts . 
  that 's what i 'd want the politicians ( greeks and the rest of europeans alike ) to understand . 
  that 's the best you can do ? 
  if you have to say something , at least say something about the article . 
  and you should also wonder why everybody in europe seems to pressure for more cuts and firing of civil servants , instead of calling for elimination of the bureaucracy and corruption . 
  these are the real reforms that should have taken place a long time ago . 
  it 's actually 59.3 % in greece [ link ] ( http://www.statistics.gr/portal/page/portal/esye/bucket/a0101/pressreleases/a0101_sjo02_dt_mm_01_2013_01_f_en.pdf ), 
  no problem . 
  by the way , i 'm not downvoting you . 
  [ cost of living : athens vs. berlin , both are the capitals and have similar population . 
  ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=greece&amp;country2=germany&amp;city1=athens&amp;city2=berlin ) take into account that in the last 2 years , there have been many `` emergency '' taxations that are also a very heavy burden to people . 
  i do n't have a point . 
  but what everyone seems to ignore is that you simply can not fight corruption or increase productivity while having the cost of living of germany and wages similar to bulgaria ( letting unemployment aside ) . 
  any remotely productive person will immigrate to somewhere where their hard work is rewarded . 
  99 % of greeks agree with the first paragraph , but it says nothing about golden dawn . 
  you should also know that the overwhelming majority ( read : about 99,9 % ) of golden dawn voters are not `` race realists '' or whatever you 're called . 
  they just vote golden dawn because they want them to literally beat up the other politicians , or because they think that the immigrants and the communists are responsible for the crisis and therefore deserve to be expelled/go on an exile island , or because they are obsessed with the military , or any combination of these . 
  but what they all have in common is that they are really , really , really fucking dumb . 
  you should also know that golden dawn , that used to be openly neo-nazi when they started off , are now denying any ties to nazism . 
  not because they are n't nazis , but because every greek has heard his/hers father 's / grandfather 's tales about the german occupation , or even worse - lived it . 
  there are many dumb ones who fall into the trap of believing them . 
  there are also many golden dawn voters of dark skin colour ( greeks are generally white but over the centuries we 've mixed with other races , from europe to the middle east . 
  i 'm probably whiter than you are , but you 'd mistake some - albeit a few - greeks for immigrants ) . 
  not black , but definitely approaching the normal skin colour of an arab . 
  they are the funniest of them all ... 
  i mean , look at their leader . 
  look at him !, 
  go fuck yourself . 
  golden dawn are nothing short of terrorists . 
  because that is what they do . 
  they threaten , they beat up , they murder , and they spit propaganda . 
  europe is full , yes . 
  greece is more than full and frankly i do not really care about the illegal migrants either , we have our own problems , while they have the choice to leave ( i do not support killing them or torturing them though , for god 's sake ) . 
  but golden dawn will not only `` take care '' of immigrants . 
  they 're also going to take care of coffeestew , me , and anyone who believes in basic human rights such as freedom . 
  and in the middle of reforming , there 's that 27 % unemployment . 
  when you reach that , you know you 're on a good track !, 
  i did n't know bulgarian tv was this fucking awesome !, 
  when they 're hot , they 're hot . 
  but that does n't happen too often ... 
  we 're up there with the nordics . 
  good job !, 
  he did n't say `` we have money '' . 
  he said `` there ** is ** money '' . 
  payback for 1968 , when the west did n't help . . 
  we have slightly higher wages than you while having prices that are above most of eurozone 's , along with super crazy ass taxation of everything . 
  gdp per capita may be higher than bosnia in paper but what does it matter if the prices are three times higher ? 
  greece is still admittedly better than bosnia at the moment only because some greeks have still some money left from pre-crisis , while bosnia comes from a period of war and destruction , as is evident on the buildings of mostar , sarajevo etc. 
  the only reason i would possibly find greece 's future brighter than bosnia 's is 1 ) tourism . 
  it 's what keeps us from being totally destroyed and 2 ) the very high skilled young workforce that is now going to waste ( read : immigration ) . 
  the troika does n't seem to give a shit though so maybe these advantages are useless . 
  they have felt it , it 's just not as severe as athens . 
  does n't mean there is n't a financial crisis there , just that there is n't such humiliation ( yet ) . 
  [ here is a video taken right after the incident ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=vkcjnxmu9em ), 
  blablabla living above your means blablabla retire at 40 blablabla, 
  a big no-no , even if they actually do carry guns here . 
  no sane person likes fascists with guns , and this is greece , so police consists of mainly fascists .
