  they either shut their ears , or they simply do n't care . 
  they do n't care that they are racists , neonazis . 
  it sucks , and it 's like being in a live history book about 1930s germany . 
  the fact that we are pretty much at the lowest point of the economic crisis and things will probably begin to get better in the near future . 
  thessaloniki is a very progressive city mainly due to its large student population . 
  it is much hotter ( ~ 29c-35c ) than sf in the summer and much colder ( ~ 0c-10c ) in the winter . 
  still way hotter than most cities mentioned here though ... 
  there are many beaches and places of natural beauty nearby that you wo n't be able to go to them all no matter how much time you 'll spend there . 
  if you can land a job there ( that 's the hardest part ) , then go for it . 
  also prominent in greece ... \u03c1\u03b5\u03cd\u03bc\u03b1 or `` current '' , in english . 
  i agree . 
  it is that there is no sign things will get better that makes this so hard . 
  for the majority of young people with degrees , immigration is the only way out . 
  i mostly agree with you , but in some cases it is hard not to think like that when you have no money to pay for electricity , water , or even food . 
  the cancer is the people that take advantage of this built-up rage and anger to promote themselves . 
  except we do n't do that , the pic says we do . 
  the only true part is about the french , there is a stereotype . 
  which i do not follow and i think nobody does in a serious way . 
  i know , but that joke is so overused to the point of being not only unoriginal , but annoying . 
  i 'd rather die poor than having to listen to that kind of humour ... 
  i thought about that too , but it 's the most sensible position to put austria at . 
  my boundaries are more cultural than they are geographical . 
  well you ca n't be geographically correct when you put greece in west ... 
  our maps are pretty much the same, 
  haha i thought about doing something similar . 
  a `` centre '' for the ex-communist countries that have been doing better :d, 
  the taxes my parents pay go toward my education . 
  the difference is , the ** greek education system sucks ass ** so high school kids go to extra afterschool lessons , that are of course private . 
  me personally , being in the last year of high school , i do 18 hours of extra lessons a week . 
  they cost the average family almost 1000 euros a month . 
  if i was in germany then sure though , i would feel obliged to repay the state for what it has given me . 
  if the state gives me nothing , then i need to repay nothing . 
  i get where you 're coming from and i would have the same opinion as you , if i went to school in germany . 
  half of the normal salary there is double ( if not more ) the normal salary here . 
  the prices are the same . 
  there , hard work pays off . 
  here , you work 14 hours a day and get paid 600 euros , if you are lucky . 
  here , everybody 's calling us lazy despite working like dogs . 
  there , while stereotypes still exist , at least we are working hard , people see that , and we are rewarded , like any human should be , for our work . 
  not to mention how fucking annoying and crippling corruption is at all levels . 
  ( here = greece , there = x european country that people migrate to ) there is absolutely no reason to stay in greece if you are a young person that wants to take a shot at making a career or live with fucking dignity . 
  it is definitely a brain drain and i 'd very much like to be a part of it in a few years when i graduate from uni . 
  there simply is no hope for greece . 
  greece never invested anything on me , instead it tries , everyday , to be a burden to my future . 
  jesus christ , you 've devoted your life to insulting greeks . 
  just look at your post history . 
  these are old ... in greece it 's now 57 % . 
  well , you mostly can sense it in the air . 
  cleaner streets , a better driving attitude , things like that . 
  i get what you 're saying because it 's pretty much exactly the same in greece . 
  maybe not to the extent of portugal but pretty close . 
  it does happen , and i live in greece . 
  do n't you have a facebook ? 
  just look at your timeline . 
  i had been in portugal before the crisis . 
  really , there was no difference in the standard of living . 
  if anything , i was surprised by how much more european portugal ( well , at least lisbon ) seemed than greece . 
  it 's the amount of austerity , which was much smaller than greece , and the actual reforms that made portugal 's plan work . 
  the way i see it , the media are n't turning this into a civil war , `` no '' supporters are , by calling everyone who thinks about voting yes a traitor , a nazi collaborator , a soulless selfish cunt etc. 
  no , it 's not a good start . 
  do n't trust internet polls ** at all ** . 
  this is scaringly similar to [ a beach in southern greece ... ] ( https://greece.terrabook.com/messinia/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/voidokoilia-02.jpg ), 
  that 's immigration . 
  we 're talking about natives . 
  my bad . 
  you 're an idiot , the polytechnic uprising happened the year before the turkish invasion . 
  that was ww2 . 
  as if we wo n't exit the euro at some point anyway ... 
  what the fuck is wrong with you , i 'm not even a leftist . 
  it 's a page on facebook with 48k likes . 
  of course , you should send it to the jungle-report and `` we say no to golden dawn '' pages in facebook too . 
  i had something like this in my mind too but i could n't realize the thought because of the final exams . 
  these kinds of analyses are great because they present facts , with a small margin of error . 
  i 'm sure they 'll be appreciated . 
  plus you get to show that the antifascists , in contrast with the nazis , know their math :d, 
  personally , i 'd be interested , 
  \u03a3\u03c5\u03b3\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 ... any chance of a greek version ? 
  i am disappointed in the number of atheists in r/europe . 
  ( edit : or are the atheists 84 % ? 
  probably . 
  hurray ! ), 
  we 've had 3 in the last 2 years . 
  well that 's one of the few areas greece is better off . . most shops are open until 9pm in summers / 8pm in winters . 
  the earliest . 
  fpo is nothing like golden dawn . 
  they better intervene . 
  fuck the nazis and their supporters . 
  fuck them . 
  the germans truly do not have a sense of humour , 
  even if it was better financially like 4 years ago , the corruption still is there in people 's minds ' and actions . 
  i 've always wanted to move away from here , my mentality is n't greek it seems . 
  yeah , i do n't really care about the beauty when everything around me is corrupted , and anything i put effort in is pointless . 
  i 'd rather work and be treated like a human with fucking dignity than rely on this 100 % corrupt society . 
  plus , if i manage to move abroad after uni , i 'll be visiting in some summers , it 's good for holidays but not much else . 
  the greek cypriots do n't hate the turkish cypriots . 
  the situation is much more complex as turkish settlers are involved and heavily distort the proportions . 
  it 's an interesting but complex topic , but the referendum option was essentially a sell-out . 
  no , you 're just in finland ... 
  he will , whether he wants it or not , in a few years , unfortunately . 
  that 's the exception though .
