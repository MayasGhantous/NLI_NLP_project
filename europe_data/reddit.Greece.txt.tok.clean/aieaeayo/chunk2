  your scenario is of course also possible . 
  [ page 27 bottom graph : keep the euro even if it means a new mou or go back to an independent drachma : euro : 55.5 % | drachma : 35 % | undecided : 9.5 % ] ( http://www.skai.gr/files/1/panoulisthegreat/skaieconomy_28-30apr15_final.pdf ) [ but syriza 's voters prefer drachma if it means a new mou.page 29 : drachma : 58 % | euro : 34 % | undecided : 8 % ] ( http://www.skai.gr/files/1/panoulisthegreat/skaieconomy_28-30apr15_final.pdf ), 
  memorandum of understanding , essentially the agreement to implement privatizations , welfare/wage/pension cuts , achieve primary surpluses and accept foreign monitoring in order to get the low interest rate bonds . 
  i do n't know . 
  total speculation : tsipras convinces the party to accept and implement harsh policies until podemos ascend to power . 
  to get a better grasp of what is going on , you have to understand what happens inside syriza . 
  tsipras belongs to the center of syriza ( where varoufakis also stands ) . 
  he wants the euro but he also wants more social expenditure , at the same time he is reluctant to raise taxes for the middle class . 
  he only really agrees with the mou when it comes to fighting tax evasion and corruption . 
  and then there is lapavitsas and lafazanis to the left of syriza , a smaller but influential percentage constantly calling to ditch the euro if the eu forces privatizations , or if the eu demands public sector and pension cuts . 
  for example , they openly disagreed with the february 20th agreement , and if they have n't been elected with the `` inside euro '' rhetoric , they would have been far more vocal . 
  tldr syriza is `` divided '' between those that oppose the mou policies ( mostly as socialdemocrats ) and those that strongly oppose the mou policies ( mostly as old school communists ) . 
  now tsipras has the impossible task to convince both the eu and his party . 
  ( or as some people said blame the eu and leave the euro , but this is a nightmare . 
  if we leave the euro it will be probably consensual . ), 
  well that needs a new tldr tldr tldr syriza wants money for investment and no money for mou . 
  eu is waiting us out until syriza bleeds dry . 
  syriza is waiting eu to compromise or face graccident . 
  or so i think, 
  and then this http://www.capital.gr/news.asp?id=2261130, 
  if his colleagues eventually got money out of this , it is called revolving door . 
  personal gain is hard to find in such cases . 
  it reads like nd 's `` legal ergo moral '' bs . 
  i 'm still skeptical cause as you know , i think syriza as massive populists rather than national saviors, 
  if the accusations are true , does it matter ? 
  or are we so glad that the previous corrupt parties of nd/pasok have lost power that we turn a blind eye to syriza ? 
  why is that not democracy ? 
  greece is not alone . 
  there are many other democracies in europe clearly opposing the way syriza wants to operate . 
  we are not forced to follow those rules either . 
  we can always go back to our own currency . 
  and while i believe this would be a disaster , hey , we have democracy , and maybe a new drachma could prove me wrong . 
  best part , if we fail again , we will be unable to find scapegoats and hopefully wo n't resort to nationalism ( nazi germans / lazy greeks ) . 
  `` the state would collapse '' does n't equal `` greek are untermenschen '' , it does equal `` social unrest , chaos and medium term tragedy '' . 
   let them make that decision that 's already how things work . 
  even after the fiasco of a referendum greeks supported again tsipras to accept the third mou and the hardcore leftists that wanted the drachma did n't even get the necessary 3 % to enter parliament . 
  drachma in the past had bad reputation for decades because of hyperinflation and gold/foreign currency was used regularly . 
  i 'm with the pole on that . 
  the state would collapse . 
  i on the other hand think that we would look up to argentina as a stellar economy even 10 years after our supposed default . 
  70 % imports 240 % debt to inflated gdp and anti-capitalist sentiment ; sure it would be grand . 
  you underestimate the possible revolution that would happen when rations inevitably would be imposed coupled with overnight decimation of our purchasing power . 
  at least argentina had factories and commodities when they defaulted and still it resulted in chaos , we have literally nothing apart from tourism for our drachma to be supported on . 
  ship owners would demand super low taxes , foreign companies would leave because tsipras ' cabinet would go apeshit against the `` capitalists '' etc. 
  i do n't share your optimism at all, 
  many greeks outside athens love to hate athenians . 
  it 's ok i struggled myself trying to come up with one . 
  if we did default we would have to balance the budget immediately since we would be locked out of the financial markets . 
  since we had 11 % deficit in 2010 this would translate in huge immediate cuts through drachma devaluation and it would spell the same disaster that it would today, 
  actually that gdp figure means literally nothing since it was the deficit spending propping the figure up . 
  a drachma then would have the same consequences , we did n't produce much then , we do n't produce much now . 
  we would have the same consequences back in 2010 . 
  the only difference would be a much bigger blow to the eu which would n't make our situation better anyway . 
  your concerns are valid, 
  or pappas taking control of the media replacing media 's propaganda with the goverment 's one . 
  we could always choose schaeuble 's plan to leave the eurozone with 50 billion euros in hand and tsipras rejected it . 
  truth is syriza in the end understood that noone else would take on our debt in exchange for our vassalization so he chose to stay in the euro . 
  syriza could defy all these but then syriza would have to explain to the greek citizens the reason their drachmas worth nothing and all the bullshit syriza promised . 
   they have been labeled `` obviously racist , xenophobic and anti-muslim '' by the swedish media council ( governmental body ) . 
  government labeling news . 
  that can never go wrong . 
  greece will not return anybody . 
  most immigrants will eventually go back to turkey on their own since there are more opportunities there than greece , plus muslim country . 
  how about germany/sweden cuts benefits and stops advertising `` no upper limits '' so refugees that come in europe solely for the welfare stop coming ? 
  most searched : mercedes [ best selling : toyota ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/2f5yuw/new_updated_brand_of_the_best_selling_car_in_2013/ ) finally something to be proud about . 
  no it 's really easy actually . 
  pasok did the most substantial damage governing all those years . 
  nd comes second , because k.karamanlis increased deficit spending while enlarging the public sector . 
  syriza comes third with the capital controls . 
  actually allowing all syrians to travel to germany and sweden would wipe out smuglers and reduce unnecessary deaths . 
  either this or those countries have to severely reduce benefits and make sure every syrian and other immigrants are aware of that . 
  while there 's no hate there are still territorial disputes and the patrols are going to operate on those . 
   the debt will be in that currency . 
  this is factually wrong the debt is euro denominated . 
  this is europe 's 9/11 . 
  athens is an ugly city and apart from the acropolis and other ancient monuments there are not much to see . 
  it 's vibrant and has its perks but it 's still just a city ( maybe i 'm a bit biased because i live here , you could also ask r/greece ) . 
  greek islands in the summer is where it 's at . 
  imho the ideal way to visit greece is 2 or 3 days in athens sight seeing and then 3 + days to whichever island ( s ) you like . 
  you can also consider vienna , pretty architecture , nice pubs , some mozart dude etc, 
  paging / u/constantineleandros, 
  a ) we ca n't drown them . 
  would you ? 
  b ) please remember that macedonia 's croatia 's serbia 's and austria 's border controls were lifted exactly because merkel signaled that germany would take them . 
  you do understand how incentives work . 
  not a single refugee/immigrant wants to stay in greece , everyone wants to go to germany . 
  merkel is n't fucking stupid , she knew this was going to happen . 
  she acted too slow , that can only mean that she was n't against what happened . 
  that should be obvious to you since merkel instead of pushing for closed borders and disincentivize refugees/immigrants , she [ decided to halt the dublin regulation instead and incentivize thousands of people to cross the aegean . 
  ] ( http://www.asylumineurope.org/news/24-08-2015/germany-halt-dublin-procedures-syrians ) why is merkel responsible ? 
  because germany has enough power projection to demand closed borders . 
  instead she and the rest of the eu decided to criticize orban 's closed borders . 
  wo n't analyze this further . 
  if you believe that merkel 's actions and inactivity did n't play a huge part in germany taking one million undocumented refugees/immigrants , there is not much to debate , is it ? 
  a crucial part is just not there . 
  previous nd government locked up refugees and immigrants for up to 18-months in amygdaleza . 
  this was as inhuman as it gets but it was a huge deterrent . 
  syriza on the other hand has always had open border beliefs and since syriza became government even the minister at the time admitted that it became policy and there 's no vetting anymore and we 're practically letting them disappear ( and obviously go to germany ) . 
  [ source in greek for those that disagree ] ( http://www.iefimerida.gr/news/222001/h-hristodoylopoyloy-xanahtypa-oi-metanastes-den-liazontai-exafanizontai ) at february 2015 amygdaleza 's camp closed and then eidomeni saw huge amounts of refugees/immigrants wanting to cross borders and they eventually opened them up . 
  this created an obvious feedback loop as the article also suggests .
