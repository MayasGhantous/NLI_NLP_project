european values = propaganda catchphrases and bullcrap that go out the window the moment they become the least bit inconvenient, 
  staying in a house with no contact with the outside world other than your satellite internet , such bravery much balls w0w, 
  `` erdogan says he does not respect will not obey top court ruling on arrested journalists '' surprising noone, 
  try the zucchini version when you get a chance, 
  relax people , even a broken clock is right twice a day, 
  the first time some caveman shaman spoke of the spirits some one invented * cough * bullshit * cough *, 
  like i need advice by someone with a 18th century mentality, 
   thanks , but i wo n't be part of it exactly how i feel about national identity  so not made or controlled by humans made yes controlled no . 
  you cant trust people with an ounce of power , most are assholes in waiting the rest are just assholes . 
  how about some global organisation and based on needs instead of greed and lust for power, 
  if greece and turkey did n't exist they would n't be any national airspace or land claims to argue about, 
  i have zero disagreements with turks greece and turkey on the other hand ... 
  as i understand it most nationalities are a couple of hundred years with a few been as old as four centuries they where invented to lump together various tribes that hated one another under the same ruler ( hence made up bullshit ) they are only important to those that want to control said nationalities . 
  we left our tails behind , we left the caves behind , we left the tribes that forcibly became parts of our nation-states behind , i say time to leave those behind as well all they do is cause trouble at this point, 
  human , everything else is just made up bullshit . 
  europe is a nice little club but unless we figure out a way to get the planet united its just eurasia that is and always has been at war with eastasia , as for european values what do you mean ? 
  other than a price tag in euros there are n't any , unless it suits some agenda at the moment and will be forgotten the moment it served its propaganda purpose, 
  oh my god you guys when i said `` fuck the horses '' i did n't mean ... sigh, 
  what ? 
  when did they leave the 13th century ? 
  take it up with brussels , greece has n't been run by greeks for years ( if ever ) now, 
  sry cant afford to got more important stuff to deal with like finding gausse for the hospitals , you deal with the refugees, 
  you deal with less per month than greece has to deal with every day, 
  oh come on , clinton is so two-faced and corrupt she she could be a greek politician ... still better than trump tho , which is really sad . 
   ** witch ** should serve as good motivation why ? 
  is she sexy or threaten to turn 'em in to newts, 
  stop stealing our pot god damn it !, 
  i mean as in actual time , take the year turn it in to hours and how many of those are spend at work , i would think its at least a third , if one fifth of the hours worked comes to two weeks then the average is a lot less time than i thought edit : what am trying to say is , i think their numbers are of, 
  am surprised at the time worked , it seems too low if that 19 % ( i rounded it to 20 ) is two weeks the full time is ten , it does n't sound right even if you only work 8 hours a day 42-48 weeks a year . 
  so americans work 10 weeks and europeans 8 ? 
  that ... does n't sound terrible , i thought more than half the time or at the very least a third was used up at work, 
  i 'd rather they send ships/planes and personal to help speed up the process, 
  are we sure it was n't the gays ? 
  they are responsible for storms and floods after all, 
  nope , it was ugake of the burukaka, 
  congratz , you 're not racist :p, 
  the native americans would like a word, 
  i vote polish as a giant middle finger to all the racist twats, 
  another greek that understands that the bizantine empire was n't greek, 
  not sure , but i did hear his mother was a hamster, 
  not really every other provider is known to be much ** much ** worst , and it was only 5 euros more than the lowest available from ote, 
  meh , he 's just farting in their general direction, 
  are you getting those 2mb ? 
  cause am paying for 24 and never get more than one, 
  nah they just could n't have `` fresh '' on the box , to have fresh on the box it has to be in the market , a day ? 
  i think after it came out of the cow or something and the company has to take it back after 3 days on the self . 
  not sure how they come up with those numbers , maybe atop a mountain under the shade of trees ? 
  this summer it rarely went below 35c and 29 average in july omfg when ? 
  nah judging by his comments this is personal , his so cheated on him with a greek and apparently its because she/he was in to beastiallity cause we look like apes lol, 
  c'mon dude , i was just pointing out the glaring logic fail in his comment, 
   also north european men are more often better looking . 
  sure they are , that 's why your women come here to get some, 
  true we dont need heating we do need cooling 6 months a year tho, 
  why ? 
  so our honorable members of parliament loot that too ? 
  while what is happening to our country is fucked up giving money to our government would n't help one bit , they 'd just loot it like they always do . 
  no it cant we got ancient wrecks and cities swallowed up by the sea ffs , how is a 20th century cruise ship gon na impress the divers ? 
  and it would n't help even if it brought ** all ** the divers, 
  you do n't need a teacher to go an extra mile or the student to pay attention , the class gives official sanction to the churches bs and kids are impressionable , you turn that class in to religious studies in general not just the `` one true religion '' and its fine, 
  it reinforces the church as `` right '' cause you go to school to learn things and they would n't teach you lies would they ? 
  so yeah i do think the class is a brainwashing tool for the church ... because it is, 
  well , someone brings a cross big enough to get nailed on , they 're asking for it :d, 
  its part of a huge chunk of humanity cant hide from that . 
  better to show them various faiths so they can see other bullshit along side and let them figure it out, 
  i do n't think it should get there either you make it sound as if some countries have gone to far the other way , unless that is if a ** teacher ** brings a cross/wears burka / - insert religious symbol here - . 
  crucifixion sounds harsh even then tbh, 
  err ... are you been deliberately obtuse ? 
  i clearly say there is no need for russia to fund them people already do n't want it and unlike the us the eu still seems to give a fuck about peoples health and not sinking their home, 
  tl : dr church loses brainwashing tool clerics angry in other news tanar ` ri summoning fails as the clerics realise they are n't on faerun and have no spells, 
  fracking also means poisoned water and unstable land that eats your house tho , and in eu there is a habit of giving a fuck about people not just corporate profits, 
  its , getting laid with a [ sand wich ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/f5/9f/90/f59f900ff6f0a812eda8a1b4a4959733.jpg ), 
  is it the young earth kind ? 
  cause the `` god did it science is just finding out the how '' has always been in europe and its not insane or anti-science so personaly i do n't mind, 
  nooooo that was the best typo i 've seen, 
  nah its a phrase meaning keep moving forward `` amola kaloumpa '' roughly unwind more string ( as in for a kite ) koula is a name , amola kaloumpa koula is the chorus of a song from the 80s, 
  i lost all faith in the `` justice '' system the day a.papandreou walked and it has n't surprised me since , billions get stolen but no one is guilty and you are angry with this guy for deleting a few names , not that he 's the finmin of `` lefta yparxopoun '' ... 
  pretty sure he was n't martian, 
   ** cookie salad ** : buttermilk , vanilla pudding , whipped cream , mandarin oranges , fudge shortbread . 
  best name ever, 
  dont be daft , wait for spring at least, 
  schadenfreude is an ugly thing, 
  that 's what mercs are for , plus you assume that the poor will fight for the middle class , pretty sure those days are over , by now they know the middle class cares about their problems as much as the 0.01 %, 
  am curious , considering the middle class does n't give a shit about the poor why should the rich give a shit about the middle class ? 
  nah just patients , hope is fine ... maybe a bit bruised, 
  did n't know that was an option.have a ( up ) vote, 
  you are right , why bother hoping for a better future when you can just give up ? 
  which is why i was willing to give him a chance , he had it and now he is in the same pit as nd and pasok as far as am concerned . 
  what 's the other option ? 
  vote known liars and thieves ? 
  with leventi or some one like that i can at least hope he wont be a cunt, 
  at least he 's been honest so far , so yeah unless something better comes up or he 's been caught lying and bsing like the rest and i have n't heard about it , might as well give him a chance . 
  naaaah lets go with nd or pasok again , we have n't had one of those in ... 2 years ? 
  this time will be different , i promise they wont fuck you up the ass like the last 40 years . 
  lazy ? 
  i 'll have you know the looting was both enthusiastic and vigorus, 
  more likely the foreigners do n't know the streets or know when its time to run, 
  he forgot to mention it would also melt the ice caps , destroy the ozone , and start the black plaque 2.0, 
  7 planets !, 
  its gona have at least one special and one planet with bonus minerals maybe even a research bonus ... 
  am be a spoil sport and remind everyone that you do n't actually live in a democracy you are n't voting for laws you are voting for lords and if yer very lucky they are n't complete cunts .
