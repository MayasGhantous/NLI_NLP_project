  the question is who is the greatest threat to ** world ** peace not who is an asshole or a threat to his neighbors and as americans like to say russia is a regional power not a real threat world wide iran is n't even that much , any country that did n't say the us was answering a different question . 
  and that answer is as true today ( despite russian actions ) as it was then, 
  you actually think getting rid of conquering tyrants that slaughter the natives population = the genocide of said native populations ? 
  did i say anything about a population exchange ? 
  edit : maybe if you can bring back to life the millions you slaughtered . 
  at least in my case that seems to be true, 
  are you retarded ? 
  that is agia sophia its a church its basicly the orthodox vatican that was converted by the turks, 
  nah we 'll just give you the turkish treatment and throw you out or lynch you in the streets ... maybe walk you through a desert without provisions ? 
  yer thinking to small . 
  oh come on man , have n't you ever slipped and fell in some asshole dick first ? 
  oh they where elected , and then browbeaten in to submission or did you miss how they where and still are been treated ? 
  add the fact that a shit ton of former pasok and a few nd members joined it before it got elected , can also point out how weak greece is atm so they would n't have a choice even if they were n't , that enough ? 
   fun fact : the greek politicians are the product of their society , not the other way around . 
  fun fact our politicians where installed by our allies at the end of ww 2 and for the most part where the same families that where put in parliament under otto , we got boomed to have those assholes in charge , they are n't a product of greek society they are the mask of colonialism in greece . 
   have you seen what happened in romania when their goverment tried to screw them ? 
  they got their asses up and did something about it . 
  did you see what happened when greeks where in the streets for months at the start of this ? 
  protests in greece never worked . 
   your goverment and your institutions have been greek for decades now . 
  the only thing that wasnt greek was the money you spend on fantasies . 
  when was that ? 
  cause the people in charge where the same ( or their children ) our `` allies '' put in charge after ww 2 only the king was missing . 
  last ( and only ) time greeks got what they voted for was the referendum to get rid of the king and that was followed by 7 years of junda ( tnx usa ), 
  if you completely ignore history sure , if you do n't you gona find all our governments have been puppets for our owners starting with a bavarian king with a british a french and a russian political party followed by a british king with a french a german and a russian party in all the way to ww2 when we get bombed by our allies to force a british king on us followed by a junda that exterminated anyone our owners deemed a threat after we got a referendum to get rid of the king ... our government and institutions have never been greek . 
  so no greeks are not responsible for the actions of fake governments following orders from our foreign masters hell our current government got voted to do the opposite of what its doing and even ignored a referendum to do so, 
   misunderstood super villains . 
  as in how super they are as villains ? 
  have you even looked through this thread ? 
  half the posters see `` indirect methods may be at work '' ( which means nothing imo ) as proof positive its actually happening . 
  and i find it hilarious, 
  but its perfectly fine to pretend its proof right ? 
  i love this thread , having no evidence for something is unimportant apparently because they could have found some undetectable way of doing it ... i guess they control germany and the rest of the eu already as there is no evidence of that either but it could happen ... 
  this bullshit again ... nato is an alliance it acts as a figure head for the armies of its members if you really want to know the size of nato forces around russia you need to add all the military of nato members around it, 
  get real , most of the eu countries are unimportant and would be almost irrelevant outside the eu, 
  tell the man to relax trump will get him self impeached in the next couple of months the way he 's going . 
   shut themselves off from the press and go along with trumps `` everything is fake news minor correction people thought that before trump , he 's just using it, 
  while we are in the eu we are not the eu, 
  as far as i know greeks would rather see the eu become use than leave it , its the only end game that makes sense anyway we 're just ahead of the rest ... as always :p, 
  any idea why they think \u03b2 was a b \u03b4 was a d etc ? 
  i do n't understand why that would change, 
  all e sounds turned to i we got a ton of e 's all used to be distinct now they all sound the same tho some of the names are a clue as to the sound for example \u03a5 ( \u03a5\u03c8\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd ) means e ... flat i guess ? 
  e.i a straight up e , iota means e as you hear it, 
  waste not want not ? 
  nope there has been no real investigation on the debt . 
  according to the our government back when we where demanding it the troika would n't let us cause of the odious debt thing we where throwing around , according to anyone else cause they would go to jail and loose their stolen wealth, 
  i got no debts not even a credit card , how about you ? 
  hey look at this , something every european seems to agree on throw us out , thanks guys and you 're welcome, 
  both would be manageable , worst case scenario if you lost 20 % of the banking sector would be 2 % of gdp so not the end of the world, 
  lets say london does lose that 20 % how big a deal is that for the uk ? 
  they do n't say what it is compared to gdp so i guess not bad enough to scare anyone, 
  nah we spend that on coffee and 4k 50 '' tvs, 
  it seems to do investigative journalism ( a rare thing these days ) not post crap it found on tweeter/facebook as facts.it may be that they are better at hiding ( or i failed to notice ) it but for me at least they have n't discredited their work with obvious bias and propaganda pieces masquerading as news . 
  dude we 're greeks , we never confuse government and people , in our experience government represent the rich and only the rich not the people and generally think this applies to all other countries as well ( tho the nordics and possibly the swiss seem to have their shit together ) so from our perspective holding a grudge on italians for mussolini 's actions would be insane . 
  oh and tho its uncommon now we still use romnios ( \u03c1\u03c9\u03bc\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 ) ( citizen of the roman empire , citizen of rome been romeos ( \u03c1\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 ) ) even 30 years ago it was quite common . 
  translation : plz do n't recognize kosovo, 
  except not a single greek that saw this thinks its anywhere near accurate , i guess we are all amazing and exceptional like all redditors ... 
  no you do n't you try to stigmatize the ordinary greek , sure you got a couple right i do think turkey is our worst neighbor and we do say una fazza about italians the rest is all you, 
  just a guess , never been to greece or spoken to a greek right ? 
  120 % when this mess started it was 120 %, 
  how dare you sir !, 
  how dare you say the earth doing a lap around the sun means nothing !, 
  '' i intend to withdraw from iraq , invade some real pussies like spain '' - frankie boyle, 
  frankly to me it looks like an ongoing attempt to delegitimize trump to put hillary in the white house after she lost the election , it can only blow up in their face , either the democrats who will lose more voters with these tactics or the usa if they manage to overthrow the president elect . 
  plus she killed the source of the immunity, 
  spy they knew will be replaced by a spy they do n't , but that 's irrelevant . 
  the american gov looks like a bunch of petulant kids throwing tantrums cause they lost the election and russia acts like an adult ignoring the childish crap . 
  point russia . 
  not excusing anything am just pointing out that the constant `` but they let those in when they wherent rdy '' posts by turks to show they are been treated differently than the rest are dishonest or misinformed . 
  btw by the rules of the eu at the time greece was fullfiling every aspect , the same method for calculating the deficit was used by everyone including that trick with goldman that we and germany it self had used . 
  the difference came latter when germany fixed its shit while our cunts continued looting and bullshiting, 
  i do n't know how `` it '' works , i do n't know which parts they were n't fulfilling . 
  what i do know is that turkey is n't fulfilling any while they where mostly ready . 
  am looking for which chapters they where falling when they joined but i cant find 'em atm . 
  those did not meet 1-2 articles turkey is falling in all but one , it was a `` almost there might as well '' , not so with turkey, 
  our attitude to both those countries in my experience is `` they never hurt us so why not be friends '' with russia there is the orthodoxy thing as well, 
  dont laugh we 'll be getting some next week , emi expects snow even at the beach . 
  nah from king otto to prime minister tsipra our government has n't changed a bit, 
  gawd !, 
  how dare they demand some thing marked as news be actual news instead of made up crap and propaganda ... the nerve of these people, 
  no people blame them for doing the same shit as the previous guys like hiring family and friends for big salaries at non-sense posts not going after corruption like they where supposed to which makes everyone think that the only thing that changed was the party that gets the bribes/loots while fucking us over oh and dont even get me started on the multi million tax evaders that still get away with it while some poor schmuck can loose his house for 200 euros, 
  yup, 
  go murder some kids to steal their land, 
  that is actually bollocks , our media is biased and full of spin i do n't trust a word they say that does n't mean i trust russian news any better , i see no real difference between china russia and the usa they all lie , do whatever the fuck they want , ignore international law and call on it as needed for their own benefit and fuck everyone else . 
  hahaha that will be a huuuuge problem for the average brit , how will they survive without it, 
  and yet here we are with everyone calling idiots or worst for finally voting for some one other than the cunts that brought us to this point, 
  our options where syriza golden dawn kke or the cunts that brought us this mess and everyone in europe was saying were n't doing their part , syriza seemed like the lesser evil . 
  that the billion will be spend on the people running the fund , not on investment, 
  the salaries of the execs comes to 995m ? 
  unlawful imprisonment does tend to be called kidnapping - hey a black/jew/greek / nordic/japanese looking guy shoot up a street lets put them all in `` camps '' - sound reasonable to you ? 
  aaaaww you gona ruin his peace loving soft spoken wise man image :'(, 
  bacon is why the converted in the first place , everything else is a bonus, 
  a politician been a hypocrite ? 
  you never see that anywhere !, 
  the country that gave us monty python presents ... ** nigel farage ** in a hilarious never ending sequence of irony and surrealism that ** w ** ill b ** low ** ** your mind **, 
  and yet this is about the eu and its actions , specifically how its handling it with in its borders , try reading instead of skimming, 
  might wana read the article to find out what the thread is about ... 
  when did they join the eu ? 
  ahead of our time again , sinking to the bottom of the sea before its cool, 
  oh great , now he 's definitely going to win the election !,
