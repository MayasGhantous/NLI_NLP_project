and what happens when you have a job with good health insurance , your kid gets a scholarship or cheap in state tuition ( or no kids ) , you own your own house and you do n't drive directly into potholes ? 
  i guess if you contrive disaster scenarios you can make anything sound like a worse option . 
  there 's a reason net france-us migration is in the us 's favor -- not france 's . 
  how come you 're not accounting for the vastly lower salaries ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/median_income us - $ 43,585 france - $ 31,112 $ 12k can buy a lot of ham sandwiches to make up for a voucher card . 
  you realize you can still upload encrypted files right ? 
  you have complete control over what you share with the world . 
  do n't blame dropbox if you choose not to do so . 
  [ so true . 
  european companies like ikea are famous for their large tax contributions !, 
  ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2016/02/14/news/companies/ikea-tax-avoidance-europe/ ), 
  exactly . 
  and the solution is not to build more housing , since supply and demand is a capitalist conspiracy . 
  the solution is more price and regulation controls , as zimbabwe and other similar ultra successful states have shown this is a very sound economic policy . 
   erm freedom of speech laws are awesome in the uk your government tried to ban porn . 
  how awesome , reserved , and balanced is that ? 
   us vs them politics can you imagine a us-style leave vs remain divide happening in the uk ? 
  heavens no !, 
  so true . 
  for example , [ liberal european countries would never try to get isps to ban porn ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23401076 ) . 
  lulz maybe vw should n't have broken the law ? 
  no , there 's no corruption like germany owning vw and then cheating on emission scandals to pump up its export numbers . 
  how dare other people share their experiences !, 
  europeans are knowledgable , worldly , and welcoming , so naturally -- fuck off unless you 're european !, 
  ca n't they be ethical like european governments and just trump up some rape charges against political opponents instead or use some good ol' fashioned polonium ? 
   imagine how much better that money could be spent no one is better known for wise discretionary spending than young people, 
  so `` us-style '' life saving cancer drugs are bad ? 
  what about `` us-style '' medical journals ? 
  are those bad for the general population ? 
  i guess we could import romanian-style things instead . 
  pacemakers powered by horse and cart , no doubt . 
  the only certainty is that no matter the outcome , the uk 's special treatment in the eu is permanently and completely revoked . 
  agreed . 
  short term this will hurt the eu , but if they weather this and the anti-globalist wave throughout europe you could see a much stronger , united europe in 10 years . 
  brexit might end up being the best thing that 's ever happened to the eu . 
  maybe there should be a referendum ... 
  thank god humans ca n't drive under the influence of anything !, 
  is there a thread on / r/europe that does n't reference america ? 
  so you 're treating different eu countries differently ? 
  that 's not very unitarian of you . 
  all eu countries should be treated the same . 
  romania is just as a good and has just as high of living standards as finland !!! 11 !, 
  why do n't finns flock to live in romania if it 's so amazing then ? 
   our chickens ' under heavy regulations which keeps both their meat and eggs free from salmonella which theirs ' not . 
  so , so true http://www.about-salmonella.com/salmonella_incidence/  in 2009 , over 40,000 cases of salmonella ( ** 13.6 cases per 100,000 persons ** ) were reported to the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/salmonella  salmonella is a bacterium that can cause an illness called salmonellosis in humans . 
  in the european union ( eu ) , over 100,000 human cases are reported each year . 
  efsa has estimated that the overall economic burden of human salmonellosis could be as high as eur 3 billion a year . 
  https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/figures/living_en  the eu covers over 4 million km \u00b2 and has 508 million inhabitants 100,000 / 508 million = ** 19.7 per 100,000 persons ** til 19.7 < < < 13.6, 
  [ so uh is enisa a front or what ? 
  ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/european+network+%26+information+security+agency+%22enisa%22/@35.3386639,25.144268,17z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x149a5bd3013abeaf:0x973bbdd55a05b060!2seuropean+network+%26+information+security+agency+%22enisa%22!8m2!3d35.3387352!4d25.1442126!3m4!1s0x149a5bd3013abeaf:0x973bbdd55a05b060!8m2!3d35.3387352!4d25.1442126 ), 
  the tories are about to privatise the nhs and you 're worried about the americans . 
  smh . 
   the uk that said its vital for them nato remains a bastion of freedom and eu should always remain a stable union ? 
  no reason to think about them like about trump . 
   http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/23/mattis-support-nato/96971878/  le pen isnt elected as leader of france . 
  therefore irrelevent . 
  so when trump is n't elected leader , it should also be irrelevant . 
  how long does this sentiment last ? 
  just curious to see how far back you apply the principle to elected european leaders who were less than ... erm ... palatable . 
  i assume you 're also distancing yourself from britain given the results of brexit , right ? 
  you are n't going to forget that ? 
  surely you 're already starting to distance yourself from france given le pen will get a huge percentage of the vote , even if it 's not half . 
  never forget , right ? 
  damn , mexico is gon na be in so much debt, 
  if bernie does n't have power , that cuts out pretty much all of parliament in every european countries . 
  when your list of incredibly far left leaders is topped by people like theresa fucking may , your theory may be invalid, 
  care to cite , with specific examples , how bernie sanders is far to the right of center left ? 
  how many referendums did it take to join the eu ? 
  yeah but no bendy bananas so fuck it, 
  greece is not in the balkans , and regardless of that , last i checked , the balkans are european . 
  so no , not really a different story at all . 
   would look ridiculous in a european country . 
  [ yeah , thankfully the church has zero pull in any european country ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/in-greece-churchs-tangled-ties-with-government-raise-questions/2012/05/30/gjqafysg1u_story.html?utm_term=.5a4e8fc186fa ), 
  like the running of the bulls or foie gras ? 
  luckily those are n't controversial topics in europe at all !, 
  exactly . 
  protestants are an american thing . 
  europe is far too civilised to invent something so backwards and ignorant, 
  good point . 
  to me , ice cream should have meat in it . 
  i would n't mind if all ice cream without meat were forced to be named something else , since we do have a lot of rules on what you can call food items . 
   honestly , to me , sausage is something that 's meatbased well if you think that way , then we should change all the regulations to fit that . 
  anything else we should ban while you 're coming up with ad-hoc definitions off the top of your head ? 
  probably when europe goes in and cleans up africa after all the good charitable work that was done there ? 
  i 'm guessing all that copper , gold , and diamonds wo n't be finding their way back though . 
  funny how the `` banter '' is always downvoted when it 's directed against europeans though and always upvoted when against america . 
   because it 's just an american custom then why are the french and german presidents term limited ? 
  the us is more amazing than europe . 
  not only are there no border crossings , but the currency and language is the same in all those countries , unlike in the schengen area !, 
  so amazing !, 
   it does suggest their peak was two millennia ago , and that is a bad thing . 
  by this logic , spain is the best off of any country since it has the most recent entry , and thus has the most recent `` peak '', 
   the relationship between france and the us should be one of equals as the us literally owes its existence to france i 'm curious as to why this is considered acceptable to say , but when americans say ridiculous things like `` we saved your ass in wwii '' it 's considered rude and boorish ? 
  how about fining them for things like dodging taxes ( ikea ) or destroying the environment ( vw ) , not putting an icon of ie on the desktop . 
  but then again , that would n't extort money from outside the continent . 
  yeah but what do you do with the midget after he 's covered in so much lube ? 
  ah , the motto of russia, 
  exactly . 
  also , alcohol needs to be banned for anyone under 18 eu wide . 
  there are no medical reasons to allow it since it 's quite harmful to developing humans .
