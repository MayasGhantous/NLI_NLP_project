  and yet here is how their polls looks like doctoring as fuck, 
  this is how it looks like in other sites syriza 34,2 % nd 19,6 % potami 6,3 % kke 5.2 % xa 5 % anel 3.7 % pasok 3.2 % centralist 1.8 % kidhso 1.1 % other 3 % unidentified vote 16.9 % http://www.naftemporiki.gr/story/964609/dimoskopisi-probadisma-146-syriza-enanti-nd both are in same days around 11 june `` nationwide poll by marc for the company alpha . '', 
  http://www.avgi.gr/article/5638505/dimoskopisi-tis-public-issue-gia-tin-augi-tis-kuriakis-mprosta-28-o-suriza this is how a syriza pro poll looks like and yes total is 119.5 % edit to clarify something other party 's except syriza have the same numbers in other polls made those days but some how syriza in this poll is rocking 47.5 % but in other polls its close to the numbers they got in elections around 35 % 1-2 more or less so those who are pro syriza and find polls from any other greek company fake or meh or whatever can look at their own and find who 's false, 
  they did n't even have the balls to add kke proposal . 
  and btw we do n't even know clear what the question is . 
  lets say i vote yes what if `` yes '' part haves taxes who will be stupid to vote something that haves taxes on ? 
  and also this is unconstitutional , you cant ask people in referendum if they want taxes says the logic behind that law in our constitution , because they will fucking vote no we do n't want taxes . 
  as i told in other topic he chose to save his party over the people . 
  he chose to hide behind the people because he cant even pass his own bill in the house, 
  as much as i dislike tsipras and his syriza i agree whit him in one thing that troika threated greece whit punishing and humiliating way even those who more easily told yes to whatever asked from troika . 
  the last example is removing the greek finance minister from yesterday eurogroup even if he is a big clown him self he represents greece . 
  hope whatever you want i do n't really care . 
  i get in the offense when someone tells voters clowns witch means the people of country and i proved you how easy it is to do it whit that ( like the clowns who voted for jos\u00e9 s\u00f3crates ) so yea dream on whatever you like . 
  like the clowns who voted for jos\u00e9 s\u00f3crates, 
  first time left, 
  or we go for elections vote those clowns out who mocked every one from greek people to eu people and never find out what will happen if greece declares bankruptcy because none really knows . 
  i know , did they pay `` ekas '' ? 
  my grandma didnt get it, 
  direct democracy is when the people elect representatives to govern and they legislate for the people . 
  btw i dont have the time to play blame games fuck that and fuck those pussys we have as government and when they come to the point to actually govern the county they back up and hide behind the referendum whit the fear that they will loose majority in house if they try to pass the bill them selfs . 
  fiscal referenda are unconstitutionally, 
  direct democracy is for people to vote governments to rule for them and pass judgment on them and not go to the poll when they can not decide on something and no longer have the power to decide as government . 
  they cant ask people yes or no for eu it is unconstitutional and needs 3/5 from the house to change anything about . 
  they try to cheat greek people whit that referendum because they cant make true all the lies they told before elections . 
  like they will eliminating enfia ( its tax for property ) . 
  they will tear understandings . 
  they will abolish all laws of memoranda and more but they did absolutely nothing for 5 months . 
  and when the time come for hard decisions they going for referendum because they are afraid that they will loose the majority if they try to pass anything in house . 
  pussies are those who protect their position and save their ass risking the country 's future . 
  monday will be chaos when pensioners go to the banks, 
  he is the last remain in greek politic scenes who can promise easy solutions and gather big numbers . 
  do you think those 30 % unemployed care much for responsibility those who closed they business due to crisis and now owe thousands euros that know they cant pay back , care much about responsibility . 
  and much more which my bad englando cant describe . . those people are easy to manipulate . 
  tsipras had to do one job finnish the 2 program good or bad as it is but he could not because he was elected with lies and promises whit easy solutions . 
  so he do n't risk to loose the majority in house and does the easy thing pass the decision to people . 
  he is the biggest pussy in history of political changeover, 
  point is the bills must pass whit the votes of the government witch is syriza / anel else government loses its professed and this leads to new elections . 
  potami / nd / pasok can vote to pass the bill but this wont save the government if syriza/anel dont have a majority 151 votes, 
  the referendum is to save his party and his ass because he cant pass in house the deal no mater what , they wont find 151 votes from syriza/anel to pass it and government will loose professed . 
  varoufakis was not a prophet when he said you 'll be with us after the break ? 
  few months ago they knew from start that what they said before the elections can not take place and that would lead to this point .

'' `` if the prime minister attempted to hold a referendum and ask the people of the euro dilemma and measures or outwards , then the collapse of the economy , the bankruptcy of the country will come long before the ballot box . 
  this will not be a referendum would be a risky roll of our country ... '' alexis tsipras 2011, 
  this might look ballsy but its pussy move at the same time because they are going to carry the burden on citizens . 
  he told to greek people we are going for referendum but we say no as government but if greeks vote yes then we will respect that . 
  if he had the balls he will told no himself strait and do n't pass the heavy lifting to the people . 
  for those who do n't know tsipras and his party was blaming g.papandreou in 2011 that they are going to carry the burden on citizens if he go for referendum . 
  and what tripras do now ? 
  he is going to carry the burden on citizens for his failures and the lies he told pre election . 
  i hope eu pro option wins . 
  where those politics are born . . we need one, 
  the best our government can do is to rename troika to institutions and memorandum to agreement . 
  who told that ? 
  what i 'm telling is : its easy to import instead of producing here . 
  and you say dependency like we will die starving if we do n't import and this is stupid . 
  because if you can sell you can import whetever the hell you want . 
  greece is not isolated communist country ( yet lel ) you can import and sell w/e ppl are buy and wont make you stupid but rich . 
  so we import from them we no stoopid, 
  its easy to say what is stupid if you do n't know how things are . 
  banks are dead from 2008 and free market whit them . 
  none invest in anything everyone hides his money because they do n't know what the fuck will happen in the end . 
  this comes to how stupid things are here in greece you cant invest in anything its not safe . 
  you cant risk your money its safer to import instead of produce here . 
  but if there 's a market why not to import anything even if its food ? 
  is that stupid ? 
  so its stupid to import ? 
  or greece is stupid to import ? 
  food or whetever else, 
  the problem is he promised everything but the best he will do is a new bailout program and name it `` memorandum not '' so those who voted him to rip off the memorandums wont feel stupid . 
  the plan of the previous government was to successful end the second program and slowly start getting money from markets whit the help of eu if the interest was to high . 
  what syriza needs to do is to stop bullshit greeks and start speak the truth . 
  i wander what the 47 page program ( not memorandum ofc ) of syriza haves and why they avoided to bring it yesterday for discussion in house . 
  and i wan na see if they will have the ppl to vote and pass it in house . 
  and the name comes from byzas or byzantas ' \u0392\u03cd\u03b6\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ae \u0392\u03cd\u03b6\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 ' \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0392\u03cd\u03b6\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 etc myths or true story that became myth its the same thing greeks used this guys name for that city . 
  we reformed now and everything works fine the bribes are all stopped . 
  you cant bribe if you dont have money . 
  byzantio was the name of the city in ancient greece named after byzas , the leader of the megarean colonists and founder of the city . 
  no christians called the city constantinoupoli or poli from \u03a0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7 = city . 
  the old greek name of that place was byzantium and was named like that around 700 years before constantine the great was born . 
  it was free win anyway say w/e you like 1100 years of an empire, 
  russian tryed few times and failed to take the city . 
  exactly what i m say he didnt want to use the old names witch was byzantium in ancient greek and constantinople after , he give the city new name witch is like 80 ~ years old and the city haves history like 2500 ~ years . 
  he didnt use the old names thats all . 
  there was around 14 emperors of byzantium and the first one whit the name constantine ofc he didnt want to keep that name . 
  so how greeks conquered the roman empire for free is what i call easy win . 
  he didnt want the reference from byzantium empire, 
  my mistake not ottomans and muslims but the new turks didnt want to use the old name . 
  well my mistake not muslims but the new turks didnt want to use the old name of the city to avoid any christian reference . 
  byzantium was the name of the city in ancient greece and when the constantine the great changed the capital of roman empire to byzantium they first name it new rome and then it took his name constantinople . 
  the city of constantine in greeks constantinoupoli . 
  every greek city is what greeks took from ottomans btw . 
  its more like muslims didnt want to use the christian name of the city witch is named after the roman emperor constantine the great who changed the capital of the roman empire from rome to byzantium and first name it new roma and after took his name . 
  they didnt want greece to get to big and i guess they didnt want 1 country to control both sides like new byzantium or ottoman empire, 
  they did ? 
  yea those pure fyromacedonians witch have created directly from the balls of alexandrisky the greatisky, 
  \u03b4\u03c1\u03c5\u03c2 is a kind of wood in greeks ancient or modern . 
  and greece will fart and european union explodes, 
  maybe im 15 years old maybe 35 but history is known to every one take the effort to read and you will easy find out that slavs existed 700 years after alexander era, 
  slavs where found around 700 years ago after the macedonians era thats what i mean . 
  700 years later thats wut .
