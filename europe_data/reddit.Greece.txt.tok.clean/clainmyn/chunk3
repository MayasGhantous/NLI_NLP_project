  so slavs are more macedonias than greeks even if slavs was like 700 + years late in history ? 
  they did after 700 + ago, 
  so how come you are macedonians ? 
  do slavs have any connection whit greek history ? 
  the fucking point is slavs did n't exist in this era, 
  you know that macedonia existed 700 + years before slavs do n't you ? 
  you have any connections whit greece ? 
  history where ? 
  does slavs was some how greeks or what ? 
  why anyone in greece will care about ? 
  because his name is alexander the great not alexandrisky the greatisky and his father was philippos not philipisky . 
  or more serious because macedonia existed 700 + before slavs . 
  the nd audience voted him as president of the party do you claim them as traitors ? 
  so much shit in one post first he did n't got kicked he left second and most important he is federalist . 
  as i 'm and i never voted nd . 
  i hope it 's bullshit, 
  the roots of the name issue go back to the mid-1940s , when , in the aftermath of the second world war , commander in chief tito separated from serbia the region that had been known until that time as vardar banovina ( today 's former yugoslav republic of macedonia ) , giving it the status of a federal unit of the new socialist federal republic of macedonia , renaming it , initially , the `` people 's republic of macedonia '' , and , later , the `` socialist republic of macedonia '' . 
  at the same time , he started to cultivate the idea of a separate and discrete `` macedonian nation '' . 
  tito of course had many reasons for making these moves , the main one being to lay the foundations for future yugoslavian territorial claims in the wider region of macedonia and secure an opening on the aegean . 
  tito 's intentions in the wider macedonian region had been confirmed as early as 1944 , when he declared publicly that his goal was to reunify `` all the sections of macedonia that were broken up in 1912 and 1913 by the balkan imperialists . '', 
  the idea for a big macedonia started from tito but stopped early his goal was to get access to the aegean u.s. secretary of state edward stettinius to u.s. 
  missions ( washington , dec. 26 , 1944 ) 1 the secretary of state to certain diplomatic and consular officers the following is for your information and general guidance , but not for any positive action at this time . 
  the department has noted with considerable apprehension increasing propaganda rumors and semi-official statements in favor of an `` autonomous macedonia '' , emanating principally from bulgaria , but also from yugoslav partisan and other sources , with the implication that greek territory would be included in the projected state . 
  this government considers talk of `` macedonian nation '' , `` macedonia fatherland '' , or `` macedonian national consciousness '' to be unjustified demagoguery representing no ethnic or political reality , and sees in its present revival a possible cloak for aggressive intentions against greece . 
  the approved policy of this government is to oppose any revival of the macedonian issue as related to greece . 
  the greek section of macedonia is largely inhabited by greeks , and the greek people are almost unanimously opposed to the creation of a `` macedonian state . '' allegations of serious greek participation in any such agitation can be assumed to be false . 
  this government would regard as responsible any government or group of governments tolerating or encouraging menacing or aggressive acts of `` macedonian forces '' against greece . 
  the department would appreciate any information pertinent to this subject which may come to your attention . 
  stettinius, 
  at least they can use some word of their own . historically , the term `` macedonia '' , which is a greek word , refers to the kingdom and culture of the ancient macedonians . 
  i live in the greek part of macedonia there are parts in bulgaria , albania and ofc in f.y.r.o.m ( btw they joined un whit the condition to use the name `` former yugoslav republic of macedonia '' ) until we find a deal whit the name . 
  there are like 2.5 m ppl in greek part of macedonia isnt those macedonians as well ? 
  or can some country fully claim the name for them on a region witch is spread on 4 ? 
  they can use a geographical qualifier and everyone will be happy . 
  this is dirt game if greece do n't accept them back then turkey will have a claim not do it as well . 
  http://www.protothema.gr/files/1/2016/03/14/xartsssss.png some one printed and give them this map boarders are closed around 5 km so they just had to walk past this area . 
  to lazy to do it, 
  looks like some do n't do that and want to cross the boarder at any given chance . 
  its more like if they open the boarders they need to have the children whit them to run pass before they close them again else children left behind .

  looks like merkel backs him, 
  google kos to see what is shack, 
  relocate wtf people say here we have 2016 not 1916 or something none can touch them from their homes, 
  why you do n't ad france , belgium and italy ? 
  you know why because you are irrelevant and you have no idea why union was created, 
  and here you explain why historians used the term byzantine empire or else they had to pick and name like roman old empire and roman new empire , how you can name when rome is not part of it anymore ? 
  logic i guess, 
  byzantine empire its used from historians to separate it from the era when the empire had capital rome that 's all . 
  it was still roman but it got separated from rome around 400 and changed official language from latin to greek at 610 and lost the identity from old roman empire . . what the fuck is nationalist on been called roman or greek even becuase hellene was consider pagan . 
  it depressor for greeks to be called roman or romioi but this is how it was until the fall of ottoman empire . 
  there was a talk even to decide what name to use of them 3 for the genus between `` hellene '' `` romans '' and `` greeks '' ( '' \u0388\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 '' , '' \u03a1\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03b9 '' and '' \u0393\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af '' ) ... 
  i fucking link you , copy pasting you from https://en.wikipedia.org . 
  the nationalistic bullshit is here from you , you are the one who have nationalistic problems and know nothing about it . 
  you just cant read none told here that it was greek empire and its called byzantine buy historians to separated it whit the roman empire era when rome was capital and you cant tell also that it had zero connection whit greek nationality when they use greek as main language for around 900 years, 
  you bring again that nationalist bullshit ... by late antiquity ( c. 3rd -- 7th century ce ) , the greeks referred to themselves as graikoi ( \u0393\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af , `` greeks '' ) and rhomaioi/romioi ( \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9 / \u03a1\u03c9\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03af , `` romans '' ) the latter of which was used since virtually all greeks were roman citizens after 212 ce . 
  the term `` hellene '' became applied to the followers of the polytheistic ( `` pagan '' ) religion after the establishment of christianity by theodosius i. 
  there was few changes in the roman empire all those years like when it got separated at around 400 ac and when changed the official language to greeks at 610 ac until ottomans took over so allmost 900 years they used greeks as main language means for you zero ( i like you used caps ) greek nationality ... romans or rhomaioi ( \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9 ; sg . 
  \u03a1\u03c9\u03bc\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2 romios ) , is the name by which the greeks were known in the middle ages and during ottoman rule . 
  natiolalism or whatever the fuck you say its your option because you know nothing about this, 
  romans means greeks in medieval era . 
  historians give the name byzantine to separate what was the old roman empire whit capital rome and what is the after roman empire whit capital byzantium . 
  the term `` byzantine empire '' was introduced in 1557 , about a century after the fall of constantinople , by german historian hieronymus wolf , who introduced a system of byzantine historiography in his work corpus historiae byzantinae in order to distinguish ancient roman from medieval greek history without drawing attention to their ancient predecessors . 
  several authors adopted his terminology , but it remained relatively unknown . 
  english historians preferred to use roman terminology ( edward gibbon used it in a particularly belittling manner ) , while french historians preferred to call it greek . 
  the term reappeared in the mid-19th century and has since dominated completely in historiography , even in greece , despite objections from constantine paparregopoulos , gibbon 's influential greek counterpart , that the empire should be called greek . 
  few greek scholars adopted the terminology at that time , but it became popular in the second half of the 20th century . 
  the medieval romans was actually greeks ... romans or rhomaioi ( \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9 ; sg . 
  \u03a1\u03c9\u03bc\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2 romios ) , is the name by which the greeks were known in the middle ages and during ottoman rule . 
  the name comes from the city byzantium after constantine the great made it the new capital of the roman empire . 
  and historians give that name, 
  was byzantine emperor, 
  that indo-european thing is proven 100 % correct or is theory ?
