  we do too . 
  thank you . 
  why do n't you take a look at [ this ] ( http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=anhrs ) ? 
  tl ; dr : greeks work an average of 2.037 hours per annum while germans work only 1.388 hours and dutch people even less ( 1.380 hours ) . 
  it 's unbelievable how some people are perfectly ok with lagarde ( and others like her ) not paying taxes while she 's making half a frigging million a year and at the same time a whole nation is to blame because of their corrupt leaders . 
  do you really think lagarde is not at least as corrupt as the greek politicians ? 
  what about strauss-khan ? 
  what about [ uk 's political scandals ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_scandals_in_the_united_kingdom ) ? 
  just because something is lawful does n't mean that it 's ethical . 
  if i learned one thing during the greek crisis , it 's that poll results depend more than anything else on who commissions them . 
  i do n't . 
  still does n't make that poll trustworthy . 
  polls do n't mean shit in this country anymore , just look at the referendum . 
   rehiring 1500 previously ** illegally ** laid off public sector workers but maybe justice does n't matter anymore in the eu . 
  source ? 
  wikipedia claims 158.000 dead in the [ civil war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_civil_war ) and 206.900 ( +300.000 to 600.000 due to famine and disease ) dead during [ world war 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_ii_casualties ) . 
  greece lost 7 % - 11 % of its population during ww2 . 
  but even if what you say were true , the civil war was a direct result of ww2 and us/british actions after the german and italian occupation . 
  and i think that you do not understand the moral bigotry here . 
  we never shoved people in ovens by the masses to get rid of them , but germany deserved debt forgiveness while greece does n't . 
  ultimately , the question is if it is justified that people suffer just because of money . 
  i think it 's not . 
   yeah , germany started ** one world war ** , it was responsible for over 50 million deaths and sunk europe in a deep crisis for years . 
  a crisis that would 've doomed the whole continent if the usa did n't want to create strong allies against the warsaw pact . 
   sure , they really did deserve the debt relief . 
  but fuck the greeks . 
  they borrowed more money than they could handle . 
  let them rot . 
  better now ? 
  the second part comes from the greek word '' \u03b5\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 '' = revolution . 
  so i guess it 's rebellious revolution or rebolution or something like that . 
  i lol 'd . 
  thank you . 
  thank you for your answer . 
  however , what i 'm more interested in is if the country 's central bank was nationalized or not . 
  can i ask you something ? 
  is it true that chavez nationalized everything except venezuela 's central bank ? 
  splitters , splitters ... 
  it 's straight out of a monty python sketch . 
  / thread, 
  ca n't complain about that , the weather 's very nice . 
  lol , mine delays the payments for a long time now . 
  i 'm currently 3,5 months behind with a wage of about 700 $ . 
  oth , i have absolutely nothing at the bank and do n't have to wait at the atm . 
  so i have that going for me which is ... ah , forget it . 
  imf in a couple years on the 65 % unemployment rate : oops , we made a mistake . 
  that is before taxes by the way . 
  i know people ( security officers ) who work a 6-day workweek with night-shifts and no sunday/holidays off and their wage is around 450 $ after taxes ( the employer illegally withholds sunday/night-shift raises ) . 
  greece should never have joined the euro -- it used false statistics . 
  ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite3_1_08/12/2011_417884$ )  people often make the mistake of lumping these two issues together when there is clear distinction between the two . 
  ** there is a valid economic argument that greece , and several other countries , should not have joined the euro when they did . 
  in greece 's cases , it had achieved only a superficial convergence based on public debt and deficit figures but the negative underlying economic factors should have meant that the greek organ was rejected in this currency transplant . 
  ** the structural problems that greece never addressed , such as its decrepit public administration and weak production base , meant that it was at a disadvantage from the start and would have had to undergo a remarkable transformation -- one which was never attempted by the country 's timid politicians -- to achieve a sound footing within the eurozone . 
   instead , greece ended up producing only one euro of its own wealth for every three that it imported over the last decade . 
  however , this issue is totally removed from that of forged statistics . 
  it has become a throwaway line for commentators and journalists to write that greece fibbed its way into the euro . 
  this misconception is largely driven by the decision of the new democracy government that came to power in march 2004 to conduct an audit of public finances that led to greece 's budget deficit figure being revised upward , above the 3 percent of gross domestic product limit for euro-area members . 
  ** however , the deficit increase was largely down to the conservative administration changing the way military expenditure was recorded . 
  ** rather than record the spending when the procurements were delivered , it attributed them to the date when the orders were made . 
  this exposed a weakness in the way that the eurozone treated statistics . 
  ** by failing to agree on a uniform system for all , it allowed statistics to be open to political manipulation in several member states , not just greece . 
  ** it is an issue that the european commission has only addressed over the last few months . 
  as dimitris kontogiannis revealed in kathimerini english edition recently , the eu now uses the delivery method to record procurements , which means greece 's deficit when it joined the european monetary union in 1999 met the 3 percent target . 
   ** according to the commission 's database , several other countries ' deficits , including france and spain , were over 3 percent . 
  ** some will argue that this is irrelevant now and in a sense it is . 
  but the regular rehashing of this myth has contributed to the impression among commentators , as well as average europeans , that greece has to answer for an original sin even though this offense was never committed . 
  establishing the truth has to be the first step to rebuilding trust . 
  please also read [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stability_and_growth_pact#criticism )  the `` creative accounting '' gimmickry used by many countries to achieve the required deficit to gdp ratio of 3 percent , and by the immediate abandonment of fiscal prudence by some countries as soon as they were included in the euro club . 
  also , the stability pact has been watered down at the request of germany and france . 
   it 's much better that you act all butt-hurt and run away in a huff instead of actually answering . 
  there 's nothing to answer . 
  i have no prejudice on people 's opinions based on their profession . 
  i pointed out to you that this is a logical fallacy , but you seem to lack basic comprehension skills as you still want me to show how i think that stone is more `` competent '' than someone else . 
  i do n't know and i do n't care if that 's the case as it has no importance at all on his statement and the article he mentions . 
  so instead of attacking persons ( stone , weisbrot , whoever ) you should comment on the actual statement taking advantage of your `` in extenso studies of the problem '' . 
  instead you go on trying to insult me by comparing me to porn director ( lolwut ? ) . 
  i 'm going to end this conversation here as you obviously are not capable of discussing in a civilized manner . 
  have a happy life . 
   lets see you answering mine . 
  dude , you did n't even ask me a question . 
  but never mind , it 's ok , you totally convinced me with your brilliant points such as `` i actually studied the problem in extenso for a few years now '' and `` i think a little i know '' . 
  however your most convincing argument is `` you , personally , feel superior to a porn director '' , i mean you actually destroyed me . 
  i 'm done . 
  just tell me mr. 
  expert , why are you wasting your time on a shitty reddit thread when you have so much experience ? 
  ok , explain to me what makes ~ ~ oliver stone ~ ~ you more competent than ... i do n't know ... chi chi larue for instance . 
   the `` look , this director thinks we are amazing '' attitude has literally 0 value for the discussion . 
  as opposed to the value you 're bringing to the discussion ? 
  the issue is that you 're attacking him personally instead of addressing his statement and/or the article he mentioned . 
  the word `` humbug '' is often used in the german language . 
  it is usually synonymous to `` nonsense '' or `` bullshit '' . 
   for european taxpayers , a greek default has one further benefit : it sends a message to creditors that lending carries real risks , so they should be more careful in future . 
  it almost seems like this is an unthinkable notion in european politics . 
   the spending was ( mainly ) done to their advantage ( or at least to the advantage of many people ) how do you know that ?
