   how were they able to do it for 20 years without anyone noticing ? 
  many people did notice but court procedures can be lengthy . 
  in general , large companies are able to do what they do by giving special treatment to corrupt politicians , publishing costly full-page ads in newspapers and magazines , buying off journalists etc. 
  rub my back and i 'll rub yours . 
   is this just some scheme to get back at the germans ? 
  the dispute goes way back . 
  plus , german companies have also been found guilty of not playing by the rules in many other countries . 
  `` german '' is not a synonym for `` angel '' and `` greek '' is not a synonym for `` devil '' . 
  it 's all over greek media , the airport is in greece and it 's a recent greek court decision . 
  eventually it 's going to be picked up by international media .

  der spiegel published and will publish new stories about these . 
  i know that some people are in denial , but it 's high time they realised that corruption is not a genetic trait . 
   the greek government 's own investigators came to a similar result , especially on some of the islands you probably do n't speak greek . 
  inspections in mainland and island locations are targeted . 
  this is the way all similar european tax evasion departments work . 
  they gather intelligence on their own , listen to customer complaints etc. 
  they do n't just roam around because they would waste resources . 
  [ this is the latest ministry of finance press release ] ( http://www.minfin.gr/portal/el/resource/contentobject/id/5d10a1e7-c8ee-4b2e-ac58-a31d546f4402 ) about the results of the investigations during the first 7 months of 2014 . 
  google translation is a bit messy but you can figure out what 's going on . 
    the police economic crime ( sdoe ) publishes aggregated results of surveys conducted during the first seven months of 2014 in the framework of its powers . 
    during the above period conducted 2,639 investigations in selected against 2,295 planned , ie the objective oversubscribed at 115 % . 
  there were 390,028 offenses to 1,872 offenders ( average delinquency rate of 54 % ) . 
    the sdoe also accepted at the same time , to explore 755 prosecutors orders , of which 585 already settled off while being examined and are integration-from preceding years 1684 . 
  the economic crime unit ( \u03a3\u0394\u039f\u0395 ) investigated more businesses than they had planned to . 
  half of the business ** that were targeted ** were found to break the law for a number of reasons . 
  that 's ** not ** half of all businesses in greece . 
  you might be impressed by the large number of offenses per business but that 's easy to explain . 
  most of these businesses are fast food restaurants , taverns , bars and nightclubs . 
  offenses vary in seriousness . 
  in many cases they did issue receipts and pay their taxes but they were fined based on the number of customers present during the inspection night for other reasons . 
   he 's actually making it quite clear that the wide spread tax evasion results in higher taxes for those who pay them i take issue with the assessment about allegedly widespread tax evasion , not with the general principle that those paying tax also pay for tax evaders . 
  in fact , tax evasion per capita and in total amounts is bigger in countries considered fiscally sound . 
  [ netherlands , for example . 
  ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-23/yahoo-dell-swell-netherlands-13-trillion-tax-haven.html ) together with [ ireland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/double_irish_arrangement ) they make the best sandwiches . 
  also germany accepted [ 1 % of hidden german wealth in switzerland ] ( http://www.globalsocialjustice.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=133:david-mcnair&amp;catid=5:analysis&amp;itemid=6 ) . 
  let 's not forget the role of luxembourg for central and north europe while we 're at it . 
  but i do n't see many people making much fuss about it . 
  greece 's current position can not be explained by moralizing or by attributing everything to the greek inability to deal with tax evasion . 
  tax evasion exists but this was n't the main factor driving greece through successive deficits , resulting in being blocked from the markets and ending up in a troika program . 
   he 's also in jail because of it . 
  he was not in jail for the better part of his life and he was considered a model citizen until he was caught . 
  he ended up in jail after an investigation and after his political connections and his expensive lawyers failed to save him . 
  the difference is that i do n't think that the german society as a whole failed because it enables people like uli to do what he did . 
  there is nothing that makes greeks or germans or irish or other europeans better or worse than other nations . 
  that 's because [ this guy ] ( http://www.linkedin.com/pub/giorgos-christides/25/120/86 ) wrote it in english and shopped around to find an outlet . 
  so some spiegel readers are probably thinking that the corrupt greeks drink champagnes all day long with that undeclared vat , because one guy wrote something about a few other guys . 
  well all germans must be doing the same because bayern munich 's boss was a tax evader . 
  and all greeks must be nazis because golden dawn exists . 
  does not compute . 
  the shit greece has been through are surreal , complex issues can not be explained by blowing some things out of proportion . 
  fwiw i 'm a greek and i 've never been denied a receipt since i remember myself . 
  i 'm older than most redditors here . 
  nobody 's trying to cover anything up . 
  it 's just some leftist media and journalists trying to equate holding armed terrorists in maximum security prisons with greece sliding to fascism . 
  it 's laughable . 
  see my other comments above . 
   full of inconsistencies and exaggerations and omissions . 
  basically this is self-promotion . 
  it 's op 's own article and op does not represent the greek society in general . 
  some armed terrorists escaped a while ago and another one got caught recently . 
  these guys are nutcases and can not be held in regular prisons . 
  so you have the vast majority of greeks agreeing with maximum security prisons and a minority of leftists seeing fascism everywhere and trying to correlate everything with austerity . 
  while it 's indisputable that the austerity program did not succeed ( even imf admitted its failings ) i see no relation between these two . 
  [ read my comments in the previous self-promotion attempt by op ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/201l1d/cancer_and_hiv_patients_in_greeces_biggest_prison/cfz8hmn ) to understand where he comes from . 
  i disagree . 
  3 in 4 greeks do n't walk the syriza way . 
  greeks would be tempted to experiment with syriza if 4 out 10 of them voted for this party in the parliamentary elections , given the electoral law we have now . 
  still less than the majority but almost enough to rule on their own . 
  but this wo n't happen ever .

  sorry for the quality , it 's a quicky and i 've only got paint in this laptop . 
  this might be of help . 
  not really . 
  it 's not the national election and it 's silly to draw conclusions from these results . 
  nevertheless , some pollsters did the math and syriza is far from dominating the greek political landscape . 
  sorry for the quality , it 's a quicky and i 've only got paint in this laptop . 
  a straw-man argument does n't mean what you think it means in this case . 
  it does n't mean `` a nitwit might think what i 've misread '' . 
  as a journalist you should learn to be more careful . 
  arguments are not words thrown here and there . 
  you were the one claiming that i spread false information about you , because you wrote that the greek media you write for do n't pay you . 
  i have no way and no intention to claim or verify that . 
  but i did not state anything like that from the beginning and this is evident to everyone with reading skills . 
  my argument was that a bunch of people and media engage in a counter-propaganda war , and that i find hipster populism despicable . 
  you 're just lucky because the government propagandists are nitwits and lack social media skills . 
  i could write more about you and your ilk since your twitter timelines are full of gems , but i 'm stopping the off-topic discussion here . 
  you are able to write better while remaining at your ideological standpoint . 
  i suggest that you do so . 
  read again . 
   he ** writes ** for the new media started by people who previously worked for `` the establishment '' without any complaints . 
  no false information here . 
  you write for them . 
  you are associated with them . 
  i did ** not ** state that they pay you .
