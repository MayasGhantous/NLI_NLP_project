  finally , their prime minister [ laying a wreath under a map of the so-called `` united macedonia '' ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-p-wp3q7jbr0/t-iseyvvzpi/aaaaaaaaefy/lrmuhmuwpdm/s1600/violation3.jpg ) is not going to do them any favours . 
   you have to assume you just have to use logic instead of fabricating a series of conspiracy theories and rushing into conclusions . 
  you also have to remember that we 're talking about armed terrorists that glorify violence against innocent people , in order to fund their war , as they call it , against the establishment . 
   then police could have even if the police used only one device to photograph them , and all the timestamps ( create , write , modify ) were showing the exact same time , some people would still argue that the police could have altered the metadata . 
  some people will * never * trust * any * police forces . 
  some people * will * agree with the robbery . 
  but police forces are * not * by definition and in * any * case assholes . 
  that 's like constantly calling all germans nazis . 
   none of these claims follow from the photos that the police present as evidence . 
  there is other evidence . 
  a ) amateur video taken immediately after their arrest , showing a bloody face . 
  b ) citizen eyewitnesses , scattered around , talking about struggle . 
  of course , some people would still argue that citizen eyewitnesses might have been paid off , and that george lucas was responsible for the special effects on that video . 
  this is where i rest my case . 
  amnesty international relies on second-hand information and stupidly issued a report before they had all the data . 
  the photo was too dark and the police brightened it as a whole . 
  they did not turn him into marilyn monroe . 
  by the way , you owe me an answer ( pm ) . 
  watching the full video and getting back to you . 
  give me 20 minutes . 
   they state that there was not a conflict but only a disarmament during the arrest . 
  ** this is a lie . 
  this guy is talking about ** kozani ** , his jurisdiction . 
  they were called after the robbery took place ( 3:51 of video ) . 
  the robber arrested in kozani ( ptolemaida ) was not injured , because he did not resist . 
  the * other * guy from imathia later talks about a dynamic intervention . 
  that 's police lingo for things that got a little bit ugly for the perpetrators . 
  let me paste it again from my first comment . 
   * 4 people were arrested . 
  3 of them in [ veria ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/veria ) , where the armed robbery took place , 1 in [ ptolemaida ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ptolemaida ) . 
   * the 3 arrested in veria were injured . 
  the person arrested in ptolemaida was not . 
   * the person arrested in ptolemaida did not resist . 
  regarding your other point now . 
   the 3 robbers had probably light injured during the arrest , but were brutally tortured later . 
  their injuries were documented by multiple sources ( citizens and policemen ) right after their arrest . 
   try reading what you are commenting on next time . 
  i did . 
  try understanding what is the point next time . 
  police * themselves * say they were photographed informally using a mobile phone , immediately after arrival at the police station , and then with a digital camera . 
  what are we trying to establish here ? 
  that they were * already * injured following their arrest . 
  stay with me for a bit . 
  * arrest -  12:50 * amateur video showing bloody face -  12:50 something * place holding them after arrest , before the transfer -  in the center of the city , with people watching * mobile photos showing injuries -  13:10 something -- the files on the computer were * written * at 13:30 or slightly before that . 
  an example . 
  1 ) mobile photo name : 20130201_131151 . jpg computer timestamps : created 13:53:57 ** last written 13:32:30 ** modified 13:53:57 phone timestamp : ** 13:11:50 ** 2 ) digital camera photo name : 1.jpg computer timestamps : created 13:53:57 ** last written 13:31:38 ** modified 15:23:41 camera timestamp : ** 14:31:28 ** camera was still in dst . 
   here 's an article explaining why the investigation made by the greek police does little in the way of proving there was no abuse . 
  the article is written by a person reproducing syriza 's ( leftists ) press release , adding a few points which i 'll examine below . 
  this is syriza 's press release . 
  http://www.syn.gr/gr/keimeno.php?id=30781 syriza asks 4 questions . 
  in brief : * is the investigation reliable ? 
  * why is it that only the perpetrators were injured ? 
  * are the testimonies corroborated by forensic doctors ' findings ? 
  * should we consider the report reliable , since `` amnesia international '' ( that 's what they wrote instead of amnesty international ) talks about a culture of impunity inside the greek police forces ? 
  as you see , baboulias ' article is merely translating syriza 's press release . 
  let discuss all points now . 
  the ministry responded immediately . 
  for the record , syriza did not pursue this matter after the ministry 's response . 
  http://www.mopocp.gov.gr/index.php?option=ozo_content&amp;perform=view&amp;id=4499&amp;itemid=564&amp;lang= * the investigations for cases concerning the public sector are carried out by the competent authorities . 
  you do n't appoint judges or investigators some random people from the street . 
  police forces worldwide have separate branches carrying out these tasks . 
  this investigation was carried out by the office of internal affairs . 
  these are the same people carrying out investigations about rogue cops associated with drug dealers etc. 
  * a policeman was also injured , and this is added to their long list of charges . 
  * the perpetrators refused to collect the forensic order forms , in order to be examined by a forensics doctor !, 
  but with the criminal investigation underway , one way or another they will have to be examined . 
  * there is nothing wrong with the metadata . 
  the metadata are only confusing for those that ca n't read them . 
  ffs , you of all people are qualified to read them . 
  pay attention to the file names . 
  baboulias plays dumb or purposedly mixes the different timestamps and file write/modification times . 
  i 'll give you one example . 
  they were arrested at 12:50 . 
  they were inside the police station 20 minutes later . 
  the timestamps from the mobile photos are in the file names ( 20130201_131151 . jpg , 20130201_131301 . jpg , 20130201_131411 . jpg ) . 
  that 's how many mobile phones work . 
  * they were arrested at 12:50 . 
  there are citizen eyewitnesses reporting the struggle . 
  there is even a video showing the bloody face of one of them . 
  they were in the middle of the city , held for a few minutes and then taken to the police station . 
  minutes later , we have photos showing clearly that they were hit in their faces . 
  in case that is difficult to understand how bruising works , when you get hit your face does n't turn black instantly . 
  * the new conspiracy theory with the clock is absolutely ridiculous . 
  the sun is shining , the clock shows 8:25 . 
  they were brought in 5 hours later . 
  obviously the clock run out of battery . 
  regarding past actions by some members of the police forces , i think that i covered that in my previous comment . 
  did you miss this ?
