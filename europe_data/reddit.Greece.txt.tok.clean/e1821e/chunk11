   * the 3 were brought into the police station at around 13:00 -13:05 . 
   * there are informal photographs taken with a mobile showing them sitting in an office at around 13:11 -13:14 . 
  there are also photographs taken with a digital camera at around 13:30 . 
  police released the photos and the metadata in both circumstances .

   personally , i think it was a stupid decision . 
  i can understand their line of thought though . 
  these guys are linked to terrorism activities and they wanted to publish information to the public as soon as possible . 
  they cleaned most of the blood from their faces but bruises would n't vanish . 
  one of them would n't stand up , they doctored the hand holding him up . 
  another photo was too dark , they brightened it . 
  same with bruises , they tried to make them disappear ( albeit with comical results ) in order to make their faces more recognizable . 
   2 ) what about greek police 's history with violence/torture claims ? 
  some of them are true , and the same is unfortunately true for other police forces in europe and around the world . 
  -- also see notangelamerkel 's comment about the new conspiracy theory regarding the clock . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/184zvg/evidence_against_the_alleged_torture_of_armed/c8c5ce9  the clock shows 8:25 . 
  if the clock is working , then it must be 8:25 in the morning , because the photo is clearly taken before sunset . 
  but the robbers were brought in this office 5 hours after 8:25 . 
   conclusion : the clock has run out of battery and nobody bothered to change it because they 're surrounded by computers and mobile phones telling them the time . 
  only the last sentence was sarcastic . 
  this part is not . 
   i 'm british cypriot ( which , by the way , is quite a big minority over here ), 
   i am of the opinion that there is no such thing as a greek cypriot and a turkish cypriot there 's no such thing , according to you , but then you say ...  i 'm british cypriot if self-identification is a valid concept for you , then you should n't have any problems with the majority of cypriots identifying themselves as greeks , as they do now . 
  leaves on the line . 
  sparrows on the line . 
  aliens on the line . 
  my condolences , germany . 
  you cried * obvious * torture from the start . 
  there are reports about them continuing to resist during their transfer , after the arrest . 
  the investigation is ongoing and we 'll have more data soon . 
  the edits attempt to make them more recognizable . 
  the mother of one of the terrorists told the media that she was unable to recognize her son because of the bruises . 
  that 's what the policeman ordering the edits thought . 
  the technique might be ridiculous , but that 's another story . 
  they wanted recent photos of them for the public to see . 
  one of them would n't stand up , they removed the hand . 
  another photo was too dark , they brightened it . 
  i would n't do that , but that 's their line of thought . 
  what makes no sense for you might make sense for others . 
  making sense of something does n't mean advocating it . 
  that 's all there 's left to say for the moment . 
  find the three episodes of `` the rise and fall of the c.i.a. '', 
  ( 1975 ) from the [ world in action ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_in_action ) , a hugely influential investigative current affairs programme . 
  if you ca n't find the dvds , the box has it . 
  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2294373/  an investigation into whether the american central intelligence agency has become too big . 
  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2294375/  an investigation into the ways the central intelligence agency has sought to bring down entire governments in countries iran , guyana , and cuba . 
  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2294377/  investigation into wars waged by the central intelligence agency together with american presidents , and the their longterm consequences . 
  it will help you to understand cia 's way of thinking . 
  an example . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thomas_braden  in 1950 , at the start of the korean war , braden joined the cia and in 1950 became head of the international organizations division ( iod ) of cia 's office of policy coordination , the `` covert action '' arm of agency secret operations , working closely with allen dulles and frank wisner . 
  believing that the cultural milieu of post-war europe at the time was favorable toward left-wing views , and understanding that the establishment of western allies was rigidly conservative and nationalistic as well as determined to maintain their colonial dominions , it was estimated that american supremacy would be best served by supporting the democratic left . 
  thus , the program was begun by which more moderate and especially anti-soviet leftists would be supported thereby helping to purge the social democratic left of soviet sympathizers . 
  from the tv interview :  `` if the director of cia wanted to extend a present , say , to someone in europe -- a labour leader -- suppose he just thought , this man can use fifty thousand dollars , he 's working well and doing a good job -- he could hand it to him and never have to account to anybody ... 
  there was simply no limit to the money it could spend and no limit to the people it could hire and no limit to the activities it could decide were necessary to conduct the war -- the secret war ... 
  it was a multinational . 
  maybe it was one of the first . 
  journalists were a target , labor unions a particular target -- that was one of the activities in which the communists spent the most money '' who needs crazy conspiracy theories , it 's business as usual . 
  do n't spoil a good story with your , what 's this thing , logic !, 
  are n't you getting an extra grant if you do n't pass the stones before the government looting ? 
   no matter how obvious you think their guilt is , this in now way gives the state the right to beat them or otherwise torture them . 
  you seem to think that they policemen are obviously guilty of torturing them ( nobody saw this ) , but you 're holding your guns about their crimes ( many did ) . 
  there 's nothing left to say , really . 
  we 'll talk about it when we have more data . 
  i did n't write that there was a shootout . 
  i wrote this . 
   ** we were n't there . 
  ** but there is n't a straight line from a to b. 
  ** there are many possible explanations . 
  ** i listed some * possible * explanations because we 're still waiting for more information to come out . 
  by the way , i 'm not downvoting you . 
  http://i.imgur.com/38jhbwl.jpg i presume you read the news today . 
  these guys are not clean , they were involved in some serious shit . 
  as for the abuse claims , there 's an investigation . 
  to be frank , given many people 's tendency to cry foul play over anything involving the authorities , even there is n't any abuse they will still not believe it . 
   if these guys held guns and put up a fight , how the hell is it possible that there was no shootout ? 
  we were n't there . 
  but there is n't a straight line from a to b. 
  there are many possible explanations . 
  * there was a shootout * they run out of bullets * they missed * they were circled and outnumbered * they hesitated to shoot * they realized they were finished and put up a last stand after being disarmed * a combination of the above * another reason i 'm too sleepy to think of  i just saw evidence of torture before me no , you saw bruised and beaten guys and reached an immediate conclusion : torture . 
  bruises plus police involvement does not equal torture . 
  history of policemen involved in torture does not equal torture in any case police is involved , in greece or in the rest of the world . 
  take a look at my comments above . 
  i did n't issue a verdict about their crimes . 
  the armed robbery took place in front of people 's eyes . 
  but if you have to take an issue with that , what gives you the right to issue a verdict about obvious torture ? 
  do you have evidence ? 
  do you have a court decision ? 
  obviously not . 
  then why accusing me of something you 're also guilty for ? 
  you said that the pictures speak for themselves . 
  do you realize that they were armed and held a hostage ? 
  do you understand that they were not ready to give up ? 
  they put up a fight . 
  * [ press release of police dpt in that area ] ( http://translate.google.gr/translate?sl=el&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=el&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.astynomia.gr%2findex.php%3foption%3dozo_content%26lang%3d%27..%27%26perform%3dview%26id%3d24446%26itemid%3d1055%26lang%3d&amp;act=url )  it is hereby announced that on 02/01/2013 in veria , during the arrest of three perpetrators bringing heavy armor ( kalashnikov , skorpion submachine-type gun , pistols , and repeating rifle ) , who were pursued for two armed robberies having been committed on the morning of 01/02/2013 in velvento in kozani , as well as for holding a person hostage , effective disarmament and safe release of the hostage has been sought and achieved , after using the absolutely necessary measures for self-protection of the policemen and for the safeguarding and protection of the citizens , given that the operation was in development in the busiest and most central area of the city of veria and there was no loss of human life . 
   in the framework of this arrest operation , in order to neutralize the armed robbers and free the hostage , the policemen in operation exercised the absolutely necessary judicially permissible enforced physical violence , during the engagement , the disarmament , and the neutralization of the raised resistance .
