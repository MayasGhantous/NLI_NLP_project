  you know greek , i fixed a bit the google translation for other redditors . 
  not perfect but everyone gets the idea . 
  they had guns , they held a hostage , they were in a central spot with lots of people , it was a dirty job and someone had to do it . 
  i 'm right there with you about the ridiculously doctored photos , but do not let a nitwit bureaucrat in an office uploading photos discredit the people trying to save lives against people involved in terrorist activities . 
  i 'm not sure why you 're writing about `` alleged '' bank robbers but `` obvious '' torture . 
  * it was a double armed robbery with two teams consisting of 4 people each . 
  * people saw the [ license plates of the vehicles they used to escape ] ( http://www.ert.gr/eidiseis/topika-nea/kozani/item/139462-kozani-enopli-listeia-sto-velvento ) . 
  * there were [ arrest warrants in their names for participating in a terrorist organization ] ( http://news247.gr/eidiseis/koinonia/eglima/pws_edrasan_oi_lhstes_ston_velvento_kozanhs.2112181.html ) . 
  * they resisted arrest and [ that 's how they got themselves injured ] ( http://www.mopocp.gov.gr/index.php?option=ozo_content&amp;perform=view&amp;id=4488&amp;itemid=564&amp;lang= ) . 
  * research continues and today [ fingerprints of one of the people involved were found in a flat used by the terrorist organization ] ( http://www.astynomia.gr/index.php?option=ozo_content&amp;lang='..'&amp;perform=view&amp;id=24443&amp;itemid=1058&amp;lang= ) . 
  they 're not harmless kittens . 
  they are armed robbers and terrorists . 
  the police is requesting information about these people . 
  the person uploading the photos probably thought that the public would have a better chance in recognizing them if their faces were n't covered in bruises . 
  stupid thought but this has nothing to to with an attempt to cover alleged torture . 
  let me summarize . 
  you are 1 left-wing person from romania , a former communist country . 
  you spoke to 1 left-wing person from greece , which is not a former communist country . 
  you think that he represents the prevalent mentality in greece , which according to you is to accept capitalist terms that will make the lives of people more difficult . 
  your conclusion is that greeks are more or less crypto-communist masochists . 
  i 'm not sure if it ever occurred to you that there are other explanations , which you are not able to see because of your ideological prism . 
  so you spoke to 1 left-wing greek . 
  uk does n't share a land border with the rest of the eu countries . 
  uk is not even in the schengen zone . 
  uk has border controls . 
  if illegal immigrants end up in the uk it is uk 's problem . 
  vote for competent politicians and hire competent people to deal with that . 
  baseball caps do not cover your face . 
  full face covering is an entirely different matter . 
  there are two reasons i 'm supporting this . 
  a ) women are oppressed . 
  i do n't buy that it 's their choice . 
  it 's as much a choice as in the case of an offer one ca n't refuse , from a mafia boss . 
  if they did not obey , they would have to leave their families or be subjected to verbal and physical abuse . 
  b ) catching criminals is easier . 
  we already expose our face and give out our personal data . 
  banning full face covering does n't hurt anyone . 
  laments about lost freedom in choices are out of place . 
  that 's how organized societies function . 
  we all give a little . 
  thanks . 
  ca n't you click the link in the comment you 're replying to ? 
  full face covering should be banned . 
  things like [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:persian_girl.jpg ) are ok . 
   the problem is on going and turkey is n't a member yet that 's why i wrote about revoking turkey 's * candidate * status . 
  `` do you want to be a member of the club ? 
  behave like you want to be a member of the club . '', 
   in the meantime feel free to consider it hearsay \u0399 wo n't , i 'm just curious about the discussion and the information the negotiators shared . 
  bbc article does n't mention the niqab . 
   european court of justice ( do n't read echr ) i 'm well aware of the differences between coe and eu . 
  maybe i should change my username to notadailymailreader . 
    it 's a big thing . 
  not migration , which is allowed , but asylum . 
  i know about the asylum applications . 
  being a greek , i also know about the hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter the eu via turkey . 
  this would cause a humanitarian crisis in * any * eu country , that 's why your read some horror stories . 
  but my point is that it seems * way * off for the netherlands to complain about traces of second hand smoke from miles away . 
  if the dutch and other central or northern europeans want to do something constructive , i suggest the following . 
  * revoking turkey 's candidate status until it stops occupying half of cyprus and turning a blind eye to smugglers of illegal immigrants * lobbying to put an end to the sham know as dublin ii, 
  was n't aware of this site , thanks . 
   dutch politicians in recent years have considered rejecting the schengen treaty over concerns it cripples their ability to fight illegal immigration the netherlands : surrounded by eu members , without any sea routes connecting the country to africa and the middle east , complaining about illegal immigration . 
  wtf . 
  do you remember anything relevant that will help us find the video ? 
  was it recent ? 
  who took the interview ? 
  was it on newsnight or any other bbc program ? 
  `` sanctation without representation '', 
  he could find some official data from 1914 though . 
  i agree , it 's always the way we use a tool , not the tool itself . 
  i do n't blame you , i was merely attempting to explain what is going on in our society . 
  from splits and creation of new parties , to the exponential growth of others . 
  the protest vote in the previous elections is what transformed the political landscape . 
  what is your opinion about anastasiadis ? 
  he seems to be polling higher than the others , but i remember people in the past thought he was concessive ( \u03b5\u03bd\u03b4\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 , i 'm not sure what is the appropriate term to convey the meaning from greek ) . 
  i do n't see how this will end well for the users , if we do n't build another series of tubes free from government intervention . 
  attempts to build layers upon layers of security over this internet are slow and fail . 
  there is another older party called greek ecologists , but they 're not affiliated with the green party found in other european countries , as naurgul pointed out . 
  the definition of `` protest vote '' is meaningless , in reality protest vote is also a vote for some other parties . 
  i 'm sure you 've heard before the usual mantra `` pasok and nd destroyed us , let 's vote for the others '' , especially from older people . 
  thanks for the poll though !, 
  he just reproduced excerpts from a czech article . 
  http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/cez-packing-its-bags-in-albania-after-months-of-controversy the article has no data about the claims and blame 's albania 's regulator and citizens . 
  then i made the right suggestion . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europa_ ( mythology ), 
  [ thessaloniki ] ( http://wikitravel.org/en/thessaloniki ) . 
  blame the corrupt portuguese !, 
  it 's not * absolute * that you will get sick and die , but it 's easier for children and older people to catch a cold . 
  if you 're wet , it does n't matter if you 're a child or an elderly person . 
  besides , it 's unhygienic to sleep wet on a dry pillow . 
   greece got into the mess they 're in by themselves let 's not forget : it 's more complicated than you 'd think . 
   the head of greece 's statistics service , andreas georgiou , and two board members at the hellenic statistical authority ( elstat ) are to face felony charges regarding the alleged manipulation of the country 's deficit figure in 2009 . http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_22/01/2013_479717  and they voluntary accepted all the loans they made . 
  which were loans for german and french banks , in reality . 
  euro coins of the republic of england & wales wo n't have the queen . 
   bankrupt , corrupt countries , like greece , are receiving lots of money to get back up on their feet ; that is , prevent their states from being dismantled due to literally running out of money to pay for police , pensions etc. 
   this money comes from taxpayers from richer , not-so-corrupt countries . 
  none of the above is true . 
  i do n't want to sound rude , but you really do n't have a clue . 
  i do n't blame you , because that 's what you 've been led to believe . 
  it 's a pitty , because we 've been through all these so many times here . 
  he was a good , moderate person , an oasis of reason in turkey 's media .
