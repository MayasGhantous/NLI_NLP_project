  rip . 
  indeed . 
  maybe they thought they would avoid an investigation if they deleted it ? 
  mirror here : http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=beb_1358359911, 
  that 's a conspiracy theory . 
  it is said that police are on these people 's trail , but nothing 100 % confirmed yet . 
  they keep arresting various left-wing terrorists for a number of cases . 
  99 % of terrorism incidents in greece have been associated with anarchists and leftists . 
  [ november 17 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolutionary_organization_17_november ) was the most famous group of all . 
  after their arrest , many groups try to `` fill the gap '' . 
  we 'll ask the 1m of pvv voters for that . 
  i loled . 
  yeah , keep doing this , events like these will go down well in the future . 
  fun is one thing , bad taste and hatred is another . 
   nobody believes it and the source for that is your personal belief that nobody believes it , despite having no sources to support this , and never asking anyone about it . 
  this is similar to the palace 's response to the monarchy issue : `` well , we do n't believe they want to be asked '' the pythons could use this in a sketch . 
   what you 're arguing does n't exist no , it 's just that you 've been conditioned into believing that the monarchy is harmless , which is a wrong and undemocratic view . 
  every child has to have the right to rise to the highest government post of a state . 
  let me put it differently : could you have a black jewish king ? 
  the end . 
  [ your questions have been answered already ] ( http://www.republic.org.uk/what%20we%20want/win%20the%20argument/index.php ) , it is meaningless to continue to do this . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dieu_et_mon_droit  dieu et mon droit is the motto of the british monarch in england . 
  it appears on a scroll beneath the shield of the coat of arms of the united kingdom . 
  the motto refers to the divine right of the monarch to govern * you * might not think of the issue of divine rule . 
  * other * people , meaning people that are not * you * , do think of that . 
  the monarch is also the supreme governor of the church of england . 
  this is not a random motto and a random title for millions of anglicans . 
  it * is * a taboo issue for the vast majority of the people of the uk . 
  it is considered unpatriotic to question the monarchy . 
  other people from the uk think the same , some of them commenting below . 
  i also remember people writing to the queen and asking for a referendum . 
  the palace responded something along the lines of `` the people of the uk have no interest in this matter '' . 
  how the hell do they know ? 
  did they ask them about it ? 
  the answer is no . 
  so , spare us the insults . 
  people have differing opinions and you might not always be right about something , get used to it . 
  some people have different opinions , shocking !, 
   a very real possibility wan na bet about it ? 
  name your price , choose the conditions and i 'm in . 
  it would be easy money for me . 
  i 'm also glad that we abolished ours . 
  itt i 've learned that people can not distinguish between forms of government , and resort to ridiculous excuses . 
  op i hope that your armor holds up !, 
   greece abolished theirs in 1974 . 
  as a greek , i can confirm this and i 'm glad that we did it . 
  notangelamerkel is another greek from athens as you can see from his comment history . 
   the explanation in the title showed a terrible understanding ; even possibly looking for a knee jerk reaction or there 's another explanation , where constitutional matters are polarizing subjects , especially for some people living in monarchies . 
  having a disagreement or a different interpretation does not make you stupid , it 's just a taboo subject that many are not prepared to discuss properly . 
  can you understand the difference between choosing and not choosing something ? 
  in democracies you choose everything , directly or indirectly . 
  in monarchies , you do n't . 
  monarchies are not democracies by definition . 
  it 's spare parts . 
  we 're in nato and have obligations to the alliance , dear anti-greek troll . 
  everything is taken into account in this table . 
  greece will rebound , starting from q3 2012 , mark my words . 
  there are many greeks in / r/europe that believe the same , despite their ideological differences . 
  if we believed the scaremongering crowd , the mayan prophecies would be true and we would be outside of the eurozone now . 
  nobel laureates and investors betting against greece lost . 
  i never did . 
  this is not only a greek problem , it 's a problem in every western country . 
  rich people have armies of lawyers and accountants , and can hide their money using various tricks . 
  one part of the problem is how to persuade countries like switzerland to be really transparent . 
  switzerland seems nice on the surface , but the country 's happiness depends on our misery . 
  regarding tax evaders in greece , you should know that many powerful people went to jail in 2012 . 
   supposedly glorious past supposedly ? 
  eryemil , a redditor transforming the global academic community . 
  know what is really pathetic ? 
  lecturing others while you 're having the same problems and you 're in the process of losing one or more of your regions . 
  that 's why the government in skopje should accept that : 1 ) macedonia is a wider geographic region , of which this country is only a part of 2 ) 2.5 m greeks identify themselves as macedonians vs 1.2 m on the other side that started to use this term fairly recently 3 ) ridiculous claims about the ancestry of these slavic people should stop , they have nothing to do with ancient macedonians 4 ) the revolutionary figures they perceive as macedonians , described themselves as bulgarians and sought autonomy for the region of macedonia , as the first step towards unification with bulgaria austrians get pissed over the name and the origin of a sausage , other nations have the right to get pissed over more important matters . 
  the students in this country think that there are lands under occupation by bulgaria and greece , and that they should take them back . 
  their manufactured history poisons them . 
  said the person from the racist country whose state tv claims that white people are `` macedonoids '' and these `` macedonoids '' will inherit the earth . 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammoqrej-6a said the person whose state asked for another loan , this time from the world bank . 
  http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/2013/01/08/world-bank-approves-eur-155-million-public-expenditure-policy-based-guarantee-macedonia go play elsewhere , troll . 
  the whole world is laughing with your nonsensical claims , you 're not chosen people and descendants of alexander the great , but ordinary people like the rest of us . 
  i remember these people trying to lecture other states they perceived as corrupt . 
   the typical thing is to meet people through mutual friends . 
  three options : 1 ) you are shy . 
  2 ) you live in a small city . 
  3 ) you live in a different country . 
  people meet other people everywhere . 
  for guys/girls that are at least capable of maintaining a clean and healthy image , it 's as easy as just opening their mouths . 
  do n't be shy . 
  the number of people feeding stories to mark lowen has become extremely small . 
   but as greece has become the main ** entry point for migrants ** to the eu , its muslim population has swelled . 
  caution , do not type the dreaded word : `` illegal '', 
  some accounts constantly post links from one-europe . info , which most of the time copies directly or reproduces content existing in other sites . 
  good report .
