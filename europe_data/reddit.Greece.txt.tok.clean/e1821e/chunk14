  please . 
  in this thread we 're having a ww1 artwork . 
  also , it is clear that op is affiliated with this site . 
  he 's even the moderator of / r/oneeurope . 
  sure . 
  with the eurozone crisis , more people are afraid of the eu . 
  asking for a referendum in this climate is suicidal and moronic . 
  but provided that the people of snp are not idiots , then what is left ? 
  are they complicit and want to burry the issue once and for all , resorting to some form of more devolution ?

  i know several people that are obsessed with different things . 
  they do n't get any free pass to a state job , or to any benefits at all . 
  i think that your system went too far , this is inexcusable .

  i support scotland 's independence . 
  however , i ask every person from scotland the same question : do you understand that a ) snp does n't really want full independence , and b ) snp fell into cameron 's trap with the timing of the referendum ? 
  in other words , do you understand that this is purely a play ? 
   delightful wit your sense of humour is not in top shape , because there is only one country covering the region of greece : greece . 
  there 's also another place that might help you understand why this matters : ireland . 
  the interim name fyrom was accepted by both sides , until a permanent solution is found . 
  it was a yugoslav federal republic , they accepted it , end of story . 
  appropriate username , however the issue did not come up during the last 2-3 years , and countries have more than one ministries in order to deal with different issues . 
  if you are interested in the background of the story , i 'd suggest paying attention to comments by people that try to provide you with information , instead of leaving comments like this one . 
  there are many sites with european content . 
  besides , one-europe . info frequently publishes content from other sites . 
  post their original content only . 
  i know where the map came from . 
  this has nothing to do with what i 'm asking . 
  i 'm asking for an official list . 
  their government refuses to publish the names of the countries that allegedly recognize their constitutional name . 
  they mention random numbers without actually disclosing the names . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  read this to understand what i 'm talking about : http://kurir.mk/en/2012/11/28/greece-to-censor-macedonias-name/  pertaining to macedonia 's recognition by third countries under its constitutional name , tsiaras says , ** `` very few un member-states '' have recognized macedonia under that name `` through exchange of verbal notes by permanent representatives of the countries in the un , even without informing their ministries of foreign affairs '' . 
  ** \u0399n other words , they 're lying . 
  i repeat my request . 
  i 'm paying ** anyone ** that will come up with an ** official ** list , with verifiable names that will ** match ** the current claimed number ( 135 ) . 
  ** i 'm serious . 
  i 'm going to be the unpleasant guy and say that although i appreciate most posts from one-europe . info , i think that you guys should stop doing this on a daily basis , because it 's on the verge of getting out of hand . 
  by they way , this image was posted many times in the past , in several subreddits . 
  the customer is not always right , or innocent . 
  the big fishes that had the largest share in their investing portfolios , knew very well what they were getting into . 
  regarding the workers , the lower ranked workers might be innocent , but the others are not . 
  they 're trained to sell things that they understand they 're problematic . 
  i 'm paying you to obtain and publish an official list with the names of these countries . 
  i 'm serious . 
  your ministry of foreign affairs declines to do so for years now . 
  the recognitions you 're thinking as `` official '' are * not * . 
  edit : typo ( recognition ** s ** ), 
  austrians get pissed over a sausage . 
  do n't you think that greeks and bulgarians have more serious reasons ? 
  * macedonia is a region . 
  half of this region belongs to greece , including the core territories of the ancient macedonian kingdom , which is academically accepted as a hellenic one . 
  half of the population of the region are greeks and identify themselves as macedonians . 
  * one quarter of the population of the region , speaking a slavic language that is very similar to bulgarian , started identifying themselves as `` ethnic macedonians '' fairly recently . 
  they started appropriating symbols and historic personalities of greece , bulgaria , and albania . 
  they do n't recognise themselves as `` some '' macedonians , but as `` the '' macedonians , and think that `` their '' territories and `` their '' history is `` distorted '' and `` stolen '' . 
  * given the fragile status of the wider region , a future change in balance of power between the bigger powers might use identity and minority issues to start conflicts . 
  forcing 2.5 m greeks to accept that 1.2 m people living in the smaller part of macedonia ( region ) are now the `` only '' macedonians ( just that , no identifier ) is a ) impossible , and b ) careless . 
  it 's not a case of admiration . 
  it 's a case of lunacy . 
  these people should get a grip , accept their past and be proud of it . 
   are you trying to perpetuate the myth of the lazy greek i 'm a very proud greek . 
  i accept no myths . 
  i also accept no excuses . 
   i 'm assuming you 're correct by implying that this situation could have been avoided if the mayor was more proactive . 
  then we agree !, 
   but the main point of this article still conveys a troubling scenario ... that fuel has gotten so expensive that the mayor had to appeal for government aid to begin with . 
  it 's a state school . 
  state school always receive government aid , when needed . 
  most schools did n't have any problems .

  the new planet is outside of the previous legal system 's jurisdiction . 
  we also invented the system of seisachtheia , when you were playing with ancient legos . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seisachtheia do n't forget to leave that attitude behind you .

  inverter all the way . 
  my samsung consumes 1.5 kwh and covers perfectly my 1b flat . 
  it only adds $ 15 - $ 20 to the electricity billl , let 's say roughly $ 50 for the winter . 
  using heating oil is absurd if you 're not connected to the natural gas network . 
  we greeks have an expression .

  the state has solutions . 
  the people in charge of these schools , which are tiny fraction of the schools in greece , should do their job properly . 
  other schools do n't have any problems . 
  is that one physical item ? 
  are you sport billy ? 
  not a wise thought , you will be ostracised by the survivors . 
  us greeks will have to carve the horse 's belly a bit , i hope that you do n't mind . 
  we have some plans , you know , now that we 're going au naturel and all in the new planet . 
  ** greece ** * best : feeling the weight of our history * worst : feeling the weight of our history the good thing is that we 're having 5 years of soul searching and then the only way is up . 
  i 'm just as old school as you are .
