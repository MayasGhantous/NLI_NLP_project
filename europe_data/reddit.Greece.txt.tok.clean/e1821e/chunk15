  i 'm going with plato 's republic . 
  when we 're chosen as dear leaders of the new world , we 'll be laughing at all these kids unable to charge and use their electronic devices . 
  good luck trying to fill that drive when the earth is going to explode . 
  also , good luck in using it . 
   spain 's low productivity is n't caused by the fact that `` spain is full of spanish people '' , but rather the fact that a big majority of the spanish workers are employed in small-to-medium sized companies of less than 50 workers in total . 
  this is one of the problems in greece too . 
  there are gazillions of small businesses , and sometimes it 's impossible to deal with the bureaucracy . 
  also , large businesses have armies of lawyers and can use all the dirty tricks to avoid paying taxes , usually by going offshore . 
  small businesses ca n't afford to do this and they 're paying much larger effective tax rates . 
  add the lower profit margin and you see why they 're fucked in the end . 
  it 's not the people , it 's the idiotic system . 
   fraudulent asylum seekers i will remember this when i see posts about blaming greece for the huge immigration wave coming to the eu via turkey . 
  if you do n't expect anyone playing nice , do n't you see the dangers of going down that route ? 
  there are many examples from history that advise against this . 
  it 's much more feasible to first find allies in europe , our neighbourhood , and then go down whatever road the citizens have voted for . 
  syriza 's mp claims that he was attacked by some people , allegedly saying to him that were members of golden dawn . 
  he did n't have a scratch . 
  also , golden dawn , who was holding a protest in a district far away from the place of the alleged attack , immediately sued him . 
  it 's one thing to be against golden dawn , and another to blame every single hooligan as a golden dawn member . 
   `` the survivor told coast guard authorities all the immigrants were from iraq and had paid about 2,000 dollars per head to be transported to the island , '' a police official said . 
  modern slavery , after `` liberating '' the middle east . 
  apart from a few bright exceptions , i see the german downvote brigade in action . 
  correction : they do n't really know that the eu does/is . 
  they see their media sensationalizing and overplaying stories such as the directive for eggs ' specifications ( which is there for a reason ) . 
  they are ignorant . 
  eurosceptics are profiting on their backs . 
  edit replying to all comments below . 
  * ignorance is not stupidity . 
  calm down . 
  * the eu is our neighbourhood . 
  our country is our house . 
  we take care of both . 
  both enhance our quality of life . 
  the eu allows us all to speak louder in the international scene . 
  * please , do yourself a favour and read about the euromyths . 
  many uk media and politicians should be ashamed . 
  they spread lies . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/blog/index_en.htm also read what 's in for you in the eu . 
  who the hell downvotes articles like this one ?? 
  enlargement commisioner , after 42:00 : it was greece that was driving that process , clearly . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?sitelang=en&amp;ref=90957 meaning that greece did not block anything . 
  bulgaria did not block anything either , because the good neighbourly relations is one of the criteria . 
  there is no free pass in the eu , and it does n't matter how many years you wait . 
  if you do n't play by the rules , you do n't get in . 
  skopje has to understand that . 
  pissing your neighbours off with kitch statues of historical figures that do n't belong to your past does n't help . 
  irredentist speeches about a so-called `` united macedonia '' does n't help . 
  using national symbols of other states does n't help . 
  it 's really that simple . 
  the commissioner actually says that greece is the country driving that effort , and leaves many hints throughout the press conference that the other side should grab the opportunity or it will not get a date . 
  the journalist is preaching to the wrong choir . 
  take a seat and start reading . 
   no eu country has n't experienced mass immigration people that do n't live under a rock know that there are hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants from asia and middle east coming to greece via turkey . 
  there are also hundreds of thousands of immigrants from the balkans , mainly albanians . 
  all of these groups make more than 10 % of greece 's population . 
  no other eu country experiences anything like this , because they do n't have greece 's geographic location . 
  well , it is nice seeing turkey going back to its greek roots . 
  only a minority of modern turkey 's inhabitants are descendants of turkic tribes . 
  poland and serbia are superpowers , there are many wars in southern europe/middle east , with bulgaria trying to get an upper hand after it severed ties with its former alliance . 
  the debt will rise to about 190 % of the gdp . 
  with profits roughly 110 % of the gdp , it will definitely cover it . 
  these are government 's profits only , there are added benefits . 
  hundreds of thousands of jobs will be created , meaning that the government will not pay unemployment benefits and that consumers will spend money . 
  this will reduce the debt further , and the economy will grow very fast . 
  may i interest you with the faq ? 
  most of you do n't understand what this index is . 
  in practice , you are subjects . 
  you are citizens only in name . 
  just look at the oath/affirmation of allegiance for those becoming uk citizens . 
   oath of allegiance  i ( name ) swear by almighty god that on becoming a british citizen , i will be faithful and bear true allegiance to her majesty queen elizabeth the second , her heirs and successors , according to law . 
   affirmation of allegiance  i ( name ) do solemnly , sincerely and truly declare and affirm that on becoming a british citizen , i will be faithful and bear true allegiance to her majesty queen elizabeth the second , her heirs and successors , according to law . 
  one declares that will do whatever a specific family wants . 
  there 's your freedom . 
  you can see the development of the same root in different languages [ here ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/appendix:proto-indo-european/w%c3%a9y%e1%b8%b1s ) . 
  [ it is , in a way ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oeconomus ) , given that we first started to wrap our heads around the concept of managing household affairs and expanded upon that . 
  the spelling remains the same in greek , it 's the transliteration that makes it look different to non-greeks . 
  oikonomou ( \u039f\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 ) and economou are the same , the latter being the anglicized version . 
  economy is oikonomia ( \u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 ) in greek . 
  the - idis or - ides ( - \u03af\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2 ) ending is very common and many greeks of pontic ( black sea ) origin carry such surnames . 
  [ pontic greek is also really special . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucayp4irsyq ), 
  haha , good one !, 
  as a greek i did n't even think about that , economou , economides etc are generic surnames . 
  the point is about inhabited islands . 
  you do n't tax or give concessions to swallows or goats . 
  http://europeansmallislands.com/members/  ** croatia has 48 inhabited islands ** with a population of 122,418 ( 2001 ) . 
  the islands belong to the dalmatian regions dubrovnik , split , sibenik and zadar , to the kvarner region and to the istria region . 
   they are esin : s newest member ( joined 2014 ) and are represented by oto\u00e7ni sabor which is the croatian islands parliament , http://www.otocnisabor.hr/  ** in estonia there are 16 islands with a total of 47 000 inhabitants . 
  ** there are two big islands that are regional authorities . 
  the remaining 14 are the small islands with about 3 000 inhabitants ranging from 1 to about 500 . 
   the main purpose of the association of estonian islands , www.saared.ee , is to promote development and sustainable populations on the 16 islands . 
  greece has many more ** inhabited ** islands and most of them are far from the mainland . 
  croatian islanders still get concessions to save money and most of them live closer to the mainland . 
  the relative cost ( not in nominal value ) for greek islanders is higher . 
  geography called , she wants to know that you ca n't compare greece and croatia . 
  croatia is also a beautiful country but greece has 4x the number of inhabited islands and croatia 's islands are close to the mainland . 
  ours are not connected with bridges , some or yours are . 
  when i was there locals told me that they get cheaper tickets to travel there . 
  did you took notice of his expression when he saw the out of context edited bits with the may 2013 tag ? 
  would n't you be outraged ?
