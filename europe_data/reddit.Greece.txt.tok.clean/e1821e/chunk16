  can you predict your level of eloquency during a stressful situation ? 
  the man lost it and he explained it later . 
  jauch 's video was the doctored one he referred to . 
  but even when he lost it , it was clear to me that he did n't question the conference video ( `` that ** was ** footage from that conference '' ) . 
  he did n't mean that jauch 's editor used special effects to create a finger gesture . 
  the proof for that is that the audio would still be the same , so he would have said what he said . 
  it would n't change the argument . 
   misspoke i 've already said that . 
  to those familiar with the original video it was clear that he did n't lie when he said `` that was footage from that conference '' . 
  he just did n't explain it very well . 
  yup , that was the original finger incident . 
  it was the first insult , the first shot that started the war between german and greek media . 
  look , / u/naurgul is also greek . 
  we disagree politically on practically everything and he knows very well that i never supported syriza and that i have no reason to support this government and its ministers . 
  / u/gschizas is an / r/europe mod but is also an / r/greece mod and can confirm that . 
  i 'm just saying that to show you that i have no reason to whitewash varoufakis if he 's done something wrong . 
  there is now proof that varoufakis meant what i 've been trying to explain . 
  https://twitter.com/yanisvaroufakis/status/577598813050929153  and here is the ` undoctored ' by the unscrupulous media 's video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meuwxnifjj8 see ? 
  the original footage is undoctored . 
  the video jauch played is the doctored one . 
  it was not about questioning the original footage or whether his finger moved . 
  with `` finger '' he was talking about the finger * part * of * the video played in the show * . 
  the man can recite poetry in english but seeing jauch 's editors messing with the context made him lose his temper and he did n't explain what he meant very well . 
  the film-maker that shoot the footage also explains the context . 
   he very clearly denied it . 
  it would seem that way to me too , if he did n't say `` that was footage from that conference '' . 
  i did n't even vote for his party and i could n't care less about his public image . 
  but he is not an imbecile , he is tech-savvy and knows that dozens of people could have footage from that conference . 
  it would be absurd to claim that footage shot by one person is fake , because video from another one might emerge . 
  here 's what i got from the whole exchange . 
   that video was doctored !, 
  the video they played . 
   i never gave the finger . 
  i 've never given the finger ever . 
  he did n't , he was just demonstrating what would happen with greece defaulting in 2010 . 
   this was doctored , and i feel ashamed that i am part of a program which shows a video , i 'm sure you did n't know that , but let me assure you that i never pointed the finger . 
  it was a doctored video . 
  he is not sure if jauch saw the complete footage from the conference or if he was shown only the video they broadcast , he gives jauch the benefit of the doubt . 
   it is exactly the same way , there is another video doing the rounds in greece , where supposedly i am giving my hand to mr. dijsselbloem , and i am pulling it back . 
  he does n't claim video effects were used for the dijsselbloem video , he 's just saying that this too was made to give a false impression . 
   that was footage from that conference , but that , the finger , was doctored !, 
  in `` finger '' read `` part with the finger shown a few minutes ago on your show '' . 
   i can assure you . 
  i can prove this beyond reasonable doubt , and i wish that you could simply take it away . 
  it never happened . 
  what they made it out to be never happened . 
  not the gesture as a body move , the gesture presented to be varoufakis policy . 
   `` that video was doctored . 
  i 've never given the finger , i 've never given the middle finger ever . '', 
  which is true because he refers to the show 's video . 
  in the conference he talked about a hypothetical scenario in which greece defaulted in 2010 . 
  it would be like the government of greece giving the middle finger to germany 's government , as german banks would have to be bailed out directly by germany . 
  varoufakis as a citizen , was in no position to give the finger to anyone and never did . 
  also as a minister he never claimed giving germany the finger . 
  jauch said what , you want to give us the finger when we pay the most ? 
  that was a ridiculous question based on the non-existent situation presented in the doctored video . 
  of course the doctored video contains real footage which varoufakis did n't deny . 
   he doubled down by reiterating that it was `` doctored '' he did n't , he was frustrated and not as eloquent as he usually is but that was expected . 
  what jauch did was unacceptable . 
  nevertheless , [ varoufakis said to jauch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnpcqqphq9k#t=3m17s ) that the footage ** was ** taken from the conference but the video jauch played was doctored , which is true . 
  [ from the comments . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/16/greece-yanis-varoufakis-video-middle-finger-germany#comment-48987066 )  varoufakis says `` that video is doctored '' . 
  he refers to the video the german tv show broadcast . 
  jauch 's editors presented the 2013 footage out of context . 
   varoufakis does not question the footage . 
  there 's proof for that , because he also told jauch : ** `` that was footage from that conference , but that - the finger - is doctored '' ** . 
  in mentioning `` finger '' , he refers to the finger part of the video . 
   this is what really happens in the 2013 footage . 
  the part in question was taken from a q&a exchange and varoufakis talked about the months preceding the bailouts . 
  there were no loans for greece during that period . 
  varoufakis always argued that the path the eu followed would not stop the crisis from spreading . 
  given that germany said greece 's plight was an isolated incident and was adamant about not seeking another solution ( eurobonds etc ) , varoufakis said : `` my proposal was that greece should simply announce that it is defaulting -- just like argentina did -- within the euro in january 2010 and stick the finger to germany and say ` well , you can now solve this problem by yourself ' , right ? '', 
   in other words , varoufakis did not stick the finger to germany . 
  he argued that if greece hypothetically defaulted , germany would have to bail out its own banks , which also was n't ideal for them . 
   the german show edited ( `` doctored '' ) the conference footage and made varoufakis look like he was talking about the period following the bailouts . 
  the video they broadcast briefly displayed `` may 2013 '' . 
  the viewers heard varoufakis saying `` greece should simply announce that it is defaulting '' and `` and stick the finger to germany and say ` well , you can now solve this problem by yourself ' '' . 
   following the video , the presenter asked varoufakis about sticking the finger to germany , which pays the most . 
  but this is ridiculous , because the conference footage was edited and made to look completely out of context . 
  and this . 
   video = the video the german tv show broadcast yesterday  footage = the footage shot in 2013  the video contains 2013 footage reffering to 2010 . 
  varoufakis does n't question the 2013 footage . 
  he said the video broadcast during the live show was doctored . 
  they cut up his reply and put a `` may 2013 '' tag on it . 
  they made it look like it 's his current strategy , while he clearly referred to a hypothetical situation before greece receiving loans . 
   from the article \u0399 think that all german and greek redditors should take an oath about not believing anything at all before a cool-down period of 72 hours or so . 
  [ this is the supreme court decision . 
  ] ( http://www.areiospagos.gr/nomologia/apofaseis_display.asp?cd=g17is4nxuv0ztja16balv8eom4rld2&amp;apof=11_2000 ) there is no mention of '' \u03b9\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf '' ( institute ) or anything else pertaining to the article 's claims . 
  according to a greek skai tv journalist ( btw the station is considered german-friendly and has ties with dw ) with knowledge of the matter , ww2 veteran and mep [ manolis glezos ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/1654/emmanouil_glezos_home.html ) went to visit the justice minister of the time about the issue , with the decision in hand . 
  the minister said , well , i ca n't do anything about the decision because the justice system is independent , but these are the assets you could seize in theory . 
  goethe institute and the german archeological institute were among them . 
  glezos said no , these are the biggest [ philhellenes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philhellenism ) in the country , we could n't do that . 
  glezos and santas are the guys that risked their lives and tore down the nazi flag from the acropolis . 
  one way or another germany will acknowledge that it has to deal with the [ forced loan ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/10/germany-greece-second-world-war-reparations ) and individual claims from survivors in specific cases , these were not part of the settlement .

  it 's complicated as hell and involves the german state , which was represented in key stages . 
  transparency international is an ngo . 
  they receive funding from foundations that were set up by people with questionable business practices . 
  they 're doing polls using samples that are not representative , and their index is about perceptions .
