  there are many problems with their methodology . 
  even in first world countries , many businessmen do n't even considered those that bribe as being corrupt . 
  the majority ( 57 % ) did n't participate . 
  that 's his point ( `` if you do n't even participate in this process '' ) . 
  yes , i would agree . 
  i like threads like this one because we show our true colours . 
  `` united in diversity '' my ass . 
  fallmerayer 's shitty slavic theories and other politically motivated bullshit turkic theories from non-geneticists have been long superseded . 
  you mean that most modern turks are descendants of greeks and other nations , as turks were outnumbered when they arrived . 
  this process is called [ turkification ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkification ) . 
  read the research . 
   when in fact , i did . 
  lol , what were the chances !, 
  [ at least ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/liste_griechischer_wortst%c3%a4mme_in_deutschen_fremdw%c3%b6rtern ) [ you did n't ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/liste_griechischer_pr%c3%a4fixe ) [ study ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/liste_griechischer_suffixe ) [ linguistics ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/griechische_zahlw%c3%b6rter ) said the op . 
  in poetry everything looks better thought the op . 
  here 's mine . 
  czech women win the euroslut contest pants down . 
  belgium is a non-nation , glued together using bars of chocolates . 
  happy now ? 
   greeks and spanish are a lazy , uneducated http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/submitviewtableaction.do?dvsc=9 http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/education_statistics, 
  right , because germany is debt-free . 
  another greek verifying what other greeks wrote . 
  farmers ' pernions are ridiculously low and they 'll be cut too . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/santorini ) hurry , the volcano might wake up . 
  just kidding . 
   i noticed most of the people cited were from the pigs countries . 
  i hope you did n't study mathematics . 
  your language confuses and fascinates me . 
  you 'll always have essex 's duckfaces and poor stylistic choices to fall upon . 
  well , we had a great party in our lives , hopefully you enjoyed yourself too . 
  keep in mind that eu alone has 500 million people . 
  even 1 % is a lot . 
  just finished preparations , me and my friends are having a party . 
  ok , i admit that we 're a multinational bunch , including democrats abroad . 
  the most hardcore of us will stay up and watch stewart/colbert live . 
  my thoughts exactly . 
  i wonder if they 'll get more pasok members , they 're getting out of their sinking ship now . 
   he is considered responsible for tsipras ' `` nationalistic overtones '' lately haha , yes , it was fun to listen to tsipras talking about fyrom 's irredentism !, 
   proto thema is a very populist newspaper . 
  all other newspapers and media wrote the same . 
   first , let 's think about it rationally . 
  would a politician ever say his party is not ready to govern , even if he believed it deep down ? 
  what he would do is , he would raise the issue internally . 
  it is not rational to suggest that an honest politician like lafazanis would lie or avoid to discuss this in front of cameras , but would discuss about their inability internally . 
   by the way , lafazanis has also made an announcement claiming that his quote was taken out of context . 
  that was expected . 
  some nitwits in his party think that governments are playgrounds . 
  they did not like what he said . 
  if you read his announcement carefully , he still does n't say explicitly that they are ready to govern now . 
  they did this because of the rise of golden dawn , get a grip . 
  we all know what day it was . 
  that 's the point of doing it in the parade , jesus . 
  i saw that earlier on facebook . 
  it 's in [ keratsini ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/keratsini ) , one of the poorest areas . 
  i 'm very proud of them . 
  that woman is their professor . 
  yes , despite the negative answers of the americanized european redditors . 
  even german sweet-talk sounds like you 're murdering someone . 
   we have no freedom of speech . 
  \u03a5ou 're writing this from the trenches ? 
  have you been to a kiosk recently ? 
  there are magazines and newspapers about fucking anything , no matter the degree of craziness or seriousness . 
   we even have a government we never elected . 
  welcome to fucking reality : there were two elections recently . 
   if you 're not 100 % greek , 100 % white , 100 % orthodox christian , you simply have no rights in this country and nobody gives a crap about you . 
  if you 're not a criminal or someone that broke the law by entering the country illegally , you have no problems . 
  for fucks sake , even golden dawn takes in albanians . 
   riots are all over athens since 2008 this happens 2-3 times a year around syntagma . 
  who starts the riots ? 
  a bunch of self-styled `` anarchists '' that have no clue what anarchism really is . 
   members of the golden dawn are searching in kindergardens for kids not being greek and ask for their teachers to not teach these kids . 
  members of golden dawn are imbeciles , but they do n't do that . 
  hard downvote . 
  on a related note , greek leftists of / r/europe , you 've gone over the top recently . 
  i 'm with you on social matters , but take deep breaths before posting . 
  greece is good business for media . 
  even these german analysts know that the risk is too high . 
  that 's their conclusion . 
   hence it is incumbent upon the community of nations to prevent greece from a sovereign default as well as leaving the euro , and the domino effect that this event could induce . 
  i 'd like to see germany 's ( random choice ) reaction if 10 million people tried to cross the border illegally . 
  that 's the analogy with the number of illegal immigrants trying to enter greece -- basically , the eu . 
  how many people should germany have to take care of this matter properly ? 
  i ' l tell you what : no country can deal with it alone . 
  most of these people are not refugees . 
  they claim to be refugees in order to be accepted under that status , because it has benefits they lie about their country of origin and their age . 
  their embassies ca n't verify shit . 
  people here often joke that we have more palestinians than gaza . 
  immigrants know that greeks like palestinians and so claim that they are from there . 
  on the other hand , turkey , greece 's archenemy , knows that such large numbers destroy the social cohesion and are a burden to the state , that 's why it does n't care about turkish slave traders and their border patrols pretend they do n't see anything . 
  it 's too easy to put the blame on one side without knowing the whole story and understanding the real conditions . 
  the west starts wars and then conveniently puts the blame on the countries near eu 's external border ? 
  laughable . 
  let 's see you campaigning to share the burden . 
  let 's see you campaigning to scrap dublin ii . 
  then we 'll talk about it . 
   this guy has no official function , so i do n't know where his insight comes from . 
  i presume from being a professor of economics , considered good enough to be selected for the council of the wise economists that advise the german government , where he served for 14 years , with 2 as a chairman . 
  in other words , from being more qualified than us . 
  i still do n't understand why an islamist party wants turkey to join the eu . 
  the only excuse i can find is the kurdish issue , if turkey believes that eu membership would keep the country intact .
