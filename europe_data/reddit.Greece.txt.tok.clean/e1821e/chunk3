  what pm says is that there are many extreme views in the country , from different groups . 
  this is the typical knee-jerk reaction from the leftist opposition and the new populist media associated with it . 
  no one can make anything `` disappear '' in this day and age . 
  discussions about the next tranche are always paused and restarted because this is the nature of negotiations everywhere . 
  it does n't really matter now because the next tranche is small . 
  not to mention that it is crazy to see people against the loans raising this matter . 
  former rectors and the majority of students and parents are against the decision , say that current rectors play political games with the opposition . 
  opposition tries to create an autumn of discontent in order to gain popularity , as 2013 is the last year of recession and greece 's economy will start growing again . 
  in effect , naurgul writes what the party newspaper of the opposition publishes . 
  he is also noted for doing the same in / r/greece . 
  anyone should have this in mind when reading his comments . 
  yeah , let 's all go home , back to africa . 
  method77 is right . 
  it 's easy for golden dawn to fade into oblivion . 
  this was purely a protest vote . 
  granted , there are people with extreme views in greece , as in all countries . 
  but if you look at golden dawn 's electoral percentage in the previous elections , when the economy was doing better , you 'd realise that golden dawn is formed around a very small core of extremists . 
  in 2009 they got less than 20,000 votes . 
  that 's more than twenty times less that what they got three years later . 
  http://ekloges-prev.singularlogic.eu/v2009/pages/index.html?lang=en  laikos syndesmos - chrysi aygi 0.29 % 19,624 ** tl ; dr ** it was a `` fuck you '' vote ; rushed , yes , stupid , yes , but nothing more than that, 
  take that , macedonoids !, 
  there was no greece the way we mean it today . 
  there were several greek states and kingdoms that were fighting between them for supremacy . 
  they knew however that they are of the same stock , and had the same core culture . 
  greek , in every sense of the word . 
  indeed , apart from a tiny part now beloning to our northern neighbour . 
  all ancient capitals and important sites were and are within greece , macedonians spoke a northern greek dialect , they worshipped the same gods etc. 
  it was not on air , the station broadcast this instead of the correct clip . 
  not that cursing is a big deal , this is very common with public figures . 
  he just told something like `` fuck my head , asshole '' , as he was tired and could n't finish his sentence properly . 
  they 're just hosting the video . 
  what matters is what the french said . 
   mass immigration to nordic countries please . 
  take a look at the map . 
  the south is at a disadvantage here . 
   the uk will require the agreement of the eu 's 26 other members to be able to re-adopt selected measures . 
  27 and [ good luck ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/9821405/france-would-roll-out-the-red-carpet-for-uks-exit-from-eu.html ) . 
  she knew . 
  if you care do n't vote for her . 
  do you realize that is not an announcement from the competent authorities ? 
  data from the competent authorities show that even according to the revised statistics greece had a lower deficit than other countries joining the eurozone at the same time . 
  http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/2012/apr/26/greece-europe-north-south-divide  the revised state deficit figures in the critical year ( 1999 ) became 3.1 % of gdp against 2.5 % of gdp previously . 
  the precise figure was actually 3.07 % , according to eurostat ( ameco ) . 
  this deficit is still lower than the equivalent revised deficits of other member states that were assessed on the basis of 1997 statistics , and which formed the first wave of member states that created the euro area in 1999 . 
  the ameco website shows that many other member states entered the euro area with state deficits that were higher than 3.1 % of gdp . 
  but there is little public reference to this fact , even though many of these now manifest similar problems to greece . 
  plot twist : assange put it there . 
  i do n't know , are you willing to follow the old testatement to the letter ? 
   read this , this and this about the emergency executive decrees . 
  did you even listen to the amagi show ? 
  i did , when it was broadcast live !, 
  there were * many * different legal opinions and most of them were not as clear cut as you think they were . 
  message @sotiropoulos on twitter for more . 
   he also says he disagrees with the closure . 
  ** he says that he disagrees with the ** way ** it closed down ( ** \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc ** \u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03c3\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf ) . 
  this means that he disagrees with deliverin\u03b3 an ultimatum a few hours before closing . 
  i agree with dimou . 
  before that , he spend a whole paragraph explaining why restructuring with ert functioning is practically impossible . 
  after that , he says that there is no easy solution . 
   undemocratic procedures that bypass the parliament are okay then you do n't know how the state works . 
  it 's the same with some imbeciles in the opposition , which take advantage of people 's ignorance . 
  it will come to parliament . 
  here 's another `` undemocratic measure '' . 
   he nowhere says it 's necessary . 
  he says that the outcome of a restructuring with ert functioning would be a strike for months to come . 
  he also says that there would be no easy solution to the problem . 
  it 's a polite way to say `` ugly but necessary '' . 
   `` someone has to make a start '' so whatever they do you 'll justify it ? 
  i wo n't justify beatings . 
   the link you sent me says that `` a deep restructuring is needed but shutting down ert is wrong '' . 
  it does n't say that . 
  it says `` ugly but necessary '' . 
  because someone , somewhere has to make a start . 
  this would be impossible with ert functioning as normal . 
  read this . 
   at any rate , even if what you say is true , that 's still 55 % laid off . 
  they will hire more people as needed . 
  anyway , many of them would n't see their contracts renewed , so it 's better to leave now with compensation . 
   if the orchestras are not downsized that means that maybe journalists will take an even greater hit in their numbers . 
  there are many specialties in ert , not only journalists . 
  ther is excess administrative personnel , hired by the parties using the analogy 4:2:1 . 
  these have to go . 
   do you have any evidence to support the claims that there is an excess number of `` so-called '' journalists ? 
  ert has more journalists than other channels , according to several publications . 
  many of them were hired by the parites to present the party lines . 
  do n't make it like you discovered ert yesterday , when suddenly everyone and their cat fell in love with hadjidakis . 
  it makes me sad and angry that we bother with meaningless things in the face of much more significant issues . 
  1200 out of 2656 is 45 % . 
  there are going to be external contractors as well . 
  yesterday i 've read [ malcolm brabant 's adventure ] ( https://www.amazon.co.uk/kindle/dp/b00cvyxxzc ) . 
  he was bbc 's correspondent in athens for many years , but not as a permanent employee . 
  bbc has thousands of people working like that . 
  orchestras are not going to be touched . 
  if you were familiar with orchestras you 'd know that you ca n't reduce the number of e.g. 
  violinists by 55 % . 
  it does n't work that way . 
  ert is obviously bloated and we are all to blame . 
  not the way pangalos means it . 
  do n't defend the undefendable , it 's like some people woke up one day and loved classical music . 
  please .
