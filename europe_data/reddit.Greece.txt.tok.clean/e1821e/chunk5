  it does n't have to be like that , complete transparency will give focus to what matters in the end : a good product . 
  the prime minister went there to welcome him !,

  while they know that they do owe the money , this would be a political suicide for any german government . 
  let me tell you what they 'll do instead . 
  within a couple of years , they 'll offer debt reduction to greece , provided that greece will never raise the matter again . 
  it 's the only way to save face and ensure that others wo n't follow . 
  more than 800 comments in the german edition . 
  you need a strong stomach to read some of them .

  http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/economic-historian-germany-was-biggest-debt-transgressor-of-20th-century-a-769703.html  spiegel online : you 're saying that germany should back down ? 
   ritschl : in the 20th century , germany started two world wars , the second of which was conducted as a war of annihilation and extermination , and subsequently its enemies waived its reparations payments completely or to a considerable extent . 
  no one in greece has forgotten that germany owes its economic prosperity to the grace of other nations . 
   spiegel online : what do you mean by that ? 
   ritschl : the greeks are very well aware of the antagonistic articles in the german media . 
  ** if the mood in the country turns , old claims for reparations could be raised , from other european nations as well . 
  and if germany ever had to honor them , we would all be taken the cleaners . 
  compared with that , we can be grateful that greece is being indulgently reorganized at our expense . 
  if we follow public opinion here with its cheap propaganda and not wanting to pay , then eventually the old bills will be presented again .

  all is well , at least they 're not russians . 
  [ hm fort roughs .

  downvoting has become ridiculous in / r/europe . 
  people use it in order to promote their agendas . 
  they constantly bury informative articles before they get noticed . 
  this is disgusting . 
  this article had 4 dowvotes in an hour and only 3 people commented on it . 
  ** downvoting does not mean `` i disagree '' with the author 's view . 
  from the perspective of german , greek , portuguese and other people living in poverty : the eu is masturbating like a blind guy with tremors , during the last 3 years . 
  dude , do n't worry , the angels of catharsis will clean our yurop . 
  these orthodox slavs dared to do what is allowed in the free market !, 
  but cyprus is so last year , they do n't even speak german . 
  russians should try luxembourg , switzerland and liechtenstein . 
  it 's closer to frankfurt , and ecb allows it . 
  right , being rich is wrong only if you have a slavic background , how did i forget . 
  as for the sources , there is none . 
  people should quit parroting whatever they can google . 
  the * ultimate * source for * all * the articles you 're posting is a report by the german secret services . 
  this report ended up in the german parliament and the government was forced to adopt its `` findings '' because the opposition gave them a hard time about allowing tax evasion in the eu . 
  that was a stupid argument , because these alleged russian oligarchs ( 10 ? 
  would have to pay tax in russia . 
  but who the fuck cares , everything stupid is allowed a few months before the elections . 
   uk is the only country that has a ftt ** for the uk ** , not for the eu . 
   as long as luxembourg does n't need eu taxpayers money ... they are okay to do ** whatever . 
  ** i do n't understand this kind of logic . 
  so there is no problem with countries having low corporate tax rates and inflated banking sectors , if these countries are located next to germany and there are no russian depositors ? 
  that 's hypocrisy . 
  it 's like saying `` yeah guys , do whatever you want , we like you more than others '' . 
  supposedly the eu money are needed because a large finance sector is not sustainable for smaller countries . 
  is germany going to give free passes when there are german depositors , as in the case of ireland , which has a larger banking sector compared to its gdp than cyprus ? 
  dude , provide some context . 
  i had no idea and looked around to understand what was that about . 
  [ things like that do n't end well . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sick_man_of_europe#origin ), 
  then you realize how idiotic is when german media present some idiots as representing greece . 
  ** i ** am clueless ? 
  this is wtf worthy . 
  have you heard of a thing called interest ? 
  call the austrian finance minister , she 'll be happy to explain to you how creditors make a profit . 
  read the official statement again . 
  also , have you heard that cyprus is a different state ? 
  first of all , cyprus gave loans to greece , ** as a state ** , during the `` bailout '' programs . 
  second , the cypriot state does n't need a `` bailout '' for itself . 
  it needs cheaper loans than what the markets are offering , because two large cypriot banks are facing problems . 
  if these banks collapse the state will have to take over . 
  these cypriot banks had to forgive 6 billions during the greek psi program . 
  6 billions is the exact amount that cyprus has to find from the bank restructuring and the levy on deposits . 
  in addition , the cypriot economy lost 3 billions from the explosion in mari . 
  add all the amounts above . 
  we 're in the tune of 10 billions , which is the ** exact ** amount the eu , the ecb and the imf are giving cyprus now . 
  yours , clueless, 
   their debt was mostly written off ( 74 % ) but they can not afford to pay one percent of it back , ever . 
  sorry , but not even 1 % of what you 're saying is true . 
  it is very unfortunate that the same myths are repeated here , despite being debunked again and again . 
  private investors with older greek bonds were asked to exchange them with new ones . 
  many of them have bought these older greek bonds at a fraction of their face value . 
  simply put , they exchanged a paper saying `` in a few years greece will give you $ 105 , because you gave greece $ 100 '' , a paper which they 've bought for $ 25 , with another one saying `` take back $ 20 of the $ 25 you 've paid for this , and we 'll give you $ 10 more in a few years , forget about the $ 105 '' . 
  ** other countries were not involved in this procedure , it was only about private investors . 
  this deal only took care of a part of the debt . 
  ** as for the paying back part , it seems that you 're not aware that other eu countries make a profit out of the ** loans ** . 
  finance ministers made it very clear . 
  greece is ** already ** making scheduled payments to other countries . 
  even the revised deals are profitable for creditors . 
  as an example , read this . 
  http://english.bmf.gv.at/press/releases_2012/february/269d6e00b5584725b2a60fbd9dd51b36.htm  following marathon negotiations by eu finance ministers on the second greek bailout package totalling eur 130 billion , austrian finance minister dr. maria fekter does not see the package as placing any additional financial burden on austria . 
  `` to the contrary : this agreement is significantly better for austria !, 
  ** the ecb will disburse the profits it receives from restructuring the greek bonds to the eu state banks . 
  for austria , this will mean significant volume , in the hundreds of millions . '' ** as for your other insulting remarks , there is no need to respond . 
  austerity works in good times . 
  that 's why it worked in germany and it did n't in other countries , which will need debt relief next year . 
  we do n't really need such provocative nonsense . 
   there were nazi comparisons in the greek media long before the focus title came out you are wrong .
