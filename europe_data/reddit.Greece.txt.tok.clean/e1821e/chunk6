  krattr is right . 
  focus came out months before the `` first greek bailout '' , while greece still had market access . 
  then the idiot tragas had to `` reply '' by presenting merkel as a nazi in crash magazine . 
   obviously the other protestors do n't seem to mind were you there ? 
  how do you know ? 
  really , that 's a poor argument . 
  more than 99 % of the people do n't do such things . 
  it is n't because they do n't bother , but because they do n't want to . 
  they can complain for the minority doing silly things , but they ca n't force them to stop . 
  it might be tasteless , but there 's nothing they can do . 
  we 're not in north korea . 
  ehm , no . 
  http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/18/germany-debt-savings-idusl6n0cadh020130318  germany will save at least 15 billion euros over the coming decade thanks to its `` safe haven '' status among investors fleeing the euro zone debt crisis , which has driven down berlin 's borrowing costs , a leading german institute said on monday . 
  i know , i was just saying that there are national variants of the cyrillic alphabet ( from balkans to russia ) and that it 's not difficult to learn to distinguish between them . 
  2013 called , croatia is late . 
  get over it . 
  here 's my cure . 
  spend a few hours learning this script and its national variants . 
  it 's great fun . 
  even if you do n't know the languages , you 'll be able to read names and grasp a few words here and there . 
   the announcement does not threaten to cut cyprus off . 
  exactly . 
  it says no more money to insolvent laiki and boc , and that the sky is blue . 
  not to mention that before the announcement , people in cyprus ( politicians and bankers ) said that they 're working on ironing out the final legal details of a plan that is going to be announced before monday . 
  if it were n't for the election frenzy in germany , we would n't witness this mess . 
  what is this , a hit piece thinly veiled as a balanced analysis ? 
  nah , probably not , these things do n't happen . 
  there is nothing obvious , one has to prove everything . 
  wealth is not an `` obvious '' sign of dirty money . 
  if they evade tax in russia , that 's not eu 's business but russia 's . 
  switzerland is first . 
  http://www.financialsecrecyindex.com/2011results.html germany , uk , belgium , austria , are also more secretive than cyprus . 
  indeed , it 's awful . 
   bank accounts of russian tax-evading oligarchs ? 
  cyprus ' is give us some proof . 
  oh , wait , there is none . 
  not even germany can find any sources . 
  if some people do n't pay taxes in russia that 's russia 's problem , not cyprus ' , uk 's , or latvia 's . 
   cyprus has initiated a count-down to leaving the currency but wo n't . 
  germany leaving is more possible , although it also wo n't happen . 
  the data nailed it . 
  somehow , germany finds nothing wrong about luxembourg 's banking sector , which is way bigger . 
  cyprus ( basically , cyprus ' banks ) would not need any help , if it were n't forced to accept a cut on greek bonds . 
  there are official statements from cyprus , posted here , spilling the beans about what happened in the eurogroup meeting . 
  following the statements , the eurogroup was forced to hold an emergency meeting using video-links , and issued a newer statement saying that they 're good guys and it 's up to cyprus to decide what to do . 
   rumours range from angela merkel to angela merkel , the only person playing hardball because she 's up for re-election . 
  it ended , they rejected the plan .

   after that there would be little option but to exit the euro and print print print . 
  cyprus wo n't exit the eurozone , no matter what route is chosen . 
  there are alternatives , radical or not , inside the eurozone . 
  some details were revealed [ here ] ( http://translate.google.gr/translate?sl=el&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=el&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.stockwatch.com.cy%2fnqcontent.cfm%3fa_name%3dnews_view%26ann_id%3d169903&amp;act=url ) . 
   `` this quasi-expropriation of investors would not only endanger the banking system in cyprus , but would be a threat to the financial system in the whole euro area , '' said the member of the advisory council on the assessment of economic development of the `` passauer neue presse '' ( monday ) . 
  `` that needs to be revised , otherwise it would have disastrous consequences . 
  the euro crisis would be re-tightened , and it would cost europe a multiple of what it is now believed to be able to save by the participation of savers in cyprus , `` bofinger said . 
   with the participation of investors on eu aid package for cyprus would `` torn the second load bearing wall of the european financial system , '' the expert said . 
  in october 2010 , the full security of european government bonds were called into question . 
  since government bonds are no longer safe . 
  `` this now applies to the deposits of savers . 
  this is the second taboo , `` said bofinger . 
  `` there is a risk that the savers are uncertain in other countries and leave their accounts . '', 
  the expert expects that the images of the people in front of the locked atms have psychological consequences on the development of markets . 
  `` here comes a lot of trust . '', 
   bofinger contradicted finance minister wolfgang sch\u00e4uble ( cdu ) , who sees the worst of the euro crisis overcome . 
  `` we are in the midst of the crisis . 
  we have a recession in the euro zone and a very significant recession in the problem countries . 
  there 's even still no turnaround . 
  `` stabilize cyprus , without the private investors to participate because there would have been in his view better . 
   somehow i do n't think the eu would agree to this , even if cyprus did . 
  then the masks will be off . 
  it would not be about the economy , but about brining the country down for the benefit of other corporate and banking destinations . 
  solidarity my ass . 
  lie no 1 :  but those who did not want a bail-in were the cypriot government , also the european commission and the ecb , they decided on this solution and they now must explain this to the cypriot people . 
  \u0399t was a ** eurogroup ** decision . 
  eurogroup 's members are the 17 finance ministers of the eurozone countries . 
  he is one of them . 
  cyprus ' president said that the decision had already been made , and that they did n't have any choice . 
  lie no 1 :  schaeuble said the cypriot business model , of attracting capital with low taxes and favorable legal regulation , had proven to be unsustainable . 
  it was perfectly sustainable until the moment that germany insisted on cutting the value of old greek bonds in half . 
  germany did not ask for this in the case of ireland , as german banks were more exposed there . 
  cyprus ' banks took a heavy hit . 
  clearly , some portuguese plumber is to blame . 
  the did n't let them to continue doing business as usual . 
  they failed in their previous form . 
  i found the video . 
  the article is not clear enough . 
  german redditors : what did these guys do and why are they worse than other guys nominated in the past , talking about drugs , bitches etc ? 
  do they want an independent south tyrol and germany thought italy would be mad ? 
  it started with a cup of tea . 
  some were n't invited . 
  if the media gear up for the ad hominem , instead of questioning the banks and multinationals advertising on them , then you know that grillo really is the most dangerous man in europe . 
  at least he is a democratically chosen one . 
  if you plan well in advance , you may find cheap tickets to and from athens for $ 100 . 
  i must stress the `` well in advance '' part . 
  you can find such cheap tickets with easyjet and ryanair . 
  as an example , for september i still see tickets for $ 150 with easyjet from london to athens and back . 
  add $ 50 for cheap ferry tickets and transport from and to the airport . 
  we 're left with $ 300 . 
  for two friends or a couple , than means they have $ 600 to spend over 20 days . 
  there are many islands where you could rent rooms from locals for $ 20 per day ( $ 400 in total ) .
