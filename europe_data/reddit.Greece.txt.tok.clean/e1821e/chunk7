  add $ 10 for groceries per day and we just reached our $ 500 per person limit . 
  now , if you 're more adventurous and would n't mind to use licensed campings , you could shave off $ 5 per day from your budget . 
  that 's enough for a couple of beers or a bottle of ouzo . 
  remember , we 're on a budget here and could n't care less about paying for overpriced drinks or facilities . 
  it 's nature what matters . 
  regarding specific recommendations , i do n't know where you 'll be flying from , where you want to go , and how long you want to stay . 
  are you visiting alone ? 
  try this version , the basic ideas are there . 
  as a heads up to european women . 
  there are people without many travel experiences that could benefit from such information . 
  also , the dialogue might generate some ideas about what we can do to push for changes . 
  you may find a $ 500 ticket , but that 's about it . 
  for $ 500 , you can easily spend 3 weeks on an unspoiled picturesque greek island and avoid tourist traps . 
  i agree with most of [ this ] ( http://varoufakis.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/modest-proposal-3-0-may-2012-without-rebalancing-mechanism.pdf ) plan 's ideas . 
  you may start with page 5 of the pdf . 
  i 'm having a hard time to understand the argument about alleged russian tax evasion . 
  following that logic , they transfer * much * larger amounts of money in other countries ( uk , switzerland , luxembourg , liechtenstein ) . 
  is it perfectly legal then ? 
  it is clear that some countries were after cyprus ' business advantages . 
  spain is also recapitalizing its banks , but they did not sign any ridiculous deals like this one . 
   they 'll bail out another irresponsible government allow me . 
  * merkel to private investors : take a cut on greek bonds * cypriot banks with greek bonds : goodbye , half of our money * merkel to the rest of the eu : ok , that was awkward , let 's not do this again * cypriot banks with greek loans : have fun chasing those that ca n't pay you back because their salaries were cut in half * cypriot savers : well , this is awkward iceland 's president said : let banks fail . 
  i agree . 
  they could split savings from loans , create a `` bad '' bank and allow it to fail . 
  they did n't . 
  i 'm reading cypriot newspapers right now and they talk about being blackmailed by asmussen ( german , serves on the board of ecb ) . 
  before the `` deal '' , he called draghi and told him to prepare for the collapse of two cypriot banks in a couple of days ( ecb would cut them off ) . 
  president 's statement in full : http://www.cyprus.gov.cy/moi/pio/pio.nsf/all/c7131da40fce0827c2257b30005411d5?opendocument, 
  i did n't put anything , it is bbc 's title . 
  it means that they quote the indian police . 
  you 're comparing apples and oranges . 
  it was much cheaper to produce goods in former communist countries , that 's why many businesses moved and are still based there . 
  as always , they will move out when they find better opportunities . 
  the same happened with greek businesses , as they moved to bulgaria and elsewhere . 
  also , different economies have different strengths . 
  greece has roughly four times more international tourist arrivals than germany ( most populous eu country ) , per capita . 
  greece had the biggest growth rate in international trade from 2010 to 2011 ( 39.2 % ) .

  in greek because fuck it . 
  we 're all going to be downvoted by the teenager hordes . 
  context in the table . 
  dates , tribes , places , sources . 
  will dig up some photos , i 'll have some 5th century sclavenes to e-mail me . 
  who had the brilliant idea of the psi ? 
  oh , right , it was merkel . 
  she forced private investors to take a cut on greek bonds . 
  cypriot banks were forced to accept it , and this started the cypriot banking crisis . 
  cyprus would be ok without being involved in this idiotic plan . 
  this is not an anti-german rant , it 's an anti-merkel rant . 
  she admitted the mistake indirectly , after saying that a psi wo n't happen for other `` bailed out '' ( my ass ) countries . 
  i 'm sorry for german taxpayers that have been deceived again . 
  this happened in india , but i posted this more as a note to women travelers from europe . 
  some countries have * real * issues with women . 
  travel agencies and media paint an idyllic picture , but you should be * very * careful . 
  it 's better to avoid going to places where women are not respected . 
  i know that there are countries in europe that have some issues too , but the situation is nowhere near what it is in india . 
  if you want to go there , always travel in groups . 
  according to most definitions , it 's in southern europe geographically and in western europe culturally . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_europe http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_europe, 
   here a video about organizing these meetings that was extremely interesting , thank you . 
  proto thema is a newspaper . 
  many newspapers do that in order to avoid copying by other media . 
  i just uploaded the album to imgur because i 'm not profiting from the photos and it would be easier for redditors to browse . 
   ethnically cleanse * sigh * there were wars ( practically everyone against everyone else ) and population transfers . 
  an example . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greeks_in_bulgaria#history  following the anti-greek tensions in bulgaria in 1906 and the population exchange agreements kalfov-politis and mollov-kafandaris after world war i , the bulk of the greek-speaking population in bulgaria was forced to leave for greece and was substituted by bulgarians from western thrace and greek macedonia . 
  the cemetery is located [ here ] ( http://wikimapia.org/15232020/greek-military-cemetery-ww1 ) . 
  this new provocation comes days after a consul general [ posted a map representing the so-called `` united macedonia '' on facebook ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1a2r37/consul_general_amon_bajramovski_provokes_greece/ ) . 
  this is far from a direct comparison , please read the report . 
  but even if you wanted to look at it that way , you would only find that iif 's argument is reinforced : the country with more problems should have less harsher adjustment . 
  their point is that while it would be easier for ireland to rebound , ireland had it easier . 
  not easy , but much easier . 
   three years into europe 's crisis , and with output falling in italy , spain and portugal , the different experiences of ireland and greece are instructive . 
  ** more tempered fiscal consolidation has helped ireland restart growth and bond issuance , while harsher adjustment in greece has contributed to a sharp reduction in gdp , elevating debt ratios and reinforcing doubts about creditworthiness . 
  ** no shit , sherlock . 
  given that many in / r/europe complained about racism recently , it seems a bit far-fetched for a new user to post something like that . 
  inconsistencies in the way you express yourself amplify this idea . 
  obvious troll is obvious . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_macedonia  united macedonia ( macedonian : \u041e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0430 , obedineta makedonija ) is an irredentist concept among ethnic macedonian nationalists that aims to unify the transnational region of macedonia in southeastern europe ( which they claim as their homeland and which they assert was wrongfully divided under the treaty of bucharest in 1913 ) , into a single state under slavic domination , with the greek city of thessaloniki ( solun in the slavic languages ) as its capital . 
  i 'm not sure if it was a news report or a documentary , but i remember vividly a scene with a bulgarian taxi driver saying that `` in 10 years we will be like miami '' , while other passers-by agreed . 
  that was after bulgaria 's eu entry . 
  really , mods , you should be more careful with these things . 
  i 'm saying this as greek seeing another greek being a mod . 
  oh , you and your logic !, 
  video here . 
  oh , look , another ignoramus trying to make a story out of nothing . 
  class warfare with a red skins sauce . 
  i guess the stories about a military junta are so pass\u00e9 now . 
  since when the principle of good-neighbourly relations was inserted in the conclusions of the council of the eu in 2009 . 
  that nationalist-kitsch amalgam is a no go . 
  making citizens believing that others stole their history , their heritage , and even their territories is not helpful . 
  it does n't matter , eventually they will join . 
  i would like to see abolition of national armies . 
  a unified eu army would be cheaper and better-equipped . 
  it would also enforce the sense of belonging to a community , toning down tensions . 
   we get only bestest and smartest foreigners but is n't this true ? 
  the `` internal '' migration pattern to germany is better for germany than the `` external '' migration pattern for countries receiving refugees and asylum seekers from africa , middle east , and asia . 
  i 'm sure some will label this as a racist comment , but it has nothing to do with the rights of `` external '' immigrants . 
  it 's the reality . 
  most europeans are better educated and germany has needs .
