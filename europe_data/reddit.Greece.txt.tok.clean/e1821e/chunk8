  it 's not exactly rocket science to predict what will happen . 
   but let me ask you this : would you buy made in greece or made in china ? 
  definitely made in greece . 
  i make a point to do so . 
  i always go out of my way to find greek products ( and businesses ) or european products when i 'm abroad . 
  in some instances , we ( not only greeks ) ca n't avoid to buy products made in china or made in taiwan . 
  for example , smartphones are ubiquitous today , but they are not made in europe , even if they are designed in europe ( or in the us ) . 
  there is also a greek company designing smartphones , which are accompanied by custom software for greeks , but the manufacturing is done in asia . 
  it 's the unfortunate situation we find ourselves today . 
  i would love to buy hardware 100 % made in europe . 
   unfortunately the powers that be seem either ill convinced by the corruption , embezzlement and evasion you reference , or aware greece wo n't create a significant ` economic miracle ' if her debt is cancelled that 's like saying `` once a nazi , always a nazi '' . 
  no , i do n't believe it for the germans , i do n't believe it for greeks too . 
  you are constantly bombarded with negative viewpoints , from speculators masked as independent economists and journalists that have n't even set foot on greece . 
  one photo of poor people grabbing fruits given for free puts a shade over the efforts of thousands of young greeks working their asses off , setting up new technology-oriented businesses and striving for the better . 
  there will be a time when other countries will fail ( again ) . 
  as a greek , i will not stand in a corner and talk shit about them . 
  if they choose to do so today , that 's their problem . 
  i 'm literally supporting this . 
  i 'm not in that position , but i have friends and relatives scattered all over greece , facing such difficulties . 
  i also have extensive knowledge of the country , as i lived in many different places from my birth until my graduation from the university . 
  i lived in small and bigger islands , and in small and larger cities in the mainland , including athens and thessaloniki ( greece 's second city ) . 
  i also spend my holidays in villages . 
  for better or for worse , athens ' metropolitan area attracted 4 million people . 
  that 's more than a third of the country . 
  a policy of decentralization could work , but it needs money and money is tight right now . 
  so you 're still left with millions of people working already in athens . 
  rents are somewhat higher , but the figure i 've mentioned is not for a super studio , in the most expensive area , in the centre of the city . 
  it 's for a normal studio in a 20-30 year old building in a relatively cheap residential area . 
  this is valid for thessaloniki also . 
  now , for smaller cities , you could subtract roughly $ 50 , but you 'd have to move and find work there . 
  with 3 out of 10 people out of work , if you 're lucky enough to have work * now * you do n't move * anywhere * . 
  starting your own business in one of the smaller cities could work , but you need some initial capital . 
  banks rarely give loans right now and competition for the most viable business plans , in projects co-funded by the eu , is fierce . 
  ideally , i would like to see at least half a million people leaving athens and starting businesses in poorer regions of the country , but this is only doable in the long run . 
  in the meanwhile , people are left with what they 're left , which is not pretty . 
  the `` troika '' idea was to `` regain '' competitiveness by reducing workers ' salaries , but given that greece does not export as much as germany ( i believe the ratio between them is 3 to 1 ? 
  ) , it killed consumption . 
  this , in turn , killed other businesses offering goods and services , which ultimately increased unemployment and caused unrest . 
  that design was wrong from the start , there 's no point in offering some debt reduction after you 've exhausted the people . 
  it should happen from the start , it would be easier and cheaper for greeks and greece 's creditors . 
  we would have avoided these crazy nazi and lazy shit thrown all over the place . 
  there are such provisions in international law , as an ultimate measure . 
  you might want to read these also . 
  http://www.ohchr.org/en/issues/development/iedebt/pages/internationalstandards.aspx http://unctad.org/en/docs/osgdp20074_en.pdf http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/odious_debt, 
  read the book . 
  try to keep anything fragile out of reach though . 
   she has changed those viewpoints not necessarily . 
  the party failed to adhere to national and international standards about the treatment of women . 
  farage 's derogatory remarks * after * her departure are very telling . 
  let 's do some calculations for a single person over 25 . 
  * $ 250 for a cheap studio in athens * $ 5 per day for food . 
  this is the absolute minimum or else you will be malnourished and eventually rushed to the hospital . 
  * $ 45 for a monthly transport card . 
  you 're left with $ 5 to pay for other supplies and bills . 
  impossible . 
  you 'd need at least $ 100 more , and you 'd still pray to avoid anything breaking down . 
  you are just a troll constantly posting anti-greek comments . 
  i guess topix and `` macedoniantruth '' forums were n't enough for you , you needed another venue . 
  let me educate you about the cost of living . 
   political defection should trigger a byelection she is a m ** e ** p and was elected to represent the uk . 
  she went with ukip because it was the only party that could offer her a position in the european parliament at the time . 
  being a mep would allow her to continue to do what she had to do . 
  that woman was eu 's chief accountant and quit after uncovering endemic corruption . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/christopherbooker/5301009/a-look-in-the-eus-unbalanced-books.html  in 1999 the entire european commission had resigned when , thanks not least to a commission whistleblower , paul van buitinen , every kind of fraud and corruption had come to light . 
  miss andreasen -- who was born to a danish father , lived in spain and had worked for various multi-national organisations -- began her new job as something of a `` european '' idealist , hoping she could help to put things right . 
   as soon as she arrived , she was invited to meet the court of auditors . 
  they welcomed her and expressed the hope that she could impose order on chaos , but warned that she would meet stiff opposition , not least from the powerful frenchman who for years had been in charge of the eu budget . 
  ( although her book changes officials ' names for legal reasons , he is identifiable without much difficulty as jean-paul mingassen . ), 
   as soon as miss andreasen began looking at the eu 's accounting system , she saw that it was a shambles . 
  between the 2000 and 2001 accounts , $ 200 million had gone missing without explanation . 
  she was told these were `` loans '' which had been \u00e2 written off ' . 
  senior officials were authorised to hand out huge sums without any proper records being kept . 
  accounts were kept on spreadsheets which could be accessed and changed without leaving any trace of who made the changes . 
   the system was open to fraud in every direction . 
  almost immediately , however , miss andreasen found herself being pressured to sign off the 2001 accounts which , as she said , would be a criminal offence , since this was the responsibility of her predecessor and she had been given none of the information needed to know whether or not they were correct . 
  the book is [ here ] ( http://archive.org/details/european_union_corrupted_power_system ) . 
  candela pe\u00f1a 's speech : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szmgeykrex8 i found an english translation [ here ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite3_1_22/02/2013_484272 ) . 
   pe\u00f1a thanked the academy for the award and went on to say that she had not expected to receive it . 
   `` i do n't know whether i should accept it in catalan , as a catalan actress , or whether i should just say , ` thank you very much , i am very happy , ''' pe\u00f1a said . 
   however , pushing formalities aside , the award-winning actress continued with a scathing criticism of austerity policies that came straight from the heart . 
  she recounted how before being cast for the lead role in cesc gay 's `` una pistola en cada mano '' ( a gun in each hand ) , she had been out of work for three years . 
   `` in those three years i watched my father die in a public hospital where there were no blankets to cover him with , no water for him to drink ; we had to bring it ourselves , '' said pe\u00f1a . 
   `` in those three years when i was out of work , i gave birth and i do not know what kind of public education my child has to look forward to . 
  in those three years without work i saw people die because they had no home , '' the actress told her audience . 
   `` this is why no one can sully the joy of this night for me . 
  standing here , i am asking for work . 
  i have a child to raise . 
  thank you , '' pe\u00f1a ended . 
   pe\u00f1a , a dramatic artist , described the dramatic turn of her own life and the dramatic reality being experienced by millions of people , like her , in the south of europe : successful people , people who were once at the top of their careers , who were at their creative peak and who have been cast to the margins of society by the economic crisis , who have been cut off from the present and who face a dark future . 
   in a mere 53 seconds , the accomplished actress summed up the plight of the people of spain , italy , portugal , greece , ireland , bulgaria , romania , estonia and all of crisis-hit europe . 
  maybe googling for more recent figures before submitting next time ? 
  that 's not a good way to present it though . 
  you get half of a monthly salary in easter , half in august , and 1 in christmas . 
  for 9 out of 12 months it 's what krattr wrote . 
  his $ 15 per day figure is spot on and includes those 2 `` extra '' installments . 
  also , the site is still wrong about those under 25 , their graphic says 23 + . 
   watch as greece votes for cyprus and vice versa this is expected , because the cypriots voting * are * greeks . 
  the northern part of the island is not represented , because only one state in the whole world recognizes it : turkey , the occupier . 
  a united europe is going to happen , one way or another , because everything else failed and led to tears . 
  also , the global competition is rising .
