  european countries must stand together , fragmentation is disasterous . 
  euro is the glue . 
  it wo n't fail , at least in the foreseeable future . 
  i do n't know what will happen in a few centuries . 
  it seems that we have an endless supply of idiots . 
  i 'm saving these stupid declarations for my archive . 
  euro has problems , solutions are not yet permanent , but some people do n't really understand what the euro is . 
   greece alone wants to enjoy the monopoly on the name `` macedonia '' you are mistaken . 
  let me try another approach . 
  a couple of decades ago , there were 2m greek macedonians living in macedonia , greece , and 1m yugoslav macedonians living in what was called [ vardard banovina ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vardar_banovina ) and then [ socialist republic of macedonia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialist_republic_of_macedonia ) , a federal unit within yugoslavia . 
  there was a clear distinction . 
  there was no real debate about their slavic heritage , their leaders did not bow before maps of `` united macedonia '' etc. 
  these things had been toned down significantly following the wars of the past . 
  now , there are 1.2 m people wishing to identify as macedonians and only as macedonians , in a country wishing to use the common name macedonia and only that . 
  however , this country occupies roughly a third of the area of macedonia , which is now a wider geographic region . 
  these people constitute one quarter of the people living in that region . 
  greek macedonians are the biggest group of this area ( half of its total population ) , and the greek region of macedonia occupies half of the region 's area . 
  the greek part of the region also includes the core territories of the ancient kingdom which gave the name to the wider region , and which is perceived as a [ hellenic ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hellenic ) kingdom by the vast majority of academics ( for a brief summary of the history of the region , supported by hundreds of distinguished specialists [ see here ] ( http://macedonia-evidence.org/obama-letter.html ) ) . 
  greece and many other countries support that these people and their country should identify as a part , and not as a whole . 
  they do have the right of self-identification , but their choice should reflect the realities of the region , and not lead to conflicts that might scale unexpectedly in the future . 
  simply put , they are not `` the '' macedonians , they are `` some '' macedonians '' . 
  there are greek macedonians , albanian macedonians , bulgarian macedonians , serbian macedonians , and others . 
   no one body has a monopoly on the name . 
  exactly . 
  this is the reason to accept the proposal i 've explained above . 
  `` part of '' macedonia and `` some macedonians '' . 
  let me offer an objective greek approach . 
  [ from the other thread  ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/188xw3/brussels_keeps_the_eu_door_open_for_skopje_but/c8crr58 )  [ austria fights about the name of a sausage . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17706290 ) i think it 's much more important to understand that [ 2,500,000 greeks identify themselves as macedonians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonians_ ( greeks \\ ) ) for many , many years now . 
  there 's a conflict of identities . 
  greece 's neighbours do n't seem to understand that [ macedonia is a wider geographic area ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonia_ ( region \\ ) ) and that they ca n't have a monopoly on the name . 
  greece asks them to accept that and identify accordingly . 
  it also asks them to stop using [ vergina sun ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vergina_sun ) , a registered greek state symbol . 
  greece and bulgaria also ask them to stop being ridiculous , claiming heritage from alexander the great and czar samuel . 
  how they manage to do something so outrageous is beyond my comprehension . 
  finally , their prime minister [ laying a wreath under a map of the so-called `` united macedonia '' ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-p-wp3q7jbr0/t-iseyvvzpi/aaaaaaaaefy/lrmuhmuwpdm/s1600/violation3.jpg ) is not going to do them any favours . 
  i wrote that ai relies on second-hand information . 
  this is 100 % true and has nothing to do with anyone 's intelligence . 
   so , whatever the government says the `` competent authority '' is on a subject we must just accept it ? 
  it 's not something `` the government says '' . 
  there are competent authorities to issue university degrees , competent authorities to deal with medical issues , and so on . 
  the [ office of internal affairs ] ( http://www.astynomia.gr/index.php?option=ozo_content&amp;perform=view&amp;id=49&amp; ) was established 14 years ago and is the competent authority for that matter , functioning under a specific legal framework . 
  governments and parties do n't matter . 
  it would be the same for any of them . 
  the exact same things are also true for other countries . 
   inappropriate it is for that `` authority '' to conduct the investigation attempts to discredit a competent authority as a whole because of some past failures seem like attempts to divert from the facts of this investigation , and have little to do with critical thinking . 
  you do n't know anything about the people involved in * this * investigation , yet you seem eager to discredit them . 
  what would you do given the spectacular failures of british police forces for 2012 alone , nuke * all * of them ? 
   if you bring data , it better be accurate . 
  they bring enough useful data to the table . 
  if anything , the data reinforce the argument that the police forces have nothing to hide * in this case * . 
  i wrote that even if they used only one camera and all timestamps ( create , write , modify ) were 100 % in agreement , you could still argue they had the ability to alter them . 
  that 's why you also rely on other evidence . 
  for example , critics said nothing about the amateur video and eyewitness reports , and they are awfully quiet about the perpetrators ' actions . 
  but we love you . 
  accession = good neighbourly relations = do not piss your neighbours off for the reasons i 've listed above, 
  i refuse to blame the germans this time !, 
  cultural heritage , island hopping , dramatic changes in scenery . 
  you can just use the search engine and find some pretty interesting photos . 
   the context implies that he is talking about the whole operation . 
  this is kozani `` s police director . 
  kozani is not in imathia . 
  geography , how does it work ? 
  ** did you watch the whole video ? 
  please , do n't just reproduce what people with limited language skills wrote . 
  i see several greek blogs `` reporting '' the same `` fact '' . 
  nonsense . 
  let me help you out . 
  there are three guys in this press conference . 
  http://i.imgur.com/ucrlhwf.jpg the guy in the centre is vaios chondros . 
  he is police chief for west macedonia and talks about the operation in general . 
  then he lets the other two guys talk about the part of the operation in their jurisdictions . 
  the second guy ( your guy ) is yorgos karaitsis . 
  he is kozani 's police director . 
  the robber arrested in kozani did not resist . 
  he says all went well , no harm done , that 's that . 
  the third guy is nikos batouvakis . 
  he is imathia 's police director . 
  he talks about the part of the operation that took place in veria . 
  `` dynamic intervention '' was his exact phrase . 
  this means `` we warned them , no response , we went all in '' . 
   i do n't see how the `` 4 arrested but only 3 tortured '' is an argument for anything . 
  no resistance = no harm done resistance = things will get ugly they had to arrest armed people holding a hostage . 
  those armed people resisted . 
  they had to force them to drop their guns and arrest them . 
  i 'm not sure what makes it * that * difficult to understand . 
  eyewitnesses saw everything . 
  policemen did not go there in order to invite them to a party . 
  they went there to take these guns : http://www.astynomia.gr/index.php?option=ozo_content&amp;lang='..'&amp;perform=view&amp;id=24664&amp;itemid=1058&amp;lang=  the case still makes sense . 
  the case makes sense when you apply some critical thinking on it . 
  on the other hand , conspiracy theories do not make sense . 
  actually , it was bulgaria this time . 
  [ austria fights about the name of a sausage .
