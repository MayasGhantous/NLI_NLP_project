   i found out about it and something [ else ] ( https://imgur.com/gallery/b4u2n ) a few days ago . 
  i posted it here , but it did n't get much attention ( or was removed by the mods/spam filter , because i did n't see it in / new ) . 
  mainly pasok , but nd and syriza too . 
  you 're absolutely right . 
  it 's sad that the parties that caused the problems that brought us to this point ( handing out jobs in the public sector to their voters , leeching on eu funds , establishing a clientelist state , encouraging tax evasion etc. ), 
  are still getting voted in . 
  otoh , the alternatives are n't much better . 
  well , that 's kinda irrelevant to the `` letting migrants freely enter the country '' accusation . 
  but even so : i actually live on one of those small islands ( lesbos ) that received thousands of refugees . 
  due to : 1 . the sheer number of refugees and 2 . the economic situation greece is facing , we ca n't process asylum requests for all those refugees . 
  i 'm not even sure that a refugee could request asylum !, 
  the best we could do was set up an identification center . 
  from what i gathered , migrants would go there and the refugees among them would be given permission to leave the island . 
  after most refugees left , it was shut down ( a shame , really ) . 
  now , it seems that the situation has worsened again . 
  well , all signs point to a coalition with syriza and some other parties . 
  i think that , thanks to syriza and the other parties ( pasok and potami , social democratic and center respectively ) , the refugee treatment will be much milder than what nd has planned . . nd will definitely not ** win ** , as in be able to form a government on their own / without syriza . 
  also , imho after a couple of hours `` negotiating '' , syriza and nd will happily form a coalition . 
  actually , the nd leader ( meimarakis ) has already said that they want to form a coalition with syriza . 
  about the two other parties , i 'm pretty sure they ( syriza and nd ) have already agreed with them . 
  fyi , most polls give both parties around 29-30 % , which is obviously not enough to form a government on their own ( even with the 50 seats bonus that the winner gets ) . 
  now , if nd formed a government on their own , i 'd be scared , because they are center right and nationalist too ( some members , at least ) . 
   both sides have agreed that the issue is the greek policy of letting migrants freely enter the country , who then continue their trip north . 
  ok guys , we 've solved it !, 
  the problem is ( yet again ) greece !, 
  migrants do n't enter our country through the land border . 
  we also share a huge sea border with turkey ( which is basically unpatrollable ) . 
  why ? 
  i find it really interesting . 
  the people that disagree with syriza 's current stance are probably voting for lae ( an anti-austerity , anti-eurozone party formed by 25 mps that broke off syriza after elections were announced ) or kke ( our communist party , anti-austerity , used to have an anti-eurozone and anti-eu stance but now nobody knows what they say ) . 
  the people that agree ( who pretty much did n't expect syriza to implement their campaign promises ) are probably staying with them or moving to other parties that have voted for the austerity offer too , like pasok ( social democratic ) , potami ( center ) or nd ( conservative ) . 
  remember not to vote in np ( non-participation ) threads , because that could get you banned from reddit . 
  26 points now . 
   i 'd say that hungarian gov and their police should be seen as a role models how to behave in crisis like this . 
  [ of course they should .

  hint : [ at least one person actually does ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ki6y3/pms_of_slovakia_ukraine_condemn_deal_to_expand_direct_pipeline_for_russian_gas_to_germany/cuxp695 ) . 
   - a left wing fascist regime . 
  damn , how can some people believe this ? 
  germany is ruled by a coalition of a center-right party ( cdu ) and a center-left party ( spd ) . 
  how can this even be a `` left-wing fascist regime '' ? 
  phew , threads like these are a much-needed break from immigration ones . 
  nice match today against slovenia , good luck !, 
  it 's not politico 's translators , it 's the eu parliament translators . 
  politico just embeds the official stream , found [ here ] ( http://www.soteu.eu ) . 
   edit : dammit juncker stop mixing english and french juncker confirmed for / u/dclauzel . 
   however , the eu sat down and negotiated . 
  no , the government went through with pretty much the same deal that was rejected in the referendum . 
  from the [ wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communism ) :  in political and social sciences , communism ( from latin communis , `` common , universal '' ) is a social , political , and economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of the communist society , which is a socioeconomic order structured upon the common ownership of the means of production and the ** absence of social classes , money , and the state ** . 
  ( emphasis mine ) but thanks , i 'll trust a kids ' encyclopedia . 
  also , i did n't start the conversation . 
  someone else did . 
  also , socialists advocate for the seizure of the means of production by the workers too . 
  i do n't know why you 'd think otherwise . 
  i conceded his point that the us did n't forcefully remove allende . 
  i did n't concede his point that socialist chile was a failed socialist state . 
  it implemented socialist policies successfully , it improved the workers ' quality of life etc. 
  see the links i linked above . 
  i consider that successful . 
  i also claimed that the us was working to undermine allende 's government and worked with pinochet 's junta afterwards . 
  again , i linked to sources . 
   i will rely on my sources that i used when i spent a month on this topic for my masters degree rather than your wiki link great job refuting my points there . 
  edit : if you have an issue with the wikipedia pages i linked , you can always raise it up on their respective talk pages . 
  wikipedia pages are almost always based on citations . 
  you could report parts of the pages for having no source or for being biased . 
  you could even edit the pages , adding new content and citing the sources you used for your masters degree . 
  but i guess you wo n't . 
   the us did n't forcefully remove allende , they acquiesced to an internal coup by the chilean military . 
  they did n't just acquiesce to a coup , [ they supported it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_intervention_in_chile#pinochet_regime ) . 
  they did n't cause it , i was wrong about that , but [ they sure facilitated it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_intervention_in_chile#allende_presidency ) . 
   the chilean economy was also in the shitter under allende , and he barely had the support of half his parliament . 
  you can hardly call that a `` successful socialist state '' a successful socialist state is one which implements socialist policies successfully . 
  [ allende did ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salvador_allende#presidency ) . 
  also , the parliament point is moot . 
  he was a democratically elected president . 
  you know , the ussr was n't communist . 
  the workers did n't have any real control in the ussr . 
  they may have had at the beginning , but they gradually lost it . 
  it became a dictatorship . 
  so were almost all other `` communist '' countries . 
  unfortunately , almost communist states seem to devolve into dictatorships . 
  which is why i 'm not a communist . 
  now , if you want to see a successful socialist state , see chile under allende , who was democratically elected and whom the us forcefully removed and put a neoliberal dictator , pinochet , in his place . 
  you seem to be confused about socialism , social democracy ( not socialist democracy ) and communism . 
  socialism \u2260 social democracy and socialism \u2260 communism . 
  scandinavian countries have welfare and some labor-friendly policies . 
  that 's all , that 's social democracy . 
  it 's still working within the confines of capitalism . 
  socialism is the control of the means of production by the workers . 
  it 's an ** economic model ** . 
  there 's democratic socialism , communism , anarchism etc. 
  ( i 'm a democratic socialist , myself ) communism is a ** political ideology ** . 
  it advocates for a revolution , followed by the dictatorship of the proletariat and by a stateless society . 
  usually , though , it stops at the dictatorship ( furthermore , it ceases to be for the proletariat ) . 
  thank you for your insightful analysis of socialism and socialist magazines . 
  i 'm sure that capitalism is much better , since almost everyone is well off . 
  it 's evident in europe and the us , who have low poverty rates and almost no economic inequality ... oh . 
  ps : / u/noh5phi7 is definitely not reading jacobin , just check his history .
