do you think that the world would be the same without these marches ? 
  i do n't think so , that 's why i believe the marches work . 
  and what ? 
  make them choose between extreme poverty and the risk of being killed or tortured ? 
  that 's absurd . 
  that 's unhuman . 
  screw them . 
  how dare to demand human rights in our luxury continent . 
  that 's disgusting / s, 
  i think we should sent you in africa and welcome at least one guy from africa in europe . 
  that will be much better :-), 
  so the difference between greece and the rest countries is that greece 's bonds reach maturation date and they are n't paid off . 
  it makes more sense now, 
  i know about my country :p then why they do n't pay them ? 
  if you are correct , why all countries have huge debts and they just get bigger and bigger ? 
  for example , usa has 17 trillion debt and no ones bats an eye and it does n't seem to become less any soon . 
   if you prove that greek is a dictaorship - post the links to it . 
  if not , admit to the fact that you elect your government !!!!!!!!!!, 
  why ca n't you admit to that ? 
  first of all , did i say that we do n't take responsibility for our mistakes in the past and present ? 
  no , i did n't . 
  it 's a fact . 
  i did n't say that we are in dictatorship but we have a model of democracy that is not working as ** it should be ** . 
  you probably say that we are on the right direction , i say that we are n't and we wo n't be * any soon * . 
  its a vicious circle . 
   what are you talking about ? 
  i was talking about debt/gdp ratio , and greece is by far the biggest . 
  no pne is talking about your numbers . 
  also , if you recall , the rules for joinoing the euro was 60 % debt/gdp ratio . 
  why are you talking about other numbers . 
  so , when you joined the euro , your debt was already higher and you lied about the numbers . 
  i saw this [ link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_external_debt ) about debr/gdp  what ? 
  i asked you to tell me why other people should pay for you . 
  that is not an answer . 
  and , poorer countries than greece , are paying for you . 
  estonia , african countries , asian countries . 
  who do you think the members of hte imf are ? 
  so , please answer the question , why should the rest of the world pay for you since you do not want to make cuts ` ? 
  do you believe that eu-world is paying us and does n't gain anything ? 
  i hope not . 
  nothing in world economies happens because of generosity . 
  so if , eu would n't gain anything they would let us default and let us alone . 
  if i remember correctly papandreou wanted to do a referendum if we wanted eu to help us by lending money . 
  but everyone tried to prevent it . 
  also , i do n't believe that europe did n't know how bad our economy truly was . 
  even , imf said that acted wrongly . 
  simply these mistakes costed some lives but they do n't worth to them . 
  as i said in the beginning , i do n't say that we were doing the right things all these years . 
  pretty much exactly the opposite . 
  but believing that only our mistakes are the ones to blame for the crisis is ** utterly ** wrong . 
  crises are bound to happen . 
  wherever you say greek people , just replace it with greek government . 
  in the last elections , the biggest party ( nd ) had ... 29,66 % of the votes or 79 members . 
  but the law says , the first party gets 50 members bonus so the 79 members becomes 129 ( !! ) . 
  the second biggest party couldnt get +50 memers even if it had more votes than nd just because it was a mix of small `` parties '' . 
  in the end , nd collaborated with 2 other smaller parties just to get more than 150 members in order to be majority ( the parliament has 300 members ) . 
  after some months the smallest party decided to leave and now there are just above 150 members . 
  and it was said , just because some members of gd got in prison , they could be 148 and still the government will be legal . 
  if they can bend the rules so easily , how can we make them leave ? 
   no other country is even near greece 's debt/gdp ratio of 170 % . 
  you are wrong . 
  luxembourg , ireland , uk , netherlands , belgium , monaco , switzerland , portugal , austria , sweden , france and denmark 's debt/gdp is bigger than greece 's 174 % . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_external_debt  please tell me that . 
  do n't forget that we are talking about humans live here . 
  you may seem to devaluate humans live so much . 
  i did n't say we should n't pay , but it should happen by a human standard . 
  at least , make sure that no people will die cause of the hunger and just take away some of our `` luxuries '' . 
  i know its extremely ignorant and childish to demand a gently capitalism but i refuse to let people die because of some money . 
  do you accept/want it ? 
   also , while i understand that things are horrendous , you are the minority view . 
  if the greek people had wanted things differently , why did the greek vote for the people you did ? 
  1 ) as i told you , the biggest party was only 30 % . 
  so you cant say , the majority . 
  2 ) in the past , nd and pasok ( the 2 biggest parties ) made many wrong choices just to please people and vote them . 
  people still remember that !, 
  ( mostly old people voted nd/pasok ) 3 ) one another reason is because others parties are not so trusted  if you want the changes you describe ( tax the rich for example ) it is perfectly legal to go through the parliament and get that legislation through . 
  since you do not i suppose the greek do not want it . 
  i didnt say that other parties are n't corrupted 2 . 
  many times , riches people threatened to leave the country if government decides to tax them more . 
  if i may , they got us from the balls . 
  that 's why i want a more direct-democracy . 
  i d prefer to have a direct-democracy and even fail from having a failed government which every year says , the year after we will leave recession . 
  with direct-democracy we can limit corruption , too . 
  i ll give you an example about the democracy now . 
  think how many people download illegal things and how much governments around the globe want to limit it . 
  its disproportionate . 
  ( its an example , let us do n't discuss about piracy ) . 
  the same applies about the taxes of the riches/corporations and low-income people . 
  as you said , there is not time to riot every week about every wrong decision . 
  i agree with you , about the wrong choices all these years . 
  you ca n't imagine how wrong is our attitude . 
  but all these things happened by our parents and the next generation is just in the eye of tornado . 
  i do n't say we should be spared but at least any action taken in order to fix economy should be well thought . 
  since 2009 , the riches became even more richer and the poor people , poorer . 
  that is not good at all . 
  this is a sign that nothing achieved . 
  and believe me , everything falls apart . 
  also , if i can recall correctly , there countries that have bigger debt than us and yet we have the most brutal crisis . 
  of course , i cant prove that more than 50 % percent of population protested and no one cant . 
  but if i was in government 's shoes , after all these scandals ( just yesterday broke a huge scandal ) and all these riots with ridiculous worthless violence i would let people to vote again .
