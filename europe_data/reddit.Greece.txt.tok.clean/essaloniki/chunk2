  its decent but all these elected people just want to have power . 
  as for the euro , pretty much the biggest parties want it . 
  as far as i know , syriza , the 2nd biggest party , plans to negotiate the debt by saying : `` we know that the debt is huge.with these actions , we will never be able to pay it . 
  help us by loosening the actions and we will pay . '', 
  personally , it looks more feasible than what the government says . 
  austerity and austerity . 
  strangely how many countries in europe do n't want austerity but we are `` lucky '' to have austerity !, 
  not to forget , almost every day there is a gathering about some wrong government 's choice . 
  also , after the surplus achieved only the police got a 500 euro ( !! ), 
  raise and some homeless people got some money . 
  if i start bashing the current government it wont end :p, 
   where only a few percent of the population were actually allowed to vote . 
  yes , you are right . 
  i dont want only few percent of the population to vote , but the whole population . 
  ( 18 + years old )  yes , so why did you vote for them then ? 
  personally , i did n't vote them . 
  i suppose people voted because they thought , were the least worse than others . 
  also , do n't forget that nd is one of the two parties that brung us in this situation . 
   that is impossible , for several reasons . 
  say that you want higher pensions , lower taxes and retire early . 
  and then you vote no to no more loans ? 
  and , democracy does n't mean that every single thing should be voted on . 
  then people would have to vote every day , not have time to work etc. 
  that is why we have parliaments , so they can vote every day for us . 
  it is completely unrealistic to sat that the public should vote on every single issue . 
  we could just decide the major issues , like this multi-law `` packet '' we have the means to achieve a more direct democracy and avoid corruption . 
  you say that , by revolution the minority will decide of majority . 
  i say , that this is happening today not only in greece but everywhere in the world . 
  the elite decides , the ones that have capital and its absurd to believe the opposite . 
   if you do n't like the system you have why have you created it , kept it , voted for it , and why ca n't you change it democratically ? 
  the same answer as in the question `` why people accept poverty '' . 
  because they are apolitical and they are a huge propaganda against the ones that try to change the way the system is . 
  i can not believe people in 2014 , still accept the fact that there are people who die in hunger while in the 1st world throw food away . 
  also , i can not believe people accept that fact that they are poor and do n't know whom to blame or do n't even react . 
  in addition , in every riot , the police is there and use violence even when there is absolutely no need . 
  ( against disabled people , old people , etc ) even if somehow i could gather millions of people who want to overthrow government , government will try to break this gathering . 
  for example in june or july 2011 , they wanted to sign a similar to this recent multi-law `` packet '' . 
  they gathered people with masks and sticks to provoke police and break the gathering . 
  with this , even if people wanted democratically and peaceful want to overthrow the current government is pretty difficult . 
  on many of these events i mentioned , there photos/videos . 
  ukraine revolted some months ago against its democratically elected president . 
  by voting someone and have them elected for the next 4 years doesnt mean that you will agree with anything he said before the elections . 
  also , there is a high possibility he was lying just to get elected . 
  in my country , both of them happened . 
  also , democracy isnt working as it supposed to work , nowadays . 
  it should be done just like in ancient athens . 
  people should be asked all the time if they accept with each decision . 
  just 3 days ago , our government passed a multi-law `` packet '' with more than 300 pages . 
  people didnt even were asked . 
  today there was a new scandal . 
  corruption everywhere . 
  in my country , at least , young people are usually more the old ones when there is a riot and always there is at least one student 's bloc . 
  also , the more powerful riot the more younger people are .

  as if only youtube can stream audio leaks ... 
  from what i saw , a change in dns server is enough to bypass twitter 's block . 
  they can just use google 's or better , freedns 's dns ( 208.67.222.222 ) and access twitter . 
  but generally , a vpn is a hell of lot better, 
   when i went to college ( between 2005-2009 ) dorms were around $ 2000/semester . 
  the same applies for the massive fees-loans . 
   i had a 2 bedroom , 2 bathroom apartment with a kitchen and living room and it was still considered a dorm . 
  here , one friend of mine , live in one room with another random same-age person , some furniture and 2 seperate beds + bathroom . 
  of course , hotel doesnt let them any guests , not even his parents . 
  also , all these parties from movies in houses , i heard they are real . 
  are they ? 
  i dont know about the dorms in us but here , in order to be accepted in dorm your family must have very low income . 
  if you are accepted , then yes , its free . 
  in ** some cases ** , universities and dorms offer ( free ) food . 
  so if you are in a dorm , you can either eat in uni or in dorm . 
  bonus1 : until , now everyone could eat in the university i was taking about , even if you werent studying in this university . 
  now they are trying to forbid it . 
  bonus2 : some universities , own hotels and they offer some of the rooms to students . 
  edit : how much is the rent for dorm per month ? 
  in greece , the dorms are better . 
  not the slightest like norway 's prison but not like these dorms . 
  my gf lives in a dorm , in one of the biggest universities in greece ( auth ) and i can confirm that : * dorm provides food every morning , lunch , afternoon . 
  * there is proper heating . 
  this year around 7 days there were not heating * free electricity , water and wifi ( ~ around 30 mbps download/upload ) * no moisture * there are electricians , etc for any damages there used to be much better but it keeps getting worse since crisis.before or after last summer , it was said that there wont be any free food and some time the residents must pay rent . 
  until now , it didnt happen . 
  lol . 
  no , you are cultarely related to ancient macedonia as i to planet mars . 
  that about 30 years of bad government is true . 
  but honestly after so many countries hit by crisis , i started to believe that it was inevitable . 
  piigs ( or at least greece ) were just the ones , with worse government ( at least ) than the others . 
  why not freer from all ? 
   so why should they employ workers they do n't really need ? , are they supposed to be some sort of charitable institution that just gives away money to people ? 
  this must be changed sooner or later . 
  just because they are losing money , does n't mean that these `` useless '' people must be fired and starve . 
  food for thought : in 2030 , 2 billions work will be lost due to automation and robots . 
  of course , big companies are n't charitable institutions to pay the people who demand money and some rights when they can use robots to work 24/7 . 
  my country has never embraced communism , the corruption is too high and anything public never is being done right . 
  i do n't say that communism was different from what you say , but if we have to blame one economic system , it would n't be communism . 
  still , you are wrong . 
  how nobody is responsible for what is being done in sochi ?

  police from the beginning were protecting the rich people and always were against marches and leftists . 
  for example , if you do n't know , fascists this september killed pavlos fisas , because he was antifa . 
  today , it got known that , the police center , after the killing took place , said the policemen not to catch the killers and to stay away instead of catching them .
