  ( there are countless evidents on how much the police is corrupted ) unfortunately , events like these even on our country are n't reported . 
  of course , we , people were angry about this and there we re countless marches . 
  every time , our government decides its good to sign another deal and decrease our minimum wage and many others , there are marches . 
  one example amongs many is this ( june 2011 ) [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r86gie1c-jg ) where there were many people and as usual our police tried to ruin it . 
  [ here the cops are helping people with mask ] ( http://sofistis.wordpress.com/2011/06/30/30-06-11/ ) if you want a bettery view , view the suggested videos on the right side . 
  ( they are videos from our opposition ), 
  one example for the 1st is skouries in chalkidiki . 
  a huge portion of people are against gold mining cause of the enviromental disaster . 
  also , about the 2nd one . 
  i believe labour costs arent so high . 
  our minimum wage is very low from what it was used to be , and we lost many working rights . 
  so i think it is all the rest . 
  * here we have newspapers with frontpage the picture of pavlos fyssas which was just killed . 
  * here we have newspapers that names who is the guilty of the killings in marfin ( may 2010 ) which the trial hasnt completed , yet . 
  the funny is that evidence are silly and they got the wrong person . 
  * here we have newspapers that legalize golden dawn . 
  * here , our channels try to manipulate public 's opinion by adding sounds effects . 
  ( case of grigoropoulos in 2008 ), 
  in greek , too . 
  we put - \u03b1\u03ba\u03b9 ( aki ) in the end of every word , when we want to say it 's small . 
  also , greece never violates human rights ... 
   police telling them they would n't be allowed to protest police said that both of them are allowed to gather but not to protest-march to the streets . 
  as i know , golden dawn didnt marched-protested , but antifa did . 
   the threat of murder from left wing extremists it 's a pretty large turnout . 
  i hope you dont refer to the 2 killings of golden down supporters near their offices , a month ago , because its a lie ( i can explain it if you want ) . 
  until now , there are no deaths of any supporter of golden dawn from a far-left extremist . 
  also , the reason being so few people at this gathering , is not because they are afraid . 
  dont forget police ** always ** cover their backs . 
  ( 1 in 2 policemen vote gd ) . 
  police never let any protest to get nearby gd offices . 
  on the 3rd pic , it says that this is the moment when they fired their lighter and if we consider that in one m ^ 2 fits 4 people , on this road fit maximum 2500 people . 
  taking consideration the second picture and the ps1 , i dont believe there are more than 1200 people . 
  for a national invitation there are veryyyy few people . 
  on the other side , antifa protest : [ image1 ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bavhwboccaa1yei.jpg:large ) [ image2 ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bavfaneceaazy-o.jpg:large ), 
  what about a truecrypt file container inside a truecrypt file container and so on ? 
  the good thing is there is no limits about security and how many encryptions are you using , except the time and the effort the other needs to decrypt them , and in this case , i wouldnt my gf send me her pics and need 5 minutes to see them :p, 
  yes , i am angry with everyone who contributed on this situation . 
  we were doing so many things wrong but everytime i think of it , i wonder , `` ok in my country we were so wrong , what about the rest of europe?were they wrong , too ? '', 
  you europeans were constantly accused us being lazy and all of sudden italy , spain and portugal is in recession , too ) and i realize that it was bound to happen even we were less corrupted . 
  as for the solution , even though i am not economic manager or anything like that , i believe that we must cut down bureaucracy and reform the public sector from the beginning ( hey , we have one of the lowest incomes and companies still dont invest on us ) . this doesnt mean , fire the 50 % lowest salaries public servants , but change the way its organized and the way it works.now , public sector is amazingly slow and non-effective . 
  firstly we are angry with our government and then we the rest of the eu . 
  as for the second question , many times people went on strike , on the roads but thanks to police nothing happened . 
  ( once , there were 1 million people but still , our parliament , didnt think of that , and voted what we didnt want ) but the people , who is becoming more and more poorer and angrier , only needs a cause . 
  because our government is doing it with the wrong way . 
  for example : couple of weeks ago , they shut down our national channel - ert . 
  it is a public secret that , in ert were working many people , who had connections with politicians and they were getting huge incomes for doing something they werent worth it . 
  also , ert many times showed government 's propaganda . 
  and they shut down , with 3 signatures , not because of the majority in parliament . 
  i find it an irony , that the ones ( politicians ) were the one who hire their people and now , all of sudden , they try to fix it ? 
  propably , the new ert , will still have the some people with huge incomes and the ones with 990euro salaries who were worth them , will be unemployed . 
  unfortunately , in public sector , the ones who were getting huge income , will continue to do so and the lowest ones , will be propably unemployed . 
  and we will continue live our daily routine , struggling to pay our taxes as this article never written . . 
  in comparison with us ( greece ) , you have so many aspects of physics in one exam . 
  you study kinetic , thermodynamic , waves , electric energy , particles , in one year.we study these in 2 years , in 17 and 18 years old . 
  ( 11 and 12th grade ) . 
  also , i notice , that there is great scalability of the questions . 
  you answer almost ~ 100 question whereas we answer ~ 20 questions . 
  this is our physics , in our nation wide final exams [ link ] ( http://www.minedu.gov.gr/publications/docs2013/them_fis_kat_c_hmer_no_1305.pdf ), 
  i am suprised , the last one is considered math course.it is the same as with our 12 grade , physics , exactly before get into universities . 
  chemistry comes from ancient greek word , too !, 
  31 c at 1 pm and 23.7 c at midnight , half an hour ago !, 
  and its pretty normal !, 
  please do, 
  correct me if you will , 
  you have right.english is not my first language . 
  the fact that he tried to punch/kill/frighten the mayor which he elected democratically and he punched a 12 years old , yes , i want to believe that some of gd voters have changed their minds . 
  on the other hand , some people believe , why should we stop someone who delivers free food to some people only-greeks ? 
  let us hope his asylum and not only his , will be lifted of . 
  that was kasidiaris, 
  it makes me extremely sad , that bbc ignored the fact that one member of golden dawn , was so mad because of this , that he tried to shoot the mayor of athens !, 
  [ video1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=dazbbv4b3bs ) [ video2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=-rw8o-5ej5e# ! ), 
  ( also , the same person , punched a 12 yo girl today ) . 
  extremely sad news , too . 
  either way , they are not in our pockets :p, 
  question everything . 
  if we were to believe every article that pops up then : * we have money ( thats what papandreou , our ex-prime minister said back in 2009 ) * we should have gone out of repression around 2-3 times by now . 
  * many articles said we , the greeks , are lazy people and thats the reason of repression , but the same happened in other countries , too ( pigs ) ps.please before accuse anyone , search if for yourself ps2.there are many children that faints in school , because of the hunger ps3.i oppose to those who attacks and insults germans and merkel , too . 
  the first ones to blame , are our politicians and our way of thinking . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/chancellor-merkel-rejects-findings-of-ecb-wealth-report-a-895365.html ) if we are richer than german and the rest of countries , even after all these countless vast taxes , then all the north countries must have been in poverty , all these years . 
  and the same day , a german magazine says quite almost the opposite [ link ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/poor-germany-it-is-time-for-a-debate-on-euro-crisis-burden-sharing-a-894398.html ) as a greek , i can say that only a part of the spiegel 's article is true . 
  unfortunately , our public servants , used to have a huge income with a lot bonuses and many of them , used to not going to work , even though they were paid ( ! ), 
  aka oathbreakers . 
  the public servants were/are a vast number and politicians , in order to become elected once a again , they used to do them favors . 
  now , with crisis , their income lowered and their bonuses vanished as well.these fired people , most of them , were the lowest in public sector however there are still some people , that take huge income and do nothing . 
  these are the people that the article talks about , and i think we all agree , these people must have their income slashed . 
  another thing , i d like to add is that the crisis made the poors poorer and the riches , richer . 
  there are many people that are literally starving whilst there are still people that are going to bouzoukia with their mercs and spent 90euro a night . 
  also , from my point of view , soon things will start getting better . 
  many people have started to realise , that we can not ask bigger salaries than europe or even the same , as we mistakenly did , if we dont have better products , etc. 
  i have heard , some oga subventions are started to be given , like the 90s . 
  they give subventions to those who plant tabac , in agrinio . 
  i truly wish , more and more subventions to be given , in order we start finally living our own without imports and even start exports like 90s . 
  also , after the last months , we see that eurozone is not gon na be split . 
  germany invited us in ~ 2000 , so as to , have a strong currency and can fight $ and yen and what we see today is a over-inflated dollar and yen while euro is still the same.back in 2000 , only 1 country theoritically could be in eurozone , and deliberately they let so many countries join eurozone for this reason . 
  i hope the repression go away soon in all of us . 
  this is my homble opinion , if believes i am wrong , i d really like to correct me . 
  as of today , for greece : 1 . goverment shut down indymedia athens ( an anarchist site ) , which is hosted in greek national university , in athens.they justified it by saying `` it was illegally hosted in national 's university '' . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.enetenglish.gr/?i=news.en.society&amp;id=628 ) 2.150.000 public servants are going to be fired by 2015 . some of them , are oath-breakers . 
  ( even though they are paid , they dont go to work ) [ link ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_20/02/2013_483890 ) 3 . chalkidiki is in sos.the half of the citizens , are against the gold mining skouries . 
  this week police arrested people , who are against the gold mining in the middle of the night .
