it seems this time it 's the other way around and the color took its name after the fruit . 
  that 's remarkable in and by itself . 
  kudos to you sir/lady !, 
  on my part it took me 6 years of elementary school , 3 years of middle school and another 3 years in high school and still manage to make spelling errors that make me blush . 
  wait !, 
  are you saying that you learned greek in * one * year ? 
  it literally means that . 
  untouchable . 
  the greek page in wikipedia [ \u03a1\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac ] ( http://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/%ce%a1%ce%bf%ce%bc%ce%ac ) provides more information so i am quoting the corresponding section ( \u039f\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 - naming ) :  roma are in most countries known with words related to `` gypsy '' or `` giouftos . '', 
  these words come from the word `` egyptian '' and their use is due to the belief of earlier times that the roma originated in egypt . 
  the word `` roma '' is used in many parts by them and in their language means `` man '' or `` husband . '', 
  among them they more often use the words `` melele '' ( black people ) , `` manous '' ( man ) and `` sinte '' . 
  also , the word '' \u03b1\u03b8\u03af\u03b3\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 '' or '' \u03b1\u03c4\u03c3\u03af\u03b3\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 '' means the `` untouched '' ( from the name of the lowest hindu caste , from which it is speculated that they originated ) and derives from the privative alpha and the verb \u03b8\u03b9\u03b3\u03b3\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9 ie `` touch '' ( modern greek is '' \u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03af\u03b6\u03c9 '' ) . 
  not to be confused with the religious group \u0391\u03b8\u03af\u03b3\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 who acted in the 8th century in the byzantine empire and had great influence . 
   regarding the european area the french word gitan and spanish gitano originate from the same etymology as the word gypsy . 
  the german word zigeuner and slavic tsigan or cigan seem to have a different source , and are related to the greek word \u03b1\u03b8\u03af\u03b3\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 , used both to describe the above religious group , but also the `` pagans '' roma when they first appeared in the territories of the byzantine empire . 
  thus the term predates their appearance . 
  they call themselves rom with the plural roma in most dialects . 
  the word rom is synonymous to dom , the word used by the indians for the word `` human . '', 
  even groups such as sinti who do not call themselves rom keep the word with the meaning of `` spouse '' . 
  \u03a4he translation was done with google translate and some minor corrections here and there . 
  hopefully i did n't botch it up and it 's not totally incomprehensible . 
  actually in greece we have \u03b3\u03cd\u03c6\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 ( giftos as in gypsie ) , \u03a1\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1 ( read it as roma ) and \u03c4\u03c3\u03b9\u03b3\u03b3\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ( tsigano\u03c2 , which resembles cig\u00e1n from your country ) . 
  a few other as well but those are the most commonly used . 
  the word tsiganos is considered a pc term , which by investigating the roots of the word is rather peculiar . 
  tsiganos originates from \u03b1\u03b8\u03af\u03b3\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 which literary means `` the one you do n't touch '' and is related to the untouchable caste in india from which it is alleged they originate . 
  and yet the term gypsie which originates from egyptian ( another misconception that places their origin in egypt ) is considered insulting . 
  the more you know i guess . 
  i have heard money being called \u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9 ( read : caseri ) which is a kind of cheese but it derives from `` cash '' . 
  i have also used \u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9 ( read : maruli ) which is lettuce . 
  | they got so much negative publicity , which was often just slander , but it seems they made it . 
  this economic crisis is most certainly a very dark moment for modern greece . 
  and i am of the opinion that quite a large part of the blame rests on our shoulders.as such , negative publicity , to a certain extend , is not only justified but actually necessary . 
  yet this four-year-long non-stop avalance of character assassination of the greek people has demoralized me more than anything . 
  and it has done so to most people i am familiar with . 
  overall the damage done is deep and will have consequences in the far future and our cultural identity . 
  70 % percent approval rate . 
  a tough stance against greece - and i 'm not judging here whether it 's right or wrong - is very popular these days . 
  i am not even sure that is the correct number . 
  i would never think that the skaramangas shipyards employed so many people . 
  in fact given their current state i * highly * doubt it . 
  for even more fun keep in mind that they ( ship owners ) have been outsourcing to chinese shipyards way before the crisis . 
  i know that because a friend of mine is a naval engineer and he used to travel to china a lot for oversight of reparation works . 
  the reason to do so is of course that the price per kilo ( repairs are mostly billed by the kg ) is about one third compared to the one found in greece . 
  but so is the craftsmanship . 
  so when a relatively new ship is in need of repairs , greek shipyards are preferred . 
  on older ships china is the choice . 
  it 's worth taking a note that greek shipyard laborers ( mostly metal workers ) are considered world class . 
  their wages are also reflecting that but within the confines of greece ( eg they would not be considered highly paid in a more prosperous country ) . 
  all in all for the ship owners the bottom price is that counts . 
  and that was before 2008 . 
  his point is moot . 
  they have been outsourcing those jobs for years now . 
  i do not blame them of course for doing so . 
  i mean , i do not feel too good about it ( or at all ) , but they are running a bushiness after all . 
  then again i do not considered them as greek citizens either . 
  they happen to be born greeks , some of the live here , some have their headquarters here and a big percentage of their employees are greeks . 
  but given their participation in greece 's woes and the reparations of them i view them as detached moguls . 
  international people . 
  that 's what they are . 
  i have been a lot of times in serbia and i experienced it just as you say . 
  and i am trying hard here to be objective because i fell quite in love with your country and its people . 
  cheesy as it sounds , yet some of my best memories are from there . 
  thank you for that one . 
  every time i see those imbeciles from golden dawn make the frontpage here and in / r/worldnews my stomach clenches a little . 
  i long for the days were they had a nice and healthy 0,3 % and were regarded as the scum that they are . 
  it has already lost it to a certain degree but still it 's different enough . 
  in any case , while the coastline might get more commercialized the center of the island will remain just the way you remember it . 
  thus your escape plan holds intact !, 
  which by the way is the same escape plan several expats are applying . 
  ikaria had massive immigration to europe and the us in the 60s i think ( not sure about dates ) . 
  but i would not worry too much about the tourism industry because of the way the island is `` marketed '' by the exact same people : as a serene and peaceful place away from the high-speed lifestyle . 
  and as such it will always attract people of that mindset . 
  the moment it gets too crowded is the moment it looses its appeal . 
  it 's nice to see about my father 's birthplace in / r/europe . 
  it is indeed a rather ... relaxed place . 
  and the old timers there are famously non-punctual . 
  imagine the archetypal british person . 
  one that is on time every time . 
  now think of his/hers polar opposite , we will call him/her person a. i have it on good authority that two decades ago person a would be considered too punctual for ikaria . 
  ok this is a hyperbole yet you understand the picture . 
  yes . 
  peiraias and south in general . 
  i mean greeks in greece . 
  the sentiment i perceive from the diaspora it 's quite different . 
  also please note that i do not question your honesty when you are relaying your experience . 
  i just find it so polar to mine . 
  please do n't misunderstand me . 
  when i say self-loathing i mean that they are not happy to be greeks . 
  a deep-sited belief of inferiority . 
  and a type of '' \u03bc\u03bf\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 '' ( literal translation of this means would be `` mourning for your fate '' but it misses some subtle points . ), 
  if anything the greeks i meet tend to feel dwarfed by their past and the resulting culture without achievements of their own to match up . 
  and that kind of sentiment is damaging to the individual and it often morphs to a false pride which is nothing more than a facade for one 's , perceived or real , inefficiencies . 
  as a side-note , i do not preach under any circumstances that one should take _ pride _ in his/hers nationality . 
  after all what has one done to gain it ? 
  be born in it ? 
  by the same measure should tall people feel proud to be tall ? 
  of course one can feel _ happy _ about the circumstances he/she was born in , but pride implies an accomplishment and none has actually taken place . 
  but you talk of other contemporary behaviors that i * do * know . 
  and i have come across the '' \u03bc\u03ac\u03b3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2 '' and the '' \u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 '' ( street smart and comfortably settled , respectively ) .
