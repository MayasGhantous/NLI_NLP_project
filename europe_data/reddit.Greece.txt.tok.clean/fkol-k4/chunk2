  yes , while the banks are empty and none can get paid . 
  that . 
  where does that come from ? 
  greece is of no use to russia unless it is an ez member . 
  greece ca n't leave the eurozone even if it defaults , there is no mechanism for that . 
  it will just be a country that has euro in theory , but it 's people wo n't actually have any money . 
  unless you mean `` if greece leaves the european union '' . 
  in that case , it 's very difficult to predict what will happen to the rest of europe . 
  it might be ok overall , or maybe hell will break loose ... 
  it depends on how much greece will be fucked ... 
   greek parliamentary audit committee this is not accurate . 
  this is not an official parliamentary committee , it is not formed by the parliament parties . 
  this is a commitee formed by ( and for ) the parliament 's president zoe konstantopoulou and it acts as a consultant for her . 
  migrate . 
   if it has to choose between the two however it has been quite clear it will choose the first and the greek people ( wisely or unwisely ) will agree :  ...  the greek public will rally around syriza and blame the creditors . 
  yeah , do n't bet on that ... 
  if you thought bailout program austerity was bad , wait till you see the new ` no-bailout program ' austerity . 
  yes , i did watch the video and ** everything in it is bullshit ** . 
  it 's the same bullshit that brought corale ( coalition of radical left ) in power so that they could destroy whatever was left in the country . 
  what a bunch of bullshit . 
  greece 's problem was never the euro by itself . 
  it was ( and still is ) the extensive corruption on its huge public sector . 
  i was expecting a bigger gap from the third place actually . 
  pasta is extremely popular in greece . 
  they decide for way more than they get credit for ... 
  with the exception of the church ( * and that 's where kammenos comes in helped by the vast numbers of voters that do n't want to oppose the church * ) , all the rest is exactly what every other pure left government in the world has done too . 
  the problem is n't what syriza does , the problem is that as a society we had idealized one word ( `` left '' ) and now that we see it for what it really was we do n't like it . 
  so , instead of accepting that we were wrong , we are in denial and try to find another `` left '' that will do something else . 
  yes , he is . 
  but what does that mean ? 
  you take left and right and they average centre ? 
  that 's not how it works . 
  besides , far left and far right are much closer than most believe ... 
  greece 's governments is not centre-left . 
  it is pure left . 
  a lot of scientists does not equate to ` smart country ' . 
  well , that had 2500 years to sink in ... 
  yeah , we all know the truth , we just ca n't afford to accept it . 
  yet ... 
   how much of what he says is true ? 
  every single word . 
   how much of it is `` publicity '' to gain support saying these things in greece is not a way to gain any kind of support . 
  in fact , it is an extremely fast way to commit political suicide . 
  these are extremely unpopular views in greece . 
  i do n't think that it 's a ` native speaking vs 2nd language speaking ' issue . 
  it 's more an orthophony thing and it applies to every language . 
  for example , why is it that most non-native english speakers perfectly understand english in films , tv-series , scholars and politicians from all native english speaking countries ? 
  simply because in these cases orthophony matters and people just take very good care on how they 're speaking . 
  in every language there are people that just do n't care about it . 
  it 's just that native speakers can get around it easily and do n't make it a subject . 
   your argument was that dubs lose tone , accent , and other intonations that the original films have -- which is simply false it 's not false , you 're just selecting to ignore its concequenses . 
  foreign accents can not be translated , they can only be matched with a domestic accent that `` comes close to context '' . 
  it might be a good effort , but it 's still not the same thing . 
  and you ca n't dub morgan freeman 's voice . 
  you just ca n't ...  dubs are hard to put together , and require a lot less effort than the hard but relativly easier task of subbing . 
  i think you mean `` a lot more effort '' . 
  yes , you 're right . 
  i 've subbed , but i ca n't dub . 
  but this is irrelevant . 
  it is both easier and better unless you 're too young to read ... 
   i 'm also not suggesting we get rid of the normal versions or subtitled versions either no one is , we 're just expressing our opinions about what we consider better and why ...  you 're also making a case against deaf-subtitled usage i 'm doing what ??? 
  how is my `` subtitles are better '' opinion a case against subtitles ? 
  because a deaf person is missing out on the original voice ? 
  well , hello , a deaf person is missing out on the dubbed voice as well , how is that relevant ? 
   if you want to watch a non-dubbed film , go do it , by all means . 
  no one is stopping you . 
  you 're being passive-agressive . 
  no one is stopping you from watching dubbed films as well . 
  do not personalise the argument . 
   having such a large dubbing sector gives voice actors who might not be employed without it , a job . 
  another solution would be that the domestic industry should do better productions , make the country 's films popular abroad , have more jobs in the sector . 
  the turkish do it with their tv-series . 
  but besides that , actors having a job has nothing to do with what we 're talking about ... 
  it 's not about english dominating the market . 
  after all , english is not the only foreign language in a film . 
  listening to the original dialogs adds to the experience . 
  a big part of an actor 's great performance are the language manneurisms , the tone of the voice , some times the accent . 
  all those things shape the overall character in a film . 
  for an example , imagine a louis de fun\u00e8s film ( he practically raised my generation in greece ) . 
  then , take his voice out . 
  it just wo n't be the same film anymore . 
  good brand name ... 
   it 's not like it 's a way to measure distance by cigarettes smoked or something , obviously . 
  actually , it is exactly that . 
  one cigarette is five to ten minutes ( let 's say 7,5 avg ) , so `` two cigarettes down this street '' means `` walk this way for about 15 minutes and you 'll be there '' . 
  granted , the expression originates from a time when most greeks did n't wear watches but all of them were smoking , so that was actually a convenient way . 
  my guess would be some where in the early 20th century . 
  a quick summary is in the frontpage , as titles . 
  you can see the more detailed pdf by clicking the '' ** quarterly national accounts ( flash estimates ) , 2nd quarter 2016 ** '' title , under '' ** press releases ** '' . 
  quick sum is , we have -0.7 % growth if we measure the gdp diff from last year 's 2nd qrt , but we have 0.3 % growth if we measure from this year 's 1st qrt . 
  which it does n't make sense really , because 2nd qrt is tourist period and annual tax bills , so of course gdp is going to be higher than 1st qrt . 
  just helping ... 
  the article above in english , [ via google translate ] ( https://translate.google.gr/translate?sl=el&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=el&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.efsyn.gr%2farthro%2fufesi-kai-v-trimino-toy-2016&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ), 
  really ? 
  because in [ elstat homepage ] ( http://www.statistics.gr/en/home/ ) ( data just published ) , there does n't seem to be any growth . 
  unless ft means that `` greece is doing 0.3 % less shitty this year compared to 2015 '' , where in that case yeah , we 're kicking ass ... 
   hard to choose which one is worse greece or turkey ? 
  depends . 
  we are worse in football , they are worse in basketball . 
  then again we make great souvlaki , they make great kebab .
