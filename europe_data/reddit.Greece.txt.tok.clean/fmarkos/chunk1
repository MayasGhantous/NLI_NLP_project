  unfortunately corruption is still prevalent . 
  some fringe media point it out , but police and justice are doing nothing about it . 
  turkish military planes invade greek airspace in an effort to establish their rule over the aegean . 
  our planes have to intercept them , so we waste money on fuel . 
  there is a threat of [ casus belli ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aegean_dispute ) they are also trying to cause trouble wherever there are muslims in greece like komotini . 
  one of their ex prime ministers even admitted that their secret service caused major forest fires in greece . 
  there is [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sledgehammer_%28coup_plan%29 ) and more , but i hope i satisfied your curiosity . 
  you mean this : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_security_and_defence_policy ? 
  i feel it is not well defined . 
  in greece we are constantly under threat from turkey . 
  regarding our exclusive economic zone ( eez ) immigration and other matters . 
  what would europe do if we were attacked , like the last time with the [ imia crisis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imia/kardak ), 
  common defense , like a mini nato . 
  judging an entire group by the actions of a few bad apples sounds like racism . 
  80 % of the things he said about greece i have heard from other respectable sources . 
  i can not verify them as i was n't there . 
  20 % was new to me . 
  ** some ** police are pieces of shit . 
  blame an entire police force for a bunch of hooligans ? 
  so far , biased against republicans and soft on stalin and the soviet union . 
  the tone of voice when speaking about stalin was kinder gentler than when talking about some republican . 
  mentions stalin 's atrocities in passing with a few words but expands on the flaws of the right . 
  other than that , very informative . 
  i enjoyed it and learned some things . 
  focuses on the bad things the u.s. has done in their history but omits the good things . 
  i can excuse that because it is after all the `` untold history '', 
  largest ? 
  scandal is the corruption that becomes public knowledge . 
  imagine the size and number of corrupt deals that we never learn . 
  pharmaceuticals , weapons , energy . 
  those came at about 1300ad . 
  they are assimilated in the greek nation perfectly . 
  if you go that far back you can also go to 2000-3000 years ago where no albanian idea existed at all . 
  you did n't name one . 
  btw speaking albanian does n't make one an albanian . 
  a lot of greeks that live in albania are offended if you call them albanian . 
  lots of fun stories with that . 
  lies !, 
  name three . 
  not that sad or crazy !, 
  at least not yet . 
  southern part of albania has a strong greek population . 
  so i guess if there is going to be a change of borders this might be included . 
  in athens there are many places where we ca n't breath outside from the heavy use of fireplaces . 
  burned wood particles are visible in the air . 
  it is sad . 
   so ethnic germans who lived in modern day poland , who may have lived there for hundreds of years , should be punished for a war started by their ethnic german cousines in germany ? 
  yes . 
  because they were used as an excuse for germany to invade ( afaik ) . 
  this way , next time there will be no excuse . 
  i know it is harsh , i do n't like people being forced out of their homes and lands , but in the long run it produces stability . 
   let 's say that if golden dawn gets in power in greece and they start a war with tukey , then turkey can ethnically cleanse western thrace of greeks , regardless of the fact that not everybody there is a neo-nazi ? 
  if democratically elected ( like hitler ) then the burden lies to the entire state regardless who they voted for . 
  one of the evils of democracy . 
  :-) ethnic cleansing is not a-ok . 
  i do n't like what happened to the expelled germans . 
  btw check what i found : [ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g0xyoseza8] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g0xyoseza8 ), 
  i suppose that since germany started the war this is a form of justice . 
  payment for the invasion . 
  besides `` expulsions were initiated by nazi germany in occupied poland '' and the expulsions of the germans were ( from what i gather ) largely peaceful , not a genocide ( like the armenian genocide ), 
   should half of poland be given back to the germans ethnically cleansed after ww2 ? 
  there could be some other form of compensation . 
  i am not familiar the the poland issue you mention . 
  one was invaded and is still occupied against all international law locals did n't choose it . 
  in kosovo they wanted out . 
  remove turks from northern cyprus and let turk-cypriots decide for themselves . 
  not the same . 
   why ? 
  you can have a democratic turkey that respects minority right without creating a region called kurdistan well if the kurds are ok with it , so be it . 
   today 's demographic realities make this obsolete demographic realities ? 
  what about justice ? 
  macedonia has nothing to do with it . 
  since turkey recognized the split of kosovo from serbia , it should allow the same for kurds . 
  maybe after they stop occupying northern cyprus , recognize the armenian genocide , let a free kurdistan be created , give back stolen territories to the armenian people , and much more ... 
  do n't hold your breath . 
  cool . 
  thanks for the tip . 
  newbie here . 
  [ this ] ( http://aegeanhawk.blogspot.com/2012/05/blog-post_21.html ) is the original greek article, 
  sorry everyone , i am kind of new posting here . 
  this was n't supposed to be a self post , i pasted the link . 
  my browser must be broken or i did something wrong . 
  i did n't write it , but i kind of agree with it . 
  [ here ] ( http://aegeanhawk.blogspot.com/2012/05/blog-post_21.html ) is the original greek blog-post . 
  also in the translation i pasted there are no bullet points just dashes . 
  somehow reddit interprets these as bullets . 
  do n't know how to fix it . 
  oops , post fail , i think i fixed it now . 
  just to remind everyone that the bailout cheques mentioned in the video are loans with interest . 
  not free money . 
  there are profits for those that lend greece . 
  the high interest does n't help solving the crisis . 
  literary masturbator but we mean someone is an asshole when we use it . 
  the guy that said this is a malakas . 
  ignore him . 
  spend on infrastructure , it , production ( factories etc. ), 
  stuff that will help repay the debt in the long run , and put people to work now . 
  if european members of this union do n't want to get involved in a greece turkey conflict then this union ( not even an alliance ) is just economic exploitation in my eyes . 
  since greece ca n't tax german products , ca n't print its own money , now that it needs to , what is the point ?
