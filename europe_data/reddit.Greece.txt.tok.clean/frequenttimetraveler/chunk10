  this subreddit has a lot of issues with censorship , see relevant posts in / r/europemeta, 
  there are many people who are becoming skeptical of the eu . 
  i see a problem with the defacto german leadership that the eu has for the past decade . 
  it seems decisions are basically made with german interests in mind , with france simply nodding . 
  brexit is a big loss to eu 's pluralism , as we lost a major liberal partner . 
  you see something similar in the way this this very subreddit is run , which has an official rule to not push any agenda other than the pro-eu agenda for example . 
  as for its politics , eu has no strong leadership , it 's constant design by committee . 
  design by committee is by definition regression to the mean , which means mediocrity . 
  that 's why it does n't feel like an ambitious project that people can be inspired to support . 
  economically , there are already 2 europes now , north ( and some central ) and south with different economies that do not converge . 
  that would not be a problem if eu could become a transfer union , but imho eu is not ready to become a transfer union any time soon , as the cultures and economic attitudes are still different . 
  the fact that eu countries are not converging makes one skeptical whether alternative unions would fit better ( e.g. 
  eu of the north - eu of the south ) . 
  i do believe that trade and economic unions are all-too-important in today 's world , but i am not convinced that radical integration will work beyond the short-term . 
  [ no its this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frr65aeifs8 ), 
  are they really prevalent ? 
   nevertheless , the data show that 3,481 children were married in new jersey between 1995 and 2012 . 
  most were age 16 or 17 and married with parental consent , but 163 were between ages 13 and 15 , meaning a judge approved their marriages . 
  but according to reddit , there wo n't be any good jobs left after the robots take over , and europe is aging fast , so these young men and their kids are ideally positioned to work for old austrians ' pensions . 
  ah europe , always leeching from other people . 
  i agree . 
  even in arab countries , they reserve the * front * part of the train for ~ ~ lesser pe ~ ~ women and children . 
  that sounds weird . 
  did they attend the same classes ? 
  or was it a boys-only school and a girls-only school ? 
  that is another great case for a very significant monument that is entirely away from its natural place . 
  however the altar was at least undug and reconstructed by the germans themselves with full legal permission to take the findings to the berlin museum . 
  even germans themselves at the time [ were not happy realizing that they were taking an entire monument away ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pergamon_altar#from_discovery_to_presentation_in_berlin ) . 
  the parthenon marbles were not discovered by elgin , they were taken from plain sight , slyly , [ with a dubious firman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elgin_marbles#legality_of_the_removal_from_athens ) from indifferent ottoman authorities . 
  both monument appropriations come from a period of rivalry of great powers which wanted to show off who is the biggest looter of all . 
  it 's a shame really that history has not been physically restored , 100 years later . 
  it 's more about the integrity of the monument . 
  to have such a big and integral part of the monument so far away is just wrong an an aesthetic level . 
  but you might need a visa soon, 
  are you saying that ribbons , colored avatars and prayers do n't solve our problems ? 
  you must not be from uk, 
  uk is okay with theft ? 
  let 's hope this one does n't collapse for the same reason . 
  i dont think they give a shit about their religion . 
  it 's about appearing to respect others ' religion, 
  disgusting , racist decision, 
  the purpose of this thread is to show the absurdity of the law which was clearly ill-thought of, 
  that law was basically asking for it . 
  [ yes ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/istanbul#alternative_forms ), 
  it must be hell in your head, 
   turk against the greeks for over a thousand years . 
  the ottoman conquests started in ~ 1300  constant war , strife and conquest at the hands of the turk against the greeks the byzantine empire had many enemies , including the west , and at one point they declared that `` sultan 's turban is better than papal tiara '' . 
  there was a lot of war but not * constant war * after the ottoman conquest . 
  they are our historically enemy , but we have remarkable peace for almost a century now . 
  the generation of people who were expatriated are now almost dead . 
  it 's dumb to give into erdogan 's neo-sultanism . 
   are you an example of what greece is producing now ? 
  soft , uneducated , unwilling to see an enemy when centuries of death were laid upon your people by them ? 
  greece produces olives and feta . 
  why do people keep saying that ? 
  it 's literally the same name . 
  the history of the modern greek state starts in 1821 and the turkish state starts in 1923 . it 's a little off topic to consider that what alexander the great did has something to do with modern turkish militarism in the region . 
   from the invasion of troy ... alexander the great . . are you sure they were fighting turks ? ^ / s, 
  we 've had wars and an invasion in cyprus . 
  no conflict in the last 10 years , [ a few incidents ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek%e2%80%93turkish_relations#1928-1954 ) , but nothing like the thousands of deaths in the israeli-arab rivalry . 
  speak not of what you do n't know, 
  it 's only half a joke , it 's a legitimate question after reading the article :  police decided to move in amid concerns that the alleged cell was planning a similar attack in venice, 
   edit : also how do you know they are greek ? 
  well the house is white, 
  the jihadists were planning to drive a gondola against pedestrians ? 
  not common . 
  almost european-level uncommon i would say . 
  actually for cases that are within the responsibility of the mufti , the islamic law takes precedence over civil code , as ruled by the supreme court : https://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/apr/10/sharia-greece-human-rights-inheritance-law, 
  that 's something i have n't heard before - that tourism negatively affects the rest of the economy . 
  i ca n't see why you ca n't have a big tourist sector alongside others - like france . 
  the problem is not so much that tourist sector is too big , but that the other sectors are not developed . 
  i agree with you to the extent that tourism is a like a natural resource - it can become a curse , but tourism is like 20 % of the greek gdp . 
  for decades turkey has been doing this kind of pseudo-macho diplomacy with greece . 
  it 's strange to see them using it in the international field - they probably do n't realize how ridiculous it sounds . 
  i hate the heat . 
  i spend my summers cursing while sweating like a pig . 
  i understand that some people want to protect their jobs ( in vain , imho ) , but i wonder if this has more to do with you recent ` affair ' with the netherlands . 
  while i agree that tourism alone ca n't save greece , i do n't understand why this is not good . 
  we have a nazi party now , so they can call us nazis too . 
  athos is an automomous state-within-a-state , so they can do that . 
  greece is also the only european country where sharia law is applied ( in certain matters only , for a muslim minority ) . 
  but it 's a market . 
  a hint : overcomplicated vat regulations discourage sellers from selling within the eu through amazon . 
  eu favors the big guys here instead of the small ones , due to a mountain of complicated accounting . 
  there is even a startup to fix the mess : http://www.taxdoo.com/docs/en/ . 
  shocking, 
  gbp is down , british memes were cheaper . 
  i believe for further unification we need our cultures to align first . 
  as they say , politics is downstream from culture , and europe 's people are still stubbornly traditionalists when it comes to their native culture . 
  so political unification will have to wait until it becomes what people want . 
  so many beautiful places in rome, 
  eu is united . 
  the question is whether it should go on to become a federal state . 
  is n't it a double negative ? 
  if so , it should mean `` without without regard '', 
  its not like that . 
  when someone is giving you a choice between ` unite or perish ' , it means there is no third option , or somehow they will make it so that there is no third option . 
  it 's a passive-aggressive threat . 
  it says ` or perish ', 
  eu 's motto is `` united in diversity '' .
