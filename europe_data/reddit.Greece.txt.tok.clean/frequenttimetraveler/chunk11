  i like that , lets stick to that , stop shoving threats down our throats . 
  [ totally ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/join,_or_die ), 
  thanks for saying that . 
  clearly death only matters if it makes us feel * good * about our convictions . 
  and in the end , what matters in life is to feel good , who needs reality . 
  all the more reason to visa-free visit our beaches instead, 
  you only say that because nobody wants to visit your beaches !, 
  what if we do n't allow your laptops on board ? 
  if it was privileged , it was relatively privileged , but not greatly privileged . 
  the eu at least in 80s/90s was ( is ? ), 
  accessible to most europeans regardless of class i think , and indeed to poor classes too ( e.g. 
  in my country , farmers benefited from subsidies , and mang lower/middle class people were able they send their children to study in uk ) . 
  the problem imho is that , after a certain point when the alignment of eu with neoliberal ideas about the primacy of markets became the norm , and that allowed corporate interests to lobby it to maintain monopolies or to hinder competition via regulation . 
  let me spare you the trouble : 24/3 : erdogan says cyprus convention of 1878 was illegal 25/3 : erdogan says the greeks have to pay rent for the aegean 26/3 : erdogan burns the treaty of sevres , says he wants back iraq 27/3 : erdogan says armenian genocide did not happen because armenia does not exist 28/3 : erdogan says georgia is now in the us . 
  29/3 : erdogan declares himself sultan and starts the ottoman war 2 via skype 29.5 / 3 : reddit goes wtf , downtime rises to to 79 % . 
  30/3 : putin admits they hacked erdogan , and turns him off . 
  good and bad do not really covary with amounts of blood, 
  i dont get what he was trying to say directly ? 
  i do n't think what he said was a big deal , ( we 've heard worse ) , and i m against people censoring themselves anyway . 
  it was not a bad choice of words either : all other things being equal , certain ( unnamed ? ), 
  southerners was ( is ? ), 
  more likely to frivolously spend . 
  i believe we can say these things in europe without being perceived as bigoted or hateful . 
  honesty is a good start, 
  people use metaphors all the time, 
  its actually easier to spread malware to cars than to recruit terrorists, 
  they d be a prime target for terrorist hackers, 
  why is action against turkey the right thing to do ? 
  aqueduct people, 
  * alexander the lgbt slav, 
  downvoted ? 
  why is it not in the wiki ? 
  or the sidebar ? 
  i think the subreddit should define what it 's for . 
  it has 1000 pages of rules , but not a single line about `` what it 's for '', 
  its complicated because the communists were the bulk of resistance during the war . 
  unfortunately the civil war that followed left lasting scars until 1970-80 . in retrospect avoiding the eastern bloc was a good thing, 
  unfortunately the species went extinct , but we can always feel a warmth when looking at those magnificent photos of them . 
  yes , * the part of it that is not a loan from greek * lol, 
  literally a transformer, 
  afaik the byzantines considered themselves roman . 
  i m not even sure the term byzantine was used back then ^ wiki_agrees, 
  i think u re putting it right , and neither extreme is good . 
  i hear that the french are quite productive while not working too long . 
  and here , ladies , we have a specimen of the species * butthurtus portugesus *, 
  greek myths are still too nsfw for hollywood , or [ las vegas ] ( https://www.bustle.com/articles/94692-8-weirdest-sex-things-that-went-down-in-greek-mythology ), 
  lonely ... not so . 
  greek is almost everywhere in any science book you read . 
  i consider being handed down that language a great privilige . 
  behind almost every word there is an interesting story . 
  with the stress on * former *, 
  everyone wants a national myth . 
  there are enough of them for everyone in greek history . 
  unfortunately , letting every neighbor have their pick inevitably leads to idiots claiming territory from the modern state of greece . 
  hence the friction, 
  nvm , i m bad at jokes,

  the persians will pay for the wall, 
  grrrrr, 
  me too , until i [ found out this ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/navy-seal-copypasta ), 
  the empire was short-lived , but its impact on history was everlasting, 
  history belongs to dead people . 
  i wonder if there is a concept of ownership of history . 
  i always suspected `` white russians '' was a double entendre, 
  thats what she said, 
  its a harmless joke for many , but the problem is that when this kind of shit is exposed to masses of gullible idiots , it activates the gene that causes nationalism , a disease prevalent in the region , that often kills other people . 
  but i agree that anyone who needs to drink the blood of their ancestors to feel good about themselves , must be a very impotent person . 
  bad habits , most people are very unconscious of eating healthy ( despite healthy food being easy to find/grow ) , and then there is so much smoking ... bad habits are hard to change . 
  and hating is bad for you, 
  feb 29 would be best . 
  the point is it was never arbitrary, 
  balkan pop-folk , when it doesnt turn tragic can be pretty funny, 
  zeus was born here , and we have exclusive rights to his genes .

  enjoy also that ` flag ' never really flew anyway, 
  the gay slav, 
  in one way the thought that the thought counts is infuriating, 
  but but but 79/12 = 6.6 % . . they should have asked which god !, 
  well yes there are . 
  greece has a long , discontinuous history . 
  you understand where i m going : what definition of ` greek ' are you using ? 
  so where do the `` real greeks ( r ) '' originate from ? 
   selling blood of your ancestors is not an acceptable way to achieve anything . 
  thanks, 
  i m not sure that bringing up the past in tiny bits like this out of context helps in any way . 
  a major event for greeks and turks was the [ mutually agreed population exchange ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/population_exchange_between_greece_and_turkey ) . 
  400000 muslims also left greece . 
  populations moving is constant throughout history . 
  the ottoman empire was multiethnic , the turkish state is not , so its not surprising that other ethnicities gradually left . 
  the armenian genocide is another matter . 
  you re correct it 's 22 % . 
  i doubt it offsets the high cost of labour though . 
  clearly there are [ other reasons ] ( https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2016/12/21/sweden-heads-the-best-countries-for-business-for-2017/#3345155b7ecd ), 
  the ones i know i like . 
  kind of surprises me how half turkey falls for this shit, 
  is there a twitter for shit erdogan says or sth ?
