  there is absolutely no rational health reason to violate your son 's body like that . 
  just because you like your wang the way it is ( who does n't ? ), 
  does n't automatically mean your son prefers it . 
  also , the procedure is not banned , and even if it were , it would be about policing the parent 's hands , not the children . 
  based on absolute rational terms , there is no justification for using religion to raise a human . 
  but of course the world is not ideal . 
  we accept and tolerate religions because many billions of other people believe in them . 
   to practice your beliefs on your children edit : i do n't disagree with what you say , but religion is not really compatible with the logical , rigid structure of the law . 
  therefore , by its nature , religion tends to expand to other persons . 
  ideologies are weaker versions of the same thing , but we do n't call them religions because they are not instituted in the same way . 
  we even ban ideologies , but we wo n't touch religions . 
  if that were true , no religion would have survived . 
  freedom of religion is the right to brainwash people legally . 
  where do people give tattoos to infants ? 
  kind of surprised to see so many defending parental infant circumcision here . 
  are we sure it 's / r/europe ? 
  they re only talking about underage, 
  has it ever crossed your mind that you only have this opinion because u 've never had another option ? 
  how many adults choose to chop off their foreskins ? 
  the reason u see cut dicks in porn is because most porn is american , and americans have a cultish devotion to circumcision . 
  there 's nothing creepy about a foreskin , thats just your opinion . 
  personally i hate cut dicks in porn , because i can visibly see the cut lines , it 's a very obvious birthmark that , to me , provokes a certain revulsion , like seeing someone 's wounds does . 
  as you see aesthetics is subjective ; the problem is that i do n't think anyone ever asked a boy which penis he would like to have . 
  it s infants, 
  [ you just need to find the right angle ] ( https://www.tripadvisor.it/locationphotodirectlink-g187870-d244561-i134605188-bacaro_jazz-venice_veneto.html ), 
  i dont see why it 's entitled to it at all , but anyway whats the fundamental difference between 45 and 55 or 65 etc ? 
   corbyn would be better off fixing the tax loopholes he will never come to power , and he doesnt want it either . 
   45 % tax which is on the upper end of most oecd countries . 
  i disagree with corbyn 's stupid idea , on the other hand i do n't understand why tax brackets stop at 45 % . 
  there is no reason why taxation should not be a continuous monotonic curve . 
  when you cant get yourself up , bring everyone down . 
  nothing , bad joke, 
  i was referring to the spirit of the law . 
  by the letter of course it 's illegal ; however it would be interesting to see sci-hub being brought to court , because scientists would overwhelmingly defend it . 
  can you read ? 
  [ scientists would disagree ] ( http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/05/survey-most-give-thumbs-pirated-papers ) . 
  i do n't remember 87 % of artists being crazy for napster, 
  [ who 's downloading pirated papers ? 
  everyone ] ( http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/whos-downloading-pirated-papers-everyone ) [ in survey , most give thumbs-up to pirated papers ] ( http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/05/survey-most-give-thumbs-pirated-papers ), 
  ok but you did not explain why migration solves that problem, 
  preprints are not peer reviewed . 
  what we need is more publicly-funded publishing bodies . 
  the eu certainly has the capacity and the money to do it , under one of its many prestigious funding bodies , such as the erc . 
  there are plently of non-profit open access publishers too , like frontiersin.org and elifesciences.com , however they are not big enough yet to benefit from network effects . 
  illegal yes , but not `` napster-illegal '' most scientists support and use sci-hub , firstly , because it makes it easier to work , and also for ethical reasons . 
  napster took the work of artists who get paid by their work . 
  scientists dont get paid from the articles they publish , almost all of them get paid from state funding . 
  publishers just profit from an ancillary honors system that became a corporate behemoth in the 60s . 
  it 's really time to change that . 
  it 's like if the bbc decided to put its programming exclusively in netflix . 
  does it even make sense ? 
  i never did . 
  and fuck no , our work should be circulated for free on ethical grounds , because it was created in such a culture anyway . 
  springer/elsevier usually get a free book and sell it for $ 130 . 
  it 's utterly insane . 
  fake books, 
  people who write the chapters in most scientific books almost never get paid ( sometimes they get a free copy ), 
  yet , i did not see my ( generally easily agitated ) fellow greeks protesting in the streets for the prohibitively high taxation that is going to kill all entrepreneurship . 
  they prefer to have the ` malakes ' paying their taxes . 
  it has had the chance for at least 15 years , and as i happen to be in tech , i know it did not . 
  just look to our north , left and right and to the east ( israel ) . 
  sorry , greece does have a work ethic problem , and i m not going to pretend i do n't see it . 
   if you think work ethic is a problem with greeks work ethic is a problem * in greece * ftfy, 
  bets are wrong . 
  when i bet on trump , the odds were 4/1 , and just prior to election they were at ~ 2/1 i think . 
  i did place a bet on fn on 3/1 , now it has climbed to 2/1 so seems about right . 
  but i dont think afd has a chance . 
  and yes , / r/europe is a censorious , narrowminded center-left bubble . 
  see my [ remarks here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europemeta/comments/5ifi9l/uneven_handling_of_local_news_criterion/dba6nc6/ ) its exactly censorious bubbles like this that create the ` silent majority ' that you do n't see in polls , you do n't see in bets , until it surprises you in elections . 
  i try to look the bright side of it . 
  some of these men , who may have had extreme taboos about women , may now feel that touching a woman is not that a big deal as they made it out to be . 
  maybe they 'll even stop being creepy . 
   rhoisis does not mock isis itself it 's not meant to . 
  it mocks the `` real housewives '' . 
  should be obvious  if satire becomes propaganda , it becomes one-sided , and then it 's no longer satire = / =   satire does n't ` show both sides ' do you even logic , sir ? 
   are just ` stupid ' rather than upset , manipulated , even brainwashed . 
  people who do these things are stupid . 
  has absolutely nothing with them being women btw . 
   are being subject to misery . 
  subject themselves . 
  ftfy and it 's not even about the persons that these actors represent . 
  the situations they depict are so ass-backwards and stupid that its funny, 
  i 'm just quoting yourself :  it 's not a ` satire ' of anything , least of all isis - if you hypothetically showed this to an isis member , they 'd say ` yeah that seems about right ' . 
  it does n't provoke anyone but the victims . 
   i 'm saying that for a woman to feel so awful that moving to a totalitarian warzone seems like a better option than her current situation , she must be going through some shit . 
  that could be mental illness , it could be alienation , she could have been manipulated by isis propaganda and lies . 
  i found it funny because it makes fun of women who were stupid enough to think that moving from uk to syria to join jihad would be less oppressive . 
  oppressed once by the situation you are in , you re a victim , oppressed twice trying to escape from it , you 're laughing stock . 
  it 's like those cartoons where the mouse avoids a trap only to be caught in a bigger one . 
  i do n't choose to feel sorry for laughing . 
  if that offends you , none of my business . 
  i urge you to wake up to reality . 
  i like your defiance , but your ideas are dangerously wrong . 
   there 's nothing to fear isis kills cartoonists here and there [ for mocking them ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/25/middleeast/jordan-writer-nahed-hattar-killed/ ) , or for mocking the islamic faith that they want to appropriate . 
  there is no point talking in the abstract or with metaphors here . 
  isis aims to terrorize by inciting fear into culture and into satire as well . 
   acknowledge your own biases what is your bias ? 
  if you care about mine , it 's libertarian  satire literally exists in order to lampoon a position and effect social change by providing an argument against it . 
  satire exists to mock . 
  explicitly not to provide arguments for or against .
