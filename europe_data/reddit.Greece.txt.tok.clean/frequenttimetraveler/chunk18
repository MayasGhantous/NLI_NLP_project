  the problem is that you 're not suggesting something instead of no panic . 
  you say `` roses are red , everything is fine '' , i.e. 
  you push the problem under the rug . 
  we do n't really have ` nationalism ' in europe any more after the breakup of communist countries . 
  we have ethnic nationalism . 
  you 're free to like that vicious version of savage tribalism , but i disagree . 
  if we are going to divide the world again , i do n't think the national labels are fit anymore . 
  just look at people in europe , and how willing we [ are to fight for our nation ] ( http://gallup-international.bg/en/publications/2015/220-win-gallup-international%e2%80%99s-global-survey-shows-three-in-five-willing-to-fight-for-their-country ) . 
  my bet is on something smaller than nation-states . 
  but i dont know what . 
  yes the apocalyptic prophecies are ridiculous . 
  what about the prudent voices that want a more sane immigration policy though ? 
  in eastern orthodox tradition , christmas is the second-major religious celebration ( the easter is `` the big one '' ) . 
  in my island it is customary to bake [ melomakarona ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/melomakarono ) and [ kourampiedes ] ( http://www.neolaia.gr/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/kourampiedes.gif ) the days before . 
  yesterday we slayed a pig and today we re preparing the sausages . 
  children would go around the neighborhood knocking the door , and singing christmas carols in kind of trick-or-treating ( u can make a good chunk of money like that as a kid ) . 
  christmas day is basically spent eating and catching up with the entire extended family . 
  good thing it was n't a somalian newspaper then . 
  how about doing some actual background-checks , identify high risk individuals , some assimilation training etc. 
  you know , the scientific approach, 
  you do n't need to jump from one extreme to the other . 
  nationalism is a thing of the past, 
  if more people die than last year , it 's a problem . 
  stop pretending . 
  alright , i 'll bite . 
  you honestly miss the 80s ? 
  this is [ a graph of victims of terrorism in europe ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/ebpvneb ) . 
  in case you do n't see it , since the mid-90s we are having a good time in europe , optimistic and tolerant to each other . 
  we were on track to completely eradicate our violent hatred for each other , and that is a good thing ( i do n't miss the 80s at all ) . 
  then we have a complete setback the past 2 years with senseless violence and what 's more that violence was predictable , predicted , and largely self-inflicted . 
  as you claim to be a person qualified according to your criteria ( although you do n't have a country flair ) , who presumably knows their shit about the 80s , please go ahead and educate us why we should miss the 80s . 
  my post was sarcasm, 
  wow i now realize the mods deleted our comments . 
  wtf mods ? 
  we were n't being insulting ( just sarcasm on my part ) . 
  i do n't like this . 
  europe is supposed to be pro-free speech . 
  i do n't like this at all . 
  look i agree with you about not generalizing but we can specialize . 
  at least acknowledge we have many different groups of immigrants with different backgrounds that must be accommodated differently . 
  but plz do n't suggest we should ignore facts because it affects people . 
  that 's what facts are supposed to do ; we want a rational society . 
  i m not interested in arguing further ; there is nothing more to be said . 
  you deleted your responses to my linked comment because your narrative was n't working out . 
  i think you do n't reason rationally , so , no thanks . 
  robbing someone and throwing them off a 8m tall cliff ? 
  the guy clearly wanted to kill her, 
   that people that did not hurt a fly do n't get attacked by dickheads that 's an emotional appeal and it we should n't throw all logic out the window because our ends justify it . 
  it is in fact a rape culture as the stats show , not a fallacy of composition . 
  it being a rape culture doesnt mean all people rape , but it is something to take into account when you decide to accept hundreds of thousands of refugees from the region . 
  [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5iacrx/man_who_raped_child_in_swimming_pool_because_it/db6scjr/ ), 
  the title should n't be in french though . 
  i appreciate it too - and i try to post whenever i find one . 
  but an english translation is necessary in order to have some actual discussion, 
  i wonder how he didnt pass a single passport/id control through his journey . 
  he was wanted by the police ffs !, 
  edit : wtf how did germany accept this ` refugee ' who was wanted by greek police . 
  there is no cooperation ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rape_in_pakistan#child_sexual_abuse https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btltrt_wa0m&amp;t=1s please , twist reality again about how this is not a rape culture . 
  i m enjoying it and try not deleting your comments this time, 
  you 're joking , but we do n't get that much back from our taxes , it 's like donation . 
  how many guys is acceptable then ? 
  now i understand why he said he ` didnt know the kid did not consent ' . 
  it was another trick . 
  i just despise the lawyer who did this, 
  human nights do not grow on trees . 
  it 's a western construct , which we try to impose to the entire earth . 
  unfortunately i do n't think they teach human rights in rural poor middle east . 
  the question is , do any of the refugees/immigrants who are undocumented receive a crash course in western standards when they arrive here ? 
  i am pretty sure this iraqi really did n't think it was a big deal to rape a child , but no-one told him so either . 
  of course it is considered very politically incorrect to do a crash course in western ethics to `` cultured people '' , but i think it could save lives . 
   the law predates the government no , the law was passed by the syriza government ( you see the date ! ) . 
  also , the judge ordered 10 years . 
  it 's the law that allowed him to leave early . 
  the government = the russians, 
  who s amy green ? 
  anyway the law is extremely leniant - a 20 year term is really 7 years max , 10 years becomes 2 years for underage etc. 
  even with life sentences - only multiple convictions of murder end up with real life sentences . 
  the reason is 1 ) the congestion of the prisons , 2 ) that the greek legislation has too many laws that lead to unreasonable long prison sentences , and the lawmaker took this into account . 
  the law had been criticized by the judicial , but supported by the prison workers , who considered it necessary for the decongestion . 
  this is not the first criminal who commits murder after being released with this law . 
  as i understand the afghan did 2 years in prison and was released on bail , but without restriction to leave the country ( which he did ) . 
  i hope the german system 's more reasonable . 
  the same article , in english : http://www.politico.eu/article/the-eurozone-will-be-just-fine/ edit : ca n't you please post the english link instead ? 
  this is an english-language subreddit , it 's gon na be pretty rough if it becomes a 27-language sub, 
  title is not inaccurate , there may not be another appropriate english link , and there is already some interesting discussion here . 
  what 's the point of deletion ? 
   it 's not eu fault but it 's to their peril, 
   run their own country run their own country * down * , you mean , because that 's what all our democratically elected govts did . 
  it 's democracy without rule of law and accountability . 
  edit : it has been confirmed by the police . 
  fingerprints matched . 
  greece has given up part of its sovereignity for the bailouts . 
  this is not news, 
   worst rail strike in two decades thats a pretty low bar to cross, 
  eheheh . 
  well not really , the eurozone has covered for that, 
  summary/translation : the new element concerns the identity of the perpetrator , who apparently is the same person who had attacked a 20-year old student in mouragia region corfu knocking her to grab her bag . 
  the man had thrown the girl into the void from a height of eight meters , sending her to the hospital with severe bodily injuries . 
  the foreign perpetrator was arrested , stating that they are 17 years old and had been sentenced to 10 years ' imprisonment for attempted murder .
