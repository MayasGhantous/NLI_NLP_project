  however , as stated to protothema.gr by lawyer maria eleni nikopoulou , he managed to achieve the release of using the paraskevopoulos law for the decongestion of prisons !, 
  specifically , as stated by the lawyer of the afghan perpetrator : `` indeed it is the same person who allegedly killed his 19-year old in germany and attacked the 20-year old student in corfu . 
  although he was convicted to ten years in prison for attempted murder and had been transferred to prison in volos , he managed to be released making use of favorable provisions of the paraskevopoulos law for the decongestion of prisons '' . 
  the afghan was released on 31 october 2015 under the provisions of law 4322/2015 on bail on condition to appear at the police station of his permanent residence once a month . 
  the young afghan after making use of the paraskevopoulos law stated his permanent residence in athens and specifically in agios panteleimonas area , and he reported until the february of 2016 when he violated bail and did not appear in the police station of the area declared . 
  since then , the greek police is looking for him . 
  -- end translation -- it 's mindboggling that they did n't manage to register this murderer 's fingerprints . 
  we need more eu help with the registration of immigrants . 
  you 're probably all sick and tired of our drama ( me too ) , so a tldr : - eurozone promised a small debt relief - greece has increased taxes to the roof past year , and as a result they exceeded revenue targets - the government decided to give the surplus to pensioners rather than to the unemployed ( without telling the eurozone ) - eurozone angry , they ` froze ' the plan for debt relief, 
  if they stopped doing cringeworthy stuff like this or forcing women to undress in beaches , isis might stop attacking them . 
  at a certain point , robots will be designing themselves . 
  robot owners will be like land owners , owning the robots but not doing much else , and essentially extracting rents . 
  at that point i suppose the model will change, 
   family and taking care of each other i suppose its more complicated . 
  anecdotally , for the crisis-related suicides i 've heard of ( there have been some ) , it was more the social stigma or feeling of failure to protect their family , rather than individualistic reasons . 
  also , japan has family culture but also [ sky high suicides ] ( http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/suicide/suicideprevent/en/ ) . 
  i wouldnt believe that . 
  suicide is taboo in religious societies and unlikely to be reported, 
  there are worse places on earth i suppose but not everyone wants to kill themselves http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/suicide/suicideprevent/en/ what does the govt do for the suicide problem ? 
  just look at sunny pictures , dont die !, 
  anyway i wonder if there 's a genetic component to it ? 
  you might be murican , we call them communists here, 
  i 'm sure it was not intentional ( joke ) this has more info , can an italian translate ? 
  cold is time for some rubbing to get warm . 
  we 'll never die motherfuckaz !, 
  seriously guys up north , whats wrong with u, 
  finland already has huge welfare , it 's probably one of the the most unfit countries to run this experiment ( have money to throw away ? 
  at least throw them in greece , 
  ... and the vcs who invested in the robots and the people who make them reaping all the profits . 
  american businessmen love ubi because it will guarantee them infinite customer base forever . 
  they will always be able to use their government lobbying to keep ubi at the minimum level required for them to become richer and the rest of the world to shut it . 
  meanwhile , social mobility will die and inequality will reach a permanent peak . 
  piketty on the subject :  the question of justice is not simply a matter of 530 euros or 800 euros a month . 
  if we wish to live in a fair and just society we have to formulate more ambitious objectives which cover the distribution of income and wealth in its entirety and , consequently , the distribution of access to power and opportunities . 
  our ambition must be that of a society based on a fair return to labour , in other words , a fair wage and not simply a basic income . 
  question if he got deported , is this even considered a crime in iraq ? 
   amir confessed to the attack in initial police questioning , telling them it had been a `` sexual emergency '' because he had not had sex for four months . 
  explain plz how it is not his culture ( i 'm not talking about race or religion ), 
  oh thank fuck there is also prison rape in europe . 
  i 'm relieved that makes it totally ok now, 
  [ this ] ( http://www.damncoolpictures.com/2009/03/5-star-prison-in-austria.html ) is a prison in austria . 
  i would imagine even ' 4 stars ' worse will be nothing like a shithole, 
  you 're wrong in some places it s an acceptable [ tradition ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btltrt_wa0m&amp;t=1s ), 
  yeah but they did n't cost e5000 back home . 
  damn eu is expensive, 
  thank god , ` natives ' do it too . 
  i mean , fuckin great i m so relieved, 
  do they think the same about boys ? 
  or do these boys grow to be ` proper men ', 
  unfortunately there were no goats in the pool . 
  and this was an emergency , his balls would explode, 
  nooooo why did you do this . 
  can not unsee . 
  abort abort, 
  nah he s not young enough ( plus he s not going to us prisons ), 
  i think we should be considerate of this person 's [ unique culture ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btltrt_wa0m&amp;t=1s ) , while acknowledging that what he did was illegal . 
  it is a fault of eu authorities that they failed to inform this person that doing that is illegal . 
  it would be disrespectful to say that it was immoral , as it would imply that we are pushing a moral code to the guy , i mean eww guys . 
  we should treat all moral codes to the same respect that they deserve uh-kay ? 
  ^ / obvious ^ s, 
  and so are women , so , whats left ? 
  its what you do when u dont know how to wank, 
  of course , right ? 
  the ` neuro ' and the ` seuro ', 
  fair point , though judging from the rise of fn , i m not sure this `` equality by obscurity '' worked . 
  clouds ? 
  what do you smoke up there ? 
   tend to come from the extremist end and it is to no fault of their own . 
  the rest of the political spectrum is deeply head-in-the-sand, 
  a split between southern and northern euro would make more sense, 
  the fact that eu countries actively try to prevent the collection of such statistics doesnt help . 
  people have a right to know who their compatriots are . 
  edit : here is some more recent data from eurostat : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/migration_and_migrant_population_statistics, 
  alright . 
  but you know what i mean , germany is not afraid of canadian competition that much, 
  how so ? 
  canada does not make cars, 
  i cant blame germans for not wanting to bail out the entire south, 
  la serenissima has the most amazing history ever , including political history . 
  they took the concept or republic seriously , and wouldnt hesitate to condemn a [ traitor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marino_faliero ) to eternal disremember . 
  at a point , here is how they selected their doge :  new regulations for the elections of the doge introduced in 1268 remained in force until the end of the republic in 1797 . 
  their object was to minimize as far as possible the influence of individual great families , and this was effected by a complex elective machinery . 
  thirty members of the great council , chosen by lot , were reduced by lot to nine ; the nine chose forty and the forty were reduced by lot to twelve , who chose twenty-five . 
  the twenty-five were reduced by lot to nine and the nine elected forty-five . 
  then the forty-five were once more reduced by lot to eleven , and the eleven finally chose the forty-one who actually elected the doge . 
  [ 1 ] none could be elected but by at least twenty-five votes out of forty-one , nine votes out of eleven or twelve , or seven votes out of nine electors . 
  [ 3 ] a detailed description of this process , and the ceremonial procession that followed , is preserved in martin da canale 's work les estoires de venise ( english translation by laura k. morreale , padua 2009 ) . 
  i live in one of their former conquests , and we have a number of examples of beautiful venetian architecture . 
  such unique city . 
  rick steves has a number of nice videos about her : https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=rick+steves+venice, 
  so they just ` happen ' to be in touch . 
  the result is the same . 
  i thought after trump we would be more careful with this stuff, 
  you probably missed the graph where france has 61 % the most unfavorable view of eu , trailing only greece . 
   comparison to ancient greece do n't forget that pericles was also a demagogue . 
  and the athenians had a swift response to stagnation : they elected most of their ` establishment ' by random lot . 
   so , is anyone protesting this ? 
   the [ commission was surprised ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/214436/article/ekathimerini/news/commission-not-fully-aware-of-greek-pms-declarations-over-special-benefits ) , but populists gon na be populists . 
  i would say the main factor is that it did n't matter anymore . 
  with divorce [ rates ~ 50 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/divorce_demography ) , the traditional family is no longer the stable pillar of society that it used to be .
