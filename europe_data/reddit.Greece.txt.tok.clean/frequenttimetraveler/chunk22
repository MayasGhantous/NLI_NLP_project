  umm . 
  / the_donald is an online trump rally , it 's not for discussion , their sidebar is abundantly clear . 
  it 's free speech for speech that is supporting trump , because that speech is banned literally everywhere else . 
  / europe is a default debate subreddit . 
  i hope u re being sarcastic , / thedonald is free only for donald supporters, 
  ca n't u just downvote it ? 
  do we really have to ban everything ? 
  but those bremain arguments were some pundits ' and politicians ' rational opinion . 
  some brexiters reasoned that the pundits had failed them so many times , that they could not trust/believe them anymore , so their rational decision was to vote brexit ( for higher optionality ) . 
  others might know that eu was actually a source of prosperity , but because they see none of this prosperity while the rich do , they chose to vote against it ( i.e. 
  they wanted to reduce inequality even if it was to the detriment of the country 's gdp ) . 
  of course there were also people who , were intentionally and emotionallly acting against their own interests in order to bring down others with them ( the suicide bomber option ) . 
  the point is that an `` objectively rational '' position does not exist when interests collide . 
  and what position was the best is usually decided a posteriori, 
  for starters the ban list is a bit restrictive : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/disallowed_domains that list is not complete , e.g. 
  zerohedge is also banned, 
   what is rational for one person is totally irrational for the other u mean irrational from the other 's perspective ? 
  what does it matter as long as people act semi-rationally with respect to their own intersts ? 
  hello . 
  is this the right way to troy ? 
  he wo n't use the law , he will use the verdict for free publicity, 
  hes not guilty of hatred . 
  `` inciting discrimination '', 
  i meant ubi for the animals, 
  kreta, 
  thanks for pointing that out , person who never tried it, 
  in english ? 
  and he sounds like a reddit troll too . 
  also , my god , terrible hair . 
  would not vote, 
  yeah sorry about that . 
  i wonder why the nl would be so interested in ubi ? 
  most of them had a predetermined plan and preferred country of destination . 
  anyway , they wo n't rot in greece , they will just slowly find their way back into europe . 
  do n't expect the greek government ( especially the current one ) to make swift ( meaning < 2-3 years ) deportations , if at all . 
  [ apetor drinks vodka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ibo1qhrqqe ), 
  just realize that you could not build reddit.com in any eu country . 
  what do you mean `` definition of hate speech '' . 
  i mean your legal version :  `` the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a state to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force , or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action . '', 
  is there another `` hate speech '' that can be prosecuted ? 
  that 's the american definition of hate speech, 
  keep your memes off our islands or we 'll grexit you . 
  * grabs the popcorn , and the souvlaki *, 
  ... for the animals ? 
  to morocco, 
  is n't that only going to bring more publicity to him ? 
  make him seem like a martyr for saying out loud what many of his supporters think ? 
  worked for trump , worked for farage . 
  here is a trick to fight nationalists : speak to their audience , not to the politicians themselves . 
  but people have stopped believing in the power of convincing people in the west . 
  populists love this kind of intrigue , and he knows how to play the game . 
  sad but true . 
  scratch that , truth ca n't be sad, 
  if you can convince people that your hateful ideology is a proper religion , then yes , people will be tolerant to you, 
  if people were enraged anyway , and genuinely want a change of establishment , how does unfree speech help then ? 
  would it be better to oppress them for 4 more years ? 
  the us does have protections against hate speech ; but imho europe has a free speech deficit . 
  and i think it will get worse after brexit . 
  i live in one of the most corrupt countries in europe . 
  people never publicly name names , even when they know of crimes or there will be ( and have been ) huge libel charges . 
  couple that with weak justice system and you have an authoritarians ' dream . 
  germany has strict blasphemy laws , i wonder if they are enforced :  ( 1 ) whoever publicly or by dissemination of writings ( \u00a7 11 par . 
  3 ) defames , in a manner suitable to disturb the public peace , the substance of the religious or world view conviction of others , shall be fined or imprisoned for up to three years . 
   ( 2 ) whoever publicly or by dissemination of writings ( \u00a7 11 par . 
  3 ) defames , in a manner suitable to disturb the public peace , a church established in germany or other religious society or world view association , or their institutions or customs , shall be punished likewise . 
  i 'm fine with bodybags , as long as other people are allowed to make fun of them . 
  omg they 'll punish the eu by becoming ireland !, 
  i m not asking you to . 
  but how would suppressing free speech alter the outcome ? 
  it would only enrage the disenchanted, 
  you can be civil and hateful or uncivil and unhateful ; one does not exclude the other, 
  maybe because free speech saved them from a disastrous hillary ? 
  how do you know , can you foresee the future ? 
  good faith is faith in something . 
  what is that ? 
  this subreddit surely ai n't helping, 
  i am in the same camp , and whatsmore , the 5 of us decided to raise our children in a species-neutral environment in our polyamory , multispecies family . 
  anything beyond `` passengers '' or `` cargo '' in trains and buses is really confusing for our ` family ' ( though we do n't use this antiquated notion anymore ) , and it 's really triggering the canines among us . 
  the entire world is individualist man .

  i think he s a little more likeable than angela, 
  but we dont have american-style freedom of speech in yurop, 
  for him its just more publicity . 
  i guess he will be laughing at those who feel vindicated by this . 
  has there been a historical precedent where refugees and immigrants ( which will all in the end become economic migrants ) have been forced to locate to where they can not find jobs ( and i do n't mean just greece , everywhere in the eu with high uneployment ) ? 
  i find even the idea that this will work idiotic . 
  it 's one of the problems that will not be solved by ` rules ' but by common sense .
