  greek-egyptian exercise in kasos-karpathos tomorrow begins the development of greek and egyptian aeronautical forces which will take part in a joint exercise of the two countries under the name `` medusa '' . 
  these maneuvers , which will take place in areas out of kasos , karpathos and in the wider area around crete seem to have annoyed ankara which issued a notam which argues that kasos is demilitarized area and concludes that exercises are not allowed in the region !, 
  in a provocative move , the turkish officers refer to kasos with its turkish name - tzompan - hinting that the island is another one of their `` gray zones '' !, 
  the central part of the aeronautical maneuvers of greek and egyptian armed forces will run from 6th to december 11th . 
  in this exercise the egyptians send a new french frigate type fremm , two gunboats , fighter aircraft f-16 and commandos who will co-exercise with greek special forces in underwater demolition . 
  in `` medusa '' , the greek fleet will be involved with the submarine papanikolis , a frigate , a gunboat and number of combat aircraft that will operate from crete where also will be redeployed egyptian -16 . 
  indicative of the importance given to the exercise by athens and cairo , is the fact that the exercises will be attended by the chief of the egyptian armed forces and the greek chief of defence admiral evangelos apostolakis . 
  the greek-egyptian exercise is part of the bilateral military cooperation with repetitive drills in the region of crete and the sea area east of egypt . 
  in case turkey attacks greece , it attacks all of them , ergo it attacks turkey . 
  nato needs a new article for these cases . 
  so why do n't they use army sources for their reporting ? 
  why not let the army decide on an official line to pass on to the media ? 
  the war in iraq went on for years under false pretenses , and the public opinion did not stop it . 
  what difference does it make if americans or europeans know the truth about a faraway war ? 
  `` reporting about syria is bad . 
  here 's how bernie could have won : '', 
  fair enough , but what is your information ? 
  kreta, 
  it was crap food anyway, 
  it was half in jest , but to be fair the wired article is overly optimistic . 
  we 've seen ai companies spring up in europe and then being taken over by american behemoths , so `` europe is leading the way '' sounds like wishful thinking . 
  `` absolutely elegant '' is a tad too much . 
  maybe a `` quite rational '' decision but admiting imminent defeat can never be elegant . 
  thanks for the lesson but when did i say neoliberalism is leftwing ? 
  elaborate plz, 
  fascism is when you forcibly silence people . 
  better be careful what u wish for, 
  what do people think about his role in france 's position in the eu ? 
  during the euro crisis it seemed france was always trailing the germans . 
   you need a big-ass single market . 
  as you said , we have a single market but it 's not a real single market . 
  pity we do n't use that advantage to create a huge rich entrepreneurial area . 
  but its not fake news when it fits our agenda, 
  there is evidence for that http://jaredbernsteinblog.com/full-employment-a-force-against-rising-inequality-and-stagnant-incomes/ http://equitablegrowth.org/equitablog/wages-full-employment-reducing-inequality/, 
  non-debtor nations are more likely to side with creditors , since they do n't want to pay for other peoples mistakes . 
  of course it 's not that simplistic . 
  to quote from the article i linked :  debtors in crisis countries may vote more for left than right , recognizing that bailing other people 's banks comes at their expense . 
  reciprocally , debtors in creditor countries may vote more for populists of the right , who want to enforce creditor contracts all the harder , so long as such enforcement always falls on foreigners . 
  yet the reality produced by these dynamics is more nebulous . 
  contemporary populism in europe breaks down the settled categories of left and right . 
  for example , the british labour party , even under jeremy corbyn , wants to stay in the eu and accepts the need for budgetary consolidation . 
  the french national front , in contrast , wants out of europe , argues for an expansionary fiscal policy that is more redistributive , and is against the trans-atlantic free trade treaty . 
  if you ignore the pronounced racism of the latter , which party is , in the minds of voters rather than intellectuals , more to the left ? 
  pitchforks and baseball bats ... who does that ? 
  i think they think it 's not gay even if you bottom lol, 
  hmm . 
  poland 's national debt is like 60 % and hungary 80 % so they are not debtor nations . 
  anyway i m no expert but if you are interested , this is the argument in full : http://www.elgaronline.com/view/journals/ejeep/13-2/ejeep.2016.02.06.xml, 
  the policy of austerity throughout southern europe is neoliberal . 
  or would you describe the policy of my country 's `` radical left '' government as leftist by any stretch of imagination ? 
  tsipras , brexit trump lepen , 5star , i think it all can be explained best by the end of neoliberalism through [ trumpism ] ( http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/11/18/mark_blyth_global_trumpism_and_the_revolt_against_the_creditor_class.html ) as a standoff between creditor and debtor nations in europe . 
  everyone will vote anti-establishment , but the creditor nations will go for populist right , and the debtor nations for the populist left . 
  i really hope the eu will not be used as a punch-bag for these antiestablishment movements , but otherwise they seem to be inevitable . 
  i think most people would agree with that . 
  oh yeah that s a common secret among them ; not that there s something intrinsically wrong with that, 
  certainly not . 
  google has many ai teams http://research.google.com/teams/, 
  i would think , if there is a divide , it 's around economic classes and not regions . 
  it 's pretty evident with trump and brexit for example that middle classes revolt to the rich 10 % because they are the ones less benefited by neoliberalism . 
  ca n't say i m surprised , the roma here are extremely segregated and typically do n't go to school . 
  it 's a very difficult demographic to penetrate . 
  it seems i missed the part where uk became the divided kingdom . 
   paid by repressive outside governments russia must be really really rich if they can pay half the planet . 
  who knew ? 
  maybe we should all move there, 
  i suppose the rest of britain is looking out for its own interests which are orthogonal to the extreme financialization of the uk . 
  and since uk is a democracy , the mayor should shut up and listen to the majority . 
  warns whom ? 
  what 's he gon na do ? 
  shut down their banks ? 
  its because op didnt put a link to the article , and the graph is misleading . 
  its not a survey in the 30s . 
  the surveys are from 1995-2014 . 
  because gays ca n't be killers ? 
  i doubt that . 
  the paper : http://www.journalofdemocracy.org/sites/default/files/foa%26mounk-27-3.pdf the article : http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/world/americas/western-liberal-democracy.html seems to be that as people grow older , they realize that democracy is not that bad after all . 
  young people are more likely to believe in anarchy/communism/far-right etc. 
  they do n't show the same survey from a different decade so we can compare if the curves have changed ( i think it 's suspect that have pooled the data from 2005-2014 and they dont compare with 1995 ) . 
  they show that there 's a general increase in `` democracy is bad '' , but that 's a lot more in the us and not europe . 
  i would think it s due to the rise of libertarianism/corporatism . 
  in short i have doubts about their conclusions . 
  i seriously do n't understand why more remote-workers do n't come to greece . 
  rents are real steal atm . 
  buying a house is still expensive though, 
  no because i realize 1 ) your real motives were economic and not hatred and 2 ) you 're not actually moving the island so we ca n't afford to hate each other, 
  this is as misleading as can be  respondents were asked whether having sexual intercourse without consent was justified in nine different circumstances . 
  at least one in ten respondents think intercourse without consent is justified if the person is drunk or using drugs ( 12 % ) , voluntarily goes home with someone ( 11 % ) , wears revealing , provocative or sexy clothing or does n't clearly say no or physically fight back ( both 10 % ) the percentage of people who checked at least one of the options was 27 % . 
  al jazeera says `` 27 % support rape '' . 
  horse shit source : http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm/resultdoc/download/documentky/75838 fuck you al jazeera with your fake news !, 
  `` isis gay porn '' would certainly sell well, 
  i wonder if reddit has tried to train some ai bots and measure how they fare compared to primates . 
  free speech does n't end in reddit, 
  u talking to me , honey ? 
  i do n't know , a love affair between two narcissists can never end well . 
  well if money is jesus , it 's about jesus, 
  everyone steals , but i do n't think christmas is about saturn anymore, 
  if i knew i 'd build it . 
  well my idea would involve replacing our social media with our personal rss feeds which we would self-publish and 3rd party websites could aggregate . 
  then we could use ai to combat the spam and trolling problems : a ` subreddit ' could train its own bot to recognize the kind of trolling and spam it does not want to have . 
  reddit 's ceo himself will edit your posts if you piss him enough .
