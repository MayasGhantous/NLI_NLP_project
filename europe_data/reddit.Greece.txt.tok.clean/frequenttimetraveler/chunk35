  it is the job of the army , and the coast guard to do rescue operations . 
  frontex and nato bases in the region could help . 
  at least when only public services are involved , it is clear who is to blame . 
  [ in another report ] ( https://cdn2.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2017/04/emergency-within-an-emergency-fxb.pdf ) for example , ngos have been accused of not reporting refugee child abuse for fear of `` losing their funding '' . 
  norther europeans will comfortably object to this of course , but such blind behavior is [ what enables this to happen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cia_eop2lvy ) . 
  for once , this year europe should get its shit together . 
  that always ends well, 
  you should write an entry about the blocking and put it in the wiki frontpage . 
  or just be a troll and make `` erdogan '' the article of the day . 
  [ citation needed ], 
  at least it 's not display : none, 
  about [ 13.7 % ] ( http://users.sch.gr/kassetas/names3.htm ) [ of greeks ] ( http://users.sch.gr/kassetas/names1.htm ) are having their name day today . 
  definitely swedish, 
  ca n't we just find a guy who lives in fyrom and is called alexander ? 
  we can change his surname to `` thegreat '' and problem solved forever . 
  alexander was gay . 
  all swedish men are gay . 
  alexander = swedish . 
  my logic is perfect and i proved you wrong . 
  the region was made up by city-states and kingdoms . 
  applying the idea of `` state '' and especially `` nation '' as we know them today is not really valid . 
  was that nation a part of the ancient united nations though ? 
  did the nation of egypt and the united states of mesopotamia recognize them ? 
   slavic macedonians . 
  they did not identify themselves as `` slavic macedonians '' until someone named them in the nationalist era . 
  also , how valid is `` macedonia '' as a geographical term ? 
  back in ancient greek times , there were no defined borders . 
  `` macedonia '' would be defined at any time as the current extent of the kingdom ruled by the king of macedons . 
  maybe he 's downvoted because ` macedon ' is not a geographic term , there was an [ ancient macedonian tribe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ancient_macedonians ) . 
  there were never self-identified `` slav macedonians '' . 
  the term `` macedonian '' was not used until very recently ( ~ 1900 ) to define the people of `` macedonia the country '' . 
  and regardless of the genetic composition of the people , they are not culturally roman or ancient macedon . 
  it would be dangerous ( considering we are talking about the balkans ) to refer to `` greek macedonians '' and `` slavic macedonians '' as if they are part of a greater whole . 
  if that were the case all poor countries would have more women in stem . 
  some do , some do n't , i think it 's cultural . 
  the soviet propaganda would develop a `` duty to scientific literacy '' to everyone indiscriminately . 
  the western propaganda spends more trying trying to bend science and universities to the `` needs of women '' than trying to convince women to pursue stem . 
  and frankly , women seem to be missing from some parts of stem , while they have almost normal participation in others ( e.g. 
  biology ) . 
   20 % less than men : it simply does not make sense for the husband to stay at home does this mean that e.g. 
  a woman doctor would get paid less than a man ? 
  is germany that left behind ? 
  maybe because other kinds of jobs ( e.g. 
  finance , services , commerce ) are more readily available to women in the west than in other regions ? 
  peer influence is also a big factor . 
  kids mimic their peers from very early age . 
   it has happened before it did n't really happen , those petitions accomplished nothing . 
  frankly , most greeks agree with those anti-church measures . 
  they are obviously fishing for votes as their downward spiral continues . 
   and the german downvotes arrived here , have a greek downvote, 
  i suppose the only reason is that , at the time of the enlightenment , it was impossible to ignore religion , despite the cognitive dissonance it caused . 
  blasphemy laws directly contradict to the freedom of expression . 
  finally we can have [ less boring temples ] ( http://ancient-greece.org/images/ancient-sites/delos/large/37.jpg ), 
  i think , if enough people organize behind such a movement , it can happen . 
  there are serious legal reasons why we should have this btw . 
  blasphemy laws, 
  close suez and gibraltar , and let it evaporate ... 
  nobody ever expects the factorial bot . 
  local anarchists . 
  they warned the authorities for the bomb . 
  it 's not very uncommon . 
  shut it austrians , and take the refugees . 
  they do n't want to stay here . 
  you built your welfare state , you pay for it now . ^ / s, 
  you believe people die of infected cavities in turkey ? 
  [ they could do better ] ( http://img.kiosko.net/2017/04/19/uk/sun.750.jpg ), 
  maybe it should have come before triggering brexit, 
  tell that to the displaced fish who were forced to immigrate, 
  is n't that a passive aggressive vote mainly addressed to belgians ? 
  sorry about that . 
  i think the eu could have reached across to the turkish people giving them a little more hope for their eu membership before the referendum , which might have helped making a case for a less-theocratic turkey . 
  excellent !, 
  i think its closer to the truth . 
  you re pretty talented for an anergos, 
  can you make a sped-up version ? 
  theresa will feel like she has the will of the british people behind her ... and europeans wo n't be able to play the `` thin margin '' card . 
  it matters for the negotiations, 
  i think the overly prolonged cult of personality of ataturk eventually damaged turkish democracy . 
  parties and ideologies should at some point transcend personalities to become ingrained in the public 's mind . 
  now he needs to keep the country united after this divisive result . 
  what to do , what to do ... play old school aegean islands tricks ... 
  just two ? 
  [ this is a nice documentary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3x1s_bgoec ) with easter traditions throughout southern europe . 
  the midnight before easter , [ it 's customary to fire up firecrackers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti3vugm-s-8 ) . 
  in general [ anything to do ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofjacmg8a_g ) with loud noise is appropriate , the bang somehow symbolizes the ` death of death ' . 
  the same night , it 's customary to [ burn a doll symbolizing judas iscariot ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl2hw_ck8gy ) . 
  those are fun things to do when u re a kid . 
  poor church, 
  it 's not like there 's a war on the border or a bunch of terrorist attacks . 
  surely they were thinking of the referendum . 
  its value is determined in auctions, 
  i do n't see a problem . 
  this troll feeds well on gays . 
  distrust for the church was strong well before that , because church used to meddle with politics , and because many ppl supported communism . 
  he was the only bishop who managed to gather such huge crowds though . 
  this is gon na be wild . 
  the bishop taking a naked erdogan [ out of the water ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/russian-baptism.jpg/1024px-russian-baptism.jpg ) and resting him on vladimir 's stronk arms, 
  i wonder how turks feel about this . 
  i still give him the benefit of doubt . 
  he actually led turkey to a place politically where people are not willing to accept another coup , and that is progress .
