  so if every member of islamic state is going to die a horrible death , who is going to build that state ? 
  ignorant shits , unlike those others who will go post on reddit . 
  probably not . 
  but i would wager terrorism of a single kind / for a single cause is . 
  that 's why people are justifiably worried . 
  why is everyone so in love with the past ? 
  as long as the rates are not declining , we have a problem . 
  this is how things should be looking like : http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/european/index.htm, 
  the martyrs of erdogan bridge . 
  will be a joke for decades . 
  he will remembered as the failed try-hard of personality cults . 
  my theory is because they experience slightly less gravity, 
  ok so what do you do to become dutch ? 
  even though i m average , i would support that . 
  2.2-2 .3 m maybe, 
  damn and i thought i was good at it . 
  i should start reading twice, 
  i am optimistic that humans will find the technology to fight it, 
  there is no objective definition of ` worse ' . 
  compared to the 90s europe is a lot more pessimistic and maybe sad . 
  you ca n't compare actual wars ( between consciously fighting armies and soldiers ) with terrorism . 
  if you mean the current decades it 's really not . 
  if you mean the distant past , comparing apples to oranges, 
  i doubt they would consider deporting existing citizens . 
  however putting a damper on immigration would change the dynamics radically . 
  naturalized immigrants are often hostile to new waves of immigration . 
  it 's a weird machiavellian divide-and-conquer strategy , i know , but it 's still a strategy . 
  he is being called out . 
  calling him out is not a strategy though . 
  eu could play its cards right . 
  not need . 
  the sea is already a good enough wall . 
  all that s needed is the political will to deport arriving immigrants right back . 
  is this any more likely than hell freezing over ? 
  demagogue politics and blaming foreign powers is popular in turkey for generations . 
   meanwhile being useless despite his megalomania he has delivered with regards to economy . 
  the irony is , if the eu did so , it would spur pro-european sentiments which would weaken him politically . 
  ... but he will be self-radicalized . 
  he read the quran , the dabiq , watched 100000 isis videos , and socialized at the mosque , all by himself . 
  no religious recruitment here . 
  so if they become terrorists they stop being muslims . 
  someone should let isis know that . 
  mentally ill people also do not have reasons to become mass killers . 
  they may turn violent , but it 's usually on a small scale . 
  it 's when they 're triggered and recruited that they become an outsize threat . 
   mental illness , loneliness and lack of perspective have always been connected with terrorism do you have actual data on that ? 
  yeah and the fuckin ' sunshine . 
  whats up with this summer thing . 
  ooh and the internet , so easy to find guns ... and those slutty europeans , ca n't they at least cover their legs ... ban them all, 
  http://www.comres.co.uk/polls/bbc-radio-4-today-muslim-poll/ maybe u ll laugh more, 
  yes , i was being sarcastic . 
  i think it ruins the fun to put ' / s ' there ( but i did :( ), 
  at the very least you acknowledge its problems . 
  i try to be openminded about it , but it seems that the islam as practiced in much of middle east is problematic and in need of reform . 
  if you have all these kinds of attacks you would expect religious leaders in europe to come forward using their religious powers ( i.e. 
  their interpretation of the quran ) to the damnation of the perpetrators ( or equivalent ) . 
  you would expect people to lobby and pressure the religious leaders to do so . 
  religion should be seen as a two-edged tool . 
  https://muslimstatistics.wordpress.com/2015/03/01/bbc-poll-49-of-muslims-endorse-hate-preachers-11-support-jihad-27-support-charlie-hebdo-execution/ you can find more on google . 
  i blame guns . 
  they have become too effective and too easy to use . 
  really ? 
  when ? 
  even when they were second generation immigrants , did they look assimilated to you ? 
  being born in europe does not a european make . 
   and the integrated muslim community i wonder what are the percentages of `` integrated muslims '' in europe, 
  i guess that 's how it is in canada . 
  the problem with european immigrant communities is that they view these attacks with toleration , if not with a sardonic laugh . 
  but ... more win for female leaders, 
  or maybe the center-right will adopt some anti-immigration rhetoric . 
  even if you ban islam , you will still have attacks from these people . 
  it 's probably more their upbringing and culture ( lack of respect for human life ) rather than the quran . 
  see , that pretentious attitude ( mosques supposedly being religious , yet that 's where the attacks are plotted ) does not help the muslims . 
  there have been population exchanges before , and peaceful ones . 
  in my country , it was after the war of 1922 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/population_exchange_between_greece_and_turkey what 's interesting is that those greek muslims and christian turks were very very well assimilated and nonviolent . 
  back then , the reason was a ( normal ) war that caused it . 
  today it 's the petrol-funded terrorism . 
   why should all muslims be held accountable ? 
  because apparently there is a lot of anti-western sentiment among them . 
  it the attacks are the tip of the iceberg , it shows that the iceberg is really really huge . 
  compare that with christian fundamentalists , they hate western values too , but it is not often that we see that tip . 
  i wonder if people actually went inside . 
  there 's just so many of them , it 's fair to say that a large percentage are unprepared to become immigrants and will want to go back . 
  one day, 
  http://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/household-appliances/refrigeration/fridges/smeg-fab10luj-tall-fridge-union-jack-10088133-pdt.html it 's an italian brand . 
  you 'll have to pay more for it soon , 
  at this point in history , a favorable deal for turkey would do more good to the world than a favorable deal for the uk . 
  and we thought 2015 was bad, 
   being pulled to the centre yes my bet also on a return of centrist politics . 
  i wonder how long do these cycles take ? 
  there was a time when these things happened without phone cameras and reddit posts . 
  people could actually forget . 
  apparently this is not photoshopped . 
  it is found [ here ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/12/abbas-erdogan-16-warriors-turkish-presidential-palace ) and it 's not april 1st . 
  he should bring back the [ varangians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/varangian_guard ), 
  even if greece wanted to , it would be violating eu laws by doing so right now . 
  nice . 
  you snap more than a 3 year old . 
  i was testing you, 
  then stop wasting other peoples time and read up https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gun_legislation_in_germany https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gun_politics_in_france,
