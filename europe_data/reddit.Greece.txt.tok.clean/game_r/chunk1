the point is : natural resources ** do not ** make you rich . 
  in fact , with very few exceptions , the countries that are net exporters of oil are by all means poor ones . 
  if you are a rich country you ca n't easily be an oil exporter because you have a higher energy demand than you can sell . 
  teslas and robotic cars have use , flying cars do n't ( at least yet ) . 
  tall buildings make better use of land area , increasing open green space . 
  take a look at athens that is full of 6 storey buildings , no green at all . 
  tall buildings also decrease transportation / commuting and infrastructure cost . 
  take a look at la where it can take you up to 2 hours to reach downtown from the suburbs . 
  should be renamed as putina vladimirovna . 
  i would n't mind tags if they were small and discrete . 
  usually they are gigantic atrocities . 
  they reached peak coal in the 1950s , so no they do n't . 
  solar panels on homes are most likely connected to the grid and sell the power to the energy companies . 
  so , it does n't make sense not to count them . 
  this label is the lamest thing i have ever seen . 
  norway 's purchasing power parity is 54k , while their nominal capita is around double that . 
  this means for every dollar earned in norway you can buy 50 cents worth of products . 
  this includes the bank bailouts etc , i am talking about the primary surplus greece has achieved . 
  the difference is that greece now does n't have deficits any more . 
  debt is growing , but it is only growing because of interest and not because of deficits . 
  this , coupled with the recession makes the debt huge , but sustainable . 
  byzantine empire holy roman empire it already has happened :d, 
  ancient macedonians were probably assimilated ( there are no macedonians today anywhere on the world ) , but even if the country wanting to be called macedonia had macedonian descent , that would n't change the history and magically make ancient macedonians , slavs . 
  as far as history is concerned ancient macedonians spoke ancient greek and shared the ancient greek culture . 
  it really is a petty thing and if the naming issue did n't exist , probably nationalism in greece would also be lower . 
  zimbabwe but only if they join the eurozone . 
  i do n't think turkey counts , because it is part european . 
  to be fair the map would be sworn by all the small states that existed before the first empires of europe emerged . 
  i have to agree . 
  also no matter how many taxes will be applied to snacks and drinks , they will continue to be a shitload cheaper than healthy food . 
  europe really has to think subsidizing healthy diet in some way . 
  but then california wo n't be the richest state any more , you will lose bragging rights . 
  that probably is true , but it still happened after the ice age and after the use of agriculture in mesopotamia . 
  you are forgetting the ice age which made the technology of agriculture impossible to be developed in europe before 10,000 bce . 
  mesopotamia was the most likely geographical place for agriculture to develop and it is n't surprising that it did happen there . 
  can confirm . 
  i was happy , then i looked at my bank account . 
  that is the price for every country in the eu or the eu customs union and any customs union for that matter . 
  when you enter a free trade area you ** not only ** have ** privileges ** but also ** responsibilities ** and ** limitations ** . 
  turkey might gain a profit by exporting agriculture products to russia right now , but self-conflicting economic policies will damage turkey 's ascension to the eu , which as a greek look really forward to for greater stability in the area . 
  i think it has to do with the fact that turkey has free trade with the eu . 
  why does it have an expiration date ? 
  why stop at full circle when putin can be crowned queen and empress of the universe ? 
  even in cold climate the neanderthals would n't survive with so much fur because of the unproductive sweat glands , but anyway hominids started to lose their fur before they migrated from africa ( dna tests in body hair lice and pubic lice suggests that ) . 
  neanderthals were much smarter than we once thought them to be , but still they were much dumber than homo sapiens because of their small childhood duration . 
  neanderthals certainly looked like ugly bighead humans , nothing close to an ape , they were really close cousins to us . 
  i find this on the verge of pseudoscience really . 
  the fur would limit the neanderthals ' ability to hunt , as they would overheat really fast . 
  one of the most common hunting techniques of early humans was to hunt animals to exhaustion and kill them while resting . 
  we can do it without a war lol, 
  hey we are trustworthy k ? 
  now giff us your ~ ~ taxeuros ~ ~ taxkronas \u3064 \u25d5 _ \u25d5 \u3064,

  although i did n't want the war with syria to happen i find it absurd how one diminished empire can talk shit to the usa and europe at the same time and get away with it . 
  i just ca n't . 
  we joined back in 1981 though , when europe was still playing it socialist lol, 
  it was , 50 years ago . 
  the new notes suck . 
  why ca n't we get canadian like notes ? 
  good luck with that . 
  payed transportation and lunch ? 
  this is not the 80s any more . 
  the last 2 decades none of this happened . 
  there are laughable jobs in the agriculture sector that people have to commute 70-80km for 30 euros a day ( working 10 hours ) and have to pay 18 euros for transportation . 
  then people go wondering why do n't our lazy youth come work at the fields . 
  lol ( it really happens ) . 
  i guess you ca n't beat competition when every fucking country neighboring to you by land is totally poor . 
  there are 700,000 public workers in greece , not in the millions . 
  the percentages are like most europe but we could indeed use less , so we should fire them for that reason and not just to fire somebody . 
  http://greece.greekreporter.com/2012/04/10/the-number-of-public-workers-in-greece-declines-says-census/ when arguing statistics that seem falsified search for facts first and not go quoting something journalists make up off their ass . 
  the fact that the greek economy contracted to an extent only possible by war makes people feel like second class citizens . 
  remember the question was not `` are you pro eu ? 
  '' , which 70 % of the greek people are but if you feel a european citizen . 
  i personally as a greek would love to feel a european citizen but the stupidity of our government and the ill-management of the crisis by our fellow europeans makes it feel really hard . 
  i mean we are on the 7th year of recession , most companies ( even the greek ones ) abandon us and go to neighboring eu countries like bulgaria all the time , it 's hard to live in this shithole even if you are not impacted by the crisis . 
  imagine it hard to breath outside in winter because people will burn what they can find to stay warm . 
  imagine half of your favorite shops closed and not having were to shop ( this is a real problem even if it sounds marie antoinette-like ) . 
  imagine rich people that lost everything in a matter of months and wander on the streets . 
  this is greece right now . 
  this is laughable .

  regarding gold : there 's a big enviromental debate in certain areas of greece that it would do tremendous damage to the enviroment . 
  generating 1000 jobs with a single gold mine would probably move 10,000 people out of job in the tourism industry as the nearby areas would n't be safe any more for tourist activities . 
  also there 's an economic dispute claiming that greece gets almost nothing out of that gold and that money goes only to the foreign companies that bought the land for pennies . 
  regarding oil : there 's the aegean dispute between greece and turkey regarding the percentage of the resources that belong to each country . 
  fair enough , greece has partnered with cyprus and israel in order to exploit those resources but still oil generating money is around half a decade away . 
  in my opinion balancing the service sector in greece in order to make it more exportable is the way to go for the future of my country . 
  the industrial sector is dead ( since the mid-90s ) and that wo n't change in the near future . 
  what about the boom of service sector which generates 70 % of the world 's gdp ? 
  you need well educated people ready for employment on that field . 
  i doubt russia can do that in the next few decades . 
  they probably like arma iii too much i guess ... 
  wow, 
   e.g. 
  95 % of the 1 % . 
  thanks for the clarification , it makes more sense now . 
  well people used to be like 1.60 m tall back then so it should of sufficed . 
  http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/08/0831_050831_chimp_genes.html sharing only 95 % of the dna makes you a different species . 
  maybe they mean 99.5 % or something ? 
   you try telling that to the people around here .
