  greece remembers . 
  the time will come when others will be in need . 
  i 'm honestly tired of greece being blamed for everything . 
  supporting a palestine state does n't mean hating israel though . 
  global warming \u2260 climate change global warming does not mean that every place on earth will get warmer . 
  in fact , some places could get colder and heatwaves and extreme cold could be more prevalent throughout the globe . 
  i think it was a really bad timing though , he should have posted it the day the plane was shot down . 
  the souvlaki got owned by the kebab . 
  fun fact : greece was probably the only country which was n't fucked by the bankers , but rather the banks got fucked by the country . 
  simply because most did n't pay enough money in their working life for the amount of social handouts they are currently receiving . 
  my parents are both pensioners ( 63 and 66 years old ) and they do help me way more than they should , but i understand that such a system can not continue to function . 
  3 million workers are currently paying the other 8 while the country has no sufficient production . 
  retired people are earning twice as much as a young working person , it 's nuts . 
  what if someone 's parents are dead , or they are simply in a bad relationship with them ? 
  if you want to help the youth , hand out unemployment benefits to them directly . 
  the argument that half of greece lives from pensioners ' money , therefore do n't cut the unsustainable pensions , is a silly argument . 
  this is just a publicity stunt . 
  2 weeks from now the greek parliament will vote a law which will restructure the social insurance and pension fund . 
  lots of pensioners are going to be raped , most rightfully so . 
  edit : i hope the downvoters realize that there are ** state pensioners ** that are ** netting 1500 euros ** a month in a bankrupt economy where the ** minimum wage is 486 fucking euros ** . 
  the gps signal takes a bit of time to update . 
  though i admit i do n't know if fighter planes use their acceleration data to correct their position . 
  actually the highest global economic growth was in the 1960s when the global population was increasing by 2.2 % yearly . 
  today the population growth is about half that ( 1.1 % ) . 
  one of the reasons for the stagnation of europe and japan is our shitty demographics . 
  i thought it was `` poly bridge '' in real life before i saw that too . 
  if greece ca n't , i do n't see why france should . 
  the coastline spatial resolution makes me uncomfortable . 
  just look at the goddamn peloponnese !, 
  / s tsipras seriously thinks he is mao . 
  well , he definitely needs some red guards to clean up his party . 
  the average gross salary in greece is about 1400-1500 euros ( 950-1 ,000 euros net ) . 
  i am pretty confident that their salaries can be halved without anyone deserting their jobs . 
  or maybe just drastically cut the salaries of the 17,000 deh ( greek power public company ) workers who earn an average gross monthly wage of 4,000 $ so people can fucking pay their power bill . 
  you read that right , 4,000 $ !, 
  also , reducing the bullshit taxes which are about 45-50 % of your consumption would definitely help . 
  multi-culturalism is certainly not something that was invented in the 20th and 21st centuries . 
  i 'm pretty sure we do n't call the country lifuania . 
  the point is that private schools were undertaxed up until now , and that particular tax exemption burdened other types of businesses . 
  the regulation is not meant as a punishment , but as a normalization . 
  i do n't understand why private education should be exempt from vat taxes , but that 's just me . 
  what greece needs is to aim for lower taxes for all businesses , not tax exemptions for some particular sectors . 
  edit : downvote all you want . 
  if private education is for profit , then it should follow the rules just like any other business out there . 
  1923-2015 rip, 
  well , empires tend to be multicultural so it was natural for it to happen only when the ottoman empire ceased to exist . 
  this is true , but greece only asked to relax austerity , not to abolish it . 
  there was no way the amount of fiscal adjustment could be done in that short timeframe without wrecking havoc in the country . 
  when samaras got scared of losing the next elections at the second half of 2014 and `` halted further austerity '' , the economy grew ( surprise ) . 
   big blow for all the countries that not received one and sucked the austerity up in 2010 . 
  this is laughable . 
  no eurozone country implemented the amount of austerity greece has had . 
  aside the obvious totalitarianism imposed from the ussr , the economic model was in fact pre-capitalist and not post-capitalist as it claimed to be . 
  ah , davutoglu the great matchmaker . 
  actually it is terrible . 
  the rich greeks will just move their property to their offshore company 's assets . 
  there is a huge greek immigrant community , many of which are for more than 20 years in a foreign country and are likely to own property there . 
  double-taxation is illegal . 
  it would violate certain treaties signed between greece and the other eu countries . 
  actually we did miss a substantial payment to the imf , which by any sane economist would be defined as a bankruptcy . 
  the imf and the eu decided to ignore it and say `` nah it 's not really a bankruptcy '' . 
  living in a country where priests are public sector employees , especially when a few days ago 178 priests got hired while there is a lack of teachers and doctors , it is hard for me not to be an angry atheist . 
  apes and other mammals have vastly more in-species phenotypic differentiations than humans , due to many tribes of humans getting filtered out in the early homo sapiens migration era . 
  http://phys.org/news/2007-05-theory-modern-humans-descended-small.html we share a common ancestor that lived 50,000 years ago with every human on the planet . 
  humans have very few genetic differences between them . 
  there is no way the majority of the population , no matter how malnourished would score a 59 . 
  if iq as a test actually meant shit , then people in the equatorial guinea would n't get a score lower than trained chimps . 
  this proves that the iq is more biased in testing knowledge than intelligence and problem solving . 
  a proper intelligence test would be one where you would n't get a better score if you trained for it . 
  i think this has a lot to do with immigrants putting more effort because of the need to succeed in society . 
  just like women the past few decades are more successful than men in university / college , because of a long history of less women studying in the western culture . 
  in a truly equal society , everyone would perform statistically about the same regardless of sex , race or other characteristics , because there would be no need to exceed a set of cultural expectations . 
  we will more than likely see the gap getting smaller within the next 50 years . 
  `` democracy '' should not be above human rights . 
  there are still very high tariffs in place for imported goods . 
  the nordic countries are gradually losing their competitiveness in the global market . 
  finland for example lost its competitiveness in mobile phones ( nokia ) and logging . 
  because trade is opening even more and they are small countries with really high salaries and taxes . 
  finland is doing bad at the moment for instance . 
  nordic countries have a high chance of a japan-like stagnation . 
  moving to bulgaria sounds tempting . 
   and like someone already pointed out here . 
  it is so ironic how the left is actually often pro-putin ( pro-russian ) here . 
  while right is anti-putin ( anti-russian ) , while actually sharing the same views . 
  europe is going through some serious schizophrenic stage when it comes to worldviews lately . 
  i was really glad to hear in the recent election debate the head of the communist party of greece saying `` russia is an imperialist country '' . 
  it took them 2 decades to wake up , but they woke up nonetheless . 
  baby steps i guess . 
  the weekly text post `` is greece safe to visit ? '', 
  in / r/greece by terrified potential tourists is getting rather annoying . 
  i mean ca n't they just google it ? 
  i think that turkey is the only country that is allowed to complain in this situation . 
  turkey really should n't have to bear the burden on her own . 
  the first one that comes to mind : http://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/02/tech/social-media/facebook-threat-carter/ the usa failing hard at their minority report . 
  first the nanny state came to the usa . 
  then it came to the uk . 
  is mainland europe next ? 
  that 's not enough to be considered wealthy . 
  they have no industry that takes these raw materials , processes them and sells products with added value in the international market . 
  instead , they sell these raw materials literally for pennies .
