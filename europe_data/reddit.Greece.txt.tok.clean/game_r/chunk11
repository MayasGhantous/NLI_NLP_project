  because of the low added value coefficient of the russian industry , russia is poorer than italy , even though it is the largest country in the world . 
  resources have nothing to do with a country 's wealth in the modern world , unless you just have too much like saudi arabia or norway . 
  what matters today is having a diversified economy with adequate private owned means of production operating in your country , something that russia clearly lacks . 
  it is a pan-european project , mostly or fully funded by the eu : http://www.citymobil2.eu/en/, 
  we usually use english terms for things that were not commonplace say 200 years ago , so everything that has to do with electronics or it is bound to use the english language . 
  this is not the official rule , but rather how everyday people are used to speak . 
  still , people use '' \u03c0\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03ba\u03b9 '' instead of mouse and '' \u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf '' instead of `` keyboard '' , but they use `` modem '' instead of '' \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03c9\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 '' and `` scanner '' instead of '' \u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 '' , because these terms sound too weird in greek .

  qe trickling down flawlessly ... 
  what a shameful display , an utter embarrassment of greece . 
  this looks more like making a kebab than removing it . 
  we live in the matrix confirmed . 
  sultan 's harem was n't , the janissaries were n't as well . 
  modern turks have predominantly indo-european characteristics ( slavic , albanian etc ) , which is to be expected as the ottoman empire stretched all the way to austria-hungary . 
  back then , what really distinguished turks from non-turks was religion . 
  nationalism is a fairly modern concept . 
  the ottoman empire was a multicultural empire , just like all empires . 
  this is the reason why genocides happened in the first place . 
  they were n't turkish , they were ottoman . 
  the 1910s were a bad time for empires . 
  honestly , i am a proponent of the eu having a single timezone . 
  the horizontal width of the eu is only about 1/14th to 1/15th of the globe , compared to 1/24th of a timezone , so it could work out . 
  to be honest if a nuclear war set us back technologically to the 1980s we might as well kill ourselves . 
  byzantium was established in 657bce by colonists from megara . 
  this is were the name actually comes from , as eastern romans never called them selves byzantines , but `` romioi '' ( romans ) . 
  not necessarily a bot army , might just be an angry mob of nationalists . 
  actually it is much easier to do it in europe than most of the world as we already have crazy high taxes . 
  we only need to readjust the funding . 
  most european countries already have an aging population so reforming the pension funds to ubi funds is n't going to be that hard . 
  for instance , the greek pension system costs about 30b $ a year , that 's enough money to give 270 $ to every adult without increasing taxes by a single cent . 
  that 's on parity with the unemployment benefit . 
   according to abc of economics humans consumption needs are endless how much free food can you eat in one sitting ? 
  how many free drinks can you drink in one sitting ? 
  that is the core of the spirit of the eu , that smaller countries have as much leverage as the large ones . 
  this was what we were promised when we joined the eu in 1981 . 
  do n't be such a spoiled brat trudeau . 
  stop being the global safe-heaven shithole for oil and mining and then we 'll talk . 
  hurr durr kebab ataturk signed the lasagna treaty . 
  hurr durr baklava is bitter . 
  apart from economic policy , i pretty much agree with syriza in almost every matter . 
  i agree that religious dogmas have no place in class , but politics of religion are a very important part of history class . 
  byzantine iconoclasm , islam and the crusades , protestantism , the 30 years war etc shaped europe throughout the centuries . 
   `` in the name of the holy and consubstantial and indivisible trinity ''  the constitution of greece , page 13 http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/userfiles/f3c70a23-7696-49db-9148-f24dce6a27c8/001-156%20aggliko.pdf greece is not a secular country , it is a country with an official religion , with priests recognized as civil servants and an autonomous monastic state that is unaccessible by women and administrated by the orthodox church . 
  the rest of religions have to be recognized by the orthodox church as well in order to gain official status . 
  i agree , i just expect some respect from our neighbors . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw0z5b01kqa papandreou was not so paranoid after all . 
  reference : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/istanbul_pogrom, 
   the turks actually did not force islam on the people . 
  they did force their way of life though . 
  women were supposed to dress modestly and wear the veil even if they were christian . 
  well , they did n't really gtfo , they fought in the greek war of independence and became greeks . 
  the most renown fighters in that war were native albanian speakers . 
  to be fair , becoming muslim during the ottoman empire was probably the wisest choice . 
  it 's not really about food and accommodation , rather than water / sewage / waste disposal . 
  non touristy islands lack proper infrastructure to accommodate for anyone more than the citizens , that 's why they are a horrible candidate . 
   i 'm curious though . 
  i 'm assuming you are greek . 
  given your country and people history - you just accept such large number of muslims in your country ? 
  no tensions ? 
  you do n't consider them an existential threat ? 
  because they are gon na demand for you to appease their muslim customs at some point and afaik your people had that `` pleasure '' for a long time . 
  many brutal wars to be free from it and now you just accepting their presence ? 
  we already have a properly integrated muslim minority in western thrace . 
  no , i do n't consider them an existential threat . 
  what i do consider an existential threat is people willing to give muslim immigrants preferential treatment in the eyes of the law and that happens all over europe . 
  this is the core of the problem and not immigration itself , at least to my opinion . 
  if we stop being soft , then they will have to integrate . 
   because your islands are perfect for this . 
  unless the eu literally hands out billions of euros for infrastructure , no the islands are not perfect or ready . 
  the thing is that the european right wing stands to the left of the american left wing . 
  if you compare it to a 1930s gulag , sure . 
  is that how low our standards have fallen ?

  the real question is , why does n't your apartment already have a decent heater ? 
  is n't it required by law ? 
  the same shit happens in american and british prisons though , where they make prisoners work for mere cents / hour . 
  so bbc better get off their high horse on that one . 
  edit : downvote me all you want . 
  penal labor is alive and well in the us :  `` neither slavery nor involuntary servitude , ** except as a punishment for crime ** whereof the party shall have been duly convicted , shall exist within the united states , or any place subject to their jurisdiction . '', 
  formally abolishing slavery in the united states , the 13th amendment was passed by the congress on january 31 , 1865 , and ratified by the states on december 6 , 1865 . 
  the claim that rome ever had over 1m people in antiquity is doubtful . 
  the devaluation of nok and cdn might have caused a boost to the other sectors of the economy . 
  merkel ally says nein . 
  apartments of 50-60m ^ 2 are the most bang for your buck in greece . 
  smaller apartments ( 25-30m ^ 2 ) are more rare and higher priced ( $ / m ^ 2 ) . 
  this is due to greece having a housing surplus and about 200k apartment vacancies . 
  300 euros get you a decent apartment . 
  the only subscription model that resembled cable was `` nova '' , a bundle of satellite tv channels that launched in 1999 . 
  very few people had it and piracy was super common ( sharing the channels to the whole apartment block while paying only one subscription ) . 
  nato mainly exists to project us power across the globe . 
  defunding it would weaken the us more than it would weaken europe . 
  considering the us has been pushing and failing for an eu-us trade deal since the nafta days , this is hardly surprising . 
  as long as the demands of the us remain constantly absurd , no european politician will risk ruining their political career / legacy by signing such a trade deal . 
  far right = nationalist socialists far left = globalist socialists, 
   they were n't working for free , they were paid by their government . 
  they were paid less than half the minimum wage , their work might as well be considered free . 
  they probably considered cyprus too small compared the other colonies to raise funds for a railway . 
  if we get nato nukes with a far left government it is going to be fucking hilarious . 
  pasok / syriza have a long history of calling for the dissolution of nato , not just for a nato grexit . 
  we are for a decade or so , though with very small teams and limited funding .
