  and here we are ... 
  i think it is more likely to die from an islamist attack in paris than in the tourist areas of turkey . 
  there have n't been any riots , because they can leave turkey any time . 
  if they come to greece they are stuck here , because they can not legally move to other eu countries ( dublin ii regulation ) . 
  they ca n't enter our watebs !, 
  sounds like ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aegean_dispute, 
  they did target everyone who opposed communism . 
  non-communists might not have been exactly a race or ethnic minority , but you could still describe it as genocide . 
  genocide during peacetime is probably worse . 
  i mean when a 17n member had broken out of prison , the us embassy went nuts , demanding his immediate prosecution and `` softly threatened '' the greek government . 
  who knows , maybe it was all a ploy !, 
   that the marxist terrorist organisation 17n was actually controlled by pasok / the communist party/the secret service / ** the americans ** . 
  but 17n killed cia agents in greece , it does n't make sense . 
   the only big and widely accepted conspiracy theory is that the whole world is conspiring against turkey . 
  sounds exactly like greece . 
  it is far easier to gross 20k euros as a 1-person business in austria than in greece though . 
  it 's not about having balls or not . 
  until the eu recognizes crimea as russian territory , no one should accept these passports . 
  to be fair , i do n't really care . 
  to be fair , it 's not like they would n't have to pay for the products , so the poor would still remain poor . 
  the left platform has majority in the central committee of syriza , but are a minority in the parliament . 
  normally the committee has higher power than the pm , but tsipras claims that the people that voted syriza , voted the pro-eu syriza and not the left platform . 
  he is implying that the left platform hid their ulterior motive behind a pro-eu party and deceived the people . 
  he is proposing many things , including a public ballot vote where people will decide the future of syriza . 
  if you ask me it is another example of the design flaws of syriza and their hunger for power without any preparation . 
  they are getting self-destructed . 
  the question is not the chance of syriza dissolving , that 's granted . 
  the question is what is the probability of the left platform taking over the party , leading tsipras into making a new party . 
  just do n't get bankrupt and make us send esm money to you in the future / s, 
  thank you based bulgaria for not making fun of us . 
  cyprus is n't greek territory . 
  i do n't see how the situations are comparable . 
  our politicians are really good at being bad , so i guess you are right !, 
  most are conscripts , with an 8 euro , ** yes 8 euro ** monthly wage . 
  obviously yes . 
  even if we have a war , can you even transport and fit 100k soldiers in an island like imia ? 
  i do n't think so ... 
  but the politicians have convinced us that we need even more soldiers because `` turkey '' . 
  meanwhile estonia has 6k soldiers with all the tensions with russia . 
  selling the railway for 0 euro would be a success , it has insanely high upkeep costs . 
  you know one hectar in far eastern russia probably costs like half a square meter in manhattan . 
  only one hectare ? 
  i mean they could give a hundred and still have plenty left . 
  biggest fucking country in the world or sth ... 
  they can do what many farmers have done in greece , circumvent traditional retailers and sell the products to the consumers on their own , by establishing a cooperative retail chain . 
  one great example is this : http://www.thesgala.gr/en.html, 
  insurance ( medical and pension ) in greece is about 43 % of your gross salary . 
  they do it because it is worth the risk of getting caught and fined . 
  if it is more dangerous to risk to come to europe than to stay even temporarily in their own country , i do n't see how they could be defined as asylum seekers . 
  if bombs are falling all over you , you flee immediately , you do n't wait . 
  how to identify if they are fake refugees : are there about half as many women in the group ? 
  they are real refugees . 
  are there few to none women in the group ? 
  they are fake refugees . 
  how can bosnia have more unemployment than kosovo ? 
  so an equivalent of just about 270km of brand new autobahn ? 
  i do n't see how this is the biggest modernization campaign for germany . 
  honestly , i pretty much think that we have reached the point that we do n't care any more about the damn metopes . 
  just do n't bleach them any further , k ? 
  i 'm pretty sure in malia the hotels / bars are not those who are complaining but the old poor citizens that do n't make money of tourism . 
  we have to make them understand that their way of life is not acceptable here and they have to respect the people giving them aid . 
   what is the solution ? 
  fortress europe ? 
  the only solution is to help their countries with proper humanitarian aid and find a way to stop the wars in the middle east , it will be cheaper in the long run . 
  we also have to invest in northern africa and the middle east to further stabilize the area . 
  the prices did correct themselves a few years later . 
  when oil became much more expensive , prices did n't increase as much as they normally would . 
  consumption did n't fall , but that 's because due to the price hikes creating an elite retail middle class with disposable income . 
  if you had a cafeteria or a restaurant you would see your net earnings double or even triple . 
  they would use this money to buy more luxury goods , build a second house etc. 
  this map is so wrong i would trust anecdotal evidence any day . 
  it 's not our fault the one who made the map was smoking something ... 
  the biggest fast food chain is goodys anyway . 
  they invented biological warfare without knowing . 
  there is a 75.8 % home ownership , but that includes a high amount of mortgages ( usually the same price as rent ) or even having an old-ass house in a village while you work and live in the city where you need to rent . 
  also , being more productive when working less does n't mean you work smarter or harder . 
  it just means more capital investments and thus technological innovations have happened in your country allowing you to produce more by working less . 
  rent in greece costs at least 200 euros a month though for a shitty flat . 
  you need 250-300 euros for something decent . 
  you can use e-banking and credit / debit cards without any limit as long as the money is kept within greece . 
  if the greek debt got erased it would still be at least 10 years until greece could loan with low interest rates . 
  we stopped buying german products in greece for a while , not because of boycotting but because we run out of moneys . 
  it 's because it ca n't compete with our awesome greek fast food . 
  it did bad before the crisis , but since the crisis started stores started closing . 
  if you walked past a greek mcdonald 's you would only notice chinese tourists eating there . 
  mcdonald 's is crap , but burger king is awesome . 
  bk is planning to open stores in greece . 
  it 's hard to make a greek big mac index as mcdonalds failed here . 
  there are less than 10 mcdonalds stores in the whole country !, 
  how about a souvlaki / gyros index instead ? 
  greek communists being furious is no sign at all . 
  they are always furious and they will always say no to everything . 
  giscard hates us now http://www.ekathimerini.com/199059/article/ekathimerini/news/suspend-greece-from-euro-says-former-french-president-giscard-destaing i just hope he is just getting old and retarded and does n't mean it . 
  parliaments are people now . 
  so , nuclear family flag ? 
  do yet another referendum !, 
  and then his party did nothing to oppose the nomenklatura , instead they embraced it . 
   but he 's absolutely right that greece would be in more trouble now without the eu than it would be with it . 
  how so ? 
  if greece never joined the eu , cheap credit would n't be available and thus we would n't be in the clusterfuck of a default .
