  that does not mean that refugees should be given jobs and freedom of movement . 
  refugees should stay in enclosed refugee camps where they are given shelter , food , medical care and education for the children . 
  nothing more , nothing less . 
  definitely a conspiracy of right-wing orthodox goat-priests to suppress the labor day . 
  greece tries to unlock aid , unlocks aids instead . 
  what i mean is that even if there will be a new bailout , it will solely be because we did n't fit the criteria to get the money from the previous bailout . 
  the money the ez countries will be called to pay will be more or less the same amount they would have to pay , had the greek government managed to fit the criteria 9 months ago . 
  greece wo n't take any `` new money '' . 
  the deal was already signed last summer , yet greece has received only a very small portion of the loans . 
  the fact is that syriza has been stalling and failing to meet the requirements to receive the new loans . 
  this has gotten to the point that the previous deal needs to be scrapped and a new one to take its place . 
  it 's hardly a new bailout deal . 
  is n't the purpose of black roofs to absorb as much heat from sunlight as possible ? 
  i do n't know if it makes sense , but the past 7 years feel like decades of political events , yet at the same time it feels as if the crisis started yesterday . 
  the big recession might be over , yet stagflation seems to have kicked in . 
   boaty mcboatface ` unlikely ' to be name of britain 's new polar research vessel despite runaway win of public vote . 
   http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/17/boaty-mcboatface-the-runaway-winner-of-ship-naming-public-vote/ :(, 
  when will public figures finally learn about the streisand effect ? 
  at this point it should be taught on pr 101 . 
  the bigmac index is not really useful for greece . 
  there are less than 10 mcdonald 's restaurants in the whole country that mostly foreign tourists visit . 
  this probably inflates the price of the bigmac . 
  you can buy about 1.3-1 .4 pita-gyros on the minimum wage if that 's helpful . 
  canadians are assholes with a polite face . 
  they 'll screw you over and then just say they are sorry . 
  some of the most fucked up multinationals , like mining companies that pollute countries in the third world , have their headquarters in canada and face no prosecution in canadian soil . 
  there are various reasons to be concerned about free trade between the eu and nafta trade zones , and aside safety regulation , freedom of movement should be a given right if such a deal ever passes . 
  you fail to meet romania 's criteria for a free trade agreement . 
  that 's your problem , not theirs . 
   however i 'm not in favour of dropping these visa restrictions until romania ( and the other five countries of whom we require visas ) satisfy our visa exemption criteria ( mostly regarding the proportion of people who overstay their visas ) . 
   you ca n't have free trade and flow of capital while restricting freedom of movement . 
  demanding that is absurd . 
   he was a jewish collaborator against his own people in budapest during iiww was n't he like 9 years old back then ? 
   and locals are screwed with all those immigrants on their fields since they should be plowing now . 
  this is what makes very little sense . 
  the immigrants are not on public property , but they are loitering private property and no one from the police seems to care . 
  i hope the locals sue the greek police to oblivion and get a substantial sum for reparations . 
   that said , refugee crisis offset it a bit last year and likely will continue to offset it this year . 
  last year was actually a record high year . 
  probably only a couple of islands were affected . 
  and that 's without counting unpaid overtime . 
  you either work more hours for free or get fired . 
  it is more of a structural issue and lack of big corporations in greece . 
  small businesses need to employ as few people as possible and operate as many hours a day as possible . 
  a ) it 's high time that changed b ) is n't it retarded celebrating on a non-accurate date because of convenience / religious customs ? 
  still , i would propose february 3rd though , because that is the date that really matters . 
  the same reason i also have an issue with the first line of our constitution being `` in the name of the holy and consubstantial and indivisible trinity '' . 
  actually it was britain , france and russia , with britain being the most deciding factor as they actually loaned us money . 
  fun trivia : we managed to pay off that loan a few years ago , so greece can into pay debts . 
  also , the revolution started a few days before , so the day is completely fake . 
  greek revolution day you say ? 
  more like immaculate conception of yeezus day !, 
  i just want people to get it right for once . 
  happy greek revolution day would be much more accurate . 
  no it 's not . 
  the greek independence day is february 3rd ( 1830 ) . 
  today is the start of the revolution ( 25th march 1821 ) . 
  the greek state overlooks the independence day and has chosen the start of the war as a national holiday instead . 
  the greek independence day ** is not ** a national holiday . 
  nanny state for rebellious adults . 
  jewish is an ethnicity judaism is a religion, 
  / r/nottheonion earth hour is stupid anyway . 
  the candles and lanterns people light release more co2 than leds . 
   you get ** razed ** with quranic verses pun intended ? 
  no side is happy . 
  this is a good deal then . 
  exactly this . 
  when every country starts committing unilateral actions , the fact that the eu still exists as a bureaucratic hell hole does n't mean much . 
  yes , it 's the same word translated . 
   with ~ ~ gyro ~ ~ doner !, 
  and rak\u0131 !, 
  hey , do n't steal our word !, 
   so basically they made people with over $ 100k hold almost a bond in the bank which would only be paid pack if the bank did well . 
  greece did n't want to be this radical . 
  first of all , something like 95 % of the savings / checkings accounts in greece are under 100k . 
  the haircut would be done to a very small amount of money . 
  most importantly , even if you nullified all accounts in the banks , you would n't get a single cent . 
  why ? 
  because greek banks have borrowed 50 % of the greek gdp from the ela ( emergency liquidity assistance ) a whopping 100bn $ . 
  it would n't make a difference . 
  the south is literally greece , rofl . 
  is this polandball inspired ? 
   those are insignificant islands that gives huge amounts of territory , ** it 's understandable that we want them . 
  ** so , this is the reason i have to be conscripted in the army and lose 9 months of my life right ? 
  well , seriously fuck you turkey . 
  how about no ? 
  do you realize that in order to house those refugees in greece you need something like 30bn $ a year , not 3bn $ . 
  3bn $ is n't even enough to cover the cost for turkey . 
  well what did you expect from an ultranationalist far-right party ? 
  even some left-leaning mps might have had been offended by that , though they definitely would n't have thrown out the journalists . 
   people 's lives started to actually improve during the khrushchev and brezhnev times . 
  which was when people born between 1930 and 1945 were becoming adults . 
  i think the people that were born between 1930 and 1945 had their standard of living go up really fast and still were in favor of communism even in its late days . 
  it was the later generations that experienced relative stagnation . 
  then she went to the local church to light some candles . 
  2016 : send immigrants back to turkey 2017 : retake constantinople 2018 : ... 2019 : ~ ~ profit ~ ~ pay debts 2020 : profit, 
  how is my statement irrational ? 
  nowadays , trade is more free than it was before , but it is miles away from being considered what liberals define as `` free trade '' . 
  your analogy does n't make sense by the way . 
  technically turkey did n't exist back then , it was the last days of the ottoman empire .
