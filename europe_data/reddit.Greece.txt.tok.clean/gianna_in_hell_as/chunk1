i had heard a lot about this documentary when it came out . 
  i would really like to find it somewhere . 
  my picks would be [ dogtooth ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1379182/combined ) ( 2009 ) which completely blew me away and for something more greek and easier to watch , [ rembetiko ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086182/combined ) ( 1983 ), 
  great , you got a lot of nice recommendations for chania !, 
  it 's a beautiful town . 
  herakleion city is not that nice itself but there are some cool places to visit around . 
  it was built by bavarians so the old town has a bit of a northern european feel and very good city planning . 
  it 's impossible to get lost in sparta . 
  crete is pretty big . 
  in which area are you going ? 
  not so sure about marine life but milos has some gorgeous sea caves and very interesting rock formations . 
  the boyfriend like snorkeling and he loved it in milos . 
  go to nisyros and [ walk in the caldera of a volcano ] ( http://mw2.google.com/mw-panoramio/photos/medium/11632141.jpg ) visit [ sarakiniko beach in milos ] ( http://www.touristorama.com/assets/images/articles_en/sarakiniko-beach-milos/sarakiniko-beach-milos.jpg ) go to [ simos beach in elafonissos ] ( http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/travel/pix/pictures/2013/3/21/1363879666413/simos-beach-on-elafonisso-001.jpg ) go to [ paxoi and antipaxoi ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/12884966.jpg ) swim in [ canal d'amour in corfu ] ( http://www.atlasvisual.com/sites/default/files/photogalleries/canal_d_amour_sidari_corfu_01.jpg ) swim in a waterfall in [ samothraki ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tdcy-vbgjlc/tlnk1v5ftci/aaaaaaaaeye/z-e3panbohi/s1600/1_69.jpg ) or [ ikaria ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bs-anp35wye/ub6mzmm9lei/aaaaaaaacdc/9jmpulwfpjo/s1600/samothraki600_001_79423_3c2455.jpg ), 
  it is not a shithole . 
  but it is boring . 
  go to milos for snorkelling , it has the most gorgeous beaches in all of greece . 
  nearby kimolos is also lovely for a quick visit and i had some pretty yummy seafood there . 
  fluently , 3 . 
  greek , english and french . 
  i can also communicate fairly decently in norwegian , spanish and german . 
  [ he smiles a lot ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-a_m-euvu5fg/t6u6cey02ui/aaaaaaaad4a/_spbzgphekq/s320/samaras.jpg ), 
  that is a very nice picture of merkel . 
  she looks so sweet and kind !, 
  hot ? 
  have your seen their lesbian ? 
  our turnout was 58,22 % , higher than 2009 . 
  i am not surprised , people wanted to send a message with their vote . 
  will be going to vote later today . 
  not sure what i want to vote for yet just know that i do n't want golden downs or syriza to be very high so will vote for something else . 
  i guess bulgaria would have to send aziz and we 'll see . 
  public voting is a travesty with countries only voting for their neighbours and stupid immigrant voting . 
  i totally prefer this system , at least the quality of the song matters . 
  it sucks so bad . 
  i voted for you guys . 
  it was a very fun song and my son absolutely loves it . 
  but considering he 's a toddler perhaps that 's not a good thing ? 
  i speak french so i get the lyrics too , very funny . 
  i voted for conchita cause i loved the song and her voice . 
  her win was more than about sending a message , she sang beautifully . 
  as for the twins , they were just propaganda tools and even that failed . 
  insane homophobes have no place in a civilised europe and russia reaped with it sowed with the booing . 
  i read that they are voting as ukraine whether they want to or not . 
  it 's raining like a mothertrucker today . 
  how about beach ? 
  ( paralias ), 
  greek : grandparents . 
  furthermore , the words for grandmother and grandfather are ridiculously childish ( yaya and papous ) and there are no proper , non childish words for them in modern greek . 
  privacy . 
  there are some neologisms that cover it now but it 's mostly untranslatable . 
  stalker . 
  there have been translations calling it something like `` hunter '' but it does n't really work and in general most computing terms . 
  for some there are translations but i have not found a proper translation for mouse pad or touchpad that is not utterly ridiculous, 
  i used to eat langos when i lived in vienna ( round 13-14 years old ) . 
  thought it was super delicious but thought it must be an african food because the capital of nigeria is lagos . 
  i was not a smart kid ... 
  man , where do i start ? 
  everything is wrong . 
  corruption , tax evasion , crippling bureaucracy , insane government , nazis , moronic leftist terrorists , social welfare in shambles , suicides , debt ... so much debt !, 
  huge unemployment and no sense that we have a future . 
  greeks are also a very pessimistic people . 
  i think that we dont really have it that bad but it is hard to see it . 
  to me it tasted a bit like a cross between salmon and veal . 
  was n't overly fond of it but it was a cold cut . 
  i want to try a steak at some point . 
  ( in norway , not greece or anywhere else ), 
  yep , can confirm . 
  i have said it . 
  while meeting my boyfriend 's parents for the first time which might have not been the best timing . 
  but i was just mad at how they mistreat their kids , i do n't actually want them all dead . 
  so did the one who was taking care of my grandmother . 
  called herself bulgarian but looked totally roma . 
  i hope things are better for you but our lady left in the middle of the night after convincing my gullible grandfather to give her an advance on next month 's pay . 
  she also fudged all of her accounts to him and stole a significant amount of money and stuff from the house . 
  you should see my electricity bill . 
  i pay for everything but electricity in it . 
  it 's something like 50 eur for my electricity ( it 's a home that i do n't even use now ) and 60 eur for council tax and another 880 eur a year just for owning a house . 
  they do n't care whether i can afford to pay or the fact that i am making no money off that house , i got ta pay that property tax . 
  it 's insanity . 
  i live in northern athens and my vet told me i really must vaccinate my indoor-outdoor cat as there have been cases of rabies in foxes that live in the nearby mountain . 
  sucks cause greece was a rabies free country until very recently . 
  i do n't think i have heard a single joke about albanians in the last decade or so . 
  in the early and mid 90s they were very popular , though . 
  of course it would . 
  and i would still forget to include it ... 
  sucked at all the former easter bloc countries . 
  i 'm old , never learnt them in school . 
  love how the test also tells you which country you picked by mistake . 
   only those in the european part are included . 
  aha , in that case i submit we should only count the european part of istanbul . 
  how do i forget munich !? 
  shame on me . 
  lost a few on spelling . 
  beograd should have worked for belgrade , not fair . 
  all i know about spain i learned from pedro almodovar movies . 
  you guys are weird . 
  if you will be going from greece to italy or vice versa by ferry at any point , the ionian islands are also an option . 
  corfu is totally gorgeous and from there you can get a ferry to brindisi in italy or to venice . 
  if you want another island , paxoi is close to corfu and also worth a visit . 
  there are some gorgeous beaches there . 
  by the way , it 's not exactly in the spirit of a backpacking holiday but do not completely exclude air travel .
