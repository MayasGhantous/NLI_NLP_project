  i can barely make ends meet , since 2011 my income has been slashed in half and keeps shrinking . 
  i voted yes to this moronic referendum because i did n't want to give tsipras my vote of confidence because i do n't believe him one bit . 
  he 's a demagogue and he 's leading greece straight to destruction . 
  you want some more no voters ? 
  my cousin who votes golden dawn . 
  this person i know who has been claiming to be destitute yet she gets undeclared income from abroad . 
  she loves all the scholarship money and all the support she gets from the state and the eu for her kid and all of that but clearly hates to give anything back . 
  not to mention that she 's going to leave the country forever and move to the us in a few months . 
  oh , i 'm sure she 'll love being a leftist in the us , fun times . 
  another girl , when i asked her why she 's voting no she told me it 's because she 's mad as hell that the europeans want all our natural resources . 
  i asked her what natural resources , where does it say that in the agreement and she told me she has n't read it , a friend of hers told her all about it . 
  if you truly think that most of the no voters are a homogeneous group of righteous and brave individuals you are deluded . 
  sometimes loving but also hating this place is a sentiment most greeks can agree on . 
  one way or another we 'll build something again . 
  i do n't like tsipras and his government , i do find them grossly incompetent and i believe that this stupid referendum should have never happened but on the other hand they are right about a lot of things . 
  when someone owes you money it makes little sense to break his legs and expect him to then work to pay you off . 
  how would that go ? 
  we need to breathe , we need hope . 
  no , no , no , he seems like a rational kid , do n't take him away from us too . 
  varoufakis had said clearly that he would resign if yes won . 
  tsipras had alluded at himself not being an `` all-weather prime minister '', 
  oh , yeah , never a dull moment here . 
  i 'm personally waiting for the moment the first ious make their appearance . 
  maybe some people will start to understand where it 's all headed . 
  ahaha , i do n't approve of that , actually . 
  i just really liked the cypriot song this year . 
  truly wish they wont give our song 12 points , it 's total crap, 
  romania got through, 
  yay for cyprus !!!, 
  so happy !, 
  i do n't think we ever really had golden days . 
  just a handful of songs here and there that did n't suck . 
  last being alcohol is free only 2 years ago which was good and did pretty well . 
  i will say that even though this year 's song is crappy that woman has a fantastic voice, 
  was n't going to but i liked romania so ended up sending a message for them, 
  very ashamed that once again we made it to the final with a shit song . 
  it was awful . 
  halfway through my boyfriend asked if she was singing in english estonia is excellent and i also liked romania . 
  i had n't heard it before . 
  most turks i 've met were really cool . 
  your government , not so much . 
  i just do n't get it , does everyone else in the eu have a whole lot of tuberculosis ? 
  maybe the rest of the quote was `` greeks are the best at being lazy '', 
  wait , so you think we are the best ( sharing the crown with danes and italians ) and we think you should be bombed every 50 years ? 
  sure , i hired singular logic to do it :p ... not really , i explain my crappy methodology here : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4hu3v1/map_of_greek_questionsstatements_about_europe/d2sayga you can check results too but make sure you are in an incognito tab or on a browser you do n't use . 
  dood , it 's greeks . 
  how would we see portugal as poor ? 
  we 're ready to hit you up for a loan . 
  dunno , it leads to a an article from march 22nd that says you closed your borders with that country that does n't exist . 
  the fact that no other of those so called belgians have showed up is starting to worry me . 
  i guess it 's this high up because a lot of people would google it to try to find out whether churchill ever said that . 
  i hope ... 
  here is some background on the statement ( source in english ) http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/11/25/some-greeks-turn-to-elder-paisios-prophecies-on-russia-turkey-conflict/ it 's based on a prophecy by elder paisios !, 
  killmenow, 
  you guys are weird . 
  in this case it 's a statement , not a question . 
  most of them are statements , actually . 
  cyprus too . 
  beta is pronounced softly in greek , like an english v . we do n't have a letter for the `` b '' sound so we make it with m and p ( \u03bc\u03c0 ), 
  it would be strange . 
  i followed links and i get this : http://www.castellano.gr/?p=81 so it really is about learning spanish . 
  yeah , it made little sense to me either . 
  the second most popular one was `` under franco '' the `` spanish alphabet '' thing leads to online resources for learning spanish . 
  wait , you do n't ? 
  crap !, 
  cancels plan to go be unemployed in switzerland, 
  aha , found it . 
  i was wrong , it is actually a book written in 1982 so would n't be very current : http://www.eleftheriskepsis.gr/product_info.php?products_id=45810, 
  wait !, 
  it was in the greek news that sweden is so efficient at processing garbage to get energy that it now needs to import it . 
  article here : http://www.naftemporiki.gr/story/853075/i-souidia-eisagei-skoupidia we do n't mean anything else by it !, 
  honest !, 
  bing ??? 
  of course not !, 
  google on internet explorer !, 
  hehe , i see the full title now , i think it 's an article titled `` poland and us : findings and prospects '' . 
  it probably refers to doing business with poland . 
  oh , thank dog it was churchill !, 
  i knew someone had said it but for some reason i thought it was pagkalos !!!, 
  * is an idiot * editted to add : did my research . 
  it must be a fake quote . 
  see ellinikahoaxes ( the greek snopes ) about it : http://ellinikahoaxes.gr/2015/02/17/%ce%ba%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%b1%cf%81%cf%81%ce%af%cf%80%cf%84%ce%b5%cf%84%ce%b1%ce%b9-%ce%bf%cf%85%ce%af%ce%bd%cf%83%cf%84%ce%bf%ce%bd-%cf%84%cf%83%cf%8e%cf%81%cf%84%cf%83%ce%b9%ce%bb-%ce%b7-%ce%b3%ce%b5/, 
  i do n't know !, 
  that 's what it said . 
  are you sure you exist ? 
  my scientific process was to open ie which i never use and then proceed to type country names in the definite form ( \u0397 \u0393\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03b1 , \u0397 \u0393\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 , \u03a4\u03bf \u0392\u03ad\u03bb\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf etc ) and waited for autocomplete to fill in the statement or question . 
  my skills are abysmal and this was done on paint so hopefully you can read it . 
  sorry germany :*( oh noes , just realised i forgot montenegro !, 
  my only result was princess4 * which is apparently a hotel . 
  no , no one that i saw celebrated very publicly in the sense of dancing in the street , or something like that . 
  re : the university , this is my main account so i do n't want it associated with too much identifying info , sorry . 
  just because no one you knew did it , do you really believe it did n't happen ? 
  get out of your bubble . 
  i saw it happen and i saw people cheer . 
  i hate to break it to you but i was in university at the time . 
  i was in a university residence watching it unfold and a bunch of leftist students were clapping and cheering when the towers fell . 
  it was horrific . 
  this video of a cat hugging like a human : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpyha7hecgi i think it 's russian . 
  not just allow , we 're pretty much begging them to move to shelters . 
  and locals are screwed with all those immigrants on their fields since they should be plowing now .
