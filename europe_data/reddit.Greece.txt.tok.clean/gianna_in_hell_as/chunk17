  the moment it was reported to them that there were sellers there illegally they should have done something about it . 
  legal merchants are turning to the golden dawn because they are getting screwed over , constantly , cause the police is not doing its job . 
  the people who had stands there legally are not rich and they do n't deserve to be paying while others just set up a stand and sell with bigger profits . 
  of course a bunch of fuckheads like the golden dawn do n't have the right to take the law into their own hands . 
  and the police should arrest them , they are doing everything publicly ffs ( though germenis - the bald guy who speaks in the video - has immunity as an mp so not sure what they can do there ) . 
  i do n't know ... the police just sucks either way , due to incompetence and due to their affiliation with g.d. and people are just getting screwed over left and right . 
  the bald guy also said that they went to the police about it first and then they did what golden dawn does ( presumably after the police did nothing ) . 
  they are not justified , of course but the people there were largely on their side , despite their methods . 
  : / also , germenis said in his interview to themos anastasiadis that despite his black metal background he is a christian orthodox . 
  really proved it there ... destroying that guy 's stuff was so christian . 
  i 'm just glad nobody was injured . 
  well , it 's not like they will come and break your legs if you do n't pay back the blood but it 's a honour system and it 's working so far . 
  the guy i donated for had already donated twice in a month for his mother , poor thing . 
  and she was terminal too :( our secretary at work told us and me and some of my coworkers got together to go and get him out of debt so he wouldnt ' worry about that crap too . 
  in greece you get an orange juice and some crackers or a small cake . 
  we have a shortage far as i know so we have a system where if someone needs a blood transfusion they get it but then they `` owe '' the blood and a friend or relative needs to go donate . 
  both cases i donated were like that , once for my mother and another time i donated for the mother of this guy i did n't even know but i felt really sorry for him cause he owed something like 10 bottles . 
  army conscripts can get leave if they donate . 
  i do n't think it should be paid but i like the latvian incentive system . 
  i feel good about donating esp . 
  cause i have negative rhesus blood and fairly rare but my low iron very rarely allows it . 
  curious about something , are you allowed to donate if you have a fairly recent tattoo ? 
  it 's not allowed here even a few years after . 
  no worries , i 've been called way worse things than french . 
  it looks like i will have to go to portugal for that ... would you believe that in a city of 5 million ( athens ) there is n't a single portuguese restaurant ? 
  this sucks !, 
  i 've eaten brazilian a couple of times and it was awesome , not sure how similar it is . 
  greece here . 
  last things i purchased with 20 eur : roughly 11 litres of petrol . 
  a blood test and a urine test at a private lab because i did n't have the time to get them prescribed and have them for free . 
  2 tickets at a cinema ( av . 
  price for non 3d movies is 7 eur ) + pop corn , coke and water . 
  a taxi ride from the centre of athens to the northern suburbs with double tarif . 
  ( 00:00 - 05:00 ) when i move to a cheaper phone and internet plan it will be almost enough to buy me one month at 2 mbit ( please do n't laugh ... ) . 
  cause i currently pay 40something eur a month for a supposed 25 mbit that never , ever reaches more than 5 or so cause the wiring at my house is older than dirt . 
  it 's spanish . 
  it was an attempt at faulty towers humour but i guess it fell flat . 
  if i were french , i would have said quoi . 
  i like british culture , always have . 
  practically the sole thing i do n't like about the uk is the food and even that , not always . 
  you need to understand that it 's a completely subjective thing , as a person from the mediterranean these are the cuisines i like most . 
  i got butthurt myself because you said you wanted people to tell you what cuisines they liked best and then you proceeded to bite my head off for being honest . 
  then you listed a bunch of foods i was supposed to have sampled before daring to have an opinion . 
  wtf ever . 
  anyway , enjoy your food and i 'll enjoy mine . 
  peace . 
  i 've been to finland and stayed for about a week and i honestly ca n't remember anything about what i ate . 
  it 's just weird . 
  but i often dream about karelian pasties for breakfast , warm with some butter on top !, 
  epic !, 
  in general , you bread was great . 
  french ? 
  there 's a flag next to my name fer fuck 's sake !, 
  it looks french to you ? 
  and you call * me * ignorant ? 
  i know sandwiches were invented by a british earl but to go from that to calling them a quintessentially british food ? 
  reaching , non ? 
  i do n't give a rat 's ass about stargazy whatever and all the rest . 
  go away . 
  you ask a question and when people give an honest answer you just downvote and get all indignant and annoying . 
  i 've had enough of you . 
  butthurt much ? 
  yes , inedible to me , it 's subjective . 
  it 's also a stereotype that british food is bad and these often have their basis in truth . 
  do n't get so worked up about it . 
  laverbread ? 
  scouse ? 
  hotpot ? 
  * possibly culinary masterpieces but have no clue what they are . 
  ** bread and butter pudding ** meh , have had way better french desserts . 
  ** haggis ** ewwwww ** broth ** boring ** kedgeree , toad in the hole ** do n't sound too appetising ** black pudding ** tried it once . 
  regretted it . 
  ** stilton ** it stinks !, 
  ** worcestershire sauce and sandwiches ** you are claiming all sandwiches as british cuisine now ? 
  cool !, 
  i guess they 're ok . worcesteshire sauce is n't so bad but i can live without it . 
  i rated british food the lowest and i have lived in the uk for about six months and ate in restaurants , pubs , snack places and at family homes . 
  sorry , it 's a very subjective thing . 
  nothing that would be considered strictly british cuisine was particularly edible for me . 
  as a greek i am biased towards greek so i 'll just try to rate all the other cuisines that i have tried : good 1 . 
  italian 2 . 
  french 3 . 
  spanish mostly good 4 . 
  czech 6 . 
  hungarian 7 . 
  german 8 . 
  russian not so good 6 . 
  norwegian/swedish 7 . 
  dutch 8 . 
  belgian bad 9 . 
  irish 10 . 
  british i 've never had portuguese food and obviously i 'm missing out !, 
  i hope i can find a restaurant here somewhere . 
  well , hate to burst your bubble there but i live in greece and i see it a lot . 
  when dealing with americans i identify much closer with other europeans . 
  it often feels like americans are living in a world of their own . 
  then i identify with southern europe over northern and central . 
  then with my own country . 
  just guessing . 
  have never been to a concert with different prices for men and women .
