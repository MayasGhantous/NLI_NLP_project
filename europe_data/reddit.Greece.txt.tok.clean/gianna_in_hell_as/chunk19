  as a greek off the top of my head not counting lordi which is more hard rock than metal anyway : nightwish ( blech ) sonata arctica ( kinda blah ) children of bodom ( so and so ) amorphis ( pretty good ) ajattara korpiklaani finntroll a case could be made for apocalyptica, 
  baby boxes are better than finding dead babies in trashcans . 
  it 's that simple . 
  well , greece is darker but you guys have fleshgod apocalypse and they rule !, 
  there are limits to free speech when it comes to hate speech . 
  and there should be . 
  the golden dawn thugs want to have us living in fear . 
  they wo n't get their way . 
  you must understand , we are not demonising their opinions alone . 
  last year there were rumours they were going to be at the parade . 
  they did n't show up . 
  we are concerned about this year . 
  these guys are openly anti-gay and violent . 
  they march in random areas of athens assaulting anyone who looks leftist . 
  they have beaten up people , in one case i know , a girl for refusing to take their flyers and calling them names . 
  you just do n't understand what they are like and why we will not stand for it . 
  editted for clarity,

  crossposting in the other post too  you can also check out this response she gave in english to bbc , i think . 
  her english is not perfect but fairly decent so you should be able to get a good idea of what she 's talking about : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2tw8gy_6ek just one thing , she literally translates a greek saying when she says `` you can see the snake coming out of the egg '' it basically translates into `` now you can see their true colours '' about golden dawn .

  nice !, 
  i marched last year . 
  not sure i 'll make it this year but if i manage it , i 'll be there . 
  just hope the golden dawn thugs wo n't decide to show up . 
  :( doubt it , last year the only trouble we had was with some nutty christians but this year with all the attention golden dawn is getting , who knows ? 
  ahaha , yeah some people suggested that the reason he went so crazy is that she hit him with rizospasti ( communist newspaper ) . 
  it 's like showing the cross to a vampire . 
  she hit him with some rolled up papers and he slapped and punched her . 
  yeah , totally the same thing . 
  you obviously did n't watch the whole thing ... 
  he slaps the woman next to him several times . 
  golden dawn model themselves after the army so i bet he has a neighbour play the reveille for him round 5 am . 
  as for the rage , dunno , steroids ? 
  he 's the press representative for the party , i 'd say he represents them well ... 
  he beat up also the old guy and a bunch of techs who tried to contain him so he escaped and the police is still looking for him . 
  hope he 's arrested soon . 
  i like dimiourgia ksana . 
  i hope they make it to parliament . 
  it is a morning show . 
  i 'll give you a summary of what is being said because i did n't watch it either so not sure what started this discussion . 
  the woman is saying something about golden dawn working with the police . 
  the golden dawn thug says that syriza and the communist party ( her party ) has worked with the police and they admit it . 
  the woman says she does n't care about syriza , take it with them but regarding the communist party he 's a liar . 
  he calls her a stinking communist . 
  she says i wo n't let you turn me into a soap ( referring to the greek anti communist moto '' \u03a4\u03bf \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf \u03c3\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03b9 \u03b3\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03ba\u03bf\u03bc\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03b9 '' - communists make the best soap ) the blonde woman asks him if he got a continuance ( i think he had to go to court for something ) he says he did because of a clerical issue so what 's her problem ? 
  he then says ~ ~ to the communist woman ~ ~ to the blonde , apparently , `` i 'm dealing with those damned liars , its ' a liar from your party that is dragging us to court '' ( ~ ~ any greek who can suggest a better translation for \u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c6\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 , liars does n't seem strong enough ~ ~ the_soft_parade uses `` snitches '' in his translation below , i agree ) he continues : you are talking about a personal matter here and i wo n't let you ( i think he 's referring to his court case ) the blonde says : our problem is that this is an issue for democracy , it 's the fact that there are people elected to the greek parliament who will take the country 500 years back . 
  at this he throws the water on her and yells at her that she 's wrong . 
  papadakis ( the old guy ) tries to stop him and the golden dawn thug attacks the communist woman too but i 'm not very clear on that , she 's yelling something like `` get the hell out '' i think he slapped her like 3 times d : interesting how the other two men next to him just sat there doing nothing . 
  go papadakis ( it 's his show ) for trying to stop him , he 's like 70 years old !, 
  what investments ? 
  they want to nationalise everything , that 's not an investment , that 's suicide . 
  the greek public sector is inefficient and expensive and a huge burden . 
  and all those public interest companies have failed big time so nationalising them again is insanity . 
  and the economy will certainly not grow in a climate where everyone with money is considered the enemy . 
  even the few businesses that exist will have to close . 
  turkey ca n't invent provocation to attack ? 
  that 's news to me ... as for the combination of leaving nato and scaling down defence looks like a recipe for disaster . 
  cyprus tried it in 1974 and the result was the turks invading the northern part of the island which they still occupy until now . 
  i like to think that in 2012 greek - turkish armed conflict would not be likely but i 'd still rather not leave nato and align myself with russia and china and whatever other brilliant ideas the syriza people come up with . 
  cake !, 
  cake for everyone !, 
  i truly wish there could be some valid alternative because i hate both pasok and nd . 
  ideally i would vote for a smaller pro austerity party but none of them are likely to make it to parliament . 
  there are no alternatives . 
  oh , trust me , i have been looking for the exit for a while now . 
  i just do n't really want to leave because i love this place . 
  as for kaiadas , here 's hoping golden dawn does n't even make it to parliament . 
  i kinda doubt they 'll lose that many percentage points but it 's possible . 
  based on facebook , would it be too much to go to some acquaintances ' houses and lock them in on the 17th until the sun sets ? 
  hmmmm, 
  nationalising the banks ? 
  re-nationalising all the public interest companies which were a huge burden to the state and were losing money and we finally got rid of them ? 
  greece leaving nato and at the same time reducing army expenses ? 
  let 's just hope the turks wo n't be coming over for a stroll ... raising the minimum salaries ? 
  how are businesses supposed to survive ? 
  even more unemployed coming . 
  offering free healthcare to absolutely everyone how the fuck are we supposed to pay for it ? 
  and legalising all the immigrants ? 
  yay , we already have way too many , why do n't we fly in some more while we 're at it ? 
  they can all stay in alexis ' house . 
  dude , yeah , you want a huge state but you want the state to lose some serious money ... how in the world will the state pay for anything ? 
  syriza people are in their own world and people voting for them are so misguided it would be funny if it were n't pushing the country to the brink of disaster . 
  if this communist relic is the first party i 'm buying my ticket to anywhere else and they can all be retards together . 
  i 'm so out . 
  most of the voters i have been speaking to see it too and are mocking tsipras and syriza . 
  they said the only thing he did n't promise us is free love . 
  the problem is that i generally hang out with sane people :( not sure what the crazies are going to do . 
  i did n't even know this rag was still around , thanks reddit . 
  this is probably the not the place for this but i remember watching a comedy series in the greek state channel as a kid in the late 80s . 
  it was either dutch or german and the main character was a guy who worked in the eec ( what later became the eu ) . 
  i remember it being hilarious in how hopeless that guy was and all the different european stereotypes and mad internal world of the community . 
  i honestly do n't remember all that much , it was a goofy looking guy with a big nose and got in trouble a lot . 
  does that ring a bell with anyone ?
