  there are some awesome ticket prices to get to everywhere in europe if you reserve tickets early . 
  norway is ridiculously expensive but very beautiful . 
  if you plan to stay at a youth hostel while in athens , i have heard good things about [ city circus athens ] ( http://www.citycircus.gr/ ) . 
  when you have a better idea of your itinerary and more specific questions i would suggest going to country subreddits ( e.g. 
  r/greece ) and asking questions . 
  i am sure people will be glad to help you out . 
  you might also want to crosspost at r/travel . 
  i am sure there are other americans who have `` done europe '' and they would have more useful insights for you . 
  shaped like a boot . 
  elected cicciolina into parliament and she got there by showing her tit . 
  have had berlusconi governing for years and he is a complete tit . 
  huge differences between north and south and quite a bit of animosity there . 
  if it scares away russia , belarus and the rest of the homophobes i 'm all for all the countries sending drag queens . 
  is turkey over the freakout because of last year 's gay kiss ? 
  will drag queen austria scare them away again ? 
  ~ ~ i do n't know much about it but i 'm pretty sure we 're not in this year since we do n't really have a national broadcaster anymore . ~ ~ huh , it appears that private channel alpha took over the greek participation . 
  unlike cyprus who has the decency to not show up this year we will be there no matter how broke ... 
  i was thinking of azis too !, 
  he was there as a backing singer in 2006, 
  there actually was a huge debate with ` our ' generation split in two camps : lego and playmobile . 
  you chose one and only played with that . 
  lol , i 'd never thought of that but you 're right , it was the same for me . 
  my brother and i were playmobil fans and almost never played with legos . 
  i grew up in the 80s . 
  * games : * skiprope or double skiprope , everywhere you went some girls and sometimes boys would have set up some skiprope game going . 
  i am talking about a large skiprope that two girls were turning and people getting in the middle and jumping . 
  sometimes they would have two ropes to make an extra hard game . 
  koutso ( translates as lame , one-legged ) : grandma is teaching it in this [ video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp1f5kf6vr8 ) thanks for making me feel ancient , grandma . 
  everywhere you went there would be `` koutso '' boards drawn with chalk on the tiles . 
  lasticho ( elastic ) : as shown in this [ video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=holwbsyig7a ) , these are forms 1 to 5 . 
  i am not sure how far it went and doing them at this height was nothing , after that would come doing them on knee level and finally thigh level . 
  some other game that was a bit like tic tac toe but we played it with rocks on the ground and i can not for the life of me remember what it was called or what it was actually like . 
  * foods * for breakfast my parents would typically make me some bread with butter and honey or with merenda ( the greek version of nutella ) or they would give me some money to buy something at school since i was usually not that hungry in the morning . 
  before school age , i remember that raw beaten eggs with sugar was also a favourite for some reason . 
  it sounds gross now . 
  * toys * [ bibbi bo ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7w2-n2zeri ) , she was the greek answer to barbie . 
  she was supposed to look like brigitte bardot , i think but looking back she was very creepy looking . 
  handheld water toys , a bit like this [ one ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0ywtdhupn0 ) first nintendo handheld games , basically mostly [ donkey kong ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vgzptygxm4 ) some friends had computers but i did n't get one until i was 14 or so . 
  we played the computer versions of the usual arcade games that were out at the time . 
  * sweets and crisps * [ kiss ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6d82nrvdys ) [ derby ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dww5kxb4gya ) [ ion chocolate with almonds ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_g6y0e9ooo18/tvfzonm_gbi/aaaaaaaaa38/av2vzdpfn7q/s400/4792931904_f7c0975da7.jpg ) [ fountounia ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cun6oqjh2lg ) [ dracoulinia ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uzwsa6ayve ) * school uniforms/rules * i only wore a school uniform in the first year of school . 
  i was in cyprus at the time . 
  i do n't think we had school uniforms anymore in greece then . 
  rules depended on school . 
  usually boys were n't allowed to have long hair and girls had to dress fairly modestly and not wear any makeup . 
  i do n't think i ever wore hats . 
  as a greek woman i do n't find them progressive in the least . 
  of the little that i have seen i do n't like the ideas they promote . 
  an example , in 1000 and 1 nights , sechrazad sleeps with onur to get the money for her son 's leukemia treatment . 
  this guy basically blackmails her in order for her to sleep with him and her love changes him ( of course ) and they get together . 
  in karadayi the top female prosecutor ( who only got that spot cause her dad was a judge or some such ) acts like a freaking schoolgirl when she falls for her assistant , in this other , recent one , i forget the name , the girl is in love with a guy who participated in her gang rape and then was made to marry her to fix this ( but he 's nice and did n't really want to take part in that rape , apparently ) . 
  in suleyman i have completely lost track of what the hell was going on but i would call hurrem a complete psychopath , not brave . 
  still , i just know the highlights from my aunt who watches some turkish soaps religiously and it 's possible i 've gotten some things wrong . 
  however , they are generally better than some indian soap i caught where the women were getting beaten up . 
  it 's possible that you are both right . 
  there are crime shows where the inspiration for certain episodes are real life crimes . 
  law and order , for example . 
  i do n't know the case in question , though . 
  parents were criminally negligent for just abandoning their kids like that and if they had been working class they 'd have their kids taken into care for that shit instead of the sympathy they received . 
  however , there is no hard , irrefutable evidence that they murdered madeleine and covered it up . 
  i really think we should keep an open mind . 
  i second this . 
  i 've heard really good things about [ archelon ] ( http://www.archelon.gr/index_eng.php ) if op is the turtle saving type . 
  awesome !, 
  best of luck !, 
  there is a gypsy minority in greece who have actually settled down . 
  they have jobs and homes and they send their kids to school . 
  they can keep the non shitty parts of their culture ( their music , for example ) without abusing their children and being criminals . 
  it is possible and it has happened . 
  some gypsies lighten their hair , even on kids . 
  a few years back there was a big search for ben needham in greece . 
  he was a british boy that 's been missing since 1991 . 
  i remember that some years after the disappearance there was suspicion that gypsies had him because a kid around his age and matching his description was found in a camp . 
  turns out the kid 's hair was dyed and that he was n't gypsy but his father had left him at the camp and was paying for his keep . 
  i really hope it was n't a stolen child that you saw . 
  i know a woman who bought a gypsy kid . 
  she had been slated to adopt a kid but the couple changed their minds so in her desperation she bought one . 
  little guy was raised like a king . 
  luckily he was n't super dark and could pass for a darker greek . 
  a neighbour of ours got a romanian nanny for her kid . 
  i think she may have been gypsy but she did n't know that . 
  she was leaving the kid with that woman for 8 hours a day . 
  one day a friend of hers happened to be passing by omonoia ( a very very bad area of athens ) . 
  she saw a woman with a child begging . 
  she took a better look and it was her friend 's nanny with the baby , out to make some money !, 
  in general , if you see a gypsy woman begging with a baby it pays to take a good look at the kid . 
  very often it 's not even the same kid from day to day . 
  one of the `` mother 's '' many explanations was that she had it with a canadian . 
  i wish her every happiness . 
  our son is 8 months old now and i do n't even know how time passed . 
  if you do n't mind me asking , are you doing a home birth with a midwife ? 
  i was told that this was extremely popular in the netherlands and almost no one gives birth in hospitals . 
  news said that she speaks the roma dialect and understands some greek . 
  oookay . 
  thanks for explaining what you meant . 
  sorry to butt in but what 's an imma parade ? 
  googling did n't help . 
  i saw a news item a while back about two bulgarian girls who were trafficked and were forced to work in a circus in italy . 
  their owner would force them to be in a cage with snakes for their act !, 
  do n't think that girls who actually do work as maids are not often also losing their freedom . 
  there are cases where their boss takes away their passport and forces them to do more work for the money they are getting or even for no money at all .
