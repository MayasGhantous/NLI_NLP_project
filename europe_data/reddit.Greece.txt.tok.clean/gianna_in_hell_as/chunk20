  i 'm pretty sure the greek title translated into something like `` our man in the eec '' but the actual title could well be something completely different . 
  that 's not greek . 
  if it does n't say `` feta '' , it ai n't greek . 
  not sure it tastes like real feta , anyway . 
  i 've had many friends who were surprised when they tasted real greek feta . 
  though i 'll admit that for some the surprise was not a pleasant one . 
  from what i heard in the greek news something like 25,000 greeks have expressed interest in emigrating to australia since 2011 . 
  not sure how many of those have actually gone ahead with it . 
  i have a co-worker who is considering it along with her carpenter boyfriend and she could n't leave fast enough for me . 
  unfortunately it does n't look like they 'll leave after all . 
  i was scared to death as a pedestrian in rome . 
  i thought being greek it should n't be so bad for me but those guys make any street crossing a game of frogger . 
  not only do they not avoid taxes , salaried workers simply get buttfucked because of self-employed tax dodgers . 
  yay !, 
  the traffic code is basically a bunch of polite suggestions . 
  driving abroad has been an eye-opening and expensive experience for me . 
  i would comment on this but i 'm at work . 
  i am sick of paying for these parasites through my taxes . 
  i am sick of their rackets and bribes they demand for doing their job . 
  we had to pay 200 + euros for a freaking memorial service . 
  who knows how much the funeral had cost , i did n't have the strength to ask at the time . 
  bad enough they demand money for weddings , baptisms etc but a funeral ? 
  liars and cheats they should just go to hell . 
  i want to opt out of paying for the church . 
  why ca n't i do that ? 
  not to mention that everyone in the eu pays money to the freaking mt athos monastic community for preservation and the rest . 
  me and the other millions of women in the eu are paying to preserve a place we are not allowed to visit . 
  wtf ever !, 
  forever and ever . 
  the greek 2 euro coins depict the [ rape of europa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europa_ ( mythology ) ) . 
  this should have been your first clue . 
  silly man . 
  as long as cyprus votes , greece will never have anything under 12 points . 
  oookay , north korea , here we come . 
  op please put down the crack pipe . 
  i was out last night in halandri . 
  nice , upscale suburb so might not be very representative . 
  in a group of 5-6 young people only one was voting syriza and the rest were on his case all night trying to explain to him what a moronic decision he is making . 
  i have to hope that before june 17th enough people can be shown just how irresponsible it is to vote for populist , anti-memorandum parties . 
  also that if it were n't for that assclown tsipras and his delusions of grandeur we would have a government now . 
  aha , you 're making me curious about his show then . 
  i thought he was just a straight up chef . 
  will look him up . 
  it would just be kinda weird if the nazi was being interviewed by a chef . 
  the interviewer is called stavros theodorakis ( \u03a3\u03c4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2 ) . 
  i had to gooogle antony bourdain . 
  i ca n't say i see much of a resemblance . 
  good question . 
  probably will not lack that many deputies with some of the percentages i 've seen . 
  democratic left ( kouvelis ) the independent greeks ( kammenos ) ? 
  both ? 
  definitely not the communist party , that would never happen . 
  it is likely that drasi ( stefanos manos ) and the western alliance ( dora bakogianni ) will come to some agreement and choose a third person to lead the coalition . 
  i doubt that such a coalition would hit the 3 % threshold . 
  i suspect that their already meagre percentages will go even lower as people rush to new democracy hoping that it will beat syriza for the top spot . 
  oh , come on !, 
  not even if they form a committee !, 
  i do n't even know what spitha is : /, 
  these results make no sense . 
  i just do n't understand where syriza would get an extra 11 % . 
  it would get say , 2-3 % from democratic left and another 2 % from pasok as well as a bit from kke ( 1 % ? ), 
  but new democracy is going up and i seriously doubt any of the morons who are not willing to vote golden dawn again would vote syriza . 
  from voters moving to syriza it should get maybe 5-6 % . 
  +11 % looks insane !, 
  also , tsipras is a total assclown . 
  in athens we were given incentives to take our vacation during the olympics . 
  i strongly suggest they do the same in london . 
  we did n't have too bad traffic problems but then again not that many visitors bothered to come to the `` best olympics ever ! '', 
  elections again . 
  probably june 10th . 
  not fully decided yet but it definitely looks that way . 
  40 % that did n't vote are either dead ( last update was in 2001 , we had at least 2 deaths in our family alone , sure there 's more ) , out of the country ( and with good reason ) or they do n't vote where they live and could n't afford the freaking gas to make it to wherever it is they do vote . 
  i am sure there is a percentage that just could n't be bothered but they are not as many as they look . 
  sparta is also their heritage . 
  they go with that . 
  satanism is even stupider . 
  '' \u03b5\u03b3\u03ad\u03c1\u03b8\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9 '' is n't even that bad . 
  one of these morons yelled '' \u03b5\u03b3\u03ad\u03c1\u03b8\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf '' which does n't even mean anything . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://youtu.be/xz6xihafqfg ), 
  if the left ever unite , hell will freeze over . 
  the marxist leninist communist party did unite with the communist party ( marxist - leninist ) though . 
  i was talking to some americans online about [ this news story ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/24/whitney-kropp_n_1910290.html ) about a teen in the us who was voted to homecoming court as a prank . 
  apparently that 's a thing where the most popular kids get to dress up and present the teams that are gon na play american football ? 
  baseball ? 
  whatever . 
  i said that it 's really cruel to have popularity contests like that where students get to vote for their classmates for anything other than class president/student representative etc and also said that it 's not done in europe . 
  at least that 's just my impression from my schooling ( mostly greek ) . 
  what 's it like in your country ? 
  would you say there are contests like that just perfect to stress to kids how some of them are way more popular ? 
  how american are your schools ? 
  do you have proms ? 
  cheerleaders ? 
  prom kings , queens and whatnot or equivalents to all that ? 
  i need help with planning a train journey across europe for my brother .
