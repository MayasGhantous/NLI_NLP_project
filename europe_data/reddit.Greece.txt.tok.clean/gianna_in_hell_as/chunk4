  totally . 
  like hitler . 
  those germans !, 
  take out the police and uber love this list , 
  in no particular order : [ tzimis panousis - giagia patini ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bja0mhlp8hq ) [ nikolas asimos - o mpagasas ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd9hxeb06d8 ) [ pavlos sidiropoulos - to 69 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo9gs99pywu ) [ arleta - i serenata ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smlk1cuui7c ) [ giannis miliokas - gia to kalo mou ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j317duqkyvu ) [ dionysis savvopoulos - as kratisoun oi horoi ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkokdz2wxtm ) [ vasilis papakonstantinou - vrady savvatou ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8gs3fkjznu ) cheating a little with this one cause this particular cover version was out in 1992 but the original song was written in the 80s [ giannis giokarinis - eulampia ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwjcczm-1kw ) [ haris & panos katsimichas - rita ritaki ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwjcczm-1kw ) [ loukianos kilaidonis - tha katso spiti ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll7xfwdb8h8 ) phew , never thought i 'd manage this without karvelas or anna vissi !, 
  cheating also with two english language songs that i happen to like : [ costas charitodiplomenos - lost in the night ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0q1mnlcnsm ) italo disco hit [ sharp ties - get that beat ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzmq-jc6sdq ) ska, 
  same drug but wildly different doses . 
  and how can morning after pill be an abortion ? 
  it 's not certain there is even fertilisation !, 
  by that token women with iuds are also having a gazillion abortions since there is no implantation possible . 
  greece is n't influenced by any culture . 
  greece gave culture to everyone . 
  greece stronk !, 
  might be worth also to read milan kundera 's the joke . 
  i 've found it translated in greek so a dutch translation should exist too . 
  ahem , ca n't you germans consolidate ? 
  wow til , thanks . 
  this film was playing in an athens cinema for about 3-4 months non stop and it was full every night on word of mouth alone . 
  later on when it won the oscar i was so excited i yelled `` yes '' in the middle of the night and woke up my poor roommate . 
  pretty much all almodovar films should have subtitles available , he 's huge everywhere . 
  my fave almodovar film is * habla con ella * but only by a narrow lead . 
  i just adore his films . 
  all the good ones are taken so my knowledge that has not been shared already is mostly trash :*( a lot of greeks study medicine there . 
  unfortunately , from what they report , it is quite easy to bribe the professors into getting a passing grade so i think i 'll be avoiding romania educated doctors unless they are actual romanians . 
  they sent a [ contra tenor dressed as dracula dubstep guy in eurovision this year ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov3xp5zxsya ) that numa numa song and the numa numa video . 
  too funny !, 
  [ rembetiko ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ngp1fyfls&amp;feature=youtu.be ) it 's a movie about underground `` rembetika '' music in greece . 
  `` rembetika '' was in a way the greek `` blues '' . 
  it 's set in the 30 's if i remember correctly . 
  nicely made film and the music in it is excellent . 
  for something newer and artier i recommend [ dogtooth ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1379182/combined ) it is a hard film to watch and not necessarily particularly greek . 
  it reminded me of michael haneke films and also some danish dogme films . 
  nothing and you owe me a new keyboard , i just barfed all over it . 
  lol !, 
  as a greek i have said this will be my breaking point . 
  if it comes between syriza and golden dawn as main parties , forget about it , i 'm getting the first plane out of here . 
  it is not in any way equal . 
  i absolutely despise golden dawn . 
  i would prefer having 1 million antifas graffiti my entire city and burn my car ( as long as i was n't in it ) if it meant i could put all the golden dawn clowns and their supporters in a rocket and send them to the moon . 
  even if it would mean never seeing my uncle giorgos again who , believe it or not , votes gd but is otherwise one of the sweetest , most hospitable and wonderful people i have ever known . 
  seriously , i know it is n't coming across well and i know that the anti-leftist people have been using the marfin deaths over and over while it truly was a combination of factors that led to that accident and the bosses and unsuitability of the building were definitely primarily to blame . 
  it is not equal not in any way and i may disagree with a lot of things the antifas do or with how myself being middle class and moderately right wing i am a natural enemy to them . 
  still i respect them for wanting to fight for what is right and for protecting the weak . 
  not the same but does n't make party sanctioned vandalism and wanton destruction ok . 
  i also do n't forget the three dead at marfin bank . 
  was n't cold blooded murder but close enough . 
  but of course , the evil bosses murdered those people , not the scum who set fire to the building with them in it and were chanting to them that they deserved to die for not participating in the strike . 
  antifas have never been violent ? 
  they 've never hurt people and burned and destroyed private property ? 
  i think we have something of a persecution complex combined with delusions of grandeur and extreme pessimism but at the same time we love life and having fun . 
  i know all those things sound very contradictory but there it is . 
  we are also very compassionate . 
  it is hard for bosses to fire people . 
  we help others a lot . 
  we adore children , if i go out with my kid there are soooo many people who will make eye contact with him or just in general be very sweet about him . 
  i had n't realised that i kinda liked that until i went on holidays this summer and all the tourists were avoiding my kid and kept their face blank . 
  i am not saying it should be obligatory to worship my little snowflake but i had not really noticed that attention i was getting until it was gone . 
  also , if you wait in line and you 're pregnant or have a small kid people will let you pass in front . 
  a few years back i got stuck in frankfurt for 3 days around xmas . 
  it was complete chaos at the airport and we had to queue for 4 + hours to see where we 'd end up spending the night and whether we could be put in a different flight . 
  we met a very sweet australian couple with a 6 month old . 
  they too had to wait for 4 + hours with that poor baby , all tired and cranky and covered in baby vomit in the same clothes they 'd been wearing for 3 days . 
  that was such a shock to me . 
  it would not have happened in greece , airport officials would have had them jump the line . 
  i feel that not enough people go to milos . 
  the other islands in the cyclades like mykonos , santorini , paros and naxos get a lot of attention but milos is often overlooked . 
  i think it is one of the [ most ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kn8tf5zxaqs/tf9a5i8lfzi/aaaaaaaaecy/jyrahlszigi/s1600/papafragas-beach.jpg ) [ beautiful ] ( http://www.vacation-milos.com/images/beaches/tsigrado-small.jpg ) [ islands ] ( http://www.milos-island.gr/beaches/sarakiniko-beach.jpg ) in all of greece . 
  damnit , female but too old to be a valuable commodity in greece . 
  wow , you know your stuff  will check out these guys as well , thanks !, 
  i really like the album you linked for phoenix . 
  left it playing while i was doing some stuff around the house and it really worked for me . 
  but i 'm a sucker for 70s progressive rock so no wonder i liked it . 
  you 'll be fine . 
  only cities that appear are those that end up underwater . 
  athens is fine too . 
  i agree , even in songs i do n't like the language sounds gorgeous . 
  funnily enough i do n't particularly like spoken portuguese but sung it 's so lovely !, 
  you have a band called bambi molesters ? 
  i rather like fettes brot .

  chainides : [ i tigris ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzrskm-j2bi ) the tiger , sung by the amazing psarantonis , cretan singer and lyra player who is just unbelievable . 
  i know many metalheads who adore this man . 
  i 'd better end this here or i 'll not get anything done today . 
  this list is not by any means exhaustive but i urge you to listen to a few songs from it !, 
  thanks !, 
  oh , i 'm sorry if jam would be unheard of  when trying foods i know little about i am prone to experimentation . 
  you should see me in a chinese restaurant dipping everything in all the sauces . 
  i 've gotten some looks from the servers ... 
  it 's a dinner party where the guests bring a dish they prepared themselves . 
  but next time you can also google it . 
  i 'll take potato salad on the side of my schnitzel .

  the sweet quark cheese dumplings are giving me a food boner .
