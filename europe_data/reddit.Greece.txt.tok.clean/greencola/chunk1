maybe because greece was subjected to at least [ twice ] ( http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/greece-government-reforms-by-yanis-varoufakis-2015-05 ) the austerity compared to portugal . 
  it 's hard to convince people that austerity is working when your country 's gdp was 50 % higher just a few years back .

   nor am i interested in making such a claim i understand that you 're not interested in making such a claim , but if you look at where this thread started , you 'll see that someone asked :  so tax evasion is part of greek identity ? 
  my reply was that the typical greek does not do that , just a wealthy minority . 
  the paper you showed me does not , by any means , contradict with what i said . 
  on the contrary , it fully supports my claims . 
  thanks for the paper , i was n't aware of that research . 
  first of all , the paper looks at * self-employed * people and estimates which industries are tax-evading the most . 
  their results correlate well with what i had in mind , which is , the biggest tax evaders in greece are the doctors and the lawyers ( p. 48 ) . 
  does this paper prove that the average greek is tax evading ? 
  does it prove that tax-evading is `` part of greek identity '' ? 
   the highest tax evaders are the highly educated and powerful professions in greece . 
  ( p. 36 ) the answer is no . 
  because : 1 ) most greeks ( 65 % ) are wage earners and can not tax-evade , and 2 ) from those that are self-employed , the majority of tax evaders ( by mean value of tax evasion ) are in specific ( well known ) industries that are characterized by very high incomes . 
  do you agree with me or not ? 
  even if we accept the numbers you 're presenting , and even if we all agree that 100 % of the greek debt is attributed to tax evasion , you 're still missing the point of my post . 
   the average greek does not tax evade . 
  a salaried employee can not do that . 
  the majority of tax evasion is from big corps , and rich guys like doctors and lawyers . 
  some small shop owners do that too , but that 's far from saying `` part of greek identity '' . 
  that 's what i said . 
  show me that the average greek is stealing from the state or has been historically doing that . 
  where did you read that only 32 % of taxes are collected ? 
  where were you between 11.30 and 11.45 this morning ? 
   only thing we can blame on the ordinary greeks are that they have elected corrupt officials . 
  and i think most greeks will agree with you . 
  but then again younger greeks had no part in this , they just found themselves in the `` middle of the war '' . 
  yeah , i 'm sure when someone blames lazy/corrupted/tax evading greeks is referring to the tsipras government . 
  i have no reason to take it personally . 
   it 's only greece under syriza where it failed . 
  that 's not true . 
  check this [ post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3djd22/greek_economy_was_not_doing_well_until_january/ ) . 
  i do n't know what others did , but i upvoted you . 
  indeed , that 's a fact , i read it somewhere a few years ago . 
  ** but ** . 
  that does not , by any means , prove the ridiculous statement that we read over and over again that greeks are tax evading . 
  the average greek does not , and can not , tax evade . 
  the corrupted politicians and the elite , on the other hand , are a different story ... 
  why do you assume that greeks started those hashtags , and more importantly , why do you assume that greeks or anybody in the world is using those hashtags to attack german people ? 
  almost all shops accept debit cards , but i 'm not sure what 's happening with credit cards these days . 
  basic commerce functions , but everybody is reluctant to use cash for taxis , cafeterias , subway etc. 
  i read somewhere that we are losing 1 % of gdp every week the banks are closed . 
   blame either goldman sachs who aided your politicians in cooking your books or your politicians we do blame * our * politicians for indebting us and starting the crisis of 2009 . 
  some of them are already in jail . 
  but we also blame * your * politicians for indebting us even further from 2009 to 2015 . 
  so far we are not blaming people of other countries , so i 'm not sure why you mention that . 
   what we currently have is the worst of both worlds , austerity with no actual reforms to go with them and loans taken out that are n't invested into infrastructure . 
  the only winners are the fat cats in the cities of london and frankfurt and the criminals at goldman sachs who caused this mess in the first place by cooking greece 's books . 
  i could n't agree with you more . 
  what ? 
   carefully ommiting the other points . 
  no , i just omitted the parts that are off-topic . 
  you are trying to start a discussion on every single thing that * you think * went wrong since the 70s , while this thread is about * tax evasion in 2015 * . 
   it 's not my fault that the majority subscribes to at least some of the describtions . 
  no , your fault is that you are blindly assuming that , without questioning whether you have enough data to make that assumption . 
  the majority of greeks are certainly not landlords , or self-employed , and even from those , not everybody are crooks !, 
  do n't generalize , it 's not nice . 
   as much as your biased view i 'm not the one who 's biased here my friend . 
  selectively picking events from the last 40 years of greek history and presenting them in a way that makes my nation look bad , * does not prove anything about vat tax evasion * , which is of course the topic of this thread . 
  this only proves that you 're biased . 
  aggressively trying to blame a whole nation for stuff is by definition racist . 
   typical leftist mentality i 'm not a leftist . 
   i bet even you ' v personally not taken a vat receipt or chosen the cheaper way for a service or good , but think it does n't really make a difference that 's the problem , you are just assuming stuff , while i 'm talking about the reality in greece for those in reddit that are interested to learn more . 
   small things add up really fast big things add up faster my friend ... 
   the majority of tax evasion is from big corps , and rich guys like doctors and lawyers . 
  i already said who are responsible for the majority of tax evasion . 
  putting the blame on the average greek is just ignorant and plain racist . 
   something all greeks do no , that 's not true . 
  simple as that . 
  no , that 's media bias . 
  trying to put the blame of the $ 320bn debt to the poor guy for not charging vat when selling tomatoes is ridiculous . 
  first of all , the average greek does not tax evade . 
  a salaried employee can not do that . 
  the majority of tax evasion is from big corps , and rich guys like doctors and lawyers . 
  some small shop owners do that too , but that 's far from saying `` part of greek identity '' . 
   60 % voted `` no '' and about 70 % want to stay in the euro . 
  yes , however the first number is from the referendum while the second number is from polls . 
  and we all know how accurate polls are ... 
  nevertheless , i understand that tsipras was between a rock and a hard place . 
   mp kyriakos mitsotakis , son of former prime minister konstantinos mitsotakis ... and brother of mp dora bakoyannis ... 
  the problem is not austerity . 
  the problem is a country with no prospect of recovery . 
  to answer your question , yes , this year changed everything ... 
   also is greece 52 % on agree that was in 2014 . 
  the percentage supporting a federation now is probably on par with the uk . 
  nope . 
  that big smile was the result of being served coffee by [ merkel ] ( http://www.iefimerida.gr/sites/default/files/tsipras-merkel-kafes-708.jpg ) . 
  that 's impossible . 
  / r/europe is irreversible . 
  now where can i borrow some reddit gold ... * edit : * thanks , gib more reddit gold !, 
  i do n't argue , but that 's what the article says ... 
   growing anger among some greeks over the coverage of the referendum , according to german news website focus , which one of the main gripes being that private broadcasters are too biased in their reporting . 
  even if we accept what you 're suggesting and 75 % of total pensioners are in the public sector and ika , the article says that 75 % of those enjoy early retirement , which is ~ 56 % of total pensioners ( 75 % of 75 % ) . 
  i confirm , title is misleading . 
  it should say : * 75 % of public sector and ika pensioners are opting for early retirement * . 
  after all the average age of retirement in 2012 was at [ 62 ] ( http://www.oecd.org/els/emp/ageingandemploymentpolicies-statisticsonaverageeffectiveageofretirement.htm ) . 
  i also want to note that : 1 . 
  i know many people that opted for early retirement during the last few years , in anticipation of troika increasing the retirement age .
