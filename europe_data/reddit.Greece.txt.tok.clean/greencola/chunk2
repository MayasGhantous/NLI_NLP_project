  afaik early retirement means that you take a big penalty on your pension . 
  link ? 
  thanks for the suggestion , but i 'll keep blaming idiots that talk out of their asses . 
  thanks for editing your comment . 
  this wikipedia [ article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tax_evasion_and_corruption_in_greece#extent_of_greek_tax_evasion ) that says 49 % of the greek ** population ** in 2005 were tax evaders is wrong . 
  i read the referenced article , which is in greek , and it clearly says 49 % of the ** companies that were inspected ** in 2005 were tax evaders . 
  i would appreciate if you either reference a credible source for your claim , or remove it . 
  saying that 49 % of greeks are crooks just because you read it `` somewhere '' is very insulting . 
  sorry , did n't get that !, 
  did you check the wikipedia article , though ? 
  it 's dead wrong . 
  link ? 
  because the wikipedia [ article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tax_evasion_and_corruption_in_greece#extent_of_greek_tax_evasion ) says that 49 % of the greek ** population ** in 2005 were tax evaders , but the referenced article actually says that 49 % of the ** companies that were inspected ** were tax evaders ... 
   so you do n't get to shift blame on anyone but yourselves for this . 
  hey , do n't be so hostile . 
  believe it or not , some of us were quite young 10 years ago . 
  what 's the figure for 2015 ? 
  ** edit : ** as i said to others , the wikipedia article you linked is dead wrong . 
  it says 49 % of the greek * population * in 2005 were tax evaders and references an article that says 49 % of the * companies that were inspected * in 2005 were tax evaders . 
  that 's why people say never reference wikipedia articles in your posts ... 
   49,5 % of greeks that evaded taxes what ? 
  1 in 2 evading taxes ? 
  are you sure you did n't read 1 in 2 * can not * pay taxes ? 
  that would make much more sense ... 
   what makes this specific proposal if i understand correctly you 're basically asking why a referendum was necessary for that proposal ... ** my ** point of view is that our government failed to negotiate an acceptable deal for us . 
  they promised , they tried , they failed . 
  an acceptable deal , from the government 's perspective , would include hard measures + debt restructuring . 
  the best offer they managed to get , after 4 months of negotiations , is the one on june 26th . 
  it includes hard measures , but no debt restructuring . 
  so the government says that proposal sucks and they ca n't pass that through the parliament . 
  that 's why they ask what the people want . 
  do they want to accept that proposal ( or a similar subsequent one ) just to secure our place on ez , or keep insisting on debt restructuring even if that means we 'll have to exit the ez ? 
  it 's a yes/no vote on the latest proposal from troika ( dated june 26th i think ) . 
  they know what it is for . 
  but you asked what the consequences would be ... 
   one of the biggest people gatherings on ** syntagma square ** in history, 
  that 's cool . 
  it would be interesting to see the same maps but with gnp per capita normalized to the highest value . 
  was n't a few days ago when esm said that the greek debt is sustainable ? 
  so i ** did n't ** say that !, 
  i rest my case . 
   because your statment that germany started ww1 and when did i say that ?!, 
  go ahead , quote me . 
   but really how do you not know the history of ww1 i know ww1 history , son , better than most people !, 
  thank you very much . 
  your argument about ww1 is ** irrelevant ** to the point i 'm trying to make . 
  please understand what you 're reading , before replying !, 
  so you agree with all my other points ... 
  un-freakin-believable . 
  after destroying europe twice and all the atrocities committed , germany of 1953 is presented as having the ethical edge over greece of 2015 !, 
  * voted for nazis ? 
  * you 're a victim , here 's debt relief . 
  * voted for nd/pasok ? 
  * you deserve any disaster coming your way , here 's doom and destruction . 
  ignorance reached new levels . 
   merkel herself has offered partly debt relief to greece no , she has n't !, 
  i know that because if she did , we would all be on syntagma square now dancing naked and drinking ouzo . 
   together with an aid program and investments of 35 billion $ . 
  that 's from the eu and ( depending on the terms ) that 's amazing . 
  but ... debt restructuring ... 
   he said that another round of harsh austerity measures without a debt relief is an unsustainable solution that . 
  debt restructuring has been their number one priority from the very start . 
  it 's really surprising how under-reported that has been . 
  i do n't even think they care that much about pensions and taxes ( so long as they do n't lose face ... ) . 
  great wikipedia article , but i 'll also quote what the council of europe says about austerity , because you know ... it does n't support your point of view at all . 
   many of these austerity measures ... 
  the whole spectrum of human rights has been affected -- from the rights to decent work , an adequate standard of living and social security to access to justice , freedom of expression and the rights to participation , transparency and accountability, 
  ehhhhh ... what the hell did i read just now ... ? 
  you 're right . 
  we are unemployed and stuck in a holiday resort . 
  so ... holidays . 
  i doubt if any significant reforms were made in greece during the last 5 years . 
  but i could be wrong . 
  most of the measures that i 'm aware of ( firsthand ) were cutbacks , tax increases and extraordinary taxes . 
  damn them !, 
  lost my chance to use my [ mastercard ] ( http://imgur.com/cwyqtmu ) \u2122 to bailout my country !, 
   possibly dragging down the entire eurozone and just reinforcing the crisis ? 
  you seem to suggest that defaulting now has less consequences ... 
  i hate to be the party pooper , but as of today we can not transfer money abroad ( capital controls ) , so it wo n't be possible to bailout ourselves through indiegogo !, 
  i clearly explained where your government 's fault lies and it 's not what you said . 
  it 's not a matter of what it feels . 
  and that 's the problem . 
  feelings are easily manipulated by the media . 
  it 's all about facts . 
  our economy in 2009 had problems ( but not even close to current problems ) , ez countries promised to help and in return we promised to take measures . 
  however , after 5 years of doing what they asked our economy was totally destroyed . 
  and the worst part is that ez countries seem to blame ** us ** for the failure , no responsibility on their part . 
  so , many greeks are like wtf ? 
   imaginary hurdles not at all . 
  unless you are arguing about the total level of the bailout package , in which case , you are right $ 30bn is just an estimate . 
  i agree , a yes is not a better deal , it 's definitely a worse deal . 
  as i said , it all comes down to how much we trust them with our future . 
  obviously , not everybody has the same opinion . 
  i would n't be surprised at all if after a yes , sch\u00e4uble said * greeks want a deal , but german law does n't allow blah , blah ... * . 
  after following the negotiations very closely during the last few months , i 'm convinced that they do n't want a deal . 
  tsipras is doing them a favor . 
  well , if you have a cousin like that , he sucks . 
  but no . 
  if you 're trying to convince me that i 'm responsible for the economic situation in greece during the last 5 years , with troika in charge , i 'm sorry , but no . 
  i can accept that i 'm somewhat responsible for the debts accumulated in greece up to 2009 ( even though i was young back then ) .
