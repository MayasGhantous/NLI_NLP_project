  this is just one part of it . 
  as the article says , if china wants it to get done to save them time/money over the long-term they will do it . 
  honestly did n't know , i have n't been on r/europe for a few days . 
  the loan was only made because greece pledged to sell 50-60 billion euros worth of greek state assets . 
  you make it seem like this was charity . 
  just to point before there a thousand comments saying `` well germany will never get the rest back ! '', 
  i want to point that there is absolutely no evidence or support that greece will refuse to pay back debt and in fact it has made every step to show that it will pay everything back over the next few decades . 
  you make it seem like turkey was some beacon of democracy before erdogan , it never was and it never will be . 
  closing borders does n't change much , also italy/greece do not have to do anything to get rid of the migrants . 
  there are dozens of billion-euro smuggling networks and hundreds of gangs now whose sole means of income is smuggling of these people , it is safer , less risk and nearly as profitable as drug smuggling so a lot of criminals are turning to it . 
  the only way to stop these migrants is to stop them before they ever reach europe , if they are allowed to stay they will eventually go north , it just depends if they will do it the legal way or just get easily smuggled through using one of the countless gangs that offer this service . 
  good point , i am with you that these multi-millionaire/billionaire shipping oligarchs need to be taxed . 
  greek government should also create a law that if they do not pay increased taxes and decide to move to panama/liberia that they are banned from greek waters which is basically half the eastern med . 
  i would love to see them move to panama then . 
  for most northern euros it is pretty cheap , it is all relative . 
  [ greece might break the 30 million barrier this summer ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2017/07/06/pm-tsipras-greece-will-break-through-the-30-million-visitor-barrier/ ) which was though impossible only a few years ago , if not this year than surely next , especially with the new chinese tourism deal . 
  i see this becoming much more common in the future . 
  [ turkey 's government ] ( http://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2016/11/30/turkeys-opposition-challenges-erdogan-to-take-back-18-islands-occupied-by-greece/ ) and opposition are delivering a nationalistic race targeting greece and cyprus . 
  after erdogan 's spin on the lausanne treaty , the `` borders of our heart '' and cyprus flag , the kemalists from chp joined the chorus asking him to reveal when exactly he plans to `` take back 18 islands '' from greece !, 
  speaking at the parliamentary party group but addressing the prime minister , binali yildirim , the leader of ataturk 's republican party chp , kemal kilicdaroglu said  `` in cyprus , this time the trnc * has 37 % of the land . 
  they want to reduce it to 29.2 % . 
  they want to sell cyprus . 
  we ask them : is this island ours ? 
  yes , they say . 
    should our flag be on these islands ? 
  yes , they say . 
  but there , there is the flag of greece . 
  then why do n't you intervene ? 
  we ask them . 
  and what do they answer ? 
  we have more important things to do , we have a leader and we are seeking a chair for him . 
    the greek flag is waving on 18 islands . 
  these islands belong to us . 
  when we hear the rooster crow . 
  there is the greek flag . 
  they are under occupation . 
  they speak about the lausanne saying ` we lost territories . ' we lost 18 islands under our nose . 
  and now i ask binali yildirim . 
  will you take back the 18 islands or not ? 
  are you nationalist or not ? '' ( via sigmalive ),

  i understand , i am sure iceland is amazing since it is a pretty unique place . 
  if i did have to spend winter anywhere it would be iceland . 
  it sounds nice until you actually live in it , have you ever lived in a place where you have to shovel snow 2 hours a day for months ? 
  for me its not really about the sun or darkness it 's about sun type activities vs cold/dark type activities . 
  in dodekanese where it is strong sun for 300 days a year i always have something to do outside , especially with other people even to meet new people , things like the beach , hiking or sports activities are very very common since it is always sun out and people want to move about outside since it is so nice . 
  when i was living in one of the minimum sunlight places where it is always cold , cloudy and dark i got very depressed since there was not much i could do . 
  i felt like i was trapped indoors all day from the cold and the days that were not cold and had free time it seemed like the sun was always being blocked from clouds and related to that it felt like nobody was outside doing active things , it was like everyone was indoors , which made me depressed . 
  i much prefer the sunlight and super-active lifestyle . 
  if you have money already then it would make sense , otherwise it would be dumb . 
   it 's sickening the way they victimize themselves 90 % of posts by turkish redditors on this sub is self-victimization . 
  just look at this thread , it is everyone else but turkeys fault that christians are treated like sub-humans in turkey . 
  do n't even get started on the armenian/greek genocides , turks were the biggest victim of those genocides according to turkish redditors . 
  70-90 % of all christian greeks were murdered by turkish/kurdish forces , only the survivors managed to reach greece . 
  although greece did send all the muslims to turkey without a scratch , greece was never going to genocide innocents even after the events that happened in turkey .
