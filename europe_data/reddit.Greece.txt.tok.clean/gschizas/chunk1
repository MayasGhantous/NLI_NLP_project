it 's 1 & # 160 ; & #x 20ac ; = 340,75 & # 160 ; & #x 20af ; , but the usual conversion was 3 & # 160 ; & #x 20ac ; = 1000 & # 160 ; & #x 20af ; that being said , i have even converted in my mind the price of my first car . 
  even though i paid that in drachmas and not in euros , i remember its price in euros and i have to calculate its price in drachmas . 
  even weirder : it was a nice round ( - ish ) number in drachmas ( 4.450.000 & # 160 ; & #x 20af ; , but i remember its price as `` about 13.000 & # 160 ; $ '' ) ...

  see this [ excel file ] ( http://storage.eba.europa.eu/documents/10180/851797/2_summary_individual%20banks.xlsb ) edit : or [ this interactive map ] ( https://www.eba.europa.eu/risk-analysis-and-data/eu-wide-stress-testing/2014/results/map-tool-1?p_p_id=56_instance_6s0nhgtibilz&amp;p_p_state=exclusive ), 
  i find that the most useful stuff is in the [ second excel file ( requires excel 2010 or newer ) ] ( http://storage.eba.europa.eu/documents/10180/851797/2_summary_individual%20banks.xlsb ), 
  the hero in this case is the man that wrote the koi8_r characters by hand . 
  i mean , talk about dedication ( and it seems he did n't make any mistake there  ), 
  i actually did , but i forgot that there are multiple russian decoders . 
  i used cp1251 , but i probably should have used koi8_r so , here it is with koi8_r : \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f , \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430 , 119415 \u043f\u0440.\u0412\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e , 37 , \u043a .1817 -1 . 
  actually , no . 
  it definitely not a font , its handwritten . 
  it seems to me that some printer only had latin encoding ( code page 1252 ) and it was fed cyrillic data ( code page 1251 ) . 
  the result is that for every cyrillic letter , the letter at the same code point was substituted . 
  after the label being misprinted , some poor schmo used the label to write the actual addres , by copying each letter by hand ( and probably making a few mistakes on the way ) . 
  edit 2 : i found the wikipedia page that uses to display that image : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mojibake edit 3 : disregard , this is only one of the russian encodings . 
  i added koi8_r as well, 
  hey , it 's not that diffucult : \u00d2\u00cf\u00d3\u00d3\u00c9\u00d1 , \u00ed\u00cf\u00d3\u00cb \u00d7 \u00c1 , 119415 \u00d0\u00d2 . \u00f7 \u00c5\u00d2\u00ce\u00c1\u00c4\u00d3\u00cb\u00cf\u00c7\u00cf , 37 , \u00cb .1817 -1 .

  this is for german , but it 's strangely to the point : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg62zay3kck btw , i have great respect for the dutch , because they are the only ones in europe ( well , apart from greeks of course ) that can pronounce my username ( which is also my surname ) . 
  you can hear it here : https://translate.google.com/#el/en/%ce%a3%cf%87%ce%af%ce%b6%ce%b1%cf%82, 
  hush now . 
  we gave the language to everyone . 
  we own the copyright for '' \u00a8 ''  ( also , when we were building parthenons , you were up on the trees , eating acorns  ) ^ ( i 'm being sarcastic of a kind of `` super '' greek , do n't take what i say literally ), 
  actually , it 's from the greek \u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03b1\u03ca\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 . 
  ai ( \u0391\u03b9 ) is a diphthong in greek , pronounced `` eh '' ( long-ish ) . 
  a\u00ef ( \u03b1\u03ca ) is for when you want the sound `` ah-ee '' ( or perhaps ayeeee - or in greek , \u03b1\u03ca\u03ca\u03ca\u03ca\u03ca\u03ca\u03ca\u03ca  ) . 
  the '' \u00a8 '' symbol is called '' \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bb\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac '' ( dissolvents ? ), 
  in greek , because it dissolves the `` ai '' ( \u03b1\u03b9 ) diphthong . 
  why not link to the english article instead ? 
  i had one for 11 years ( 2001-2012 ) . 
  it 's very much like a volkswagen , although it 's a bit sportier and cheaper . 
  seat ( all capitals ) means spanish touring car society in spanish . 
  the seat ibiza is very much like a vw polo , the seat leon is very much like a vw golf ( they are based on the same platform etc. ) . 
  they have different aesthetics , going for a less conservative view , and they used to have more powerful engines ( because the parent company vw did n't care as much for their reliability , so they used seat as a bit of a testbed ) . 
  my own seat ibiza 101 hp , which was a lot for its 1400 cc engine ( it took many years to see a 1400 cc engine that was as powerful , and it still is high today for a non-turbo engine ) . 
  i do n't know about tyrol ( how it relates to the rest of austria ) , but cyprus was indeed very isolated ( by sea of course , not by mountains ) , and it has very different linguistic influences . 
  it resembles ancient greek a bit more than mainland greek , and it has more turkish and english influences than them . 
  then again , there are quite a lot of areas in greece that have developed under different influences . 
  there were areas that were almost constantly under turkish occupation , there were other areas that were under italian occupation etc. 
  the second least intelligible dialect is probably cretan , although since crete has been a part of the greek state for much longer ( cyprus declared independence from uk in 1960 , after being `` gifted '' to uk from turkey in 1878 , crete was united with greece in 1908/1913 after being declared semi-independent in 1898 ) . 
  the ionian islands ( the islands closer to italy , on the west ) have definite italian ( venetian ) influences , and their accent is a lot more like singing . 
  i could go on of course ; i do n't think there is any large area of greece that does n't have a very distinct accent . 
  sadly the differences are gradually disappearing ( i 'd say mostly because of tv ) , so this is n't as pronounced as it once was . 
  the first theatrical play that was written after the liberation from ottoman rule was called `` babylonia '' , by dimitrios vyzantios ( real name : dimitrios hadjiaslanis ) , which satirized exactly the mutual unintelligence between the greek dialects . 
  the main plot point ( well , i 'd say `` spoiler '' , but you 'd need to know greek very well to understand the movie - due its nature it 's virtually untranslatable ) is the confusion that occurs because in crete the word `` kouradia '' means `` sheep '' , while in mainland greece `` kourades '' means `` feces '' . 
  edit : babylonia was published in 1836 , and it refers to an event that happened in 1827 . 
  it is a dialect , but it can be unintelligible ( mainland greeks may not understand cypriot greek at all , but it 's not mutual ), 
  for a subreddit that claims to be for `` free speech '' ( which in their case means racist speech ) , it 's at least suspicious they do n't have downvote buttons . 
  yes . 
  it 's as silly as it sounds . 
  no , you were a financial group  ( efg = european financial group ), 
  efg bank was n't a thing in greece . 
  efg group was a thing , but it 's not anymore . 
  the bank itself was called efg eurobank ergasias , then about two years ago it changed its name to eurobank ergasias , dropping the efg , as the prime stockholder ( indeed spiros latsis ) decided to split off the main private bank in switzerland ( which was * renamed * to efg bank ) and split the remaining eurobank ergasias to his 9 heirs ( mostly grandchildren and the latsis foundation ) . 
  if that was n't complicated enough , about a year later , the 9 stockholders bought 10 % of nbg ( national bank of greece , the oldest and once largest bank of greece ) in exchange for the 45 % of eurobank ergasias they owned , in anticipation of a merger . 
  that merger was canceled . 
  so now the heirs of spiros latsis each own about 1 % of nbg , and have no relationship with eurobank ergasias . 
  spiros latsis retains major stockholder status for efg bank , but this is based in switzerland , while the group hq is in luxembourg . 
  greece : * ** indian summer ** : i do n't think i 've ever heard this as a phaenomenon . 
  then again , all of our summer is hot , so ... we have the opposite thing though , a time in january where there is good weather with sunshine etc. 
  we call those \u0391\u03bb\u03ba\u03c5\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2 / alkyonides meres/days of the halcyon/kingfisher . 
  well , it was a greek word anyway . 
  so , * ** sunshower ** : we do n't have a special word for it either . 
  ilios kai fengari , pantrevontai oi gaidaroi/sun and rain , the poor marry . 
  sun and moon , the donkeys marry . 
  not very original , literally just the words snow and water slapped together ... 
  very patiently .

  i agree regarding the two posts .
