  i 'm not really an expert in proper titles , but if it * is * for the european games ( i do n't speak azerbaijani , so i ca n't judge ) , i 'd say `` stray dogs ( or `` stray puppies '' ) are being burnt alive in preparation for the 2015 european ( olympic ) games ( nsfw/nsfl animal cruelty ) '' . 
  i can see now that your title is much better than i originally thought , so i 'll re-approve it . 
  removed for editorialization . 
  since the youtube title is useless , you may resubmit it with a title of your own , that accurately depicts what is this video about ( for example , `` azerbaijan animal cruelty '' or something ) . 
  please refrain from inserting your opinion in the title of your post . 
  the whole `` you really have to see this '' is probably the main reason the `` no editorializing '' rule was invented in the first place . 
   3.3 to 7 births per woman . 
  when you get enough money that giving birth to a child virtually ensures that the same child will reach adulthood , the `` births per woman '' number drops to western-world levels . 
  i think you 'll find your time estimation is mistaken : http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/russia/moscow, 
  not easter for us . 
  so , nothing special . 
  ask again on may 1st ( and/or april 30th ), 
  using accusative in place of dative does n't count as dative though . 
  we have changed quite a lot of things , apart from that : * no more dual number ( that 's archaic greek though ) * simplified past tenses * added separate future tenses * no attic declension all that off the top of my head . 
   we deactivated the polytonic system in the 60 's or 70 's 1982 . 
  well , the fact that modern greek has 4 cases and ancient greek had 5 ( we dropped the dative ) is a very big difference . 
  what * you * are doing is * honoring * rome , italy . 
  same as with athens , georgia . 
  we are actually proud and flattered an athens , georgia exists . 
  you are not usurping the name , you are showing your respect for it . 
  it 's fundamentally different . 
  that 's not really true . 
  we are called : * ** greeks ** in most languages ( mostly western ) . 
  a name that derives from a tribe in north-western greece . 
  * ** ionians ** ( yunan ) in a lot of languages ( mostly eastern ) . 
  a name that derives from the group of tribes that colonized asia minor ( what is now turkey ) * ** hellenes ** by a few languages ( including norwegian , for some reason ) . 
  a name that derives from another tribe in north-western greece . 
  * ** saberdzneti ** by georgians . 
  the name ( probably ) derives from pelasgians , the name for proto-greeks or even pre-greeks ( that were living in greece before the first greek tribes emigrated to greece ) the selloi ( dodonaioi ) and graeci ( the names from where hellas and greece come from ) were two tribes in north-western greece ( thesprotia , epirus , to be exact and later thessalia ) , living near dodoni , where the oracle for zeus ( jupiter ) was located . 
  in fact they were probably living in the same place , and the names were almost interchangeable . 
  this leaves out more names , such as romioi ( literally romans , as what we called byzantium was called the eastern roman empire until its fall in 1453 ) , achaioi ( what ancient greeks at the time of homer were calling themselves ) and probably more . 
  there 's a rumor that this song was indeed written for his wife . 
  its counterpart : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmkclj1tdre, 
  well , there are for example the loans in a foreign currency , which have the inflation of the foreign currency as a different thing from the interest . 
  recent example , a lot of mortgages in greece were taken in swiss francs . 
  they had some normal interest , and when switzerland unpegged the franc and let it climb to its true market value , the people who took the loan were thoroughly screwed . 
  note : this is n't the reason for greece 's debt crisis . 
  it 's just insult added to injury ( or as we say , the cherry on top of the cake ) . 
  actually , it would be a very bad loan if it * did n't * have inflation . 
  it 's usually included in the interest though . 
  $ 300,000 * per car *, 
  they 're worth $ 300,000 * with interest and inflation * . 
  for a car of 1974 , the retail price would be in the neighborhood of $ 3000 or so . 
  but that was 1974 prices . 
  no , it is n't . 
  check more closely .

  how about this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lyre ( it 's not bowed , but it was played both like a guitar and like a harp ), 
  it 's not really a software company ( i 'm employed in a large company ) , but i keep the name for my personal stuff . 
  the name itself does n't mean much , it 's mostly related to my first name ( george = gaia + ergon = earth + work ) . 
  themes : grounded ( i represent that with an inverse triangle , for some reason ) , and some kind of globe . 
  my theme colors are dark gray and orange ( or rather orangered ) . 
  this is what i 've made in the past ( do n't open the link if you do n't want to be inflenced ) : https://i.imgur.com/gjjxm6b.png . 
  it does n't follow the theme color convention i mention above ( mostly because it predates the choice of colors by a decade ) . 
  i was also young and using any cool font that came my way . 
  i still like the seprentine font though ( although it does look dated now ) . 
  note that the date on that file is december 5 , 1997 , so it 's going to suck big time ,

  i need about 20 minutes to go to work by car . 
  i need more than 1 hour by public transport . 
  even in the past , when my work and my home were both on other addresses , i needed about 1 hour to get to work ( rush hour ) by car , but about 20 minutes to get back via car ( and still 1 hour to get back via public transport ) . 
  furthermore , i like driving . 
  i miss reading on the bus/metro/whatever though . 
  it 's not diesel ( that would be sacrilege ) , but it supposedly emits so little co2 ( i think 132 g/100km or something ) that it 's allowed to enter the city center at all times , as if it was some kind of hybrid or something . 
  with the dna switch ( aka : the go fast switch ) , i 'm 100 % certain that alfa romeo/fiat has lied through its teeth to get such low numbers , especially since with the turbo and all i 'm getting consumption numbers in the 10-11 lt/100 km range . 
  still , i would also be lying through my teeth if i implied i bought her because of her low consumption or environmental friendliness ,

   yeah , he 's a moderator of a subreddit so saying he 's not is incorrect . 
  he 's effectively correct . 
  it 's like having 0,01 $ and saying you have money . 
  you do n't ; you ca n't buy anything with that . 
   and look at other comments other than mine about his permaban policies . 
  in order to have `` policies '' you would need to actively mod a subreddit with more than 50 subscribers and 100 submissions . 
  a subreddit of ~ 50 subscribers . 
  does n't really count , does it ? 
  silly americans with your tips !, 
  you do n't have to tip over here , the price of the tips is already included in the price . 
  you only tip if your server does a really good job . 
  that being said , i 'd take one scarlet johansson , if you can spare one . 
  welcome to our world . 
  where we * constantly * vote for the least worse candidate . 
  she was from arcadia ( which is in the peloponnese ) . 
  she also was a bear . 
  as are arcadians ( that 's what the name means ) . 
  this submission has been removed . 
  you need to provide a lot more context . 
  i understand what this is , but i do n't think anybody outside greece does . 
  a title you could have used :  hungarian hole in the schengen fence [ follow-up from politico to last week 's hungarian residency advertisment ] you may still use that title ( or something similar ) and resubmit .
