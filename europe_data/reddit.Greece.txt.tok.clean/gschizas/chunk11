  which part ? 
  there are other ways to pay for a public good than to shut down half the tv channels . 
  a standard fee of $ 30m would do the same job , and there would n't be any controversy over which channels shut down and which do n't . 
  furthermore , the $ 30m could be made repeatable . 
  furthermore , it 's a public good that has no meaning ( not enough scarcity ) in 2016 , what with iptv and digital terrestrial signal . 
  some more info : one channel that secured a license in the auction was [ skai ] ( https://www.skai.gr ) which is opposing the government , and one of those that did n't ( and are supposed to shut down ) is [ alpha ] ( http://www.alphatv.gr ) which , for several years , hosted a [ stand-up comedy show ] ( http://www.altsantiri.gr/ ) that was almost openly supporting the government ( it still is , but less so now ) . 
  note : skai 's name is weird - it means `` sky '' transliterated into greek and back into english - for reasons beyond my comprehension . 
  please use a proper title . 
  i 'm guessing you used this by mistake . 
  seafood with `` no blood '' is allowed ( i.e. 
  octopus , mussels , oysters , calamari , snails etc. ) . 
  oil is allowed , except on wednesdays and fridays . 
  fish are n't allowed ( because they have blood ) . 
  it is indeed 49 days ( ash monday to holy saturday ) , but when you return from church in h.s. 
  after the resurrection service , you get an entrails soup ( it 's much tastier than what it sounds like ) , and on easter sunday you usually eat a whole lamb , spit roasted . 
  germans are mostly protestant , i think . 
  still , it sounds the most modern and substantial . 
  who said it 's `` no food at all '' ? 
  it 's `` no meat and dairies '' for 49 days ( the 40 days is a lie ! ) . 
  the giving up luxuries etc. 
  is correct , yes . 
  afaik , lent is 49 days , so it 's less than two months . 
  i do n't know if it 's true for other flavors of christianity than greek orthodox though . 
  i never heard them called like that . 
  til . 
  well , there are two ways to look at it . 
  it 's the way to opt-in to the ( 3rd party ) cookies . 
  but it 's not opt-in to opt-in . 
  if you mean `` are these the defaults '' , then no . 
  but this is the opt-in setting . 
  there is no `` narrative '' at play here . 
  whatever trump ( or clinton , or sanders , or whoever ) is saying , is just for internal ( us ) consumption , on account of the upcoming us elections . 
  if any of those were president , it would be a different case . 
  as things are now , covering trump and therefore us elections in / r/europe is simply off topic . 
  you already have our answer . 
  so , how is indonesia different than a modern liberal democracy ? 
  actually , it was somewhat civil :  ** dml1993 ** : also , very cool [ ironic ] , whoever disagrees with you is sprayed [ difficult to explain , conspiracy theorist ] . 
  bravo . 
   ** fuchsiamaater ** : did i use the word `` sprayed '' ? 
  the conversation on the eu in england is all over the place , that 's a simple fact , and you do n't have to believe in conspiracy theories to just be wrong , much less on what another country would vote . 
   as to polls in greece , you might be right , i wo n't argue with this . 
  in any case , it 's wrong to blindly believe in polls in any country , because as reliable as they can be , people change minds easily . 
  personally , what i see around me is exactly the state that reflects on the table i linked - that is , greeks are very disappointed with the eu , very disappointed with the eurozone , but regardless , they understand that exiting the eu at this time would be catastrophic . 
  yes , he is . 
  among other food , of course, 
   * rolls royce  * jaguar  * land rover  * aston martin  * bentley all of these are english in name only . 
   * nissan  * vauxhall [ or , as the world knows it , opel ]  * honda really ? 
  these are n't english even in name . 
  the factories can be `` relocated '' , by which i mean production will probably be reduced in england and increased in other countries ( nissan also has factories in spain , opel in ireland , honda in belgium , france and italy ) . 
   shell headquarters in netherlands , multinational really . 
   glenfiddich scottish , really , but tbh , the only whisky i 've ever enjoyed ,

  damn , that 's a stupid way to use the shower . 
  do n't `` assemble '' the shower head . 
  you are supposed to hold it and direct it on your body . 
  really , the us way of showering is plain silly : instead of directing the water where you want it to go , you just position your body underneath the shower and move around for the water to wash you all over ? 
  and hope you have a shower head wide and strong enough ? 
  that 's more than silly , it 's wasteful . 
  just hold the shower head with one hand and direct it .

  simple answer : they did n't ask . 
  we have the rest of the list in the map . 
  is so difficult to understand that certain countries ( turkey and russia are among them ) belong to * two * continents ? 
  re : eurovision : whoosh . 
  as i said , only in istanbul there are ~ 9 million people who are 100 % on european soil . 
  that 's reason enough . 
  if you saw the actual map , you would see that turkey ( and / r/turkey ) is specifically mentioned in there . 
  so it 's nothing new . 
  so , there are only two reasons you might be asking nonsense : 1 . 
  you 're new to / r/europe ( highly unlikely ) 2 . 
  you 're trolling i gave you the benefit of the doubt and assumed the first . 
  i already knew the second case was true , you just confirmed it .
