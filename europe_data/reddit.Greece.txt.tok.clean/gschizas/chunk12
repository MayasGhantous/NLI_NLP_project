   i also do n't see sub-specific css . 
  not interested . 
  thank you for letting us know . 
  we do n't care , but thanks anyway . 
  it 's not an external image . 
  furthermore : * istanbul does n't belong to greece . 
  * it has in fact , has a population larger than a lot of countries ( certainly larger than greece ) . 
  * even if you discount the asian part , it 's still larger than a lot of countries ( about 9 million residents ) . 
  * finally , turkey competes in eurovision . 
  check the map on the right . 
  you should try linking to the actual page where you got that information , all we can see is the homepage of die welt . 
  from the document , page 38 :  fiche   explanation  fiche is a useful word , but it is french . 
  its only use in english is to indicate the ( somewhat outdated ) microfiche . 
    example  ` where other information contained in the product information fiche is also provided , it shall be in the form and order specified in annex iii88 . '   alternatives  sheet , document , record , entry . 
  i had done that in my old ibiza , and it did break very hard . 
  i dare not do it in my giulietta , because italian brakes are made of the same material as thor 's hammer . 
  happy birthday ,

   i think he definitely should not have used his moderator badge to argue like that for the quality of a source , though . 
  this was an very valid use of a moderator `` badge '' . 
  he was explaining why those domains are banned from / r/europe .

  the standard form of the meme is `` pay denbts '' . 
  more info : / r/outoftheloop/comments / 2zu0za / based on [ this polandball ] ( https://i.imgur.com/eornlvv.png ) . 
  edit : there are probably earlier manifestations of the `` pay denbts '' meme . 
  that 's the one i found . 
  there is no reference anywhere to `` serious shitposts '' . 
  it 's a contradiction in terms . 
  shitposts will be removed . 
  serious posts are still allowed . 
   denbts ftfy when you 're memeing , at least meme well . 
  and yet , look at who 's president now . 
  ukraine is a european country ; sevastopol is a city , but it 's a `` city with special status '' ( together with kiev ) . 
  for the purposes of flairs ( and of course , the definite source , iso-3166 ) , sevastopol is allowed . 
  regarding hong kong ( and also macau and taiwan ) , the situation is much more ... messy . 
  * hong kong has a iso-3166 code of its own , but it 's a special administrative region of china . 
  * taiwan is the schr\u00f6dinger 's cat of states : it 's both a province of chine ( prc ) and a sovereign state of its own ( roc ) . 
  roc is not currently recognized as a separate state by almost anybody ( only vatican city recognizes it from europe , iirc ) , but it until 1971 it was considered as the `` true china '' ( and was recognized by just about everyone ) . 
  and there 's another whole shelf of worm cans waiting to be opened . 
  * macau is the mildest of them . 
  it does have a separate iso-3166 code , but it 's not generally regarded as a sovereign state ( not even from the macanese ) . 
  well ... technically hong kong is not a sovereign country , it 's a first level administrative division of china , and we only give out flags for european first level administrative divisions .

   ok buddy , here ya go . 
  show me where the right to self-determination is in the udhr . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-determination  the right of peoples to self-determination is a cardinal principle in modern international law , binding , as such , on the united nations as authoritative interpretation of the charter 's norms . 
  nice misdirection though . 
  edit : http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-i/index.html  the purposes of the united nations are :  2 \\ . 
  to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and ** self-determination of peoples ** , and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace ;, 
  as an exception to our general rule , we have approved your link .

  something about 3 million illegal votes . 
  no worries , we do n't generally allow bots ( unless they are * very * useful ) , so it was a good call . 
  and you were n't the only one to alert us about this . 
  there was only one instance in / r/europe , but it is definitely a bot . 
  out of its 241 comments , about 95 % is the same text as above . 
  it has been banned from / r/europe , obviously .

   che che che it 's because of the way they talk . 
  in mainland greece , and is `` kai '' ( pronounced roughly like ca in cake ) . 
  in rodos it 's pronounced `` che '' ( as in che guevara , obviously ) .
