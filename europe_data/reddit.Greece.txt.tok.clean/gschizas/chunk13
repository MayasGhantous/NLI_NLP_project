  it originally comes from greek , and it means something like `` untouchable '' athinganos -  tsinganos -  cigan,

  this has been removed because it 's a text post . 
  just do a normal link post and provide the translation in the comments . 
  btw , the phrase `` do n't kill the messenger '' is international, 
  that 's a problem of your phone ( or the official reddit app ) , really . 
  the site has nothing really special . 
  just open the link in your web browser . 
   but the tools and links will all be english reddit has been locali ( sz ) ed for ages . 
  even res is starting to be locali ( zs ) ed now . 
  you are n't seeing the full picture . 
  https://i.imgur.com/94sfpox.png there are a lot of translation that are currently missing , but the i18n project has been frozen ( i 'm not entirely sure why , probably because of lack of time from the admins ) .

  on a pizza ? 
  gyros belongs in a pita . 
  gyros , of course !, 
  kebab is way too greasy . 
  i do n't think it did . 
  try refreshing the page . 
  short version : 1 . 
  get a heroku account ( free ) 2 . 
  open https://github.com/gschizas/questionnaire-for-reddit/ ( fork it if you want ) . 
  click on the deploy to heroku button 4 . 
  make a questionnaire wiki page there are some instructions on the site , if they 're not enough , i 'm here to answer any questions . 
  diesel passenger cars were completely banned from athens until a few years ago , so the window was small anyway . 
  edit : also , you would n't want to drive your car in athens . 
  it may not be london-like easy to get lost , but our drivers are much more aggressive , we have way more motorcycles and many of them ( both car and motorcycle riders ) treat traffic rules as `` suggestions '' . 
  i 'm not sure if it aligns correctly , but it would be the equivalent of londoners calling scousers ( people from liverpool , for non-brits ) `` not true englishmen '', 
  i agree with that sentiment !, 
  the article states ( at the end ) :  a version of this was first published in may 2015 i misread that , and figured that this was the actual publication date ( and the date above was just the current date ) . 
  the post 's state has been restored , with my apologies .

  sorry for the correction , but it 's `` no * holds * barred '' , ( not '' * holes * '' ) , and it refers to wrestling holds . 
  i feel i 've reasonably explained myself . 
  i do n't care to carry on debating minutia of legal terms for your entertainment . 
  your definitions do not come from anywhere , and you have failed to convince me that i 've made any kind of mistake . 
  let 's agree to disagree and leave it at that . 
   you can not determine flads using iso 3166-2 you keep saying this , but it is not true . 
  flads are the ones that do n't have a parent . 
  that 's their definition . 
  second level have a first level of parent , and if there were a third level in any country 's iso , it would have second level parents . 
  regarding the `` reasoning '' , there 's no reasoning or deduction involved when the hierarchy is written on the page . 
  the page is very plainly referring to hierarchy , when it that some regions have a parent and some do n't . 
  this is not a discussion on what the iso-3166 means . 
  this is a discussion on who gets a flair . 
  and i do n't think i can get clearer than i 've been . 
  paraphrasing one of my comments about 5 miles up , i do n't intend to consult a lawyer each time i make a post on reddit . 
  i think the rule is very clear : countries of the world and regions ( flads ) of european countries . 
  flads come from iso-3166-2 , but the obvious requirement ( the `` f '' in flad ) is that the need to be first level ( so no cornwall ) . 
  the first level administrative divisions on the netherlands are the ones mentioned in the relevant wikipedia page , and the iso page . 
  aruba , cura\u00e7ao ( also isle of man , jersey ) etc. 
  are not anywhere in either page . 
  btw , i did n't use * reasoning * to get that the flads of the uk are england , scotland , wales and northern ireland . 
  it was written plainly in the page ( both pages ) . 
   you could put a regulation over it and make it self posts . 
  that wo n't help . 
  self posts do get karma ( they did n't use to , but now they do ) . 
   you gave a standard .
