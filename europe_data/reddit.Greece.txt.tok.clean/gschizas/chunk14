  cornwall met said standard . 
  you 're now applying a different standard . 
  `` it has an iso 3166 code '' is not the same as `` it has an iso 3166-2 code , but not one with a marked parent subdivision '' . 
  as i said , read the rules , laid out a year ago : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/user_flairs#wiki_what_kinds_of_flags_are_there.3f  3 \\ . 
  flags of first level divisions of european countries . 
  first level divisions of the uk are england , scotland , wales and northern ireland . 
  first level divisions of the netherlands are its provinces . 
  that 's it . 
  why are you attempting to make this more difficult than it is ? 
   no , it does n't . 
  yes , you can indeed deduce cornwall is one level below england , but you ca n't determine the level of non-parented entries as it does n't categorize levels and has no reference points for such . 
  yet it does . 
  there 's no deducing , the division hierarchy is there in black and white . 
   iso does n't categorize level of administration . 
  yet it does - by using the parent subdivision . 
  which most of the ( many ) subdivisions of iso-3166-2 : gb have , while none have it for iso-3166-2 : nl . 
  you asked for a single standard . 
  i gave you a single standard . 
  you insist that uk counties are the same as dutch divisions , but this is n't supported by the iso . 
  [ this one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_galicia ) ? 
  different flag than then one i was referring to above , and obviously a historical flag . 
  in the page you linked : sort by parent subdivision . 
  the ones without a parent subdivision ( aka first level administrative divisions ) are : category | 3166-2 code | name -- | -- | -- country | gb-eng | england province | gb-nir | northern ireland country | gb-sct | scotland country | gb-wls | wales the rest are not first level ( the `` nations '' are included for completeness ; furthermore , they are covered by the `` countries '' and they do n't have flags anyway . ) . 
  in comparison , all [ dutch ] ( https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:nl ) flads do not have any parent subdivision ; therefore they are equivalent with the uk `` countries '' / `` provinces '' . 
  [ isle of man ] ( https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:im ) , [ jersey ] ( https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:je ) , [ gibraltar ] ( https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:gi ) , as well as [ aruba ] ( https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:aw ) , [ bonaire , sint eustatius and saba ] ( https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:bq ) , [ cura\u00e7ao ] ( https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:cw ) , [ greenland ] ( https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:gl ) etc are already included either as top-level codes ( equivalent to uk , or gr , or nl , or de ) , so there 's no point lumping then under uk , nl or dk . 
  as i said , every country may name its flads whatever they like . 
  to be fair , i need to use a standard . 
  by following the iso standard , ** uk ** ( the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland ) is at the same level as ** nl ** ( the netherlands ) , which is at the same level as ** de ** ( germany ) , and ** gb-eng ** ( england ) is at the same level as ** nl-dr ** ( drenthe ) and at the same level as ** de-be ** ( berlin ) . 
  i do n't have to confuse anything . 
  i 'm using [ iso 3166 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iso_3166-2:gb ) , which specifically declares that the flads of uk are england , scotland , wales and northern ireland . 
  there 's no such thing as the `` country '' of england . 
  england is not a `` country '' , it 's a `` country '' ( small `` c '' ) ; a flad with a fancy name . 
  for the netherlands , aruba , cura\u00e7ao etc , are in the same position as the isle of man , jersey or gibraltar for the uk or greenland for denmark : they count as standalone countries anyway ( they have their own iso-3166-1 code ) . 
  so , no double standards . 
  nl-dr ( drenthe ) is in the same level as uk-sco ( scotland ) . 
  cornwal ( gb-con ) is one level below that ( under uk-wls - wales ) . 
  having standards means i can rely on decisions made by more competent people ( than me ) . 
  the flad requirement is mentioned in the rules . 
  i 'm actively trying to not be a lawyer in everything i write ( i 'm not a lawyer anyway ) , but you 're making it difficult . 
  the uk countries ( i.e. 
  scotland , england , wales and northern ireland ) are the flads of uk . 
  the flads of the netherlands are its provinces . 
   you 're basing whether a region has a flag or not on wikipedia ? 
  not actual official declarations ? 
  what , you expect me to do * research * for all regions of europe ? 
  in languages i do n't even know ? 
   that 's where you remove all but those . 
  per your own op rule 3 of being eligible of having a regional flag is `` it has an actual flag ( not a coat of arms ) '' . 
  i wo n't even touch the french regions until they 're settled down . 
  i think i made that clear . 
   i can add that all portuguese districts have coas to my knowledge . 
  the fact that they have coat of arms is indicative there 's a flag somewhere . 
  but i wo n't do research to find it . 
  if it 's in wikipedia ( therefore it probably has passed the wikipedia criteria ) , it 's in . 
   i do believe the national subdivisions should be decided on a country by country basis no . 
  that will not happen . 
  if not nothing else , for my sanity to remain , there must be simple , clear and fair rules for this . 
  i 'm not interested in debating every region of the 50 ( +6 ) european states . 
  well , they do n't now , do they ? 
  all french regions did have proper flags when i added their flairs . 
  furthermore , most of the current ( post-2016 ) french regions * do * have flags . 
  i 'm waiting to see what will happen ( i.e. 
  when somebody will edit the wikipedia page ) with the new regions that have a lot of former regions merged : here are the new french regions : code | name | status -- | -- | -- fr-ara | auvergne-rh\u00f4ne-alpes | only logo fr-bfc | bourgogne-franche-comt\u00e9 | only coat of arms fr-bre | bretagne | proper flag fr-cvl | centre-val de loire | proper flag fr-cor | corse | proper flag fr-ges | grand est | only logo fr-hdf | hauts-de-france | only logo fr-idf | \u00cele-de-france | proper flag fr-nor | normandie | proper flag fr-naq | nouvelle-aquitaine | only coat of arms fr-occ | occitanie | proper flag fr-pdl | pays de la loire | proper flag fr-pac | provence-alpes-c\u00f4te d'azur | proper flag so , out of the 13 regions , most ( 8 ) do n't even warrant a change . 
  2 of them already have coat of arms , which means that they probably have a flag as well , but nobody has bothered to upload it to wikipedia , and another 3 only have a logo , but they are even changing names as we speak ( the name `` grand est '' did n't even exist when i last checked ) . 
  i 'm not playing favorites with france . 
  if i wanted to play favorites , there are other countries ( such as my own ) that i could play favorites with . 
  it 's a simple matter of time management : i 'm not going to bother with france ( which is mostly ok anyway ) when there are countries that have no proper regional flags yet . 
  edit : to be clear , i like the argument that portugal has regions based on the capitals , and the regions do n't have flags of their own , so i could `` upscale '' the capital municipal flag as the regional flag for portugal . 
  edit 2 : to clarify : i 'm not going to bother with france , because the transition is a recent thing , and it will probably change quite a lot anyway . 
  when the situation has settled down , i 'll revisit the issue . 
  as i said , i `` m open to defining a more accommondating rule , provided that it 's simple , clear , fair and does n't allow for lawyering ( also , it does n't break the 350 user flair limit ) . 
  one more thing : if my memory servers , i made the french districts before 2016 , or at least before the relevant wikipedia page was up . 
  so , there 's no real special case for france , i 'm just waiting for the information to be available to modify the current flairs , but it 's at the bottom of my list . 
  once the new admin regions get flags , they are getting used . 
  simple as that . 
  i 'm expecting it to be a temporary situation anyway . 
  cornwall is not a first level administrative region . 
  it 's a second level admin region . 
  the fact that the uk has named its first level administrative regions `` countries '' does n't mean anything . 
  so , no cornwall does n't satisfy the `` first level administrative region '' criterion . 
  dude . 
  how much time do you think i have to implement every country and every special handling ? 
  this is not my paying job !, 
  it 's chaotic enough as it is . 
  i do n't need * more * chaos , i need * less * . 
  no , i 'm not letting my role go to my head . 
  i 'm trying to retain my sanity . 
  alternative text labels are used in / r/europe to show the user text flair selection . 
  i have n't found a way to show both an extra explanative text and the user 's chosen text . 
  that 's similar to what i have in mind for phase ii . 
  but i need to have order in phase i before i can try to implement phase ii . 
  the flag list is near unsustainable as it is ( `` easter egg '' : 4 flags are destroyed right now , because of a user error . 
  by `` easter egg '' i man it 's a bug , but it 's probably hidden . 
  by `` user '' i mean me ) . 
  i agree about the gloriously fabulous purple . 
  i 'm * expecting * her to go up in flames spontaneously anyway . 
  i 'm open to defining a clear and fair rule . 
  i do n't want it to devolve to a legal document though . 
  and it has to respect the 350 user flair limit ( at least for phase i ) . 
  you mean `` scotland ( uk ) '' ?
