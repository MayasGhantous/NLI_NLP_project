  well , all you have to do is vote for independence next time the question comes around, 
  they are n't user-selectable though . 
  there 's a bot on the other side that you message to get your flair . 
  and , while the map etc do look nice , they are n't going to work for the mobile web/apps ( which account for * more * than 50 % of reddit 's traffic ) . 
  i 'd rather reserve this for more obscure flags . 
  the [ limit of 350 flairs is hard-coded on reddit 's code ] ( https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/bd922104b971a5c6794b199f364a06fdf61359a2/r2/r2/models/flair.py#l116 ) . 
  i did n't even know it existed before we hit that limit . 
  well , i 'm sure every country thinks it should have special handling . 
  this way lies chaos , though . 
  the rules must be clear , fair and easily implementable . 
  i think that transylvania will be removed , it 's not a current 1st level division ( but i could be mistaken ) . 
  i think it 's a historical flag , that transcends several current 1st level divisions . 
  i 'll have to read up more on the falklands ( i 'm guessing yes ) . 
  crimea is recognized from most of the european countries to be part of ukraine . 
  as far as i can tell , the annexation of crimea by russia was illegal . 
  it did n't come from nowhere . 
  the [ rules have been there for more than a year ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/user_flairs ) . 
  the trigger was that ( a ) we filled the user flair maximum of reddit ( 350 ) and ( b ) i had some time to continue with the changes . 
  there have been several more changed in the past , but nobody knew anything because they were transparent ( and obviously not as controversial ) . 
  greenland is an overseas region of denmark , so it gets a flag anyway . 
  frankly , i would n't have a problem with changing the rule , with the only requirement to not expand into a full-fledged legal document ... 
   the flag of rutland should win precedence over the flag of scotland but that 's the opposite of what i 'm saying . 
  i 'm saying that scotland ( 1st level admin division ) is in , rutland ( 2nd level admin division ) is out . 
  kazakhstan should be included , it 's partially in europe ( as is russia and turkey ) . 
  vatican city is already included in our flair list . 
  azerbaijan should be included as well , but it 's very hard to find out which parts are supposed to be in europe and which in asia ( so that i can assign the regional flags ) . 
  edit : i think i 've said that the council of europe is a good starting point ( or maybe i dreamed it - i 've been overwhelmed by the response in this thread ) . 
  the coe is usually our go-to for including countries ( trans-continental one ) , not for excluding them , especially ones that are surrounded by other european ( and members of the coe ) . 
  it only does n't include belarus ( for human rights reasons ) . 
  the `` non-european '' states you refer to are , by definition , european . 
  yet it is broke . 
  we have already reached the limit of reddit 's allowance for user flairs ( 350 ) . 
  and most 1st level admin regions are n't represented . 
  as i 've said , it 's only the first level of administrative regions . 
  by that count , we are talking about the 4 `` countries '' of uk , and the 16 federal states ( bundesl\u00e4nder ) of germany . 
  the simplification refers to : * removing the duplicates * having less user flair selections , so that it 's easier to find your own flag ( with 350 flairs , it 's way too difficult ) * having unified rules for what flairs are supposed to be included . 
  as i said though , this is only phase i. 
  for phase ii , there might be changes , but while i 'm doing this manually , it 's not really feasible to expect more detail than countries + ( european ) regions . 
  ask the french government why it reduced the regions without deciding/assigning flags to them . 
  when all new regions have proper flags , i will do the migration for them as well . 
  well , i stand corrected . 
  that 's the reason i stopped doing those conversions, 
  damn , it i was reading that as `` ims lower , okay ? '', 
  ( i 'm guessing it 's `` i 'm slower , okay ? '' ), 
  that 's exactly what i did ( check my edit \u263a ), 
  yes , i totally got that  as i said , being a mod for / r/europe has widely broadened my geography knowledge - it definitely was n't my favorite subject at school . 
  the fact of course that i learned geography before the end of the cold war ( i.e. 
  with a lot less countries in europe , and at least one extra ) has n't helped any . 
  yes , i know . 
  i 'm sure i 've complained ( whined ) in the past among the mod team . 
  it 's worse than russia !, 
  frankly , having almost a third of the flair space for one country is not realistically going to happen in the near future . 
  this will probably have to wait for phase ii . 
  edit : not all of them have flags , though . 
  edit 2 : i think this was the reason i went with the [ pre-2011 / newsletter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iso_3166-2:lv#codes_before_newsletter_ii-3 ) list of regions . 
  please rehost the first to either imgur or reddit itself , everybody is getting a `` no hotlinking '' warning ( and no image ) . 
  is n't that the flag of indonesia ? 
  you 'd need to post an actual link for that . 
  well , all the other regions are going to be in the form `` country ( region ) '' though . 
  you are of course welcome to change that . 
  in your case , you do n't need to do anything , because you have already done so, 
  we want to keep the flair selection process as straightforward as possible , meaning at least for the first level ( countries ) a simple selection from the user flair list . 
  that being said , this is not our final form - we just need to do this to clean up the system ; as it is it 's only possible to add flairs/flags with a very painstaking manual way . 
  one more thing : since this is / r/europe and not / r/vexillology ( meaning that most users of / r/europe do n't know one flag from the next , especially when going by regional flags ) , we want to keep the option of having some kind of explanation for each flag ( for example , by a hover text or something ) . 
  i 'm well aware of the history of the uk , as well as the fact that you have named your first-level administrative divisions `` countries '' . 
  you should n't be expecting special treatment though . 
  the position we are taking is that the same rules apply to all . 
  that being said , if you ever vote yourselves independent , i would be happy to add the flags of glasgow , edinburgh , aberdeen , dundee and all the 32 ( ? ), 
  regions of scotland, 
  there are only 20 redditors that have selected that flag anyway . 
  everybody can ask for special treatment . 
  the line has to be drawn somewhere though . 
  countries and 1st level admin regions seems the best place to draw the line to satisfy the most redditors ( only 32 redditors have chosen the sami flair , btw ) . 
  well , the rules need to apply equally to all . 
  it would be an injustice to every other region to keep the sami flag . 
  the [ lisbon district ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lisbon_district ) does n't seem to have an official flag . 
  this one is already removed . 
  the earth flag is not really a flag . 
  it bothers me vexillologically !, 
  that being said , we need all the living room we can get !, 
  and every flag counts . 
  i would n't be very opposed to having a un flag , but un does n't represent * all * countries . 
  there is no official earth flag ( [ there are a lot of unofficial ones , of course ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_earth ) ) , so i do n't see a way that the earth flag can be kept . 
  that 's a good question . 
  i suppose it should ( it does have a flag , it even has its own iso-3166 code ) , even if there 's only 20 redditors that have chosen that flair . 
  edit : as i said , it 's not easy to try to generate order out of chaos . 
  hence my appreciation for european `` beaurocrats '', 
  you can of course change the flair text ( as you already have ) . 
  edit : the old flag for galicia was for the [ republic of galicia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_galicia ) , which reportedly lasted only a few hours !, 
  yes , bavaria is covered . 
  the fact that bavaria has two flags makes this more ... interesting , but i think it 's best to keep the more distinctive one ( the one you have , instead of the plain striped one ) . 
  they do n't . 
  the official flag for all of them is the tricolor . 
  unless you can get a better source than wikipedia . 
  dude , chill . 
  every time i look at the list of regions of russia , i get cold sweats . 
  i fully intend to add russian 1st level regions , but i do n't intend to die doing it !, 
  please appreciate the actual work i have to do for this . 
  it 's not a single click option , it 's a lot of work to extract all flags , shrink them down to 16x11 size , curse ( myself ) for mangling a beautiful flag , attempt to make some changes , fail , go back to simple resizing , add to the list of flags , make the css changes and add the actual flairs . 
  do n't ask me , ask the french government .
