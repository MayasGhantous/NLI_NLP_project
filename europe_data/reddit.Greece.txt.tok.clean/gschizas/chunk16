  well , none of the [ overseas departments ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iso_3166-2:fr#overseas_departments ) has a flag ( except maybe [ mayotte ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mayotte ) , but that barely counts as a flag , and it 's [ unofficial ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_and_coat_of_arms_of_mayotte ) anyway ) , so they wo n't be included . 
  as i replied [ elsewhere ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6mkjzb/user_flair_flags_reorganization/dk2bved/ ) :  let me note here that since the post-2016 1st level administrative divisions do not have flags ( some of them only have some horrible logos ) , especially for france we are sticking with the pre-2016 divisions . 
  do we currently have french overseas territories ? 
  this modding business has certainly stretched my geography skills past their breaking point !, 
  i 've already got an earful from catalans  edit : demonym correction . 
  basque country ( france ) is part of aquitaine ( pre-2016 ) or nouvelle-aquitaine ( post-2016 ) . 
  let me note here that since the post-2016 1st level administrative divisions do not have flags ( some of them only have some horrible logos ) , especially for france we are sticking with the pre-2016 divisions . 
  i 'm afraid amsterdam does n't even appear on the [ relevant iso 3166 list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iso_3166-2:nl ) . 
  russia is a major project ... 
  it has way too many 1st level regional divisions , some of which are in asia ( so they should n't be added ) . 
  i hope i do have enough spaces to fit the russian flags , but it may have to wait for phase ii of the reorg project ( where regional flags will probably be assigned by a bot instead of being user-selectable by the limiting reddit flair selection system ), 
  this was the reason for the reorg , so , yes ( but give me time ) . 
  yes , i 'm not just using eu here , i 'm going for the whole of europe . 
  i 'm also removing the `` shine '' effect on some of the flags , which is really distorting the actual flag colors . 
  the german flag was one of those flags which was changed to remove that `` shine '' effect , so you 're seeing the true colors of it , which are much better and more vivid than what we had before . 
  yes , since there was some complaints ( understandable ) , i thought to lay out the plan . 
  i 'll have to do the count , but i think that palestine is recognized by less than 50 % of the european countries ( but it 's very close ) . 
  edit : i 'm counting 17 european countries . 
  i might be counting wrong though . 
  edit 2 : i 'm also counting 22 european countries that do n't recognize palestine , so it 's most likely going to be removed . 
  there is no `` eu '' flair , there 's a `` europe '' flair . 
  the [ flag of 12 golden stars on a blue background is the flag of europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_europe ) , created in 1955 , and only * adopted * by the european union ( actually the european economic community at the time ) in 1985 . 
  have you read the [ faq about user flairs ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/user_flairs ) ? 
  it 's stated quite clearly there . 
  so , no , the european flag is not going to be removed . 
  scotland * is * a uk region , and this will be reflected on the default flair text . 
  spatharios is a male name ( not a very common one , btw ) , so i 'm sure the ones that gave him that name have looked under his tail, 
  my own cat has the same colors , and he 's definitely a he . 
  edit : he even had a sister with the exact same colors ( and it was definitely a sister ) . 
   and now , what 's going to happen to us without barbarians ? 
   they were , those people , a kind of solution .

  it 's not visible to anyone but you and the moderators at this moment . 
  please do n't use url shortening services such as goo.gl . 
  they are unnecessary for reddit . 
  just type your link in markdown , like so : ` [ noble guard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/noble_guard_ ( vatican \\ ) ) ` ( note the ` \\ ) ` that fixes the problem with the closing parenthesis . ), 
  this will result in this : [ noble guard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/noble_guard_ ( vatican \\ ) ) .

  it 's like eating spider 's web !, 
  actually , george is the most common male name in greece .

  do n't worry about it , i 've seen one of the founders of reddit mess it up once !, 
  my mnemonic rule : [ ] is a signpost , ( ) is the explanation : ` [ i want to say something important ] ( which is written here ) `, 
  i ca n't help being reminded of the ** hal ** l ** o ** wed xbox tradition of teabagging, 
  you have your parentheses and brackets swapped around : ` [ text goes here ] ( link goes here ) `, 
  i think you mean `` hovering over the balls '' . 
  which sounds dirty in and of itself, 
  it 's possible . 
  when writing an am rule , you can specify if it applies to submissions , comments or both ( not 100 % sure where text posts/self posts come in on this ), 
  either put two spaces at the end of each line , or a star ( '' * '' ) at the start of each line .

   surprise reddit is like 55 % usa actually , latest numbers i recall said 45 % usa , not 55 % . 
   but in government , alexis tsipras , prime minister , must tread carefully . 
  his coalition partner , the small rightwing independent greeks , or anel , is fiercely nationalist . 
  anel are in a very precarious position right now .
