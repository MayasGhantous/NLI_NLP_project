  yes , they are fiercely nationalist , but if they choose to overthrow the government now , they wo n't get reelected in the following snap elections ( they poll under 2 % , when a minimum of 3 % is required for entering the parliament ) . 
  therefore , they are more likely a toothless lion by now ( not that they * ever * were a lion , in absolute terms , but they are extra toothless now ) . 
   swapping i sincerely hope you meant swatting . 
  just to add one more thing : cyprus ( apart from being part of the council of europe and the european union ) is also classified * geographically * to be a part of europe ( in addition to being a part of west asia or the middle east ) . 
  we have explained exactly why this is off-topic . 
  therefore you already have your answer . 
  there 's no point on continuing this discussion . 
  well , you said air ** planes ** . 
  when he was 8 years old . 
  tv would n't be invented for another 30 years ( by philo farnsworth ) . 
  radio was n't even broadcast at the time - marconi had just created his radio 1 year earlier ( 1896 ) . 
  hitler was 8 years old at that time , so no . 
  well , given that the first airplane would n't exist for another 6 years ( 1903 vs 1897 ) , that would be top post in all of reddit . 
  i have answered your questions in elsewhere in this thread . 
  forgive me if i 'm repeating myself . 
  * `` making headlines '' does n't make it of `` national significance '' . 
  battles in the syrian border also make headlines , but they are n't on-topic for / r/europe . 
  * the fact that turkey is a member of coe ( and the fact that it has more people in the european part than several european states ) is the reason that news that are of national significance are considered on-topic . 
  * armenia was part of the european part of ussr . 
  it is also part of coe . 
  * cyprus is also ( geographically ) considered part of europe as well ( not just part of western asia - and i 've never heard it considered to be part of the middle east , which is mostly a political designation than a geographical one ) . 
  again , `` made national headlines '' does n't make it of `` national significance '' . 
  battles on the syrian border also `` make it '' to `` national headlines '' , but that does n't make them on-topic for / r/europe . 
  regarding the fact that turkey has territory ( and people , more than some european states ) in europe , this is exactly the reason that news of national significance are considered on-topic for / r/europe . 
  yes , of course turkey is a member of coe . 
  and it also has more people in the european part ( even just including the european part of istanbul ) than a lot of european states . 
  that 's why news pertaining to the european part of turkey ( rare ) or news of national significance are considered on-topic . 
  sometimes i wish we did have an agenda , it would be much easier that way . 
  unfortunately , we do n't . 
  your opinion is noted , but ultimately it fails to satisfy the criteria to be considered on-topic for / r/europe . 
  it 's not a terrorist attack , it 's a local crime committed ( allegedly ) by a terrorist organization , and most importantly , it was committed in the most eastern part of turkey , furthermore , regarding geography : * absolutely no part of greece is outside europe ( this would be an oxymoron , since europe was originally defined by greece anyway ) * cyprus is a part of both the council of europe and the european union , and of course it has always been culturally european ( dating back to ancient times ) . 
  regarding `` making national headlines '' : this is not a criterion at all . 
  having national significance does n't mean `` making national headlines '' . 
   are the things that happen in the asian part of russia irrelevant ? 
  yes . 
  no that much happens in the asian part of russia anyway . 
   entire cyprus and armenia are irrelevant then . 
  cyprus is part of the eu and the council of europe , so no . 
  regarding armenia , it * was * part of the european part of ussr , and is currently also a member of the council of europe , so this is a very strong indication that it * is * relevant . 
  but we hardly get any armenian news anyway . 
   [ bing maps link removed ] i 'm surprised google maps link passed - it should n't . 
  edit : unless we 've put providence for only maps links .

  nobody comments on her use of `` cyberspace '' ? 
  is it still the '80s ? 
  of course steganography ( through its process ) takes up bandwidth . 
  so it 's not going to be used when not under a totalitarian regime . 
  what 's your point ? 
  i 'm saying it 's mathematically impossible to ban cryptography . 
  so , terrorists ( who obviously care more about getting the message across than uploading their last night 's pub crawl to facebook quickly ) will ** always ** be able to encrypt their communications . 
  of course actual terrorists , and not the kinds that scaremongering invents , do n't even use the internet , but that only deepens the pit may has dug herself into . 
  that 's a simple proof of concept , that i could do by hand . 
  read up on steganography . 
  it is trivial to implement secure messaging through uploads to reddit/imgur/facebook / whatever images . 
  and it is mathematically impossible to detect . 
  well , i just did . 
  read my message again . 
  no worries . 
  i love your quote :  if you try to stop people from doing something , some people will dedicate their lives to do it . 
  no , i was agreeing with you !, 
  i was adding to what you said !, 
  this is literally the argument `` if guns are outlawed , only outlaws will have guns '' . 
  if only the terrorists have encryption , who has won in the end ? 
  edit : assume that the terrorists have undetectable encryption , because they will . 
  anyway , you do n't need to make any kind of `` system '' . 
  i 'm sure there is already software that do this automatically . 
  as i 'm also sure they can be made to work through tor . 
  one of the most impactful images i 've seen on reddit was a picture of a graffiti on a turkish wall , that explained the address of google 's public dns ( 8.8.8.8 ) in order to go through the turkish block of twitter ( at the time ) . 
  in the end , do you really want your everyman eventually knowing about ways to work `` illegaly '' just to do their work ? 
  do you really want have the uk drop down to erdogan 's turkey levels ? 
   of course , if it 's encrypted and on the wire then your isp can block it . 
  nope . 
  if it 's encrypted , the isp ca n't detect it 's encrypted . 
  i can literally put messages inside the jpeg noise , and no progra * m * can detect if there 's a mess * a * ge there or not . 
  i can even hide messages inside the whitespaces and t * y * pos of a reddit message . 
  please , look up what * s * teganography is . 
  yo * u * r con * c * eption and * k * nowledge encryption i * s * wrong . 
  well , cory doctorow is n't that random . 
  sure , he 's no bruce schneier , but this is n't `` just a random guy '' . 
   does n't matter if you ca n't inspect the content of a packet , you can see that it 's encrypted , and block it . 
  no you ca n't . 
  learn about steganography . 
  you can pass any encrypted data e.g. 
  inside the least significant bit of an image . 
  it 's completely undetectable , unless you already have the key beforehand . 
   they can block encrypted traffic . 
  the only way to do that is block the whole internet . 
  there is no other way .
