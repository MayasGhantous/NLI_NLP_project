  if it 's on the wire , it can be encrypted . 
  and it can be undetectable . 
  in fact , even if they did block the whole internet , it would still be possible to get encrypted data . 
  and i 'm not even touching dial-up here . 
  your argument turns back to a pumpkin once you sneeze though . 
  you do n't appear to be reading my comments either , and you seem more focused on throwing buzzwords to me , as if i would be intimidated by them . 
  nothing gained , nothing lost . 
  goodbye . 
   so you literally did not read my original point at all , as i clearly preface the entire argument with the definitions of the relevant terms , specifically that what biology recognizes as `` morphological change '' is what we call a `` race '' among humans . 
  as i said , it is n't . 
  read up on what `` race '' is , in the context of biology . 
   specific definition is as i recall , `` subspecies '' . 
  this is doubly wrong . 
  not only subspecies is a different thing than race ( race is under subspecies ) , humans definitely do n't have subspecies - that 's late 1800s/early 1900s `` slavery is ok '' biology . 
   not only do you now show that you do not know what you 're talking about , you even show that you did n't even read the arguments presented . 
  or maybe it 's the other way around . 
  in order to have a race , you need to have phenotypically ** distinct ** populations . 
  what i 'm saying ( and you 're ignoring ) is that humans do n't have phenotypically distinct populations . 
  the phenotype distribution in human populations follows geographical gradients ( clines ) and there are no lines that separate ( phenotypically ) one population from the next . 
  in order to have subspecies , you need to additionally have some geographical ( or other ) isolation , something that historically has never really happened for _ homo sapiens _ anyway ( not for a biologically significant time , at least ) . 
  look up what `` race '' is in the context of biology . 
  it 's not what you think . 
    why are you so desperate to mark me a religious man ? 
    you do that just fine on your own you might as well be accusing me i 'm purple-skinned . 
  it 's so far off the mark , it 's in a different country . 
   racial traits are morphological , not genetic . 
  most of the morphological traits you refer to are gradually changing from any one place to any other place , without any `` steps '' that could define any race . 
  it 's population genetics . 
   genetics are also just a field of biological research , and not a religion , and therefore are not capitalized . 
  i capitalized genetics to mean that it 's the science , not the specific genetics . 
  why are you so desperate to mark me a religious man ? 
  what biology denialism ? 
  i 'm telling you exactly what biology says about humans !, 
  i 'm coming at this exactly from the position of science . 
  attempting to label me unscientific is probably the most ridiculous ( well , ok , it 's probably on the top 10 though ) i 've been labeled !, 
  the whole concept of dividing humans into races is something that was advocated in the beginning of last century , and it has been since disproven by genetics . 
  the point is that going for example from south africa to norway , there is n't any clearly defined line where you could say `` people south of here are race a , people north of here are race b '' . 
  the reality is that the variation in phenotypes is very gradual and follows the geography , with no distinct steps . 
  please look it up , your knowledge seems out of date . 
  no , it does n't .

  this * is * toolbox , yes . 
  the * customization * of toolbox notes was crystallized recently . 
  have you stopped beating your wife ? 
  that 's actually a logical fallacy . 
  we produce a lot of marble . 
  it 's cheaper over here ( not cheap , just cheaper ) . 
  tbh i seriously doubt it will take another 60 years . 
  2017 is n't 1973 ( or 1961 ) . 
  the world it 's much smaller now , and things are moving way faster . 
  but if the uk were to rejoin eu , it would do so without the exceptional status it got back in 1973 . 
  i would be expecting the euro , full metric , i would n't even be surprised if it got forced to drive on the right ( highly unlikely though ) . 
  the standard assumption for a generation is about 30 years ( the number i 've seen most often is 33 years , so that 1 century = 3 generations ) . 
  i get your point though . 
   \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac\u03c2 spell check pls, 
   generations you 're overblowing this a bit . 
  it 's barely one generation since the uk _ joined _ the eu ( 1973 ) . 
  it 's barely two generations since the eu ( eec at the time ) was formed even ( 1957 ) !, 
  well , the point is that they 're not as clustered as you 'd expect . 
  in fact there are definite `` smooth '' clines from one population to the next . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  i certainly am not denying biology . 
  there are differences , of course between people , but , according to biology the science , there is no such thing as races for * humans * . 
  race is n't an empty word , it actually means something . 
  the fact that race does n't exist as a biological concept for _ homo sapiens _ might also be part of the picture . 
  ( `` race '' is a social construct , which does n't correspond to anything in biology - humans ca n't be categorized in races mostly because any morphological characteristics change too `` smoothly '' from one place to the next ) . 
  he 's a very successful architect , but that 's beside the point , really . 
  that 's not what / u/kraahn was saying . 
  acknoledging that the spouse of the prime minister is gay , means that ( obviously ) the pm is gay , so hiding that fact would be hiding that sucessful gay people ( such as the pm of luxembourg ) exist . 
  you know that the [ guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/xavier_bettel#personal_life ) he married ( who is prime minister of luxembourg ) is also gay , yes ? 
  i did n't speak about the attack at all . 
  syriza and our current pm are left wing , there 's no question about it . 
  the way they can run the country is the way any left-wing government can run the country . 
  claiming `` oh , they 're not really left-wing , we need a true left-wing government '' is the definition of the [ no true scotsman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/no_true_scotsman ) logical fallacy . 
  yes , it has n't happened for 2 years because most of the members of the neo-nazi party are on trial for past murders and for leading a criminal organization , so they 're holding off for now . 
  well , terrorists are n't a new development in greece . 
  let me introduce you the the `` no true scotsman '' fallacy .

  the way you organize your code in javascript and lua is night and day compared to java and go . 
  furthermore the fact that go produces compiled real machine code , makes it different from all three . 
  being able to pick up different languages does n't make them `` flavours '' !, 
  the title of the submission should be in english , not italian ; and it should be a translation of the original title . 
  there was no translation provided in the comments . 
  well , i hope you * do * realize that javascript and java are two vastly different languages . 
  calling `` javascript '' a `` flavour '' of java is a faux pax of the highest degree .
