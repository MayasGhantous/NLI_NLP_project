  go has nothing to do with java either ( certainly not a flavour of java ) , and lua has n't even the same genealogy ( it does n't even derive from c , i.e. 
  it does n't use braces , as do the others ), 
   remove the eu flair for the banner . 
  for the umpteenth time : it is the flag of europe , not the flag of eu . 
  eu ( eec actually ) adopted that flag 30 years after it was created .

  translations :  [ ... ]  personally , i do n't like the costume , what gives ? 
  must we like everything ? 
   do you know anything about geography ? 
  south albania and northern epirus are the same thing . 
   [ ... ]  the fact that i have some beliefs with which you disagree with does n't make you more greek . 
  when you have real proof , come and say what you want to me . 
  translation for any ( non-greek ) that 's reading this :  it 's funny you mentiona small part of my comments about greece but you do n't mention all the other times i spoke positevly about greece . 
  you have a specific agenda by which everybody that disagrees with you is not greek . 
  and you are you to say i 'm not greek ? 
   yes , greeks caused the crisis . 
  admit it and drop the bullshit . 
  whoever greek says we did n't cause the crisis is n't greek ? 
   i never said north epirotes are albanians . 
  why are you stalking my profile ? 
   and drop the crap about trolling , exactly what have i accused greece for ? 
  when did i tried to diminish greece ?

   bakemoji you mean [ mojibake ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mojibake )   so then , there is basically no use of semicolons on greek right now ? 
  it is used , in the way that it is taught and everything , but very few people know how to write one on the computer keyboard . 
  i think it 's possible on a mac , but on windows and linux it 's very hard . 
  so , because of some wrong decisions from the part of some developers , our language is slowly losing a punctuation mark . 
  edit : it seems that dropping the `` upper dot '' predates computers . 
  [ even in a polytonic ( pre-1982 ) mechanical typewriter ] ( http://www.ough.gr/uploads/galleries/grafomixanes/grafomixanes.jpg ) there are no upper dot keys !, 
  of course in mechanical typewriters you could do a half line field , type a regular dot , and climb back down . 
  still , `` upper dots '' have been shunned by technology in greece  edit 2 : note that there is no 1 or 0 in this typewriter , as they could be simulated by the capital i ( i ) and capital o ( o ) . 
  also , the latin characters are considered symbols , and there are at least 5 accent dead keys . 
  oh , i was n't clear !, 
  the real greek characters ( u +0387 and u +037 e ) are n't used at all !, 
  we use the semicolon as the question mark and there is n't a way to use the `` semicolon '' ( our middle dot ) in any way , neither by u +387 nor by keyboard . 
  so , the few people that remember that there 's such a thing as a `` upper period '' or `` half dot '' or whatever ( `` ano teleia '' = literallly `` upper dot '' ) , resort to keyboard hacks ( the most common is ` alt +0183 ` , which indeed comes out with \u00b7 ( the middle dot you have on shift +3 ) . 
  this all goes back to how the `` ansi '' codepages were implemented , but i think i 've already bored you enough , 
  interesting ... 
  i was using the wrong middle dot . 
  the greek `` ano teleia '' is ` \u0387 ` , u +0387 , which is almost impossible to write . 
  the middle dot that is used in catalan is ` \u00b7 ` , u +00 b7 . 
  side by side : ` \u0387 \u00b7 ` ( or \u0387 \u00b7 in the standard reddit font ) . 
  that being said , the greek question mark is ` \u037e ` ( u +37 e ) , but i 've never seen any keyboard or os use anything else for the greek question mark other than ` ; ` ( u +003 b ) . 
  ( those side-by-side : ` \u037e ; ` - they are exactly the same ) . 
  huh . 
  til and all that . 
  it seems there are spaces next to the quotation marks as well ``` like this ''` . 
  edit : i 'm not complaining . 
  in greek the question mark is ` ; ` , which is very hard to tell apart from ` : ` , and the semicolon is ` \u00b7 ` which does n't exist on any keyboard ( greek included ) . 
  is there one in french ?

  nope , it 's from turkish ( and then from persian ) . 
  pust means quite literally `` ass '' . 
  you posted an image with no source , that could be from anywhere .
