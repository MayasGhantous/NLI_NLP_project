  i believe that 's the real test . 
  wikipedia supports that english is not a state language . 
  i 'm guessing laws ( and the constitution ) are written in greek and turkish , not english . 
  which language are official documents written in ? 
  and in what order ? 
  english is still a state language ( together with greek and turkish ) . 
  well , puns do n't translate all that well , do they ? 
  i knew about that ( i learned it on reddit , in fact ) , but it never feels right ... and the person i was replying to had already used `` he ''  i also have to state here that your username is n't a true polish name . 
  it is severely lacking in the `` z '' quota  it makes up in consequent consonants at least  i 've had to actually implement polish grammar for a project at work , some year ago , and polish grammar has left a permanent mark on my soul , 
  well , it 's highly likely your comments or posts will get caught up in the spam filters . 
  moderators do not make the spam filter , btw , the spam filter exists for the whole reddit . 
  before writing the second comment , he ( ? ), 
  had n't changed his link . 
  in any case , i 'm not badgering him about it , i 'm just explaining and offering a better alternative . 
  url shorteners are specifically mentioned in the reddiquette and , more to the point , are caught by the spam filter . 
  if you want to make your links look better , why not use reddit 's markdown syntax ? 
  for example ` [ a random link ] ( http://www.xkcd.com/ ) ` will give you [ a random link ] ( http://www.xkcd.com/ ), 
  please do n't use url shorteners . 
  this is not twitter , reddit can handle the full url . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thou it seems that thee , thou , thy and thine ( & thorn ; ee , & thorn ; ou , & thorn ; y , & thorn ; ine ) were the singular parts , and ye , you and yours were used for both plural second person and formal circumstances second person ( as it is in a lot of other languages , including greek ), 
  i was under the impression that `` thou '' was a case ( as in genitive or accusative ) . 
  well , it 's not my native language , 
  actually , i believe you have no word for `` you '' singular - not any more at least . 
  the singular `` you '' used to be `` thee '' and `` thou '' , but it fell out of practice . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://anekdota.dyndns.org/2002/0794.html ) : 1 . 
  @@ was used in univac as a path separator ( i.e. 
  like '' \\ \\ '' in windows , '' / '' in linux/macosx or '' : '' in ( classic ) mac os ) . 
  @ looks like the greek letter '' \u03c0 '' in cursive . 
  ( \u03c0 in greek is pronounced `` pee '' , not `` pie '' ) 3 . 
  when pronouncing a full path name ( e.g. 
  dir1@@dir2 ) , it was pronounced dir1 , cursive pi , cursive pi , dir2 , or in greek `` pee-pee '' . 
  the school book for the first grade had the phrase '' \u03c0\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c0\u03b1\u03c0\u03af '' ( pee pee to pa-pee , literally `` the duck goes pee-pee '' ) 5 . 
  out of of all these , it was very easy for `` dir1@@dir2 '' to become `` dir1 ducking dir2 '' of course i have no idea if this is true , but it seems as good an explanation as any , 
  i 'm afraid \u03bc\u03b1\u03ca\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd is in greece as well , 
  of course , eleftherios venizelos is n't really the foreign minister . 
  [ eleftherios venizelos ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eleftherios_venizelos ) was a very notable greek prime minister and politician that was active in 1910-1933 , and died in 1936 . 
  the current foreign minister is [ evangelos venizelos ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/evangelos_venizelos ) . 
  as far as i know , they are not related . 
  i 've never been to paris , so i ca n't really tell . 
  i guess you 're right though : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/topography_of_paris . 
  largest hill was 130 m and it was leveled ( ! ) . 
  by comparison , athens has a mountain that 's 1400 m tall , and even my own house is at about 300 m altitude , 
  i 'm sorry , i ca n't understand your point . 
  i 'm not advocating that bikes should n't be used . 
  i 'm just saying that geography ( altitude differential ) is an important factor in bike accommodation , so some cities ( such as amsterdam ) have an advantage . 
  also , while we 're at the subject , i think ( personal observation ) that motorcycles are a lot more prevalent in greece than other countries , if that says anything . 
  i 'm not sure where exactly you have been biking , but everywhere i 've been it 's always uphill ( both ways  ) . 
  the altitude differential can reach 350 m without ever leaving residential areas . 
  still , of course the largest problem is the catch-22 situation you are referring to . 
  i probably could take my bike for the 11 km distance to-and-from work , but i 'm too scared . 
  hell , sometimes i get scared while * driving * . 
  in any case , apart from the catch-22 problem , athens is quite anarchically grown , so it 's quite common to have to travel more than 20 km per day . 
  the fact that the subway does n't normally allow bikes compounds the problem . 
  amsterdam ( and netherlands in general ) are flat . 
  other cities ( such as athens - from personal experience ) are n't . 
  so , by definition , some cities ca n't be as accommodating for bikes as amsterdam . 
  you enjoy the sound of `` z '' way too much !, 
  no , this ca n't be it . 
  i know for a fact that athens is much less congested 10 ( or 12 ) years ago than it is today . 
  ca n't it be something more positive , like the fact that today 's cars are a lot safer ? 
  edit : i accidentally a word . 
   if it 's brown , flush it down , if it 's yellow , it 's mellow i 've read that as `` if it 's brown , flush it down , if it 's yellow , let it mellow '' ( from stephen king , no less  ), 
  in greece ( and cyprus ) it 's standard . 
  i would advise you to blur out the car registration number . 
  according to greeks at least , istanbul is a corruption of the phrase '' \u0395\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03a0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd '' / `` is tin polin '' , literally `` to the city '' ( as in `` i 'm going to the city '' ) , where the city ( capital `` c '' ) was always considered to be konstantinoupolis . 
  i believe the turks have a different version of the etymology , meaning `` full of islam '' or `` city of islam '' , but i think this was just a political retronaming to `` preserve the turkishness '' . 
  damn it , there should be a way to send bitcoins to the physical world ... or to pay a restaurant with paypal . 
  seems completely different than sheftalia . 
  it does seem like our own meatballs though . 
  now i 'm hungry . 
  there is a bin in the cubicle . 
   chiftele interesting . 
  this word sounds very similar to the cypriot [ sheftalia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sheftalia ) , which is a kind of meatball or skinless sausage wrapped in pig or sheep caul fat ( the membrane that surrounds the internal organs in the belly ) . 
  normally , i would guess this was some kind of turkish loanword , but this appears to be a strictly cypriot food , with french roots . 
  i disagree with hiding the downvote button . 
  personally , i actively disable custom css for certain subreddits , just in order to downvote . 
  it is not effective , and it actually makes me want to downvote more . 
  greece produces some miniature bananas from crete ( the southernmost island ) . 
  cyprus and crete are n't really cold , and they 're both islands ( so they are n't really dry ) . 
  edit : banana production is mostly done in greenhouses anyway , so the climate is n't much of a problem . 
  although a beer-flavored pie does sound nice , 
  actually , we 've spent most of that time pointing sharp things at each other . 
  also , for most of greece 's history , the western shores of what is currently known as turkey was greek ( either ionian colonies or part of the byzantine empire ) . 
  ( i 'm not advocating `` we will take it back '' or anything silly as that ; i 'm sure there is no frozen king in istanbul 's underground - i 'm just pointing out some facts ), 
    lo does n't make very good . doc or . docx files  no doubt . 
  but should it matter when we are talking about transitioning to odf ? 
  ( which is readable on the latest msoffice as well as lo , oo , and others ) why transition to an inferior ( as in : not having the same features ) specification ? 
  what microsoft cunningly did with standardizing ooxml was remove the `` do n't use proprietary formats '' argument that governments were using : ooxml is also a [ standard ] ( http://xkcd.com/927/ )    . docx ( as well as . xlsx , . pptx etc ) specifications are actually quite open . 
   they have non-standard extensions . 
  15 years ago html was also open , but aggressively contaminated with non-standard elements and scripting technologies . 
  you still have emf , vba and constantly changing definitions of the ooxml format ( 2007 and 2010 ooxml is different for example ) . 
  not to mention that most governmental publications still come in . doc ( mso2003 or xp ) . 
  `` standards '' are not an absolute good . 
  the reason html got non-standard elements ( e.g. 
  blink , marquee ) and scripting technologies is that standards moved too slow . 
  the . doc format is [ documented as well ] ( http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc313153 ( v = office .12 ) . aspx ) , although since it was a format designed to be a direct memory dump of microsoft word , in an era where saving to floppy disks was part of day-to-day operations , it 's not a ecma/iso standard . 
  it is covered by the same open specification promise though . 
  it is very lengthy , but it is for a program that exists for millions of years ( or about 30 ) . 
  you do n't need to implement the whole thing , in any case . 
  it is definitely not useless .
