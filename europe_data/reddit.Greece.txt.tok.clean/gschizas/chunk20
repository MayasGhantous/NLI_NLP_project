   why is n't the upvote/downvote system enough ? 
  because ( unfortunately ) it is n't . 
  that 's not the way reddit works . 
  low effort memes are more often upvoted because they only take a moment to take in , while thoughtful and quality articles take longer to read . 
  we aim to promote the latter in / r/europe than the former . 
   when the cartoons of europe thing was popular , mods blocked it just as it was beginning to show obscure cartoons that it was interesting to hear about this is why the `` series '' posts are n't banned , but they must now show actual effort and have more information than just an image . 
  in other words : the `` cartoons of europe '' would still thrive , and be improved from this guideline . 
   [ ... ] central planners that claim to speak for people [ ... ]  or is it that the smaller the amount of power you have , the more urge you have to do something with it ? 
  we have had many requests ( and/or reports ) for all the `` series '' posts . 
  we did n't decide this lightly or arbitrarily . 
  you are incorrect : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules#wiki_disallowed_comments.3a  ** racism , bigotry and other offensive content ** : includes but is not limited to : hate speech , genocide denial ( holocaust , ** armenian genocide ** , holodomor , etc ) , homophobia , endorsement of violence or other criminal activity . 
  i just banned you . 
  come at me . 
  i 'll even drive to the us embassy , if you think this will work ( and it 's a bitch to find parking there ) . 
  pre-emptive strike : there is nobody at reddit.com you can contact for this . 
  / r/europe is the sole responsibility of the mod team . 
  we do n't report to anyone at reddit.com , we are not employees of reddit inc. 
  sorry , no . 
  only 1st level admin divisions of sovereign european countries are allowed . 
  edit : we even have a [ relevant faq page for this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/user_flairs ) edit 2 : this means that the lancashire flag is going to be removed at some future time . 
  it was the [ holy cross region ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%9awi%c4%99tokrzyskie_voivodeship ) of poland . 
  well , he have hundreds of patron saints , one for each city ( but no * one * patron saint for all of greece ) . 
  so , take your pick edit : there are , supposedly , 5 different patron saints of greece : * the virgin mother ( why think small ? ), 
  * saint george ( yes , the same ) * apostole andrew * saint nicholas ( although i know him as the patron saint of the seas ) * apostole paul, 
  i did n't say it was serious , i said it tried to take itself seriously . 
  i liked star wreck : the pirkinning , it understood it was supposed to be a satire/homage movie . 
  iron sky had palin on the one hand and good guys moon nazis on the other - and they were really mislead , they only needed somebody to push them in the right path . 
  i dunno , it 's just the feeling i got . 
  i do n't regret buying the bluray , but it 's mostly for outside-the-movie reasons ( support for their previous movie , support for a next european sci-fi movie ... ) than for the movie itself . 
  i saw iron sky as well . 
  i was a bit disappointed though ; the movie could n't decide if it wanted to take itself seriously or not . 
  these are not even in the same game as the other browsers , let alone in the same league , 
  i still like you though . 
  i would probably agree ( i do n't work in the public sector ) , but i do n't know how useful for the economy it will be to have this many people ( with no real marketable skills ) out of work . 
  no-one ( well , almost no-one ) would disagree we need to catch more tax evaders , or that we need to make our government more efficient , or that we need to make stuff easier for small businesses . 
  these are universal goods . 
  the problem is with the * way * we go about implementing these reforms . 
  it 's very easy to say `` we need to catch more tax evaders '' . 
  it 's not as easy to say how we are going to do that . 
  * will this require more economic police presence ( which mean training , salaries , resources , and in the end money ) ? 
  * will this require something like the ( mostly failed ) project of collecting receipts electronically ( this would require cash registers with the ability to store their receipts on magnetic cards as well , not to mention it would have minimal impact , as the money is n't really hidden in the supermarkets ) ? 
  * will this require public education ( e.g. 
  ads ? 
  ) , that will have a really minimal impact ? 
  yes , soapbox politics are easy . 
  actual politics are n't . 
  well , administration reform is a very non-demonstration subject , to be honest . 
  in fact , i 'm not even sure if we can understand one way or another . 
  re : tax evasion : we ca n't go on demonstration to say `` catch more tax evaders '' . 
  oh wait , we can !, 
  ( of course we say `` catch the thieves '' , `` take from the rich , not the poor '' etc. ), 
  better conditions for private business : huh ? 
  again , `` do n't take 5 months to issue a store license '' is n't really demonstration material . 
  we have n't been quiet about it , but what can you say on a demonstration that wo n't make you part of the 1 % ? 
  actually , i 'd say for not giving money sooner . 
  mostly because she insists on austerity , when all austerity is doing is getting things worse . 
  i do n't necessarily agree , but perhaps the fixation on austerity was n't the best thing for all parties concerned ( including germany ) . 
  of course most of the problem lies with our own politicians , which prefer maintaining the status quo of having way too many public servants that do way too little work . 
  this is showcased by the recent term `` equivalent measures '' , meaning `` we wo n't fire public servants , but we will use equivalent measures , i.e. 
  reducing salaries and pensions '' . 
  still , i do n't think firing so many public servants ( with no real marketable skills ) is going to be beneficial to the economy . 
  yes , politics is n't simple . 
  it 's even more complicated when your top priority is ( or should be ) to save your economy , and not assign blame . 
  and oh boy , is there blame to be assigned !, 
  well , it would n't be the first time a part of greece wanted to be part of austria , 
  well , it seems we still have a long way to fall . 
  ( i do n't know if i should feel happy or sad about it ... ), 
  a very very small part . 
  the `` tv licence '' thingie is supposed to pay for the state tv & radio . 
  it currently has at least 5 tv stations and 5 or 6 radio stations . 
  the problem is that ( a ) almost no-one watches it ( b ) there are a lot of freeloaders hired in the organisation . 
  still , the ~ 50 $ / year/house would n't come up even to 0,1 % of what greece owes right now ( mostly in loans to cover other loans to cover other loans ) . 
  i wish that * that * was what went wrong with the greek economy ... 
  that 's nothing . 
  in ~ ~ soviet russia ~ ~ greece we have ( essentially ) a tv licence wherever there is electricity . 
  no worries  i * did * also have independent sources , gathered before the age of wikipedia and the internet , but they 're more difficult to find . 
  just read the wikipedia link above my comment . 
  no need to be sorry - you did n't steal them yourself  you just heard the usual propaganda , 
  you 're about 200 years too late , the ottoman rule is no more . 
  of course if you were suggesting to * buy * the acropolis ( for a mere couple hundred billion $ / # ) , this would be different ... , 
  you would probably have to steal the whole acropolis . 
  that 's a known false argument of the museum  the difference is that the sculptures are n't standalone works of art ; they are an organic part of the parthenon temple . 
  it may have been the ottomans ' right ( legal right at least ) , but even the ottomans were n't * that * stupid ( they were n't really stupid in any case ) . 
  they gave permission to elgin to go up there and take rubbings , molds etc. 
  and take a few stones with an inscription that was essentially lying around . 
  as we know , he did much more than that , 
  actually , he got a permission to make copies , attach scaffolding , take rubbings etc. 
  he also got permission to take a few stones with inscriptions ( not to detach said `` stones '' from the temple ! ) .
