  all these sound like wishful thinking to me . 
  last i checked , greece did n't have oil ( \u03c0\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf ) of its own . 
  the fact that the buying power of the average greek would be less than half what it is today , means it would much , much , much worse for the people . 
  we import way too much as it is , so if you ( e.g. ), 
  could only buy half the milk you can now , or half the gas , would mean that the situation would get much worse . 
  it would n't be really much better , though : 1 . 
  no-one would loan greece for the foreseeable future . 
  the wages would be in drachmas , which would be far , far lower than the originals . 
  and great english , too !, 
  ( even though they always excuse themselves for their english  ), 
  anyhow , turks themselves feel ashamed that they have youtube blocked ( note that it 's not constantly blocked - it 's only blocked from time to time ) . 
  this all goes back to some very strict ( and undemocratic ) laws that forbid anyone to imply that turkey is not turkish , or in general say anything that can be perceived as offending turkishness ( including defaming ataturk , or implying there is a kurdish mintority ) . 
  normally , some greek yahoos making bad videos for ataturk should n't be a reason to ban the whole of youtube , but some judges in turkey take their role far too seriously . 
  no , it 's not right at all , but banning youtube comes a bit low in the list of undemocratic things turkey is doing even now . 
  i believe there is an error in greece and greenland : both have gree as their short code , leading to all greeks having greenland 's flag . 
  in the stylesheet , it 's lines 346-351 . 
  lines 346-348 show the correct greek flag , but they get overridden from lines 349-351 directly below . 
  edit : thankfully , it 's the only conflict with the flags flair , as far as i can see . 
  youtube blocking was easy to bypass two years ago , when i went to turkey - just use google dns or open dns . 
  perhaps it 's changed now . 
  greece, 
  to which historic event are you referring to ? 
   that the choice to use that accounting strategy no , you got that backwards . 
  at the time ( 1999 ) esa79 was the methodology that was supposed to be used . 
  in 2004 esa95 was in place , but it was not supposed to be in place in 1999 . 
  greece did n't lie to join the euro zone . 
  with 2004 methodologies ( when the reporting - from the greek government - took place ) , greece was n't supposed to join the euro zone . 
  with 1999 methodologies ( when the actual criteria were calculated ) greece made it ( and with room to spare in fact ) . 
  the lie was the reporting from the greek government , which was done to discredit the previous government . 
  as i said before , the worst enemy of greece is greece itself . 
  as to `` borrowing more money that we should '' , it was n't really unfeasible . 
  if we had n't voted for a government that did absolutely nothing for 5 years , and that only planned for the `` happy case '' , we probably would have been in better state than a lot of countries in europe right now . 
  we did major infrastructure work up to 2004 ( thinly disguised as works for the olympics - nothing better to unite the greeks than a common goal , and nothing harder to find ) , which was then left to rot because the government changed ( and it did n't want to recognize that the previous government was anything but the scum of the earth ) . 
  the `` unfairness '' in the whole deal is due to the fact that we are indeed one of the poorest nations in europe . 
  at least there seems to be a large enough gap between middle and upper class to prompt such a response , i 'm not entirely sure . 
  i ca n't really explain how so many people could afford so many porsche cayennes ( well maybe i can ) , although there 's quite a lot less of them on the streets nowadays ( due mainly to the gas prices ) . 
  the crux of the problem is that the only ones that pay all the time are the ones with a salary ( because it 's easier to tax at the source ) . 
  we never seem to be able to tax the rich ... and i do n't believe there 's been any government that does n't promise a severe persecution of tax evasion ( and all with the same results ) . 
   trying to argue now that the the issue was simply a matter of accounting preferences seems disingenuous to me . 
  yet that is what exactly what happened . 
  of course you use accounting tricks if you want to lie in this case - you do n't have a number 100 and say it was 50 - this is easily disproved . 
  in any case , the actual change indeed was very specific : greece used the esa79 methodology when reporting data for 1997-1999 , under which it had a deficit of 1.8 % , when using the esa95 methodology it should have been 3.4 % . 
  the point is that in 1997-1999 , the current accounting practice was indeed esa79 , while in 2004 the practice was esa95 . 
  all these were of course `` according to the information provided by the greek authorities '' ( which brings me back to the fact that greece is its own worst enemy ) . 
  how do you define innovation ? 
  greece does have a lot of industries ( light industries mostly , and most are related to agricultural products ) , but its main economy pillars are tourism and shipping . 
  greece has the largest commercial ( by which i mean tankers , container ships etc ) in the world . 
  it also rebounded from a wwii occupation and really made strides comparable to japan 's recovery ( to scale ) . 
  there was a [ greek economic miracle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_economic_miracle ) although to be fair , given the political turmoil that has been happening in greece at the same time - although some would say since forever - i do n't think anyone refers to that period as any kind of miracle . 
  in any case , that is indeed in the past ( although not in ancient times ) , but still , i 'd say there 's been quite a lot of innovation even in the recent years . 
  not that you 'd know about them , they 're not as flashy as the ipod for example . 
  then again , i do n't know about any innovation that 's happening from austria for example ( there probably is , but it 's probably not as flashy ) . 
  i * wish * we had a greek ministry of propaganda ... no , this was simply a case of overzealous greeknuts ( i have no idea how to translate the word `` ellinares '' ... ) tax avoidance is indeed a national custom , but quite a lot of us are not that `` lucky '' to be able to participate . 
  civil service does n't really serve nepotism ( it 's not relatives we have to worry about ) - it serves partisanship and reelections . 
   i care that greece lied to join the euro ( they concealed how bad their debts were ) not true . 
  this is just another manifestation of the worst enemy of greece , which is , of course , greece itself . 
  and i guess some media ball dropping . 
  all in all a common misconception . 
  in 2004 , a little while before the olympic games , we had a change of government . 
  the centrist/socialist party pasok was voted off , and the right/conservative nd was voted in . 
  nd ( as is `` tradition '' ) wanted to downplay any achievements of the previous government ( for the past 9 years ) . 
  for this , they ordered an audit of the economics of the state , and `` found out '' that the previous government had under-reported some financial figures . 
  of course they made quite a show of this , but the truth is that , while with the * 2004 methods * , greece had a deficit of * 3.4 % * ( happy times ... ) , with the * 1999 methods * , it had * less than the required 3 % * . 
  the `` funny '' thing is that eurostat has now reverted to the the 1999 methods to calculate deficits . 
  look here as well ( to be fair , i did n't know that the `` not lying '' part was so well documented ) : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_greece#eurozone_entry, 
  bauxite --  aluminium mountains --  marble ergo producing . 
  but in any case , i would n't say that any kind of producing is a major part of the greek economy . 
  greek economy is mostly comprised by shipping , tourism , constructions and the public sector ( in general ) . 
  greece * does * have the largest commercial fleet in the world , after all . 
  other than that , the most `` producing '' ( there 's got to be a better word than that ) that greece has and exports , is on agricultural and related products . 
  this video was probably produced by a overzealous greek - it * is * a bit rubbish . 
  it 's probably made more to circle-jerk between greeks than to reach out to europeans - regardless what its stated purpose is ... 
  regarding to what greece produces , marble , aluminium etc are indeed `` stuff we dig from the ground '' , but how is this not `` producing '' ? 
  marble does n't magically pop-out and sell itself , digging it from the ground is actual work . 
  as for aluminium , it does take a kind of factory to produce it out of bauxite  in any case , yes , we do n't have any heavy industry ( and this is our fault , for over-unionizing and over-relying on the public sector ) . 
  we could be having at least a car factory ( nissan - if only for car parts and not whole cars ) and a tire factory ( pirelli ) , but , out of * our * stupidity , we managed to push them away to turkey . 
  the picture was not of the corinth canal ( which was built in 1882-1893 ) , but of the * new * corinth canal bridge  ( i ca n't find much information about it , but it was definitely delivered sometime between 1993-1998 : i remember passing the old one with my high-school in 1993 , and i probably used the new one with my university class in 1998 ) disclaimer : i am greek , but i found the video too cheesy to finish . 
  yes , we do work more than we are credited for , especially the private sector , yes , we did build a lot of infrastructure , but the persecution complex that we have is just us trying to push responsibility to someone else . 
  here you go then : http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=ave_hrs greece is just after turkey and korea , ahead of all other european countries ( turkey is almost european ) . 
  ## background : let me first preface this with the fact that after becoming mod in / r/europe and having to handle the user flairs ( flags ) , i have gained immense appreciation for the `` bureaucrats '' in brussels . 
  having to deal with so many different types of organizations among countries and trying to fit them all in one single semblence of order must require bucketloads of patience . 
  ## we are simplifying the list of user flairs ( flags ) * the rule for user flairs has been that all countries get a user flair ( european countries should all be there already , but there may be some non-european that are n't represented ) , as well as first level administrative regions ( regions ) of european countries , as defined by iso 3166 standard . 
  of course , for them to be represented , regions must actually have a flag . 
  * apart from the fact that the user flair selection has become a bit too difficult , reddit has a hard limit of 350 user-selectable flairs , and we have n't even put the first level administrative regions of several countries . 
  * the rule for a country to be included is that the country is sovereign , it is recognized by more than 50 % of the council of europe members , and that it does have an iso 3166 code . 
  * the rule for a region to be included , is that the country is in europe , it has an iso 3166 code , it has an actual flag ( not a coat of arms ) and somebody has requested it . 
  * regions will follow the format ``` region '' ( `` country '' ) ` . 
  the ones that do n't follow that format , will ( eventually ) be changed . 
  ## what this means for you : in the following days ( well , depends on my workload for my paying job ) , i will be merging several irregular user flairs with their proper ones . 
  for some flairs , the change will be completely transparent ( the only change will be the user flair css class ) . 
  for other flairs , the change will be a bit more profound . 
  specifically : * user flairs that are simply duplicate ( because i had created one region first , and then created all the regions of that country ) will be replaced transparently ( e.g. 
  ` corsica ` will be replaced with ` corsica ( france ) ` ) * user flairs that use historical ( e.g. 
  ` belarus ` ) or irredentist/independits flags ( e.g. 
  ` catalonia ` ) will be replaced with the current flag or the regional flag , respectively . 
  * user flairs that use countries that are n't recognized ( e.g. 
  ` ichkeria ` ) will be removed . 
  * user flairs that use flags of ethnical groups ( e.g. 
  ` sami ` , ` roma ` ) will be removed . 
  * the ` earth ` flag and the ` anarchy ` flag will also be removed * regions that do n't cover the criteria that were mentioned above will be replaced by their respective countries ( e.g.
