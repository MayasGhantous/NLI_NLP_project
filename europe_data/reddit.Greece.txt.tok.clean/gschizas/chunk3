  edit : it is * very * lengthy : the iso spec is about 7200 pages long !, 
  i opened word from scratch in my 2 year old , 16 gb ram , ssd equipped desktop , and it took more time to double click the file than word to open . 
  this does n't prove much , obviously , 
  lo does n't make very good . doc or . docx files 2 . 
  . docx ( as well as . xlsx , . pptx etc ) specifications are actually quite open . 
  they are definitely not licenced only to clients . 
  they are ecma standards ( ecma-376 : `` office open xml file formats '' ) . 
  they are also part of microsoft 's open specification promise :  microsoft irrevocably promises not to assert any microsoft necessary claims against you for making , using , selling , offering for sale , importing or distributing any implementation to the extent it conforms to a covered specification . 
  i can send you several . 
  just add a `` table '' in an excel ( 2007 + ) file , and see almost everything related to it fail . 
  i 've only been once in thessaloniki , so ... 
  i 've seen it in istanbul as well . 
  it was very helpful , indeed . 
  of course * we * ca n't afford it , either . 
  and zoom out ... and zoom out ... and zoom out ... 
  not really ... 
  this is a ( disproven ) myth . 
  i can tell you there are about 1500 subscribers in / r/greece , if that 's any help ... 
  unicode also has & #x 20af ; but afaik no-one in greece ever used it , 
  btw , did you put `` protogal '' instead of `` portugal '' as your flair on purpose ? 
  for any reading : ert is still broadcasting in analogue at channel 11 from parnitha . 
  ( personally i only see a black screen ) . 
  in the original french , yes . 
  in greek , he was called cacophonix ( at least according to most comics i 've read ), 
  damn , i did n't remember him until i saw his impossibly black-and-white face  now that i think of it , i barely remember know his name in the first place , 
  do you mean inpsector rex , the austrian police series with the german shepherd dog ? 
  this is way more recent than bolek & lolek . 
  i worked with some polish people and they were very happy we knew bolek & lolek , 
  almost all translations change the names in the comics . 
  in the original , gettafix/druidix was named panoramix , unhygenix/fishtix was named ordralfabetix . 
  in greek , most of the names remained untranslated from the original french , with some exceptions ( the bard was named cacofonix , same as the british translation , the fish seller was named alphabetix etc. ), 
  do n't you mean koenigsegg ? 
  yet it is . 
  ( a ) you can type this : `  what he said ` to get this :  what he said ( b ) you can leave one space between the ` * ` and the rest of the text , like so : ` * item one ` ` * item two ` ` * item three ` to get this : * item one * item two * item three ( also leave one empty line before and after ) ( c ) ( the real point ) * central african republic : well , at least it has one more word in it . 
  it can also be shortened to car , which is also cool  . 
  still , it has no character whatsoever . 
  d - * australia : it literally means `` southern land '' , but at leasts it 's in latin , so it gets a c + for effort  * united states of america : it has united , it has states ... and it has usurped the name of a contintent . 
  d + * the netherlands : when you look at a map , you would * never * guess that the whole country should be under the water . 
  also , it sounds like `` the netherworld '' , and this could definitely be a level in a platform game . 
  at least a b ( i 'd even be persuaded by a few purple bridges to up this to an a ) . 
  well , it 's not exactly the same . 
  i do n't know the names of the cities in my own country that have 13 000 people . 
  but i definitely know most countries in europe ( i blame the fall of communism for the ones i do n't know ) and where they are . 
  i mostly know about the largest states in usa , obviously because of their prominence in films . 
  i 'd say i know the least about africa , especially countries in the mid-west and south ( except south africa , obviously - btw , this must be the most generic name for a country ever ) . 
  of course , if i was asked in the middle of the street from some greedy-for-quotes reporter , i would probably answer just as bad as that notorious video . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pierre,_south_dakota , pop 13646 . 
  man , how many presidents have you got assasinated ? 
  secret service sounds like a very good idea , after all !, 
  in greek , we call sour orange ( citrus aurantium ) '' \u039d\u03b5\u03c1\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b6\u03b9 / nerantzi '' ( prounounced neh-rah-djee ) . 
  this is curiously similar to laranja/naranja/orange . 
  we * do * have our conspiracy theories , same as every other nation : * the jews control everything . 
  * freemasons control everything . 
  * usa controls everthing . 
  * barcodes have `` 666 '' in them . 
  * eu is the antichrist ( because , at the time i read about that , it had 12 members ) . 
  * eu controls everything . 
  * germans owe us money from wwii . 
  * all political parties secretly are the same . 
  * ancient greeks were more advanced in technology than we are current day . 
  * atlantis were where greeks * really * come from . 
  * greek was supposed to be the official language of usa , but it lost for one vote ( and it was a jew that voted against ) . 
  i could probably go on ... 
  they are conspiracy theories through-and-through , and most people just laugh at them . 
  obviously the `` wwii reparations '' meme is very popular right now , for the apparent reasons , but the average greek does n't give too much credence to it ( source : i am greek , and i am average  ), 
  ** technically ** we ** are ** the roman empire : roman empire conquered greece , roman empire became byzantium ( aka `` eastern roman empire '' ) , byzantium was conquered by the ottoman empire , greece declared independence from the ottoman empire . 
  ( that said , it 's really conspiracy-theory-grade drivel , and frankly , it 's tiresome seeing these kinds of `` news '' and `` demands '' all the time . 
  the sane greeks * do * know that everything was wiped clean shortly after the war ), 
  not to mention that our leaders were competent all along . 
  well , 1 in a million is a bit over-confident . 
  i 'm sure there are more than 11 members of golden dawn in greece ... 
  well , we probably have some '' \u0392\u03bf\u03c3\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 '' or '' \u0392\u03bf\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd '' ( voskos/voskou ) , but i ca n't think of anyone right now . 
  we definitely have '' \u0392\u03bb\u03ac\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5 '' ( vlahou ) which , for some reasons , is closer to the spirit of the word . 
  perhaps there was a negative connotation with herding sheep or something , or ( on the other hand ) it was so common that nobody though to use it as a surname , 
  well , tbh , this is the story i heard from my father ( who * is * cypriot , as am i - even though i was born and live in greece ) . 
  my grandfather had the same surname as my father and me , his brothers ( by great uncles ) had a completely different surname . 
  he even knows a brother and sister that had completely different surnames . 
  some schools were demanding an actual birth certificate to enroll you , some others did n't care ( and you could in fact pick your own surname ) . 
  perhaps it was a local thing , my father grew up at the north of limassol . 
  there was indeed a push to `` erase '' some history , but perhaps it was n't as strong . 
  a goat * herder * perhaps ? 
  well , * technically * most surnames are patronymic . 
  they were made to * change * their surnames ? 
  i always thought ( they way i heard it ) that they did n't care enough to have one in the first place !, 
  also - poulos , not - polous , 
  yes they can . 
  if you are an ( orthodox ) priest , you can be married ( and have children ) , provided you get married * before * becoming a priest . 
  in absolute numbers , having a 10 % tax on your property is probably not even close to what greek citizens have been paying , either by directly paying property taxes ( like the one-time-only housing tax that is going to be repeated this year ) , or by taking pay cuts , or by simply losing their jobs . 
  that given , the problem with taking a ( even one-time-only ) tax levy on * deposits * ( even more , on supposedly * insured * deposits ) is n't the actual money that is going to be taken . 
  it 's the fact that the next day , every depositor will withdraw all their money ( even the 90 % that 's left ) from the bank , thereby leading to the collapse of the banks themselves , leading to exactly the same result ( actually , to a far worse result ) as if the tax levy was n't applied in the first place . 
  so , yes , this was incredibly short-sighted and stupid . 
  yes , this is correct . 
  i 'm not entirely sure of the origin of the word `` troika '' , but it may well be from russian . 
   whose depositers will fall victim to a new tax or confiscation ? 
  probably none , because there wo n't be any depositors left . 
  i 'm predicting a huge bank run on monday ( or perhaps tuesday - it 's ash monday in greece and cyprus tomorrow ) . 
  hellas ( \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2 , \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1 , greece ) was the name of a tribe ( selloi , \u03a3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03af ) on the northwest of greece ( dodoni / \u0394\u03bf\u03b4\u03ce\u03bd\u03b7 , which is in epirus , south of albania ) , supposedly the tribe of achilles . 
  on another etymology , sellas/hellas comes from the root sel which means light ( northern lights are called selas / \u03c3\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03c2 in greek , the moon is called selene / \u03a3\u03b5\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7 etc. ), 
  and the suffix `` las '' which roughly means stone ( like lithos / \u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 ) . 
  so sellas/hellas is light stone or holy stone .
