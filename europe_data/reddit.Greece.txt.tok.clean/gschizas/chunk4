  greece comes from a neighbouring village/tribe ( or perhaps it was how illyrians called selloi ) . 
  its roots are even more obscure , but the root grae - probably meant something like ( graeii / \u0393\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03af means old ones ) . 
  so graeki means old men ( or perhaps wise men ) . 
  note that selloi/graeki were probably involved in the dodoni oracle , which was dedicated to zeus , so there may have been a large number of priests ( hence the `` old men '' ) . 
  this is further supported by the georgian name for greeks , saberdzneti , which literally means `` wise people '' yunan comes from ionia , which was the name of a region of greek colonies in asia minor , in what is now turkey , near izmir/smyrna . 
  ion ( apart from a brand of chocolate ) was the name of one of the three tribes that consisted second wave of tribes that formed ancient greeks . 
  it 's difficult to know what it meant , but one opinion says that it 's from the root iwn - that means tree trunk . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** greece means country of the holy stone or country of the old men . 
  explain cyprus ( 3rd ) then . 
  how on earth is cyprus 3rd and greece last , then ? 
  i mean , sheftalies are definitely extremely good quality . 
  i wish i had that kind of foresight . 
  i would n't have lost a small hatchback in stocks if i did ... , 
  hello / r/europe . 
  looking forward to helping this subreddit , 
  i nominate myself , i 'm good with janitorial work ( spam queue ) , and css . 
  i 'm already a mod in / r/greece , and i 'm a firm believer in a hands-off approach ( only obvious spam and the occasional troll should be removed ), 
  and sweden , norway , finland , denmark and iceland vote for each other , germany votes for turkey and vice versa , england votes for ireland & vv , spain votes for portugal & vv and so on ... 
  the only time greece won , we took advantage of that and got a singer that had been born and raised in sweden , 
  hence the song , 
  they could get issued temporary licences or something . 
  or there could be an override button , 
  a little bit older but * i * liked it : [ para pente ( 2005-2006 ) ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0491739/ ) . 
  for a greek comedy series , it sure had some adventure . 
  i 'm not sure the jokes translate very well , of course . 
  so , it seems that danes are added to the `` my english is awful ( yet i speak in perfect english ) '' list ... , 
  not to sound inconsiderate , but i 've only seen swedes use this `` my english is awful '' ( in perfect english ) thing !, 
  ( and yes , most greeks , including me , sound truly awful - i sound like an indian in slow motion ) edit : i 've found this : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0hwlwkmick and he does n't sound all that bad . 
  edit 2 : greeks * do * sound awful , swedes do not . 
  meant `` the determination '' . 
  it 's probably the first time i see a swede use something other than perfect english though ( of course while apologizing for his awful english ) , 
  ugly is in the eye of the beholder ( or something ) . 
  while you may find black people ugly , they are ( probably ) not ugly according to other black people .

  except from editorialization , there 's also the thing called sensationalization . 
  in other words : titles of pages on user content sites ( such as youtube or liveleak ) may be removed even if the title of the post is the same as the title of the page . 
  the editorialization/sensationalization rules extend to the external site as well . 
  at least it wo n't be fringe politics * within * the governing party . 
  i disagree . 
  it 's a hack , and one that wo n't scale or migrate . 
  i 'd rather wait for reddit to implement proper report reasons . 
  not really . 
  these are css hacks , they are n't visible if : * you have disabled subreddit css * you are viewing this from the mobile site * you are using any kind of mobile application . 
  these ( and more ) are also the reasons that `` filters '' do n't work . 
  from the comment you linked ( my emphasis ) :  bots which are archiving entire subreddits for the purpose of undeleting or unediting comments are ** not ok **, 
  i 've answered this elsewhere - we will be evaluating the whole list going forward . 
  this is out of the [ reddiquette ] ( / wiki/reddiquette ) :  # please do n't  * ** repost deleted/removed information . 
  ** remember that comment someone just deleted because it had personal information in it or was a picture of gore ? 
  resist the urge to repost it . 
  it does n't matter what the content was . 
  if it was deleted/removed , it should stay deleted/removed . 
  unreliable source applies to news items and infographics , it does n't really apply to `` so , you want to visit x '' , or '' [ ... of europe ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/dotdotdot_of_europe_series ) '' for example - there 's no point there . 
  we will be evaluating the whole list in the following days . 
  it falls under the unreliable source category . 
  some explanation on what the report reasons currently mean ( at least until reddit implements custom report reasons for each subreddit ) : * ** spam ** : although this should be clear on its own , it does n't appear to be so . 
  this is supposed to be used if somebody for example advertises their own site . 
  if it 's a comment , especially without a link , this is probably not the option you want to use . 
  the only time it 's acceptable is if the user is copy-pasting the same comment all over the place . 
  * ** vote manipulation ** : i 'm not even sure how you can tell . 
  but in general , it means that this user appears to have a lot of upvotes within seconds of making a comment/submission . 
  i do n't think it 's possible to tell , if you are an end user ( and are not working at reddit inc. ) . 
  * ** personal information ** : doxxing . 
  if you see someone giving out some user 's real name , their email , their ip address , their physical address , etc. 
  * ** sexualizing minors ** : this means child pornography . 
  * ** breaking reddit ** : attempts to break/hack reddit 's code . 
  for example some comment that is too long in some way and makes reddit crash . 
  i have never seen any use for that . 
  * ** other ** : this is almost always the correct choice . 
  write a short description of what rule you think this comment is breaking ( e.g. 
  personal attacks , meme/low quality post etc. ), 
  to be honest , i do n't think that the default 5 report reasons that reddit gives are really all that useful . 
  we are working on managing the sources in a more scalable way . 
  most of them are public anyway and you already know about them ( e.g. 
  wordpress , tumblr or straight links to google search ) .
