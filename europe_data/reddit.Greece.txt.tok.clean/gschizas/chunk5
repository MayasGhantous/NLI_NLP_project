  for obvious reasons , some of them will have to remain secret ( spam sites ) . 
  others will probably be public . 
  i do n't know what to do with an extensive list of some 287 porn sites - which i 'm not really sure were useful as an `` avoid-spam '' list to begin with ( they were probably copy-pasted from some other subreddit in the first place ) . 
  weirdly enough , you get [ all kinds of houses ] ( http://www.xe.gr/property/search?system.item_type=re_residence&amp;transaction.type_channel=117518&amp;geo.area_id_new__hierarchy=82196&amp;geo.coded=1&amp;asset.has_photos=1&amp;item.condition=32024,32023&amp;transaction.price.from=300000&amp;transaction.price.to=300000&amp;sort_by=item.area&amp;sort_direction=asc ) : from a [ 600 m \u00b2 two story house with a pool ] ( http://www.xe.gr/property/poliseis%7ckatoikies%7cmati%7c90131361%7c%cf%86%cf%89%cf%84%ce%bf%ce%b3%cf%81%ce%b1%cf%86%ce%b9%ce%b5%cf%82.html ) , at a very nice suburb .

  is it something like this : http://i.imgur.com/dsqjw8q.png ( they are called rusks or \u03c6\u03c1\u03c5\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ad\u03c2 / fryganies in greek ) or perhaps something like this : http://i.imgur.com/hcokt6d.jpg ( also called rusks in english , but they are called \u03c0\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03bc\u03ac\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 / paximadia in greek ) the first ones are very brittle and generally easy to chew ( although you will get crumbs all over the place ) . 
  the second ones ( although they are essentially the same ) are very hard , and if you try to chew them without wetting them or having them in a salad ( like croutons , i guess , although they are much larger ) you may crack a tooth . 
  you put a ` ' ` in your comment , when you obviously wanted to just write #readthefuckingpost . 
  i 'm just helping out with some markdown , nothing more . 
  put a backslash to escape the '' # '' , i.e. 
  type ` \\ #readthefuckingpost ` to get this : \\ #readthefuckingpost, 
  what dry bread ?
