  how do you usually call it ? 
  you 're going around the spirit of the rule , but ok . 
  not really , i 'm afraid . 
  the second half of my comment was that you should n't be using google search as a link . 
  just link to what you think was relevant from the search page ; your results and the results of others may be completely different .

  people that comment on newspaper sites are even more extreme than redditors . 
  you need to have a very high tolerance for trolling/conspiritards/neckbeards / whatever to read those comments . 
  really , if i go by greek newspapers , they are usually * much * worse than youtube comments ( even though that would seem impossible ) . 
  there is a rumor that there is going to be a vote of no confidence mainly to bring down the speaker of the parliament [ zoi konstantopoulou ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zoi_konstantopoulou ) , who was one of those that opposed the authorization vote of friday , because the ministers can be `` fired '' , as well as the mps , but you ca n't `` fire '' the speaker of the parliament .

  actually , i think you 'd find that we 'd welcome ( a ) german ( i.e. 
  incorruptible ) tax accountants ( b ) french police ( i have no idea what 's wrong - or right - with french police , but i 'm not sure what finnish fiscal policies would be . 
  i 'm afraid that being in a corrupt environment though , german tax accountants as well as french policemen would get corrupted as well .

  i 've noticed that your original url makes too many redirections . 
  i 'd suggest to use the original url ( i.e. 
  http://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/56/01/e7/5601e7552c3103b438a3a596286d8ba6.jpg ) or make an imgur mirror , instead .

  well , we did n't have a referendum three years ago , so that was new ... we also did n't have banks closed and capital controls three years ago . 
  come on , do n't tell us we are boring you , there 's always something new around the corner !, 
  press one more [ enter ] after `` lets see : '' , this would fix your formatting . 
  note that nbg , alpha and piraeus are mostly (  50 % ) state owned ( via the emergency fund thingie ) , while eurobank is  50 % owned by private owners .

  according to [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_greeks_by_net_worth ) , there should be . 
  philip niarchos ' net worth is $ 11.5 billion , spiros latsis ' is $ 11.4 billion . 
  both have more net worth from several other rich people in the list . 
  i 'm afraid that ship has sailed . 
  your comments are getting removed by reddit ( not even by automoderator ) . 
  i 'm not sure which link triggers this ( you have way too many ) . 
  look for any link shorteners ( url shorteners ) , reddit disagrees with them big time ( and with good reason ) .
