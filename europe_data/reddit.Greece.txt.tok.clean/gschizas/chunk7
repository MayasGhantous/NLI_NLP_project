  i 'd take a sack of iphones . 
  it 's an old greek phrase : `` who ever gets angry , should drink vinegar '' . 
  it means something close to `` chill out '' , but when you say `` chill out '' you can imagine some very mellow dude telling you to `` chill out man , it 's going to be ok '' . 
  vinegar was an old wives ' home remedy for indigestion . 
  so , when you say `` vinegar '' , the connotation is that `` i do n't take your anger seriously , you are n't really angry , you just have indigestion '' . 
  the above picture is one of the most common greek vinegar brands . 
  note that i may or may not be a victim of propaganda . 
  this weekend has n't really been very easy , as you can understand ... 
  i 've seen that suggestion as well . 
  personally , i 'm using my credit card for just about everything ( the only things i buy with cash are magazines and heating oil for the burner ) , so i would gladly switch to this model . 
  but i am the exception and i seriously doubt this would be feasible or effective . 
  there * are * ways around that . 
  essentially , you turn euros/usd/gbp / whatever to black-market currency . 
  it has been done in the past , it 's not something new ( but then again , credit cards did n't exist back then ) . 
  still , it would be nice to bribe your doctor with eggs and olive oil . 
  sidenote : the greek common slang for bribing is `` oiling '' , at least in part because olive oil ( in large , [ 16lt tin cans ] ( http://i.imgur.com/e3petwt.jpg ) ) was used as a common bribe . 
  edit : 16 liter , not 16 tons !, 
  edit 2 : a better picture : http://i.imgur.com/fxfain6.jpg ( bananas for scale , of course ), 
   the results of the referendum will have magical powers that will suddenly cause the other countries to kneel and throw more money at greece because `` democracy '' . 
  this is ( unsurprisingly ) the same argument they used after winning the elections with ( and the same argument the won the elections with ) . 
  yes , they * do * seem to think that because the `` people '' said so , all other countries must submit to their will ( as if other countries do n't have people ) . 
  i disagree . 
  gd is a recent player ( in the parliament etc. ) . 
  also , gd is anti-eu only because all the other parties are ( supposedly ) pro-eu ( except kke of course ) . 
  kke is anti-eu , anti-nato , anti-everything for 40 years now . 
  they win just by perseverance . 
  sadly , his proposal is minutely different than this ; at least according to the leaked documents we have seen . 
   i really do n't think the greeks realize quite how insane their levels of tax evasion look to the rest of the civilized world . 
  we realize it . 
  it is n't as easy as you would think to fight these levels of tax evasion , especially given the structure of the greek economy ( a vast amount of less-than-5 employees stores , for example ), 
   the situation is better on the islands . 
  no , it just means nobody will care if someone on the islands goes on riots or strikes . 
  quite a lot of them only have a few hundred residents . 
  that ca n't produce a proper riot . 
  it had hardly produce a pub run . 
  i saw multiple atms having long queues , and none of the people queuing was old enough to be a pensioner . 
  your title is n't the original title , nor does it describe the article itself . 
  it 's your own opinion , injected in the submission title . 
  this is called editorialization , and it 's against the rules of / r/europe . 
  it does n't matter that the title is n't `` my opinion on this is ... '' , you are injecting new meaning in the page by using your own title . 
  i have removed the submission , as it certainly is against the rule stated above . 
  the same rule applies in / r/greece , btw . 
  yeah , you 'd be too late . 
  greek citizens have already run to the banks , and wiped them clean . 
  no , both are illogical . 
  one is simply more illogical than the other . 
  greek is a bit more logical in that matter , but it maintains the same reversed order for 11 and 12 . 
  it was n't always like this though , it used to be that 13 was three-and-ten , but now it 's simple ten-three . 
  so there 's still hope , 
  it originally meant `` i 'm smearing shit on your face '' . 
  you be the judge , 
  we are people , too . 
  ( well , not me , personally , i 'm classified as a meat popsicle , but you get the idea ) . 
  ( it was lost in the modmail , i 've added it now ), 
  / r/greece is a cesspool, 
  i could approve it , if you have any kind of proof it was as posted , but since it only got 5 upvotes , i think it would be better to resubmit it . 
  you were too fast !, 
  i was still editing my comment !, 
  it is n't off topic , it 's editorialized . 
  this may be because bbc changed the title , i understand . 
  thank you for your submission !,
