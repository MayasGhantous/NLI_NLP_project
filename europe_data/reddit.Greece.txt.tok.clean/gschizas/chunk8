  unfortunately , it has been removed for editorialization . 
  there is no mention of ` losing sleep ' in the article . 
  this may be because bbc changed the title , of course , but we have no way to check that . 
  feel free to resubmit the content in accordance with the rules .

  we apologize for the inconvenience . 
  i only wish the greek government was as effective as / r/europe ... :(, 
  this was made into a self-post for the obvious purpose of avoiding the `` no editorialization '' rule . 
  we are not machines ( well , not all of us at least ) , we can tell when a post is trying to subvert that rule . 
  please refrain from using link shorteners such as bit.ly . 
  they obscure the actual url you 're linking to , and result to your comment getting caught in the spam filter . 
  you can use markdown to make a link ( just type ` [ link name ] ( htttp : / / any.url.goes.here ) ` ) . 
  if your link url has special characters ( such as '' ) '' ) , use ` \\ ) ` to escape them . 
  edit your comment to replace the url with the correct one so it can be approved .

  please refrain from using the google search page instead of the regular page . 
  using the google search page has privacy issues both for you and the other redditors .

  you still have n't . 
  you should n't use the google search page instead of the actual page - this gets caught by the spam filter . 
  please change your url to the proper one ( http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/apps/nlnet/content.aspx?c=lskwlbpjlnf&amp;b=8776547&amp;ct=1451264 ) , otherwise your comment will remain removed . 
  reply to me when you 've done that . 
  yes , there 's a ukrainian flag . 
  this is not / r/eu , this is / r/europe  it 's in the middle column , & #x 2116 ; 14 from the top ( under turkey , just after the first `` page '' ), 
  perhaps it was from some other program , or from accessibility options or something . 
  or perhaps it 's a case of bad video drivers . 
  in any case , it 's supposed to be the same for all hover items , so you [ should be able to see some text if you hover above this link ] ( http://www.example.com `` this link wo n't go anywhere special '' ) edit : if you open regedit and go to ` hkey_current_user \\ control panel \\ mouse ` , you should see a ` mousehovertime ` entry ( with the value of ` 400 ` ) . 
  also ` mousehoverheight ` and ` mousehoverwidth ` should have the value of ` 4 ` . 
  are you on windows or on a mac ? 
  once upon a time , the mouse hover time was some setting in windows , but i have no idea where it 's gone now . 
  if you see the mouse cursor with the question mark , you have probably increased that hover time to way too long . 
  it 's an easy registry fix in any case . 
  if you have a mac , i do n't know how to help ( but i 'll try to find out ), 
  i hope you 're not talking about the picture i posted in / r/greece earlier today , 
  when you say question-mark , is this the mouse cursor ? 
  it 's supposed to be like that for a few seconds ( or even under a second ) . 
  this is what i get : http://www.gfycat.com/yellowishviciousgreathornedowl, 
  beats me !, 
  you are supposed to see them , especially with chrome . 
  res does n't come into it , i can see the hover text ( the title text , really ) even with ie . 
  have you tried another browser ? 
  or even incognito mode ( i find incognito mode a very good solution to be sure that no extension interferes ) . 
  i think he is bulgarian . 
  you would be surprised, 
  reddit only has a single user flair css class ( rightfully so , imho ) . 
  so , in order to be able to select two flags , we should make all possible combinations , which would come to a very large number ( it 's not easy to maintain as it is ( with about 300 flags ) , it would be impossible to do with about 100.000 flags !, 
  you can either use the one you 're ( mostly ) living in or the flag of the european union , and change the flair to e.g. 
  greece/germany . 
  i do n't know , the sidebar is pretty full as it is , and in my experience , the sidebar gets ignored more often than not .

  it 's a common question to the moderators . 
  it 's always frustrating for me to describe it through words ( `` go next to your username on the right sidebar , above the ` filter russia , ukraine , nato ' green button '' etc. ), 
  why give directions on a map , when you use a gps ? 
  it seems it 's a very common question in / r/europe , so i thought that a small video ( gif ) would help those that do n't know about it . 
  one-europe . info falls under the blogspam category and as such , your post has been automatically removed . 
  you can submit the original source , here : http://www.statista.com/chart/3297/greeks-work-the-longest-hours-in-europe/, 
  this is a reference to the fact that varoufakis was a consultant for valve , which is the largest distribution channel for pc gaming . 
  see / r/pcmasterrace for more info . 
  it 's mostly a tongue in cheek reference , do n't read too much into it . 
  i 'm sorry , but editorializing ( putting your opinion in the post title ) is not allowed in / r/europe . 
  this post has been removed ( de-listed ) , but you are welcome to resubmit it with a proper title . 
  the default title from the guardian ( `` migrant tragedies : what can be done to end the crisis ? '' ), 
  or what you 've used ( `` nine ways to deal with the mediterranean migrant crisis . '' ), 
  are both ok . 
  this has been implemented from time to time . 
  it is certainly being considered currently . 
  i still have n't been able to wrap my head around the oauth2 protocol that reddit uses . 
  i already have a couple of scripts running , but i 've cheated a bit with them . 
  yes , since i 'm a professional developer ( as in , that 's my day job ) , i 'm probably a good choice for an outsourcer for this . 
  i 'm not exactly sure what exactly we want to do here ( that is n't covered by automoderator or automoderator scheduler ), 
  the thresholds are different for each subreddit . 
  we still have nothing to do with that . 
  i wish we did , but we do n't . 
  subverting the rules of reddit is even worse than editorializing . 
  stop doing either . 
  we ( / r/europe moderators ) have nothing to do with that .
