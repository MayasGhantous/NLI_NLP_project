  i 've only seen this and another scene . 
  i know the premise , but i only know a few fragments of polish . 
  you 've now convinced me to get it though , i 've quoted it far more times than should be healthy ,

  yes , case , not clause , you 're right ( i probably need sleep ) . 
  also , it 's different for 1 , different for 2-4 and different for 5-10 . 
  also , if i remember correctly , 22-24 , 32-34 etc. 
  also use the 2-4 case ( 12-14 are exempt ) . 
  i 've had to implement in software the wordification of numbers for polish ( i.e. 
  you input `` 15 '' , you get `` fifteen '' , you input `` 31 '' you get `` thirty-one '' etc. 
  ) , some years ago , so you can imagine it was painful . 
  i know you ca n't really explain or have any reasons for grammar , it 's just the hole in my soul ( left by polish grammar ) that 's screaming , 
  note : using a self text instead of an actual link post ( as this one is supposed to be ) is n't a way to subvert the editorialization rule . 
  hmmm ... now polish does sound a bit more clear . 
  how do you defend having eleventy grammatical cases and changing case for each number ? 
  edit : grammatical case , not grammatical clause . 
  and * i * thought you would post [ the actual timeless classic ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3avcgv6tije ), 
  it was turkish , indeed . 
  an ethnicity can not be more lazy . 
  lazy is n't a quantitative measure . 
  [ average height ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_height#average_height_around_the_world ) is measurable . 
  [ average weight ( or bmi ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/body_weight#average_weight_around_the_world ) is measurable . 
  even average skin , hair or eye color are measurable ( as frequencies ) . 
  when you meet someone , you do n't need to assume they are taller or shorter than you because of your ethnicity ; you can see it . 
  on the other hand , assuming someone is lazy , or criminal or brilliant or whatever because of his ethnicity is definitely racist , not to mention wrong ( and i do n't mean ethically wrong ) . 
  as to iq , it does n't really mean much anyway , it has cultural bias etc. 
  yes , it is ** a ** measure , but it 's not as definitive as height or weight . 
  some say it 's even pseudoscience . 
  otherwise , same arguments apply . 
   so saying that americans are fat is not allowed i guess ? 
  not ** all ** americans are fat . 
  not all americans are fatter than all europeans . 
   is it ok to suggest that races or cultures are better in specific aspects ? 
  not sure where you 're going with this . 
  the dutch are taller for example , but does that make them better ? 
   what do you mean by `` unreliable '' ? 
  anybody can open a blogspot/tumblr/facebook / wordpress.com site or page , there is no idendity verification ( as , for example , in twitter ), 
   i seriously doubt turks and greeks can cohabitate . 
  we did for a very long time . 
   we 're just too different . 
  not really . 
  i 've felt very much at home in istanbul . 
  you ca n't live together for 400 years and not have some cultural elements exchange . 
  we drink the same coffee , we eat the same d\u00f6ner ( well , our has pork in it , but the principle is the same ) , i do n't think we 're all that different . 
   the culture in the islamic state [ ... ] i 'm not really sure the `` islamic state '' qualifies as a culture . 
   we have n't really had that much of a problem with things like this yet sadly , it 's just a sign we 're doing a good job ... 
  to whoever ( i 'm guessing the op ) thought to post a rebuttal by reporting / u/slyratchet : 1 . 
  do n't do that , the report button is n't a pm or [ / r/europe 's modmail ] ( / message/compose ? to = / r/europe ) . 
  we ca n't reply to the report !, 
  report something that breaks any of [ reddit 's site rules ] ( / rules / ) , the [ rediquette ] ( / help/reddiquette ) or [ / r/europe 's community rules and guidelines ] ( / r/europe/wiki / community_rules ) . 
  a large portion of redditors will never visit the imgur link to find out about the source . 
  it 's simple to put a top level comment and post the source . 
  the post will remain removed until a top level comment from the op clarifies the source ( i.e. 
  `` source : `` pariser plan . 
  paris : moullier & dermont , oktober 1940 . 
  37x52 cm , a history of the twentieth century in 100 maps / collection of tim bryars .

  what is battlelog and what does it have to do with / r/europe ? 
  i 'm removing this until we get a proper answer . 
  i 've removed this , because apparently you wanted to make a text post ( click on '' [ submit a new text post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/submit?selftext=true ) '' on the right ) , and linking to `` www '' instead is going to be confusing for other users . 
  one of the most wonderful things i 've seen was when there was graffiti on your walls , advocating the use of `` 8.8.8.8 '' 2 . 
  did n't get `` 8.8.8.8 '' get blocked after that though ? 
  it is already approved, 
  ok , so your title is indeed better than the original . 
  still , it does n't exactly represent the content of the video .
