`` the eu has never been hit by such a high number of different crises of this gravity , '' he continued , referring to the migration problem , the rise of terrorism , and the bloc 's persistent economic malaise . 
  `` what i am concerned about is that , although the eu has developed itself historically through a process of crisis , response to the crisis , and advancement , this time around it may well not happen . ''   monti 's skepticism over the wisdom of jean monnet -- who famously said that `` europe will be forged in crises '' -- stems from his low opinion of national governments and the body that represents them in the brussels ' pantheon : the european council . 
    having himself been in the eu 's executive branch -- as both commissioner for the internal market and more famously as competition czar , and then as prime minister of italy in the european council -- monti is clear on where the fault lies . 
    `` nobody could seriously pretend that the full-time eu institutions [ the commission , parliament , european central bank , and european court of justice ] are the ones responsible for the lack of adequate and timely responses to the present constellation of crises , '' he said . 
  `` that is the council , in particular in its highest formation , i.e. , the european council . ''   while he was in office , monti 's critics often charged that his training as an academic economist and his technocratic bent meant he was n't as skilled as the `` professionals '' in the dark art of politics . 
    but today , perhaps because he is largely out of the fray after a disappointing showing in the 2013 italian elections , monti is crystal clear on what 's gone wrong at the pinnacle of eu decision making . 
    `` i think the turning point was the financial crisis , which coincided with the french presidency of 2008 , '' he said . 
  `` the problem of the day was rescuing the banks and even rescuing states to some extent . 
  that was to be done with money from member states , not from the tiny eu budget . 
  therefore , it was inevitable that the power largely shifted from the commission to the council and , within it , to the top table , the european council . ''   in his view , the council 's rise to prominence has been coupled with the steady drift of national political discourses towards nationalism , populism and a focus on the short-term . 
  `` the degree of mistrust and sheer prejudices between north and south and between east and west has never been so high and so unashamedly voiced , '' he said . 
  http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-07-29/greece-isn-t-a-morality-tale  greece is n't a morality tale by mark buchanan   one of the more troubling elements of the recent drama over greece 's debt was the urge by many to see a deficiency of national character , rather than euro-zone economics , as the problem . 
  right-leaning opinion , not only in germany but around the world , put the trouble down to greek corruption and , worse , laziness : the bad people of greece retire too early and produce less per capita than the european average , despite working longer hours . 
    we should n't conclude much of anything from such comparisons . 
  it 's a complete myth that economic productivity somehow reflects the average ability of people to work hard . 
  it has far more to do with the nature of industries in different nations , and how technology has changed their productivity over time . 
    nearly 20 percent of greek economic output comes from tourism , which is natural enough , given the nation 's surpassing beauty . 
  aside from the internet making it easier to book and advertise trips , however , tourism remains a labor-intensive activity not that different from 30 years ago . 
  people take planes and taxis , stay in hotels , eat meals , listen to music and take excursions on boats . 
  all of that requires a large number of people to cook and serve , entertain , clean rooms and drive taxis for long hours . 
  the amount of these things that can be produced per hour and per person has n't changed a lot with time . 
    compare that with , say , the german automobile industry . 
  according to eurostat data , the total output of the european motor-vehicle industry -- german companies account for about half of it -- grew in the decade before the financial crisis by about 4.4 percent a year . 
  that corresponds to a doubling of output in 15 years . 
  much of this increase came from gains in manufacturing productivity -- value created per hour of work -- which in germany , according to oecd numbers , grew by 40 percent over the same period . 
    in other words , rapid economic growth in germany and other fast-growing , developed nations has come mostly from improvements in industrial efficiency , not from some morally superior character of the workers in those nations . 
    all this links up with a notion that economists call baumol 's cost disease , originally proposed by william baumol and william bowen in the 1960s . 
  why , they wondered , do some things like education , medical care and live musical performances get more expensive with time , while so many other things , like manufactured goods , get cheaper ? 
    the answer is simply that productivity improves faster in some industries than in others . 
  as auto manufacturers make ever more and better cars -- faster and with fewer workers -- they can sell them more cheaply and still afford to raise wages . 
  in contrast , a live orchestral performance today takes as long and demands as much skilled labor as it did two centuries ago . 
  getting good musicians requires wages that rise as fast as elsewhere in the economy , and so prices in `` stagnant '' sectors of this sort go up relative to others . 
    this dynamic is a significant contributor to relentlessly rising medical costs around the world . 
  medical technology certainly drives productivity improvements , but time-consuming individual interactions between doctors and patients remain necessary . 
  doctors ca n't give high-quality health care to more patients in one hour today than they could a few decades ago . 
  prices rise , but not because doctors are getting lazy . 
    getting back to greece : it 's no surprise that the productivity per capita of its tourism-heavy economy has n't kept up with germany 's industrial juggernaut . 
  these are different economies supplying different kinds of goods . 
  before 2010 , greek productivity per capita was stable at a level of about 93 percent of the european average . 
  productivity in greece only plummeted after 2010 , following the imposition of severe austerity . 
    here 's the simple , amoral story of greece and germany : one economy thrives on rapidly advancing industrial technology , the other on valuable economic services that get created and delivered in ways that just do n't change a lot with time . 
  the greeks are n't lazy , and the euro zone 's problems have nothing to do with anyone 's moral shortcomings . 
  not exactly . 
  having an manufacturing industry is far more easier to make it more productive . 
  while in greece the biggest sector is tourism ( which is labour intensive ) , and in the tourist indistry you just ca n't make it more productive that easier . 
  well europe used to have some values : http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/10/refugee-crisis-turkey-deal-europe-values, 
  of course at some point the state ( me and you ) will not have the money for bailing anyone or any bank . 
  so everyone will go down in either case .

  lol, 
  concluding paragraphs of the introduction :  what should we conclude from all this ? 
  one clear message that emerged from this conference , particularly from contributors who have a good inside knowledge of the implementation of european economic policy , is that economic policy decisions are heavily affected by political and legal factors and processes , combined with conflicting economic preferences driven mainly by self-interest , but also by traditional views and different perceptions about ` debt ' . 
  germany , being clearly the economic , but also to a large degree the political , ` hegemon ' in this european union , inevitably bears the greatest responsibility for europe 's policy responses to the 2007 global financial crisis and the subsequent eurozone crisis . 
  in the german political ( and to a lesser extent academic ) establishment , there is a preference for structural reform over demand management and a strong opposition to both debt relief and debt itself and these reflect perceived german national interests as well as specific economic perspectives . 
  these preferences have in turn had a major influence on the policy response to the recent financial and eurozone crisis and may fully explain the economic indecision and political stalemate that has characterised european economic policy in recent years . 
   therefore , one clear conclusion from all this is that europe has an urgent need for further debate and discussion that will help identify the economic policy and legislative reforms that need to be introduced in order to ensure that european economic policy will always place eurozone-wide interests above national interests and perceived national populist views and traditions . 
  we hope this small volume will contribute to this debate . 
  after brexit , i wa n't a map without the british colonization and influence regarded as europe . 
  well cyprus was british : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_cyprus, 
  most probably this tram is a [ siemens ] ( http://www.spoudmet.civil.upatras.gr/2003/pdf/05_02.pdf ) one . 
  i will just leave this here : http://www.mfa.gr/en/fyrom-name-issue/, 
  `` an internal rule of an undertaking which prohibits the visible wearing of any political , philosophical or religious sign does not constitute direct discrimination , '' the eu 's court of justice ( ecj ) said in a statement . 
  before the ottoman empire , it was the byzantine , before that the roman and before that the greeks . 
  so by following your mentality , we still should be called the greeks !, 
  i think that from the beginning of the issue , the official greek position was : a compound name with a geographical qualifier before the word `` macedonia '' , which will be used in relation to everyone ( erga omnes ) , for all uses domestic and international . 
  all the above points are written into an [ accord ] ( http://www.mfa.gr/images/docs/fyrom/interim_accord_1995.pdf ) signed by both countries . 
  the actions of fyrom show that the do n't follow the obligations resulting from this accord . 
  the point being made by the mfa , is that fyrom does n't follow the basic rules for being a respectable member of the un . 
  so if it is difficult for the un , will it be easier for the eu ? 
  for the very least he spoke [ greek ] ( https://www.quora.com/what-language-did-alexander-the-great-speak ) . 
  it is the same country the usa . 
  eu is not going to became [ united states of europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_of_europe ) any time soon . 
  respect for good neighbourly relations , sovereignty and territorial integrity, 
  well the one side is acting a lot of disgracefully :  in the time that has elapsed since the signing of the interim accord , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia has systematically violated the letter and spirit of the accord , as well as the obligations deriving from it :   * by promoting territorial designs against greece through the portrayal on maps , in school books , in history books , etc. , of greek territory as being within the territory of a `` greater '' former yugoslav republic of macedonia , in violation of articles 2 , 3 , 4 and 7.1 ;   * by supporting irredentist claims and inciting nationalistic feeling within greece , in violation of article 6.2 ;   * by using the name `` republic of macedonia '' in international organizations -- including the united nations -- that it has joined under the condition that it use the provisional name `` former yugoslav republic of macedonia '' , in violation of the relevant commitments provided for in article 11.1 ( even from the podium of the 62nd un general assembly , the then-president of the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , branko crvenkovski , stated that `` the name of my country is and shall remain the republic of macedonia '' ) ;   * by using symbols -- including the vergina sun and other symbols that are part of greece 's historical and cultural heritage -- the use of which is prohibited under article 7.2 of the interim accord . 
  other instances of this violation include the renaming skopje 's airport `` alexander the great '' , the raising of statues of alexander the great and philip ii , and naming the section of corridor x that passes through the former yugoslav republic of macedonia `` alexander the macedonian '' , construction of the `` porta macedonia '' arch , the surface of which bears carved reliefs depicting scenes from ancient greek history and the vergina sun , as well as express reference to `` aegean macedonia '' , raising of monuments in katlanovo and tetovo adorned with the vergina sun , raising of monuments in gevgelija , in the municipality of gazi baba , skopje , with depictions of the vergina sun and maps of `` great macedonia '' . 
    * by taking or tolerating provocative actions that incite hostility and fanaticism , including desecration of the greek flag and substitution of the nazi swastika for the christian cross , harassment of greek businesses , businesspersons and tourists , etc. , in violation of article 7.1 , irredentist slogans shouted by former yugoslav republic of macedonia supporters at international sporting events , actions both provocative and insulting to greece at the carnival of vev\u010dani , which is funded by the culture ministry of the former yugoslav republic of macedonia . 
    a fundamental principle of every negotiation between states is that the involved parties must negotiate in good faith and a constructive spirit , and exhaust every possibility of reaching a compromise solution . 
  i can see why this is a popular view . 
  but this is a difference between fights between siblings , the others have to see their arguments and go into the `` debate '' . 
  the last thing you want to have is a conflict in a messed up area like the balkans where everything is mixed . 
  it is n't luck that the region gave it 's name to a [ mixed salad ] ( http://www.thefoodsection.com/foodsection/2006/05/salade_macdoine.html ) . 
  you forget about [ nationalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonian_nationalism ) , and there are [ territorial concerns ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonia_naming_dispute#territorial_concerns ) . 
  these concerns should be cleared before proceeding in any eu talks . 
  more info : [ red cross ] ( http://www.redcross.ca/about-us/about-the-canadian-red-cross/red-cross-emblem ), 
  nope . 
  it is important . 
  and the example with the red cross is totally wrong . 
  [ red cross is not for hospitals ] ( http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-red-cross-isn-t-for-doctors-hospitals-1093558 ) . 
   the icrc has for long been trying to stop medical establishments and practitioners from `` misusing '' its registered ` red cross ' emblem , which is protected under the geneva convention of 1949 to which india is a signatory . 
  the issue of the name of the former yugoslav republic of macedonia is not just a dispute over historical facts or symbols . 
  it concerns the conduct of a un member state , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , which contravenes the fundamental principles of international law and order ; specifically , respect for good neighbourly relations , sovereignty and territorial integrity .
