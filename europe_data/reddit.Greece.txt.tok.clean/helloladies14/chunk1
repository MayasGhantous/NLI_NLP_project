when anthimos and his crew fucking die . 
  breaking news : * countless tourists are complaining about headaches while being on vacation in greece . 
  [ what i saw from varoufakis back in 2015 is the same proposal that the imf is bringing to the table right now . 
  ] ( https://www.yanisvaroufakis.eu/2015/06/18/greeces-proposals-to-end-the-crisis-my-intervention-at-todays-eurogroup/ ) as for the rest ... i am sure schauble and the other financial ministers are acting like gentlemen and if i remember correctly he was critisized for talking economics ... in the fucking eurogroup . 
  if that is a bad behavior then i rest my case . 
  we are talking about a time that media chose to talk about his leather jacket than the actual point of the whole conversation . 
  the guy was clearly assasinated by the media and by his fellow finance ministers because they had something to gain from it . 
  the financial ministers of europe are pissed with the guy that says that the program they have invested so much political capital in , has failed ? 
  do n't tell me ... !, 
  initially the imf would n't agree to take part at all , so the europeans made some compromise . 
  now the imf agreed to take part so greece can take some money but they will only pay when the greek debt becomes sustainable ( aka europeans give a debt relief ) . 
  so , macron had nothing to do with it . 
  greece not taking the next payout because of imf did the trick . 
  no ... the proposal was 3,5 % primary surplus for many more years . 
  the imf was n't even on board to that and it got lowered down . 
  ** now the imf agreed to take part but will only give money when they believe the debt is sustainable **  `` i will be proposing to the imf executive board the approval in principal of a new precautionary stand-by arrangement for greece , '' imf managing director christine lagarde said . 
  she added that the amount of this program will be `` probably in the range of $ 2 billion '' ** that would depend on debt-relief measures materializing . 
  imf not giving money effect ... let 's stop pretending that macron will come and save the day . 
   rewarded xd, 
   i mean , the fact that with 35k you are poor as fuck signifies the difference in salary . 
  the middle class in us earns minimum 70k per year and while in us it may not be that great due to cost of living where did you get this number ? 
  70k is not the average salary . 
  it 's the average salary for someone with barchelor and mostly at rich states . 
  half of that is the average and the poverty line is at 22k . 
   it also isnt uncommon to live 15-20 years in us then go to another country for retirement or to open a bussiness because your savings will be goddamn huge in these countries . 
  you really overestimate how much the average american is saving . 
  more than 50 % of americans do n't even have retirement savings ( let 's not talk about that ) and only [ 15 % have more than 10k at their bank ] ( https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/229420/average-american-savings-account_large.png ) . 
  add to that student loans , house loans etc and you are fucked . 
   im repeating what i said above . 
  i recognize that the above guy didnt mention healthcare and education but it is still not enough to compensate the enormous gap between the salaries or the financial opportunities that us provides you are wrong . 
  when you need 50k + just for study fees and when a simple [ cancer ] ( https://costprojections.cancer.gov/annual.costs.html ) treatment costs dozens of thousands of dollars , then , it is worth it . 
  let 's not talk about transportation , parks and various other public assets that northerners enjoy . 
   there are multiple programms for poor people . 
  also if you are poor its bad everywhere , not just us let 's put it this way ... a poor person would prefer to live in canada/north europe than us . 
   imagine that 30-35k is being considered a pretty damn good annual income in every european country whereas 30-35k in us barely reaches minimum salary levels . 
  especially if you live in a big city . 
   p.s : talking about income after taxes now ... you do n't even mention the cost of living and the inequality among states . 
  if you live in seattle or new york with 35k you are poor as fuck . 
  i lied . . you are freaking homeless . 
  did you end up in hospital ? 
  how pitty ... we will punish you . 
  [ consider paying 200 fucking dollars for a teddy bear ] ( http://upriser.com/posts/family-fighting-a-474000-hospital-bill-got-charged-200-for-a-teddy-bear ) . 
  now let 's not talk about the marvelous student debts that will follow you for the rest of your life , the working rights etc. . . do you have financial difficulties ? 
  for the society you are `` white trash '' and you will get zero help ... good fucking luck . 
  i would prefer northern europe in a heartbeat . 
   i mean the salaries in all of northwestern europe , except maybe switzerland , are paltry as fuck compared to us you ca n't be that ignorant ... please . 
  the irony ... 
  i know it sounds good but many times gdp is n't an indicator of how well the economy is doing despire what we hear . 
  i hope that it truly means good things for you guys tho . 
  fixed . 
  thx based mod .

  been there at the age of 10 . 
  wonderful place . 
  so ... if you live in athens and you want to go to igoumenitsa ( aka northwest ) ... would n't you say that igoumenitsa is in northern ** and ** western greece ? 
  he means why so many people see it as threat ( 23 -  19 is very close ) . 
  or at least that 's what i understand . 
  ok ... so if you had to seperate europe based on the geographical position of each country , greece would be in western europe ? 
  a ) people do n't view americans that favorably . 
  there are some evidence that the dictatorship of greece in 1967 was supported by the cia . 
  b ) nato did n't help at the invasion of cyprus . 
  c ) nato does n't do anything for the daily violations of the airspace and sea borders by turkey . 
  are n't we in eastern europe ? 
  yeah ... you completely missed the point . 
  i never said that greece is not to blame . 
  did i say otherwise ... ? 
  i argued that the german corporations that do business in greece are not saints . 
  corruption will only get worse with austerity anyway . 
  [ the uncorrupted german corporations ladies and gentlemen ... ] ( https://www.euractiv.com/section/justice-home-affairs/news/ngo-german-firms-mired-in-worst-greek-corruption-scandals-since-wwii/ ) ps . 
  bring back christoforakos or i ll burn all your white socks and sandals . 
   golden dawn did n't offer help only to gd members either . 
  it offered it to anyone who had a greek id . 
  which is obviously a way to gain easy votes . 
  they were/are targeting people that can vote . 
   again , it 's a very common recruitment and community building tactic extremist groups use . 
  the only reason you call it philanthropy is because it 's far leftists doing it and not neonazis . 
  besides that , there is literally no difference . 
  you sound like you did n't really read what i said . 
  immigrants wo n't help anarchists . 
  they offer nothing to their cause since they are not here to stay . 
   if you want philanthropy , go offer social support without any political posturing . 
  that would be philanthropy . 
  i have done it myself and it helps a lot of people . 
  know what i did n't do when i did that ? 
  i did n't wear a nd pin and tell people how awful socialism is while doing it . 
  yeah that 's fair , but since they are not hurting anyone and helping everyone i do n't see the problem . 
  yeah ... you ignore some crucial things . 
  there is a huge difference between what golden dawn or any other far-right group is doing with anarchists . 
  they are helping immigrants that offer nothing to their cause . 
  they wo n't join them , they wo n't vote for them , they wo n't help them and they will probably never see them again . 
  what you call `` targeting '' in the case of anarchists is what i call philanthropy . 
  they have occupied a building next to my house . 
  if you ignore the fact that the music they play is terrible , they are fine . 
  i often see them carrying sandwitches and juice and distribute them to homeless people . 
  i do n't expect people here to say `` well done '' tho . 
   greece can ask for any interest rate it wants for its government bonds . 
  it 's just that nobody will buy it at the low levels . 
  that 's just a matter of supply and demand . 
  it also has nothing to do with them having euro - it 's because they overspent and crashed their economy . 
  in any case ecb is actually offering them money at below market rates .
