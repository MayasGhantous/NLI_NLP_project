i only just read your reply . 
  three days on , it looks like this might backfire for him and his reaction says he had n't really thought it through . 
  well , that was disgraceful . 
  it looks like samaras wants to push for elections . 
  it 's the only scenario i can think of . 
  rtfa . 
  a lifetime ban from the national teams .

  i will entertain your idea , courtesy of my no-troll-left-behind initiative , and answer that a black man making the nazi salute would be way too funny for anyone to think about punishment . 
  i ca n't argue that the punishment is not severe , but i do think political context is important here . 
  while 10 years ago golden dawn supporters where considered a joke - not to be taken seriously , their recent parliamentary representation has in a way legitimized this ideology in the minds of a few public figures , who feel there is something to be gained from vocalizing their ideas of hate and intolerance . 
  so in this context , i believe the state is right to be more strict in handling such expressions , especially when they come from public figures that have increased influence over children , like football players have . 
  i read his excuse came after his team mates confronted him about it in the changing rooms , which is when i think he understood the full impact this would have \u03bfn his career . 
  one of his early excuses was that he was merely pointing to a spectator friend of his , which sounds laughable , but i still gave him the benefit of doubt . 
  then i saw the video . 
  so , yes , he 's dumb . 
  but not for ignoring the meaning of the salute , but for severely underestimating the consequences , and maybe thinking he 'd find some sort of acceptance from the increasing numbers of extreme right wing supporters . 
  i 'm sure more bans/punishments will follow ; it is , however , relieving to see the federation having suck quick reflexes on the matter .

  it 's not confusing . 
  you just lack the brain damage to understand it . 
  oh and you 're wrong about the cost of living , too [ link ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/rankings_by_country.jsp ),

  i move to england to work and two months later greece is suddenly more competitive . 
  i think s&p are trying to tell me something . 
  you got your wish , greece just pulled out too !, 
  the rich ones live a good life the world over , but how exactly are the greek politicians benefiting from this ? 
  facepalm inducing stuff .

  marching can be exhausting for non-professional soldiers , i 've been there . 
  good man . 
  nothing to ask here . 
  best of luck in your endeavors . 
  i never insinuated court corruption . 
  in fact , i believe the judges made the best out of the shit sandwich handed to them by the angry anti-memorandum mob .

  occam 's razor . 
  no conspiracy necessary . 
  so he had an electronic copy ( meaning potentially thousands of copies held by people all around the world ) and he decides to delete the only three names that would incriminate him , not because they had something to hide , but because it would be an inconvenience . 
  and you 're happy with this version of events . 
  why would he delete the names ? 
  they had nothing to hide and it was later proven that they had nothing to hide . 
  read my words again . 
  it was never ** proven ** . 
  not before you educate yourself on the workings of the justice system . 
  it was never proven that he was the one who deleted them . 
  you need to ask yourself why would he delete the names of 3 people who - it was proven - have nothing to hide ? 
  that was unintentionally painful to read . 
  i 'm pretty sure the citizens voted pro europe a couple of months back . 
  the citizens knew what they 're in for . 
  i know !,

  either the moderator is dead of he thinks i 'm trolling and he is dead . 
  `` how do you feel about migration from within the eu to your country of residence ? '', 
  for greeks the scale should be from `` i do n't find it retarded '' to `` my brain hurts '', 
  i guess this is because it does n't live up to the book , a comparison which for any film is unfair , and more so when the book is by thomas mann . 
  they were expecting a twist . 
  herzog is trully the man . 
  also , death in venice by visconti !, 
  and i soliti ignoti by some other dude . 
  a wonderful comedy remade by hollywood with clooney and rockwell , and as much as i like both actors , the remake felt soulless . 
  those are mere examples though .

  '' ... you gon na love my report on newsnight tomorrow night . 
  please respond to our interview request '' got ta love this tweet . 
  poor grammar , honest disbelief that a greek minister who gave an interview to greek media , has n't answered a request by a foreign journalist , and tops it off with thinly veiled blackmail . 
  i did answer , and i 'm facepalming so hard right now at how you did n't even catch it . 
  half-measures . 
  what we need is a bill encouraging the promotion of the dark ages . 
  just fyi , the fact that this may not be complete bullshit does not fit well with syriza 's narrative , so the fact that you assumed i voted for syriza because i do n't think this scenario was complete bs , shows me you have n't quite worked out what this is about . 
  that 's some heavy editorializing . 
  i profess that holding up signs like this in a civilized society is a form of violence . 
  trigonometry is n't the devil .

  kim kardashian edit : good intentions aside , i think presenting these countries as `` kinda like '' france or germany is a bit insulting and deny them their uniqueness and independent character .
