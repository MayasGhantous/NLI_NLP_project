  if i had n't seen the acropolis in there i 'd be all `` they 're throwing us out , are n't they '' . 
  who are you calling an asshole ? 
  [ context ] ( http://www.thelocal.de/national/20120829-44627.html ), 
   not what i had in mind , but it will do . 
  the green coalition partners might want to reexamine what `` green '' ~ ~ means ~ ~ should stand for . 
  your source is not credible enough for the argument you make . 
  good comment . 
  bwem 's reply is more to the point though . 
  i knew south park is pro toddler murder but wtf is reincarnation propaganda ? 
  edit : do they mean kenny dying in every episode and reincarnating as kenny in the next ? 
  no hickups here . 
  since you 're talking probabilities , there exists the probability that sweden will hand assange over to the cia ( seeing as sweden has done so before ) and make an example of him bradley manning style . 
  this is interesting . 
  so 4 days after the first offence had taken place , the injured party let assange into her home . 
  it was great fun !, 
  i guess the discrepancy between opinions of british viewers and non-british , can be attributed to a heightened sense of pride of the locals during the olympic games . 
  i remember liking the shit out of our ceremony in 2004 . 
  the amount of high-fives and mutual handjobs just for being greek was phenomenal . 
  and then we have countvontroll whose writing is nothing like a troll 's , which in itself is trolling of the highest order . 
  you bring dollars i bring dolmas , we make deal then i put big fat greek wedding in vcr and we enjoy great comedy with messages . 
  you did n't know ? 
  obama said so . 
  he said `` we are going to bail out the greeks with american taxpayer money if it comes to that '' [ link ] ( http://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/19500000/my-little-pony-pink-fairy-castle-80s-toybox-19556283-800-600.jpg ), 
  i think at this point only marklar from the planet marklar have no marklar to marklar . 
  nothing . 
  and not because we 're such a peaceful and friendly people ( which we are ) , but because the germans are still tourists . 
  and tourists spend money . 
  america pay your debts . 
  that has nothing to do with thoughtcrime , nor is it deductive fallacy to deduce that the only upside to the high numbers of africans is that mosquitoes will eat homemade food . 
  however , at this point i find it pointless to continue arguing with you . 
  as i said , you have an axe to grind and i do n't care to be part of it . 
  wow , the butthurt is strong with you . 
  i replied to you an hour after your last comment because i was returning from work . 
  next time you write something about me , be a man about it and let me know , at least . 
  [ jb_uk ] ( https://pay.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/x4xwn/greek_olympian_papachristou_expelled_for_racist/c5j9i3y ) 's comment covers this adequately . 
  [ here you go ] ( http://www.iefimerida.gr/news/60890/%cf%84%ce%b1-%cf%87%cf%81%cf%85%cf%83%ce%b1%cf%85%ce%b3%ce%b9%cf%84%ce%af%ce%ba%ce%b1-%cf%84%ce%bf%cf%85%ce%af%cf%84-%cf%80%ce%bf%cf%85-%ce%ba%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%ad%ce%b2%ce%b1%cf%83%ce%b5-%ce%b1%cf%80%cf%8c-%cf%84%ce%bf-twitter-%cf%84%ce%b7%cf%82-%ce%b7-%ce%b2%ce%bf%cf%8d%ce%bb%ce%b1-%cf%80%ce%b1%cf%80%ce%b1%cf%87%cf%81%ce%ae%cf%83%cf%84%ce%bf%cf%85-%ce%b5%ce%b9%ce%ba%cf%8c%ce%bd%ce%b5%cf%82 ) ( sadly in greek ) . 
  if you need help with the translation , let me know . 
  people are disciplined all the time for not following their organization 's guidelines . 
  if you show up wearing flipflops at work , you may be disciplined for it . 
  it 's not illegal to wear flipflops , but you agreed to follow their guidelines when you signed up . 
  using violence on camera no less , makes them outlaws . 
  you clearly have an axe to grind , but i have little time for that . 
  read up on [ some evidence ] ( http://www.iefimerida.gr/news/60890/%cf%84%ce%b1-%cf%87%cf%81%cf%85%cf%83%ce%b1%cf%85%ce%b3%ce%b9%cf%84%ce%af%ce%ba%ce%b1-%cf%84%ce%bf%cf%85%ce%af%cf%84-%cf%80%ce%bf%cf%85-%ce%ba%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%ad%ce%b2%ce%b1%cf%83%ce%b5-%ce%b1%cf%80%cf%8c-%cf%84%ce%bf-twitter-%cf%84%ce%b7%cf%82-%ce%b7-%ce%b2%ce%bf%cf%8d%ce%bb%ce%b1-%cf%80%ce%b1%cf%80%ce%b1%cf%87%cf%81%ce%ae%cf%83%cf%84%ce%bf%cf%85-%ce%b5%ce%b9%ce%ba%cf%8c%ce%bd%ce%b5%cf%82 ) . 
  so , you 're wrong . 
  it was n't that offensive by itself , but it did bring out several instances of support for kasidiaris and his party . 
  that 's good enough reason for me . 
  not just wishes . 
  she also wrote `` stay true '' . 
  days after the on camera beating . 
   just to remind everyone that golden down is a legitimate political party in the greek parliament . 
  just to remind everyone that back in 1987 , the party 's leader had publicly said the party [ does not support democracy ] ( http://www.iefimerida.gr/news/48267/%ce%bd%ce%af%ce%ba%ce%bf%cf%82-%ce%bc%ce%b9%cf%87%ce%b1%ce%bb%ce%bf%ce%bb%ce%b9%ce%ac%ce%ba%ce%bf%cf%82-%cf%8c%cf%84%ce%b1%ce%bd-%ce%bf-%ce%b1%cf%81%ce%bd%ce%b7%cf%84%ce%ae%cf%82-%cf%84%ce%b7%cf%82-%ce%b4%ce%b7%ce%bc%ce%bf%ce%ba%cf%81%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%af%ce%b1%cf%82-%cf%85%ce%bc%ce%bd%ce%bf%cf%8d%cf%83%ce%b5-%cf%84%ce%bf%ce%bd-%cf%87%ce%af%cf%84%ce%bb%ce%b5%cf%81 ) . 
  they are outlaws . 
  they 're just not in jail . 
  the punishment was not only for the joke itself . 
  the racist undertones are evident once you take into account her past support for the golden dawn party . 
  the thing is she 's not a stand up comedian . 
  she is a representative of my country in an international event . 
  i 've watched hundreds of hours of stand up and i can spot the difference between a professional stand up ( take the recent louis c.k. 
  bit on stewart , full of actually funny offensive jokes ) and half-assed attempts at racism masked as joking . 
  she was n't put in jail . 
  she was ~ ~ reprimanded ~ ~ disciplined by the greek olympic committee . 
  you 're thinking of [ russia ] ( http://rt.com/politics/moscow-city-court-gay-247/ ) . 
  when you 're a vocal supporter of the golden dawn party , it does n't sound as sincere to apologize for one racist joke . 
  kasidiaris is singularly known as that guy who beat up another mp on camera . 
  if he had n't done that , no one would know the name . 
  he 's not in jail yet , and may never get convicted of it , but in my eyes he is guilty of introducing violence in the public discourse , and as such i do n't consider him a defender of democratic values . 
  in endorsing his twits , papaxristou is defending him . 
  i do n't hate her and i 'm level headed enough to know she has n't given these things much thought in the first place . 
  professional athletes are so dedicated and focused on their goal , there is little time to get seriously involved in anything else . 
  having said that , they are the kids ' first role models and need to think twice before touching on sensitive subjects . 
  you mean her affiliation with members of the golden dawn party ? 
  i do n't give a fuck . 
  it does however offer some insight into her motives when she twitted ( tweeted ? 
  twatt ? ), 
  the joke . 
  as for my political beliefs , i do n't belong to any party . 
  i 'm sorry you ca n't categorize me in any of your simplistic stereotypes . 
  [ this ] ( https://twitter.com/papaxristoutj ) is her account . 
  i 'd say it 's the account of an athlete representing greece before anything else . 
  please explain how xenophobic ( you deleted that ? 
  aww ) differs from racist . 
  edit : til haggis gives you ninja-edit superpowers . 
  we live in a world where you can have instant access to an audience of thousands . 
  evidently , she was n't ready for one . 
  she got dumped because , for the olympic games , promoting tolerance and being a role model is considered part of the athletes ' job description . 
  good riddance . 
  she 's only 23 . 
  it 's never too late to educate herself on how to behave when she represents a whole country . 
  very atavistic of you , you cheeky atavist you . 
  for the record , i did n't call your country underdeveloped , i said it gave ukraine a bad name ( which , evidently , it does ) . 
  so taking it out on me seems a bit misplaced . 
  am i supposed to feel insulted ? 
  help me out here . 
  not sure if product of sarcasm or of unevolved primate banging on keyboard . 
  this gives a bad name to ukraine and to people named bill . 
  for me , employment opportunities where the first to go . 
  i 've stayed in the same job 2 years more than i 'd planned for , and i have n't gotten a raise in 3 years ( private sector , engineering , oil & gas industry . 
  the company i work for is doing very good financially , but the climate apparently justifies the freezing of wages , i 'm not bitter about that ) . 
  i still have n't got enough income to live alone . 
  this year i will pay 1500 $ more than last year in taxes .
