  furthermore , my mother will pay 4000 $ more and she will need my support . 
  i have stopped using my car , and go to work using my bicycle and train ( +250 $ / month saved ) . 
  relative to others in greece , the crisis has n't affected me that much , but if things take a turn for the worse , i 'll look for work in some other european country . 
  edit : my salary decreased by 180 $ / month due to increased taxes . 
  how the fuck does one forget * that * of all things ? 
  `` disregard that , i prefer reading to sex '' . 
  next . 
  yeah , have to agree . 
  if you 're gay it should be `` disregard that , i have sex with women '', 
  next time use `` disregard that , i suck cocks '' . 
  it 's way more cathartic . 
  fucking renaissance passed us by . 
  the only instance where german tourists provoked greeks was when they could n't wait to get off the plane at the airport and flew out with parachutes , some time ago . 
  [ krattr 's links ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/wpace/german_tourists_in_crete_didnt_pay_bills_because/c5f9687 ) 3 comments above yours , 18 hours ago . 
  good follow-up . 
  7 % of the electorate seem to think those grandfathers * under * - stayed their welcome . 
  i 'm not sure this is the reason . 
  i do n't know what the reason is , but a good schadenfreude is usually a cause of upvotes . 
  which is why this fighting and reaching out should be thought of as a basic human right when imposing new and more `` effective '' ways of keeping illigal immigrants out . 
  it 's true , many european redditors would benefit from a healthy dose of lightenthefuckup . 
  acting prime ministers rarely do . 
  recognition is usually bestowed by history . 
  go lithuania !, 
  your judgement is clouded by hate . 
  you berate `` right wing fascists and fucktards '' , yet you show similar characteristics of intolerance and hate towards whole ethnicities . 
  good luck with that way of thinking . 
  the fuck is wrong with you , boy ? 
   you 're the exact reason i do n't want anything to do with eastern europe . 
  oops you 're a racist , too . 
   only just control the urge to downvote saved it . 
  only just .

  the n\u00f6rsemen of the apocalypse . 
  heh , that was funny and not void of content . 
  but i guess reddit is serious business for some in r/europe , hence the 15 downvotes . 
  maybe it 's because tourism and shipping have fuck-all to do with innovation . 
  granted , the assumptions i made may not be necessarily true for you . 
  i was making the point that whenever someone berates the elderly for voting x or y it is because they did n't vote for their guy . 
  i , too , hate it when some groups chose the wrong candidate out of tradition or whatever other reason . 
  but the way out of this is not to exclude them from voting , but to promote political debate , through which we may or may not convince them to vote otherwise . 
  it is a slippery slope to open the matter of who votes , for discussion , because today it 's you calling the shots and making rational decisions about who is mentally fit to vote and who is n't , but tomorrow who 's to say some crazy politician wo n't use the same mechanism to take away * your * right to vote citing you as unpatriotic / a communist / gay or even wearing just the wrong shade of purple . 
  i am sorry if i came on too strong , but this argument has been debated a lot lately , and i ca n't stand it . 
  i understood you perfectly the first time . 
  you seem to have issue with the elderly because syriza got the lowest numbers from them . 
  i , on the other hand , have issue with public servants , and the misinformed 18 year olds who ca n't tell their ass from their elbow , who unsurprisingly enough voted for tsipras . 
  we all have opinions , and that 's fine . 
  what gets my goat is when you start questioning the right of representation of other groups , just because your guy lost the election . 
  of course you claim you have more rights than the elderly , when you question their right to vote , and i find this deeply undemocratic . 
  also , abstaining from mesimerianadika and turkish drama , alone , does not make one a political mastermind . 
  but if you want to play the condescending game , for every mesimerianadiko fan who voted for the coalition , i can point you to an equally misinformed slacker working in the public sector who voted for syriza . 
  i think everyone felt their money is safer now than it was the days before the elections . 
  just . . wow . 
  you evidently feel certain social groups need not be represented in a democracy . 
  so different age groups than yours have fewer rights ? 
  why not exclude terminally ill patients too ? 
  they wo n't be around for long . 
  and you know how women can be moody once a month , so lets take them out of the equation , and so on . 
  i find your idea of what democracy is , dangerously skewed . 
  once you light one up . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  it is not inconceivable . 
  i am only saying i understand how having a dozen us secret service working on one man 's case , can make the man jumpy . 
  of course i am not implying they 'll charge him with something petty just to get him on us ground , but it is an informed guess to say that given the resources and efforts dedicated on the man , they are probably building a case against him with the purpose of trying him for it . 
  they would n't waste all this effort by putting the swedes in a position where to extradite him would be contrary to their constitution . 
  they have n't charged him with anything yet . 
  he can be extradited for a parking ticket . 
  this [ icelandic mp ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jul/03/evidence-us-judicial-vendetta-wikileaks-activists-mounts ) begs to differ . 
  he did n't say anything about utilizing talent , which some sectors in the uk would benefit from . 
  all he talked about was restrictions and how to keep greeks out , which resonate more coherently with his right wing voters . 
  whatever !, 
  go use the tevatron for colliding watermelons !, 
  maybe you 'll get lucky and discover a higgs grape amirite guise ? 
  yeah !, 
  next item on the checklist : see * inside * of a black hole event horizon . 
  let 's do this !, 
  you have to take the bosons with the wogans . 
  ( granted , wogan was the best thing about eurovision , but i could n't think of a better eurovision-related word ), 
  take engineering . 
  the uk has a deficit in engineers [ ( pdf link ) ] ( http://www.theengineer.co.uk/journals/1/files/2011/10/5/skills_report_-_september_2011_1.sflb.pdf ) . 
  an immigrant engineer , then , can contribute to the industry by not only creating new jobs , but merely by filling out a position left unfilled by the uk workforce . 
  ooops you 're racist . 
  you want to show you 're in control of the situation ? 
  you say something along the lines of `` in the event greece leaves the euro , we are prepared for the ensuing immigrant flux in such a way as to utilize the talents relevant to our industry , but no more than that '' you want to pander to your far-right racist friends ? 
  you go with `` we 'll keep those dodgy greeks out so they wo n't tk oor jerbs . '', 
  if we start now with the dick-sucking , i shudder to think what we 'll be up to , once the eurobonds are out . 
  is this about the tastelessly named `` kebab murders '' ? 
  ( i could murder a kebab right now hurr durr ) it must be a pretty big deal ; i remember merkel apologizing to the immigrants ' relatives . 
  nice article but your title is a bit misleading . 
  it 's an instrument for studying space alright , but the term space telescope is usually reserved for telescopes we launch into orbit ( hubble , jwt , kepler etc ) . 
  i saw the budget was 7 mil and i thought to myself wait a minute , the jwt will cost americans 8 billion , are we * that * much more efficient ? 
  letters : stop reading there . 
   health issues was just a smokescreen . 
  his health issues are real and quite serious . 
  he wanted the job by the way , or else he would have declined right off the bat , as many did before and after him . 
  it 's not atypical , and to me it does not seem the troika had any say in it . 
  as probabilities go , there 's a bigger chance he will be competent if he is n't a party member voted in parliament . 
  technocrat . 
  blame watergate-gate for that one . 
  while it would be ridiculous to insinuate there was a german underlying plan to make a profit out of the greek bail out , it still is a strong argument against the idea that the bail out cost the german citizens dearly .
