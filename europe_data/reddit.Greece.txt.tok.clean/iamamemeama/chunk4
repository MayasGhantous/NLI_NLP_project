  our track record against thieves is actually pretty good . 
  bar the odd english lord . 
  no kidding . 
  and people who voted for the other guys will never realize that the promise for a re-negotiation of the memorandum was a lie . 
  same as what happened last time . 
  they will have to put up with whatever is thrown at them . 
  back to the pile !, 
  greece fly your jets ? 
  something along those lines . . 
  the idea that we are the hardest workers in the world . 
  people always forget the ~ ~ japanese ~ ~ jamaicans . 
   this was the best possible outcome for him , and he knows it . 
  the count knows what 's up . 
  how about nobody gets fucked , and we debate like grown fucking men . 
  if you troll on my motherfucking thread it better not be some inane shit and paypaydebtmos is actually pretty funny . 
  my point was that if we are to make sense of what happened , we need to talk about hard numbers and not personal experience . 
  i understand your reply is directed to both this comment and the one i 'd made earlier about vathy pasok . 
  it would be silly to assume that the remaining 10 % who are pasok supporters and members are the embodiment of all that is good on this world , but it is self evident that syriza run on a platform that moved quickly to fill the void left by a pasok governance that alienated 3/4 of their voters . 
  it 's not micro-political bullshit . 
  pasok would be elated to have syriza in the coalition . 
  not because of their fresh ideas , but because they know a strong opposition will make the necessary reform next to impossible . 
  well , there 's the rationale that syriza should n't be - was n't - expecting \u2265 151 seats . 
  so realistically all they could hope for was a coalition . 
  you say syriza and nd positions are totally different . 
  assuming you believe nd and pasok positions are very similar , can you tell me on realistic scenario in which if syriza came in first , they would form a coalition ? 
  not the whole ticket . 
  you only get an `` election discount '' . 
  now , there are political parties that pay ( at least they did back in the siemens days ) for 100 % of the transportation , but that goes on the party 's tab , not the state 's . 
  all we need now is a loan from you guys to buy the referee . 
  ah , and so the grandstanding begins . 
  my take is that the three parties want to be seen as negotiators and not mere enablers of the coalition . 
  if syriza was first , they would have to give it a go . 
  now that they came in second , they seem very reluctant to take part in a coalition , and instead feel at home as the major opposition party . 
  this is - imho - a cop-out , albeit an expected one . 
  this is what was initially said , but it now seems a coalition without syriza is the lesser evil when compared to a third election . 
  nd pasok and dimar seems most likely . 
  nah , a path to the dark side kicking people in the box is . 
  i went to the woods instead , and kicked innocent squirrels like a good jedi . 
  it is definitely not a proper singular party . 
  it is comprised of 12 '' \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03c9\u03c3\u03b5\u03c2 '' ( * vectors * i guess comes close ) . 
  as recently as a year ago , one of these vectors ( \u039a\u039f\u0395 - communist organization of greece ) was calling for immediate withdrawal from the eurozone . 
  smiley 's claim was that most pasok supporters ( i leave the `` hardcore corrupted '' out because it is unprovable ) who did n't vote for pasok the second time ( lets call them old pasok voters ) , voted for nd . 
  the numbers from the analysis i posted show that 13.4 % of old pasok voters voted for syriza , compared to 8 % who went to nd . 
  anecdote time : a friend of mine voted for syriza and upon asking if she was afraid we may revert to the drachma , she replied that her mom convinced her to get her money out of the country . 
  not going to happen . 
  the first party gets a +50 seat bonus which puts them way ahead of the rest , therefore a coalition without the first party will be very weak . 
  as for your second point , [ more pasok voters ( from the previous election ) supported syriza than they did nd ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pxzrb21arty/t94vadiukai/aaaaaaabdqs/mln7e66hvw4/s1600/image.jpg ), 
   what are they smoking in pasok ? 
  i would n't be too quick to dismiss pasok as ents  they have first hand experience of the results of irresponsible opposition by the kinds of syriza/kammenos ( `` if you sign the memorandum you wo n't be able to get out of your houses '' or the more colorful `` if you sign the memorandum you 're bound to leave the country by night '' ) and they know that if syriza does not take part in a coalition government , the result will be very unstable and we 'll have elections again in a few months time . 
  pasok does n't want syriza in the coalition for their bright ideas . 
  they just know they ca n't win against a populist opposition . 
  it 's not propaganda . 
  it 's widely accepted fact . 
  [ link 1 ] ( http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_columns_2_03/06/2012_484334 ) [ link 2 ] ( http://press-gr.blogspot.gr/2012/05/127.html ), 
  actually it 's the other way around . 
  '' \u03b2\u03b1\u03b8\u03cd \u03a0\u0391\u03a3\u039f\u039a '' ( \u03b2\u03b1\u03b8\u03cd = deep ) is what we call that ( big ) part of the pasok party that is responsible for the clientelism of the past , instating a large number of party members that run the state in all levels of administration . 
  exactly . 
  170 seats were barely enough last time . 
  honest question : can you tell me the scenario that will keep you in greece ? 
  the running joke before the elections was keep your elderly at home or they 'll vote for the old parties . 
  well , it looks like we kept the wrong age group locked up . 
  nd , pasok , dhmar is the likeliest of the permutations , but i ca n't see the resulting government functioning correctly with syriza in the opposition , seeing as they have most of the public sector on their side . 
  do n't kid yourself . 
  syriza is the rebranded '' \u03b2\u03b1\u03b8\u03cd \u03a0\u0391\u03a3\u039f\u039a '' . 
  this is a very effective way of convincing the reactionary part of the remaining undecided 9 % to vote for tsipras . 
  / thread, 
  do n't avoid greece ( or any other european country for that matter ) only because you 've heard there 's political unrest . 
  the image conveyed across the atlantic is often exaggerated . 
  nice one . 
  so their manifesto is laughable and syriza will do a 180 . 
  i guess i 'm fine with it , but just take a minute to ponder how cynical this sounds . 
  tsipras is not alone in this . 
  he 's standing on the shoulders of giant cynical bastards . 
  i will , however , thoroughly enjoy tsipras 's magnificent \u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03c0\u03b1 on the 18th of june , as well as the expressions of awestruck syriza supporters who bought into the idea that we can keep the money and get rid of the memorandum . 
   damn sun and fucking beaches ? 
  europe has those , too !, 
  at least for now . 
  it 's not the method i have a problem with . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.marblesreunited.org.uk/content/virtual-reunification ) link may better illustrate what i can not . 
  from wikipedia : to facilitate transport by elgin , the column capital of the parthenon and many metopes and slabs were either hacked off the main structure or sawn and sliced into smaller sections causing irreparable damage to the parthenon itself to which these marbles were connected . 
  [ 35 ] they were not simply removed , they were hacked off . 
  it 's like taking mona lisa 's ears and displaying them on a separate canvas . 
  you 're only excused if you did n't know the elginian marbles are pieces cut off of from the parthenon and not complete pieces of art . 
  i 'm sorry , i thought you knew that much . 
  there is nothing * to * support , i only point out how hopelessly out of context the marbles are in the british museum . 
  are the mummies out of place in the british museum ? 
  they probably are . 
  i have n't been to egypt so i ca n't know . 
  if you think the marbles would * not * benefit from returning to the place they were built for , there 's little more that can be said to convince you . 
  i have n't abandoned it , i progressed it so you can see why the greek state feels we should fight for their return . 
  by your logic , i could go in the british museum tomorrow , steal something , put it in a glass casing with better environmental controls and display it in a greek museum because `` most of the artifacts in museums across europe have been taken from elsewhere '' . 
  so you see , the rights/wrongs are not a separate argument but are intertwined with what we call the marbles ' `` rightful '' place . 
  i am not of the opinion that the greek state should shut up because others wo n't speak up . 
  the act of collecting artefacts is a remnant of colonialism and years of inaction can not right this wrong . 
   and there is no legal case for the return which is why the issue is not debated within court walls , but within the walls of cultural and academic establishments . 
  it 's not the legality that is in question but rather the morality . 
  because it restores a kind of justice that was undone by removing them . 
  why is this such a difficult concept to grasp ? 
   i do n't see why it would add more than seeing the mona lisa back where it originally came from . 
  it does n't add anything more .
