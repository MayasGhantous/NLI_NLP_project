  for me , this reason alone is enough . 
  he wants to eat his baklava without taking off the balaclava . 
  are those depictions of perverse sexual acts ? 
  you dirty filthy tourists . 
  i was only pointing out how context is * more * important here than in the case of other artifacts . 
  i agree that there exists a `` rightful '' place for every artifact and that is its home town . 
  on a totally unrelated note , i miss glasgow . 
  did anyone say pot ? 
   bad wording on my part . 
  it was only a failed joke , essentially saying you 're better off buying a dictionary ( like the rossetta stone was - kinda ) than waiting for the british to hand it over . 
  no need to go medieval on my ass . 
  that 's true . 
  fry was essentially preaching to the choir . 
  having said that , the topic is not really as controversial as the other side wants to present it . 
  i 'd wager that a moon landing denialist would face similar audience hostility in a public debate . 
  get a dictionary . 
  you 'd have to steal the supporting rock too . 
  leave the place flat and you have a case . 
  i agree , i upvoted . 
  i was just adding some info to the discussion . 
  about safety : `` the artefacts held in london suffered from 19th century pollution -- which persisted until the mid-20th century [ 38 ] -- and greek conservators have asserted that they have been irrevocably damaged [ 39 ] by previous cleaning methods employed by british museum staff . '', 
  `` dr ian jenkins , deputy keeper of greek and roman antiquities , remarked that `` the british museum is not infallible , it is not the pope . 
  its history has been a series of good intentions marred by the occasional cock-up , and the 1930s cleaning was such a cock-up '' `` according to documents released by the british museum under the freedom of information act , a series of minor accidents , thefts and acts of vandalism by visitors have inflicted further damage to the sculptures . 
  [ 49 ] this includes an incident in 1961 when two schoolboys knocked off a part of a centaur 's leg . 
  in june 1981 , a west pediment figure was slightly chipped by a falling glass skylight , and in 1966 four shallow lines were scratched on the back of one of the figures by vandals . 
  during a similar mishap in 1970 , letters were scratched on to the upper right thigh of another figure . 
  four years later , the dowel hole in a centaur 's hoof was damaged by thieves trying to extract pieces of lead . 
  [ 49 ] '' [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elgin_marbles ) so this assertion that the british are best at conservation does n't hold much water . 
  venus de milo is a single piece of art whose surroundings offer little in the way of context . 
  the parthenon marbles are all * about * context . 
   i think that if greeks really wanted these items there has been a formal request at least for the past 30 years . 
  a referendum is really not necessary , as i have never met a single greek who does n't want the marbles returned . 
  so , you 're saying the british should come for the rest of the acropolis . 
  preservation of history and all that . 
  [ this ] ( http://nonews-news.blogspot.gr/2012/06/blog-post_7326.html ) ( link in greek ) is the source i took the numbers from . 
  it sucks monkeyballs , but come election day when things have cooled down , i think their numbers will fall back to 3 . 
  . . or were you refering yesterday 's footbal result  ? 
  from 3.2 before the incident ( almost 5 % down from elections ) to 4.1 after the incident for the golden dawn . 
  this whimsical metric invention , called `` limerick '' was not my intention . 
  my past efforts at verse , have proved always adverse in ways too embarrassing to mention . 
  german flag : `` angela merkel is laughing all the way to the bank '', 
  it 's weird for sure . 
  for one thing , politicians are not used to handling these kinds of situations . 
  pavlopoulos ( the other male politician ) later said he did n't get involved because he can not control his strength and he 'd have sent him to the hospital . 
  ridiculous i know , but their passivity is one of disbelief , not of keeping a neutral stance . 
  personally , i think they were afraid to fight a psychopath with a personal army . 
  up until now , the golden dawn party was not invited to televised discussions due to their extremist opinions and total disrespect of democratic principles . 
  this created a void which some journalists have sought to exploit by inviting golden dawn members to their panel discussions knowing full well that they would act on their violent nature and create revenue for their bosses . 
  the dynamics on set are in no way indicative of televised political discourse in greece . 
  you want one gyro ? 
  or 3.000.000.000 drachmas . 
  everyday a new low . 
   two economic scholars , including a former finance minister , who reviewed tax records for the months preceding 13 national elections found a marked drop in taxpayer compliance when government officials are focused on political campaigns and fewer audits are carried out . 
  this is way , way off what the title is suggesting . 
  here 's a concise brief history lesson [ link in greek ] ( http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_columns_2_03/06/2012_484334 ), 
  pasok circa 1981 and pasok circa 2009 are two completely different parties in terms of fiscal discipline and internal structure , so basing your opinion on 1981 politics is completely missing the point . 
   direct influence from ex-members i 've got news for you . 
  those new parties that are all the rage nowadays ( syriza , aneksarthtoi ellhnes ) are partly made up of ex-members of pasok/nd . 
  kammenos was in government from 2004 to 2009 , katseli was minister from 2009 to 2011 ; pasok is no longer the party of trade unionists , they 're backing syriza now . 
  hell , syriza even employs associates of disgraced former defense minister tsoxatzopoulos . 
  these new parties everyone is so eager to defend are effectively just a re-branding and recycling of political figures of the establishment . 
  as for the ones that did n't come from pasok/nd , the signs are disheartening to say the least . 
  on the right you 've got - among others - the doctor who sued the papandreou government for high treason , washed out journalists and actors . 
  on the left you 've got the standard variety of uninformed party members rhetorically asking where 's the harm in making our transactions in drachmas instead of euros , or promising a fresh influx of workers into the public sector . 
  good luck with that . 
  fox news : europe still gayest place on earth . 
  just buy them some cows on farmville . 
  that should keep them inside . 
  if you 're one for acting on signs , then i 'd say start packing . 
  sign 1 : we 're on the ** brink ** sign 2 : the country 's about to go full ** retard ** sign 3 : ** \u039a\u03b1\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1\u03c2 ** was voted in parliament, 
  oh thank god that was a typo and not one of those horrendous new words like grexit , or euranus . 
  ( ok , i made that up ), 
  no , kudos to the players . 
  it was a good day for the underdogs . 
  we played to our strengths and if you were n't watching for the beauty of the game , there was a lot fun to be had . 
  all in all , 9/10 , would win like that again . 
  time for greece seems a bit off . 
  i find a discrepancy between your link and [ this ] ( http://www.eclipseafrique.com/index.php?section=118-center-transit-of-venus-of-june-05-06-2012-center ) one . 
  i cheer for greece because we once won the euro without having played actual football , and that 's admirable . 
  so you belong to the 30 % of self-employed workers in greece . 
  because the other 70 % in which i belong , do n't / ca n't avoid taxes . 
  shut up . 
  clearly , what we should do is legalize animal marriage , export mangos to afghanistan , and vote the color [ # 00ff0f ] ( http://www.colorhexa.com/00ff0f.png ) for president of everything . 
  ~ ~ a quick search yielded this but i 'm afraid i have no first hand knowledge of the place . 
  if you do however end up there , it 's only a few km drive to kalamata where i try to spend most of my summer weekends , so beers are in order ! ~ ~ i read phlos :|,

  what this comment needs as a reply is a -----  [ ** boob link ** ] ( http://img.waffleimages.com/759eae42a632010104df98098bb7876514f62d54/iss4009_feature_girl_busty_boobs_05_.jpg ) < ----- to divert the attention . 
   unemployed and homeless , searching for scraps of food in garbage , the church has always been quick to help . 
  yes , it 's great that the church provides scraps for the homeless to find . 
  the orthodox church is a bunch of greedy state-supported money grabbers , who have been amassing wealth for decades . 
  5 soup kitchens are n't enough to convince me they 're doing their part , when the church is exempt from property tax . 
  as for the church 's support for the golden dawn , please read [ this ] ( http://neoskosmos.com/news/el/node/22626 ) ( link in greek ), 
   if a member of a club does not respect the rules , it 's better that it leaves the club , and this is true for any organisation or institution or any project . 
  ignoring the idea that baroso said something he did not believe in , just because papadimos asked him to , are those really words that can throw financial markets into panic ? 
  syriza members have made statements far more alarming to the markets than this . 
  doc called it . 
  back in our holes errybody !, 
  being right and being corrupt are not mutually exclusive . 
  so . . what did you vote for ? 
  i voted to acquit , but i must confess it was n't an easy decision as both sides made convincing arguments .
