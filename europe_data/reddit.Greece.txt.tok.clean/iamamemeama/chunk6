  then my next question would be who * did * you vote for . 
  you see , ** every single person in greece ** ( myself included ) has the conviction that he/she voted for the right candidate . 
  the least corrupt , the smartest , the most noble . 
  it 's when we put them in the same room that we begin to see how shitty/corrupt/ineffective the mixture is . 
  the only antidote to this i can think of , is to cultivate critical thinking in our education system . 
  i guess i 'm just cross because his first trial did n't get much coverage on reddit . 
  maybe xpost it to r/worldnews ? 
  this will be epic . 
  ** the court : ** - lord justice richard aikens , judge , member of the court of appeal of england and wales ( uk ) - sophie-caroline de margerie , member of the conseil d\u2019etat ( france ) - pierre delvolv\u00e9 , member of the academy of moral and political sciences ( france ) - dr. giusep nay , dr.

  edit 2 : so far ( 1 hour in ) it 's been very interesting . 
  not too late to join in , if you have n't . 
  i ca n't hear you over my constant partying . 
  r/europe . 
  come for the cellphone tips , stay for the end of the world . 
  it 's the jews , then the germans , * then * the british . 
  greeks come in at 30th place right behind gay penguins . 
  it 's only going to get worse . 
  i , for one , will hopefully be removing my brain from the collective one in the near future . 
  some , however , would argue that 's a good thing for greece . 
  upvote for truthiness . 
  bitching about your politicians in a democracy is akin to shouting infront of a semi-transparent mirror with the politician behind it . 
  pfff . 
  you have to lead him on , so that his next answer is more outrageous than the last . 
  come on , play the game right . 
  naturally . 
  when you take mass public hanging out of the question , the only remaining option is invasion . 
  everybody knows * that . 
  i like how the answer of 100 % of rageaholics ( both greek and foreign ) is this spaghetti western version of justice i.e. 
  to hang somebody from somewhere . 
  it 's just masked hatred . 
  the fact that bigos asks rhetorically `` what fucking difference does it make ? '', 
  means that the whole land appropriation issue ( i.e. 
  the main reason greece acts this way ) has n't even * occurred * to him . 
  some people would be embarrassed to mouth off based on such an incomplete knowledge on the subject . 
  not this guy . 
  i know , i was just being a smartass . 
  yes , that smear campaign against the friendly romanian communist party of yesteryear is to blame . 
  ironically enough his format is the more accurate , where political discourse is a series of interlaced bullet points rather than something that requires an adequate mental capacity to carry out . 
  i hope you 're not of voting age yet . 
  it is evident how meaningless terms like `` anti-austerity '' and `` pro-austerity '' have become , when a french anti-austerity politician agrees 100 % with a greek pro-austerity politician . 
  it also illustrates how much these terms have corroded the political debate in greece , where once a politician is labeled pro-austerity , everything that comes out of his mouth can be regarded as of little value . 
  as long as we exchange 12s with cyprus , the four horsemen are still a long way away . 
  when commenting in reddit , i have learned to use sarcasm cautiously with people whose first language is n't english . 
  your posts are always a good read . 
  but what about that other thing you forgot to mention ? 
  spot on about the jews . 
  as for the land mines part , it is ridiculous to assume that because a european report on illegal immigration challenges the adequacy of border control , this automatically legitimizes neo-nazi practices . 
  about the jews ? 
  exactly . 
  i ai n't even mad . 
  we 're collectively retarded , but given time , we have the capacity to revert to half-retard . 
  what gets my goat is there are still voters thinking the past 3 years were only a bad dream , and if we say it enough times , we 'll wake up ala life on mars ( not the shitty us version ) , and go back to happy-go-lucky 2008 . 
  do n't feed the troll . 
  the new polls give him 2.8 % which is under the 3 % threshold . 
  nazi denies holocaust . 
  god . 
  it is . 
  reminds me of the final dialogue in burn after reading . 
  - what did we learn , palmer ? 
  - i do n't know , sir . 
  - i do n't fuckin ' know either . 
  i guess we learned not to do it again . 
  - yes , sir . 
  - i 'm fucked if i know what we did . 
  - yes , sir , it 's , uh , hard to say - jesus fucking christ . 
  file under `` inconvenient truths . '', 
   tsipras is seen as wanting to negotiate harder . 
  remember who was in that exact same position 1 year ago ? 
  yeah . . 
  i 'm not trying to be a smart-ass , but facts do little to support the opinion that it 's all down to how good at poker our politicians are . 
  `` sensible '' compared to the brainstorm-gone-wrong that is syriza . 
  it * is * required if the coalition is not keen on starting work with athens burning in the background . 
  if you think about the logical steps that will follow once syriza gets it 's 25 % , voters are sure to be betrayed . 
  either that or tsipras is going to talk sense into merkel with his magical convincing powers , and we will get to stay in the euro without the austerity . 
  i 'm not holding my breath for the second eventuality . 
  the fact of the matter is that pasok and nd tell it like it is because having scored so low in the election , they have nothing to lose . 
  syriza on the other hand is avoiding the issues at best , uttering vague promises when they 're not busy negating ridiculous statements made by fellow party members ( glezos , stratoulis , theopeftatou ) . 
  i agree with you on the part of buying time and the double talk going on . 
  i just do n't think the issue of a 37 % coalition is a mere technicallity . 
  i 'm not the one downvoting you bro . 
  here 's some upvotes for proof . 
  one party can . 
  3 parties with different programs ca n't . 
   because the three of them already had a majority of 168 out of 300 in the parliament . 
  it 's not an excuse . 
  you should read the proceedings of the 13/05 meeting the president had with samaras , tsipras , and venizelos . 
  [ link in greek ] ( http://news247.gr/eidiseis/politiki/ekloges-gr/ta_praktika_ths_suskepshs_twn_arxhgwn.1775781.html ) essentially , 168 members does n't mean shit if the cumulative percentage the 3 parties got in the election is 37 % . 
  edit : what tsipras was looking for when he said `` go ahead and form a coalition without me '' is the day after , when he 'd come out and say what the three parties did is a constitutional coup . 
  a week ago syriza got 25 % in polls , which dropped to 20 % 5 days later . 
  i 'll bet you a beer syriza wo n't do better than second place . 
  if i lose , i 'll pay the beer in drachmas . 
  i firmly believe sensible parties will win the second election . 
  this was the beginning of the end for the false hope parties . 
   can anybody even name what the last great innovation to come out of greece was ? 
  [ eat it , bitch ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/nama_machine_d%27anticyth%c3%a8re_1.jpg/280px-nama_machine_d%27anticyth%c3%a8re_1.jpg ), 
  pasok cheated in the election ? 
  even for an accusation-happy country such as ours , this is a new one . 
  how ? 
  a coalition without syriza is not possible because the resulting government would be very short lived .
