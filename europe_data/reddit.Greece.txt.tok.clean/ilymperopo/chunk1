hi czech mates , in greece we already call you czechia ( ** \u03a4\u03a3\u0395\u03a7\u0399\u0391 ** ) . 
  actually , when i am speaking english it randomly occurs that i refer to your country as `` czechia republic '' . 
  i do n't think this is as bad as it may sound . 
  what is sold is of course the port management ( infrastructure , logistics , administration ) , which is quite common . 
  moreover , the part that cosco already owned in the port has seen its numbers bloom the last years , making it one of the largest container ports in the mediterranean . 
  many companies ( like hp ) are setting up their logistics centers near the port due to such developments and we badly need those investments if we want our economy to grow . 
  hmm , romanian citizenship encompasses more ethnicities than simple romanians . 
  the one that knows that testing your ideas breads a better understanding of the world and lets them evolve into a more resilient form . 
  the other way , that of being oblivious to the ideas of others , is fanaticism . 
  i do n't think this is a sound strategy . 
  i do n't understand why this is the best way to part with an important country , except for intimidating the rest of the states in case they have similar thoughts . 
  making fun and trolling him , simply . 
  would n't you laugh in the blabbering of a politician trying to persuade you by mixing things and concepts that do n't match ? 
  quality control and standards for germans . 
  you would think there is some geopolitical play behind it oh , wait . 
  but then who is the decider that can overthrow a popular vote ( the very law maker of the country ) and why should there be any popular vote in the first place since there already exists such an accurate decider . 
  and why u-turns are by default bad ? 
  if this was perceived as a bad situation , why should you turn slower ? 
  and who decides the speed of the turn ? 
  it is true that there is lenience from police officers for over-speeding , especially if you speak well and accept your fault they will most probably deduce 10-15km / h from your speed ticket . 
  if you start making remarks about why they do n't spend their time searching for the `` true criminals '' they will probably search and find every minor regulation your car does not abide to . 
  but bribery for these issues is almost unheard of , you could run into serious troubles . 
  or else it 's economy would lose 25 % of gdp , its debt would skyrocket to 175 % , unemployment would reach a record 25 % and non-performing loans would go as high as 40 % . 
  phew , that was a close one . 
  thanks , that bail-out plan worked . 
  i would prefer milano , [ seems well protected from ground forces ] ( http://www.georelief.de/isotope/d/detail2-4280000664372_big.jpg ) at least . 
  far away from the sea as well . 
  the alps and the apennine could be reinforced with anti-aircraft missile systems . 
  finally , still very close to the population centers of eu . 
  impenetrable . 
  they were not expelled from greece in order for the other side to keep the population of greeks in constantinople intact . 
  which they did n't . 
  looking at the initial region they occupied , it is difficult to believe that all those people living in the surrounding areas become `` turks '' . 
  the cultural and religious assimilation was however tremendous . 
  it is quite difficult to grasp what made the ottoman idea so successful given that they did not start from a grand empire . 
  gib smyrna back ( if we split territories why not start from our westernmost point towards your easternmost point and find the middle line ) . 
  this is a phrase of pericles , the great ancient athenian statesman , here a discussion on its meaning from an etymological [ website ] ( http://lexilogia.gr/forum/showthread.php?4621-%ce%bc%ce%ad%ce%b3%ce%b1-%cf%84%ce%bf-%cf%84%ce%b7%cf%82-%ce%b8%ce%b1%ce%bb%ce%ac%cf%83%cf%83%ce%b7%cf%82-%ce%ba%cf%81%ce%ac%cf%84%ce%bf%cf%82 ) ( alas , mostly in greek , but with english translation of the ancient text ) i think your translation captures best the original meaning , though with such delphic sayings , one should always insert his personal viewpoint , upon which his life shall depend . 
  as is known . 
  maybe the commission should directly tax such cases for its own budget , depriving ireland of the benefit of $ 13 bn . 
  after all , the puny eu budget of 155bn could get some help . 
  is n't a 12.5 % tax rate a good enough incentive when most of europe has at least double that ? 
  a below 0.1 % effective tax rate sounds very fishy ( not only a policy decision ) . 
  they are not even pinpointing a contradiction , but an omission . 
  they are helping the commission to collect more taxes for the benefit of other jurisdictions . 
  and since ireland has a small tax rate , italy , spain , germany and so on , together with ireland should collect more than 13b . 
   something as hard as 20-30 % of gdp ? 
  i am scared . 
  you need to operate it as well after building it . 
  r/titlegore / needs to talk with you, 
  you essentially reduced vat and the retail sales have increased ? 
  that 's preposterous . 
  do n't tell me that total taxes collected have also increased ? 
  greeks ( and most people ) judge feelings more than absolute objectiveness . 
  but thank you for being generous through your rationalism , in any case . 
  i am not even sure why those norwegian prisons are not totally bankrupt with only 20 % customer retention . 
  some type of scam . 
  yes , but you have 6-times our population , so divide these medals by 6 . 
  ( in other news , i was surprised and proud that we are even in the top-ranking table of the sport ), 
  i do n't think it is so simple as that . 
  on the surface he said that i will start immediately the * process * of extradition . 
  this might mean several years in the courts to decide whether this is legal or not . 
  it was not european law only it is the greek law as well . 
  and we know very well to play with legal technicalities ( legal process in greece lasts a lifetime or more ) . 
  very well perceived in greece , considered an ally ( our prime minister has said that he considers him also a personal friend ) . 
  but , information never goes deeper than that . 
   when criminals in norway leave prison , they stay out . 
  it has one of the lowest recidivism rates in the world at 20 % . 
  the us has one of the highest : 76.6 % of prisoners are re-arrested within five years . 
   a 2007 report on recidivism released by the us department of justice found that strict incarceration actually increases offender recidivism , while facilities that incorporate `` cognitive-behavioural programs rooted in social learning theory '' are the most effective at keeping ex-cons out of jail . 
   as are hoidel , halden prison 's director , puts it : `` every inmates in norwegian prison are going back to the society . 
  do you want people who are angry -- or people who are rehabilitated ? '', 
  would you really say the same if bremain had won ? 
  the result was quite marginal . 
  the fact that you think that `` you know '' what is best for your country , does not mean that another person does not hold the opposite opinion with equal determination and superiority over the `` silly ones '' of your side . 
  this is what democracy is all about . 
  there are not per se superior opinions . 
  the majority decides what gets to happen and if that causes mistakes , the same does happen with `` enlightened '' undemocratic processes . 
  they also do mistakes . 
  the overall trend , and the sense of citizenship and decision participation is what makes democracy great , not cherry-peaking situations were it ( might have ) failed . 
  i think the meaning is lost in the thread . 
  the only thing i am saying is that greece has companies that are doing very well in the aforementioned sectors . 
  sure , i could not agree more with you on the inefficiency and business unfriendliness of the public sector . 
  ( btw no shipping company pays any significant tax anywhere in the world ), 
  at least now we have an excuse, 
  for example , [ athens international airport ] ( https://www.aia.gr/company-and-business/the-company/facts-and-figures ) has been always profitable . 
  [ port of thessaloniki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/port_of_thessaloniki ) as well . 
  [ mytilineos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mytilineos_holdings ) in energy and power plant construction is quite strong . 
  a common misconception is that the greek economy is bad . 
  while this might be true for the state and state financials , the private sector has been always very prosperous ( at the expense of the state many times nonetheless ) . 
  take for example greek shipping which controls a significant part of the world fleet ( close to 1/6th ) . 
   there is also a problem with transportation . 
  the water polo team missed a practice session because the bus driver could not find the way to the training center . 
  my bad !, 
   well , not in greece , of course , but in europe . 
  greece has many successful companies in these sectors ( at least the ones not run by the state ) . 
  i love the wording behind this map : what does modest innovator mean ? 
   but there are plenty of successful airport management , energy production , and port companies . 
  where do you draw this conclusion from ? 
  hey bacanak , do you prefer them to go to some place like egypt or croatia ? 
  at least they stay in the region .
