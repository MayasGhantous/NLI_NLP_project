  they might like it and come to you next year . 
  now , guys , my cousin in kalamata has these amazing rooms to let next to the sea and his mother makes the best mousaka you have ever ... 
  also , that the parking is full of electric chargers, 
  i am glad it 's not france 's putin . 
  this guy is weak . 
  i am glad it 's not france 's putin . 
  this guy is weak . 
  i would not call those `` universities '' in the common definition . 
  most like post-graduate research centers . 
  one has 140 post-graduate researchers , the other 420 . 
  hardly , what would define a european-union university . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_university_institute https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/college_of_europe, 
  someone organized it , and that someone was powerful enough and probably secretive as well . 
  i certainly do n't know the exact details , but this theory is neither laughable nor improbable . 
  what are the other options anyway ? 
  i wonder , since the expenses of the salary do not enter the tax-declaration of the company , if the taxes evaded are approximately offset by the higher taxes that the company has to pay . 
  could this be a mentality or cashflow problem , or even bureaucratic ( firing a regular employee is tough ) than a purely financial one . 
  let 's not forget that the ieo report described in the article specifically mentions  in may 2010 , the imf executive board approved a decision to provide exceptional access financing to greece without seeking preemptive debt restructuring , even though its sovereign debt was not deemed sustainable with a high probability . 
  so , their watchdog is accusing them for not forcing a debt restructuring that would ensure viability , ** before ** entering a loan-agreement with greece and the eurozone . 
  i clearly remember greek politicians arguing against it ( wtf ? ), 
  and dominique strauss kahn discussing it with papandreou ( the prime-minister of greece back then ) . 
  but , the dqk got involved somehow in a strange case ... 
  yeap , you are right . 
  i was taking about eu which is 500m ( well we lost 60m recently ) and eventually all countries will be integrated in the currency . 
  the eu budget also concerns all eu countries . 
  i think you are absolutely right . 
  the eu budget is a total joke ( [ 1/50th ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/explained/myths/myths_en.cfm ) of the eu national budgets ) . 
  people think that `` fiscal transfers '' are bad , and the rich countries would not give their consent . 
  i think , that a good argument is that this opens the market to the richest 500m in the world . 
  for example the net fiscal transfers for germany to the eu budget are 9bn , and their exports towards european countries in the realm of 900bn . 
  i think this is an enormous benefit at very little cost . 
  this implies that the rules are having a positive impact to start with . 
  exactly this , the chinese are more sublime and defer from making grandiose `` virtue '' statements ( still ) . 
  this does not mean that they stay idle and do not engage into subversive action . 
  they are preparing to become a major superpower after all . 
  i think the uproar that this decision would cause ( for such a small violation , after both countries were trying to bleedingly conform to stringe requirements ) probably scared some people . 
  the whole thing looks like a pharse lately . 
  please , can we reduce our ** surplus ** goal down from 3.5 % while our unemployment rate is above 20 % and half the youth of the country departs ? 
  or , pay debts ? 
  for the lulz ( syriza was supporting all occupations , protests , etc - but now is playing the government ) . 
  if you want to know what isis really wants look this insightful article from [ the atlantic ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/03/what-isis-really-wants/384980/ ) . 
  ** tldr ** : to provoke the infidel armies of europe in an open battle : `` the islamic state awaits the army of `` rome , '' whose defeat at dabiq , syria , will initiate the countdown to the apocalypse '' . 
  i can not upvote you more . 
  virtue signaling has become a plague of modern societies and we are seeing its reprecursions ( because it is only signaling and no substance ) . 
  though you present a well thought argument about asylum and its value , it does not take into account the difficulties in implementing it for a large number of people . 
  asylum as a concept was inaugurated at an era when political prisoners were prosecuted in their countries and seeking refuge in others . 
  this was a handful of people ( 100s maybe 1000s ) at most which most european countries could accomodate and shelter without a significant upkeep . 
  this also implied , that this political prisoner was fighting for change and democracy in his country and would return back as soon as things stabilized or the dictator was removed . 
  the eu migration policy is using asylum as a pretext to allow an unprecedentent number of half-documented people to enter its common area without a coherent and long-term plan of how to handle them . 
  especially at a time of stagnating growth and widespread unemployment for many of its own countries . 
  did he ignite terror ? 
  if yes , then he is a terrorist . 
  the fact that a lot of political groups or ideologies use terrorism as their asymmetric weapon towards organized societies does not mean that terrorism is always political or that has an elaborate structure and purpose . 
  there are not always causes behind everything . 
  people make decisions as well . 
  they are conscious beings . 
  this is what evil means , that given all other things equal you took the evil route , the one that is in favor of destruction and degradation of human dignity . 
   and we ( the west ) are financing and selling weapons to its main sponsor . 
  there is no particular reason that we are to blame for doing so . 
  i have been in many advanced societies and i have seen that he that has power will often abuse it if not checked . 
  i do n't think the west has any special tendency towards sponsoring violent groups than islam for igniting terrorism . 
  being born innocent ( by definition ) does not mean that you do n't have the capacity to be violent and evil , or even to be preconditioned to be so - as a normal human being . 
  but besides the stressors , the natural environment and society , there is also personal choice . 
  i am not sure why this is taken so lightly and we accept everything as a huge inevitable machinery of cause and effect . 
  dem fishes, 
  please , cut the silly remarks . 
  what the article reveals is that this is business as usual for rr and not an extraordinary event `` due to brexit '' . 
  given also that rr has not commented on this yet , i would urge you to be more modest in your behavior . 
  just found another [ article ( from 2015 ) ] ( http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-2952895/rolls-royce-announces-profits-warning-currency-hedging-losses.html ) , claiming that they `` lost '' 1.25 bn gbp on their hedging book ( which is something close to 26bn ) . 
   the hedging book has to be ` marked to market ' , in other words , the gain or loss at the time of the accounts must be shown . 
  each year this sends the profit figure lurching in a different direction : in 2013 rolls booked a # 217million gain from hedging and saw a # 747million boost the previous year , but in 2011 it had red ink of # 49million and was forced to book a # 341million charge in 2010 . 
  the whole think is becoming a bit silly , with eurocrats praying for bad news on the british economy . 
  it wo n't happen lads . 
  happy to see some informed and reasonable people . 
  we had similar problems in greece ( and of course they should be eliminated by upgrading the technology infrastructure and governmental processes ) , but nobody cared to check if they were more than 0.3 % of the problem . 
  everyone assumed that those are the problem . 
  i would be hardly surprised if similar things do n't happen to most countries . 
  also , take into account that the greek train operator has been recently bought by the [ italian railways ] ( http://www.railjournal.com/index.php/main-line/greece-accepts-italian-bid-for-trainose-privatisation.html ) which might push for such a development . 
  well , concerning demand , build it and they will come . 
  i am sorry to spoil the fun but most of your numbers are wrong . 
  * most cap beneficiaries receive less than 2000e / year . 
  a meager ** 0.3 % ** of farmers receives more than 100k/year in subsidies . 
  * eu agricultural ** output is 350bn . 
  the cap is 50bn/year ** . 
  * agriculture employees are 7.5 m people . 
  before 10 years this was 10m people . 
  * agriculture is indeed only 1.5 % of eu gdp , though it reaches 4-5 % for some countries . 
  * ** eu budget is really very small ** ( less than 2 % of the total eu national budgets ) , this money is essentially very similar to what the national governments would have done for agriculture if there was no eu . 
  * ** all eu industries are subsidized ** ( by national budgets ) there is something that is called national investment law . 
  germany ( and of course all other countries ) subsidizes capital investments up to 30 or 40 % of the cost .

  euractiv is a politically loaded ngo trying to look ( from appearance and naming ) as something `` official '' . 
  open society ( soros ) , bill and melinda gates , bosch foundation , are funding them . 
  mah linux distros bro, 
  this is too low to be read , but the hard numbers are as follows : research funded by eu is financed by all member states . 
  uk , however , for the 2007-2013 research funds ** gave 5.4 bn eur ** in the common budget and got back ** 8.8 bn eur ** in research grants . 
  now , to paint a more complete picture , the total amount of ** uk financing towards eu budget was 77.7 bn eur ** for the same period . 
  the ** uk received back 47.5 bn eur ** . 
  so , really research is being kind of screwed since they were very succesful in attracting eu research grants compared to how much money the uk was giving . 
  however , it has to be pointed out that this is not an unfixable problem in terms of funding if the uk properly delegates the net money it will not be giving any more towards the eu ( some 30 bn every 7-years ) to close the gap .
