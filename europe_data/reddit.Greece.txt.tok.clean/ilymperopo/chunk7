  there are sectors which have close relationships to the state ( such as infrastructure ) , were national companies are also champions ( see the [ list ] ( http://www.enr.com/toplists/2015_top_250_international_contractors1 ) , where european firms dominate construction ) . 
  the specific example that you are bringing does not seem to hold true anywhere in europe , all trains are locally manufactured or bought by a european manufacturer . 
  more than anything the railway sector involves a lot of regulation and political intervention . 
  i find it hard to be scared that the chinese will win somehow magically many of the rail stock competitions in a european country . 
  the only thing where they have an edge is cheap consumer products and cheap mass produced commodities , and this is not where europe is focusing as a continent , whether nationally or colaboratively . 
  national egotism damages europe , of course , it is a tautology . 
  but europe might be damaging national interests to achieve its goals at its current stage of development . 
  i think you are overstating the importance of pan-european coordination . 
  ariane and airbus succeed because they are heavily subsidized and because europe needs a strategic answer to the aerospace domain , not because it is per se a profitable model of business . 
  country specific businesses ( like siemens or vw , lvmh or luxottica ) succeed internationaly without the need for enforced pan-european cooperation . 
  it is not that there is an american equivalent to tgv that the chinese want , nor that europe has to win in every domain and the chinese to lose in all , to feel not threatened . 
  thanks obama, 
  the high-court of the region decided yesterday , the decision 2-years ago was that of the lower-court . 
  the court ruling would make some little sense in terms of non anti-semitism ( always including the crime of arson and hate inciting violence ) if the attack was against some israeli embassy ( thus the representation of the government ) and not the synagogue , a universal symbol of the jewish people throughout the ages , and an asylum for people in distress that every religious temple represents . 
  nothing for lichtenstein ? 
  why should they accept it ? 
  a country behaves based on its interests and priorities not temporal perceptions of reality . 
  what will happen if they do n't ? 
  well , at least in the provincial greek stereotype the cat belongs to a neibourhood and not to a single household .

  this discussion should never go emotional . 
  no-one has to be thankfull , neither the greeks nor the europeans . 
  this is a common project . 
  there are faults at the design level of the eurozone and the political expansion of europe that have allowed for the shortfalls of a small country ( and some ) to jeopardise the whole institution by revealing to the world its weak spots . 
  a robust organization does not fail at first sight of a problem and europe has not . 
  but if does not pull itself together it does not mean that it will not succumb to the pressures . 
  a common currency like the euro implies something like this and more , but of-course with safe-guards . 
   can anyone imagine greece being able to rack up debt with german credit ... and not be exclusively liable for it ? 
  and this is exactly what happened before the crisis tbh . 
  the best way to predict the future is to create it . 
  he has a job , get him . 
  i am just restating the main points of the article , which are completely different than what the op stated in his misleading title . 
  to answer to your point however , i have to say it depends on the loan size and the interest rate . 
  a loan of 10 billion repaid in 10 years at 6 % is 14 billion when repaid back . 
  if the interest rate was subsidized at 2 % ( so the state is paying part of your loan ) , then the loan is at 11 billion when repaid back . 
  someone , just handed you 3 billion euros . 
  as a final note , this specific industry is so strategic and so heavily subsidized by all countries ( including canada , china , russia , brazil , etc ) that the whole point to discuss it in terms of `` free market '' terms is a bit hypocritical , except if we are just willfully accepting propaganda by whomever each time the article supports . 
  op is being completely dishonest . 
  the title of the article is as follows : ** exclusive : wto rules boeing 's state subsidies illegal ** * there is no mention of 90 bn ( wtf ? ), 
  * airbus is going to get zero out of the imaginary 90 bn and there is no mention of it losing anything . 
  * the state of washington should get back 9bn from boeing , since they gave the subsidy so that the factory would not leave the state . 
  * airbus was also found guilty as the recipient of illegal subsidies ( `` billions of euros '' ) in low-interest loans . 
  greece has a radical left party in government ( syriza ) . 
  inserting the adjective `` controversial '' before a politician 's name is complete hypocricy . 
  is there any contemporary politician ( or even historic , at his time of rule and not retroactively ) that is not ? 
  that is wholly accepted by the electorate and by the people ? 
  a court of law ? 
  losing 10 bn of gdp , would cause a readjustment of a few 100s of mn . 
  i am not sure you have figured this out properly . 
  scandinavia is wealthy but looks skinny because its gdp per ( large ) available area is not high . 
  would be interesting to see how it would like if split into regions . 
  because it is really larger than paris ( proper ) . 
  actually 10 times larger . 
  [ tahiti island ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tahiti ) is 45km long . 
  i do n't think it is that terrible as presented . 
  the greek exports to canada are not really that big ( 500 tn/year ) . 
  also , there is a sizeable greek community in canada ( 250.000 people at least ) that produce their own feta and sell it to the market for decades . 
  it would be a little strange to forbid them the use of the name . 
  also , the canadian producers will not be able to use `` greek '' ( name , flag , etc ) in their feta sold to canada . 
  moreover , while the greek companies will be able to export to canada ( with feta designation ) , the canadian exporters will not be able to sell their cheese as `` feta '' in europe . 
  i think it is more or less a reasonable compromise with a third sovereign entity . 
  inside the european union , feta can only be greek and this is a reasonable expectation under the european framework of name-origin protection , than believing that eu can impose its will on foreign entities without giving something in return . 
  there was a negotiation and what happened is not really that bad ( other cheeses , such as gorgonzola , faced the same fate as well ) . 
  well , given that trump asked everyone to comply with the 2 % gdp nato target , you are not exactly diverging from them . 
  it is surprising how much modern states need the high moral ground in many of their actions . 
  an aggressive or pre-emptive war is difficult to be justified to the populace . 
  i wonder how important this sentiment is , or if they are worried mostly about second-order effects ( such as trials in case they lose ), 
  sorry to spoil it for you guys , [ but the italians were not participating ] ( http://gelatoworldtour.com/challenges/european-challenge/ ) . 
  because the old and official [ gelato world cup ] ( http://en.coppamondogelateria.it/edizione-2003/ ) ( where they do ) is an other organization . 
  \u039fnly italy and france have ever won it . 
  the other countries just come to acknowledge their inferiority . 
  so andorra has 4 metal bands ? 
  i do n't think that we would something to be honest , we are mostly defending against the expansionist claims of the mini-sultan . 
  as far as the alt-right brigades , minus some idiots they would just shitpost from their pcs . 
  the kurds on the other hand . . 
  that 's a good grasp . 
  other important issues are : * priests can/should marry ( orthodox ) - can not mary ( catholic ) * bishops are celibate ( both in orthodox and catholic practices ) * papal infallibility is rejected ( orthodox ) , ecumenical councils have the gift of the holy spirit . 
  pope is infallible ( catholic ) . 
  more theological distinctions come from : * western churches tend towards rationality / scholasticity , eastern churches towards mysticism , experiental understanding of god . 
  * orthodox church venerates `` theosis '' - union with god , through hesychasm ( quitness ) , while the catholic and western church have been ( mostly ) against this as heretic and blasphemous towards the trinity and suggestive of polytheism . 
  this has been reconciliated recently by the western theologicians as less divisive . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  the parliament decides the top judges ( for life ) and greece has a supreme court . 
  areopagus is the supreme civil and criminal court of the land and the council of the state is the supreme administrative court . 
  long story short , the government ( through control of the parliament ) gets to decide on the top judges after a position is left vacant . 
  who controls and in what way does he organize and direct this `` power '' ? 
  you sneaky bastard !, 
  if you are flying , your line of sight is quite enormous on the other hand . 
  implying that you have visited all the square kilometers and thousands of streets in a capital city . 
  you should be more accurate / s, 
   beautiful country on balkan heh , shitstorm incoming . 
  also education ? 
  there are almost 8 million people working in public education ( out of the 22m in the [ public sector ] ( http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/terence-p-jeffrey/21955000-12329000-government-employees-outnumber-manufacturing ) ) . 
  the postal service employs and outstanding 600.000 people . 
  it seems also that most public sector jobs are in the local and state governments ( the federal government employs only 2.7 m of the total ), 
  asking `` why '' might compromise other citizens feeling of security and nothingiswrongliness . 
  thus you should be very very careful , citizen . 
  sure mate , sleep tight . 
  the kurds are coming . 
  because they are a minority , less than 30 % have turkish decent , while greeks in thrace are almost 70 % of the population of the region .
