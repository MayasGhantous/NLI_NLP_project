  moreover , `` correct information '' is not a commodity that is easy to define without an actual piece of `` correct information '' to corroborate against it . 
  like the case we are discussing , an external force had to intervene because the market was not correcting for it . 
  this argument extended implies that no free press or information can exist under such a setting . 
  every reporting organization is morally permitted to skew the results of a study if paid for that and the effect is not easily discoverable by its viewers . 
   the commission found that google had systematically given prominent placement in searches to its own comparison shopping service and demoted those of rivals in search results . 
  i wonder what is the r/anarcho _ capitalism argument in favor of this practice . 
  however , if the distribution of this net-benefit is much skewed to one side , or to very few people , things get slippery . 
  something is amiss . 
  you are saying that czechia is not obliged by the treaty of `` express condition '' to accept the euro , but should nonetheless accept it since it has signed the treaty ? 
  nah it 's over , brexiters never saw this one simple trick that made it impossible . 
  why is this an argument ? 
  eu economy is in the 16.000 bn . 
  eu states military budget is in the 200 bn . 
  so , we would save 10 % . 
  what would be the investment in time and money to achieve this ? 
  is it taken into account would the army still be of the same quality as before ? 
  and instead of working out the details of such a plan , which are certainly worth considering , the articles goes on about what we could have done with the imaginary money we might have saved using cotton candy graphs and some marginal improvements on everything that is considered the `` future of good things '' . 
  thanks god i have a `` bright '' man like yourself to help me . 
  no probs , the op gave an explanation on that , but it was not clear to me at least . 
  sure , no problem with that . 
  if this is the case then europe and asia should be included in the discussion . 
  did they prosecute anyone , or have they turned mostly a blind eye as well ? . 
  but i am not disagreeing on this . 
  i am disagreeing on saying that for some magic reason the same exact thing is not happening in europe with businesses . 
  it is a country , what hypocrisy are you talking about ? 
  all countries are totally hypocritic by common moral standards . 
  why the big proponent of environmentalism that is germany does not prosecute or extradict the vw executives on its own ? 
  oh , mah german hypocrisy . 
  this does not make any sense . 
  mah whataboutism, 
   american organizations have leverage in american governmental institutions that germans dont . 
   i was totally agreeing with you up to this . 
  what is so special about european companies that they do n't get involved in their countries politics ( implying siemens , vw , deutsche bank and other industrial and business behemoths do not represent or affect german interests ) . 
  they fled , while the police force and politicians were turning a blind eye because they were involved in the scandals and their capture would have repercussions to them . 
  actually slavo-macedonia is something that many greeks ( but not all ) consider a fair compromise . 
  namely slavic people living in parts of ancient macedonia . 
  on the other hand slavo-slovenia does not help you distinguish from slavo-slovakia . 
   that 's why we 've been in talks with them and trying to help them build a decent coast guatd . 
  that was before we bombed the shit out of their country or afterwards ? 
  graph shows no visible signs of recovery . 
  let 's call it `` slow recovery '' instead of the ultimate catastrophe that it really is . 
  if you want to make the discussion serious , for me tribes , or societies to put it in a better light matter as much as the individual . 
  the individual is one part of the equation . 
  moreover , the past matters as much as the present and as much as the future that will be created under current actions . 
  essentially , why not skip the name `` macedonia '' for the state if tribes and collectives of people do n't matter and keep it on an individual level ? 
  or the young realizing the motivation of the old . 
  haha , ok [ sure ] ( http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/200/369/161.jpg ) . 
  living people are part of tribes and the outcome of history . 
  and because our world is a speck of dust in an endless void ? 
  you are mostly right , but the last decades a trend has emerged where many old buildings are renovated and inner-city streets are being paved for pedestrians only . 
  while new buildings are quite modern and respect their surroundings . 
  hopefully it will persevere and affect a bit the shape of our cities . 
  that 's a very interesting comparison . 
  top eu net contributors give 800-900e / capita . 
  new york state , with 95bn per year and 20m population gives 4750 $ / capita . 
  also , ( net ) federal spending is 10-30 % of the gdp of the poorest states , while for poorest eu members it is * poland - 2 % * greece - 2.5 % * portugal - 1.5 % we are talking about an order of magnitude of larger fiscal transfers . 
  indeed , having invested heavily in the machinery and equipment of a car manufacturing plant helps also . 
  cheers bro, 
  doubt it , i never made such a point . 
  you said sth between 22-45 . 
  it is 50 % and upwards . 
  if you have a high enough income you pay +11 % solidarity tax . 
  if you are a new company you pay double the tax on your profit for the first year . 
  good source on the main points i made , but outdated . 
  vat is not 23 % anymore and it does not include solidarity tax ( 2-11 % ) , professional tax and prepayment of next years tax . 
  edit : if you are greek , check [ this ] ( https://www.taxexperts.gr/%ce%b5%cf%81%ce%b3%ce%b1%ce%bb%ce%b5%ce%af%ce%b1/%cf%83%cf%85%ce%bd%cf%84%ce%b5%ce%bb%ce%b5%cf%83%cf%84%ce%ad%cf%82-%cf%86%ce%bf%cf%81%ce%bf%ce%bb%ce%bf%ce%b3%ce%af%ce%b1%cf%82 ) from the online forum of greek accountants . 
  * 100 % upfront payment of tax ( when you start you pay double the tax and you carry this over to the next year ) * 29 % business tax rate on profits * 20 % pension tax rate on profits * 6.95 % medical insurance tax rate on profits * 300-600\u0395uro / year professional tax * 2-10 % solidarity tax if you have more than 12k in income * 24 % vat * multiple other small tax hikes, 
  facebook paid 22 b for the acquisition of whatsapp . 
  this fine is barely 0.5 % of the transaction . 
   facebook is accused of misleading the eu with a claim that it was technically impossible for it to merge users between the two services . 
  i mean , who reviewed this silliness and was mislead in the first place ? 
  had the biggest donner in germany for 2.5 . 
  the guy even added some feta when he found out we were greeks . 
  muh multiculturalism at its best . 
  let me [ sip ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kowf-ezqpbc/tthzex4wb6i/aaaaaaaaeug/gpu7xof44ba/s1600/ancientgreeks2ww2.jpg ) a bit from my frape , while i upvote you . 
  mastergame : shilling for both , getting double the benefits , while you secretly promote your worldwide domination plans . 
  i think this would be wrong . 
  a part of the land being replete from national laws and under no-man 's authority . 
  too much power would be concentrated there . 
  it works also with indirect/diffuse radiation but the power output you get is much lower . 
  it seems that [ ireland ] ( http://solargis.com/assets/graphic/free-map/ghi/solargis-ireland-ghi-solar-resource-map-en.png ) is 20-30 % worse than [ germany ] ( http://www.joewein.net/img/blog/insolation-kwh-de.png ) in terms of available irradiation . 
  i completely agree . 
  also , the fact that brussels is the capital of a constituent member is king of weird . 
  moving everything might be costly , but it could be also a way to re-invent and re-imagine europe as a vibrant and dynamic new place , built on new stronger foundations , approved by the people . 
  brussels has served its purpose , almost as a commitee decision . 
  it was the compromise that nobody liked , but was not giving to any large member an `` unfair '' advantage . 
  strasbourg has both french and german heritage . 
  it is located centrally in europe and is the home of the european court of human rights . 
  this could be a symbolic move that europe is moving its heart towards humans again . 
  exactly , and actually took a cut during the crisis , and will take a further non-insignificant one during brexit . 
  so , currently the eu gdp is around 16tn , making the eu budget less than 1 % while national budgets could be as high as 30-40 % . 
  moreover , a lot of this money returns to the countries that issued them , making the net fiscal transfers from richer to poorer countries even less . 
  it is not that 150 bn got transfered to the poor countries , but sth like 30-40 net . 
  toledo cathedral has a built-in , full-proof design to avoid religious-conversion . 
  that 's a neihgbornet excellor to be spied by your placers, 
  well , at least we made it to the list lads . 
  take that turkey . 
  but have we tried ? 
  you do n't have to be so anti-fiberglass . 
  the greek country as is just tries to be friendly and increase trade agreements with all its neighbors , as long as they do n't infringe on its rights and interests .
