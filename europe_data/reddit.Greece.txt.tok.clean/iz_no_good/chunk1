no matter how u decide to call urself , you are still a country with no real history and thus no real national identity . 
  stealing a name , and building ridiculous statues to back this , will not get you anything , just hiding the problems under the carpet . 
  today on things that never happened !, 
  unless you went on a time travelling flight that took you back to the 80s ^ ^, 
  thanks for taking the time to auto-correct the fyrom thing , 
  pornhub 's idea was pretty cool too . 
  didnt work for me though , cos i share the videos to my social accounts anyway :p, 
  in other words , life is a bitche over there . 
  in that case its a no !, 
  i dont want the whole neighborhood talking bad about my son 's whereabouts ^ ^ \\ s, 
  if she has a good character , i dont see why not . . 
  now repeat the poll but adding that the black/asian/muslim / jewish person is rich . 
  thanks . 
  i am also in the process of reading this [ thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/6rvusy/is_the_military_worship_of_the_spartans_really/ ), 
  had to be said !, 
  i am just kidding  i guess its very hard , impossible to know if they did believe all those ... hardcore principles of spartan society , for example the `` come back winners or dead on your shield '' , but that 's just me , perhaps people who study history can prove me wrong with a few sources . 
  and go buy a country house to crete by the beach , to live peacefully till the end of his days . 
  considering that he was part of the public sector , i have to agree ^ ^ \\ s, 
  assuming op took the photo recently , we were under a heat wave throughout all last week , and at the city center is even more unbearable :(, 
  leonidas was [ approximately 60 years old ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leonidas_i ) when this battle that led to his death took place . 
  such a sad story , he was only a few years away from retiring and getting to pension . 
  nice photo , i am pretty sure it came at a high cost of your sweating to capture it though !, 
  function check_is_\u03b1\u03ba\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 ( $ number ) { if ( intval ( $ number ) = = = $ number ) { return $ number . '', 
  is \u03b1\u03ba\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 '' ; } else { return $ number . '', 
  you are right . 
  next time you see a wallet in a locked car on a very hot day , smash the window and save that poor wallet and its credit cards . 
  now that i think of it , smash the window no matter the weather conditions ( \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  great . 
  now i have georgia on my mind . 
   paying 3 $ every month is this the usual in portugal ? 
  i know , i know . 
  more tables coming soon , stay tuned !, 
  damn , i checked the map and kazakhstan is h u g e. how did i miss it ?!? 
  me too \u00af \\ \\ \\ __ ( \u30c4 ) __ / \u00af, 
  ** thanks !, 
  ** \\* presses the follow button and waits for more similar quality tweets *, 
  i had heard of it , that its ideal for machine learning apps etc. 
  now that i dug it a bit , it seems it provides 3 tables : reddit_comments , reddit_posts , reddit_extracts , but there is a 1 month delay , currently last `` partition '' on the tables is called 2017_06 , not sure when the july 's data will be available there . 
  in anycase , this can be pretty handy , thanks for the tip !, 
  reddit displays how many subs each subreddit has , but this doesnt mean subscribers from a specific country 's sub do engage with r/europe . 
  on the other hand , to get demographics of the active users posting/commenting on r/europe is a pretty more intensive work/resource intense than what i currently did , i am still thinking if i should go that way for more insight stats, 
  can you elaborate a bit more maybe ?!, 
   very important country, 
  thanks for pointing that out . 
  it was a mistake , will fix that asap !, 
  you mean the upvotes each post has ? 
  europe is the country , all rest in the list are mere provinces !, 
  oh i loved all those ads , i would fully support them if i was a croat !, 
  you can see the whole list of posts for croatia here : http pastebin dot com `` forward slash '' jrkjndbf , i would copy paste here but would be a wall of text :(, 
  i went over the list of urls fast again just now , most of them are legit and a large part is brexit related . 
  perhaps as a user i was n't paying too much attention to the topic this month , oh well . 
  now that you mention it , i would like to see the results for `` turkey is not europe '' ** and ** `` remove kebab '' !, 
  i guess it would be a really close race !, 
  we could use some help if he knows how to make good looking charts !, 
  europe stronk !, 
   as for uk , they had brexit , several isolated incidents of muslims wreaking havoc and death , as well as the fire tragedy so they 've been a mention-worthy failure of a government . 
  these were last month , right ? 
  i thought of this too . 
  probably uk would be dominating even harder the charts last month ( although they would prefer not to obviously ), 
  personally , i did n't expect russia to be that popular though , or uk . 
  there is a json api that you can use to get the data of a post or subreddit formatted in a way easier to process programmatically , much easier than scraping the html page . 
  you just append the . json to the url most of the times . 
  there i can retrieve the flair ( text or css icon ) of each user . 
  but this requires to crawl * all * posts , and obviously gives us access to more information/stats than just topics discussed in the subreddit as i currently do . 
  yep , keywords like this are already included for poland , but not all posts have in their title country names/nationalities . 
  for example , many posts just mention well known cities , or politician names etc etc. 
  i had to add keywords to cover those titles too . 
  i know , just a joke mate , 
  mark my words folks : a day will come , when germans will not need their passport to travel abroad during summer , just displaying their long socks with sandals will be enough !, 
  [ video from the air traffic controller informing the russian dm that he can not pass ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/njyrp176nqshs/giphy.gif ), 
  all the best for you guys !, 
  [ just ... ... ] ( https://i.makeagif.com/media/1-29-2016/qhtg0g.gif ), 
  he is clearly a [ garbage fan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpbfoj3r0m4 ), 
  eu should respond immediately to relief those guys from this imminent natural disaster . 
  we should send t-shirts and short pants asap !, 
  hope next time i visit the metro station which is near the area , i will not stumble upon some submarine !, 
  world * has * to respect the sovereignty of each country , and this comes to conflict with `` common sense '' in many occasions where local goverments turn authoritarian or against their people commiting crimes daily ( recent examples syria & venezuela ) . 
  you can see that eu already criticizes openly erdogan , recently we had escalations with germany . 
  since eu needs turkey to help deal with the refugees , they have selected a more passive role just reacting to erdogan 's moves to the minimum degree possible . 
  holy cow , this is massive !, 
  ** poland can into presidential palace !, 
  so , basically you have never been abroad ? 
  right , i got more confused than i should with those guys who know other guys :p, 
  damn , if only i had a guy who knew a guy who owns i hotel/bar over there , i would definitely ask him to hire you !, 
  so sorry i cant help :p perhaps you can check if you can get a job in a hotel/bar , they do prefer foreigners in places that mainly deal with foreign tourists . 
  perhaps he meant that he was visiting on vacations , not living there . 
  oh ok , thank you . 
  i thought there was another measurement , that shows % of subscribers commenting , interacting with the sub 's posts etc. 
  how do you check the active subs of a sub ? 
  we are using electricity to produce these ice cubes , and you have them popping right outside your door ?!? 
  damn !, 
  i understand your point of view , no hard feelings mate , 
  mosquitoes probably had the party of their lives last night at kos, 
   maybe it got better over the last year ? 
  given that there were no crucial negotiations this year ( and not much schauble in the news \\ ^ \\ ^ ) with germany requiring more austerity , the `` anti-german '' feelings have declined . 
  if people are right or wrong on this , is another matter and a very complicated one to go into . 
  yes , cant tell from the photo , but he could try reverse if the car in front was an obstacle , right ? 
  instead , he opened the door and let the water in , i guess this shows he decided he was out of options :(, 
  that overconfident jeep/suv owner fail though .
