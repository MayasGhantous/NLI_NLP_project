  i see , thank you . 
  just came to my mind : could it be that turkey 's leadership is heating things up with germany in order to interfere with the upcoming german elections ? 
  ( manipulate the turkish immigrants to vote for an opposition party ) ? 
  the problem is that its not as easy to prepare as frappe is , but if you practice a bit you will eventually reach a decent level !,

  make coffee great again !, 
  since you are into cold coffees , you need to try the new enhanced version , [ freddo cappuccino/espresso !,

  actually , we call '' \u0399\u03bd\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 '' the native american , and '' \u0399\u03bd\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 '' the person from india . 
   firstly , how are we sure they are not historical greeks but slavs . 
  do they claim themselves as slavs ? 
  they are slavs , coming from bulgarian tribes afaik . 
  and albanians on the other side . 
   secondly , i ca n't understand how it can be a problem if they were somewhere in the amazon , nobody would care . 
  but now they live next door to the lands their `` ancestors '' used to live . 
  need to say more if this is dangerous ? 
  obviously , its not a threat nowadays , but nobody can tell what the balance would be in the years to come  thirdly , what would you think about turkey adopting greek heritage ? 
  the directly equivalent scenario would be that turkey believes they are just as greeks as the other greeks . 
  but they wouldnt want to unite with the rest of greece , rather stay on their lands ( and ... wait for the right opportunity to . . pay a visit i guess ! ) . 
  and obviously in the meantime , change the country name to greece   the credit still goes to ancient greeks , rather than their descendants or random slavs . 
  i really agree with this one . 
  many people like to feel proud for their ancestors , but they should ask themselves if their ancestors would be proud of them too, 
  if you have all the facts about this story and still wonder why we dont want them get away with it , then not sure what more i can add . 
  they are trying to claim a history that does n't belong to them , they pretend they are someone else . 
  why not let it go ? 
  because besides being wrong , its also dangerous . 
  not now , but can be after a few decades/generations etc.

  fast drinkers are just amateurs do you have ice ( cold ) coffees too ? 
  are you familiar with `` freddo cappuccino/espresso '' ?

  well , i dont see why you play the victim card here , all balkans were under ottoman rule for centuries , but only those 2 converted ( albanians partially afaik ) . 
  as i have read , [ bosnians converted for getting privileges ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamization_of_bosnia_and_herzegovina ) in the ottoman empire . 
   economic and social gain was also an incentive to become a muslim : conversion to islam conferred economic and social status . 
  under the feudal system imposed by the ottomans , only those who converted to islam could acquire and inherit land and property , which accorded them political rights , a status usually denied to non-muslims . 
  a number of christian nobles , however , were able to retain their estates early on in the ottoman rule by fighting on behalf of the empire , suggesting that holding on to their property was not a major incentive for early conversions to islam . 
  at a lower socioeconomic level , most new converts to islam were able to turn their holdings into freehold farms . 
  at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder were the serfs , who constituted the majority of the population and were predominantly christians . 
  in addition , only muslims could hold positions in the ottoman state apparatus , which conferred special privileges and a much higher standard of living . 
  muslims also enjoyed legal privileges : christians could not sue muslims and their testimony could not be used against muslims in court . 
  [ 5 ] however , these incentives would not necessarily explain why the bosnians and albanians mostly converted to islam , but most other balkan groups ( serbs , croats , greeks , romanians , and bulgarians ) did not . 
  i am not judging them , but pretending it was other europeans mistake that they converted , does n't seem right or fair . 
  they could have done what the other occupied nations did . 
  i see , its not that simple in this case . 
   germany can not abandon that base without abandoning its commitments to nato . 
  assuming germany is mistreated by turkey here , then i do n't think nato allies would blame her for a new potential withdraw . 
  so , germany was hosted in another turkish base besides incirlik ? 
  and they didnt abandon that one at the same time they left incirlik ? 
  this doesnt make much sense to me . 
  i do n't know man .

  ok , its confirmed : the greek word tsoureki is borrowed from turkish \u00e7\u00f6rek . 
  some dictionaries claim that this is derived from the old turkish root \u00e7evir - ` turn ' ; [ 3 ] others say it is persian [ 4 ] or armenian . 
  i guess they would already know from the shirt around the arm pits . 
  speaking of arm pits , i wonder if the ancients had anything to suggest about that too ?

  many many thanks !, 
  can somebody assist me get a list of the 50 +6 countries the subreddit claims it covers ? 
  i found this list [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/subreddits ) but doesnt add up to 56, 
  my thoughts exactly . 
  even if we take the bad scenario that island stays separated with 2 states , northern side ca n't claim resources that were found on the southern side . 
   what has the north ever done to invest or foster or plan for the infrastructure , diplomacy and machinery necessary to drill in the eastern mediterranean ? 
  answer : nothing . 
  i understand your point . 
  but the resources belong to the island and its inhabitants . 
  if 1 side doesnt pay for preparations to extract the resources , then i am sure both sides can come up with a formula to calculate what each side gets . 
  but , in my opinion , they are not entitled on those resources of southern side , until a permanent resolution is made . 
  well , 2 scenarios i can think of : 1 . if the island stays split , t/c side can not claim resources that belong to southern side . 
  if they find resources on their side , they would belong to them . 
  2 . if they work things out , they get their share ( by collecting retroactively their shares ) but turkey asking to stop projects before solution is worked out , makes no sense to me , life has to go on . 
  i prefer to leave a better than average tip , how many of these should i tip ? 
  suggestion : cyprus should continue their oil digging endeavors , and deposit the profit ( if any ? ), 
  shares of t/c to banks . 
  when the cyprus reunification matter is resolved , wire the money to them . 
  and make sure the money stays on the island . 
  i was joking . 
  ( withdraw ... victoriously ? 
  i understand it can happen sometimes , but usually withdraw means defeat ), 
  we can say they had a victorious withdrawal edit : joking,
