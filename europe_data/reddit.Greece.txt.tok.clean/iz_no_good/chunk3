  i miss you so much !, 
  \\ - sure , i know a good parking lot we can go and show me your **** , just come after midnight !, 
  & nbsp ; attention : dont try this in sweden during summer folks !, 
  your daily dose of drama is right here !, 
  as the motto says : 50 ( +6 ) countries , 230 languages , 743m people ... 1 subreddit . 
  i did n't know danube river leads to middle earth !, 
  scientists of europe, 
  perhaps it would be better if he was part of the `` scientists of europe '' instead ? 
  but according to turkish redditors , erdogan is the most pro-kurdish president they had for years / s, 
  elections in turkey are openly characterized as rigged with invalid ballots accounted for , and you really think that you can hold a solid referendum that turkey wo n't / ca n't interfere ? 
  your government is already a turkish puppet , you really believe the potential referendum will not be in accordance to turkey 's expectations ?!, 
  i guess you mean that mods awarded him with this special icon , and i guess this happens rarely , cos i cant remember seeing users with `` special '' flair before . 
  thank you !, 
  i have to ask . 
  next to op 's name i can see a blue tower or something . 
  never seen it before . 
  what does it mean ? 
  i bet you had a good time assembling the top right part !, 
  we have a breach , the portal to outer space is open !, 
  quick , send the avengers !, 
  afaik , they are arriving to their destination on sunday . 
  i am curious to see what police 's response will be . 
  no , thats not what i meant . 
  just that turkey has double standards, 
   without an interpol notice , the sought coup attempt suspects are able to use their current passports . 
  erdogan 's condemn of interpol for being part of gullen 's organization incoming . 
  [ may i suggest an educational map to learn about your history ?!? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6lekt2/europe_and_the_byzantine_empire_about_1000_ad/ ), 
  i see correct statements , i upvote . 
  enjoy your popcorn !, 
  i guess germany 's upcoming elections may have something to do with that . 
  going hard on him , could force turks of germany to vote another party . 
  if he manages to control turks in germany , he can perhaps interfere in german elections if he decides so , right ? 
  thanks for the summary . 
  i was referring to the bulgaria in balkans peninsula ( hadnt even notice the country near russia , the volga bulgaria ) . 
  seems that bulgarians settled initially to what is nowadays fyrom . 
  interesting map . 
  i could n't help but notice where bulgaria used to be located back then . 
  i did some research about caretta-caretta too today , its status is `` vulnerable '' , one level higher than `` endangered '' . 
  [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/loggerhead_sea_turtle ), 
  perhaps we need some turkish soldiers in / r/europe as well , to guarantee the turkish redditors ' comments karma !, 
  i dont know , [ wikipedia says 18 % back in 2008 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_turkey ) , thats where i got the number . 
  i am talking about the kurds living in turkey . 
  its the ~ 20 % of the total population . 
  so , when you are the minority , the country should be demilitarized . 
  when you are the majority , everything is fine ( poor kurds ) . 
  turkish logic . 
  rumors say that the tram # 666 seen in 2nd picture , was cursed !, 
  & nbsp ; sometimes , you could hear the sounds of the `` highway to hell - ac/dc '' song coming out from its speakers !, 
  that 's what happened to me some years ago . 
  the police man did n't know english , so he let us go ( we got randomly picked to stop for papers check , rental car ) . 
  the ship was allegedly carrying narcotics . 
  similar incident a few months ago with albanian-greek drug traffickers in co-operation with italian coast guard . 
  warning shots first , shots on boat followed .

  i guess they are trying to help warm aegean 's waters right at the beginning of summer season ? 
  problem is , we dont enter turkish waters , besides accidental violations by fishing ships . 
  because we have no reason to provoke other country , and obviously not in the touristic season, 
  so , yeah ... right in the beginning of the long awaited summer season , greece decides to provoke turkey ? 
  is this what you are saying ? 
  gib me a break, 
  it went back to turkish waters the news say, 
  thats a pretty interesting finding , reddit detectives doing real work !, 
  i understand , i agree with your ideas , all i am saying is that this is easier said than done . 
  for the moment , i guess we need to stabilize the economy and perhaps attract foreign investments ( since salaries have decreased a lot , unemployment etc. ) . 
  back to baby steps !, 
  i see what you mean , and agree . 
  i am just saying that most `` small '' countries have similar economy model like greece ( mainly importing stuff & exporting human resources , tourism etc ) . 
  because to develop/produce your own products in a country with 80 mill potential customers is more sustainable/profitable than in a country with 10 mill , especially when it comes to advanced products . 
  simply said , not all countries can have their own made cars . 
  either cos they lack the technology to produce them , or because even if they would , the market is not enough to support the vendor . 
  bottom line : turkey with the 80 mill population should be compared to countries like italy/spain/germany / france . 
  10 million pop countries cant keep up with them ( exceptions exist , probably switzerland/israel ) , its the sad truth . 
  are you suggesting they helped with the bailouts in order to buy those vital national companies ? 
  thats not true , because there were international tenders , any company could file an offer and buy them . 
  somehow it was german ones in those 2 cases , there was a chinese buying stocks for athens 's port . 
  the reasons why we are dependent as an economy are many , to name a few : small country , accession to eu & globalization , local politicians and people 's mentality . 
  do you know many/any eu countries with population < 10 million that are dependent ? 
  oh ok , if no cities near then i guess this explains it . 
  because such quality beaches , usually do n't go unnoticed by the crowds \\ ^ ^, 
  partially right , but used wrong companies . 
  these companies were doing well here for years , since everybody appreciates german quality products . 
  new german players that entered the scene after crisis and german bailout packages are : dt ( acquired the national telecom organization ) , fraport ( leased all airports ) . 
  siemens was involved for years with government deals , bribery scandals emerged etc germans have the money , and they . . invest on vital industries that provide low risk on their investments . 
  i guess they do this everywhere they can, 
  is this opinion widely accepted in hungary ? 
  or this guy just digs his own grave ( politically speaking ) ?!, 
  i am pretty sure this beach is packed , from tourists or not !, 
  unless there is not easy access to it, 
  i agree with you , i like to believe that in a environment of global peace , its not easy to have one country invade another and the whole world look the other way . 
  ( exception : if the country is a big player with nukes . ) . 
  so , personally under current situation i dont feel threatened . 
  but if a world war is to break out , i am sure various countries that feel they have the advantage over enemies , may seize the opportunity to solve bilateral matters via war . 
  and turkey is in my list of potential aggressors . 
  especially with turkey seemingly getting a clear advantage with f-35 , s-400 etc after a few years, 
  wait , they host  2million syrian refugees , the plot is in motion :o, 
  mps are on the right side ? 
  but the guy addressing the parliament looks towards the left side ? 
  left side is for journalists ? 
  if i ever wanted to become a politician , i would do it in portugal !,
