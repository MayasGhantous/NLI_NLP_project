  and that 's why they wore masks i guess . 
  could n't deal with seeing their faces on next day 's newspapers !, 
  ok , this conversation gets too long already  you approve israels 's case due to religion continuity , but not ours for example ( due to language ) . 
  in my book , the legitimate heir is the one closer to the given ancient civ . . in fyrom 's case , i can see no way somebody could support their claims ( historical & territorial ) over greeks . 
   would my ancestors be proud ? 
  that was a question i usually address to fellow greeks that feel proud about their ancestors , not you , sorry if it was n't clear . . 
  at this point no one can claim to be their heir . 
  the line was broken not once , but twice . 
  this is your opinion . 
  obviously links between ancient civs and modern ones have been broken , doesnt mean there is no `` legitimate hair '' . 
  everybody accepts de facto modern egypt to be the rightful hair of ancient egyptians , right ? 
  modern israel was formed from people living all around the world , are they linked to the old ones who were living in ancient israel ? 
  same is here . 
  find the real heir or the closest one . 
  ( i am not going to the scientific analysis if we are the real ones , but i can not even discuss that we are the closest ones )  `` someone else did something and that 's why i 'm so amazing . '', 
  does n't make sense when talking about actual offspring getting wealth and power from their parents personally i find this very true , and many people ( even here ) should realize it . 
  being proud for your parents/ancestors is not a big deal , its not something * you * accomplished . 
  actually a good counter-question i usually ask is : would your ancestors be proud of you as well ? 
   that macedonia has no relation to the modern one , but it also has no relation to modern greece . 
  the macedonians were seen as barely being better than barbarians . 
  alexander saw him self as being greek but ultimately he became culturally persian more than anything . 
  perhaps you are right . 
  just like any modern greek is not related to ancient athens/sparta and all the city states . 
  there was no greece back then . 
  but it was * forming * as the centuries went by . 
  and macedonia eventually was integrated to this . 
  the link between then and now , 2k + + years apart , is obviously broken . 
  what it boils down to is : who is the most legitimate heir of the ancient macedonian legacy ? 
  i guess the country who speaks the same ( evolved ) language is the right answer . 
  obrigado , i guess i am a bit tired . 
  replied to your buddy already . 
  ooh , exit . 
  i totally didnt see it coming :p well , they are getting away already with too many things , we shall not let them steal our eu membership as well !, 
  wait , < - means `` next '' in chrono-order , your -  means ? 
  france is looking at you as well !, 
  this rises concerns : are you by any chance a relative to dracula going out only in the night ?!? 
  :p jokes aside , whatever works for each one . 
  for sure it sounds pretty impressive to me !, 
  you mean you do n't need sunglasses during summer under a clear sky ? 
  i am sure you do, 
  if this is the case , then there is a treasure as well !, 
  well , no sunglasses is a big no-no in summer everywhere at the south i guess , including croatia too !, 
  damn !, 
  i did n't see it coming , but can see the resemblance :p, 
  being a lotr fan too , i am curious which one you have in mind ? 
  2 . his advisor ? 
  theoden when he was under spell ? 
  let me add one more that popped up on / r/europe today : [ mountain ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6j96iq/mountains_of_europe_vaalserberg_the_netherlands/ ), 
  that was insane in the brain !, 
  not sure about other places , but in case of the istanbul , it makes sense , since muslims . . arrived later . 
  probably you know this , they have a [ huge mosque ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sultan_ahmed_mosque ) right across hagia sophia . 
  i am talking about `` pride '' aspect . 
  if i was a turk , i would prefer to go pray to the blue mosque , which my ancestors built , and not to a place i know it was built for other purposes . 
  istanbul is a 15 million city . 
  you clearly have a lot of mosques , the capacity of hagia sophia is not the reason behind this . 
  friends at turkey : if you need more mosques in the city , why dont you build your own ?!? 
  i really do n't get it, 
  as if they were not burning already !, 
  is there a problem with the portuguese flag or its intentional ? 
  we start at dawn !, 
  have watched the video , looks the same beach to me !, 
  `` those foreign cars are coming and destroying our country '' memes incoming, 
  that would interfere with the libyan smugglers interests i guess . 
  they need to make a living from the immigrants you know, 
  i think that back then , they didnt have everything figured out ( and makes sense to me ) . 
  also , a 10 million pop country in theory * should * not be able to destabilize whole europe . 
   it was a political decision more than a financial one . 
  i guess geopolitical reasons played their part too . 
  i agree 100 % with the order you provided . 
  i guess eu can wash its hands and point the finger towards the greek government for providing the infamous `` greek statistics '' . 
  but my personal guess is that they knew that something fishy was going on . 
   425-kilometre march . 
  that 's a lot of kilometers to walk :o, 
  that memo though , cant tell if temperature is -35 -- or 36 + + at those areas away from the coast :p, 
   being passionate is one thing , but throwing things to the court ai n't no fun . 
  you are right . 
  unfortunately , there is no way to change this , it happens to this very day , perhaps less frequently ( also teams tried to counter this by adding safety nets around the court , like a caged arena ! ), 
  [ example from 1.5 month ago ( no injury to the coach ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iofsgnhyfo4 ) i am a panathinaikos supporter , but cant say i remember * all * the 1996 final to judge the outcome , there are other games i can recall that we were the ones mistreated ( cska - pao semifinal at istanbul 5-6 years ago ) , what can you do ? 
  that 's how they want to run the game , same applies for football . 
  you go watch a game and look forward to a good performance of your team , * and * for a fair treatment from the referees :( ps . 
  i find it spectacular how spain can be so good at both football/basketball !, 
  i guess the late 00 's nt was the one i remember being strongest . 
  but also cant forget how you won that semifinal in the eurobasket held in spain :p it was the year our nt was at its peak too ( imho ) . 
  anyway , it comes and goes i guess . . 
  oh , is he known about it ? 
  i met him only recently , but can definitely confirm you re right !, 
  cant imagine poland 's surprise when she wakes up and cant recognize anyone around :o, 
  issue was discussed waaay more in a few other threads the last 10 days , [ here is one to start with :p ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/13/macedonias-nato-hopes-rise-as-deal-with-greece-looks-feasible ), 
  those were the years when basketball was the biggest thing in the country , immediate result of this 1987 achievement , with millions invested to make the teams competitive for the national `` race '' to bring international cups home for the 1st time . 
  consider the race to explore space between us and ussr to get the idea !, 
  fans were obviously fully committed to this as well , supporting the teams at home and abroad . 
  as the teams became successful at 1996 ( panathinaikos ) and 1997 i think ( olympiakos , they lost the race ) , things started to get cooler , but the greek passion of the fans remains , its the tamperamento , thats just who we are  where are you from by the way ? 
  i am curious to see which teams fans you encountered and got this impression , 
  sorry , i cant see any correlation of such a move with the elections , if they are taking place in 10 days . 
  how would the world call its people though ? 
  it would be a problem i think, 
  fuck this . 
  lets just say : best and brightest turks go west as much as ** ten thousands ** per month, 
  nice photo , feels good to see events happening * today * , on structures created 2k years ago !, 
  the design of the theater , looks so alike with the one in palmyra , syria , [ photo ] ( https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/9aad/production/_93679593_getty_palmyra.jpg ),
