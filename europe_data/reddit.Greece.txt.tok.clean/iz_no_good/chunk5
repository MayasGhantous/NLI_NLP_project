  thank you for your kind gesture . 
  but karma is fake internet points , while land and history are not . 
  perhaps you can pay half the debt and i will think about it ? 
  ( since you * had * to bring it up in a non financial conversation ), 
  obviously , reddit doesnt allow me to do it . 
  but imagine 2 `` genwashington1776 '' . 
  and after a few months , coming at you and saying : hey , that post you had done a few years back , you know this is mine , i am the legal heir of that karma etc. 
  give me that karma , i am `` genwashington1776 '' !, 
  hope you see better now what is going on . 
  besides been dangerous for the future in regards to territory , its a direct theft of history . 
  and why ? 
  because they decided so , on their own , somewhere in the last 100 years, 
  i just tried to make a new reddit account , called `` genwashington1776 '' . 
  i failed miserably . 
  you know why ? 
  cos its already taken , and reserved !, 
  but you know what ? 
  i dont care . 
  i will still call myself `` genwashington1776 '' and ask everyone to accept me with that name , fuck the guy who had it first !, 
  i have the right to call myself anyhow i like !, 
  lord buckethead is darth 's vader father , right ? 
  good luck to eu negotiating with him !, 
  since `` serbia strong '' was such a big hit , ca n't imagine the success of the `` great serbian empire strong '' version !, 
  goes a bit far back but its the most characteristic one where russia had to try help, 
   the blood from those areas has been dilutes for 2400 years . 
  this is applicable all around the world . 
  but i believe there are some `` rules '' of which modern countries can be considered successors of defunct countries/ethnicities/whatever . 
  like land , language , historical proof of the links . 
  as far as i know , our neighbors do n't fit any of those criteria , trying to link them to ancient macedonians . 
  sidenote : [ slavs arrived in the area long after death of christ ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonians_\\ ( ethnic_group \\ ) #origins _ and_settlement ), 
  i am not familiar with the irish issue . 
  are people living in northern ireland irish ? 
  or people who settled there from england as part of the occupation ? 
  if they are irish , they have every right to be called < something  ireland . 
  they are ethnically irish , and live in the same island . 
  but in our case , we have 2 things : the land , and the ancestry . 
  yes , they live in a tiny part of the [ ancient macedonia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/map_macedonia_336_bc-en.svg/992px-map_macedonia_336_bc-en.svg.png ) does this give them the right to call the whoole country by that name ? 
  turkey has 2-3 % of its lands on balkans , can they call themselves a balkan country ? 
  and then , we have the history . 
  they use symbols of the ancient macedonia , while they are not related to them ( they are slavs & albanians ) . 
   of course , to further the analogy , if northern ireland started to claim that they 're the ireland , that would be a problem . 
  this is what is happening now , and many countries have supported by recognition . 
  and in their eyes , we are the bad guys , they are the victims, 
  i have to compliment you by saying that i feel you have a pretty accurate picture of the whole issue , for living so far away from it   large part consider themselves to be ` macedonians ' although i am from the northern part , afaik they call themselves macedonians cos they live in a province called macedonia ( as people in crete -  cretans ) , not a sub-ethnicity or whatever . 
  nobody in greece believes that ancient macedonia was not greek . 
  & nbsp ; the fact that the current balance between the 2 countries does n't leave much space for territorial claims from their side , doesnt mean that they should be let to get away with it . 
  i find this approach wrong . 
  its not about being `` big '' or `` small '' , its about being wrong or right . 
  they build their own illusions of macedonian ancestry , its time they smell the coffee and realize that you just cant go steal someone 's history . 
  lets hope they * do * want to find a solution , personally i do n't believe them , but lets see , 
  i am sure there are similar cases around the world , but i am not familiar to speak about . 
  in this case , its not only about lands , but about the historical truth as well . 
  [ instead of listening to me ( a random guy ) , feel free to read the official position if you want to know more ] ( http://www.mfa.gr/en/fyrom-name-issue/ ), 
  since you talk offensively , i guess you are right . 
  let me show you the way to / r/iamverysmart where you belong, 
  you make it sound as if we are the bad ( small country = good guys , big country = bullies approach ? ), 
  guys of the story , but its the other way around . 
  another ~ 10 yo that belongs to / r/iamversmart but somehow ended up in another subreddit !, 
  nothing is going to happen , i call it . 
  our neighbors have been living for so long in their own illusions ( that they are somehow right to call their country macedonia , or that they are somehow linked to macedonians ) , backed from many countries in the world for 20 + years , that they will not accept going back to negotiate a name that is aligned with the truth . 
  they have created a deadlock , that i do n't see how we ca n't both get out . 
  tbh , any proposal that includes word `` macedonia '' is a sacrifice from our behalf if you ask me . 
  central balkans democracy . 
  since they want a geographically backed name , here is one that does n't offend anyone . 
  & nbsp ; ps . 
  if un needs me to solve other international matters , i am free next week . 
  nato 's equally american response : talk to my lawyer !, 
  thanks , i checked too and found [ this ] ( https://www.technologyreview.com/s/521976/are-electric-vehicles-a-fire-hazard/ ) serious problem with electric cars if you ask me , but perhaps ( given the structural damage the car suffered ) the same would have happened with a benz powered car, 
  are electric cars equally prone to go in flames as gas powered cars ? 
  i can tell the car is flipped , but what caused the fire ? 
  the batteries fluids perhaps ? 
  once inhabited by monks , and soon to be home of jedis !,

  and as some guy i once met told me , maynet will be replaced by a self-aware platform , called skynet . 
  i know , but it would be looking weird if us considered them trustworthy allies , while eu not , idk . 
  well , they just made a deal to buy us weapons ( a lot of them ) , so no .

  looks a bit different due to copyright issues . 
  i typed `` is europe '' google autocompleted `` a country '' as well . 
  holy moly , i am going right into it !, 
  [ that face though :p ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b8lhuxa83oc/hqdefault.jpg?custom=true&amp;w=336&amp;h=188&amp;stc=true&amp;jpg444=true&amp;jpgq=90&amp;sp=68&amp;sigh=xk805kh8plrwvaalqyzgm2gtnu0 ), 
  wow , good job  but i guess you dont remember much of all those bits and bytes , thats why i preferred something more `` concentrated '' ( but not like an 1-2 hr video for the whole ww1 , perhaps ~ 10-15 hours ) . 
  i dont know , perhaps i will resume the series at some point too !, 
  i watched recently the playlist for the 1st year of the war , it was amazing . 
  i only wish they made more concentrated videos , not a 7min per week of the war , it needs too much time to watch all that :(, 
  oh , so this is why , thanks for the input . 
  oh , thats weird , perhaps this was just the first step before going harder on the restrictions , cos as you describe it its just ridiculous :o, 
  only if you are  20 though . 
  thank you for the reply , i believe so too , since i didnt find something on google 's first page :p, 
  i guess you dont agree with my phrase , no need to argue over it . 
  call it whatever you like , in my book the phrase i used is fair . 
  my thoughts exactly , i thought us uses bases in iraq at the moment , could n't they use them too instead of jordan ? 
  germany accepted patiently all the slaps in the face for about 3-4 times . 
  they are not a small time player to be treated like that . 
  erdogan knew exactly where his actions would lead , the blame ( if there is any ) is on him . 
  of course its a serious downgrade on the 2 countries relations , but not the end of the world to consider it `` ditching '' . 
  also , lets not forget where the turko-russian relations were after the sukhoi downing and where they are now .
