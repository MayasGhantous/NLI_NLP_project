  cool names !, 
  i would prefer to see a stronger ship called vezuvio though !, 
  they enable cheats/hacks to fight him !, 
  damn carl , do n't reveal our super weapons !, 
  pharmaceutical companies of his time hated him !, 
  maybe i am wrong , i just have my doubts that turkey 's importance to nato ( or from russia 's pov ) is just to be near in russia for launching nukes like the guy above considers . 
  turkey is not in nato just for nato to have bases in its soil , it has a whole army as well to take into consideration, 
  well , i am sure nato and us can always set red lines in that russia-turkey relation . 
  and if they cross them , all that us-made war equipment they have will gradually turn useless without spare parts etc. 
  but i am sure we are far away from such a deterioration of relationships , erdogan is smart enough ( ? ), 
  to not walk that extra mile and ruin country 's relationship with usa , nato etc, 
  you think distance matters that much nowadays in nuke wars ? 
  agree , but cant say the same about the crown :(, 
  so close to pension , sad story, 
  cant blame those policemen . 
  obviously this situation was n't anticipated and hadnt sent the appropriate forces . 
  and this probably was taken into consideration when those bodyguards attacked the protesters , that police could n't hold them back . 
  but if you consider that something similar had happened last year again with erdogan 's security detail , it was definitely poor planning from the police headquarters, 
  well , at least summer day up there has ( so ) many hours for weather to make it up to you !, 
  damn , i always wanted to see colosseum in action !, 
  its due to puns like that , that the belgian nationalists will invade the european parliament and take over the uk 's seats . 
  oh wait , i might be wrong with that :d, 
  :d ok , i will let you first when the mbga campaign starts in belgium :p, 
  trump miga : make italy great again !, 
  the guy answered you already , the germans did too when they said `` greece was living beyond its means '' : the other countries * can * afford their spendings ( whatever it may be ) , while we couldnt . 
  we were borrowing to keep up those social benefits ( health , pensions , oversized public sector etc etc ) , and in the meantime only the stupid paying taxes . 
  of course it was a ( big ) part of the problem . 
  ~ 8 years now and you still fail to identify the mistakes done for so long . 
  instead of focusing that he loses `` democracy war '' in his country , he cares more about the `` propaganda war '' on western media . 
  it is suspicious , but the post itself looks not written by a non-turk . 
  perhaps he initiated in english because he wants the outcome of that thread to be some copy-pasta propaganda texts in english . 
  edit : checked now , many posts in r/turkey are in english, 
  thats more to my taste !, 
  * spamming the upvote button *, 
  hey , big fan of your posts here . 
  i dont see a plane in this one , do n't know how to feel :( :p, 
  understand , my perception was way too wrong i guess !, 
  understand , my assumption was wrong i guess, 
  ah ok , my bad i guess . 
  not so deep into politics , was thinking that * especially * the kurds would not like him, 
  ah ok , my bad i guess . 
  not so deep into politics , was thinking that * especially * the kurds would not like him, 
  in the meantime in us , you open trump 's twitter and you get casual comments like [ that ] ( http://imgur.com/a/0bjtb ) on his tweets , on top of the replies list . 
  the guy is still alive and out of prison !, 
  `` good night '' is equally legit to say for such an occasion . 
  but `` good morning '' is more warm , while `` good night '' is more ironic/offensive  have a good afternoon :p, 
  i am out of words for that guy ... how can this guy still get 51 % in the latest referendum ? 
  and assuming the 20 million kurds didnt vote for him , that means erdogan is still very popular among turks , right ? 
  hmm , to be honest and being a classic rock fan , its first time i hear of septicflesh , regarding rotting christ i just know they . . exist , 
  holy moly , why i didnt know of that version for all this time ?!, 
  not a list , but here [ is one i consider a tier1 pop song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezdxvht4ll8 ), 
  but this fund is about funding new arm deals , right ? 
  and who will be deciding what is needed ? 
  shouldnt this fund be done in parallel with the establishment of a central defensive agency or something to control that fund ? 
  i cant see how this will work : s, 
  have 1000 beers and then come tell me if you do n't visualize beautiful places too \\ ^ ^, 
  what is different is the scale of the clashes and the fact that this year we have footage of it . 
  agree that it sounds more scary with trump , but lets be honest , obama looked the other way at that incident too . 
  in fact , various downings have taken place , some were called `` accidents '' or really were . 
  but there is at least one ( according to my knowledge , i dont follow up these intensively ) that has been acknowledged , back in 1996 . it was retaliation to the imia incident that had happened a few months before that . 
  [ more here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/r.550_magic#greece ), 
  its not just defense tests . 
  its a daily reminder that we have land disputes with you . 
  this is a valid argument for the last 2-3 years that the syrian immigrant crisis is happening . 
  but the violation issues with turkey are happening for decades now , and no external assistance has been given for this constant `` bullying '' . . i guess nobody wants to slap erdogan 's face now , everybody looks the other way at this , unless he walks the extra mile and becomes war-greedy ( which imo is not his intention , not for at least the next 5 + years ) . 
  so , i guess we will have to patiently accept his bullying , until further notice \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  what turkey did to russia was pre-approved by nato though . 
  if you remember the incident , they downed the plane and first guy to come out and talk about it was nato secretary , to back turkey on this ( mighty sultan erdogan was hiding for days ) . 
  obviously , greece is not allowed ( and should n't imo ) do it . 
  but a stronger political resolution from eu/nato countries would help i guess , which i dont see it likely to happen now , given the situation with the syrian refugees . 
  so , we will have to put up with their crap until something important happens ... 
  i agree with you . 
  but probably you will agree with me too , that if someone ca n't discriminate an . exe photo or . exe song from a real photo/song , then he is in for a potential hacking incident , waiting to happen as he browses and clicks and downloads anything he sees . . no matter what antivirus you have , nothing can protect you 100 % if you do n't know and follow some essential rules , that 's my opinion at least . 
  how is xss attacks related to downloading an actual file to your pc ? 
  xss is about submitting forms , cant get a virus infected file like that * and not realize it * and then actually run it, 
  some people just like to open any mail they receive , download any . exe photos they can find !, 
   and i presume when your country was separated from the internationally acknowledge soil of the ottoman empire when it was formed , then it was a `` real '' liberation ? 
  the 2 cases are different , in my opinion , there is no historical context to back turkish soil on balkans ( of course it was part of ottoman empire , but belonged to others before that , and we are , more or less , back to that state now ) . 
  i keep saying to myself : if i ever have to go abroad , i need to open a freddo/frappe place and eventually be successful since these beverages have huge potential . 
  now i know chicago is already taken , i take it off my list :p, 
  i will take a wild guess and say that your name probably has a g ? 
  because out of all the countries you mentioned , i feel greek sounds more similar to spanish , and spaniards cant pronounce g well ( manager =  `` manayer '' i find it funny every time i hear it :p ), 
  man , you need to come by again for the frappe v2 that we have the last years , its called `` freddo espresso/cappuccino '' . 
  if you are into coffees , you will love it ^ ^ [ obligatory photo ] ( http://www.minutca.gr/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/img_6374.jpg ), 
  imo , `` liberation '' is a poor word selection . 
  if for any reason , these guys dont enjoy being there , they are free to leave and go to turkey , if thats what they wish . 
  but asking to be `` liberated '' on bulgaria 's internationally acknowledged soil , can not be justified by any means . 
  if they feel more turks than bulgarians , then their motherland is a few miles east . 
  maybe i am wrong , but i have this opinion : up to a few years ago , turkey was not a better place ( comparing to balkans i mean ) to live . 
  now that turkey is on the rise ( financially speaking ) , perhaps many of them will decide to move there , so these minorities will start to decline . 
  maybe this is happening already, 
  perhaps icbm was on sale ?!? 
  also , buy 1 today and you get priest blessing for free ?!, 
  this belongs to r/bestof, 
   black slave and i - judging by the body language - thought he was an angry customer , probably due to waiting for his order for too long :p, 
  spectacular fireworks !, 
  what were they celebrating ?!, 
   the moment serbia recognises kosovo ( which they have too as part of the saa ) is n't that moment a few light years away ? 
  37c this weekend , start filling those planes in guys , summer is around the corner !, 
  nice !,
