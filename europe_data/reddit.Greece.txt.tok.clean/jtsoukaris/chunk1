indeed , \u039a\u039f\u039c\u0399\u039e was one of the best magazines with stories from disney not only in greece but in the whole europe . 
  excellent print quality , great selection of rare stories etc. 
  in 2013 , 25 years have passed since the first issue . 
  wow , we have grown up a lot !, 
  ** greece : ** one more victim of the crisis , the publisher behind the greek editions of disney 's magazines is forced [ to cease its publications , effective immediately ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2013/08/31/mickey-mouse-mag-stops-48-year-run/ ) . 
  nothing else really matters to me this week . 
  not at all . 
  i am atheist myself . 
  i ca n't tell about all the religions . 
  as far as it concerns ancient greece , surviving myths like the sacrifice of king agamemnon 's daughter iphigenia allow us to conclude that human sacrifice was practiced during the dark ages ( before the classical age ) but it was n't widespread . 
  they are . 
  are you willing to be burned alive or otherwise sacrificed in order the reenactment of the ancient rituals to be more plausible ( and even more fun ) ? 
  i wonder who they asked in this survey . 
  about 75 % of people aged between 18 and 35 consider immigrating ( most of them to germany ) . 
  200.000 families are jobless . 
  the unemployment is over 27 % and a large number of those who still have a job do n't get paid in time ( with the average delay to be 4-5 months , not just days ) . 
  you must be leaving in a cave not to see the countless who suffer . 
  even i , who consider myself happy ( just because i still have a well paid job and i can provide for my family ) , feel bad every day with all this suffering . 
  bbc and deutsche welle are down as well . 
  to add salt to the wound the morons in the unions called for a strike in the private tv and radio stations between 19:00 and 01:00 . 
  so for the moment we do n't have an alternate source of information . 
  they cut the phone lines . 
  while i do believe that the state tv was a source of corruption and a reform was past necessary , the practices followed by the government do not befit to a democratic state . 
  edit : the end for the web stream too . 
  the end . 
  only available through the web . 
  the stream is suffering due to huge numbers of users trying to tune in . 
  technicians assisted by riot police are removing the transmitters one by one . 
  only 2 state tv channels are still broadcasting in part of athens . 
  broadcasting stopped in the rest of the country . 
  worth a shot . 
  personally speaking , i am in favor of the euro . 
  i have worked like a slave for over 15 years ( i am 34 now ) and i managed to build some savings . 
  a return to a devalued drachma would have been disastrous for me . 
  do n't get me misunderstood , i wish you all the best . 
  just keep your expectations low . 
  because we also had so many expectations but so few fulfilled . 
  we have been badly hurt by the euro . 
  and you are telling me that you really expect to become richer by entering the ez ? 
  oh , i suddenly realize that the citizens of a north-eastern european country are going to be surprised ( read : disappointed / shocked ) . 
  pay no attention though , i am not referring to you . 
  not at all . 
   eu commission invited latvia to join the eurozone . 
  switch to euro incoming next year . 
  f *** yes !, 
  a new lender eerr ... 
  i meant partner . 
  should i write you down for 5 billion euros or you intent to contibute more ? 
  fresh article reveals the kind of desperation i was talking about yesterday ( google translate ) : [ owners in despair : they exchange their homes with ... taxi licenses ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=el&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.imerisia.gr%2farticle.asp%3fcatid%3d27198%26subid%3d2%26pubid%3d113054729 ), 
  in fact the government wants to attract foreign property investors . 
  before becoming one yourself , keep in mind that the tax policy here changes often ( and it is unfair ) . 
  new property taxes maybe be introduced at any time . 
  there are a lot of opportunities now in athens . 
  many homeowners are in difficult / desperate financial position and willing to accept lower rents for their property . 
  in addition , to make things worse , the government introduced a heavy tax last year imposed on every property owner . 
  as a result , many homeowners want their properties to be rented just in order to be able to pay the new tax . 
   that 's it ? 
  it 's 300 + utilities ? 
  no local surcharges , service charges , participation/hoa fees ... ? 
  exactly , utilities are n't included . 
  there is also a low municipal tax paid through the electricity bill . 
  finally the renter is responsible to cover the cost for some repairs . 
  after the emergence of the crisis in 2010 , many immigrants left the country followed by many locals ( who immigrated mostly to western and northern europe ) . 
  the number of flats available for rent has increased considerably since then while the average rent dropped between 30 % -40 % ( and still there are a lot of empty apartments ) . 
  i now pay only 300 $ per month for a large ( 90m2 ) , relatively newly-built flat in a decent neighborhood of athens with a nearby metro station . 
  3 years ago that would have been a joke . 
  last week a close friend rented a 130m2 apartment for 300 $ ( challenge accepted , i am going to find something bigger and cheaper ) . 
  just a piece of advice for those young tourists ( not you ) from northern europe who travel in large groups and spend their vacations in mykonos , rhodes , zakynthos and elsewhere drinking all day and night ( i am looking at you dear chavs ) . 
  this summer we expect more tourists than ever ( about 18.000.000 people , an all-time high ) . 
  please do yourself a great favour and do not consume what they serve at shitty bars . 
  most probably they are impure drinks , dangerous for your health ( we call them `` bombs '' ) . 
  choose only bottled drinks like beer . 
  these are safe . 
  actually these people get what they deserve , because they book their vacations through travel agencies which promise them all night drinking for 5 $ . 
  to give you a perspective , 5 $ is the price for one drink only in reputable bars ( down from 8-10 $ before the crisis ) . 
  then again we want everyone to have a great time here , so enjoy your vacations and drink responsibly . 
  in greece there are frequent campaigns to follow the [ mediterranean diet ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mediterranean_diet ) which includes many fruits and vegetables . 
  but we do not have a motto similar to five a day . 
  this is true even today . 
  although it 's illegal to sell alcohol to underaged people ( under 18 ) , the reality is that children/teenagers can buy alcohol almost everywhere . 
  in the rare occasion where someone asks a child / teenager `` are n't you too young to be buying alcohol ? 
  '' , they just answer `` oh , it is not for me , it is for my parents '' . 
  curiously , alcoholism is n't a significant problem here . 
  while i do have a ( very very ) bad opinion about tsipras , i did n't criticise him on this occasion . 
  the adjective i used was ** funny ** . 
  if you though that my comment was criticism and you ca n't stand criticism about tsipras , i am sorry but 1 . 
  i ca n't help you and 2 . 
  i will continue to freely express my opinion . 
  funny : at the same festival ( that with slavoj \u017di\u017eek ) opposition leader alexis tsipras [ confused canadian writer naomi klein to naomi campbell ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yqfof3xt0m ) . 
  greece : the fastest option available to consumers is vdsl , 50mbps up/5 mpbs down or 30mbps / 3 mbps . 
  most common are adsl connections , 24 mbps up / 1 mbps . 
  there are no caps of any sort . 
  plans for a countrywide fiber optic network have been postponed for the moment due to the crisis . 
  prices vary : naked adsl costs ~ 17 $ / month , 10 $ more for vdsl . 
  more consumers though opt for for double play ( telephony and internet ) or triple play ( telephony , internet , tv ) bundles . 
  a triple play bundle costs between 30 $ and 40 $ / month . 
  as for mobile internet access , 4g / lte packages are offered for about 35 $ / month with a 20gb usage cap . 
  i see ... then seals may be correct . 
  in greece at least the female equivalent to \u0391\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03ad\u03b1\u03c2 is n't \u0391\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03ad\u03b1 but \u0391\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1 ( adriana ) . 
  \u0391\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03ad\u03b1\u03c2 is a common greek male name .
