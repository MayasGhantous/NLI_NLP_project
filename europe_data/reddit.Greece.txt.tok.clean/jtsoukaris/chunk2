   nikita this name is used in greece too ( \u039d\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 , male , not so common anymore ) . 
  the origin of the name is greek too ( from the famous ancient greek orator \u039d\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 ) . 
  never met or heard anyone with that name . 
  also the word \u03a6\u03bb\u03ce\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 has a bad meaning ( in greece , i am not sure about cyprus ) . 
  most of the names of ancient greek origin are unique . 
  for instance : * \u0391\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd ( apollo - male , rare ) , * \u039f\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03ad\u03b1\u03c2 ( ulysses / odysseus , male ) , * \u0391\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd\u03ac ( athina / minerva , female ) , * \u0386\u03c1\u03c4\u03b5\u03bc\u03b9\u03c2 ( artemis / diana , female ) * \u0391\u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03b4\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 ( aphrodite , female ) . 
  almost all the names of latin and christian / hebrew origin are common to other european languages . 
  greece took part between 1993 and 1999 . 
  the show was popular here . 
  we won just three times - never in a final . 
  once greece hosted a round . 
  i wanted so much to be there and i managed to be . 
  but all the games ( designed by a popular greek cartoonist ) were awful and there were 30-40 minute delays after each game . 
  the episodes ' duration was 1 hour and 25 minutes . 
  we were there for over 4 hours . 
  go ahead and drink all you can while you can , before they rename your wine to something not cool . 
  in any case these are minor issues . 
  a compromise will be achieved between the interested countries for sure . 
  important thing is : we are very happy you joined the eu . 
  not only that , but we ( greeks ) are ready to immediately accept you to the eurozone as well . 
  we are constantly looking for new ~ ~ lenders ~ ~ partners to wholeheartedly welcome them to our common project in our continent . 
  the greek side of the story : two years before that event ( 1912 ) the balkan wars broke out . 
  we were the overall winners of these wars , achieving significant terrotorials gains thanks to our navy ( it liberated all the aegean islands still in the hands of the turks and prevented them from bringing rainforcements from asia to the various fronts through the sea allowing our army to liberate most of epirus and macedonia regions ) . 
  the ottoman authorities anticipated that and ordered these ships to shift the balance of power in the aegean sea and retake the islands they just lost . 
  in turn , when the greek authorities ( venizelos , the prime minister and metaxas , the chief of staff ) heard the news about this order , both came into despair . 
  the knew our navy were n't a match against these ships and started planning to destroy them while en route to constantinople ( istanbul ) , enacting a new war against the ottomans . 
  and they were very happy when they learned that , finally , the british were n't going to deliver the ships . 
  apparently marrying without a prenuptial agreement is a form of suicide in belgium , portugal or hungary . 
  it is . 
  being under the ottoman rule for over 400 years , greeks of the late 18th / the 19th century were obsessed with the ideal of freedom . 
  in 1814 , in odessa ( located in russia ) [ \u03a6\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0395\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 ( filiki eteria - society of friends ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/filiki_eteria ) was founded with the task to prepare the [ greek war of independence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_war_of_independence ) . 
  their motto was `` freedom or death '' . 
  freedom was a popular topic in all arts . 
  the verses of our national anthem hail freedom and are taken from a poem titled [ hymn to liberty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hymn_to_liberty ) . 
  even today \u0395\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 is a common female first name . 
  the male form \u0395\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03b8\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 also exists but it is n't as popular . 
  the number of stripes our flag has matches the number of the syllables in the phrase `` freedom or death '' , in greek \u0395\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03ae \u0398\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 ( eleftheria \u03b9 thanatos ) . 
  the blue stripes symbolize the sky while the white ones symbolize the sea foam . 
  the cross you know what . 
  and why someone would consider buying cfl bulbs when led lamps are available ? 
  they are even more energy efficient and cost effective in the long run . 
  pretty much every greek radio station is available online . 
  i think you are going to like : * http://nowradio.gr * http://www.offradio.gr/ * http://www.easy972.gr/ the most popular radio networks with many stations to choose from are : * http://chromaradio.gr/ * http://www.radioart.com/ ( excellent but with many ads for the non-premium listeners ) . 
  both are very popular beyond greece . 
  all these stations play mostly english music . 
  if you want to listen to something in greek , listen to : * http://www.melodia.gr/ * http://www.diesi.gr/ * http://www.rythmosfm.gr/, 
  hdp supporters are very active in athens ( and in the rest of the country i suppose ) ahead of the elections . 
  they target greeks and kurds who hold turkish passports ( they are allowed to vote in the turkish consulate ) . 
  they represent themselves as seekers of peaceful coexistence between the various ethnic and religious minorities and communities in turkey as well as defenders of their rights . 
  in their posters the slogan `` against the war of the palace '' is prevalent . 
  does the aforementioned service publish statistical data ? 
  for instance : * how many cases they handle each year ? 
  * how many children are taken from their families ? 
  * what percentage of them are from norwegian and what of families with foreign origin ( also , what is the proportion of the immigrants in the total population in norway ) ? 
  * a break up of the reasons etc. 
  ok ok , if you insist , you may keep your baklava ( you may also keep your damn ekmek kaday\u0131f\u0131 ice-cream which i also love but , like baklava , it is a calorie bomb ) . 
  when i can pass by to take constantinople ( always an expert at negotiation talks . 
  i managed to fulfill a centuries-long dream without a spill of blood shed ) ? 
   no , we want baklava . 
  before further progress can be made you have to admit that baklava is of greek origin ( no matter if it is true ) . 
  most of the women keep it . 
  but for a man to keep it , he either has to serve in the turkish army or to buy off ( not sure if this is the correct english verb ) his service time ( the cost is about 5.000 $ ) . 
  there is no incentive for that since the greek passport is an eu passport which allows freedom of movement within the eu , legal immigration without visas etc while the turkish one is n't . 
  if it was the other way around many more would have kept it . 
  well , i left turkey with my parents in 1984 having bad memories . 
  bad the years passed , the greek - turkish relationships got better since then , i visited turkey several times in the meantime and i got used to like it . 
  i also have many turkish friends . 
  and my parents decided to get back to imbros after the crisis started here . 
  they managed to make a new start and created a decent living for themselves . 
  i was born in gokceada ( imbros ) . 
  one of the last rums born there ( in 1979 ) . 
  you can imagine the rest . 
  * country : greece * favourite neighbour : turkey ( i was born there ) * least favourite neighbour : fyro `` m '', 
  i think you are overestimating our relationship with russia a bit . 
  they cooled their interest for investments after the cancellation of burgas - alexandroupolis pipeline project . 
  and they did n't even lift / relax their embargo for our agricultural products ( although i accept that it would have been difficult to make an exemption solely for us ) . 
  of course they ( and their money ) are always welcome . 
  anyway , it seems strange ( even funny ) to us reading all these comments from other eastern europeans fearing a russian aggression . 
  we can not perceive russia as a threat . 
  but then again we were lucky never being ussr slaves like them . 
  although russia is and it always will be a ( quite ) friendly country ( due to historical ties and the common religion ) , it can not be considered an ally . 
  despite attempts from tsipras to receive economic aid from russia last spring , poutin made clear once more that russia is n't interested to take the geopolitical risks required ( along with the financial cost ) to make us switch from eu / nato to their side . 
  i think that currently we can not consider a single country as an ally . 
  our alliances lie with the eu and nato . 
  but we should continue the efforts we started ~ 10 years ago to build an alliance with israel ( first and foremost ) and egypt ( after sisi 's ascension ) . 
  we share common interests with them in the mediterranean . 
  the greek news story is about an 8.2 richter earthquake that rocked eastern russia . 
  op , we 'll see if you a jinx . 
  but why is that you government does n't consider reforming your anti-terrorism legislation ? 
  do they fear that such a reform will leave you vulnerable in some way ? 
  poor obelix ... 
  many greeks would be disappointed that we are n't included in the top 5 friends . 
  if they polled greeks , almost everyone would include russia in his/hers top 5 ( usually as the no1 ) . 
  also a bit surprised that serbia is n't included . 
  damn you germans . 
  we can hear them screaming from the other side of the aegean . 
  we wo n't get a moment 's sleep tonight . 
  just kidding, 
  breathtaking but according to a national geographic documentary i watched a few years ago , the whole area is collapsing . 
  the process is irreversible and the only thing the archaeologists can do is to postpone it .
