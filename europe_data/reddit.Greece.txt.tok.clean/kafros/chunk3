  no-one needs a report from bank of greece to know the dangers of not getting a deal , but nonetheless , it is the duty of the bank to publish the report . 
  the chairman of the greek parliament , `` sent the report back '' , saying it is unacceptable . 
  the government sided with her , calling out the president of bank of greece for foul play , fear-mongering and an anti-greek stance of their work on the committee . 
  one parliament member of the governing party , is going to sue him tomorrow ( rahil makri ) ... my country is run by clowns :-(, 
  putin said no to cyprus when they were begging for much less money , and while russian economy was in a much better shape . 
  putin has said no 2 times so far to tsipras , with the latest reply being along the lines : get a deal with eu . 
  tsipras lives in dreamland , and his voters in retard-land . 
  even if putin wanted to help , he ca n't . 
  his finances are not that good and he has enough problems on his plate . 
  lets assume for a second a scenario where the committee prevents any payment demands by bond holders . 
  what does this mean practically for future loans ? 
  how can a bond buyer be sure that his bond is not declared `` odious '' by the next government ? 
  the result will be practically the same as any default : exclusion from money markets . 
  there are no easy solutions to the greek debt problem , this whole committee is a `` smoke and mirrors '' trick for the natives . 
  tomorrow greece will issue its new bonds with a yield less than german bonds , as it is now debt free . 
  economists from around the world , hail mrs. kostantopoulou ( president of the committee and chairman of the greek parliament ) on her ground breaking financial idea . 
  her nobel prize is in the works as i type these words . 
  tl ; dr : we have gone full retard . 
  sad thing is , many of my compatriots believe this type of bullshit and wait for the debt to magically disappear :-(, 
  have you seen a 5 year old throwing a fit because their parents said no ? 
  greece is in the same spot . 
  we fail to see the balance of power ( eu has the money , and eu is setting the rules ) . 
  on this post i go into details : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3a553r/greece_blames_everybody_but_itself_for_its/cs9g445 but lets keep it eli5 : after all is said and done , there is a deal on the table . 
  the deal sits on the table for the last 5 months while greece is crying its eyes out for a better deal . 
  when the deal expires , greece dies . 
  the greek government believes that eu is bluffing , and the greek voters support their government . 
  tl ; dr : cake or death ? 
  death please https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnjcuz-lisy, 
  i will repeat my question  find me ** one party that sided ** with papandreou on his referendum idea, 
  if we default , the blame game helps clearing oneself from any liability . 
  if greece fails , people are going to starve . 
  syriza is preparing to point the finger to eu . 
  clever syriza , stupid voters . 
  eu is washing its hands like pontius pilate, 
  the current narrative in greece is that eu is trying to bend the `` peoples will and democratic vote '' . 
  this is how syriza got elected : a premise on which the sheer power of will ( the vote of citizens ) can trump over economical reality , and provide us with the extra money needed to stop austerity . 
  austerity in greece is viewed as a choice , not as a result of a poor state that can not gather enough taxes to pay its own expenses . 
  this narrative is clashing with reality during the last 4 months of syriza government and the results are showing : 1 . 
  bank deposits have left the country ~ 40bn euro 2 . 
  greek 2y bond yield at 30 % 3 . 
  banks on continuous ela support unable to lend to the economy for new business activity 4 . 
  state owning more than 4.5 bn euro to its vendors reality always wins . 
  if syriza continues this way , we will default and experience the `` wonders '' of currency devaluation . 
  we are playing this game like idiots , the whole eu , and usa are against us . 
  china and russia do n't want to take part and have explicitly said so, 
  the greek parliament replaced him , not eu !, 
  all parties were against the referendum including his own . 
  even the communist kke was against whilst this was their only chance to make their dream come true ( an exit from eu ) . 
  find me one party that sided with papandreou on his referendum idea , and then we can talk about foreign intervention . 
  procedure is normality to you , but not to us greeks . 
  everything can be `` solved '' by talking to the right person . 
  this extends to politics too . 
  tsipras 6 months ago : `` go home mrs. merkel '' varoufakis today : `` please help mrs. merkel '' greece voted for clowns , and everyone is now enjoying the show . 
  varoufakis does not seem to understand how eu works . 
  merkel is not the `` boss '' of a megacorp called `` eu '' to give her blessing and solution . 
  tsipras is stuck in his own bullshit pre-election propaganda . 
  he has promised too much and can not back down easily against his voters . 
  two scenarios : 1 . 
  he places his party above the country , puts the `` blame '' on eu , defaults and greece gets fucked beyond repair . 
  he does master theartics to save face in front of his voters , show them that he `` put a good fight '' , and then agree to eu demands . 
  i find scenario ( 2 ) much more probable . 
  you do n't know syriza voters . 
  they have the deluded dream that we can stay in the euro without doing any reforms . 
   you should try getting informed by sources the proposed cuts are on the table by troika ( for 1 % to 1.5 % surplus ) . 
  the devaluation of 50 % is very modest with bank of greece 's report which puts it at 70 % . 
  i think bank of greece is quite informed on the matter . 
   how ridiculous the proposal is evident by how many international well-esteemed economists like stiglitz , krugman , legrain unanimously agree that a default , even though painful we have a saying in greek : 100 lashes on another guy 's ass , are not that painful . 
  syriza has two economists : varoufakis and lapavitsas , the later being a drachma proponent . 
  both agree on one thing : returning to the drachma will be very very painful . 
   the government needs to protect the currency lol , the currency will float to a point that reflects greek production ( which is shit at the moment ) . 
  industry needs years to build the infrastructure and start pumping products . 
  setting the exchange rate instead of letting the market decide , always leads to black market currency and lack of imported goods . 
  venezuela says hi !, 
  of course there is a limit : at some point the constraints are worse than a default . 
  we are not there yet . 
  at the moment we are asked to make wage cuts of 5-10 % in order to avoid a default with a devaluation of 50 % . 
  the choice is simple : make the fucking cuts . 
  in the future the choice may be different , but for now the choice is clear, 
  a majority does not imply a democracy . 
  companies are run by majority shareholders and at the same time they are a far cry from being deemed democratic . 
  my point still holds . 
  18 countries in a majority opinion have decided to hold on to commitments made in 2012 . 
  when i say free money , i mean `` free '' from reforms . 
  these money is below market interest and come with constraints . 
  syriza does not want any constraints and so we get no money so far, 
  the majority always has the final say . 
  eu said no more free money , get your shit together, 
  electoral results in the rest of eu countires are also taken into account , thus the previous agreements have to hold . 
  we made ourselves unproductive . 
  the eu gave the subsidies to us to expand , we decided to pocket the money . 
  you can not lie ( or tell the truth ) about future events with many different outcomes . 
  your question is nonsensical . 
  example : today , i declare that there will be rain in athens on the 30th of july . 
  am i lying or telling the truth ? 
  ( this question has no meaning , because no-one knows . 
  the question will be answered on the 30th ) . 
  what the imf did was this : they assumed a scenario that suited the lending of greece . 
  the scenario was about greek performance ** in the future ** . 
  they ignored a conservative scenario where greece performs totally shit , and applied an optimistic scenario where greece does ok . 
  in hindsight , sitting on our comfy chairs in the future of this decision , it is very easy to point a finger and say `` haha noobs , i would have chosen a bad scenario '' .
