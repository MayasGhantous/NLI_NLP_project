  ** edit : ** the question that imf answered in their models was this : how much will the greek gdp contract , if they stop getting 20 billion euro per year from bonds ? 
  ( the 20bn is greece 's budget needs of 2009 without debt and interest payments ) . 
  our economic models can not answer much simpler questions , imagine what the answer is to the above . 
  i can assume ( 1 ) that imf chose the range that allowed rescuing us from bankruptcy . 
  ( 1 ) emphasis on assume . 
  noone knows how they modeled the economy, 
  who keeps passing the reviews ? 
  syriza has denied troika access to the review material . 
  the word review contains `` view '' , you can not review if you are blind away from facts . 
  the error in the multiplier shows how good imf was to us in their review . 
  the situation was much worse , but they all turned a blind eye and lend us the money . 
  if they got the multiplier `` right '' we would have defaulted on the spot . 
  this conversation we are having would rotate on topics of nutrition via photosynthesis, 
  greece ca n't be trusted . 
  the trust has evaporated during the last 4 decades . 
  if he wants money he has to build the trust even though he was not the one to break the trust . 
  on a side note , varoufakis continuous swings of opinion do not help europeans ( or anyone ) to take him seriously . 
  lately his `` ideas '' take about 2 hours to be denied or overturned -- not good ... 
  do you disagree with the info in my post ? 
  have you really forgotten about pasok of the 80s ? 
  yes my illiterate friend , for 4 decades we did this trick . 
  during the 80s greece got eu money in order to build infrastructure , agriculture and industry . 
  what did pasok do with this money ? 
  distributed it among the party ranks . 
  here , have some love , upvote, 
   so , if our government is willing to embrace the reforms that our partners expect , why have the negotiations not produced an agreement ? 
  where is the sticking point ? 
  the sticking point is trust : eu and imf do not trust us . 
  all sounds good and sparkly , but for 4 decades we have pulled the same trick . 
  we made promises to change , we got the money , passed laws and failed to implement them . 
  the broken trust was created by the previous government , but it remains . 
  a change of government does not restore trust , but actions can . 
  trust is build day by day by agreeing on something and delivering it . 
  if varoufakis wants some love from eu , he has to show that he means business : pass laws that change the way greece operates , implement the laws , and 6 months later invite the troika to audit and show that he is serious . 
  on even calendar days syriza is not paying , on the rest it is paying :-) the planet is amused, 
  we are deleted for each other from a mod probably, 
  nope . 
  yours show as deleted . 
  link me to your comment, 
  syriza has threatened to not pay the imf on every occasion since its election , but it always backed down and paid . 
  they know that pissing off the planet ( in addition to the eu ) is not a good idea . 
  syriza is only empty promises and threats . 
  all monetary systems are flawed . 
  also : bears shit in the woods and the sky is blue . 
  eu had rules for state deficits in order to keep things in check and have a stable system . 
  what they lacked was auditing ( troika ) and a whip ( ecb ) . 
  eu learned the hard way that looking the other way while a country ( greece for example ) is running a 10 % deficit , is not sustainable . 
  so we now have troika auditing all eu members and making sure that deficits are in check . 
  we also have ecb with very specific rules on the amount of money that a state can borrow from its own banks . 
  there were/are problems , and there will always be problems . 
  the rules are changed in order to have a better system , and so far it seems this is working for countries that follow the rules, 
  do you mean my comment in which you thought i was calling the economist far-left media ( lol ) ? 
  yes , i mean the one that you deleted because you were called out for its immense stupidity . 
  why do n't you bring it back and let reddit admire your intellect ? 
  current government thinking : we need money , how about we boost tourism for this coming season ? 
  ministry of tourism : good idea , we will make a video relevant to 30 % of our tourists . 
  cue laugh track tl ; dr : current government has gone full retard . 
  shit back and enjoy the comedy :-(, 
  the deal has already be made : 18 countries told greece that it has to implement specific reforms if it wants money . 
  it is a yes of no thing , but tsipras believes that a last minute miracle will give him unconditional money . 
  tl : dr : we are fucked, 
  it is a good thing , but you do n't have leverage as i said before . 
  varoufakis ca n't have both : a system that forces citizens to pay on time and at the same time does not send them to jail for delaying payments, 
  irs will take you to court and you may get sentenced if you delay for too long . 
  the important point is that you need a law for sentencing : jail time for x amount for y months . 
  syriza is not fond of sending people to jail for small amounts . 
  this means that up to x amount , the state has not leverage for forcing payment on time . 
  this program has `` ended '' 3 times so far :-) this time is really really really going to end , no joke guys we mean it . 
  let me tell you a story : all of the times that this `` trick '' was used in greece , there was a promise from the acting government that it was the last time . 
  ** edit : ** what he proposes ( a greek irs ) does not solve the problem of citizens delaying payments while they wait for the next time this `` trick '' is used again . 
  the irs will just assign tax amounts , it can not force collection . 
  only police can , and then you will need to reimplement the law that takes you to jail for a debt of 5000euros, 
  we did something very dirty in order to increase revenue : tax office removed all fines and interest from delayed payments , if you paid all your due taxes . 
  this is a good incentive for gathering money due , and a big disincentive for future on-time payments by the citizens . 
  why pay on time when you see that the state is forced for liquidity and will accept payment without extra charges at any later date,

  i said `` trying '' . 
  our government is in dreamland , do n't wake them up, 
  greece is trying to play eu against imf . 
  oh we are so clever / s i can see this one ending in tears ( our tears that is ) our government is trapped in its pre-election promises . 
  they seem to be unable to back down from what the said to the voters , and eu does not give any money . 
  without any options , they are throwing the ball off-court . 
  if we are to close the gold mine , why havent we closed the nickel mine years ago too ? 
  oh right , this is a state industry , thus clean :-) how about our clean coal mines ? 
  these are polluting multiple times as the gild mine . 
  added bonus : it goes up the athmosphere, 
  things are much simpler than the conspiracy theories you write . 
  if greece is given even 1 euro more , this has to be contributed by all eu members as per eu regulations and agreements . 
  some eu members are poorer than greece . 
  you will have a situation where the poor are forced to give to the rich ( greece ) it is no mystery why smaller countries make the biggest opposition to greece . 
  it is impossible for them to pass such a decision through their parliaments . 
  the greek state is only paying salaries and pensions . 
  any money due to state suppliers or citizens via tax returns , is currently frozen . 
  syriza is so focused on the task that they let themos anastasiadis walk free . 
  this guy was caught with 3mil euro in his pocket on his way to switcherland . 
  the let go was done during the 3 months of syriza 's governance . 
  but please , dont let facts distract you from cheering the monkey show currently running greece to the ground, 
  measure a piece of land ?
