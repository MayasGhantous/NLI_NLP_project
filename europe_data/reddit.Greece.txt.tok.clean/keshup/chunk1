oh great , are we going to have our own south now ? 
  `` god bless ` urope '', 
  i got that shit twice . 
  thankfully one was n't an heir . 
  the other one did n't manage to rule ; he died and his father married his widow . 
  i 'm asking if there 's a policy to be chill about it so to speak . 
  not laws . 
  like u/msastrid said . 
  in the mean time , is there a policy that at least stops doctors and patients from being arrested for it ? 
   europe 2098 , sch\u00e4uble i sure hope not . 
  old fuckface should retire already . 
  he 's got a point . 
  elephants are smart animals . 
  it 's hard to stay calm if one of the options is `` perish . '', 
  and i thought daenerys had a long title . 
  imposters from the non-holy non-roman and non-empire still have n't left those claims behind i see . 
  everyone knows the only logical capital for the ~ ~ roman empire ~ ~ european union is rome . 
  edit : [ u ] lm is the only germanic town worth mentioning as a candidate . 
  supposedly they want sharia and general islamisation , but how they think they are gon na make us accept it by killing us and making us more pissed at them is another story . 
  dumb people . 
  150 jews in andora ? 
  that 's like half their population . 
  as opposed to ugly generalising ? 
  current president of the us totally supports leave , and he * is * the system . 
  and theresa `` i 'm the british hillary clinton and support whatever the polls show '' may is n't much better . 
  i did n't `` want '' anything . 
  i 'm just discussing this article . 
  but i 'll bite , uk simply had stupid excuses to leave . 
  italy , greece and spain had/have much better reasons . 
  pretty sure the uk already had control over who entered into their country , that 's why lots of migrants got stuck in calais . 
  lack of proper vetting for people entering the eu is an issue that can and should be discussed and fixed . 
  but no , that 's not uk 's problem , they 've always cried to be treated like they 're special . 
  and now they love him . 
  i was just giving an example for the shake of argument . 
  damn , i 've hit some conservative nerve , huh ? 
  were did i talk about the immigrants ? 
  i was talking about who 's the biggest establishment supporter obviously . 
  and yes , establishment democrats are bad , but republicans are even worse . 
  it 's not like trump has picked * the * swamp for his cabinet or anything ... oh wait . 
  i 'm definitely not an eu fanatic . 
  i think union is better than strife , but i definitely do n't agree with a lot of shit the eu does . 
  like , are you kidding me ? 
  lots of them helped fuck the country i 'm living in . 
  it was against one system , or one part of it . 
  but it 's not against * the * system . 
  i agree a random billionaire supporting something does n't make it the system , but the question is why they would support it . 
  and the eu is n't in good hands right now , but it 's still better than the us . 
  and if the republicans - the american party that is 100 % with the billionaire establishment - like this , it 's definitely not against the system . 
  and they think they are fighting the system by voting leave . 
  boy did someone pull a wool over their eyes . 
  yes , the human body version . 
  what does tend to agree/disagree even mean ? 
  you either think they should have equal rights or not . 
  unless there were multiple questions and these are just amalgams . 
  we are getting there ... 
  wait for us spain !, 
  should be a mountain goat . 
  christianity did bring the dark ages , so i would say it totally did . 
  too bad they were corrupted by barbaric religions . 
  / s i 'm just tired of listening to this single term . 
  a bit of variety is nice , come on . 
  hellexit would be also a fun name for greece . 
  `` get the hellout of here ! '', 
  hardships in general do help with finding scapegoats to blame , so yeah , i would agree the economy helped . 
  better education would prevent it though . 
  as would separation of church and state . 
  unfortunately , the `` jews control the world '' mindset is rampant here . 
  the orthodox church does n't help , since they constantly remind religious nuts `` who killed jesus . '', 
  mind you , i do n't like what israel is doing , but i 'm not going to put every jewish person on the same bag as netanyahu . 
  holy shit , greece !, 
  i knew cypriots were xenophobic , but hot damn . 
  wtf did blacks ever do to us ? 
  wtf did asians do ? 
  and jews , ok , religious leaders are pretty nuts on that so i understand where it 's coming from at least . 
  poor cyprus and malta . 
  they 're left out . 
  does n't matter . 
  point was , only murica uses crappy measurement units . 
  except `` mile '' sounds cool , and i always was an advocate of changing its definition to 1000m anyway . 
  we 're in europe , dann it !, 
  it reminded me more of the town from beauty and the beast . 
  in honour of who ? 
  this might be the most badass looking human monument on this planet . 
  how do you beat gigantic swords planted in rock ? 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6lrxft/scumbags_of_europe_sir_charles_trevelyan_british/djw6hsr/ he tried to excuse it later . 
  so his excuse was n't laissez-faire but god . 
  still sounds like a scumbag . 
  that 's some heavy trolling . 
  so all that campaigning about voting may out was nonsense . 
  and is n't it gon na be worse when he has to deal with the brexit aftermath ? 
  european r/jokes , i like it . 
  what 's the timeline on this ? 
  cause the picture placement seems pretty random . 
  `` i do n't like sand '' - jesus christ . 
  they followed their more famous younger brother r/t _ d. 
  no , nevermind , the_donald is back online again . 
  damn , they 're like autistic kids that ca n't make up their mind . 
  i did n't mean it you guyz !, 
  yeah , i ca n't even tell who that guy on the portrait is . 
  op must have digged up some pretty obscure reference .
