catholicism is still important in spain , but somehow ( i do n't entirely understand why ) it seems to have very rapidly lost political influence . 
  i would say that in the 1980s , spain was somewhat like italy or greece : if the church ( catholic church in spain/italy , orthodox in greece ) said something about domestic politics , it was major news and could drive the whole debate . 
  they would n't always prevail in their view , but they carried a lot of weight , and any comment they made would be heavily debated by all sides . 
  a significant proportion of the voters would be influenced by it , and even moderate-left parties spent considerable effort to avoid antagonizing the church hierarchy . 
  since sometime in the late 1990s or early 2000s , this influence seems to have really weakened in spain . 
  many people are still serious about having a catholic faith , but the catholic church as an institution seems much less able to exert political influence on domestic spanish politics . 
  in italy and greece it 's still a huge deal when a high-ranking church official says something about a proposed law , but in spain the importance of their opinion on legislation seems to have been downgraded a few degrees . 
  at least that is my impression . 
  geez , how are we supposed to run an / r/europe when these germans wo n't follow the regulations !, 
  i also really liked chania the one time i went . 
  it has a nice old city that has n't been redeveloped ; you can very clearly see where the modern city ( multistory post-ww2 apartment buildings ) gives way to the old city . 
  the old city is compact and easily walkable . 
  and despite being touristy there is some very good food if you go * just * off the waterfront . 
  the waterfront places are n't ( mostly ) terrible , but if you go 1-3 blocks inland the quality : price ratio goes up a lot . 
  rethymno also has a picturesque old town , and a huge castle above it . 
  it 's true that much of the city is just '60s - '70s apartment blocks , but i think it can be quite interesting for visitors . 
  depending on what someone is looking for , some things to see : 1 . 
  since it was one of the most important byzantine cities , it has probably the best collection of byzantine architecture in modern greece , which is a [ unesco world heritage site ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paleochristian_and_byzantine_monuments_of_thessaloniki ) . 
  anyone can visit most of the churches when no service is taking place . 
  as you mentioned , there are some good museums , especially the byzantine one . 
  also * much * less crowded than athens museums ; often you have the place almost to yourself . 
  a few of the ottoman-era fortifications are in good condition and interesting to visit at least once . 
  two of them are the [ white tower ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_tower_of_thessaloniki ) on the waterfront ( symbol of the city ) and the [ trigonion/chain tower ] ( http://www.tripadvisor.com/attraction_review-g189473-d5534186-reviews-trigonion_chain_tower-thessaloniki_thessaloniki_region_central_macedonia.html ) on the upper walls . 
  the upper town ( ano poli ) escaped the 1917 fire , and also mostly escaped the post-ww2 redevelopment ( due to being inconvenient to get to at the time ) , so has picturesque narrow sloping streets , lined with 18th/19th-century houses , and cafes with views of the thermaic gulf . 
  on a clear day ( e.g. 
  after it rains ) you can see mt. 
  olympus fairly well across the gulf . 
  the [ ladadika district ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ladadika ) also has some nice old buildings . 
  used to be the late-night partying/red-light district , now still a party-ish district but has gone upmarket in recent years . 
  lots of very good food for fairly reasonable prices ( how the prices will seem depends on what country you 're coming from ) . 
  an unbroken pedestrian [ promenade ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/category:streets_in_thessaloniki#mediaviewer/file:thessaloniki_-_paralia_-_3.jpg ) along the entire waterfront , about 6-7km long in total . 
  not a serious one . 
  there are n't any separatist parties or real agitation for independence . 
  it 's more of a cultural feeling perhaps . 
  many greeks are traditionally loyal to their regions and distinguish themselves from others ( epirotes , macedonians , pontians , aegean islanders , etc. 
  all have quite different histories and traditions ) . 
  but cretans are regionally more distinct than most and somewhat more politically aware of having once been an independent country . 
  it comes up in conversation more in recent years , but i think more along the lines of a kind of cynical humor . 
  `` no , my friend , it 's the * greeks * who have gotten themselves into bankruptcy , not we cretans '' . 
  and some people do toy with the idea that maybe crete would be better off independent , especially economically . 
  traditionally it was not one of the wealthier parts of greece , but now it is less hard-hit , partly for the same reason . 
  its economy skipped the finance/business bubble of the '90s / 2000s that was concentrated in athens ( and to a lesser extent thessaloniki ) , so throughout that period it was poorer than the big mainland cities . 
  but as a result it also crashed less hard , since its economy rests on factors like agriculture and tourism that are somewhat less variable , and more oriented towards `` hard cash '' with less involvement of the financial sector . 
  it also has a smallish population , so lacks some big-city problems ( like the crime and homelessness in athens ) . 
  a few cities were somewhat modern , but most of tsarist russia just did n't have cities in the first place . 
  the majority of the population were serfs ( or after 1861 , quasi-serf peasants ) living on large agricultural estates . 
  i do n't know if golden dawn have , but he 's said that people from the right-wing have occasionally contacted him trying to convince him to put his name on an electoral list or join an effort to start a new party , that kind of thing . 
  i do n't know how serious they were about it , but it seems like some people on the right think just his father 's remaining fans are enough that he 'd pull some % without even doing anything , just by being on a party list . 
  but i think he 's pretty happy being off the radar . 
  has a good middle-class job , lives the life of a normal greek-american professional . 
  i 'm not sure about journalists . 
  i think as long as he does n't say anything political and stays in a pretty normal job in the usa , journalists ca n't make an interesting story out of it , and there are more interesting scandals . 
  obviously it would be a shitstorm if he showed up in athens and made a political speech , though . 
  citing a dane as your most-hated swede ?!, 
  now i 'm going to go revise my answer to name a turk ... 
  if ancient people count , [ ephialtes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ephialtes_of_trachis ) is used proverbially in greek somewhat like `` quisling '' is in norwegian . 
  but it 's long enough ago that i would guess not many people have an active hatred for him ( i hope not , anyway ) . 
  in modern times , the [ head ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/georgios_papadopoulos ) of the ' 67 - '74 dictatorship is probably the person for a large portion of the population . 
  though a significant minority thinks he was great ( it 'd be a bigger minority if his scheming in cyprus had n't been so disastrously unsuccessful ) . 
  weird happenstance : i know his son through a mutual coworker , who 's a nice guy . 
  the son was out of the country at the time of his father 's coup ( grad student in the usa ) , and decided maybe it was better to just stay in the usa , rather than get mixed up in a coup . 
  i did n't even know he was the son of the ex-dictator until i 'd known him for a while !, 
  felt a little weird , like finding out that your friend james franco is from * that * franco family . 
  ( the last name is very common , so you would n't know solely from the name , and he does n't go out of his way to tell people . ), 
  maybe it 's still too modern , but at least from what i read , i think of george wallace being cited in that role a lot , maybe even more than people from the civil war . 
  it seems like it 's more socially acceptable to admire actual confederates than to openly admire wallace ; even conservative southerners avoid his legacy . 
  also modern : commie spies , like alger hiss . 
  it was fairly similar in greece up until the 1980s , which was n't communist . 
  the first and third points are in common , though : people did n't move a lot , and rural people owned their property . 
  the other reasons are , i think : 1 . 
  nonexistence of an advanced financial system . 
  mortgages just were n't really a thing . 
  partly because of # 2 . 
  repeated devaluations of currency made owning property one of best investments . 
  even relatively poor people would try to save up to buy whatever property they could , instead of saving drachmas . 
  as a result people also culturally saw renting as `` wasting money '' : you could be putting that money towards buying property , but instead you 're just giving it to someone else !, 
  partly because of # 1 , development was often done with in-kind payments . 
  say you own a village home on the outskirts of athens . 
  as athens expands , it becomes worth it to tear down the home and build an apartment building . 
  a common arrangement is this : a developer offers to build it for a payment of some of the units . 
  he tears down your house and builds a 6-story , 12-unit apartment on the spot , and takes 4 or 5 units as payment for the construction costs . 
  your family now has 7 or 8 units , which lets you split them up among the kids , without the kids having to get a rent or get a mortgage . 
  this way high-rise development happens without selling land to developers who then rent it . 
  point # 3 took care of population expansion for a generation or so , but of course it only really works once . 
  in the next generation , you ca n't do the same trick by tearing down the 6-story building and building a 20-story one in its place ( partly because of height restrictions , partly because of cost and earthquake issues ) . 
  in some countries they laid some groundwork for it , but there were quite a lot of deists and outright anti-clerical people involved in the enlightenment , which i think is what really forced conservative christianity out of its stranglehold on european public morals , and pushed it to a secondary role where it has to adapt to public norms rather than set them . 
  france perhaps took the leading role there : the shocks produced by episodes like the french revolution ; the influence of deist , agnostic , and otherwise anti-clerical figures like voltaire & thomas paine ; the la\u00efcit\u00e9 movement ; the [ abolition of the church schools ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jules_ferry_laws ) ; etc. 
  that is also the model that atat\u00fcrk was strongly influenced by . 
  around here , the church has mostly been doing its best to keep us in the byzantine and/or ottoman eras , and extremely grudgingly moving forward only when change is imposed on it from the outside . 
  contributors to the [ modern greek enlightenment ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modern_greek_enlightenment ) frequently had anti-clerical instincts , and the church as an institution , along with its prominent officials , has rarely been progressive . 
  according to wikipedia , greece has 20 planes of the [ 2000eg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mirage_2000#mirage_2000eg_.28greece.29 ) , and 25 planes ( 15 new , 10 upgrades ) of the [ 2000-5 mk . 
  2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mirage_2000#mirage_2000-5_mark_2 ) . 
  seems like there are a billion mirage 2000 variants . 
  they 're mostly on par with european norms , i think , though i 'm not an expert in military equipment . 
  it 's mostly mirage 2000s and f-16s , which are what a lot of other european air forces use ( netherlands & denmark use f-16s exclusively , france uses mostly mirage 2000s ) . 
  hey we 've got the [ largest air force ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_of_the_european_union#combat_aircraft ) in europe !, 
  mostly f-16s ( 157 of them ) , plus some mirage 2000s , f-4s , and a-7s . 
  whether the greek air force is particularly good at using them , on the other hand , i do n't know , but they sure did spend a lot of money on nice equipment . 
  i could see that in principle , but it requires a good monarch . 
  greece 's monarchs have not had a good record providing stability or even good symbolic leadership .
