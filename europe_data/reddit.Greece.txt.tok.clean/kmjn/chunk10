  whereas the entire channel between lesbos and turkey is 10km , and eu patrols are n't allowed in the turkish half . 
  it might not be strictly impossible , but it 's difficult to do purely on the eu side . 
  it would be much easier if a joint solution were agreed with turkey , though . 
  that at least makes the referendum make more sense , since so far it has seemed completely baffling . 
  i think tsipras made this turnaround at the wrong time , though . 
  if he was going to capitulate , he should have done so at the end of june , and not held a referendum . 
  if he was going to hold a referendum to build public support for continuing an oppositional line to the troika proposals , then he should have continued that oppositional line . 
  holding the referendum , getting a mandate for continued opposition , and * then * capitulating makes no sense . 
  it sounds like he was initially on board with varoufakis 's plan and got cold feet at the last minute . 
  i can see the reasons for that , but in an integrated europe it seems like it may have negative effects on the banks ' capital position . 
  if the eu is telegraphing in advance that greek bank deposits may be seized in the event that this recently agreed program does n't work out well , would n't it be irrational of me to put my money in greek banks ? 
  it is getting easier and easier to open bank accounts in other countries nowadays , even for people with only modest savings ( not just rich people with swiss bank accounts ) , so i could simply deposit my money in a german or french bank . 
  not all banks allow people who reside in another country to open an account , but several accept accounts from residents of any eu country . 
  i think some greeks ( i wo n't hazard a guess whether a majority ) might even accept that * if * there were trust that it was a `` benevolent dictatorship '' , so to speak , aiming to reform greece into a prosperous country for the benefit of greeks . 
  but there is a lot of suspicion that the rule might not be so benevolent , and that an orgy of asset-stripping is more likely . 
  generally the problem with colonial type arrangements : the colonist often ca n't resist the temptation to govern in their own interests , rather than that of the colony . 
  i , personally , hope the offer to be swapped for puerto rico is still on the table . 
  i think at this point i actually would trust letting americans run the greek economy for 5 years , more than i would trust letting brussels do it . 
  as a sign of goodwill , greeks will commit to learning english and familiarizing ourselves with american culture . 
  also [ goody 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/goody%27s_%28restaurant%29 ) , which cloned a lot of the mcdonald 's business plan before mcdonald 's got around to expanding into greece . 
  same thing happened with starbucks , it ran into [ competition from mikel ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2014/09/07/starbucks-little-greek-problem-mikel/ ) . 
  hollande is apparently [ very opposed ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/12/trouble-brewing-german-plan-grexit-doorstep-rift-france-greece-eu-euro ) to the idea of a `` temporary '' or `` provisional '' exit ,  there is no provisional grexit . 
  there 's grexit or no grexit . 
  or to put it simply in french , there is greece in the eurozone or greece outside the eurozone . 
  as much as i think a well-written greek civil code would actually be a good idea , i have this suspicion that one thrown together by wednesday is n't going to meet the description `` well-written '' . 
  in greece i think this is n't necessarily the case , but perceptions vary . 
  the derogatory term `` gypsy '' tends to be applied only to very poor , semi-nomadic groups , and it would be offensive to call a person integrated into mainstream greek society by that term . 
  but integrated roma living in cities can still be seen as roma ( and/or identify as such ) . 
  a fairly large number of roma who are integrated into greek society see themselves as both greek and roma , for mainly cultural/linguistic reasons , because they are bilingual greek/romani speakers , retain roma folk music , etc. 
  there is even a roma neighborhood of athens , agia varvara , which is not exactly a wealthy neighborhood , but is fairly normal . 
  as far as i know ( i am not an expert ) , the greek roma population is quite different depending on which region and group of people , so it might depend on where in greece and what kind of community you visited . 
  there is a generally sympathetic article [ here ] ( http://www.domresearchcenter.com/journal/16/greece6.html ) you might find interesting , with more details . 
  the negative reputation comes mainly from very poor communities of nomadic or formerly nomadic people , who now live in tent villages or shantytowns on the edge of cities , are poorly integrated into greek society , and have a reputation for petty criminality . 
  why this group remains in that condition is disputed ; greeks tend to blame them , but that is probably not the whole story . 
  there are also a quite large number of roma who live in regular cities and are well integrated . 
  some may just consider themselves greek , especially if they are monolingual greek speakers ( common after a generation or two ) . 
  those who are integrated but also speak romani , and retain other aspects of roma culture , may consider themselves both greek and roma . 
  these people do suffer discrimination because of negative stereotypes about their ethnic background , but liberal-minded greeks should treat them well , and people increasingly realize that mistreating such a person is not correct . 
  i think the situation has improved somewhat for them over the past few decades . 
  nowadays for example it would be taboo in polite society to refer to such a person as a `` yiftos '' ( `` gypsy '' ) . 
  it has also gotten more taboo to question the greekness of people who are integrated into greek culture and self-identify as greek . 
  there is also a small group of roma with a nomadic lifestyle with an occupation of traveling merchant , colloquially called `` tsingani '' in greek . 
  they have an `` ok '' reputation . 
  they are seen as clearly different than greeks , with their own separate culture , but they have basically a respectable occupation , and this social group has been in greece for centuries , so is not seen as something particularly strange . 
  but this group is nowadays the smallest of the three i mentioned . 
  the reason for that particular legal problem is that argentina wrote bond contracts in which they agreed that any disputes would be handled in us courts , and explicitly waived their sovereign immunity to suit in the us . 
  they did this because due to a * previous * default , us investors would n't sell them bonds without that clause included . 
  if it had n't been for that , the investors would n't have been able to challenge the forced bond restructuring in american courts . 
  the greek situation would certainly be a mess in the eu , though . 
  there 's also a [ guardian article about this ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/08/greek-island-refugee-crisis-local-people-and-tourists-rally-round-migrants ) from a few days ago . 
  [ here 's his speech ] ( http://www.windhuk.diplo.de/vertretung/windhuk/en/03/commemorative__years__2004__2005/seite__speech__2004-08-14__bmz.html ) from that visit in 2004 , which does sound like it recognized it as such ,  a century ago , the oppressors -- blinded by colonialist fervour -- became agents of violence , discrimination , racism and annihilation in germany 's name . 
  the atrocities committed at that time would today be termed genocide -- and nowadays a general von trotha would be prosecuted and convicted . 
  we germans accept our historical and moral responsibility and the guilt incurred by germans at that time . 
  it 's also a near certainty that those who voted `` no '' today would still vote for the government on a formal confidence vote . 
  a government does n't have to have a majority of its caucus in the winning side of * every * vote as long as they can win formal confidence votes . 
  of course actual governance gets much more tricky if they ca n't count on a consistent governmental majority . 
  but it would at least theoretically be possible to remain in government while relying on the votes of the opposition to pass certain pieces of legislation . 
   i was surprised though by the fact that ministers vote - or that thet keep their mp seat while in government . 
  seems an unusual rule to not separate legislative and executive . 
  this is the case in just about every country with a parliamentary system . 
  for example both merkel and sch\u00e4uble have seats in the bundestag . 
  typically ministers are chosen from among mps of the governing parties . 
  in british political jargon those mps are known as `` frontbenchers '' and the mps without ministerial portfolios are `` backbenchers '' . 
  both groups participate in parliament and vote . 
  rates vary due to a variety of things , but not due to municipalities or regions having different rates , i do n't think . 
  the tax policy itself is national and applies everywhere . 
  there are different rates for commercial vs. residential property , for small vs. large residential properties , and for valuable vs. less-valuable properties . 
  for example , primary residences that are both smaller than 120 m ^ 2 and worth less than $ 150,000 pay a lower rate . 
  in the example you cite , are you sure that is n't because of the difference in value of the land ? 
  property tax is based on the property value , and you would expect land value to be much higher near nyc than in rural new york . 
   remove tax privileges of the islands ( crete , etc. ), 
  crete has never had the lower vat rate ; it applies to all the other islands except for crete . 
  since crete has a level of development comparable to the mainland , it was n't included in the original vat discount , which was intended to spur development of the islands . 
  in modern greek ypsilon is the same sound as iota and ita , similar to english `` ee '' as in `` tree '' . 
   i 'm somewhat concerned about how the greeks will react to an austerity package right after oxi , but realists will probably come to grips with the fact anything else would be worse . 
  i think it will pass , but i 'm more worried how people will react longer-term . 
  this agreement looks likely to result in continuing recession , possibly a worse recession than before , which is likely to produce political destabilization . 
  the centrist parties are already politically saddled with the 2010 and 2012 `` memoranda '' , and if syriza is now saddled with the 2015 memorandum , that leaves the far-right an opening to position themselves as the only credible anti-austerity force . 
  the campaign basically writes itself : vote for the patriotic front , the only one that has n't sold greece out to germans and international capitalists , etc. , etc. 
  golden dawn is probably too thuggish to win an election , but i could imagine a non-nazi far-right populist party doing very well if they get themselves together well enough to run on a platform like that . 
  i , for one , welcome our new yankee overlords . 
  minor correction : crete has always been in the regular `` mainland '' vat rate , despite geographically being an island . 
  i agree that moving the other more developed islands to the regular vat rate makes sense though . 
  the motivation for the discount is to benefit remote and less developed islands , which have suffered population declines and often have poor services . 
  mykonos is n't really in that category ... 
  [ according to tsakalotos ] ( http://www.european-left.org/positions/news-archive/euclid-tsakalotos-why-was-there-no-agreement-between-greek-government-and ) , they had agreed to a recessionary plan in late june , but they still differed considerably on how the impact would be allocated . 
  for example syriza wanted to get more of the extra revenue from improved tax collection on the rich and a new tax on businesses with over $ 500,000 profits , while the eu wanted it to come from a vat increase instead . 
  so i do n't think a recessionary plan was per-se off the table , but they disagreed on which kind of recessionary plan . 
  according to the bbc , the eu was amenable to finding some of the savings in armed-forces cuts , but the imf was n't , because the imf charter explicitly forbids including military cuts in restructuring packages . 
  i believe that 's a cold-war-era provision to avoid the imf getting mixed up in national-security issues ( though it is indirectly mixed up in them anyway ) . 
  it 's possible they will do some sleight of hand where the military-spending cuts count `` for the eu '' but not `` for the imf '' view of the restructuring package . 
  it was today , yes , vote on report a8-0209 / 2015 , `` harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society '' , and amendments to it . 
  the eu parliament [ votes website ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/plenary/en/votes.html ) does n't appear to have a roll-call vote yet , but it does list the vote totals . 
  the final report ( after amendments ) was passed 445-65-32 . 
  my guess is that the vote on freedom-of-panorama was one of the amendments , but i ca n't tell which one . 
  yeah , kammenos is kind of nuts . 
  unfortunately the former ruling party , the mainstream center-right new democracy ( nd ) , kind of normalized this kind of politics by allowing quite a few such people in their caucus . 
  he was mp for nd from 1992 to 2011/2012 , even though his views were crazy then too . 
  he was expelled from the parliamentary caucus in 2011 , and the party in 2012 , because he started voting against the government 's handling of the crisis , and that 's when he formed anel . 
  so many of his supporters just see him as just a legitimate center-right politician who split with nd over the austerity packages .
