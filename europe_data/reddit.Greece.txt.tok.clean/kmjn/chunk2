  for example during the ' 67 - '74 military dictatorship , the king took a wishy-washy position where he was n't strongly pro- or anti-junta . 
  which is why he ended up getting deposed . 
  twice , actually . 
  the junta called a referendum to abolish the monarchy in '73 because they no longer trusted him ( they had started out as officially royalists , to gain the support of conservative monarchists , sorta like franco did ) . 
  he lost that vote , in what * seem * to have been fair elections , despite being held under the dictatorship . 
  but after the dictatorship was overthrown , all its acts were declared null , so technically that should involve reinstating the king . 
  to see if that should happen , the new democratic government called another referendum in ' 74 , which the king * also * lost . 
  so he managed to get abolished twice , once under the junta and once under the democratic restoration , which shows how good a job he did trying to play both sides . 
  yeah , the former greek king 's house name ( gl\u00fccksburg ) is n't even easy to write in greek , since both hard ` g ' and ` b ' appear mostly in loanwords and do n't have letters in the alphabet to represent them . 
  and \u00fc does n't exist at all . 
  so the name gets transliterated to \u0393\u03ba\u03bb\u03cd\u03be\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03ba , which is something like gklyxmpourgk . 
  in greek we use `` russian salad '' for that for some reason . 
  thessaloniki [ has some like those ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thessaloniki_urban_transport_organization#mediaviewer/file:citaro_o530g.jpg ) too . 
  they do n't need to turn much because they run on the fairly straight major boulevards that cross the city lengthwise ( the red roads parallel to the waterfront [ on this map ] ( http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=14/40.6297/22.9449 ) ) . 
  i get along pretty well with the turks i 've met . 
  have quite a bit in common . 
  however it 's probably a bit of a self-selecting group , because i 've met turks mostly through universities abroad . 
  when we 're both in an english-speaking setting in a third country , chances are that we are more internationally oriented and secular than many of our countrymen are . 
  atat\u00fcrk is a complex subject . 
  first line is , `` i recognize you by the fearsome sharpness of your sword '' . 
  and it has 158 stanzas , takes [ about an hour to sing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aydiztnjrny ) . 
  what 's not to like ? 
  ( although technically only the first two stanzas of [ the poem ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hymn_to_liberty ) are considered the official anthem nowadays . 
  and i do like most of the poem , very much in the classic up-with-liberty/down-with-tyrants style of the turn of the 19th century , quite influenced by the style of french revolutionary poetry too . ), 
  they have a lot of more recent things as well . 
  turkey and russia supported opposite sides in the armenian-azerbaijan war of the 1990s , which produced a long falling out ( russia supported armenia , turkey supported azerbaijan ) . 
  partly as a result , russia officially recognized the armenian genocide , which antagonized turkey further . 
  yeah , it 's from july 9 , with surveys done probably in early july , maybe late june . 
  also there were some other questions ; this graph is a reformatting of the answers to only one of the questions [ from the full report ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/09/russias-global-image-negative-amid-crisis-in-ukraine/ ) . 
  it 's worth reading the rest of it to get a bigger picture . 
  i do n't know why this graph only mentions `` pew research center '' but does n't include an actual link ( i only found it because it was on / r/europe a few days ago ) . 
  yeah there are some strong historical connections revolving around asia minor . 
  i 'm pretty ambivalent on russia myself , but my grandfather was very positive about them for personal reasons , because a local russian official in pontus gave his family a russian passport in 1916 as [ events ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_genocide ) were getting nasty , which helped them make a safe escape ( turkish authorities typically would n't harm people who had passports of a great-power nation ) . 
  many greek and armenian refugees ended up coming out of the turmoil of the 1910s/20s seeing russia as the protector of asia minor christians . 
  and the orthodox christian connection helps as well , since people ( especially more religious or traditional ones ) feel a cultural connection even to current-day russians . 
  in recent years i think many greeks like putin just because he angers the americans , and a lot of greeks enjoy seeing the usa get poked in the eye . 
  but i do n't think there is much desire to expend any real political energy supporting him as he does crazier things . 
  that 's for views on russia , which are a bit more positive than views on putin . 
  the [ full report with both is here ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/09/russias-global-image-negative-amid-crisis-in-ukraine/ ) . 
  greece is less anti-putin than most european countries , but still net negative on him : 57 % of greeks have `` no confidence '' in putin doing the right thing for world affairs , 41 % have `` confidence '' ... at least as of 2 weeks ago . 
  the ottomans also aligned some of their interests with those of some fairly powerful greeks ; it was n't all via unwilling oppression ( despite what mythologized greek nationalist history says ) . 
  in the case of the patriarch , the ottoman interests and the interests of some orthodox clerics aligned in being anti-west : the ottomans were worried about another crusade being launched in the west to `` rescue '' the eastern christians , and were also worried about how to govern the greeks in a way that would n't result in constant rebellions . 
  hardline orthodox clerics had long been worried about pro-western trends in orthodoxy that they feared would end up with orthodoxy being subservient to the pope , and also wanted a larger role for the church in governing civil life . 
  so after taking constantinople , the sultan came up with an arrangement : find [ the most anti-western cleric ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gennadius_scholarius ) of the prominent ones , appoint him as patriarch , and delegate to the church responsibility for governing some aspects of the greek communities ( especially social and family life ) . 
  this , it was hoped , would both keep greeks from looking westward , and would also simplify civil administration , since the church 's authority was seen as likely to be followed , more than direct ottoman authority would have been . 
  the powerful role of the [ phanariotes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phanariotes ) , greek merchants and politicians based in constantinople who had a number of important roles in the empire , was another aspect of the delicate ottoman/greek accommodation . 
  [ ok , comment went longer than i thought , and is probably pretty off topic at this point . ], 
  you forgot sauerkraut !, 
  same here , but when we think of cia and coups , it is n't latin american ones that come to mind first ... 
  well they had to keep the accusations believable !, 
  nobody would believe that right sector are on board with * modern * european values ... 
  looks like no big change in sentiments in greece ( about 2/3 positive , 1/3 negative , same as before ) . 
  possible factors : anti-american sentiment , the orthodox-christian connection , and the increasing numbers of russian tourists . 
  from what i can tell they have a better relationship with nato than might be expected , because they 've shared information about islamic militants in the region with western intelligence agencies , which results in the eritrean government being treated leniently . 
  the eu is trying to half-deal with it , though . 
  the eu requires immigrants to be processed at their first eu country of entry , as if it 's a union . 
  without the eu , there would be no such requirement : if an immigrant entered italy and then went to austria , well they 'd not be italy 's problem anymore . 
  but under the eu rules they should be processed in italy as the entry point . 
  this makes some sense , if you treat the eu 's external borders as a quasi-national border , and the first entry point as something like entry into a new jurisdiction . 
  but then you have to actually treat it as such . 
  the eu does n't want to * really * treat the eu borders as the important borders in need of a common patrol and processing system . 
  but it does want the `` front-line '' countries to deal with it * as if * it were a front-line border , not only their own national borders . 
  this is a bit trying to have it both ways . 
  yes , i think the main concern other countries would have is the precedent if it 's a non-negotiated independence ( if it 's a referendum * with * spanish approval , that 's different ) . 
  countries who do n't actually care about catalonia do n't want russia to be able to use it as justification for south ossetia and similar , and china is very worried about such cases as well ( which is why they do n't recognize kosovo , not because they actually care about serbia ) . 
   also polish neo nazi in england ... 
  logical . 
  reminds me of the diaspora branches of golden dawn in north america and australia ... raising money from immigrant communities in other countries , to send back home to support an anti-immigrant party in the motherland . 
  unfortunately , you could have reprinted a very minor edit of this article , in just about every decade since the 1880s or so . 
  here 's a passage from wikipedia :  greece remained a very poor country throughout the 19th century . 
  the country lacked raw materials , infrastructure and capital . 
  agriculture was mostly at the subsistence level , and the only important export commodities were currants , raisins and tobacco . 
  some greeks grew rich as merchants and shipowners , and piraeus became a major port , but little of this wealth found its way to the greek peasantry . 
  greece remained hopelessly in debt to london finance houses . 
   by the 1890s greece was virtually bankrupt , and public insolvency was declared in 1893 . 
  poverty was rife in the rural areas and the islands , and was eased only by large-scale emigration to the united states . 
  there was little education in the rural areas . 
  nevertheless there was progress in building communications and infrastructure , and fine public buildings were erected in athens . 
  despite the bad financial situation , athens staged the revival of the olympic games in 1896 , which proved a great success . 
  the country has long had a problem of being a mostly poor country , with a wealthy merchant class whose wealth does n't really trickle down , and the wealthy class having quite a lot of connections with the political class . 
  disgust at the 100-years-ago version of that situation is one of several factors that converged to promote [ venizelos 's ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eleftherios_venizelos ) rise , where in 1909 -- 10 his populist appeal almost completely ejected the old oligarchs ' parties from parliament . 
  but that was obviously not the end of that story . 
  finally all these billions of dollars spent on f16s will pay off !, 
  the source of ` el ' is even more obvious if you look at the greek spelling of * hellenic republic * , \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1 , i.e. 
  trivia : why is the adjective spelled ` hellenic ' instead of ` ellenic ' in english ? 
  prepending an ` h ' is how latin represented the ancient greek [ rough breathing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rough_breathing ) mark on vowels . 
  therefore ancient greek \u1f19\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2 becomes latin * hellas * . 
  that probably really was once pronounced as something like an ` h ' before the vowel , but it stopped being pronounced about 2200 years ago , leaving * ellas * as the pronunciation . 
  nonetheless the rough-breathing mark , and its latin rendering as ` h ' , was retained in both greek and latin spelling until recently . 
  in greek it became just a silent vestigial mark , while in latin borrowings it was pronounced . 
  the greek spelling reform of 1982 finally removed those vestigial marks from greek orthography . 
  i do n't live in the u.s. anymore , but when i lived in houston , the poor people near me lived in housing that looked more [ like this ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/alvin,+tx/@29.416176,-95.239867,3a,75y,178.16h,79.52t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sl1dy3j8tjkpjzeyuppogha!2e0!4m2!3m1!1s0x86405ef64ba505df:0x5994eb37447891c9 ) or [ this ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@29.784314,-95.177185,3a,75y,199.19h,87.93t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1svgllqlwooupkoohzryv6uq!2e0?hl=en ) or [ this ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@29.779939,-95.341008,3a,75y,180.33h,79.15t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sjurynin4-fcw7kj4pddkqg!2e0?hl=en ) . 
  driving through those areas honestly did n't feel too first-world , even though the first of the three is actually considered more lower-middle-class housing , not ghetto ( the last two are pretty ghetto ) . 
  and if anything those are the `` nice '' kinds of poor-people housing , because they 're probably somewhat more hygienic than the ghetto apartment complexes . 
  not even just the projects , but also a good amount of the rental housing in areas considered ghettoes : most poor people do n't live in government-provided housing , but in rental housing in poor neighborhoods . 
  detroit gives a kind of worst-case example , but there are big parts of los angeles , houston , st. louis , chicago , cleveland , atlanta , birmingham , etc. , etc. 
  with tons of falling apart , vermin-infested apartments and houses , too . 
  there are also large trailer parks in many smaller towns and suburban areas with pretty poor-quality housing . 
  the * worst * housing i 've seen in the u.s. was actually in a non-city area , though , the mississippi delta region . 
  looks like shacks right out of the 1930s .
