  the only real thing that seems to be improving there is that [ the population is falling ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21579025-shocking-rate-depopulation-rural-south-scratching-living ) as people try to get out . 
  looks like the article has been edited to remove the word `` both '' :  however , if need be , czech fighter jets could be deployed in romania or other countries in the region . 
  my guess is it was poor wording , trying to say something like `` czech fighter jets could be deployed in romania , as well as other countries in the region '' , but swapped ` as well as ' for ` both ' and stuck it in a location that reads misleadingly in english . 
  interesting !, 
  i think in american english there is virtually no difference between `` how are you ? '', 
  and `` how 's it going ? '', 
  used as a greeting . 
  or even `` what 's up '' or `` how 're things '' . 
  just variants on `` greetings human , what is your status ? '', 
  greek is kind of in between : the common greeting \u03c4\u03b9 \u03ba\u03ac\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5 / \u03ba\u03ac\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 literally means `` what are you doing ? '', 
  but colloquially can mean either `` how are you ? '', 
  * or * `` how 's it going ? '' . 
  and you can choose to answer it in a way that grammatically implies either one of those questions . 
  for example , both `` i 'm good '' and `` it 's going fine '' are acceptable answers . 
  also a range of neutral-to-negative answers , like `` it 's going '' , and `` how would it go ? '', 
  plus some pun-style answers , such as `` whatever i can ! '', 
  that 's one that i think is similar between us/uk idioms . 
  americans are usually more direct , but there 's a particular class of expressions that mean something like , `` there is an outside possibility this is my mistake and i 'll admit that up front [ though i doubt it ] ... but unless you kindly point out why i 'm mistaken , i 'd like someone to explain wtf is going on '' . 
  one version of it is , `` so i might just be missing something here , but ... '', 
   i find it very hard to swallow that we should accept russian incursion in to crimea and ask the ukrainians to negotiate a settlement on that basis . 
  it 's very unjust . 
  this is what usually happens , though . 
  look at the eu 's approach to cyprus , and it 's basically the same : accept the turkish invasion and ask the cypriots to negotiate a settlement on that basis . 
  there was some tut-tutting for a few years after 1974 , but no serious sanctions or anything , and now the eu 's position is that the partition should be accepted as the status quo and a solution negotiated from that starting point . 
  of german origin , but he was n't himself from germany . 
  his father was from germany , but herman hollerith was born in buffalo , new york . 
  i wonder if the extent of recent emigration is part of it ? 
  there has been a lot of ongoing greek emigration , so many , many people have relatives in other countries . 
  it 's also been popular for greek students to go to other countries for university ( traditionally france or the uk ) , so even many people living in greece have spent 3 or 4 years abroad when younger , and some of those keep in contact with classmates who stayed there . 
  yeah , i believe that was around ww1 , mainly targeted at the german-american population , due to the xenophobia caused by the war . 
  at the time there were a lot of german schools in places [ like texas ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/texas_german ) which people suddenly found threatening . 
  looks like the biggest low-unemployment island is a sparsely populated rural area northeast of ja\u00e9n , somewhere around here : http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=38.299&amp;mlon=-2.988#map=7/38.462/-3.351, 
  this is true today , but it 's surprisingly recent that some of the swedish diaspora assimilated . 
  i have some swedish ancestry , and that side of the family spoke swedish almost exclusively up until the 1920s , and was bilingual up until the 1970s . 
  the first two generations ( emigrated ~ 1850 ) were exclusively swedish-speaking , living in a swedish-speaking farming town in the middle of kansas . 
  around the 1900s-1920s many people moved to urban areas . 
  that generation was generally bilingual , but still strongly congregated in the swedish community , in particular marrying only within the swedish lutheran church . 
  there was actually a big controversy in the 1920s at many swedish lutheran churches over whether it was acceptable to introduce english-language church services , for example . 
  my grandmother went to [ this one ] ( http://www.trinity-chelmsford.org/history/chrono.htm ) , which held its first english service in 1920 , over objections . 
  the generation born after world war ii , however , tended not to learn swedish , saw themselves as just `` americans '' , and was more likely to intermarry with other ethnic groups . 
  so , growing up , my grandmother spoke swedish with her older relatives , though it became increasingly disused after older relatives died , but she spoke english with younger people . 
  and my dad did n't speak any swedish . 
  nor do i , which is actually sort of inconvenient now , because i moved to copenhagen a few years ago . 
  greece : i would say generally positive . 
  diaspora is a greek word , after all , and has a fairly positive meaning going back to ancient greece , referring to greeks who went abroad as merchants or colonists . 
  and in general greeks have always had a large portion of the population outside the country ; in the 19th century , for example , the four big greek cultural centers were constantinople , thessaloniki , athens , and alexandria , and only one of those ( athens ) was within greece at the time . 
  large greek populations have in the past also been present in places like trieste , beirut , odessa , and vienna . 
  the main modern dynamic , which does lead to some tension , is that the diaspora is both larger and wealthier than the domestic population , at least if you count diaspora broadly . 
  if you count only people who still speak greek and have a reasonably close connection to greece , the diaspora is smaller than the domestic population , but still wealthier . 
  if someone abroad of greek descent does anything of note , it will be in the newspapers and people will be happy to point out that this was done by a greek . 
  especially in this case , there is no question whether the person is a `` real greek '' : if they 've done something famous , someone who is 1/8th greek of 3rd generation and speaks no greek is still a greek and their achievement is a greek one . 
  ;-) among less famous people , i would say people are still relatively open to ascribing `` greekness '' if the person speaks greek , though the connection gets weaker if they do n't . 
  if anything the opposite is a bigger sticking point : as a greek-american myself ( who speaks greek ) i find people are happy to call me greek but really do n't like it if i refer to myself as an american . 
  to many people this comes across as `` choosing '' america over greece , or even implying that america is better than greece . 
  if i refer to myself as a greek who was born in the usa , that 's fine , though . 
   i think that old world countries are unaccustomed to thinking of their societies in these terms . 
  ethnicity and where one is born still is still deeply-ingrained as a determining factor in how people regard one another i run into this difference in outlook occasionally from some of my more conservative greek relatives , but applied in reverse : not to deny greekness to immigrants , but to apply greekness to the diaspora more strongly than they themselves do . 
  i was born and raised in the u.s. to a greek family . 
  i generally consider myself `` american '' or `` greek-american '' , because i was born and raised in the usa . 
  but some people are almost offended if i call myself american , or use collective pronouns in a way that implies it . 
  they interpret it as if i 'm renouncing my greekness or ashamed of it or something . 
  but from a `` new world '' perspective , saying i 'm american is n't meant as an active choice , that i 'd rather be american than greek , but is just descriptive : i grew up in the usa , lived  25 years of my life there , etc. , so it seems accurate to describe myself as an american . 
  describing myself as a greek is also accurate in a sense ( and i do speak the language ) , but i 've never lived or worked in greece , so again from a `` new world '' perspective it seems stranger to claim i 'm greek . 
  in several relevant senses my knowledge of greece or what it 's like to live full-time in a greek culture is quite limited . 
  i ca n't say for other subreddits , but / r/greece is mostly greeks . 
  plus greek expats , and greek-american , greek-australian , and other 2nd-gen emigrants , and yeah , some tourists now and then . 
  but mostly it 's domestic . 
  not sure how that happened , but it seems to be a thing . 
  i think this differs a bit according to what part of the anglosphere you 're in . 
  in the us , `` better dead than red '' is seen as generic anti-communism , at worst associated with mccarthyism , but not really with the far-right . 
  some people might even associate it mainly with nixon and reagan and such . 
  but in the uk , it has more of a right-wing tinge . 
  the phrase is especially associated with the rock against communism ( `` rac '' ) music scene , which is a white-power music subculture that adopted anti-communist symbolism in an attempt to gain broader mainstream acceptance . 
   do n't say `` how are you '' when you dont give a shit it 's not * that * deep a question , though . 
  if you really want to know how someone is doing in a personal sense , you can ask explicitly , using a phrase like , `` so , how 's life lately ? '', 
  or `` have n't talked in a while ... how are things going with you ? '' . 
  if someone asks just `` how are you '' , or let 's say , '' \u03c4\u03b9 \u03ba\u03ac\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 ; '' , you could answer in more or less detail , depending on the situation and how you feel . 
  one possible answer is just the standard , '' \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac '' . 
  says a bit more , but still fairly nondescript . 
  and then more detailed answers are possible , if you wish to give them and the circumstances are appropriate . 
  as a foreigner in denmark who barely speaks any danish , this is my usual routine . 
  95 % + of the time i go shopping , nobody realizes i 'm not danish !, 
  i say very little , and so the truth is not revealed . 
  also , i have some idea what 's going on so i do n't do obviously stupid things like some of the tourists i see in front of me in line , which would give it away . 
  if the cashier says `` hej '' , i respond `` hej '' , which is easy enough to pronounce . 
  actually it 's close enough to english `` hi '' that if i * want * someone to realize i 'm not danish when they start a conversation , it 's prudent to answer `` hej '' with `` hello '' . 
  if you answer `` hej '' with `` hi '' , nobody will notice you did n't just say `` hej '' back . 
  then we silently stand as they ring up my groceries . 
  in some countries ( usa , southern europe , south america ) it might be weird to say literally * nothing * , especially if you had a lot of stuff , but it 's fine here . 
  we ignore each other , and the ringing up finishes . 
  then they say what i owe , which is a number in the crazy danish numbering system . 
  i actually do just about understand this system now , but it does n't matter anyway , because i can read it on the sign . 
  and i 'm just going to insert my card and enter my pin and pay whatever it says , even if i did n't have a sign to read . 
  i do so , and pay with a dankort . 
  now , the cashier asks me either , `` vil du have en kvittering ? '', 
  ( `` do you want a receipt ? 
  ( `` do you want to take the receipt with you ? '' ) . 
  i recognize this stock phrase by pattern matching two or so sounds . 
  that 's good , because i would not understand it even if my danish were better . 
  since this is said so many times a day by the cashier , they do n't really speak it as a phrase , but as a sentence condensed into one word .
