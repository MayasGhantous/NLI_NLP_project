  it is either the word `` v ` en ` k ` t ` ering '' or the word `` v ` bon ` med '' . 
  of course everyone knows what will be said here so it does n't matter that 80 % of syllables are left out . 
  i say `` nej , tak '' , pack everything into a bag , and i 'm on my way . 
  the only flaw in this perfect plan is if they ask something unexpected and i do n't notice . 
  then we have an exchange like this : * them : did you find everything ok ? 
  * me : nej , tak * them : [ * quizzical look * ], 
  there 's a little about that [ at wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mosque#non-muslims_in_mosques ) . 
  in general , mosques in the arabian peninsula and parts of north africa take a strict interpretation that prohibits non-muslims , while mosques in other parts of the world ( including turkey ) allow anyone to enter . 
  i agree there are more important practical problems to worry about , and it is indeed in turkey , but nonetheless i do think it 's a good principle for countries to be reasonably respectful of other groups ' cultural history , even that which now falls within another country 's territory . 
  i would apply this to greece as well . 
  for example if the greek government got the idea to bulldoze atat\u00fcrk 's birthplace in thessaloniki in order widen a road , or something of that kind , i would consider it a stupid provocation and understand why turks would be angry about it , even if it 's just an old building that is n't even particularly nice looking . 
  as an ex-salonikan that 's actually something i quite like about mayor boutaris , that he is willing to acknowledge that other ethnicities and nationalities have had an important history in thessaloniki ( jews , turks , armenians , etc. 
  ) , and that should be respected or even highlighted . 
  i think the same should be applied to istanbul , but of course i have less ability to influence that . 
  yeah , personally i think it was a good change as well . 
  how does it make sense to call a specific color `` skin-colored '' or `` flesh-colored '' when skin/flesh does n't have any standard color ? 
  you might as well label something `` fur '' colored or `` hair '' colored . 
  anyway , in the nordic countries the most common skin color is [ this one ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shades_of_white#ghost_white ) . 
  why albania in the first place ? 
  it seems unlikely that they are best equipped for this job , in terms of technical expertise and existing facilities . 
  russia itself has [ an extensive destruction program ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction#chemical_weapons ) and existing facilities . 
  why not move these weapons there ? 
  or is russia ruled out because the u.s. does n't trust them to receive and handle the weapons ? 
  yeah , i do n't think memory of weimar hyperinflation is a very good explanation for why german central bankers are inflation hawks . 
  imo it has more to do with the economic views of germany 's central bankers themselves , than with general observations about german history or the german people 's psychology . 
  the dominant strains of economic thought in germany have generally been inflation-hawkish , in earlier years mainly ordoliberalism , and in more recent years , neoclassical . 
  [ here 's an article on that ] ( http://ecfr.eu/content/entry/commentary_the_long_shadow_of_ordoliberalism ) . 
   of course , in the us we ask `` how are you ? '' as a type of greeting , and the response `` fine '' or `` well '' is somewhat of a formality . 
  this is confusing to many europeans i met . 
  when they ask the question , they sincerely mean it . 
  and the response is just as honest . 
  `` how are you ? '' to a lithuanian may prompt an honest ten-minute spiel about how shitty his day is going . 
  depends on the circumstances , but it 's actually quite common in the u.s. for people to give a real answer , too . 
  i 've had workers at coffee shops answer the question with a long rant about some rude customers who had come in earlier in the day , that kind of thing . 
  it 's kind of an open question : the person can choose to answer it with a `` fine '' or `` ok '' , or they can choose to answer it in more depth . 
  part of the cultural difference is that in much of europe , an employee would never give a detailed answer about how their day was , so the question would be taken as clearly insincere , since there is no possibility of answering it sincerely . 
  here in denmark , at least , it would be really strange if the guy at a grocery store checkout said more than a few words to you , unless you knew each other from somewhere else . 
  but in a trader joe 's in california , say , it 's pretty common for customers and the employees to have actual conversations while checking out . 
  something similar is common in a few european languages , mostly in southern europe . 
  for example two common greetings in greece are * ti kanis ? 
  * and * ti ginetai ? 
  * , roughly `` how 're you '' and `` what 's happening / how 's it going '' . 
  spanish has basically the same two , * \u00bf c\u00f3mo est\u00e1 ? 
  * and * \u00bf qu\u00e9 tal ? * . 
  the person then has a choice , depending on circumstances and inclination , between answering with a generic `` fine '' or `` eh , same as usual '' , or giving a more detailed answer . 
  the usual sources are the pre-invasion official censuses up to 1960 , which i believe are considered reliable . 
  wikipedia has a decent table summarizing them [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_cyprus#historical_population ) . 
  in 1960 , about 450,000 greek cypriots & 100,000 turkish cypriots , plus a few small minority populations ( armenians and maronites being the two main historical ones ) . 
  well , some of them are , but there is also a longer-established minority of turkish cypriots with their own culture and history . 
  they speak turkish cypriot ( a different dialect ) , and have an uncertain but seemingly distinctive ethnic origin . 
  the bigger impact of turkey 's occupation , besides the direct settlers , is imo a kind of homogenization , where for political reasons the turkish cypriot culture is denied in favor of `` regular '' turkish culture . 
  there have at times been efforts to do that with greek cypriots as well , also for political reasons ( by people wanting to stress pan-greek sentiment and suppress cypriot greek distinctiveness and language ) . 
  does this only apply to children of immigrants to germany ? 
  as far as i know , dual german-and-other citizenship is fairly common among german emigrants and their children . 
  i know quite a few german-americans who hold dual german and american citizenship : german by descent and american by birth or naturalization . 
  translations of a few youtube comments : * * when he says he looked into it , he means he googled `` free internet in all of greece in one year '' * * * it 's a misunderstanding , when he says `` wi-fi '' he means `` why \u03c6\u03ac\u03b5\u03b9 '' ( `` why eat '' ) . 
  but do n't be worried , he 's researched the subject . 
  in greece , at least , the communists are n't involved in this kind of violence ( at least , not since the civil war in the 1940s ) . 
  violence at the level of assassinations and bombings has been perpetrated by far-right groups on the one hand ( mainly golden dawn today , at various times junta-nostalgists ) , and anarchist groups on the other hand . 
  some of the anarchists are far-left ( revolutionary organization 17 november ) while others are anti-left individualist anarchists ( conspiracy of fire nuclei ) . 
  the communists ( main party is kke ) go for more the classic style of a disciplined party waiting for the revolution , and are actually controversial among the rest of the left for trying to `` internally police '' protest marches and exclude anyone `` undisciplined '' ( `` black bloc '' anarchists , molotov throwers , etc. ) . 
  the anarchists claim that this constitutes collaboration with the police , while kke argues that street violence is counterproductive . 
  no greek either !, 
   we do n't have `` ze \u00c4kzent '' like you do in america , i think you have the advantage that arnold schwarzenegger has set the accent bar very low . 
  if you are austrian and your english accent is less strong than arnold 's , then it is not seen as strong !, 
  apparently it 's a common surprise french people have . 
  they visit qu\u00e9bec expecting to find an outpost of france in north america , but what they actually find is french-speaking north americans . 
  looks like the [ long version is in / r/cyprus ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/cyprus/comments/1psrw4/cyprus_news_roundup_week_43/ ) . 
  greece also had a large role for the king at the time , though it was contested . 
  this era is called the [ national schism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_schism ) , a period of conflict between royalists and venizelists . 
  this is fairly common in both directions , i believe , and as far as i know there is not much remaining hostility to these kinds of visits ( although there are definitely hardline nationalists on both sides who might cause trouble ) . 
  the most common visit destinations for greeks who were formerly refugees from turkey are istanbul , trabzon/trapezounda , and religious sites like the patriarchate of constantinople , the [ sumela monastery ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sumela_monastery ) , etc. 
  evola 's writings * attempted to be * an influence on the italian fascist movement , which * rejected him * as a useless , romantic academic who could have no influence in the real world . 
  he , in turn , rejected joining the fascist party , and rejected the morals of the party 's members , who he considered to be lower-class , blackshirt plebs . 
  in short : evola and the fascists mutually considered each other to be idiotic losers . 
  but evola declared he was against fascism : he saw fascism as a mass movement that manifested a lower-class phenomenon , a rabble of uneducated blackshirts and brownshirts . 
  he does seem to have had a soft spot for mussolini himself , though not for mussolini 's movement . 
  as a greek , that this would even be a thing is ridiculous for several reasons : 1 . 
  the nazis occupied greece , quite brutally , and killed a large portion of the population through starvation . 
  these are your nationalist heroes ?!, 
  they did not only kill communists , in case that is someone 's reply : communist partisans mostly operated in the mountains , but those who starved from the nazi food requisition were mostly in athens , a stronghold of the collaborationist government . 
  the nazis simply prioritized requisition of food for their army above feeding the cities , so greek civilians starved . 
  nazis , both historically and at present , do not even really consider greeks to be proper aryans . 
  we are not nordic or white enough for nazi racial theory . 
  too `` olive-skinned '' , like southern italians or southern spaniards . 
  and there is too much suspicion that we may have interbred with turks or arabs , sullying the white race . 
  so perhaps this particular ideology should be left for the germanic peoples , and greeks should find another one . 
   nonetheless , i have some hope that the fact that they no longer look like winners will divert some young people from this path . 
  schwarzenegger did n't move to the u.s. until he was 21 , though , and was monolingual german-speaking until then . 
  i can read it ok . 
  i speak it better than i read/write though ( my mom is greek , but i was born/raised abroad ) . 
  hah , i realize , just looks funny . 
  a phonetic spelling occasionally used online is \u03c6\u03b1\u03ba \u03b3\u03b5\u03b1 . 
  that 's kind of funny to read in greek . 
  phonetically is something like , `` feek ieay '' . 
  technically the law is supposed to apply to any recognized religion , although eastern orthodoxy is singled out for special mention :  * one who publicly and maliciously and by any means blasphemes the greek orthodox church or any other religion tolerable in greece shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than two years . 
  * but it 'll be a cold day in hell before anyone is charged with blasphemy against islam , even though islam is a recognized religion . 
  if that were punished , several bishops would be in court ... 
  if we want dates for a * fully * constitutionalized monarchy in the modern sense , where the monarch is just head of state but exercises no governmental powers , i 'd put the uk somewhere in the 19th century , when the convention solidified that the king can not exercise his reserve powers on his own authority ( vs. on recommendation of the government ) . 
  i believe [ 1834 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/king_william_iv#later_life ) was the last time a british monarch imposed a prime minister on parliament against the will of the parliamentary majority : the king interfered to impose a tory prime minister , despite the whigs and their allies having a clear majority , because the majority was too radical for his tastes .
