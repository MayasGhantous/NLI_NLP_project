  it looks like some countries did n't report region-level data . 
  if you look at the footnote 1 , it say that data is broken down by [ nuts level 2 regions ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:nuts_2_regions_eu-27.svg ) for most countries , except for belgium , slovenia , norway , switzerland , and macedonia , for which only national-level data was available . 
  not a majority , but it 's the single most common origin , with about 15 % of americans reporting german ancestry ( next largest is 11 % irish ) . 
  [ here 's a map by county ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:census-2000-data-top-us-ancestries-by-county.svg ) showing the most common reported ancestry in each county . 
  the formal rules on transliteration can sometimes have interesting/silly effects . 
  my middle name in greek is * \u0399\u03ac\u03c3\u03c9\u03bd * ( * iason * ) . 
  in the u.s. , i chose ( well , my parents did ) to make this * jason * , because that 's the equivalent english name . 
  now i 'm doing some papers with a greek consulate , and they are complaining because my name in english and greek does n't match !, 
  since my u.s. passport says `` jason '' on it , they want to transliterate my english name * back * into greek as * \u03a4\u03b6\u03ad\u03b9\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd * ( * tzeison * ) , since that 's how you render an english ` jay ' sound according to the transliteration rules . 
  so my name makes a greek -  english -  greek roundtrip and ends up strange !, 
  a few somewhat old-fashioned ones , \u03c1\u03af\u03c7\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c0\u03cc\u03b4\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1 , `` it 's dropping chairlegs '' -- it 's raining heavily . 
  greek version of the english expression `` raining cats and dogs '' . 
  \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b5 \u03c6\u03ac\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bf \u03bb\u03cd\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 , `` may the wolf eat you '' -- a mild expression of irritation , possibly joking . 
  i mostly like this one because it seems like hoping someone gets eaten by a wolf would be a strong expression , but its connotation is incredibly mild , a grandma 's idea of a curse . 
  interesting shift . 
  since andreas papandreou 's administration , greece has traditionally leaned towards arab countries in its foreign policy in the region , and israel has for geopolitical reasons tended to support turkey as its main ally in the eastern mediterranean . 
  seems like there 's some reconfiguration going on in both of those relationships . 
   there is no safety net for those people . 
  i was surprised to find out that as part of the austerity package , greece even abolished universal health coverage , which seems insane . 
  now it 's american-style : you get health coverage if you 're employed , but if you 're unemployed , better not get sick . 
  i wonder how many cities have had their old city centers largely redeveloped in a small period of time ? 
  this one seems fairly extreme , but something not too much less happened in greece , but due to a population boom and market forces , rather than central planning . 
  nearly all the old city of thessaloniki and athens were torn down in about a 20 year period , ~ 1955-1975 , to make room for endless rows of 6-story concrete apartment buildings . 
  some parts remain , mostly by accident . 
  the upper city of thessaloniki was left alone because it was hard to get to and not considered valuable land at the time , and a few old houses have been preserved as [ museums ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atat%c3%bcrk_museum_%28thessaloniki%29 ) and similar . 
  there 's an alternate-history universe where the same might 've happened to nyc . 
  but the demolition of the [ old penn station ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pennsylvania_station_%28former_building%29 ) in 1963 plus plans to [ bulldoze a freeway through manhattan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lower_manhattan_expressway ) created enough opposition that a new [ urban preservation movement ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_york_city_landmarks_preservation_commission ) was started . 
  it would n't have been seen as a joke at the time ; the slang meaning of boner = erection is newer than the 1940s . 
  [ here 's an article about that ] ( http://www.comicvine.com/articles/off-my-mind-joker-pulls-a-boner/1100-142486/ ) , about an early 1950s batman comic that uses `` boner '' in a way that 's now funny , but in the 1950s would n't have seemed strange . 
  another one :  you can make just as many boners in their eyes . 
  sort of : the possibility to build a crematorium [ was legalized in 2006 ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/02/world/europe/02iht-greece.html?_r=0 ) at the national level , but so far [ none have been built ] ( http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_gb/features/setimes/features/2013/05/01/feature-03 ) . 
  in greece the church has actually run out of burial plots to sell . 
  now there is a complex process where you get a burial plot for a few years , then after the body decomposes the bones are dug up , put in a box , taken across town to an older cemetery where there 's a consolidated family grave , and then the box is put inside this grave . 
  so the family is burying/unburying/reburying the person for like 5 years after someone dies . 
  huge hassle , unnecessary dragged-out emotional process , and of course a fee at each stage of the process . 
  the government also gets some kind of b.s. 
  fees for `` health inspection '' at various stages . 
  strange complication is that people without cars have a problem just physically transporting the box with bones between cemeteries , because taxi drivers consider it bad luck to carry it . 
  the system of burying and reburying people while ferrying their bones across town obviously makes no sense , and i do n't think even the church would claim it was planned on purpose . 
  but is the confluence of trying to keep a traditional burial process while out of space for burials , and also refusing to change it to something else . 
  the mayor of thessaloniki is trying to introduce cremation as an option , but it 's not clear if that will go anywhere . 
  he actually traveled to bulgaria in 2007 to have his wife 's body cremated , as kind of a thumb in the church 's eye . 
  it is indeed true that nordic coffee is an acquired taste ... 
  i spent a while in greece this summer visiting relatives , and my impressions : thessaloniki , the 2nd-largest city ( ~ 1m people in the metropolitan area ) is also quite affected . 
  large parts of the commercial and industrial zones of the city are lifeless , since the businesses there have gone bankrupt . 
  the previously quite bad traffic ( the city has no metro system yet ) has noticeably thinned out , as fewer people have a job to commute to , and fewer people have money to pay for gas and car maintenance . 
  marginal restaurants/cafes have shut down since people go out less , mainly the smaller shops in residential neighborhoods ( the bigger ones on the waterfront and city center are still open , though business is down at many ) . 
  more people going out diy style , just going down to the waterfront , congregating around lefkos pyrgos , instead of going out to a shop that costs money . 
  big increase in bicycle use . 
  a smallish but noticeable number of homeless people , which used to be virtually unheard of in thessaloniki . 
  people are more worried about burglary and robberies , though i do n't know if the statistics corroborate those worries . 
  however the city does n't feel particularly * dangerous * overall , just emptier and palpably more economically depressed . 
  crete , on the other hand , felt pretty much normal . 
  business seemed to be doing well , no particularly visible increase in social problems , etc. 
  very laid-back , pleasant trip , seemed almost like a different country than thessaloniki . 
  it 's a fairly common association in the us , i would guess because of [ gay saunas ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gay_bathhouse ) being a famous part of the 1960s/70s counterculture . 
  i can imagine there could still be a monarchy if the old king had n't been so spectacularly bad at politics . 
  by attempting to play both sides and taking neither a strong pro-junta nor anti-junta stand , he basically looked stupid and neither side trusted him , and so nobody desired to keep him around as a statesman . 
  i believe abolishing the monarch was actually the only major act of the dictatorship to be upheld by the restored democratic government . 
  after the king annoyed the junta , they held a referendum to abolish the monarchy in 1973 , which voted 79 % -21 % against the monarchy . 
  when the restoration of democracy cancelled all junta laws , a new referendum on the monarchy was held , and the king lost that one too , though by a somewhat smaller margin , 69 % -31 % . 
  so he managed to get his crown abolished twice , once by the right-wing dictatorship , and a second time by the democratic government . 
   but i 'd guess finland and denmark , too i would say so for copenhagen , at least . 
  rental prices in copenhagen are hovering around $ 750/mo ( ~ 5000 dkk ) at the low end , and that gets you tiny , unrenovated flat , likely with a questionable bathroom ( e.g. 
  the style where the bathroom and the shower are the same thing ) . 
  nice renovated apartments near the center start at $ 1000 and head upwards from there . 
  to throw out some numbers , i have some relatives in thessaloniki ( 2nd-biggest city ) who 're renting out a 2-bd flat for $ 250/mo , about half of what it used to be . 
  crete would be an interesting option imo , if indeed he/she has savings and is n't trying to find a job to support the trip . 
  it has everything from villages to moderately sized cities ( chania , heraklion ) , is island-ish without being as isolated as some of the small islands , and it 's pretty easy to get by in as a foreigner , even with renting an apartment and that kind of thing , because people are used to foreigners . 
  and it 's a lot more laid-back and calm than athens at the moment . 
  in fact ( as the article notes ) that was one of the main original points of the concept : a french geographer came up with the map to argue to the french government that france was being bypassed by europe 's corridor of business/integration . 
  there 's snow , but it 's not that common . 
  some numbers i can find are that there 's snow on the ground 5 % of the time in nov/dec ( i.e. 
  about 1-2 days/month cumulative ) , and 15 % of the time in jan/feb ( 4-5 days/month ) . 
  though this past winter was snowier . 
  that is pretty interesting !, 
  as a greek , i have never heard our media mention this bit of information , but that is not a surprise ... 
  the jazz part is fairly well known in europe at least , i think . 
  the best-known jazz club in denmark is probably [ jazzhus montmartre ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jazzhus_montmartre ) . 
  it 's also fairly common to have french or vaguely french-influenced names for jazz clubs in the u.s. , but in that case it 's never clear whether the reference is to france , or to the new orleans cajun culture ( perhaps the ambiguity is deliberate ) . 
  i was woken up at 7am on a sunday morning just recently , by a group of drunken young danes walking down the streets in copenhagen , singing bruce springsteen 's `` born in the usa '' as loudly as they could manage . 
  the elevated [ `` cycle snake '' ] ( http://politiken.dk/ibyen/nyheder/gadeplan/ece1594066/koebenhavn-faar-235-meter-lang-cykelsti-i-foerstesals-hoejde/ ) bypassing the current mess at fisketorvet should improve that part of the city too . 
  currently it 's a major bike route but has * stairs * , multiple crosses with pedestrian traffic , and three narrow right-angle turns , which could be better ... 
  it feels a lot hotter when nothing is designed for it . 
  :( no air conditioning , and my office is close to being a greenhouse : the building is glass on all sides . 
  and only one small window near the top opens 1/3 of the way . 
  a plus side is that nearly every person in copenhagen is out in a public area having a bbq , or just sitting around talking with friends and drinking beer . 
  all the plazas , parks , etc. 
  are full of people day and night for the 10 annual days of summer . 
  hmm , greece loses its portions of epirus , macedonia , and thrace , but regains smyrna , halicarnassus , and pergamon . 
  sort of as if it had lost the 1913 balkan war but won the 1919 war with turkey , rather than the reverse . 
  i 've also seen it broken down into : dk/no , se , fi . 
  there 's even a [ scandinavia and the world ] ( http://satwcomic.com/product-pairing ) comic strip about that one . 
   it 's at least as bad as yanks thinking that entr\u00e9es means main course !, 
  in our defense , we at least spell * mayonnaise * correctly !, 
  ( but let us not discuss questions of pronunciation ... ), 
  i think some of it is inertia . 
  if denmark did n't already have a national healthcare system , i 'm 100 % certain that the current right-of-center parties would oppose one , especially the more business-oriented parties like venstre and the liberal alliance . 
  the only reason they do n't is that the system already exists and is popular , so it would be political suicide to propose that it should be privatized . 
  fwiw , the ottoman knife embedded in crete refers to the then-recent defeat of the [ cretan revolt ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cretan_revolt_\\ ( 1866 -- 1869 \\ ) ) .
