  some years earlier , there had been a big battle over civil marriage and family registration ( previously the church had responsibility for family law ) . 
  andreas papandreou passed that through during a left-wing government , and was attacked viciously by the right , who considered him an atheist hedonist undermining the greek orthodox national identity . 
  greek conservatives have made peace with some of these changes . 
  for example a center-right government is not going to try to abolish civil marriage , because it would be too disruptive and is now a fait accompli . 
  but most conservatives still support the idea of greece as a fundamentally christian orthodox country , where there is an important role for the national church in civic life . 
  the french enlightenment idea of la\u00efcit\u00e9 is still not really accepted by the more right-wing part of greek politics . 
  a big part of it is the iconoclastic impulse that has waned and waxed in abrahamic religions over the centuries , due to hardline interpretations of the 2nd commandment . 
  wahhabis are worried that people will venerate physical remnants of historical muslim sites in ways that constitute idolatry , so they want to destroy things like old mosques , sites , etc. 
  to prevent it . 
  though in the case of saudi arabia i would n't be surprised if some $ $ is mixed in to the calculations . 
  greek orthodoxy had centuries of controversy over that kind of thing during the byzantine era , with alternating periods of icon-painting and [ icon-smashing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/byzantine_iconoclasm ) , but ended up very much in favor of icons ( to the point of draping them in silver and gold and actually `` venerating '' them , but that 's another story ) . 
  the dutch also had some [ statue-smashing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beeldenstorm ) outbreaks in the 16th century . 
  i think some christian groups still have some version of those views , but they do n't have enough power anywhere for their viewpoints to really matter . 
  partly overwhelmed , but partly the system has never worked properly . 
  greece has very bad ( and corrupt ) bureaucracy in general , and it 's even worse for asylum applicants than it is for greeks . 
  even if you came years ago when volume was lower , and you had a very strong asylum case , your application would disappear into the black hole of bureaucracy for years . 
  and after all that wait * if * you get approved , there are no jobs in greece anyway . 
  so most refugees left for other eu countries , which have faster processing and more jobs . 
  that 's been happening for many years , but it was n't as big an issue until recently because the total numbers were smaller . 
  or if you prefer [ politics ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03239/angelatsipras_3239032b.jpg ), 
  there are arguments for either direction being the `` default '' , though . 
  one argument is to not allow the russian flights , because this would constitute supporting russia in its syria intervention , which the interim government does n't have a mandate to do . 
  but russia has been flying back and forth to syria regularly for a long time and has some legitimate reasons for doing so , because they have a [ leased naval base ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_naval_facility_in_tartus ) on the syrian coast ( dating to the soviet era , base for the soviet mediterranean fleet ) . 
  so another argument is that the interim government should let the flights continue as before , and wait for an elected government to determine if the situation has change in a way that would justify removing the permission . 
  since earlier this year , germany 's been accelerating the deportation of unsuccessful asylum seekers from the balkans . 
  there 's a new `` fast-track '' denial/deportation system for people from albania , serbia , kosovo , etc. , which represents a large proportion of total asylum seekers in germany ( # 1 country of origin is currently kosovo , syria # 2 ) . 
  i do n't think the majority viewpoint in greece is really negative on the refugees . 
  people understand well enough why they 're coming , and greeks have a long history of being refugees too , so there is some sympathy . 
  there is a vocal minority that is very against refugees , but i think they are only maybe 10-20 % . 
  there are many people trying to help also , especially on the islands , though in many cases they lack sufficient resources to help the number of people arriving . 
  there are a larger number of people who are unhappy about how things are being handled , but that has more to do with being angry that there is not a more organized government response , so everything is chaotic and causing problems for tourism and daily life . 
  depending on your political orientation , you might blame the greek government for this , the eu , or both . 
  edit : i should add that i mean specifically for syrian refugees . 
  greek opinion is probably more negative on others . 
  partly because with the news about the syrian war there 's more sympathy for why they 're fleeing . 
  and partly because there 's a long history of cultural ties between greeks and arabs , which is n't present with , for example , pakistanis or somalis . 
  turks were never the majority ethnicity in late-ottoman thessaloniki . 
  for most of its ottoman history the biggest ethnic group were the jews . 
  it was the main european center of sephardic jewish culture , called the `` jerusalem of the balkans '' . 
  in public commercial life , french was the most widely spoken language , since it was the * lingua franca * of the day . 
  for example in the 1890 census , the population was : jewish 45 % , turkish 20 % , greek 15 % , bulgarian 10 % , other 10 % . 
  wikipedia has some more on it [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/names_of_the_greeks#romans_.28.e1.bf.ac.cf.89.ce.bc.ce.b1.e1.bf.96.ce.bf.ce.b9.29 ) . 
  greeks self-identified as `` romaioi '' ( romans ) throughout the byzantine era , since it was the eastern roman empire . 
  eastern greeks in anatolia and pontus continued to use that term up until the 20th century . 
  everything in your post is simply false . 
  have you met any syrian refugees ? 
  i have met many . 
  they are not violent or trying to destroy civilization . 
  they are mostly pretty normal humans . 
  you sound like you 've been watching too many donald trump speeches ( or maybe le pen speeches ? ) . 
  in my opinion , the primary threat to european civilization are the far-right . 
  now * there * are people who openly hate european laws and refuse to submit to civilized authority , and are willing to use violence to do it . 
  i would * much * rather have a syrian as a neighbor than one of the violent , uncivilized brutes from golden dawn . 
  quite a few empires have been happy to accept civilians from any ethnic background , as long as they disarmed and did n't rebel against the empire 's authority . 
  alexander the great was fairly `` evangelical '' about bringing new peoples into his empire , saying :  i do not distinguish among men , as the narrow-minded do , both among greeks and barbarians . 
  i am not interested in the descendance of the citizens or their racial origins . 
  i classify them using one criterion : their virtue . 
  for me every virtuous foreigner is a greek and every evil greek worse than a barbarian . 
  the roman empire also accepted essentially anyone who was willing to submit to roman authority . 
  as did the ottomans and the austro-hungarians . 
  that 's one reason that during the height of the habsburg empire , vienna was extremely multiethnic . 
  if you showed up in vienna as a foreign army , that was one thing . 
  but if you showed up as a foreign civilian , e.g. 
  as a merchant , that was accepted . 
  hence there were not only austrians there , but also italians , greeks , armenians , turks , arabs , jews , russians , french , etc. 
  they are n't . 
  or at least , i do n't know of any country which allows it . 
  it 's up to each individual country 's law how to process asylum applications ( within the framework of treaties they 've signed ) , but i do not know of any schengen countries that allow asylum applications from abroad . 
  typically you must step foot on the country 's soil before applying for asylum . 
  i do think it would be more orderly if syria refugees were allowed to apply for asylum before reaching europe , but i do n't believe this is possible as the law currently stands . 
  instead the law says : first try to get to europe somehow , then apply for asylum . 
  unsurprisingly , that is therefore what people are doing . 
  yes , the distribution mostly looks like what you 'd expect : refugees are going to neighboring countries , and neighbors of the neighboring countries . 
  the only real exception is israel , which is taking very few refugees despite bordering syria . 
  the largest number of refugees are in turkey , lebanon , and jordan . 
  the majority are currently staying in those countries , but of those who move on , the most common next destinations are egypt and greece . 
  greece , at least , is currently completely unable to provide basic housing/necessities for the refugee population , mostly because the government is disorganized and near-bankrupt . 
  there are attempts , and on some of the islands local people are also providing charitable assistance . 
  but if i were a refugee , i would be looking for somewhere else to go myself . 
  heck , even if i were n't : hundreds of thousands of greeks have emigrated in the past few years . 
  you still have to live somehow even after escaping a war . 
  there is no real possibility of refugees living long-term in greece the way it is now . 
  there are no jobs , and no social support . 
  the best people can usually do is try to camp in public squares , in forests , wherever they can find space , and get food from charities . 
  but even people trying to help are overwhelmed at the moment and lack resources to do so , so it 's quite possible to starve to death in greece today . 
  like other southern-european countries , in greece the social-support system is mainly expected to be provided by families and extended families , and refugees do n't have any family network in greece which can help them with food and housing . 
  the government has tried to set up some camps but is not able to keep up . 
  so usually the best decision is to move somewhere where food/housing is available , either through state support or job opportunities . 
  ( another solution could be to improve the facilities in greece , but that takes money . ), 
  for a certain level of money , it might even be possible to find a location west of turkey ... 
  yes , i think quite a lot of the middle class who had stayed in syria , in comparatively safe places like the government-controlled neighborhoods of damascus , are now leaving too . 
  i work with a syrian emigrant who has a phd , and there is no major culture clash . 
  in addition to consolidating control over syriza , i think he 's also aiming to gain some votes from the center and center-right parties . 
  they are currently * de facto * supporting his government by voting in favor of the government 's proposals , but it would be less awkward for tsipras if he just had those seats in the government , instead of having to rely on nd/pasok/potami . 
  current polls suggest that a lot of centrist voters will switch their vote to tsipras 's new `` responsible '' version of syriza , so that might happen . 
  not really distinguishable apart from surnames . 
  my grandfather was [ pontian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pontic_greeks ) , but i do n't speak [ the language ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pontic_greek ) , and very few young people do . 
  yeah , [ this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ep9o9/zimbabwes_favourite_lion_cecil_killed_by_hunter/ ) . 
  there 's a dispute over the limits of greek sovereign airspace : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aegean_dispute#national_airspace ( see also the previous section about territorial waters ) . 
  the other reason they were voted out is not being any good at the job .
