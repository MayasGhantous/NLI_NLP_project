  they have no right to name their country macedonia !, 
  because i live in macedonia too!https : / / en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonia_ ( greece ) they can identify themselves as macedonias or slavmacedonians or albanianmacedonians ( 1/4 of the country are albanians ) , but they have no right to name their whole country just macedonia !, 
  according to this map https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/greater_macedonia.png/260px-greater_macedonia.png we have macedonians who speak bulgarian-slavic , macedonians who speak albanian and macedonians who speak greek !, 
  one nation ( the former yugoslav republic ) in exercising its right to self determination , can not diminish the equal right of another nation ( greece-macedonia ) to identify simply by its millennia old historical identity ( macedonia ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonians_ ( greeks ), 
  it was controversial among athenians !, 
  macedonians always identify themselves as greeks !, 
  strabo ( ancient geographer , philosopher , and historian ) said `` macedonia , of course , is a part of greece '', 
  demosthenes was a politician !, 
  why alexander the great for you is not greek but aristotle is greek ? 
  both were macedonians ! both were born in macedonia ( in greek macedonia ), 
  : ) thanks for you answer !!, 
  your opinion about greece?pros and cons, 
  i dont care either . . we have here macedonians who speak greek and in your country you are macedonians who speak slavic and some macedonians who speak albanian simple !, 
  macedonian minority in northern greece . 
  this controversial here its a political party who represent this `` minority '' in greece https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rainbow_ ( greece ) the macedonians in greece identify themselves as greeks !, 
  ( i dont mean the greeks refugees from turkey who live in macedonia ) my aunt is one of them , she is from a small vilage near - kozani if you know the macedonians have organizations in greece !,

  greece in english , iam fine with it hellas-hellada in greek, 
  in greece we call you gallia gallos for men gallida for women, 
  no way !, 
  yes is closer to asia than in europe !, 
  malta and cyprus are mediterranean islands !, 
  both are not part of asian , african or european continent !, 
  they have both european culture malta also have arabic influence ? 
  yes !, 
  but without turkish settlers !, 
  only with turkish cypriots !, 
  we treat the turks nice in our country and with respect!https : / / en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turks_of_western_thrace we live together peacefully in thrace so why not the same in cyprus ? 
  but if they dont want it , ok we will take only the greek part a referendum take place in cyprus for a union with greece in 1950 , 95 % vote for a union !, 
  yes but cyprus is a mediterranean island with no connection with asia continent !, 
  its the anthem for greeks not only for greece !, 
  really ? 
  in asia ? 
  why ? 
  why czechoslovakia split up ? 
  cyprus !!!!, 
  same language-writing system-culture-trditions same national anthem !!!, 
  greek-cypriots are greeks who have their own country, 
  the name is greek , chris kanakis !, 
  but he look like all americans in tv series, 
  we see uk just england with some autonomus areas when we think about uk we have in our minds just the english part, 
  the invasion in cyprus was legal . . the turk cypriots want their own country , what is wrong here ? 
  hostile invasion of nato in kosovo-serbia ? 
  reminds me our `` friend '' erdogan turkey does the same thing in greek waters or air space, 
  here read the official statement for the issue http://www.mfa.gr/en/fyrom-name-issue/, 
  if you want to know why we have a problem with them http://www.mfa.gr/en/fyrom-name-issue/, 
  yes ! but not every country built an identity based on greek , bulgarian and albanian history and culture . . 
  albanians here are immigrants !, 
  1/4 of fyrom are albanians , fyrom is a multi ethnic country !, 
  albanians are immigrants here !, 
  ( 4 % ) turks are 120.000 they have miniroty status ( 1,02 % ) and roma ( 1,8 % ) macedonians identify themselfs as greeks aromanians too !, 
  93 % of the citizens in greece , are greeks !, 
  in fyrom ... 64 % are slavs , 1/4 of the country are albanians and for the record fyrom regognize cosovo !, 
  the name macedonia do n't represent all the citizens of the country !, 
  33 % are albanians !, 
  the other countries they are free to name their regions as well just macedonia !,
