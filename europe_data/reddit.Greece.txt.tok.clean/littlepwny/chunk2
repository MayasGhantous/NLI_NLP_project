  do n't worry though , our prime minister did n't know this either . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.real.gr/filescalendar/2016/february/web-%ce%a0%ce%a1%ce%9f%ce%98%ce%95%ce%a3%ce%97.jpg ) is the latest poll . 
  an actual approval/policy rating poll has not been done for a while . 
  1st column is party , + - error , lower margin , central value , upper margin undetermined vote ( white/abstention/undecided ) is at 15.3 % which alludes to an inconclusive poll on top of the equivalency of greek polls and greek statistics . 
  the percentages with the undetermined vote integrated to the % is [ this ] ( http://www.real.gr/filescalendar/2016/february/web-%ce%95%ce%9a%ce%a4%ce%99%ce%9c%ce%97%ce%a3%ce%97.jpg ) the second question was the [ winner expectation ] ( http://www.real.gr/filescalendar/2016/february/web-%ce%a0%ce%91%ce%a1%ce%91%ce%a3%ce%a4%ce%91%ce%a3%ce%97%20%ce%9d%ce%99%ce%9a%ce%97%ce%a3.jpg ) which , other than the referendum , has traditionally been a very good measure of the winner in greece . 
  new democracy is at 41.1 % with syriza at 28.1 % . 
  other party , no party ( lol ) , i do n't know are the other options . 
   like the prior government that had everything under control actually , they did much better than syriza . 
  both in the economic and the immigration front . 
  the current government was complaining about the inhumane conditions of the refuge camp the previous government had formed which acted as a deterrent . 
  the first thing tsipras did was close it by the way . 
  now he is running around like a retard opening more and more camps . 
   perhaps this is a good time for macedonia to get back at greece ? 
  fyrom relies quite heavily on the greek economy , if they did not have austria 's support , i doubt they would close the border . 
  also , you should read up on the name dispute and see the greek viewpoint . 
   greece seems to have bad relations with its neighbors turkey and macedonia . 
  what does that tell us about greece ? 
  it tells us nothing about greece considering that the first is an imperialistic state that had occupied greece for ~ 400 year up until the revolution of 1821 , had constant military operations with greece ever since ( in 1996 the imia crisis almost escalated into war ) , and currently still occupies the northern part of our sister nation cyprus . 
  as for fyrom ( this is their official name in eu/un for the record ) , they are a young ** slavic ** nation that has decided to steal the greek history of the greek province they wish to be named after . 
  their `` macedonia '' is also a small part of the macedonian roman province . 
  at best , it tells us that greeks are very committed to defending the only thing they still have . 
  history . 
   and , yes i am ready to do this as it would save lives eventually , once the influx stops as there is no way you 'd make it north . 
  would your country also be willing to sign an agreement , along with the rest of the eu , that they will protect greece from any potential backlash from turkey or any international/european law or organization ? 
  or will austra jump to the `` wow , that is inhumane '' boat once greece has done the dirty job . 
   i 'm from slovenia and not germany ( i believe you thought so because of the my nick )  did n't even think about it . 
  just that most democratic countries would be completely shocked by greece doing something so drastic and , in my opinion , suicidal . 
  now , do not get me wrong , i have been against syriza 's pro-immigration/economic/piss-everyone-off policy from the very beginning but i would never condone such extreme and very illegal measures which would create an even bigger problem . 
  i would condone , however , measures that make it clear to these ** illegal ** immigrants that they can not enter any european country and do whatever they want . 
  only those that follow the proper channels should be given extra treatment . 
   macedonia why would one of the greek provinces have border control ? 
  gun them down then . 
  ok . will certainly be highly effective to stop the migrant flow but will most certainly `` reward '' us with a couple of justified embargoes ( from your country too btw ) from pretty much the entire world and violate pretty much every international treaty . 
  oh and turkey will have yet another excuse to press their `` claim '' on greek islands . 
   call every 18 + old men , give them a gun , send them on boarder and fight . 
  fight against what ? 
  lifeboats and sinking lifeboats ? 
  or what do you think about [ this ] ( http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2012-02-23/italy-libya-migrants/53220654/1 ) ; sending refuges back to turkey or their home country ( wherever the fuck that is ) is not an option . 
  i might have quite a few problems with my country but we are not a thug nation ... not yet anyway . 
  our ground borders with turkey , however , are actually heavily guarded . 
  you mean he drove his sister to the hospital ; whom died two days after while making pre and post voting statements about being in favour of the cohabitation agreement for same sex couples . 
  and syriza you mean ? 
  because of the united states and , i 'd like to think , the rest . 
  the us would not have been half as invested to intervene during the imia crisis had greece not been in nato . 
  well , we were on the brink of war in 1996 . 
  nato did n't mean shit back then ; why should it be any different now given that the constant violation ( from both sides that is ) keep going on and on . 
  as for myself , i do not have problem with turks and i have only good things to say about those that i have met ; however , i do not think that the violations , the situation in cyprus , and your oppressive leadership leaves any boundaries for a mutual friendship . 
  as a european citizen , i 'd say the same thing . 
  the stance changed because of the crisis in [ 1996 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imia/kardak ) . 
  on top of the cyprus issue and - less so - the constant violations , it is too much to ignore . 
  greek people are not hostile towards the turks in general but erdogan 's regime is quite questionable . 
  with another leadership , i 'm sure most greek people/politicians would change their tune very fast . 
  some people come up with really innovative ways to increase tourism in greece . 
   eu has more to lose by our department than we do . 
  / lol, 
  all those deals were arranged by nd government , tsipras only had to put the final signature . 
  just wait till ( if ) greece keeps the eight asylum seekers from turkey lol . 
  yeah but we get bonus points for being part of nato at the time !, 
  fun fact : us supported the greek military junta . 
  it 's already back in turkey . 
  the current greek government does n't give a shit . 
  they never did . 
  only if they come with lifeboats they are worthy of asylum . 
  ps : my personal stance is that i 'd want the eu as a whole to come forward in support of granting them asylum and possibly transferring them to hague to be judged or something . 
  yes . 
  now it will be infinitely worse if greece abides to the geneva convention . 
  my point was that nato means absolutely nothing when dealing with intra-alliance rivalries . 
  it still remains to be seen if it means anything with external threats . 
  that did not stop them in 1995 . 
  ( imia crisis ), 
  i 'd say it is closer to handing in your resignation , expecting to be payed until you actually land another job , and expecting a good reference letter while in the meantime you are trashing the company you work ( ed ) for . 
  no my friend , you will not be getting that reference letter . 
  and when your new employee calls , they will tell them exactly what happened . 
  it does n't even compare . 
  the eu is an alliance of nations not the ruler and a vassal state . 
  scotland technically ca n't even leave the uk without the approval of westminster . 
  she certainly has at least three reasons to stay in europe now . 
  they are called scotland , north ireland , and gibraltar . 
  the funny part is , even if greece/cyprus and anyone else did not veto , it would always be in the hands of the uk government to issue a veto themselves . 
  there was literally zero ways for turkey to join the eu without the explicit permission of the uk government . 
  i agree . 
  worst part was that half this subreddit was clapping at the `` time of democracy . '', 
  i agree . 
  52 % vs 48 % is simply too low of a difference . 
  for all we know , the actual % might have changed after everything or ( the retards that did n't vote because `` bremain will win np '' ) would vote . 
  in greece ( and i know its funny cause we did n't abide by the result ) with a 60 % / 40 % difference , there was little doubt what the greeks wanted . 
   good luck with turkey joining not while greece and cyprus still exist . 
  oh , i actually always thought it was alexander the great . 
  thank you . 
  hey !, 
  at least western turkey was ethnically and culturally greek at some point . 
  but nobody but extremists in greece would seriously claim western anatolia or constantinople . 
  he was born in [ pella ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/map_macedonia_336_bc-en.svg/992px-map_macedonia_336_bc-en.svg.png ) . 
  as you can see on the map , greece was not one country but a number of city states that did however consider themselves greeks ( hellenes ) . 
  the olympic games , for example , in which alexander the great competed , were open only to greeks and not barbarian ( that meant non-greek back them ) . 
  mostly [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_macedonia ) and their claim that alexander the great ( ancient macedonia in general ) was their kind of macedonian . 
  `` macedonia '' . 
  yeah , not with that name in the next two hundred years or until greece gets annexed brexit . 
  i agree with you . 
  anyway , the specific entry is [ sourced ] ( https://ejts.revues.org/4444 ) ( note that it is written by a greek guy ) .
