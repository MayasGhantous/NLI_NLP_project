we 'll need large amounts of guinness until then though , could you take care of this , * friend * ? 
  and no need to thank me , thank * you * for the interest . 
  i had no idea such was the case in armenia , armenian bro !, 
  you inspired me to read about it  people should realize that behind nationalism , there is always interest , and just stay away from it . 
  i wo n't go to a turk telling him to `` give me my land back '' . 
  it 's turkish land now , my life is here in greece , end of discussion . 
  we can avoid a lot of blood shedding if people start thinking this way , imo at least . 
  let 's just hope that reason will come with time . 
  there are no real macedonians , in the sense of there are no real spartans , or atheneans , or thessalians . 
  just like inhabitants of modern sparta , athens and thessaly , are those ethnologically connected to the populations of antiquity , same way the inhabitants of greek macedonia , are connected to the ancient ones . 
  why ? 
  well simply because the greek population of the regions never really left it those 2500 years . 
  the only rightful folk to make use of the name , are the greek macedonians . 
  in greece , it is very common to identify yourself from the region you 're from . 
  they just claim one part of our history . 
  if you asked an ancient spartan , he 'd tell you his spartan , not greek . 
  does that mean ancient sparta was something else other than a greek city-state ? 
  in antiquity , the greek tribes fought hard one another . 
  they were only unified against greatest threats , such as the persians . 
  ( the leader of the `` hellenic league '' , the federation that unified greeks against persians in 300 ~ bc , was phillip ii the macedon , just saying ... ) imagine it as if austrians suddenly started identifying themselves as bavarians , and wanted to claim the rest of german bavaria . 
  if they call themselves just `` macedonians '' , they will create confusion ( well , they do already ) , as in , actual ancestors of ancient macedonians . 
  slav macedonians is an already official and used term , which describes them perfectly . 
  african englishmen are also englishmen . 
  but they are not related to anglo-saxons , are they ? 
  they wo n't be related to them even if 2000 years pass . 
  not a bad thing obviously , just a fact . 
  same with slav macedonians . 
  it does n't really matter , ofc , but it does when this neighboring new-born nation threatens us out of nowhere . 
  it might be hard for you to believe that they really claim our land , i would be surprised hearing about such thing too . 
  but the propaganda created by their government is simply immense . 
  the slogan `` macedonia for the macedonians '' is way too common there . 
  just a peak : [ remember `` solun '' ? 
  ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wojcdrpfb4q/tkwp5oiqjti/aaaaaaaaafo/qlbyx_mpxmu/s1600/fyroms%2bpropaganda4.jpg ) [ notice the map again ... ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yqhcpaxy1sc/ucsgqdungzi/aaaaaaaaegc/ppsbub4hdq8/s1600/protest-pela.jpg ) [ you see the same map hanged in their classrooms ] ( http://www.historyofmacedonia.org/concisemacedonia/images/mk_karta_1913a.jpg ) [ same map ] ( http://www.lahana.org/blog/images/a4423a.jpg ) and there is always more ... 
  the `` sun of vergina '' that they use here is ancient macedonian ( a greek symbol ) . 
  vergina is a historical macedonian city , in central macedonia , greece . 
  absurdity at its finest . 
  they just believe they are the continuity of the ancient macedonians ... 
  but from ancient macedonians at 300 bc , to 1940 ~ when the slavic macedonians ( they were literally just common bulgarians then ) appeared and slowly started to promote propaganda , there is a. . . pretty huge gap , hahah . 
  i honestly have n't read much about how related moderns are to the ancient ones . 
  but they are the rightful people to call themselves frisians , if they are the only ones having at least some relation to them , are n't they ? 
  same way with greek macedonians . 
  nope , not to piss us off . 
  they believe philip ii was `` macedonian '' ( as in = theirs , not greek , nothing to do with us ... ) . 
  same with alexander the great ... 
  same with aristotle ... it 's tragic , really , but noone seems to care . 
  the government is completely out of control , they are dangerous . 
  i cringe whenever i pass through their country , they literally name everything either `` makedonija '' or `` aleksandar '' . 
  their ruthless government thinks it 's a better idea to spend millions bulding ancient greek-looking monuments all over the country , than invest in the peoples education or the countrys infrastructure ( you will go through two-lane roads from top to bottom of the country ) . 
  i remember the text that hits my inbox at the border , `` welcome to macedonia , the cradle of civilization '' . 
  makes me laugh every time . 
  what type of people linguistically ? 
  their language , which they call `` macedonian '' , is actually a bulgarian dialect , if that is what you 're asking . 
  funnily enough , they also use slavic names to refer to ancient macedonian cities ( such as thessaloniki - the actual , ancient name of the city - , calling it solun ) . 
  see , that 's exactly where most people get confused  only because it 's such an uncommon situation . 
  frisians of today are in fact the more direct group of people , to ancient frisians . 
  same way italians are the descendants of romans , iranians to persians , irish to celts , modern greeks to ancient greeks etc. 
  the core of the people in these regions remained the same for many centuries . 
  yes , obviously we were all subject to mixing . 
  but i am still closer to ancient greeks than , let 's say a german , same way swedes are closer to vikings than i am . 
  slavic populations on the other hand , arrived in the balkan peninsula on the 6th century ad , and they settled in the forms of [ sclaveni ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sclaveni ) , `` outside '' of the byzantine empires walls ( the region of macedonia was within those `` walls '' ) . 
  with time , the slavs were christianized and hellenized by the byzantines , mainly for political reasons . 
  no need for confusing details , the point is that during the byzantine times , there was no longer a `` macedonian nation '' . 
  just greek , byzantine , people , connected by common language and tradition , also affected by the roman culture , especially in matters of politics and state organization . 
  those living in macedonia at the time , were obviously closer to the ancient macedonians . 
  but most of them did n't really know , nor care ... 
  they were roman ( byzantine ) citizens and they could n't care less about the pagans of the past . 
  christianity changed the regional scenery dramatically , a new era was there . 
  it is really easy therefore to make the assumption that the slavs were `` too late '' to even interact with any actual macedonian population . 
  they did interact , and then `` mix in '' with the byzantines , but that 's it . 
  the actual problem is that the majority of the citizens of fyrom today are completely oblivious to these facts , they get taught a completely different , literally made-up history of their `` nation '' . 
  in my eyes therefore , it would n't feel `` right '' to call them macedonians . 
  slavic macedonians ? 
  sure , since they are slavs who live in the northern macedonian lands for centuries . 
  do you see the difference with the frisian example now ? 
  they are not related to the indigenous people of the region . 
  greeks on the other hand were always around , if someone is to inherit any name , it should be them ... ( and i really am not saying this because i 'm greek , again , i do n't give a shit about nations ) . 
  but , all that is just history . 
  speaking realistically , how on earth do you make 1 million people change their minds about their nationality now ? 
  i guess you do n't . 
  i honestly do n't know how this issue will ever be resolved . 
  i have dozens of friends from fyrom , actually . 
  in fact , one of them became one of my very close friends ( we went to college together ) . 
  so do n't take it personally . 
  i blame your government , and the fanatic sheep that stand by , it 's not a `` generalization '' . 
  should also be noted that you should n't be biased and expect all greeks to hate your country . 
  a vast part of the population could n't care less ( another greek posted here , tagging fyrom with `` ok '' relations ) . 
  plus , thousands of tourists from your country roam around the region during the summer , without any incidents . 
  it 's not the `` balkan hate '' that you 'd expect , we 're cooler than that . 
  i just do n't think the matter has to do just with `` politics '' , and tend to take it more seriously . 
  it 's a really sensitive subject , but i 'll do my best to explain it in the most simple and comprehensive way . 
  remember , nothing similar has ever happened in the history of humanity , so do n't try to compare it with other situations . 
  i wo n't go into details , and will base what i 'm going to say strictly on facts , history , not fiction . 
  ( so refrain your self from questioning/contradicting me before a quick googling ) . 
  what is going on basically , is that the population of fyrom , by being used and brainwashed by their extremely nationalistic government , are basically a living offense , but more importantly threat , to greeks and our country . 
  why ? 
  this ex-bulgarian , purely southern slavic population ( slavs came in the balkans the 6th century ) , today believes that they are the direct ancestors of ancient macedon . 
  as a result , they want to claim the ancient macedonian borders , the majority of which are within our modern borders . 
  such propaganda is being promoted by their government on a daily basis . 
  they teach in their school stuff like `` macedonian genocide '' and ousting of `` macedonian '' population from the greek part of macedonia , something that never happened . 
  it 's not just that it did n't happen , instead , prior to 1940 , there is no mention of a distinct `` macedonian '' nation , by any historian , ever .
