  syriza 's quotes contributed for sure but beyond that ... 
  he did a mistake : he said that he would resign if yes prevailed . 
  many people just did not want that to happen for reasons other than economic policy . 
  also some of his members claimed that banks would reopen a couple days after referendum ; i did not believe this but many people did . 
  it was not a classic lie , like the claim that he would get rid of austerity the next day after elections ( noone seriously believed this ) ; the claim that capital controls would end completely after just a few days was a lie ( that the opposition in greece did not counter adequately during the week prior to the referendum for unknown reasons ) . 
  so , if syriza said the truth , that capital controls would stay for months no matter what , and if the pm did not threaten to resign if yes prevails , these 2 things could very well lead to the opposite result . 
  i am under the impression that the total amount of ela was in excess of [ 105 bn ] ( http://www.macropolis.gr/?i=portal.en.the-agora.1974 ) ( last paragraph ) in the 2012 bank run . 
  if i am true , then why it was at 85 bn during the 2015 bank run ? 
  did collaterals lose so much of their value ? 
  i read that ecb did a `` haircut '' to collaterals but i never came across numbers , and besides the haircut was decided after the freezing of ela . 
  to me it smells like a political issue . 
  i read in a linguistics book that ju ( from jupiter in latin ) is related to zeus ( greek ) . 
  we say `` zeus did this '' but `` this belongs to dia '' , and in modern greek we simply say `` dias '' for all purposes . 
  elsewhere i had come across the info that z in ancient greek was often a derivative of \u03a3\u0394 . 
  so , it seems that zeus , jupiter and \u0398\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 have the same root ( \u0396\u03b5\u03c5\u03c2 literally meant \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 ) . 
  demon comes from ancient greek \u0394\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd which mainly means divinity ( \u03b4\u03b1\u03b9 seems to come from \u0394\u03af\u03b1 ) . 
  some of the above may be inaccurate , i would love to see whether i am wrong anywhere . 
  enough of indoeuropean , the greek word for saturnday seems to be of semetic origin , as one can easily conclude after comparing the maltese word . 
  slavs also use the same root . 
  i did not know that the root of all those indoeuropean words had the meaning `` to shine '' . 
  til as well . 
  yes , i know . 
  i did not mean to secretly print money . 
  as things are now , greece or any other ez country can not print its own just-in-case banknotes . 
  should this happen , it would have significant consequences . 
  i just think it should happen since day 1 , as a formality . 
  i mean , greece has army at the borders with bulgaria but the fact is not considered a threat for eu because this is how things have always been , but if there was no army there and suddenly greece or bulgaria moved army there and people took notice , it would have consequences . 
  haha , it is a routine that the us ambassador in greece ( yes , a damn ambassador ) yells at the prime minister . 
  chill out , in international relations the big country yells at the small country just like in kindergarden the big kid ( or the teacher ) yells at the small kid . 
  civilisation has not yet reached international relations ( or japanese professional environments i heard ) . 
  i agree that a social unrest is likely but democracy is at times very good at calming down people : it 's the government * we * voted for , why raise against it ? 
  if any given government feels it does not enjoy acceptance , it is a tradition in greece to go for elections . 
  problem is if in the said elections people vote for communists or , worse , nazis . 
  the plan , among others goals , intended to update the system in order to be easier to switch to a new currency if needed in the future . 
  which makes me wonder , should n't all the banking systems in the world , and particularly in ez , have a system ready just in case ? 
  and not only that , personally i would have some banknotes ready . 
  banknotes live for 10 years , if i make a bunch of banknotes but never use them it is like making some bombs but never use them ( bombs have expiry dates as well ) . 
  the cost should n't be prohibitive , while a 6-month period without any currency would be a disaster . 
  the state is supposed to be proactive , is n't it ? 
  which makes me wonder : did the previous governments have such plans ? 
  if no , then wtf ? 
  if yes then why did n't they mention them ? 
  why did they accuse the current government for doing so ? 
  why did n't they pass their plans over to the new government ? 
  in any case , vman is wrong for describing the plan to funds . 
  the information mentioned by this guy are * not * gon na reduce interests ( is n't this what he aimed , acting on behalf of the greek government long-term ? ), 
  because the existence of a plan calms them , but the apparent non-existence of a plan before , the uneagerness to pass the plan from government to government ( if the previous ones had one ) , the small team varoufakis made , and the ( he said so ) presence of troika inside his ministry , are very annoying info and the funds would rather be more anxious after listening to him . 
  i would never disclose so many details , i would simply smile with confidence and say `` we are the government , we are prepared for everything '' . 
  jews are generous too i heard . 
  they would offer good rewards to lawyers if they help them win cases . 
  they would cooperate with locals if they are to build industries , sharing profits . 
  however here in thessaloniki , houses m ^ 2 are mixed , so if you want a family appartment you should search for something above 100 m ^ 2 because they include the percentages of the common utility areas . 
  i once found a 98 m ^ 2 appartment and i measured it to be 65 m ^ 2 including walls . 
  i believe this was an idea of jews , who used to dominate in the city in the past . 
  and a joke about scots . 
  a scot father wants to chop some wood . 
  he tells his son to ask the neighbours for an axe . 
  the son comes back . 
  - they do n't have an axe . 
  - those cheapskates !, 
  go to our warehouse and bring our own . 
  you sound right , but this service became a global monopoly . 
  most of the people in it do it because else ... they are considered old-fashioned or otherwise weird . 
  it 's like electricity , if you are not in the grid you are ignored . 
  i do n't have fb , i did n't agree to the terms . 
  my wife has , with nick , her account is regularly deleted , very frustrating . 
  so i should wait a little more before i finally create my first fb account ? 
  because back in the day i took notice of this new trend , read the rules and * did not agree * . 
  if you type adonis georgiadis in google , some results are omitted because of the recent law that allows the right to forget . 
  guess who asked the removal of such results !, 
  it gets harder and harder to find his highlights . 
  he trolls , he is cynical , he is impatient , his voice is intolerable , he is always provocative . 
  he still works as a tele-book-seller , he likes to participate in all kinds of lifestyle shows and tv games . 
  he occasionally appears mildly drunk , he once was unable to do some very simple maths . 
  very smart and tough , has studied ancient greeks or something , but he is , uhm , mentally unstable . 
  when he was minister of maritime he passed a law that forced the fleet and the coast guard to use ... old greek language ( an artificial amalgam of medieval and modern greek used until 1984 ) . 
  his law was soon revoked of course . 
  other highlights include `` we do n't need troika , we can fire people on our own '' or something similar , `` if they ca n't live in greece why do n't they leave ? '', 
  referring to unemployed greeks , `` i told germans to close down their banks '' he said in german focus magazine ( they = greeks ... ) , and many more . 
  he has a constant production of controversial statements but he avoids utter nonsense such as `` democracy does n't work very well it seems '' . 
  as a book seller , though , he promoted nationalistic books , praised ancient greeks and accused barbarians . 
  too many hours in front of the camera naturally comes together with many awkward moments , you can imagine . 
  unfortunately i was unable to find a good sum or a video , someone else perhaps could add his 2c . 
  greece in order of popularity over the past 10 years or so . 
  - nea dimokratia ( new democracy ) : accepted in the european popular party , it is ** center-right ** . 
  was in power from 2004-2009 , and leading the governing coalition from 2012-2015 . 
  it never fell below the 2nd place in the past 40 years . 
  it has factions , during 2004-2009 it was more towards the center and more friendly to russia , while in previous times it was more friendly to usa . 
  after 2009 it became more germany-friendly because samaras , the new leader , changed the course ( he also turned the wheel way to the right ... ) . 
  it gladly absorbed members from laos and dimar ( see below ) while it is accused of having some relations with golden dawn and it certainly has absorbed members of the junta after 1974 . 
  - pasok is ** center-left ** , accepted in the european social-democrats party . 
  currently very weakened at around 5 % , it was the strongest party in the past 30 years , earning 44 % in 2009 elections . 
  it paid the bulk of the political cost of the crisis . 
  it has some factions , started as a populist left party in 1981 but since 1993 it became more serious , often accused of being more rightish than its rivals . 
  ruled from 1993-2004 non stop . 
  charged with a long list of scandals , relatively longer than its traditionally rival even if we consider that it ruled for a longer time . 
  they started as anti-usa but seems they turned pro-europe without deviations . 
  - kke ( communists ) . 
  they are hardcore communists , they follow a doctrine , do not allow deviations inside them , they enjoy at least 5 % constantly , their worst enemy is syriza . 
  they lover russia .
