  their agenda includes a non-negotiable exit from nato and eu , nationalisation of everything etc. 
  - syriza ( coalition of radical left ) is the currently ruling party , used to enjoy a 4 % constantly over the past 20 years , exploded to 17 % and then 27 % in 2012 , now 36 % . 
  it is ** left ** . 
  it has numerous factions , some of them pretty radical , others are more eager to discuss stuff . 
  together with kke they do not suffer from scandals . 
  after the recent signing of the 3rd bailout program a large part of it is going to split , something that will happen probably in autumn . 
  the splitting part is around 1/3 of its mps but i bet it will not enjoy more than perhaps 5 % in the next elections . 
  it is accused of being pro-russia , although its affiliations with usa are more probable . 
  it absorbed several pasok members . 
  the various factions have a multitude of stances , for instance there is a maoist faction , but democratic procedures inside it usually ensure that the most reasonable decisions are taken . 
  tsipras , its leader , appears to be irreplaceable . 
  it is accused of having affiliations with anarchists . 
  - golden dawn . 
  they are nazis , pretending to be merely a gang of nationalists . 
  traditionally at 0.5 % , they exploded to 7 % in 2012 and their popularity is currently at 12 % . 
  they were imprisoned after their immunity was revoked after being charged for forming a criminal organisation which commited murders and other felonies . 
  their worst enemy is anarchists . 
  - anel ( independent greeks ) formed after 2009 . 
  they are ** right ** . 
  they popped out of nea dimokratia , they are more towards the right , they seem to have strong bonds with russia . 
  they are accused for being too nationalistic . 
  they participate in the current government . 
  its leader , kammenos , was a minister during 2004-2009 nea dimokratia times . 
  - laos was slightly above 3 % . 
  it lost its power after it participated in the 2010 government and then some of its most prominent members departed for samaras ' nea dimokratia . 
  it is ** far right ** . 
  one of its `` traitors '' , adonis georgiadis , is perhaps the most ridiculous politician in europe , he trolls more easily than he breathes . 
  - dimar ( democratic left ) was a branch of syriza that broke off after 2009 and it also took parts of pasok . 
  it claimed it is * left * , it then claimed it is social-democrats , in the end it participated in the 2012 government and from 6 % its popularity now stands to 0.01 % . 
  it is virtually a dead party . 
  - potami ( river ) is a self-claimed to be center-left but it is plain * neoliberal * . 
  it formed recently and enjoys some 8 % popularity . 
  i tried to be objective and politically correct . 
  here come subjective additional views . 
  - nea dimokratia is a serious party but it has many non-serious members . 
  it is the party of the nomenclature , of the status kwo . 
  it seems to partially control dimar , potami and perhaps golden dawn . 
  its scandals are many but not as many as those of pasok . 
  despite claiming to be the serious party , it was during its times that greek economy went off-tracks , while even in 1990-1993 it failed to fix the problems accumulated by the previous pasok government ( debt , inflation , trade deficit ) . 
  it still controls the media in greece in the most disgusting way . 
  samaras is , uhm , not a true fan of democracy i 'd say . 
  it is ridiculous how , in 2004 , when it finally rose to power after 11 years , it followed a more leftish policy than its predecessor and it even did the unthinkable : hired a record high 800k public servants ( most were short-term though , clearly votes fishing ) . 
  - pasok is the king of scandals , with 2 of its former ministers in prison . 
  when it took power in 1981 it doubled the number of public servants and tripled the debt within 3 years lol . 
  it deflated violently in 2010 , its voters went mainly to syriza . 
  those 2 parties i hate them for being the corruption in greece but most of them pasok . 
  pasok tried to rapidly create its own nomenclature after 1981 but the new oligarchs , once established , usually had no reason to remain loyal to pasok : they would switch to nea dimokratia . 
  the stock market scandal after 1997 is perhaps the most ridiculous scandal in greece and i attribute it to pasok failing to control the prices ( the index rose from 800 to 7000 before falling to 1400 or so , many people lost their properties ) . 
  - syriza is accused of being not serious , you know , the usual arguments against the left . 
  however it seems to partially make its enemies true . 
  the economy derailed during its times ( granted , everyone wanted syriza to fail ) and the negotiations did not go well ( again , everyone wanted the negotiations to not go well ) . 
  it is experiencing a potentially fatal crisis right now , although i believe it will survive . 
  its leader appears to be ready to compromise but he also appears to hate corruption so much it 's unbelievable . 
  its complexity and democratic structure constitute its strongest points , with its leader being very loyal to the rules of the coalition . 
  however its propaganda wars were too one-dimensioned , with a prolonged omission of corruption and scandals ( now it has corruption and tax evasion at top priority , probably foreseeing that it will lose power before doing much else ) . 
  it is disgusting how all parties since 2009-10 concentrate all their hate against syriza . 
  perhaps this is why people chose it : if all powers accuse it , then it must be good !, 
  it does have some utterly ridiculous members , but who does n't ? 
  - potami is promoted by eu and the media , is friends with nea dimokratia and looks like it would be more than happy to apply neoliberal policies even harsher than the present ones . 
  there are family relationships between prominent members of potami , dimar and nea dimokratia . 
  - anel are accused of being non-serious . 
  they seem to endorse conspiracy theories . 
  its leader is a dirty person according to personal information ( the former leader of pasok is also a dirty person according to personal information , but he seems to at least have some limits and he is damn smart ) . 
  both pasok and nea dimokratia can not , due to dependencies , fight cartels , corruption and tax evasion . 
  syriza used to propagandise in favor of immigrants , but now it has to see the true dimensions of the problem . 
  nea dimokratia has a very peculiar stance towards immigrants and it has switched abruptly in the past 25 years . 
  golden dawn really hates immigrants . 
  only potami , a couple minor parties , including a weird one which enjoys a spectacular popularity in the most wealthy neighborhoods of athens and promotes the creation of ... labor camps , and a faction of nea dimocratia are unquestionably in favor of austerity ( liberal ) . 
  this faction of nea dimocratia is likely to produce the next leader of the party soon . 
  it does not include reserves . 
  25 years ago when the first gulf war was initiated , my father tried to explain me why he supported us and nato attacks . 
  he said `` if those arabs unite , we are in deep trouble '' . 
  now with the isis i finally got an idea of what he said back then . 
  i do n't know exactly who has something to earn from the formation of isis , but its formation used the notion of united arabs in order to gain some support ( the hordes of immigrants profe that they do not enjoy that much support though ) . 
  keep in mind though that despite such immunity the number of mps in greece who went to trial and even were convicted and imprisoned increased during the crisis . 
  even andreas papandreou , then ex pm , was put into trial some 25 years ago ( he was narrowly held innocent ) . 
  the most recent cases include the whole of golden dawn party ( the nazis ) , and the cases of former ministers tsochatzopoulos and papakonstantinou . 
  in the past , whenever a politician was elected anywhere in greece , hordes of lawsuits would align behind him for the sole reason of obstructing his job . 
  no matter how good you are , you have enough enemies to flood you with lawsuits . 
  legislation had to be made so that while a politician is a minister or a member of parliament all lawsuits against him are postponed except from the most serious ones . 
  so , if you want to flood him , you will have to wait for him to cease being a member of the parliament , so you will effectively not hinder his work and thus you have no reason to pay money for a lawsuit that may never have the slightest effect . 
  seriously , in the past when there was no such law , mps and ministers would spend more than half their time in court rooms . 
  this is obstruction of governance . 
   so it 's probable that he offers the varoufakis ' head in exchange for their support . 
  this is impossible . 
  if the country is dragged into elections or something before the end of august , then greece will be very likely to miss the train of europe . 
  the 20 august agreement has to be signed , and then a few laws have to pass , some money to be released , and only then we can have elections . 
  elections in september are not going to happen again in greece after the 2007 wildfires , so late october - early november is a good idea ( in order to save as much of tourism as possible ) . 
  the opposition is supporting the plan because if it does not then bye bye euro . 
  the government tolerates the support of the hostile opposition for the same reason . 
  in the mean time they dig one the grave of the other , but the mutual support is offered without prerequirements . 
  fyi , and perhaps irrelevant , varoufakis had stated once that now that he was appointed as minister he would have to stop posting at his blog , * promising that once his time is over he will return with ** juicy ** details from inside * . 
  this is a very worrying statement that unfortunately came true . 
  i would not have trusted him . 
  preparatory actions that ease a subsequent coup or treason plot constitute a crime on their own . 
  the key here is whether his actions were easing a treason plot or they were firefighting precautions for the worst case scenario . 
  any sane citizen would expect his government to be prepared for worst case scenaria . 
  the fact that varoufakis did something towards this direction while his political opponents apparently did not while they were in charge is politically very relevant and hot because the former governments have to defend their ( apparent ) choice of leaving greek banking system unfortified and unable to deal with capital controls , lack of liquidity or even monetary switch , so instead of purely defending they found an opportunity to counter attack . 
  that said , i am not in position to rule out the possibility that there was indeed a treason plot . 
  how would i know ?
