it 's not simplistic , it 's just plain wrong . 
  killers , professional killers , does n't make a difference . 
  the defense rests . 
  i did n't start this discussion - my end-game is not relevant . 
  the argument is n't that people are getting poorer - they 're probably not but that 's just my hunch , it 's the gap is widening and is therefore more difficult to surmount , leading to more inequality , and so forth . 
   this is the exception to the rule , if the story is even true . 
   how would you even know . 
  ] , madrid new highways , barcelona 's forum , valencia 's street f1 circuit , and the myriad of other infrastructure investments that we have burned billions and billions of euros in and now sit abandoned/unused . 
   i know of at least one more country where such infrastructure is sitting abandoned . 
  take a guess which . 
  worse , people who read marx and do n't understand a word of what he writes , but use him anyway . 
  think of two points moving along the same line , but at different rates ( speeds ) . 
  now think of the difference in rates increasing . 
  this is the wealth gap . 
  if so , then why is this in the news ? 
  that 's a different topic . 
  maybe you want to change it again in the next comment of yours . 
  discrimination is discrimination is discrimination . 
   leaving them in italy in greece is not really viable option . 
  / u/this _ toe_shall_pass points out why this _ is _ viable , but you are too busy dismissing him/her . 
  it 's interesting that you think you 're anti-things , where _ things _ includes nazism , the theory of which was itself kind of anti-things which overlap with your things . 
  yes , it does . 
  it 's one of the reasons one may be opposed to immigration . 
  i lasted 6 months , on and off , then i decided i did n't want to hate myself any more . 
  are you by any chance clayton bigsby ? 
  now now , i think we can all agree all of manchester is equally shit . 
  i like how everyone 's given them _ enough _ space . 
  not necessarily , but as it can lead to unwanted friction , it will be denied by the gr side . 
  this is especially likely given that anel founder kammenos is in mod office . 
   but i do not see them not jumping for the opportunity to `` help '' with patrolling greek waters only to deny leaving / laying a claim to them as soon as the first turkish ship arrives on scene . 
  i have no idea what you mean by this . 
  good . 
  about time for more of her kind to stand before justice . 
  turkey is already providing aid by aiding refugees and controlling their own border . 
  from the greek point of view , that is splendid cooperative behaviour . 
  twice a day !, 
   simply ferry the migrants straight from lesbos back to turkey i 'm so glad you 're able to reduce the complex diplomatic relationship of greece and turkey into ten simple words . 
  i say it here , it comes out there . 
  right , they 're everyday bystanders . 
  we know of _ their _ political responsibilities , huh ? 
  thanks for honouring me with your dumb argument . 
  let 's call all neo-nazis _ right-wingers _ and further dilute the meaning of words until they mean nothing , maybe then you 'll have something meaningful to contribute . 
  even though i see nothing wrong with money-grabbing , 15 % is very generous . 
  the story is going to be bigger than twilight , for sure !, 
  why are you continuing to put words in my mouth ? 
  i did n't comment on other parties ( and i 'm sure they 're as shit as you say because let 's face it , they probably are ) , or previous governments , so do n't bring them in . 
  more speculation . 
  more populism . 
  i do n't vote in greece any longer , so i 'm not at all invested in listening to ( or reading ) their nonsense . 
  i stand by the fact they do n't list a concrete plan . 
  it 's not surprising that you buy into them , when nobody in gr actually knows what a plan even looks like . 
  i do n't see a plan , i see a bunch of proposals without a common goal or even implied benefits . 
  some of them are simply insane ( `` reduction by 20 % of all public and private sector salaries '' ) , and some just apply to popular appeal ( `` 50 % reduction of the salaries of all elected and appointed officials '' ) ... no , i 'm sorry , i 'll just stop commenting here . 
  they have _ no _ plan . 
  competition , how does it work ? 
  i believe in logic , and reason . 
  that you would go into the process of inventing a possible scenario in which isil follows ex-fsa people into greece in order to exert revenge is so ludicrous , it might make for some good hunger games fanfic . 
  i believe it would do well in today 's market . 
  my offer for 15 % royalties still stands . 
  accept or stay away from my warm , warm $ . 
  your scenario is getting more convoluted , and thus improbable , with every comment . 
  let 's continue , it may be the start of a good story . 
  i 'll write the book , you get 15 % of all royalties . 
  people in here seem to think you can contain people in a country , like a jail , on force of will alone . 
  where the camps are going to be built , who 's going to receive the refugees , if the military 's getting deployed , if there 'll be penalties for those that do n't participate - i do n't care about any of that . 
  what i want , what 's important to me , is that we treat them like people and uphold their rights as humans . 
  why would isil follow refugees ? 
  it 's a two , maybe three , day event . 
  why _ would n't _ it get a megathread ? 
  the symbol may have had another meaning 2000 years ago , now it 's appropriated by a neo-nazi gang . 
  they 're not right wingers . 
  they 're a neo-nazi gang . 
  do n't be pc about this fact . 
  university of macedonia does some very well organised & informative polls , people should check them out . 
  most of the time they 're right on target , too . 
   left-wing establishment just think before you write something down . 
  i 'm tempted to say that 's right - people do n't seem to get tired of whining . 
  i for one have already stopped addressing the `` european value lovers '' . 
   44 % abstention , must be a new record . 
  it is . 
  largest since 1975 . 
  they are completely out of the parliament , as expected . 
  cry wolf long enough , you 're bound to be right sometime . 
  he 's not some modern day prophet , he saw past the bullshit and guess what , there are lots of people that did . 
  leventis is still ridiculous in the actions his party 's proposing . 
  greek surnames are n't categorised ( to the best of my knowledge ) according to their suffix , because suffixes are encountered across categories and only sometimes are used to denote a common property , such as : - - \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 & - \u03b1\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2 : son or descendant of - - \u03b1\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2 or - \u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 : also denoting occupation , as in \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2 as such , the origin of a greek surname ( whether it 's occupational , or topographical , etc ) is almost always in the affix . 
  a farmer , possibly ? 
  ah , there we have it : http://www.ancestry.com/name-origin?surname=dvorak, 
  married men can become priests , but ( orthodox ) priests ca n't marry . 
  lots of good info , cheers, 
  the claim is outlandish anyway . 
  oh you 're one of those . 
   many of them ca n't even learn our language because do n't know the latin alphabet . 
  is not supported by reality , as demonstrated . 
   they are basically illiterate . 
  they 're actually 80 % literate according to wikipedia 's sources , which is fascinatingly good coverage for a country torn by war for so long . 
   and there is no work here for people without sufficient language skills , proper degrees and professional training . 
  depending on where `` here '' is , there 's various ranges of capacity for unskilled workers in eu , from `` big '' to `` please send us anyone who can carry a stick '' . 
  last but certainly not least ,  you were n't aware of the latin alphabet when you were 30 and looking for a job in germany ? 
  no you were n't .
