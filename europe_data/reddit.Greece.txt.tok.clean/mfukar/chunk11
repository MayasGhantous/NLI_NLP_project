  as long as his interests are aligned , sure . 
  he has n't been very cooperative in his statements since ~ january ( as far as i can recall right now ) , though . 
  which is particularly interesting , because the finn economy is at a very critical junction right now . 
  contrast his interview with reuters with the one from [ wsj ] ( http://blogs.wsj.com/brussels/2015/08/14/finlands-stubb-on-greece-ive-never-seen-risks-like-that-in-negotiations/ ) yesterday . 
  i 'm trying hard not to call him two-faced ( ah , i failed ) . 
  `` show me your tits , and i will judge'em '' judgement ? 
  he 's not trying very hard if he did n't succeed during his office . 
  you obviously have an axe to grind , and did n't even realise what i 'm talking about . 
  so in the interest of saving us both time , i 'll stop here . 
   first of all , they should n't even be here , because they went to safe countries before , where they should have stayed . 
  yeah , you could 've stopped there , that 's all the proof anybody needs , really . 
  [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/3gy6rg/dutch_newspaper_uses_nword_in_headline_of_review/cu2kico ) captures my feelings pretty well . 
  enough with political correctness . 
  no , i meant it 's strange that people are quiet _ at all _ , much less on a train . 
  huge difference from ... well , anywhere i 've been , i think . 
  fwiw , their methodology is published ( [ link ] ( http://www.statistics.gr/portal/page/portal/esye/page-themes?p_param=a0704&amp;r_param=sel84&amp;y_param=2015_02&amp;mytabs=0 ) ) , but not the time series , which is always delayed . 
   this is coming in from the suburbs , it is n't the subway , it 's very civilized . 
  yeah , that 's what i was getting at , different notions of civility everywhere . 
  strange . 
   if you talk on your phone for more than one minute on my commuter train , you will be shushed . 
   seriously ? 
  i 'd expect different in a city of 8 million , at an age where the phone is the primary means of comms . 
  there 's almost no signal availability in the subway tunnels . 
  the most you 'll hear is somebody saying `` i 'm in the train , got no signal , i 'll call you later '' . 
  in the streets , i do n't think anybody actually cares , and they 'll have any sort of call while walking . 
  it 's pretty noisy anyway , so people assume nobody 's really listening . 
  greece ( for the mobile users ), 
  do you trust elstat , the agency which ez does n't trust at all and thus requested its independence in the laws voted into effect this morning ? 
  this is the uk we 're talking about , their whole culture is operating on the assumption nobody can be trusted to negotiate social contracts themselves . 
  the past 10 days . 
  in fact , i 'm planning to be away from `` home '' at least 65 % of the time for the next 12 months . 
  i 'm thinking i should stop paying rent altogether , maybe live in hotels or something . 
  no way !, 
  if you 're referring to [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3gubr8/greek_coast_guard_enters_turkish_waters/cu2m3yv ) , you 've provided a blurry picture . 
  thank you , though . 
  i honestly do n't think it 's your fault for being unable to prove what is n't there . 
  have a nice day . 
  the burden of proof is on the claimant , troll . 
  oh it is `` believed '' ? 
  come back with some actual news , cbs . 
  reported . 
  they do n't call them _ unpaid internships _ for nothing , do they ? 
  you should annex the ecuadorian embassy . 
  still some milk in that cow , huh ? 
  congratulations on earning the tag of `` troll '' . 
  the burden of proof is on the one making the claim , which in this case is you or the article . 
  the location of the event ca n't be determined by the video . 
  i for one dislike appreciation threads . 
  he 's still in charge . 
  he recently claimed he wo n't seek the presidency after his current term , which ends this month . 
  none that i know of , really . 
  i am familiar with only a handful ( greece , singapore , uk ) and one shared major flaw is that they 're easily subverted ( most notably by the state ) and their aim is not to produce critically thinking people . 
  their problems , however , ca n't be solved with a swift turn to _ somewhere else _ , they 're multidimensional and are rooted deep in their respective societies . 
  this has always been the case , though . 
  is it more pronounced nowadays ? 
  sure . 
  i for one am always tempted to attribute it to our dismal systems of education in the eu , where it 's seen long before it became commonplace in politics ( around 2006-7 here ) . 
  the `` immediate change of rhetoric '' on reddit , where opinions change every other submission ? 
  [ link ] ( http://t.co/yiscmmmplh ) for the lazy . 
  i 'm not going to believe anything they publish while georgiou is in charge . 
  you should write for the ft. 
  do n't be confused mate , smelly streets follow the brits , not the other way around . 
  you obviously subscribe to a less than mainstream definition of `` communism '' . 
  and `` causality '' . 
   eu is a communist hivemind . 
  greece : everyone 's out to get us . 
  i 'm not going to kindergarten debate with you . 
  `` freedom or death '' can pretty much be labeled universal . 
  besides greece , it 's been made famous by the struggles for independence of several countries : united states of america , brazil , bulgaria , the republic of macedonia , ireland , haiti , and uruguay . 
  it 's also been used in the baptist war , the chetniks , the culpeper minutemen flag , demonstrators in yugoslavia against signing the march 1941 treaty with the nazis , the defenders of the siege of barcelona , and probably innumerable other instances . 
  well then , since you want to examine events objectively , you should first be able to tell fact from interpretation . 
  the ottoman empire was partitioned and occupied [ after wwi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/partitioning_of_the_ottoman_empire ) . 
  that is a fact . 
  the turkish nationalists used this fact to fuel their ( reasonable ) interpretation of the war as a war of independence . 
  since nov 1918 , constantinople was occupied by the british & french ( fact ) , effectively leading to the collapse of the ottoman government ( interpretation ) . 
  and so forth . 
  it is perfectly rational and reasonable to consider that war being fought for independence of occupied territory . 
  what you consider as `` bullshit '' probably boils down to interpretations which devolve into aeon-old topics like what country has rightful claims over constantinople , essentially `` did not '' - `` did too '' exchanges . 
   the question was `` do you think greece can follow the reform list ? '' . 
  the vote came out at 95 % for no . 
   `` why not ? '', 
  are you surprised that different versions of history exist ? 
  now _ that 's _ interesting !, 
   it has 9 stripes , 5 blue 4 white alternating . 
  the number of stripes represent the saying `` freedom or death '' , with the 5 blue stripes representing the number of syllables in the word `` freedom '' , the 4 white the number of syllables in `` or death '' ( obviously in the greek language ) . 
   worth noting this is only an interpretation ( an alternative is they stand for the nine muses ) . 
  the actual rationale has never been documented . 
  the colour selection has never been precisely specified either , so flags with many shades of blue exist . 
  oh my god !, 
  now it 's spreading ? 
  i was n't aware `` reclaim the streets '' had any sort of political placement , but thanks . 
  this does not matter in the slightest in what we 're discussing . 
  the will of major political players shapes the rest . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  thanks . 
  it 's irrelevant to the discussion here , though . 
   our politicians ~ ~ were ~ ~ are absolute scum fixed . 
  that was not the question , but glad you 're not denying the impact germany 's finmin has . 
  i 'm not at all familiar with the dk , so i got ta ask : why do you think it 's the `` autonomous left '' ? 
  gah , you 're right .
