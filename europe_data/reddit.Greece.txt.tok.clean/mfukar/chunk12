  i do n't know what i was thinking . 
  what is the point of police announcements like these ? 
  does the russian police really need the drama ? 
  do n't they get enough attention and funding already ? 
   indeed but it is not as mosanto is going to make a 30 year long comparison study with biological field and disclose the results if they are not favourable to them . 
   if you do n't trust the results of the studies either way , why bother bringing them up . 
  itt : bigots pointing out half of citizens in 24 nations _ do n't _ have a negative opinion about immigrants . 
  i can only speak for myself , i consider the church ( not just orthodox ) an opportunistic sham , and any church that functions as an extension of the state an unfortunate waste . 
  as far as i know , there are n't any political plans to tax church property in greece , despite syriza 's pre-election campaign promises . 
  greece . 
  the orthodox church enjoys a lot of privileges . 
  it is a national church , which means there is a political connection between it and the state . 
  it owns a largely unknown portion of land ( for real ) , which is mostly free of the civilian tax code . 
  its income is liable to taxation , however there is no accounting system to detail its actual income . 
  it influences public opinion [ 1 ] and therefore politicians would rather not upset them . 
  the government swears a religious oath . 
  priests bless the start of the school year , and schools teach christian principles , and have had a mandatory religious prayer ( still do ? 
  who knows ? 
  i have n't been near one in years ) . 
  lessons pertaining to religion in state schools are limited to christian orthodox alone . 
  after the 2010 church 20 % levy debacle , the church claimed to have paid $ 2.5 m in property and corporation tax for 2010 ; it mentioned that it owns 30 properties in athens ( six of them unoccupied ) and 14 in thessaloniki . 
  the church is the second-largest ( documented ) landowner in greece , after the state , with about 130,000 hectares . 
  it 's up to the reader to ponder whether 44 properties can even occupy 130k hectares , and the implications of that . 
  [ 1 ] in 2010 the holy synod , a committee of 13 bishops , published a text circulated to all parishes condemning the imf , ec , and ecb as a `` foreign occupation '' force . 
  we tried this solution , and it did n't work . 
  why ? 
  because we did n't have any leverage in politics . 
   nominal gdp continued to drop at a slower rate than average prices . 
  i responded to the above , which is patently false . 
  even if it were true , your conclusion does n't follow . 
  like i said , you 're making a naive oversimplification . 
  even if a technical solution is required ( like on many other unrelated matters ) , its applicability , adoption , and ultimately success depends on politics . 
  yv admitted he never realised that until he was outside the negotiations . 
  yeah , let 's wait and see how austerity will work for finland . 
   it 's a matter of seeing the facts and past mistakes and then correcting them for the good of an entire country . 
  that 's a very naive oversimplification . 
  incorrect . 
  capital controls were instated because greek savers withdrew their deposits , as a result of the political and financial uncertainty caused by the government . 
  the [ deflation visualised ] ( http://t.co/6p065vfqsn ) . 
  you 're wrong . 
  also , nobody called it a `` success '' . 
  it was a necessary step to `` success '' , and it was in fact obliterated by the syriza govt . 
  just admit your trolling then shut the fuck up . 
  its genus , myosotis , comes from its greek name '' \u03c0\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9 '' : mouse 's ear . 
  lately ( and sadly , in my opinion ) , some have been calling them '' \u03bc\u03b7 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9 '' , which is the literal translation of `` forget me not '' . 
  s/he has no point , just look at their comments , constantly moving the goalpost . 
   producers ? 
  for real , brother/sister !, 
  i can imagine ; cheers for the info . 
  is it faster than , say , the average typist speed ( 50-80 wpm ) ? 
   i do n't understand why anyone would n't write cursive . 
  what 's the use ? 
  ( i 've never learnt cursive ), 
  no , not a trick question . 
  what are societies made to protect ? 
  i understand ; i really do . 
  with that said , take a moment to calm down and then consider _ who _ our society is built for . 
  cheers . 
  he wants the parents ' votes , they could n't care less about responsibility , kids , and parenting . 
  yeah man , that human rights thing is just an obstacle from our true purpose . 
  if he will threaten to do so , businesses in porn will simply leave the uk . 
  i doubt supply will cease for you united kingdomers , so your opinion on him wo n't change much . 
  why would you sell the goose that lays the golde-ehehehehehe , sorry , could n't keep a straight face irl . 
  redheads are the best . 
  but that 's probably not what you meant . 
  yeah , but it 's a nice place . 
  hahaha , `` you '' , hahaha !, 
  you ca n't question a report _ and _ accept it as fact , can you ? 
  what 's ridiculous about it ? 
  it 's pointing out certain facts . 
  maybe you think yv 's idea is ridiculous . 
  like the great philosopher ( s ) once said : `` you suffer , but why ? '', 
  rtfa, 
  it is _ you _ , sir , who suffer from title gore . 
   insignificant as part of syriza , if the left platform splits and he joins them he is n't insignificant . 
  he was the first in votes from syriza . 
  i 'll wait until that day to voice an opinion on how crazy they are . 
    varoufakis is blamed for treason because he is accused of working in this plan b without the pm 's knowledge . 
  no , read \u00a7 2 of the [ report ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/200031/article/ekathimerini/news/supreme-court-prosecutor-takes-action-over-varoufakis-affair ) . 
  if that does n't convince you what the complaints are about , reading the lawsuit text will . 
  that statement , as i wrote elsewhere , is the subject of a judicial investigation based on the _ allegation _ , and no related formal complaint or charges have been filed yet . 
  your question has a completely obvious answer : sidelining yv was the pm 's last chance to secure a deal . 
  it has been like that even before the referendum , when tsakalotos was preferred to head the talks ( late april ) . 
  now , getting involved with supporting yv , tsipras has nothing to gain , and a lot to lose : * there is no political gain from siding with yv , who the opposition resents , and is a convenient scapegoat * there is no gain in terms of electorate , where yv is irrelevant * if any of the allegations against yv are true , the pm will do well to be disassociated with him ( and them ) by all accounts , varoufakis is on his way out of relevance and politics , and tsipras is very wisely letting it be that way . 
  edit : and today , july 31st , tsipras backs up varoufakis completely . 
  how fucking stupid can one be ? 
  none of the two filed complaints involve your statement . 
  a third one , about the issue you refer to , prompted a judicial investigation into it , but _ it has not been filed yet _ . 
   he 's bigger threat to the opposition than tsipras , as you said the most likely scenario is that tsipras/pasok/nd / anel and maybe potami will form a coalition government . 
  which will be the main opposition to that coalition government ? 
  the left platform . 
  in case you have n't noticed , half of syriza/pasok/nd / anel comprise more than 200 votes in the parliament . 
   all the leadership belongs to the part of syriza that supports the agreement , especially after the recent reshuffle . 
  i suppose you 're agreeing with me , this supports my argument : yv as opposition is insignificant . 
   we say the same thing , he needs the votes of these parties to be able to govern . 
  without the votes from the opposition he wo n't be able to pass the necessary laws . 
  no , i 'm saying he _ has _ the votes , as evidenced by the two major parliamentary votes on `` reform packages '' already . 
   most importantly , if he confirms that he asked varoufakis to prepare a plan b in case talks break there 's no implication that varoufakis worked on his own . 
  i fail to see how that 's in any way relevant , or how it constitutes tsipras offering yv 's head . 
  the pm cooperating with the finm to prepare the country for all possible outcomes ?
