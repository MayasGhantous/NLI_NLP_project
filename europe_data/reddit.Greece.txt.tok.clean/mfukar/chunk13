  treason !, 
   all this is just games from his political opponents . 
  the opposition despises varoufakis because they believe he 's the most prominent voice against the bailout agreements . 
  they control most of the media that launch a relentless campaign against varoufakis . 
   that makes no sense . 
  he barely talks in greek media . 
  he 's no threat to the opposition , either . 
  _ yv is simply a most convenient scapegoat for everyone , at this point . _  at the same time his party ( syriza ) does n't really support him since he went against the party 's line and voted against the agreement that tsipras brought in the parliament . 
  there are two parts of syriza , both significant in size - even if he belongs to the one opposing tsipras , it 's not that the whole party opposes him . 
   at the same time tsipras can not govern without the votes from the opposition . 
  yes he can , _ at least _ pasok/nd and large part of anel voted for the two first `` reform packages '' in the parliament , and despite official party lines , these parties are very likely to form a coalition gov with him . 
   so it 's probable that he offers the varoufakis ' head in exchange for their support . 
  the [ legal complaints ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/200031/article/ekathimerini/news/supreme-court-prosecutor-takes-action-over-varoufakis-affair ) were submitted by the mayor of stylis ( apostolos gkletsos ) and the lawyer panayiotis giannopoulos . 
  there is a third complaint , also ~ ~ filed ~ ~ brought up by civilians . 
  all of this , of course , is outside tsipras ' duties , authority , and influence . 
  pointing fingers _ is _ satisfying . 
   companies for example pay something like 1300 e annually regardless of income , profits , size . 
  false . 
   companies for example pay used to pay something like 1300 650 e annually regardless of income , profits , size . 
  also false . 
  businesses in greece do n't pay any flat tax ( es ) , they never did since 2006 which is as far as i know . 
  wait , rabbits are rodents ? 
  beautiful british answer . 
  does he smoke ? 
  you 're obviously unaware of the conditions unskilled labourers face in singapore . 
  primarily , i was there alone . 
  the rest , i do n't really remember . 
  no idea mate . 
  i 've only been there once , ~ 10 years ago , and did n't like it one bit myself , but that probably says more about me than the place . 
  yes , thank you , i 've read the comment . 
  and i ask again : what about the unskilled workers , which _ are not _ mentioned in the comment ? 
  are they unwanted ? 
  do you bring them when you need a new skyscraper erected , and have them live in the construction site , singapore-style ? 
  something else ? 
  of course , i 'm only trying to point out the inadequacies of `` schemes '' like these , which are hatched in reddit comments in the span of a couple sentences , only to die a few minutes later . 
  i have , thank you for the laughs . 
  there is a large supply . 
  what about them ? 
  where do they fit in the grand plan ? 
  that 's the most superficial critique of two major religions i 've ever read , thank you for the laughs . 
  jolly good . 
   over the past few months immigration submissions have become more and more common . 
  so common , in fact , that they are drowning out any other form of original discussion or links to other interesting events in europe . 
  the above seemed to indicate it was a problem with the frequence of said submissions . 
  if the problem is people do n't report them , then the megathread does n't solve that . 
  if it 's that certain users submit said content in a pattern , then surely a team of people ( in / r/askscience they do n't have full privileges even ) who are informed as to said pattern can identify it and report it/them . 
  the `` tools for analysing users '' will not come from reddit . 
  i do n't suppose you ( the mods ) have plans to implement something of the sort . 
  well , off we go then . 
  i 'm going to the beach . 
  anybody else ? 
  i 'm sure you 've considered this , but what about increasing the size of the moderating team a la / r/askscience ? 
  he 's full of shit regardless of handedness . 
  it 's slang for `` you do n't get it '' . 
  watch the big lebowski some time , it 's nice . 
  it 's a good idea to group information after it 's been vetted , not feeding a megathread with all sorts of crap and expect it to be easier to moderate or read . 
  are you in jail yet , / u/pixeltje4 , or do i have to call the po-lice ? 
   and we 'll end with sweden . 
  islamists want to to open an asylum accommodation . 
  and they have ties to left wing parties so they will likely get their way : http://www.friatider.se/islamister-vill-starta-asylboende-i-sverige[4]  oh no , an asylum ? 
  whatever will the swedes do ? 
  heartbreaking . 
  moderation would be nice . 
  what religion contradicts the code of european law ? 
  it 's a rhetorical question . 
  do n't answer . 
  maybe we should actually try to have a discussion _ before _ we proclaim we ca n't have one , yeah ? 
   immigration should be about offer and demand : one country needs more skilled workers , that country accepts those skilled workers . 
  what about unskilled workers ? 
  of course . 
  we have hedgehogs too , but i meant porcupines , specifically [ crested porcupines ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_world_porcupine ) . 
  from what i 've read , it seems they came from italy . 
  porcupines are fairly common in the countryside here , and the poor guys are too slow and usually die when crossing the roads ( _ splat _ ) . 
  also , the [ crete spiny mouse ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crete_spiny_mouse ) , sometimes . 
  the only time i 've seen a house mouse , it was dismembered by my sister 's cat . 
  i agree , it 's definitely a hard problem , otherwise we 'd have solved it . 
  i 'm not saying all immigrants integrate , nor that they have any sort of obligation to do so . 
  only that they need to integrate to a degree in order for the action of migrating to have any sort of meaning , i.e. 
  _ not _ ending up worse than they started when they decided to migrate . 
  after all , integration is the most effective way for them to realise the potential of migration , not the only one . 
  thanks i 'll watch that later . 
  then do that . 
  for the record , i 've found the netherlands model _ seems to _ work best , but i 'm not exactly an expert or anything on the topic . 
   do we really wish to , at large , cling to ` legality ' as the arbitrary and deciding factor of any given thing 's , though laws in particular rightness , necessity , or justification for being ? 
  yes . 
  if you want to argue that drug laws in sweden are ineffective , do n't present the question whether laws everywhere are ineffective as a homology ( _ because it 's not _ ) . 
  your neat pseudo-paradoxical usage ignores the [ facts ] ( http://www.canorml.org/healthfacts/drugtestguide/drugtestdetection.html ) as well as none of the related timing windows surpass the statute of limitations . 
  if you 've used , you 've used . 
   he wo n't be ~ ~ persecuted ~ ~ _ prosecuted _ to the full extent of the law . 
  ftfy nothing about this is impractical . 
  if police know x is a drug user , therefore violates a law , their duty is to arrest them . 
  end of story . 
  let them advocate their innocence or why they should get special treatment _ in court _ . 
   referring to the usa as having `` hegemonic force '' is n't a propagandistic misrepresentation , it 's an accurate description . 
  `` hegemonic force '' is n't used as an _ attribute _ of the usa , though , it 's used as a synonym , a `` stand-in '' as the article says . 
  in that sense , it is used to demand you to fill in what the metonymy does not explicitly include ; it wants to entice you to expand your reasoning toward the rest of the whole that is not referred to by it . 
  countless instances of advertisements or propaganda use or abuse that power of metonymy . 
  sure , but you can do these things without reinventing the language , just manipulating logic . 
  50m may be pushing it . 
  make it 25 , the gain in accuracy justifies it ( _ because i say so _ ) .
