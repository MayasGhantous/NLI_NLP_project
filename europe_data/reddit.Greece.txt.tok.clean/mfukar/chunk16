  this clearly does n't apply . 
  even in the absence of any unions , countries can cover their budget costs with loans , and any creditor that wants their money back only cares about that , and not the long-term health of the lender , which is exactly why they do n't care about the budget , even though they should ( _ moral hazard _ ) . 
  the events of the last 5 years have made it abundantly clear that it 's not only the lenders inside the eu that have misbehaved . 
   the eurozone clearly do not care about the rules at all , which has led to this disaster . 
  the ez has very vague and loose rules , which allows everyone to play this charade ad infinitum . 
  the $ is a monetary union with no well defined duties for member states , which contributes to the harmful trends we 're seeing displayed all over our screens . 
  well , i would n't say malaria is `` spreading '' ( [ link ] ( http://www.keelpno.gr/el-gr/%ce%bd%ce%bf%cf%83%ce%ae%ce%bc%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%b1%ce%b8%ce%ad%ce%bc%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%b1%cf%85%ce%b3%ce%b5%ce%af%ce%b1%cf%82/%ce%bb%ce%bf%ce%b9%ce%bc%cf%8e%ce%b4%ce%b7%ce%bd%ce%bf%cf%83%ce%ae%ce%bc%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%b1/%ce%bd%ce%bf%cf%83%ce%ae%ce%bc%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%b1%cf%80%ce%bf%cf%85%ce%bc%ce%b5%cf%84%ce%b1%ce%b4%ce%af%ce%b4%ce%bf%ce%bd%cf%84%ce%b1%ce%b9%ce%bc%ce%ad%cf%83%cf%89%ce%b4%ce%b9%ce%b1%ce%b2%ce%b9%ce%b2%ce%b1%cf%83%cf%84%cf%8e%ce%bd/%ce%b5%ce%bb%ce%bf%ce%bd%ce%bf%cf%83%ce%af%ce%b1malaria.aspx ) ) , there 've been 0 outbreaks this year _ so far _ , and max 42 transmitted domestically during the last 5 years . 
  you do n't need to be so aggressive , / u/angry _ spaniard only pointed out some facts . 
  interesting you point out the land registry , what 's incomplete [ about it ] ( http://www.ktimatologio.gr/sites/en/aboutus/pages/qoqhyncvtozm6ajs_en.aspx ) ? 
  it definitely exists for a long time , and afaik registration is mandatory , although i 've had no extensive experience with it . 
  your questions , i think , highlight an important aspect of the problem nobody has addressed so far : greece 's ( and every other eu country 's , actually ) budgets are public information - we know , and everybody can know , what the greek , dutch , and french govts spend their money on , and how much of it . 
  it 's been known , for a long time , how much money went to e.g. 
  pensions , and how they were invested , and so forth - yet until the point of _ almost _ no return , no body seemed to seriously bother with that data . 
  now i 'm not saying it 's the eu 's fault for not keeping greece in check , but there could definitely be some sort of audit or questions raised , before it 'd come to this . 
  known henceforth as the sieve of kmjn . 
  pit them ( literally ) against each other , have some sort of bet going on . 
  it looks pretty old , are you sure it 's only a week old ? 
  sounds just like home . 
  yeah , ok , but for the purposes of discussion , let 's stick to the universe with no unicorns in it . 
   if they are so desperate , maybe the best alternative was to suspend their constitution and to invite a foreign administration to rule the country for 30 years ... yeah , ok , but let 's stick to the universe without unicorns for the purposes of discussion . 
   `` we still believe that we have the right to criticize all religions , '' the editor said , adding that he did not want to believe that the magazine `` was possessed by islam . '', 
  the title is editorialised . 
  sourisseau said _ he _ would no longer draw , and that `` the mistakes you could blame islam for can be found in other religions '' . 
  clearly not the sort of surrender the useless title implies . 
   yeah let 's compare a newspaper to a satire piece . 
   can we even compare quality commentary with newspapers ? 
  * sigh * no , it does n't have to be . 
  there 's about 10-12 more threads which are n't about men 's issues , people can talk there as well . 
  there 's the one from / u / _ samss _ , and people can talk there too - or not talk , if they do n't want to . 
  of course , the problem is multidimensional . 
  one could write a book on it . 
  you have to realise that `` everyone '' actually means `` everyone at a given time '' . 
  in particular , new voters without first hand experience of the relationship of nd/pasok with corruption may not find out about it until it 's too late . 
  similarly , those who have n't experienced syriza 's governance , those who do n't keep up with current events , or are attempting to find out about them from biased sources , etc. 
  do n't know the whole truth , and are thus making choices others do n't consider as rational , or good alternatives . 
  another contributing factor is that politics , up until recently , is n't exactly a hot topic of serious discussion ( at least in greece ) . 
  4 major fires in the suburbs of athens from negligence in the same day is highly improbable . 
  kathimerini [ reports ] ( http://www.kathimerini.gr/823928/gallery/epikairothta/ellada/mainontai-oi-fwties-se-ymhtto-kai-neapolh-lakwnias---nea-metwpa-se-eyvoia-kai-argolida ) the first fire at imittos reportedly started after explosions were heard , so arson is a possibility for at least one of them . 
  you nailed the time , it 's in the same decade , but not the place . 
  more recent than that . 
  good guess , though !, 
  there 's just not enough food here - i wonder what the french have . 
  where do i sign up ? 
  hint : the above refers to famous polish soldier during the event we 're looking for . 
   i suppose not everyone is able to get a job even if they try their hardest but i was raised in a household where i was told that no matter what situation you are in , if you bite the bullet and work hard , you 'll be able to get out of it . 
  same here , unfortunately that 's not the case , for too many reasons . 
   it 's better to ask these questions than to leave them unsaid , right ? 
  damn right . 
  your basic premise is unsound . 
  even if everyone puts in work , the system can still fail . 
  unemployment benefits and pensions are another form of expense for a government , just like spending on education or infrastructure . 
  all these expenses can be associated with corruption , risky behaviour , and mismanagement . 
  simply eliminating expenses is not enough to boost an economy , as the greek case study has proven . 
  the assumption behind your solution is also faulty , i think . 
  where is the data which shows the correlation ( let 's leave causation aside ) between voter demographics and public spending , or corruption , or to put it in terms of your own introduction : _ why and how do the votes of unemployed people become a detriment to the country 's spending behaviour & fund allocation ? _ there 's a ton of questions your plan raises that do n't have easy or obvious answers , too . 
  what ~ ~ other ~ ~ drain is removed , as you put it , when you eliminate pensions and benefits ? 
  what other drain is introduced , at the same time ? 
  what about private pension funds - where do they fit in this plan ? 
  if you do n't eliminate them , does it promote `` healthier '' spending & lending behaviour among the population , and how does that correlate with government spending ? 
  it 's an interesting question nonetheless ; why do you think people will try to find work _ in order to vote _ ? 
  what is the incentive for them to do so ? 
  has this idea been studied ? 
  anybody got subtitles or a translation ? 
  yeah , everybody 's right in the global kindergarten . 
  oh , poor you . 
  the passions are full of examples of injustice . 
  of course , as a hero-centric work , the narrator is trapped in its own point of view , considering unjust the behaviour of people foreign to them ( fellow countrymen , with whom he identifies ) or enemies . 
  he sees the world fragmented , and its goods unevenly distributed - who does this remind you of ? 
  from personal experience , he knows love for material goods and greed are leading to violence against others ( him ) , their humiliation , their ignominy , and extermination . 
  he deplores the lawful distinction between right and wrong , just and unjust , every system of law which benefits some and discriminates against others . 
  the poem , although wonderful , does n't describe today in the slightest , imo , but that 's for the future historian to judge . 
  there 's more interesting stuff in the parts op conveniently has to omit , elytis ' hero 's validity of suffering is challenged in two points : injustice towards them begins not only from external enemies , but their own behaviour , and secondly , the hero himself admits regardless of his initial denial to use the same weapons of injustice , he too commits unjust acts . 
  his desperation clouds his mind , leading to inability to judge friend from foe . 
  i guess he knew what responsibility actually meant . 
  elytis was far wiser than you , op . 
  you nitpicking on excerpts to present your pathetic petition distorts his work completely . 
  you should be ashamed of yourself . 
  for those that want to read a decent analysis of elytis ' axion esti ( `` worthy it is '' ) , from where this passage is taken , see [ here ] ( http://www.fryktories.gr/sites/fryktories.gr/files/fileresources/axion_esti_elyths.pdf ) . 
  you should read a bit about incentives . 
  you 'll get more credible information about this at your country 's embassy and/or ministry of foreign affairs . 
  it 's very reassuring that our ex finmin is just as passive-aggressive as the average reddit troll . 
  elstat is independent in principle . 
  however , there have been a ) accusations that unnamed public sector people have approached them and [ asked them to withhold information ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.gr/2015/01/07/oikonomia-elstat-elleimma_n_6429314.html ) ( sorry for the huffpost link , but it 's the first i could find in a rush ) , and b ) the ex-president & 2 members [ are accused ] ( http://news247.gr/eidiseis/oikonomia/poinikh-diwksh-se-varos-toy-proedroy-ths-elstat-gia-to-elleimma-toy-2009.2096205.html ) of falsifying the 2009 deficit from 12 % to 15,4 % in order for more stringent measures to be implemented by the govt . 
  mr. andreou has given to the court [ a letter from papandreou-papakonstantinou ] ( http://olympia.gr/2014/02/12/%ce%bf%ce%bb%ce%bf%ce%ba%ce%bb%ce%b7%cf%81%ce%b7-%ce%b7-%ce%b1%cf%80%ce%bf%cf%81%cf%81%ce%b7%cf%84%ce%b7-%ce%b5%cf%80%ce%b9%cf%83%cf%84%ce%bf%ce%bb%ce%b7-%cf%84%ce%b7%cf%83-eurostat-%cf%83%cf%84%ce%bf/ ) , then pm and finm respectively , which asked/ordered ( i 'm unclear which ) him to inflate the deficit . 
  the president , vice president , and two more members of the seven in total of elstat are appointed by the presidents of the parliament , at the recommendation of the finmin . 
  one more member is appointed by the governor of the bank of greece , one more by the finmin , and one by the association of workers in elstat . 
  ( [ source ] ( http://www.hellastax.com/html/2010-n/n3832-10.htm ) ) you can see that currently elstat 's `` independence '' is only superficial . 
  the wikipedia article is complete rubbish . 
  even if i were kind , i would say it 's inaccurate at best . 
  it presents information selectively ( andreou claiming the deficit is 15 % , backed by some completely irrelevant letter from the czso ?? ), 
  and omits crucial information . 
  do n't trust wikipedia for anything other than a _ very _ broad description . 
  papandreou 's perception is positive because he allowed ( bad choice of word - _ allowed _ makes it seem as if he was impartial , which he was n't ) huge amounts of funds from the eu to be squandered , ~ ~ and ~ ~ by letting his clientele ( voters ) prosper . 
  while pasok was in power , corruption was so common it became normal and an end in itself . 
  his governments cemented , in the people 's mind , the benefits of the public sector we 're now ( allegedly ) trying to get rid of . 
  the impact he 's had on greece today is n't even touched in the wikipedia page - i wish i could find a few good sources to suggest to you here . 
  i have the feeling tsipras will be trying to take advantage of the situation today to start a similar era , but maybe i 'm giving him too much credit . 
  of course not . 
  he 's widely regarded as a scam . 
  charismatic , sure , but corrupt is not a strong enough word for him .
