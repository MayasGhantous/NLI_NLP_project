  i do n't see the figure you seem to be quoting on those links . 
   i have a hard time believing he went to those meetings for three months not realizing he was no longer in academia . 
  given my brush with academia , i find the number completely convincing . 
  got a source for that `` 55 % '' number ? 
  lynched ? 
  nah , you 're not thinking big enough . 
  in 40 years , he 's going to be widely regarded as the next [ andreas papandreou ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andreas_papandreou ) . 
  hey , i know , a referendum !, 
  our govt , the same one which does n't post any documents on their ministry of finance website ? 
  yeah . 
  we might as well bang our collective heads against the nearest wall . 
   this is precisely one of the reasons we do n't want to join the currency union as it inevitably means fiscal union . 
  i 'm confused . 
  is n't the result of all this the lack , or rather outright hostility towards any fiscal convergence ? 
  i have no idea what the `` british left '' stands for , so i ca n't answer your question . 
  plus , i too consider the abolishment of collective bargaining and trade unions beneficial for greece , so any answer of mine is unlikely to satisfy you anyway . 
  plus , this is a completely different context than my initial comment , so . . 
  guardian columnists , on a guardian site . 
  no , that is how you 're reading it . 
  i was responding to a very specific dismissal of the people who probably had some input ( via imf ) on the bailout ( s ) , on no particular grounds . 
  ( _ or on the grounds this link was posted by someone greek , which is an argument as much as my dog is a cat _ ), 
  the guardian , interpreting clear sunny skies as a result of being separate from everything else . 
  oh , so when the imf , top economists , and financial analysts write the same things , they 're clearly in greece 's pocket , yeah ? 
  it 's not possible they know what they 're talking about , or did you even bother to read and comprehend their arguments ? 
  we did not . 
  in fact , it was well known from before 2012 we did not have enough reserves to do so , and known from february 2015 ( when syriza assumed duties ) we did n't even have the cash for it . 
  this is exactly the point . 
  the ez is not viable , and people warned of exactly this from as early as 1997 ( [ arnulf baring ] ( http://www.amazon.de/scheitert-deutschland-arnulf-baring/dp/3421050953 ) is the first that comes to mind ) and our politicians are the only ones who fail to acknowledge it . 
  please , we all know only the german parliament needs to approve it . 
  creditors ' incentives are not aligned with the long-term health of their lenders . 
  mixing these up is what the term _ moral hazard _ is about . 
  well , that is what competing religions do . 
  yeah , swedish models are great . 
  oh , you meant ... oh . 
  no , it 's not possible to prevent the next default . 
   ... only in 2020 . 
  ... only in 2022 . 
  i think you vastly underestimate how little time 5 years is , in this context . 
  all of the protests in the last 6 months have been peaceful , with no significant violent events - isolated incidents do happen , like for instance a man attempting to beat a photographer in the protest last thursday ( 9/7 ) evening at syntagma sq. 
  advice to bring a lot of cash is very sensible in the current situation , but does not constitute `` unrest '' . 
  there were ( are ? ), 
  warnings about lack of imported goods but besides specialised medical products , they have not been observed yet . 
  certainly not enough deficits to spark _ any _ kind of unrest . 
  now do n't get me wrong , worrying about those things is very prudent and definitely not unfounded given the current situation . 
  however , greece during the last two weeks was very far ( and still is ) from the humanitarian crisis certain media outlets try to paint . 
  i do n't know how to convince you of that other by saying that making a claim like that puts the burden of proof on those outlets - if you 've seen such proof , i have n't . 
  i think your country 's embassy ( or any embassy , for that matter ) in greece would 've assured you there 's nothing wrong with travelling to gr for your vacations , but would definitely advise you to take some protective measures - they 'd be stupid if they did n't _ ( edit ) even now _ . 
  what unrest are you talking about , exactly ? 
  if people cancelled trips to greece , i 'm near certain they were misinformed or at best overly cautious about the financial instability of the last 2 weeks . 
  all i 'm seeing is spam . 
  so they 've made clear that the eu is a financial project - hardly anything to frown at . 
  fraternity , solidarity , respect , these words mean nothing at the level of the eu , and the events of last year ( not only regarding gr , but immigration , telecoms , etc. ), 
  have made it abundantly clear . 
  if some people are now disillusioned , so be it , maybe they 'll learn to be more skeptical about these grand projects . 
  we 'll have a whole new routine by then . 
  thank you . 
  loved your early work , i think it 's only getting better . 
   krugman like all other economist suffer from one problem ... they are a hoax ... social sciences don \u00b4 t exist because they can \u00b4 t predict results go ahead , tell me krugman [ ca n't predict results ] ( http://www.hamilton.edu/news/polls/pundit ) one more time . 
  well if you forget your point between two comments , i ca n't really do anything . 
  what is your alternative ? 
  if not now , when ? 
  germany 's protecting germany 's interests . 
  i 'd say your govt is doing an excellent job , at the risk of looking like a big bully . 
  pr is n't everything . 
  the way tsipras used it : empty words , and they do n't matter now anyway . 
  pricing imported goods in $ fosters a black market ; nobody in their right mind would do that . 
  if they did , consumers would want to hang onto $ anyway , so demand would drop sharply , no incentive to import . 
  with a new currency , let 's call it drachma , you 'd start at 1:1 , but it would quickly devalue . 
  as such , importers ( & exporters ) face a perverse incentive : devaluation of the currency means that if i wait to import goods until after the currency devalues , i would make so much more money in drachmas , assuming the goods ' price ( $ ) remains the same . 
  thus , i have no incentive to buy now , but rather wait . 
  thus , demand for imports drops sharply , so does domestic supply , leading domestic consumer demand to rise sharply , thus inflated prices , and more profit for me . 
  without govt regulation , this is another instance of a black market . 
  now , those are very simplified scenarios , but they have been observed in practice . 
  i think one ought to be more careful when making blanket statements like `` halted imports ... '' , it never is the whole truth . 
  he won a nobel for being consistently wrong about [ everything ] ( http://www.hamilton.edu/news/polls/pundit ) , too . 
  technically , it was n't tsipras , but the first paragraph of the maastricht treaty . 
  not if our lawmakers write it . 
  damned / r/europe , undermining our carefully thought out immigration strategy !, 
  i never said anything of the sort , but go ahead , vent . 
  you have every right to be amused . 
  i simply do n't want to participate just for the sake of participation - that does n't mean nothing to me . 
  it was obvious , at the time the referendum was announced , that it meant nothing and the govt 's intent was unrelated to the question it posed . 
  i do n't feel betrayed , because i did n't vote ; neither in the referendum nor the elections . 
  i 've lost any hint of trust i ever had in this country 's people and their representatives . 
  btw , did you guys see why yv is missing tonight 's parliament vote ? 
  [ check this out ] ( https://twitter.com/yanisvaroufakis/status/619553236798828544 ) . 
  translation :  fortunately there are people who respect what it means to want to spend the weekend ( '' \u03a3\u039a '' ) with my little daughter before she returns to australia where she lives ... talk about respect and responsibility . 
   ( edited : apparently yv 's behaviour is completely normal . 
  carry on . ), 
  psh , as if a footballer would say something like that !, 
   that has nothing to do with earlier governments , that 's the direct result of syriza 's policies and behavior . 
  one argument why ~ ~ this ~ ~ that is not the result of syriza 's policies is [ here ] ( http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5965.html ) . 
  . . and one world cup ? 
  downvoted for not avoiding triumphalism . 
  questionable majority ? 
  they did just get 61 % of the people to go along with them last sunday , remember ? 
  this will translate into parliament majority one way or another . 
  you should know that thepressproject is endorsed by syriza ( for [ instance ] ( https://twitter.com/yanisvaroufakis/status/616805263912357888 ) ) and routinely [ writes to dismiss views that might hurt syriza 's public image ] ( http://www.thepressproject.gr/article/79065?fb_action_ids=10153466979218724 ) . 
  they 're pretty much the sounding board of the party . 
  not to imply there is n't any truth to the article , but it 's blown way out of proportion .
