  that 's the funniest thing i 've read all year . 
  it was n't scrapped , it 's still in effect . 
  however , there 's a major problem with it : you do n't actually have to have the receipts _ at all _ !, 
  you can get away with declaring , say , $ 2000 in expenses , and nobody ever requesting you to produce them for an audit ( said audits are conducted on a very small sample ) . 
  that 's one of the reasons they came up with a receipt card , a kind of automated system for keeping track of receipts , but that suffers from the same lack of incentive . 
  yes , of course there are fines ( also jail sentences , and so forth ) . 
  there are also investigators ( [ sdoe ] ( http://www.mnec.gr/?q=el/content/%ce%b5%ce%b9%ce%b4%ce%b9%ce%ba%ce%ae-%ce%b3%cf%81%ce%b1%ce%bc%ce%bc%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%b5%ce%af%ce%b1-%cf%83%cf%8e%ce%bc%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%bf%cf%82-%ce%b4%ce%af%cf%89%ce%be%ce%b7%cf%82-%ce%bf%ce%b9%ce%ba%ce%bf%ce%bd%ce%bf%ce%bc%ce%b9%ce%ba%ce%bf%cf%8d-%ce%b5%ce%b3%ce%ba%ce%bb%ce%ae%ce%bc%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%bf%cf%82-%cf%83%ce%b4%ce%bf%ce%b5 ) ) . 
  yup , consumers currently have no incentive to request a receipt . 
  of course , but there 's a fair bit of risk in that assessment . 
  most notably , a greek exit leaves almost no control to germany over how it will be handled , and it could very quickly devolve to some more eu banks blowing up . 
  _ according to the wsj , anyway . _ , 
  to play devil 's advocate against our two data points , sdoe reports it receives hundreds of reports of tax evasion each day . 
  the problem definitely exists . 
  is humanitarian aid really cheaper than the alternative , then ? 
  same here , it 's [ sdoe ] ( http://www.mnec.gr/?q=el/content/%ce%b5%ce%b9%ce%b4%ce%b9%ce%ba%ce%ae-%ce%b3%cf%81%ce%b1%ce%bc%ce%bc%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%b5%ce%af%ce%b1-%cf%83%cf%8e%ce%bc%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%bf%cf%82-%ce%b4%ce%af%cf%89%ce%be%ce%b7%cf%82-%ce%bf%ce%b9%ce%ba%ce%bf%ce%bd%ce%bf%ce%bc%ce%b9%ce%ba%ce%bf%cf%8d-%ce%b5%ce%b3%ce%ba%ce%bb%ce%ae%ce%bc%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%bf%cf%82-%cf%83%ce%b4%ce%bf%ce%b5 ) . 
  according to their own data , they get hundreds of reports each day . 
  i do n't know about the language barrier , but i 've often ( i.e. 
  almost every other day ) had to do it in england . 
  very recently , too . 
  i think as long as you 're polite about it , there 's not going to be a problem . 
  until it 's ready , you can dial ` 1517 ` and report it directly to [ sdoe ] ( http://www.mnec.gr/?q=el/content/%ce%b5%ce%b9%ce%b4%ce%b9%ce%ba%ce%ae-%ce%b3%cf%81%ce%b1%ce%bc%ce%bc%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%b5%ce%af%ce%b1-%cf%83%cf%8e%ce%bc%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%bf%cf%82-%ce%b4%ce%af%cf%89%ce%be%ce%b7%cf%82-%ce%bf%ce%b9%ce%ba%ce%bf%ce%bd%ce%bf%ce%bc%ce%b9%ce%ba%ce%bf%cf%8d-%ce%b5%ce%b3%ce%ba%ce%bb%ce%ae%ce%bc%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%bf%cf%82-%cf%83%ce%b4%ce%bf%ce%b5 ) ( damn , they do n't even have an english translation ? 
  wtf ), 
  you have a point , and in my eyes you 're 100 % right . 
  in my experience , since 2013 i 've never had an incident where a store owner offered me a cash discount , or did n't produce a receipt . 
  data point of one , i know . . 
  i find the notion that the greek people would prefer tsakalotos to take his notes in greek when conversing with foreign dignitaries disconnected from reality , and somewhat vaguely decadent . 
  the article contains no info whatsoever . 
  i hesitate to speculate . 
  in shops that accept them , yes you can and there 's absolutely no problem with the process during capital controls . 
  however , some small shops may not accept cc payments ( they do n't have a merchant account , etc ) . 
  transportation ( edit ) _ in athens _ is currently gratis , but you can buy tickets with your cc . 
  see ? 
  no surprise !, 
  then you will not be surprised in the slightest !, 
  they understand greek , [ quote the law ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3cizwp/holidaymakers_in_greece_ask_for_receipts/csvz7it ) . 
  know your rights . 
  fyi , retail receipts look like [ this ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-irfxwxa8-3k/t7zy3j6qa4i/aaaaaaaabto/1hn3digdorw/s640/%ce%91%cf%80%cf%8c%ce%b4%ce%b5%ce%b9%ce%be%ce%b7+%2327+%ce%95%5b%ce%bf%cf%84%cf%81%ce%b1%cf%80%ce%ad%ce%b6%ce%b9%ce%b1+%cf%80%ce%b1%ce%b9%cf%87%ce%bd%ce%af%ce%b4%ce%b9%ce%b1..jpg ) . 
  plainly __ refuse __ hand-written receipts if the shop has a cash register . 
  know that you are entitled , by law , to refuse payment for goods and services _ altogether _ if the business denies to provide you with a receipt . 
  the law in question is \u03a6\u0395\u039a \u0392 ' 3313/12 -12 -2012 ( [ text ] ( http://www.taxheaven.gr/news/news/view/id/11671 ) ) , relevant part , quote :  `` consumer is \u039d\u039f\u03a4 obliged to pay if the notice of payment has \u039d\u039f\u03a4 been received ( receipt \u2212 invoice ) '' -- apparently , some people thought i advocated for `` stealing '' goods from shops and then claiming you were n't given a receipt . 
  on the contrary , i mentioned it as a means to pressure the business to provide you with a receipt , not get you into trouble for theft . 
  guys , girls , get on with the narrative : we all need to be as good as the french , and our products on par with french ones . 
  and we 're not . 
  and that 's sad . 
  why are we doing that to france , guys , girls ? 
  why are we doing that to the eu ? 
  are we bad ? 
  are we a wee bit bad ? 
  contrary to popular belief , attacks can not only be carried over the internet . 
  ever since before they took office , i was convinced they ( syriza ) are incompetent morons ( occam 's razor ) . 
  what does that have to do with anything ? 
  if he 's good at his job , let him speak aramaic , for all i care . 
  i doubt anyone else does . 
   `` avoid triumphalism ... unlike your predecessor '', 
  again with the delusional scenarios . 
  nothing like that is going to happen . 
  oh , flair also shows whether we 're nationalist , now ? 
  man , this sub is _ full of features _ !, 
  the objective value of a building is accounted for in purchase & resale of property . 
  the possession tax , since 2011 , is based on flat coefficients according to the zone rate ( emergency property tax ) and only accounting for age ( not the special coefficient ) . 
  taxation from income is independent of the objective value . 
  not disputing the document , just summing it up . 
  there is no such law , which mandates a different amount of tax for housing `` under construction '' . 
  there 's nothing related to your claim in a tax form - either you live somewhere or you do n't , and its `` under construction '' status is irrelevant . 
  in 30 + years of living here , i 've never once seen or heard anything like your claim . 
  i urge you to quote the related law , if you could ( it should be easy , just click the related field in your tax form and you 'll get a short text quoting the relevant legislation ) - i assume you 've submitted your taxes in greece ? 
  how does that work ? 
  [ this ] ( http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5965.html ) is the best analysis i 've read on why the problem is systemic and will effect all of the eu . 
  personally , it does n't completely convince me , but that 's irrelevant , just like the referendum and its outcome . 
  there are [ very good arguments ] ( http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5965.html ) for debt relief which do not involve shoddy ww2 flashbacks . 
  personally , i 'm not for them . 
  btw , tfa argues against debt relief for greece , which is why we 're having this discussion , is that not right ? 
  the only transfers allowed by greek banks at the moment are those to accounts in other greek banks . 
  it 's not doing more than said , it 's an action included in the controls announced last week . 
  even by newspaper standards , this piece is way too late . 
   although an eu task force may be required should greece crumble into civil disorder once savings are converted into drachma . 
  wow , people must think this place is kind of like south africa , or the west bank . 
  i do n't know what your comment means . 
  the article itself points out : `` the circumstances under which greece accumulated its debt are strikingly different '' . 
  therefore , attempting to use greece 's lack of post-ww2 germany 's geopolitical advantages as a means to reject debt relief is unsound . 
  if debt relief should be denied to greece , it will be justified in other means . 
   it will use the debt relief to provide free electricity to households , subsidize rents , restore christmas bonuses to pensioners , raise minimum salaries -- that is , to return to the practices that led to the accumulation of greece 's debt . 
  it is an extreme case of moral hazard , which the post-war german governments conscientiously avoided . 
  where there are no arguments and sound logic , rhetoric always turns to morality and emotion . 
  see [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3celhi/in_work_poverty_rates_by_eu_country_for_people/csut8t9 ), 
  just post the [ whole text ] ( http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5965.html ) , which is a much better analysis than anyone in / r/europe would ever post . 
  no , any negotiating team from athens , regardless of party , would have to have the backing of the opposition right now , because it increases trust if they all commit for reform / additional measures to be taken . 
  it 's important to show the referendum was n't a leverage stunt ( even if it is - _ especially _ so ) , but something meaningful came out of it . 
  if you were a eu official , letting one of the ez countries suffer an economic meltdown in this manner is not political leverage so much as it is an acceptance that the $ is not a stable currency . 
  everybody loses if gr defaults . 
  ~ ~ i can confirm ; i have n't been able to withdraw $ 60 from an atm since last wednesday ( 1/7 ) . ~ ~ i was able to withdraw $ 60 in $ 20 bills this morning , so . . meh ? 
  is n't that what 's happening right now , a fiscal matter turning geopolitical ( do n't forget the moral spin ! ) ? 
  it 's almost as if the two are intertwined . 
  i think you should read [ this analysis ] ( http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5965.html ) .

  it 's not my table , it 's barclays ' , dated april 2015 .

  and you have to acknowledge that creditor incentives are against maximising the long-term value of an enterprise , in this case gr .
