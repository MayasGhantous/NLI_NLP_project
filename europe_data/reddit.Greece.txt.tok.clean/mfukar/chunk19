  [ official exposure to greece in emu , by country ( 2015 ) ] ( https://twitter.com/livesquawk/status/617827164264771584 ) edit : and i 'm done in replying to statements by perverse incentives , so [ here ] ( http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5965.html ) is somebody actually tearing your point apart . 
  i guess it works on many levels !, 
  wishful thinking , my friend . 
   if it means that nations unsure about their own economic situation wont take the euro because they perceive it as a risk , its perfectly fine . 
   and where does that leave the $ with regard to other currencies ? 
  a bigger risk , therefore failed currency . 
  half of them ca n't tell left from right , so they drown . 
  nobody left to paddle , then . 
  a hero ? 
  you guys , you love to use that word , do n't you ? 
  people are voicing a lot of things , most of the time . 
  not all of them are captains of a ship . 
  well , there 's no upper bound . . 
  you left out incompetence . 
  i did write  everyone did n't i ? 
  i 'm not expecting anything . 
  because that 's exactly [ what he 's referring to ] ( http://www.transparency.org/cpi2014/results ) , corruption perception index . 
  it is done , to the best of my knowledge . 
  of course , this system has only one way to be circumvented : do n't initiate a transaction , pay/get paid in cash . 
  that behaviour is common in greece - do n't know about bulgaria so i could n't compare . 
  i 've also commonly seen it in the uk , for instance , so it does n't say a lot ; the cpi accounts for multiple factors beyond this specific instance of tax evasion . 
  i assume nothing other than what you wrote : `` some of us '' - if you did not mean that , obviously you 're not in the same camp . 
  why is everyone being deliberately inflammatory ? 
  it 's beyond irresponsible . 
  judging by your answers to other comments , it 's clear you 're not interested in any reasoning anyone provides . 
  the truth is , we have a word for your attitude , and it 's `` discrimination '' . 
  you are attempting to cast a ( very ) thin veil over it with platitudes like `` we have no moral obligation to help them '' , or `` we did no harm to africans '' , and `` why should i pay for ~ ~ africans ~ ~ people that i have nothing in common with ? '', 
  - the answers to these questions are given by the values that connect us as europeans and humans . 
  if you do n't like them , at least you know which side you 're on . 
  you are quite misguided if you think the `` oligarchs '' can get punished inside the system they 've built for themselves . 
  if you are letting resentment toward the older generations guide your choices , then you 're trapped in the same cycle without even knowing . 
  and let 's not pretend , your words show a person so young , that has n't ever experienced `` chaos '' ; when you do , you 're not going to like it very much . 
  good luck . 
   i mean , i 'm nearly certain that they could get more out of their loans in a cooperative marshall-plan-style rebuilding effort than as adversarial assholes . 
  it _ does _ make a lot of sense . 
  _ in fact , this possibility seems more attractive the more the greek economy shrinks . _  they 're going to create a nationalistic problem like the golden dawn if they are n't careful - this is n't monopoly money , it 's peoples lives they 're asking to shut down . 
  `` oh hey just stop paying retirees , i 'm sure that 'll be fine '' ... really . 
  that 's exactly what 's happening , and syriza 's rhetoric is straight up building upon it to get their way in the referendum , as well as the possible elections to follow . 
  do n't worry , the greek society is already deeply divided since time immemorial . 
  well , yeah , all the people that are going to vote for `` no '' . 
   they 're basically turning down 50 % payback of the loans outstanding in favor of 0 % payback of the loans , it totally confuses me . 
  it does seem confusing , but the key insight here is that there is still time , despite how grave the situation seems . 
  if , at the very last second , creditors can get anything more than 0 % return on any loan under any circumstances , they will choose that over allowing a haircut . 
  that and the fact that most creditors are n't actually singular entities , but parliamentary bodies , where a host of misconceptions and motives prevent logic from holding any weight in similar discussions . 
  a `` no '' is complete absolution for syriza . 
  then , when they realise nobody trusts them to uphold any agreement , they will lead the country to elections , amidst total economic meltdown . 
  argentina _ did well _ ? 
  holy shit , talk about redefining the narrative . 
  look , it 's an attractive interpretation , surely . 
  however , it involves a lot of hand-waving over facts , attributing them all to the same motive which runs through the entire interpretation : the conservatives that rule ez do n't want to see a left-ish , nationalistic success story . 
  that part is not self-evident . 
  nobody 's giving free money to greece , they 're _ lending _ . 
  that 's a fiscal term . 
  ecb is providing liquidity to the banks , holding it steady . 
  the decision to force capital controls was taken by the b of greece , as a result of the bank run which started early last saturday , 27/6 , after the pm 's announcement of a referendum . 
  it 's not facts , it 's an interpretation of the facts the public is aware of . 
  there 's a lot of facts we do n't know ( e.g. 
  why did the ecb play hide-n-seek with the imf report ? 
  etc ) , and motives we will never know . 
  your comment was irrelevant to my answer anyway . 
  i 'm not going to address conspiracy theories or play the greek gov 's and your blame game . 
  have a great weekend . 
  i did n't justify anything based on my opinion . 
  just the facts . 
  cyprus cooperated and is outside immediate danger and growing . 
  fact . 
  i 'm not going to address more absurdities . 
  the assumption being that imf possesses malicious motives towards the countries which comprise it . 
  that is clearly absurd . 
  all of that was done based on strictly technical arguments , which reinforced the informal beliefs ( which is what friends mostly , if not only , consider ) that gr would be able to repay their debt in the future . 
  where is such a document and what are its terms ? 
  why is n't it an official proposal by the ec ? 
  are we to take yv 's word for it ? 
  that would be the very best , and similarly improbable , result . 
   then the rest of eu stepped up and helped with the dept. 
  let 's stop referring to loans as `` help '' , it creates a false impression . 
  the nature of loans is fiscal . 
  so what you meant was that the price of bitcoin blew up ? 
  i guess that may be true . 
  cheers . 
  37.5 % for b of cyprus , 80 % for laiki , and 22.5 % of uninsured deposits attracting no interest . 
  and what was the social `` blow up '' ? 
  i do n't know that , but i 'm not following cyprus very closely anyway . 
  you may be right . 
  his wife 's monthly pension has been de facto reduced to $ 120 . 
  she wo n't be able to afford food for the month , let alone a toy for their grandchild . 
  nothing blew up , cyprus cooperated with the imf and is already doing better . 
  i 'll cover a few : * `` sunday 's referendum is not about whether our country will stay in the eurozone '' false . 
  both choices of the referendum have consequences which _ can _ result in greece 's exit from ez , and [ other countries warn of this ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/29/greek-crisis-referendum-eurozone-vote-germany-france-italy ) , which implies there is at least the intent . 
  * `` this is a given and no one should question this '' nothing is a given , and everyone with half a brain should question things . 
  it 's how we advance as individuals and a species . 
  * `` on sunday we will choose whether to accept the institutions ' agreement or whether , with the strength of the people 's verdict , we will seek a viable solution '' false . 
  there is no ` agreement ' ( sic - he means ` proposal ' ) to be accepted , it 's been withdrawn . 
  a viable solution is not mutually exclusive with said acceptance , either . 
  * `` i want to reassure the greek people of government 's firm intention to reach an agreement with its partners , with conditions that are sustainable and will provide for the long-term '' '' _ conditions that are sustainable and will provide for the long-term _ '' is very vague . 
  their unilateral course of action is out of touch with said intentions , therefore their intentions mean nothing . 
  i skip through equally vague promises to the next one : * `` the prevalence of extreme conservative forces led to the decision to asphyxiate our country 's banks -- with the obvious aim of blackmailing not just the government , but each each citizen individually '' it was the bank of greece which decided and enforced capital controls , not some vague `` extreme conservative force '' . 
  the reasons was the govt failed to reach an agreement _ on time _ .
