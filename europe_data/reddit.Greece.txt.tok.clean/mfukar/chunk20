  * `` it is unacceptable in a europe of solidarity and mutual respect to have these disgraceful images '' appeal to emotion . 
  the issues gr faces are not emotional . 
  * `` the greek government , despite the financial asphyxiation , took the appropriate measures and made sure that pensions were paid and deposited into the accounts '' meaningless . 
  in _ one _ ( 1 ) instance , my father ca n't withdraw money from his pension account , because the nearest open bank is in heraklion , a ~ 50km drive away from his residence in crete . 
  i will note there is in fact an atm much closer to his residence , at about 200m , but it 's empty since friday . 
  since this is an anecdote , you may very well consider it a lie . 
  moving on . 
  * `` the proposals that they tried to blackmail us in order to accept demanded huge pension reductions '' a necessary step , since the pensions are a large part of the govt 's debt , built up over the years , and funded indirectly ( read : via taxation ) from the meager private sector . 
  the proof of the second part of the last sentence is there has been no pension reform yet , and syriza has vehemently denied proposals including it , so far . 
  * `` and this is why they are retaliating today '' nobody 's retaliating , the greek govt has caused all this mess . 
  * `` the self-evident alternative was to reach out to the people '' presenting something as self-evident does not make it such . 
  * `` they are trying to blackmail you as well , and ask that you vote yes on all the measures requested by the institutions , without any prospect of exiting the crisis '' in november , greece [ was growing ] ( http://www.marketwatch.com/story/greek-growth-rates-put-germany-eurozone-to-shame-2014-11-14 ) , a tangible and quantifiable prospect of exiting the crisis , which has been annihilated since syriza came to power . 
  the `` blackmail '' he 's referring to is pointing out the potential exit from the ez , which has been a visible conclusion for 5 + years now , nonetheless . 
  * `` they want you to side with those in parliament who have repeatedly said yes to all the measures that have burdened the country . 
  to become one with them . 
  complicit in perpetuating the memoranda '' i will stop after this one , because this one makes me both supremely disappointed and furious . 
  what kind of country leader , what kind of elected official utters such words ? 
  separating greek people in `` us '' and `` them '' is unacceptable , under any terms . 
  it is clear this is a speech aimed at supporters of a party , and not destined to address reasonable people . 
  it is not addressed to citizens , but those who still can , but are n't , completely taken over by fear . 
  an individual that acts in this reckless , dividing manner can not be trusted . 
  they are hiding the truth , the are not revealing their agenda up until the last second ( as they have already done ) , and they are either dangerous or dangerously mindless . 
  that 's about enough for now . 
  i 'll be glad to substantiate any claims you think are n't supported by facts , although you could easily find them by googling serious reporters and major news outlets ( e.g. 
  bloomberg , hugo dixon , the greek kathimerini , and so forth ) . 
  all the parts . 
  i think you 're reading into my one line things i 've never written . 
   correct , but fact is the biggest consequence of a default is the fud i will respectfully disagree . 
  i wrote a [ little bit ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3bm2gl/kathimerinigr_reports_that_tsipras_is_backing_down/csnfvr9 ) yesterday about what the referendum actually means . 
  nothing . 
  its character and result are debatable . 
  it literally means nothing . 
  so , yeah . 
  all this was a political bet . 
  they lost it . 
  they 're capitulating . 
  the credit rating agencies are behind the facts on this one - the ccc - rating by s&p is ... generous . 
  the consequences are n't changing however you call insolvency on a debt . 
  the imf is using this wording to avoid spreading fud in all similar situations . 
  re : your last paragraph , the latest events show that he 's neither capable nor trusted to implement any agreed upon measure . 
  we are , therefore , heading for new elections . 
  `` marxist revolution '' _ within the party _ , yes . 
  i still think if that happened , it would be quickly contained . 
  i do n't see any real threat for the republic at this moment . 
  even if a pretext for that were to present itself in the near future , at whose behest ? 
  nobody has that sort of influence over the army now , and the army by itself is quite disorganised . 
  again , not to be dismissed downright , but very unlikely . 
  sad indeed . 
  it frustrates me - infuriates , really - that people are n't better informed , better educated , willing to throw these populist trash in jail , where they belong . 
  anyway , back to work i go . 
  have a good one . 
  which polls are those ? 
  do you have any source ? 
  the one in the guardian is ocr-scanned . 
  it contains artifacts common during the process , as undertaken by some ocr products . 
  you 'll notice the text and general layout is the same . 
  i see you have your own populist problems , eh spain . 
  you 're asking a loaded question . 
  it is obvious to me , and not in hindsight ; we knew since january that if people refused to pay taxes , there would be no primary surplus , as it predictably happened then . 
  most people in gr are n't well informed , or well educated , or unbiased - if the media or govt spin things a certain way , they will believe them , as it is happening . 
  the fact of the matter is that a tangible and quantifiable improvement was annihilated by the current govt ( the bailout program was , until last night , common between the two govts ) . 
  that 's all i 'm saying . 
  greece 's economy is so shrunk that even the minute growth number makes a difference . 
  these numbers are n't normalised over eu members , so your counterpoint does not apply . 
  according to kant , '' _ deficiency in judgement is properly that which is called stupidity ; and for such a failing we know no remedy _ '' . 
  i like kant . 
  it 's not obsession mate , it 's what 's apparent . 
  maybe it 's not likely , but `` absolutely no risk '' is not something to be said lightly under the circumstances . 
  you 're giving them too much credit . 
  a govt that ca n't handle a fire burning garbage for 3 days , that ca n't utter rational word in constant interviews , consisted of people who serve interests of their clientele and themselves , does n't have a plan . 
  by all things apparent , they do n't add up . 
  now , just because there 's no plan towards a goal , does n't mean we wo n't reach that goal . 
  however , they 're just trying to get political approval . 
  limit their exposure . 
  because in any functional democracy , the pm and finm would n't last a week after leading their country to a default and capital controls . 
  yes , we 're in a difficult time . 
  however , the worst is not here yet . 
  i do n't , i 'm well aware and i know eu history ( ding , ding ) . 
  agreed , and agreed . 
  you have to expect such statements to be taken out of context , though . 
  this is the face of panic , and everything will be used to serve whatever interests are at stake currently . 
  that 's a big leap mate , i do n't think we 're going full retard , yet . 
  the talks had a timeframe . 
  the greek govt elected a course of action _ outside _ said timeframe , nullifying the subject of the talks : a solution to a program ending _ yesterday _ . 
  that is a unilateral , and stupid , move . 
  their ministers and appointed lackeys ( see \u03a6\u0395\u039a 460/26 .6.2015 - google the names appointed at \u039c\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0392\u03b9\u03bf\u03bc\u03b7\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 \u0397\u03c0\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5 ) are documented by serious news outlets to be strong-arming citizens to vote `` no '' . 
  it [ is documented ] ( https://twitter.com/dspinellis/status/615505619899056129 ) the form chosen for the ballot is intended to ~ ~ provide ~ ~ bias up to a 6 % of votes to `` no '' . 
  _ update _ : a few minutes ago , the pm separated the greek citizens which he was supposedly addressing to `` us '' & `` them '' , and equated those who will vote for `` yes '' to `` accomplices '' to the perpetuation of the programmes . 
  i 've never been more insulted and sadder in my entire life . 
  those are n't words used by a leader , those are n't words of an elected representative of the people , period . 
  their only choice , in the face of a rational vote , is to resign ; not even that move would be responsible , or timely . 
  i sincerely do n't see how a rational citizen could be defending them . 
  why is it dumb ? 
  it 's the elephant in the room . 
  the euro is on the rise today ( so far ) . 
  time to remind everyone that the greek economy was actually the fastest growing in the ez in ~ ~ january ~ ~ november [ link ] ( http://www.marketwatch.com/story/greek-growth-rates-put-germany-eurozone-to-shame-2014-11-14 ) . 
  that is , pre-election . 
  what ? 
  there 's no way the pm and finm survive this week . 
  definitely not in the political sense .
