  `` arrears '' is a euphemism , to allow the ecb to delay declaring banks insolvent until monday . 
  the premise being that bitcoin can be used for transaction in gr . 
  it can not . 
  it will not , either . 
  delusions . 
  bitcoin has no relevance whatsoever , especially in a country with low tech literacy like gr . 
  thankfully , the union is n't hostile to greece or its interests . 
  it 's hostile to the tax evaders , to a clientelist system , to corruption - all of which survive today . 
  see [ here ] ( https://twitter.com/macropolis_gr/status/616128964780785668 ) . 
  ca n't vouch for it , obviously , but it 's out there . 
  its projection ( 37 % ) is also very far from the 60 % `` polls are reporting '' . 
  you are trivialising a complex situation . 
  6 months ago it was election time , the result of which was the syriza-anel coalition government . 
  maybe it 's a coincidence , i do n't know . 
  what i do know is that up to that point greece was the fastest growing country in the ez [ [ link ] ( http://www.marketwatch.com/story/greek-growth-rates-put-germany-eurozone-to-shame-2014-11-14 ) ] , and last night we defaulted on an imf payment . 
  whether the referendum is constitutional is [ under question ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_bailout_referendum,_2015#campaign ) . 
  the result of the vote may also be ignored , as [ it is questionable ] ( http://elawyer.blogspot.gr/2011/07/blog-post_31.html ) ( text in greek ) whether it constitutes a binding or advisory vote . 
  there 's lots of leeway for the govt to do whatever they like , sadly . 
  -- edited according to [ kathimerini ] ( http://www.kathimerini.gr/821544/article/epikairothta/politikh/pyretwdeis-diavoyleyseis-gia-lysh-thn-ystath-wra ) , the cabinet can submit another proposal to cancel the referendum process , but i do n't see any sources or citations as to how that works . 
  i presume with the consent of the president , but i 'm just grasping at straws here . 
  take it with a pint of salt . 
  i was n't making _ any _ point . 
  you must be confused . 
   blaming the measures imposed by the troika for the entire thing is illogical at best . 
  that 's a much better and logically supported point to make , contrary to questioning arbitrary start and end points of measurement . 
  that 's all i 'm saying . 
  i say it here , it comes out there . 
  well come back when you 've put some thought behind anything you write , we 'll be thrilled to read it . 
  you 're not making a lot of good points . 
  questioning the definition of the gdp is a totally different subject . 
   that point is not supported by the photos . 
  have a nice day . 
  the answer to your question is yes . 
  i 'm sorry , it just is . 
  countries are represented by their elected officials and their actions , end of story . 
  anything else is just refusing responsibility . 
  the imf is a fiscal institution , what else would they care about ? 
   the greek gov has been trying to convince us that their propositions are for the better of all the eu citizens , they are not trying to make us hate anyone at this moment , tsipras is blaming the `` institutions '' for forcing capital controls on greece , whereas the decision was taken by the bank of greece . 
  just one drop in the sea of polarising rhetoric over the last 6 months . 
   solidarity between the europeans is a term that is used on most of their talks . 
  meaningless terms are meaningless . 
  this is n't about ethics in fiscal unions . 
   greeks are not that brainwashed by the media , yet . 
  yes , we are . 
  the media and syriza are using divide & conquer , in plain sight . 
  most greeks are oblivious to this fact . 
  it 's clear at this time that somebody is lying to the greek people , in particular about the events and documents surrounding the referendum . 
  whether that 's the government or the ec , maybe we 'll never know . 
  syriza has not even attempted to tackle those problems . 
  you 're begging the question . 
  op is cherrypicking facts to make the title 's point . 
  that point is not supported by the photos . 
  simple . 
  on sunday , ecb decided _ not to extend _ the amount of emergency liquidity . 
  has that decision been reversed ? 
  i have no news of it . 
  again , irrelevant - you make a choice at election time , and you implicitly accept the majority vote . 
  if you want to be able to assassinate a king that you do n't deem fit , go live somewhere where you have that choice . 
  we both live in republics , with clearly defined rights and obligations . 
  this rhetoric is irrelevant . 
  that does n't mean all previous governments have n't been equally corrupt ( - ed ) . 
  i fail to see how committing to an informed choice , like taking a loan , equates to slavery . 
  give me a second , i 'll ask my master . 
  i knew it , damn them !, 
  the enforcement of capital controls , in the face of nearly total panic , is proof the banks are very close to bankruptcy . 
  i 'd urge you to take some time to think about that , and not reply to my insignificant comment . 
  it was a parliamentary committee , they have n't reached a conclusion yet , but as of now , they 're only spewing propagandist nonsense without actually having done _ anything _ specific . 
  it 's easy to use the imf as the scapegoat , when they 're the last measure called upon just before the shit hits the fan . 
  the fact of the matter is that countries that cooperated with them are out of immediate danger . 
  i hope you find a way to reconcile that within your grand conspiracy theory . 
  i like that you 're optimistic . 
  here 's to hoping you 're also right . 
  varoufakis himself lays out the answers to the first part of your comment [ here ] ( http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2015/06/28/as-it-happened-yanis-varoufakis-intervention-during-the-27th-june-2015-eurogroup-meeting/ ) . 
  note the date of 27/6 . 
  he essentially confirms your viewpoint , they _ are _ only attempting to establish a political foothold , even if their basis for it is completely bogus . 
  the fact that meetings continued says nothing about what happened inside . 
  it is exceedingly clear , for instance , since a meeting without yv was held right after the eurogroup , that the talks were not being conducted on the same grounds any longer . 
  the rest is up for interpretation . 
  i wonder how could an offer , any offer , be still on the table given the expiration of an imf payment of $ 1,546,466,270 today which is not going to happen . 
  talks , or `` negotiations '' if you will , are n't happening in good faith anymore , the greek govt made sure of that . 
  at this point , i honestly do n't see this situation as reversible . 
  it could have been before the inane call for a referendum was made . 
  i 'll have a look , thanks !, 
  i know this argument , especially since it 's espoused by economists ( including those you mentioned , whom i happen to follow for some time ) . 
  however , i have n't seen any proof for it , nor the corollary which they accept implicitly , namely that it is the cause of failure for all greece , ireland , spain , etc. 
  i would very much like to be proven wrong . 
  if you could point to a purely technical argument , i 'd love to read it . 
   there is no logic in that . 
  precisely , as it completely ignores any and all factors into play . 
  austerity has worked with other countries in debt , during the last 5 years . 
  it has n't worked in greece because of very specific pathologies which the current govt is not tackling . 
  maintaining authority . 
   funding/helping greece loans are n't `` help '' . 
  let 's stop referring to them as such , it creates a false impression . 
  tsipras [ opposed it then ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzelcaw99ly ) . 
  [ in greek ], 
  the government sets the question , via approval from the parliament . 
  i 'm in total agreement , but i doubt they actually will . 
  both your and paul232 's points are good in principle , and unfortunately they 're both irrelevant . 
  the government _ can _ have both the same vat for everyone and help local businesses , but they choose not to , and stick to superficial matters like a ~ ~ 6 ~ ~ 7 point increase on the vat ( based on the text [ here ] ( http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3a%2f%2feuropa.eu%2frapid%2fpress-release_ip-15-5270_el.htm&amp;sa=d&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=afqjcngl6-0jhurgwqy5nuka8jk_ic3bsg ) ) .
