  no , it can be faked . 
  there 's no way to verify radio transmissions , much less recordings like this one . 
  the content is also easy to fake after the turkish statements about the incident . 
  does that pathology justify _ anything _ ? 
  within 17 seconds the turkish f-16s notified af hq , who notified the pm , who gave the order for shootdown . 
  mythbusters ? 
  which one did the russian pilot hear , i wonder . 
  i see you 're just trolling me . 
  go to [ the question ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3u229m/turkish_f16_shoots_down_a_warplane_on_the_syrian/cxbakhg ) , answer it , or troll some more , i do n't care . 
  what are you asking _ me _ for ? 
  damn . 
  it 's just the initial parts of my name mashed together . 
  what did nato ever do for us , anyway ? 
  it is ? 
  well , all the more reason to break nato up !, 
  what does that have to do with the comment ? 
  to remind you , it questioned the timing of an escalated response to constant violations . 
  nothing about greece in it . 
  again with the one sentence oversimplifications . . 
  abandon that sort of thinking , it wo n't get you very far . 
  your comment irks me . 
  just break up nato . 
  and 60 % of their natural gas from russia . 
  it 's a valid question nonetheless . 
  the timing is suspect . 
  i did n't see him offering a `` conspiracy '' as an explanation . 
  maybe you 're projecting one . 
  having endured a constant stream of turkish-greek dogfights as reported by biased media over the past 15 , maybe 20 , years , i would be extremely surprised the turkish army acted as rashly as this stream of comments attempts to paint them . 
  shooting down an aircraft is serious business , and nobody would go that far for flying 6km in sovereign territory - we should just admit we do n't know all the facts . 
  it 's a complex legal and political situation , that which you 're attempting to reduce in one sentence . 
  for those that care , [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aegean_dispute#national_airspace ) outlines the issue quite well . 
  have a look before following the media ( of both countries ) which give it a nationalistic spin , without ever actually outlining the truth : that both countries have , in fact , a valid reasoning and ca n't work around this issue with kindergarten logic . 
   if it came to direct war not the case . 
  underestimating ? 
   we will not tolerate a religion that actively supports genocide and violence . 
  he does n't know up from down . 
   now , they can present themselves as martyrs and draw even more support for their cause you 're supposed to employ sarcasm and absurdity with things that are n't true . 
  try 14 , buddy . 
  damned if you do , damned if you do n't . 
  nah , we can just write long , baseless sentences without understanding anything . 
   what about all those racist well educated people ? 
  racism is n't linked to anything , the un only publishes stuff like that to say `` if you 're racist you 're obviously stupid '' . 
  while to most it does n't matter how you look aesthetically ( which is all race is ) , you have racists in all walks of life , what about people who do n't like ginger people , there is no difference between being prejudice against someone based on hair colour than skin colour . 
  yeah , 5 incoherent sentences alluding to a conspiracy theory carry more weight than an actual scientific study . 
  i would love to see your sources supporting the claim that age is a good indicator of voter responsibility , or even an informed vote - a _ proxy for competence _ . 
  then we can talk about quantifying it , then we can talk about preferential treatment of age over other indicators , and then about finding a good age to give people voting rights . 
  the banks were n't expecting the stress test to quantify their shortfalls . 
  ideally , they should have been planning for weeks now , if not months , and all that would remain is for those plans to be adjusted to the shortfall indicated by the tests ' results . 
  i have no idea what you are talking about . 
  care to [ explain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_cyprus_and_the_european_union#legal_situation ) ? 
  it 's a good thing we 're also even more modern , and not backwards idiots . 
  also clueless . 
  oh no , whatever will they do . 
  he should hold a referendum on whether to become sultan . 
  if he wins , gg . 
  if not , ask tsipras for help . 
  various places , my favourite is this one on east coast rd , `` sin hoi sai eating house '' . 
  little family business . 
  visit it , you wo n't regret it . 
  since i 'm travelling between athens & singapore right now , i 'll post my cheapest choices available for both ( no drink , no dessert ) : singapore , chicken rice ( ~ 1/2kg of chicken - some would argue this is lunch for 2 ) , sgd $ 7 , that 's $ 4.53 today . 
  athens , cheese-chicken-bacon sandwich , ( ~ 1/4kg of chicken ) , $ 4.8, 
  a lot of many groups of people do n't drink . 
  your argument is _ still _ shoddy . 
  alcohol in turkey costs 15 % of its minimum wage . 
  as a tourist , it is certain that 's not a high figure _ for you _ . 
   well drinking is forbidden in islam . 
  most do not follow the quran to the letter , just like most do n't follow the old testament to the letter - even if you 'll find morons reciting `` an eye for an eye '' anywhere . 
  your ` analysis ' is misguided . 
  as much as 85.8 % .

  all the other ones below it telling him he 's a fucking idiot , but you 're right , i 'm probably wrong too . 
  the deliberate myopia in this sub , holy shit . 
   do n't feel pain , they ca n't suffer pain may be the only source of suffering for you , but certainly not everyone . 
  whatever . 
  thanks for commenting . 
  if that 's where you 'd choose to spend your money , maybe keep them for yourself . 
  buy a lamp or something . 
  i already explained a reason why the most proximate land route is not accessible , but let 's review : greece & turkey have a tense relationship , their land border consists of a an uncharted minefield and a river , on both sides of which there are constant armed patrols and guardposts every so often . 
  the turkey-bulgaria border is not so tightly , but similarly locked down . 
  you ca n't pass those routes without getting inspected ( and summarily deported ) . 
  search for articles regarding recent attempts by refugees to cross from turkey into buses , which were stopped by turkish police . 
  the land routes carry a high risk , and low probability of success . 
  the sea routes , which everybody seems to already know so well due to the diligent coverage of the media , carry high risk , but thankfully high probability of success due to international maritime ( and eu immigration ) law . 
  the way i would think of it , although it 's by _ far _ removed from the problems a refugee in turkey even considers , is it 's more probable to sail from turkey to a greek island , rather than attempt to cross a fucking uncharted minefield . 
  again , there are things we _ could _ do to offer safe passage , but we do n't . 
  why ? 
  in my eyes , we do n't seem to give a fuck . 
   i have voted . 
  i do n't know how to spend money for these issues . 
  donations are a popular choice . 
  i 'm not arguing semantics and how big your safety nets are . 
  i do n't care . 
  i struggle to see what argument you 're trying to make . 
  yes , there are safer ways to travel in the med than rubber dinghys . 
  no , there are not more accessible ways for the refugees . 
  yes , those conditions are not satisfying to any human . 
  want to change it ? 
  vote or spend your money accordingly . 
  i do n't know what else to tell you , but you 're being passive aggressive at the wrong person . 
  it occurs to me you might be trying to appear deliberately dense to suggest that the refugees are risking sailing in boats to greece & italy rather than a land route which might entail border patrol and customs because `` they 're not actually refugees '' but `` economic migrants '' , in which case , fuck off .
