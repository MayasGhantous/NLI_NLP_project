  first , the med is not an ocean . 
  second , let go of bullshit assumptions . 
  yes , there are safe ways to transport people from syria , turkey , israel , egypt , or libya into the eu . 
  the eu is not doing that . 
  we have _ elected _ not to provide any sort of aid to a refugee _ unless they 're on eu soil _ . 
  a perverse incentive , upon which smugglers have thrived . 
  apparently , it 's so out of the question nobody will consider _ helping _ potential refugees to apply for asylum . 
  so what choices does an immigrant have ? 
  if you have valid papers and money , everything 's at your disposal . 
  you do n't have to sail the med unless you _ like _ to - board a plane and you 're done . 
  if you do n't have money , well , tough luck : the land routes to enter the eu are strict and almost impassable . 
  entering by plane is out of the question . 
  the sea route is not exactly a free-for-all _ unless _ you choose to pay smugglers . 
  and why would you pay smugglers if you have the money , i hear you ask . 
  well , because you do n't have valid papers . 
  the turkish authorities wo n't recognise your syrian id . 
  you may never have gotten a passport . 
  you have to circumvent them , or die , or waste n years of your life away in a shitty `` camp '' while your skills disappear , your kids are deprived of basic goods & education , and your hopes of rebuilding a life quickly diminish to 0 . 
  there are multiple minefields , even uncharted , inside the eu , deployed from many years ago ( e.g. 
  i 'm not saying they were deployed in response to this `` crisis '' , that would be stupid . 
  nevermind extraordinary measures . 
  what country in their right mind would unilaterally violate an extradition treaty with the us ? 
  probably 0 . 
  this vote is one of the stupidest ever proposed in the ep . 
  i see you 're just trolling . 
  greece is in the eu . 
  turkey , not so much . 
  what safer ways are there to make the transition ? 
  land border of turkey with greece or bulgaria ? 
  not a chance . 
  minefields and _ strict _ patrols make it nigh impossible to cross . 
   no policies related to the agreement have been implemented yet . 
  which is why the first $ 2b cash has n't been released by the ec yet . 
  [ related story ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/05/us-eurozone-greece-iduskcn0rz22x20151005 ), 
  we 're fine with fairy tales , goodbye . 
  hahahahahahahahahahaha . 
  oh you 're serious . 
  well let the ra sue the university , see how well that fares . 
  the relevant parties . 
  do n't act like they ca n't . 
  and there 's a solid basis for this legislation as well , which some people would rather think it does n't exist or can be circumvented by going about sprinkling wars willy-nilly . 
  and eu countries ca n't ? 
  eu countries with several times more reliable infrastructure in place ? 
  please . 
  think before you write . 
   no refugees will ever be allowed to settle down in europe this is what you want , so just shout it as loud as you can , instead of trying to support it with baseless hypotheticals . 
   the media chooses to follow a left-wing bias once more i keep seeing this reference to imaginary `` left-wing media '' . 
  it 's a nice story , but where is it happening , really ? 
  yes , it does . 
  you do n't understand the technology . 
  one can not have both end-to-end cryptography _ and _ retain keys without backdoors . 
  that 's what end-to-end means , that end parties control the functionality . 
  oh , you do n't like it that people are starving in your reality ? 
  some things are true regardless of your _ taste _ . 
  i do n't mind with you repeatedly showing your ignorance . 
  i just thought _ you _ might . 
  you 're obviously not quite aware of what 's happening in gr . 
  i suggest you refrain from making embarrassing comments . 
  agreed , who could really understand the potential implications in such a short timeframe given . 
  certainly not most people . 
  indeed , the government completely ignored the vote result . 
   also as for the no side i always thought they did n't support greece leaving the ez . 
  well , not to worry . 
  the facts have been distorted so much it 's difficult to make sense of the whole debacle . 
  the `` no '' vote was presented as the acceptance of a grexit by ( some ) eu leaders . 
  indirectly , that 's exactly how it was presented inside gr , too : the proposal ( which at the time was retracted ) was presented as an ultimatum , to which the people wanted to basically give the middle finger . 
  that was the understanding inside the gr government as well ( see , for instance , varoufakis ' accounts of the meetings leading up to his resignation ) . 
  that was n't reflected on your parliament 's vote on the agreement . 
  so , who cares . 
  maybe that good part should meet up with the gr `` referendum '' `` no '' side . 
  the elephant in the room . 
  let 's see how for how much longer will it go ignored . 
  out of today . 
  ho-ly-shit . 
  i ca n't handle any more stupid for today , i 'm out . 
  and the fourth set , overlapping all others , of people who do n't understand a word marx wrote . 
  you mean you 're currently not ? 
  well that certainly requires a change !, 
  `` put '' . 
  `` we all have put '' . 
   remote surgery excuse me ? 
  the same argument is used by rape apologists . 
  trash , of course . 
  if you 're trying to get me to be sympathetic towards politics , you 're barking up the wrong tree . 
  i consider clinging to falsehoods neither polite nor respectful . 
  why do you keep defending your ridiculous premise ? 
  people ca n't just will themselves out of some situations , period . 
   the reptilian brain takes over stahp, 
   the left-right labels seem to break down when it comes to religion , for whatever reason probably because the terms `` right-left '' are meaningless for decades now . 
  til i 'm not european, 
  misogyny is leftist ? 
   put every meter a police/soldier at the coast ? 
  but suddenly this is feasible on the boat 's destination . 
  if he had said `` surviving '' , it would be within quotes . 
  what 's insulting is to think the writer knows and can use a quotation in one sentence accurately , but not in the next . 
  i really do n't see what we 're arguing here . 
  to clarify - the kid in question was alexandros grigoropoulos and the defendant 's lawyer _ claimed _ the shot was a ricochet . 
  the ballistics report concluded it was [ a direct shot ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_100010_23/12/2008_103269 ) and thus he was found guilty of second degree murder . 
  it 's now 7 years since that incident , wow . 
  warning shots are still illegal , however , same as any usage of firearms .
