  it was an eye-opening experience , to say the least . 
  useful in a let 's - hope-i-never-have-to-use-this-shit way . 
  i do n't shoot as a hobby , although i used to hunt with my father in the past . 
  are you aware that greece is undergoing a depression for the past 6 years ? 
  are you aware of the levels of poverty , unemployment , and homelessness in greece , without even counting immigrants that arrive every day ? 
  very little of the picture your friend has painted is to be attributed to this recent wave of increased immigration . 
  yes , greece ca n't deal with them effectively , but it 's for reasons which have nothing to do with immigration . 
   they will bring middle east shit together with them . 
  you mean the us is going to want to bomb them to get their oil ? 
  damn that 's rough . 
   we do not want to exterminate them - we want not allow to let them in . 
  once they are in , though , it 's free for all , right ? 
   hope that you realise protests like that tends to attract many extremists . 
   hence the picture . 
  wonderful how causality works . 
  it does n't fix the problem unless the description is actually confirmed as fact . 
  which puts work onto _ you _ to verify stories . 
  i 'm 99 % sure you ( the mods ) ca n't do that , generally . 
  because they 're useless , unverifiable rants . 
  when it 's a fact the tweet links to the actual story . 
  ironically , that one country only did it after offering asylum to another country 's rocket scientists . . 
  come on , just wait 5 more days for the election to get with the gd fud . 
  yeah !, 
  in syria !, 
  yeah !, 
   i think the golden dawn is all that stands between lesbos and actual fighting . 
  that is disgusting . 
  what . 
  utter . 
  strong incentive not to fuck up training missions , i guess . 
  will try not to secure a non-aggression pact with the unstable neighbours next time , huh ? 
   `` principal agreement '' on further voluntary relocation of 120.000 people , but only to be properly voted on in october  glad to see this immigration issue is n't really as urgent as the media reports , eh fellas ? 
  wish i could , i 'm on mobile . 
  hopefully later . 
  well , for starters , it 's not an arbitrary decision , it 's a hypothesis backed by historical evidence . 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  the piece is literally employing every trick in the book to report on facts as neutrally as possible , and still you read into it whatever the hell is in your head . 
  it would n't surprise me if most posters here thought turkey to be akin to libya . 
  too bad for them . 
  i do n't see why anybody would care about what a troll wrote . 
  i do n't think we need to be the kind of organisation that labels people . 
  i was laughing at # 2 for 15 minutes straight . 
  oh no , here it comes again . . 
  canada follows eu law ? 
  well , alright then . 
  let 's have a brew . 
  that 's not how asylum works . 
  it 's a wsj article - oversimplification and rationalisation . 
  do n't expect any substance in it . 
  `` the middle east 's failure '' -- coming from a wsj article which is missing _ any _ references to the united states ' role in it . 
  the _ fucking _ nerve !, 
  i did not misread you . 
  i reinforced the point which is impacted most by capital controls , regardless if it were about `` taking money out of the country '' - which it is not , it 's about stopping the depletion of bank liquidity . 
  it 's ok to write '' $ 10 billion '' . 
  _ how the fuck is this +20 ? 
  you 're supposed to upvote contributions to discussion , you twats . _, 
   i love the french expressions for death itself like `` he 's eating dandelions from the root '' that 's curious , we have a similar expression in greek '' \u03b2\u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03c1\u03b1\u03b4\u03af\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1 \u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03b1 '' - `` he 's looking at dandelions from the root '' . 
  the complete stoppage of imports/exports is not a `` minor problem '' .

  `` everything '' ? 
  what parts of the recently agreed programme have been implemented ? 
  ( _ i know , but i 'm asking if / r/europe knows _ ), 
  no , a race is a competition . 
  it 's a bubble , specifically housing . 
  very worrisome indeed . 
  what source is this btw ( google translate did n't help ) ? 
   did n't sweden start muslim immigration around mid 70s ? 
   i was worried that at least one / r/europe submission today did n't have a racist angle . 
  for certain sectors ( e.g. 
  teachers ) , greece has it as well . 
  it 's a farcical mockery of unions ; they keep wages down and give power to union members to bargain extravagant benefits . 
  it did not . 
  remember the greek govt _ ignored _ said vote . 
  the eu was determined to help gr either way . 
  do you know for a fact each of the photographers that took those pictures was trying to accurately and representatively image the immigrant demographic ? 
  do you know the published image distribution corresponds to said pictures taken ? 
  do you know if , and how , the pictures were subsequently edited ? 
  does the order of appearance of the pictures elicit certain feelings in you ? 
  do n't claim to know so much about reality , when in fact you 're only seeing what you want to see . 
  your assumption is wrong . 
  i do n't know where you live , but most probably a republic . 
  in an alternate universe , we are at war with turkey already and bulgaria is inhabited exclusively by llamas ( with hats ) . 
   which is a huge problem . 
  intolerance is a problem ? 
  who knew !, 
   personally , forums like this serve as an oasis of conversation because people like me are afraid to publically voice opinions deemed politically incorrect . 
  guess what , if you hold an opinion somebody would fire you for , chances are it 's not a very popular one in general , except in a few `` oasis of conversation '' with people who share it . 
  you 're not deciding anything . 
  we 're holding elections in 10 days , that should tell you enough . 
  whether this sub is representative of anything but itself is irrelevant , really . 
  i for one , as a new subscriber here - i subscribed a bit before `` grexit '' was the flavour of the day - seem to run into the same misinformed or misinforming accounts , in every topic that 's brought up . 
  they frequently go on rants without any backing whatsoever , misappropriate sufficiently vague comments to fit their rhetoric , and generally acting like a + quality trolls . 
  why they 're still allowed to post , i do n't even know . 
  _ technically _ they could , but it 's infeasible in the scenario you imagine . 
  if you care to elaborate , there 's a myth we could dispel in there somewhere . 
  yes , yes . 
  you are guilt-free , and therefore responsibility-free . 
  allow the rest of us to ignore you while we try to help people in need . 
  i 'm not here to convince you . 
  look them up , or do n't .
