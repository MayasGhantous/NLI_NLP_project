  for too long trains have provided shelter and passage to criminals .

   this money is payed at the eu directly and from the eu , without the obligation to pay back . 
  again , they 're loans . 
  the only gain for gr ( or any receiver of such loans ) is the discrepancy between the present value of a loan and the future value at the time of maturity ( plus interest , of course ) . 
  nobody transfers money to the eu . 
  the ez is not a transfer union . 
  perhaps you are confused with the way ecb works , which is nothing like what you describe anyway . 
  i guess you 're referring to [ this ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=88 ) , right ?

  what is the right amount of seriousness , do you think ? 
  i think subsidies are ok , the method of distribution needs some more scrutiny , however . 
  what i mean by that is subsidies need to be allocated on a necessity basis rather than harvested area alone ( as was the case in the past , or still is in some countries ) . 
  of course , it is more difficult to ascertain necessity and need among farmers individually , but there still needs to be a sweet spot for the tradeoff between gains from eliminating corruption and spending to audit subsidised farmers . 
  literally _ anybody _ can be a politician . 
  now there 's an interesting article . 
  i like that people are considering food redistribution this way . 
  i wonder what kind of incentives this gives to supermarkets & bakeries . 
  greece should be '' \u03b8\u03b7\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc '' alone , '' \u03b6\u03ce\u03bf '' means ` animal ' .

  my girlfriend 's own popularity with me is n't 70 % , and she 's even giving me head regularly . 
  seriously now , i have no idea how politicians are able to polarise and fanaticise voters so much in gr . 
  it 's likely , but is there historical data to substantiate it ? 
  if i had to go lotr , i 'd go straight for `` mordor '' .

  attracting voters means an increase in the number of voters for a party , which i 'm pretty sure is nearly synonymous with growing . . maybe you wanted to argue that even though one votes for a nationalist party , he is not a nationalist , which would be a pretty fun read for a sunday . 
  so what you 're saying is it 's not ( skin colour ) discrimination , it 's ( religious ) discrimination . 
  albanians ( and serbs , croatians , bulgarians , romanians ) have integrated just fine , thank you . 
  the only problem is the first-rate assholes who think of them as second-class citizens . 
  ignorance hit an all time high . 
  once again , we will need to _ see _ the refugees filthy , dead , and abused before we uphold their human rights . 
  otherwise , we will systematically ignore them , just as we have done in the past .
