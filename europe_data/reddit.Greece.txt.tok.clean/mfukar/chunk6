   can you seriously not use your reasoning and logic skills to determine what is going on without a translation ? 
   in which / u/ganymede07011610 demonstrates words are unnecessary for comprehension . 
  do n't be offended by the pictures of drowned people being shared , be offended by people drowning . 
  how naive . 
  the qualities of us presidential candidates , and thus presidents , have sharply declined in number in the past few decades . 
  and of course everyone still clings to the `` right-left '' cliches . 
   most do , according to a documentary i saw , with literally millions in refugee camps in neighbouring countries . 
   [ literally millions ] ( http://www.infowars.com/in-just-4-years-half-of-syrian-population-of-22-million-has-been-killed-displaced-or-fled-the-country/ ), 
  nope . 
  honestly , georgia is giving me trouble in my eu4 game right now . 
  that 's all , sorry . 
  housing bubble finally bursts , your tech sector shrinks , ... , profit ? 
  as you undoubtedly have already noticed , trolls_brigade is a troll who just constantly moves the goalposts . 
  they do n't like to admit any mistakes . 
  pmi is not comparable across countries . 
  that 's where your second mistake lies . 
  i do n't subscribe to the idea of 'em inent domain ' . 
  yes , there are minefields . 
  at least greek authorities buried 25k antipersonnel and antitank mines there after turkey invaded cyprus . 
  ( [ source ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/06/world/europe/06iht-mines.4.19133102.html ) , which also lists casualties in the minefields ) . 
  when you have a housing bubble the size of ireland , the difference is quite obvious . 
  you are completely ignoring the time series . 
  when a scalar is at a `` n-month low/high '' , it means that 's the lowest/highest value seen in that `` n-month '' series . 
  thus , germany hit a 16-month high with its manufacturing pmi , meaning it 's enjoying a steadily increasing growth , while netherlands , italy , and ireland [ 's growth rates ] are decreasing . 
  the `` growth cooling '' , as some analyst has put it , is a euphemism for things going downhill for the three countries you mention , especially after just yesterday having announced inflation of only 0.2 % . 
  actually , it 's fenced from both sides , with armed sentries and constant patrols from both sides , and a pretty wide exposed area in the middle in which there is mostly no cover or hiding spots . 
  sea routes are a no-brainer . 
  these rankings are n't opinion polls . 
  my money 's on `` no '' . 
   what we have here is a huge amount of wasted productivity/free time , and chances of success that depend a lot on family wealth . 
  no argument there 's a lot of resources wasted - it 's easy to throw resources at the wrong problem . 
  your friend may well be the exception , rather than the rule . 
  he 's found motivation where you have n't . 
  school is supposed to provide that motivation , but has n't , or does n't for a lot of students - that 's the most significant shortcoming of schools in gr , imo . 
  competition is a fact of life , and competition inside school does n't even come close to the competition you 're going to face outside of it . 
  i think there 's no downside to schools introducing competition , as long as it 's kept in check and does not become a goal in itself . 
  the frequency and subject matter for each test ( or exam ) matters . 
  exams are usually thought of as taken once ( end of the year ) , and their subject matter can be any topic discussed in class ( but not all , due to time & space limitations ) . 
  tests taken throughout the school year can test the entirety of the material , but have other shortcomings . 
  i doubt there 's a single best option here . 
  best of luck . 
  i bet the same can be said about some other word which was `` just another word for black people '' for the afrikaner . 
  but it is irrelevant . 
   but health care and gun laws have no effect outside of the us . 
  they are purely domestic issues . 
  if a couple ten thousand people get shot or die with treatable cancer it does n't effect us the slightest . 
  that 's not true . 
  every week there 's a mass shooting in the us , the rest of the world promptly mocks them for still having to endure one . 
  a reminder we 're still relatively sane , if you know what i mean . 
  no , i think immigrants will be used as a scapegoat and an opportunity to launch several conflicting geopolitical agendas , some short-sighted ( e.g. 
  hungary ) , and some not . 
  as if anybody was flying ba anyway . 
  [ [ story ] ( http://news.yahoo.com/hungarian-train-300-400-migrants-stopped-austrian-border-130714369.html ) ], 
  depends on the field . 
  ethz is pretty much uncontested in cs , for example . 
  any place !, 
   however when local women and children were shipped to western europe as sex slaves no one batted an eye . 
  why the past tense ? 
  coerced prostitution is still very common in the eu . 
  i said debatable , not impossible . 
  turkey !, 
  greece !, 
  excitement !, 
   anyone can discuss europe . 
  meaningfully ? 
  that 's debatable . 
  holy shit , i do n't think there 's a combination of words in your comment that does n't form some sort of a stereotype . 
  did you even read the legend ? 
  your comments are changing the topic after two responses . 
  if we could get back to the discussion , that 'd be great . 
  i know , even finns have n't been able to found a company half as successful as nokia yet . 
  all sane people see the problem with invading a country . 
   till on is on top of reddit published by forbes with impressive visibility around the world . 
  while this would be downvoted and claimed as `` russian propagandists are scrambling to mobilize their shills to try to hide their mistakes . '', 
  there 's nothing i can do about that . 
  i could write 500 comments and blogposts pointing out that both articles do n't provide evidence , and i would n't reach more than 10 people anyway . 
  at least i can preserve my own sanity . 
  go troll somewhere else . 
  polls do n't give them more than 6 % ( or 7 , i could be mistaken ) currently . 
  they 'll work with anybody who gives them a place in a coalition government , which is the scary part , mostly because it 's all the same corrupt motherfuckers getting more than 15 % , and they wo n't bat an eye to cooperating with gd if it gets them into power ( nd said as much , i bet it 's on everyone else 's mind too ) . 
  slippery slope from that point . 
  however , gr is in no place to be anything like a nazi germany at all . 
  yeah . 
  probably everywhere else except finland . 
  be useful . 
  i think we should be worried . 
  i think we should be worried we 're not doing enough for those people , and i think we should be worried we 're going to use them to fuel irrelevant geopolitical agendas . 
  both are on the same page with me : they 're trash . 
  because i refuse to accept anecdotes ? 
  or because there are multiple `` anatoly kravchenko '' ? 
  providing accurate information is what debunking is about , but nothing about the claims the article makes are `` self-explanatory '' . 
  it 's not a `` horrible '' normalisation . 
  it 's the part of the article op presented to you without mentioning it 's the `` per population '' statistic . 
  the [ article ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/08/28/world/europe/countries-under-strain-from-european-migration-crisis.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0 ) provides both . 
  first hand anecdotes are not sources . 
  i thought nazi symbols are n't illegal in finland . 
  when will the finns get below 5 % in polls ? 
  do n't you think that at some point all these `` some dude `` s become something more ? 
  something that maybe we should be worried about , given our track record with fucking stupid wars over nationalism ? 
  your country 's lack of infrastructure does n't make the numbers bigger , only its response smaller .
