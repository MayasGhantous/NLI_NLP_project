  nice , france . 
  went there for the first time when i was about 20 , totally fell in love with it , it 's like a second home to me . 
  deportations to greece only stopped a few months ago - you can find that story on asylumineurope , too . 
  freedom of expression via piss ? 
   who kills himself over some stupid bitches probably somebody with a less myopic view of a serious situation , involving people more than sexist stereotypes . 
  i 'm aware of it . 
  i have , in fact , worked for it as a contractor a few times since 2011 when it was assembled ( not as part of their mission , for those that wonder ) . 
  as of last year , they were ( still ) not fully staffed and had limited experience , while at the same time have difficulty collecting ( only 58 out of 231 mil in fines & additional taxes ) , 50 % less than estimated by the state & troika . 
  [ [ story ] ( http://www.capital.gr/story/2189713/posous-strimoxe-to-elliniko-irs ) ], 
  oh you need it spelt out . 
  ok , 1 ) i do n't concern myself with the question whether mods display `` agenda pushing '' 2 ) i have no idea whether they display `` consistent poor judgement '' 3 ) the above expressions are quoted because they 're not my words 4 ) i do n't care who gets to be on the mod team , only that trash submissions do n't make their way to my screen 5 ) are we done here ? 
  logical leap world champion , right here . 
  poor judgement . 
  of course it is , i 'm just pointing out there are more obstacles along the way . 
  `` visa exemptions '' is actually the relevant section . 
  i thought you were pointing out that one group was accusing another of not standing by their `` ideology '' ( non-sarcastically ) , which is of course standard practice when trying to make politicians look inconsistent . 
  no , people have just been pointing out to you two things : a ) the terminology as you know it does not apply where you think it does , and b ) the terminology is so vague as to be meaningless, 
  it was written for its writer . 
  their staff is still [ highly incompetent ] ( http://www.kathimerini.gr/827666/opinion/epikairothta/politikh/oi-foro-kloyzo-ths-skyroy ) . 
  they do n't have any incentive to properly do their job . 
  there 's a huge conflict of interest when the [ state itself is evading taxes ] ( http://www.e-typos.com/gr/politismos/article/143044/i-tameiaki-mihani-stin-knosso-itan-adiloti/ ) . 
  what does this mean ? 
  it means sdoe is picking on the low hanging fruit , and is still unable to do their job , just like they always have been . 
  at some point , reforms will have to include not only attempts to ensure reliable statistics , but also reliable audit structures . 
  reserved ? 
  no sir . 
  you have the filthiest mouths i 've ever heard . 
  [ source : worked for finnish company ], 
  maybe you do . 
   strong boarder security to turn the boats back get it through your thick heads , eu legislation does not allow countries to do that . 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ know, 
  proof ? 
  he was arrested on `` attempting '' , ergo prosecution ca n't prove anything . 
   we 're propping up dictators and warlords ? 
  which ones ? 
  as far as i can tell , we 've been trying to promote democracy . 
  you 're projecting . 
  a good portion of europeans are fine with immigration . 
  that 's because czech universities are generally meh . 
  [ source : heeact , leiden ], 
  totally immune to increased immigration , political instability , you-name-it , proving the only thing that actually matters is pricing . 
  translation :  head of the `` indignant citizens '' in kos a serving police officer with long service in nis , kotsiopoulos stavros , along with neo-nazis ... 
  same as everywhere else , which is how we 've grouped them under the term `` tabloids '' ? 
  i 'm sorry , i know it 's not a very interesting answer . 
  tabloids are n't !, 
  another instance in the pile of proof that increased surveillance ca n't be converted to actionable information by incompetent `` intelligence services '' . 
  thank you , please share more about ` people like me ' , from your pedestal of superiority . 
  that self loathing is either greek or catholic . 
  almost all positive , from / r/eyebleach stuff to `` fuck yeah neighbour '' . 
  votes . 
  easy question , what 's the next one ? 
  they are probably only considering _ local _ demand , which is of course steadily decreasing . 
  wages are also going down , instead of up . 
  at this point , i 'm imagining you guys fondling and stroking each other 's hands . 
  increased diversity in our societies , leading to less racial stereotyping as they integrate . 
  this has been the case with greece over the past 25 years , and i 'm confident it 'll be the same abroad too . 
  obviously , we 'll have to throw some cash at the racists and conspiracy theorists to shut them up while they die off , but i 'm fairly confident the transformation of the eu in a transfer union will take care of that . 
  being biased is a good reason . 
  they are similar in pronunciation , and a fair bit of mutual lexicon ( including , funnily enough , `` l\u00e9xico '' ) . 
  joke 's on you , i got a us naval base nearby . 
  maybe he has a broken everything . 
  no no , clearly we need us marines deployed everywhere . 
  calm down , donald rumsfeld . 
  relevant username . 
  let me get this straight , now you move the goalpost by dismissing the experts , because their consensus is not prevalent on the websites you frequent ? 
  you have n't even read the books !, 
  you do n't even know what they 're talking about !, 
  one of them could ( is , in fact ) quoting several other experts and forming a consensus , but your lazy ass pseudo-intellectualism prefers to type nonsense .

  do n't deflect . 
  we 're addressing a very specific claim of his , `` wherever a lessening of population pressures through reduced birth rates can increase the prospects for such stability , population policy becomes relevant to resource supplies and to the economic interests of the united states . '' . 
  we addressed it with , wtf . 
   the fact is , scholars are debating well , if one random comment appeals to `` scholars '' , it must be telling the truth . 
  in your own words , there is no factual basis for claiming islam is a religion of hate and aggression . 
  this is a common misconception based on the distortion of the religious message by fundamentalists post 9/11 , which is now considered `` mainstream '' . 
  in fact , fundamentalism is actually _ bad _ .
