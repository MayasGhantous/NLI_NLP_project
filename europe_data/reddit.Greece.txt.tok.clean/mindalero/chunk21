  i hope one day it will look like that, 
   historical reason which are ? 
  a big part of our history is with us being in conflict with our neighbors , like the balkan wars fought against the ottomans and later the bulgarians , the civil war when slavic macedonians fought alongside with the communists and many were expelled etc. 
   however , you know what does ? 
  your geographic situation . 
  and then you say  if greece was like . . say , belgium - then yea , i would understand . 
  that does n't make sense buddy . 
  decide . 
   again , this is simply stupid . 
  you are balkanic because you are positioned in the balkans . 
  that 's what it fucking means . 
  and not only that , culturally and genetically as well . 
  you are balkanic through and through we ** do n't ** consider ourselves balkanic , and no , we 're not balkanic `` through and through '' , that usually is said for bulgaria , romania etc. 
  no matter how hard you try , we 're not balkanic and geography means nothing when we are rarely mentioned as balkanic . 
  lol i 'm going to delete my comment because you 're so stupid that you think that i implied that committing genocide is a kind of strength . 
  i mean the majority of you turks deny the genocides you committed . 
  that 's what i implied , that you are fucking brainwashed, 
  first of all give me a source so i can see what happened before that . 
  second , unlike serbs who were vassals , greeks always sided with the venetians against the turks to defend crete and morea . 
  study about the venetian rule of southern greece and the islands and stop cherry picking novi pazar has still majority muslim serbs afaik , at least you did n't genocided them, 
   still believes that greeks are the super master race of the universe . 
  when did i say something like that ? 
  you are a proof that education in turkey has n't changed much in the last 500 years, 
   hungarians attacked the ottoman empire to try to take lands from them and serbian vassals assisted the ottoman empire . 
  vassal states are nothing unheard of if you know anything about history then do n't say that the serbs fought the ottomans for 500 centuries you dumbass, 
  if anyone is in denial , it 's some turks here who are desperate to appear more european . 
  identity crisis much ? 
  turks were kicked out of here centuries ago dude , but some stayed tbh , they 're muslim though, 
   and yes serbs did fight the ottomans for 500 years serbs even helped the ottomans attack hungary , but you are wrong anyway, 
  correct , i got confused , i mean far right, 
  i just edited my comment . 
  i mean ** far ** right , so my mistake , sorry for the confusion, 
  how ? 
   but you 're just trying to make us closer to you kurds . 
  but you are closer to kurds . 
  why do n't you just accept it ? 
  wrong . 
  this was just a history fact . 
  i was n't `` crying '' about anything . 
  it was a serb user who claimed that serbs fought the ottomans for 500 years therefore i corrected him . 
  also no one `` forcibly '' participates in such battles, 
   most right wing parties are considered right wing because of their free market policies . 
  their social views can be totally liberal . 
  i think that depends on the country , in greece when we think of far right parties we think of racists , religious fanatics etc. 
  so in my opinion it depends on the country, 
   look down on the balkans ? 
  do n't belong in the balkans ? 
  why ? 
  because of historical reasons , what can you not understand ? 
  i was being clear in my comment  it 's not like greece is a oasis of prosperity surrounded by the filth of the balkans . 
  i never said that , our economic situation has nothing to do with us being balkan or not  sorry to disappoint you , but greece fits right in . 
   you 're only going to disappoint yourself when you find out that we do n't consider ourselves balkanic , so there 's no reason for you to try to put us there, 
  the reason my comment was removed is because i posted a link that was under constant review ( ? ) . 
  it was automatically removed , no mod removed it, 
  what high horse ? 
  i 'm not bragging , that 's the reality in greece, 
  that situation is like when you have black people supporting trump . 
  therefore that means that the certain party is n't about race , but being anti-eu , anti-muslim etc. 
  i could be wrong though . 
  tbh i do find it weird that a black man would be a candidate for a right wing party , considering that these kind of parties attract countless of racists, 
  serbian nationalism and greek nationalism ( like golden dawn ) are kinda tied unfortunately . 
  i can recommend you a good article but it 's in greek . 
  most greeks do n't view any balkan country as close to us tbh in my opinion , it 's mostly nationalism , but a big reason that they consider us as `` friends '' , is because our government did n't participate in the campaign against serbia in 1999 ( we kinda did participate through military bases though ) . 
  also because unfortunately our government does n't recognize kosovo . 
  he was a pontian born in greece , he came from odessa probably, 
  i guess condom strong, 
  i know about the volunteers , it was golden dawn . 
  around 100 people . 
  you mean forums like reddit ? 
  yeah , `` patterns '' . 
  next thing you 're gon na tell me is that it 's a conspiracy theory . 
  it 's so obvious but you 're still refusing the truth, 
   these results are completely your fault . 
  i agree . 
  my comment was n't meant for greece . 
  there is a clear distinction between the areas ruled by the ottoman empire and the rest of europe, 
  the shitty ottoman empire can be blamed for a lot of things . 
  as we can see from the eastern side of europe , ottomanism is still alive and going in a particular country, 
  understood , thanks for the explanation, 
  i guess i overestimated right ? 
  in greece there was this story that there are maps of great macedonia in your classrooms , like [ this ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qkcvz46za9s/tuotdbjefji/aaaaaaaar1c/38cguguqbc0/s1600/%25ce%25a3%25ce%259a%25ce%259f%25ce%25a0%25ce%2599%25ce%2591....png ) , that 's why i said that, 
  the only issue i have with fyrom/slavic macedonia is that it seems that many of them believe in a `` great macedonia '' which includes almost all northern greece . 
  that 's probably their politicians fault . 
  the name dispute is very stupid if you ask me and both sides are to blame . 
   which is to some extent even worse . 
  i 'd certainly rank croatia , for instance , as more functioning , less corrupt and less violent than , say , sicily or calabria . 
  i did n't meant sicily but calabria as you said , campania , apulia etc. 
  it is n't a matter of economic situation or something like that , it 's simply that we feel closer to them than any other country . 
  generally , italy , spain and portugal have a good reputation here and are the countries we feel closer to, 
   i contacted him after an albanian user accused me of being him , he said you guys were trolls lol , and wo n't tell me what he did . 
  you 're such a liar dude , this is fucking ridiculous . 
  you were banned and created an alt , it 's so obvious . 
  was he banned ? 
  that explains it all , that dude was a ridiculous troll , i 'm 100 % convinced that this is his alt-account . 
  i understand your point , i have n't been to neighboring countries to try food but i agree that byzantine history played an important role . 
  still , culturally we do n't view ourselves part of the balkans , especially the islands . 
  i think south italy is closer to us than any neighboring country, 
  i do n't think so , greek islanders are not balkan at all and greek mainlanders and generally greeks mostly look down on the balkans ( it 's not like we 're in a far better situation , mostly historical reasons ) . 
  most greeks do n't feel they belong in the balkans , me included, 
  i think other greek users can answer this question way better but i 'll try .
