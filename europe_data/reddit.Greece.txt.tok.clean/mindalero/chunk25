  it is one of the first things you learn when you study ottoman history but i admit i 'm not an expert in the ottomans  and for siege of constantinople , that is one of the rare times we `` sided '' with them and that 's only because we recently got conquered by them and were forced into submission . 
  our ruler had no chance because if he had n't sent the help of 1500 soldiers they 'd massacre us . 
  i 'm not judging the serb decision to side with them . 
  you sided with them , end of story . 
  but do n't brag that you fought against them at the same time  out of all balkan people serbs are ** definitely ** the ones that had the most uprisings and wars against the ottomans , so you saying what you did is kind of offensive . 
  we do n't know the exact number of rebellions dude . 
  i can say with the same ease that greeks were the ones who started the most rebellions . 
   the boys were of all christian ethnicities , so janissaries were equally greek , bulgarian , romanian and serbian , while bosniaks/albanians were spared because they changed their religion . 
  i said that most were slavic , nothing special . 
  slavic peoples were the most numerous people of the ottoman balkans , so it 's accurate to say that most devshirme individuals were of serb origin, 
  the pope sent help anyway , along with the venetians , the genoese and the kingdom of sicily . 
  the byzantines invited them . 
  serbs were fighting along with the ottoman invaders , why is it so hard to accept that you were their allies ? 
  many serb redditors think that whoever disagrees with them is either albanian/croat/bosniak or is simply a troll . 
  i have been called an albanian by ** 4 ** different serb users . 
  you are the trolls, 
  there were even 2-3 dutch pirates who rose under the ottomans . 
  we 're not discussing that . 
  the dude said that serbs were fighting the turks for 4-5 centuries which is a lie . 
  in the beginning serbs were allies to the ottomans, 
  the only part that i 'm not sure about is whether serbs were the largest part of the janissaries . 
  slavic people were definitely the larger though , that 's where you get all those slavic looking turks today from :p i 'm not trolling or whatever . 
  these are facts , you can do your own research, 
  well , tbh serbs were very loyal to the ottomans , most janissaries were either of serb or bosniak descent , serbs were even with the ottoman side during the siege of constantinople , so no , you did n't `` fought them for 4-5 centuries '' . 
  you were loyal to them , regardless if serbs eventually had enough and revolted . 
  that 's actually true , kosovars were oppressed and wanted independence which they rightfully got , now i 'm not saying that they were angels , uck did some bad stuff but that does n't change the fact that serbs treated kosovars like shit and actually committed worst atrocities . 
  republika srpska is a state created through ethnic cleansing of innocent people . 
  there 's an interesting thing in what you said . 
  serbs call russians their `` orthodox brothers '' but when russia invades orthodox majority countries like ukraine and georgia serbs support russia as always lol, 
  okay maybe i put a lot of effort on my claim but i 'm sure that a big reason that the serbia-croatia relations were always bad is because religion, 
  yes but croatia and serbia are two of the most religious countries in europe, 
  it 's religion that fucked things up . 
  look at croats and serbs , it 's like 50 % of the reason they hate each other is because one is catholic and the other is orthodox . 
  swiss tourists are very friendly . 
  also switzerland has beautiful towns and cities, 
  i do . 
  but yeah it does n't reach it 's full potential on the photo, 
  seriously i ca n't remember the name of the book , maybe i 'm wrong but i remember that some byzantine emperor had a very similar title, 
   there are no german ambassadors in this period i meant the ambassador of the holy roman empire , not so much difference . 
   you claimed that `` the last byzantine emperors called themselves `` emperor of romans and greeks '' '' but i suppose your little google search did n't give you that ? 
  i learned that from a greek history book tbh, 
  definitely hehe the italians were the only ones who helped us defend the city, 
   this does n't sound right is that one of the pretenders after the fourth crusade ? 
  maybe you are confusing one of them with mehmed ii . 
  `` basileus and autokrator of the romans '' is the standart . 
  they were sometimes referred to as `` basileius of the graikoi '' and sometimes even directly ( as frederick ii did ) . 
  though they did referred to themselves as ruler of such and such in diplomatic relations but that is not confined to greeks . 
  the latins referred to the inhabitants of greece as `` greeks '' not `` romans '' , the reason was because they saw themselves as inheritors of the roman empire . 
  the german ambassador to the byzantines referred to the emperor of the byzantine empire as the `` king of greeks '' ( even though that emperor was n't greek himself probably ) . 
  you can easily find all this with a quick google search , the fact that non-greeks referred to us as `` greeks '' is very important . 
   this does n't make constantinople a greek city though it was a multicultural city but greek was the official language of the empire . 
  also greeks were the majority of the city , regardless if the emperors identified as romans . 
  the byzantine empire is tied with greece and only , again , regardless if most emperors identified as romans . 
  the last dynasties were greek anyway, 
  i used to think the same , but there was a greek identity in the byzantine years . 
  the aristocracy of constantinople called themselves `` romans '' but there was a greek identity inside greece . 
  the last byzantine emperors called themselves `` emperor of romans and greeks '' or something like that, 
  lol there are estimates of 300.000 muslims in greece , mainly in the north , turks , pomaks and romanis . 
  btw we kicked out invaders , that happens in revolutions . 
  for the record , we might like the french a lot but many greeks were supporting portugal because we love santos and you are a country we identified through the tournament , you know , boring football but in the end you won . 
  this guy is seen like a god in greece . 
  rightfully so, 
  who 's helping us take it back ? 
  we 'll loot it so much that our debt will be erased 3 times :d, 
  very nice !, 
  thanks for the info , it 's nice that greeks got along well with the locals, 
  afaik there was a significant greek minority there, 
  the reason it 's so beautiful is because it did n't fell into ottoman hands, 
  i did n't expect him on r/europe :d, 
  til, 
  lmao is that joachim l\u00f6w on the left ? 
  he looks like fikret abdic, 
  tbh the brothers were greeks, 
  that 's another theory , afaik hitler 's and ustashe theory was that croats were gothic, 
  how he allied with bulgaria then ? 
  he had an aryan theory for all his allies , but calling the bulgarians `` mongols '' and `` turks '' does n't sound aryan edit : slavomacedonians calling you `` tatari '' is ridiculous lol . 
  they are genetically very close to you so it does n't make sense, 
  i think i read on wikipedia that they converted like hundreds of thousands but it 's possibly an exaggeration, 
  wow is that marko perkovic singing ? 
  has n't he denied these allegations ? 
  if it 's him , how did they got away with that ? 
  thanks for the info, 
  are thompson considered fascist ? 
  they have patriotic songs but i do n't think people see them as fascists, 
  what happened to the hundred thousands of serbs who were forced to convert to catholicism ? 
  are they croats now or did they convert back to orthodoxy ? 
  thanks for the replies guys, 
  i know , but as we all know hitler had weird racial theories and he used them accordingly , so according to hitler and pavelic the croats were not of slavic descent but of gothic ( germanic ), 
  question : is it true that most yugoslav partisans were croats ? 
  unfortunately moderate muslims have to pay because radical muslims are always on the news . 
  it 's unfair, 
   generally speaking : armenians , turks , greeks and even persians to a certain degree ( extending to kurds and azeris ) are closely related , which is n't a surprise considering all these populations have lived under the sphere of roman/byzantine/greek / ottoman/persian rule + control or close contact with throughout history . 
  not true , first of all living in the same empire does n't mean panmixia , especially during ottoman times . 
  i agree that a significant number of anatolian and pontian greeks are closer to these peoples you posted but greeks cluster close with italians and iberians , there are some good maps about european genetics around but of course we ca n't always be sure about their credibility . 
  tbh you 're kinda right , it 's a bridge that unites europe with asia so it 's actually significant, 
  bad shit is bad shit though , i do n't hate nor give a shit about turkey , i simply said that this post is 50 % in asia which it is , that does n't make me hate turkey, 
   many turks have anatolian ancestry well they 're an anatolian people , the genetic makeup of the native anatolian people has n't changed much throughout the centuries  and are not too different from greeks as well they may not be that different from some anatolian greeks who came here during the population exchange but they 're definitely different to ethnic greeks  turkey almost has the same amount of central asian genetic markers as their neighbors in armenia or iran . 
  i disagree , central asian dna on turks is like 10 %, 
  have n't seen a post depicting a landscape from cyprus on this sub . 
  wtf ?
