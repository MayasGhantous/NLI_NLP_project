  tha ` ts actually because people do n't know the truth , or they just do n't like it . 
  i could easily say the same thing for spain , but i do n't want to start a stupid convesation on the internet.btw spain is really such a wonderful country . 
  i commented here when there were like 3 comments.anyway , there are some albanian people who claim they have greek roots in order to gain greek citizenship in order to immigrate easily to greece and european countries.oh , and btw i am not racist , my best friends are albanian . 
  well , i didnt understand that , was this humourous or something?lol sorry but im not fun at parties . 
  for the `` some people claiming to have greek roots because they want to receive greek nationality '' part.i wanted to make clear that i dont have a problem with albanian people . 
  it depends on the occasion . 
  greece and albania are not switching people.read my comment if you have time please , 
  well im greek but , there are no greek minorities in albania , only some few people in the southern part.there are just some people claiming to have greek roots because they want to receive greek nationality , and immigrate easier to greece or other places around the european union.btw im not racist , my best friends are albanian actually . 
  i 'm not saying that it did n't happen , it did . 
  i 'm saying that it was n't a conquest of south italy , but of a south italian city . 
  that was n't a conquest of south italy , it was a conquest of a south italian city . 
  also , the ottoman occupation of that city lasted for 1 year . 
  ` briefly ' ? 
  when ? 
  ca n't you read properly ? 
   although , he only talks about intermarriage between muslims and christians not turks and greeks well , the greeks were christians and the turks were muslim . 
   and even states that the former was possible if it was a muslim man marrying a christian woman . 
  yes , but their child would be a muslim . 
   also , do you have anything more recent than 1916 ? 
  this does n't exactly seem to be cutting edge scholarship . 
  [ this is another source about the subject ] ( https://books.google.gr/books?id=byetwdb0ekec&amp;pg=pa200&amp;lpg=pa200&amp;dq=marriage+between+christian+and+muslims+in+the+ottoman+empire&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zh4ivt3zzf&amp;sig=fy9pnpqhrjf-0g5oxzhwzxemca0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjkwmrs85ztahvjwxqkhdtackgq6aeikdaj ) . 
   intermarriage was like wildfire in ottoman empire provide a source for that . 
  i did , and you 're wrong . 
  intermarriages were prohibited . 
   that 's why you ca n't tell the difference between greeks and turks nice troll attempt . 
  greeks and turks look nothing alike and that 's because they share completely different genetics . 
  in greek it 's pronounced ` yermaneea ', 
   greece was rich as fuck even though they 've been with us for centuries , for example . 
  greece was n't ` with you for centuries ' . 
  [ here ] ( https://books.google.gr/books?id=lqiaaaaaqbaj&amp;pg=pa78&amp;lpg=pa78&amp;dq=intermarriage%c2%a0in%c2%a0the%c2%a0ottoman+empire&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ztu4lkpv1p&amp;sig=suf6wmoodzsqanbpjk-0j6ve3lg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewibrtxzm5rtahwg2bokhcfodxoq6aeikdaj ), 
  and how you 're so sure that it was n't effective back then ? 
   who claim they only now have black hair because of centuries of turkish influence . 
  that 's a very stupid claim . 
  intermarriage was prohibited in the ottoman empire . 
   it says it in the first sentence right there but i was fully aware of this before even seeing this , surprised you did n't know . 
  all christian churches come from outside of europe , the first christian country was armenia . 
  the greek church looks different to both the catholic church and the mosque . 
  also , [ this ] ( http://www.stmaryshorsham.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/st.-marys-church-east-img_0001.jpg ) has a completely different architecture style than [ this ] ( http://previews.123rf.com/images/sergdibrova/sergdibrova1310/sergdibrova131000002/23043684-cathedral-of-saint-minas-orthodox-church-in-heraklion-crete--stock-photo.jpg ) . 
  there are catholic churches who look like [ this ] ( http://www.sizemoregroup.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/catholic-church-of-st.jpg ) . 
   it 's because orthodox churches but especially greek churches originated in the middle eastern region . 
  since when did greek churches originated in the middle eastern region ? 
   thus they are kind of like brothers . 
  what ? 
  that does n't make sense . 
   greek churches while they are christian have more architectural relations with mosques than they do with other european christian churches . 
  that 's not true at all . 
  take a look at these churches : [ in athens ] ( http://l7.alamy.com/zooms/f4893220405b4dfcaee1a34e648c89f6/greek-orthodox-church-athens-greece-churches-bdmkmn.jpg ) [ in thessaloniki ] ( http://www.ellestate.gr/images/uploaded_images/01_exxthessaloniki_1144937k_1467109152.jpg ) [ in heraklion ] ( http://previews.123rf.com/images/sergdibrova/sergdibrova1310/sergdibrova131000002/23043684-cathedral-of-saint-minas-orthodox-church-in-heraklion-crete--stock-photo.jpg ), 
  when you say ` nationalists ' , what kind of nationalists do you mean ? 
  kemalists are nationalists too . 
  grey wolves as well but i guess they like him . 
   who hate erdogan such as kemalists and ** nationalists ** since when do nationalists in turkey hate erdogan ? 
  it 's the complete opposite . 
  during yugoslavia the bosniaks were called ` muslims ' . 
  how are we ` aggressive ' and ` rude ' ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
   we mixed blood what are you talking about ? 
  intermarriage was prohibited in the ottoman empire . 
   culture not true , greek and turkish cultures are very different from each other . 
   food , song , dance . 
  the anatolian refugees that came to greece from the population exchange brought here some anatolian dishes , instruments and songs , yes . 
  but still , things are very different in greece and turkey . 
  for example , turkish cuisine is very exotic . 
  greek cuisine is not . 
   we are intertwined for eternity whether you like it or not . 
  you seem to be obsessed with being associated with greeks . 
  why ? 
   half of the demographics are made up of anatolians , greeks , caucausians and slavs . 
  true , except for the ` greeks ' part . 
   italians are not european either . 
  you are north african stock that 's bullshit . 
   why do you think your hair is dark ? 
  dude , are you serious ? 
  dark hair are common in southern europe , simple as that . 
  nice !, 
  this could easily be a picture from greece too . 
  you should learn to use / s, 
  why is it in french though ? 
  [ here 's the wiki article for more information about the vergina sun ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/vergina_sun ), 
  yeah , their flag is a rip-off of the vergina sun , an ancient greek symbol . 
   i 'm from romania . 
  so you 're balkan and as i said , you should look at your own country first before talking about others . 
  also , point me where in the article does it mention that the lmu collapsed because of greece . 
  because that 's what you claimed . 
  it mentions that greece caused a problem to the union , though . 
  edit : and of course , he has n't answered . 
  what i meant is that anatolian genetics are more prominent in turks . 
  of course there are some who descend from turkic peoples or bosniaks , bulgarians etc. 
  2 neighbors and childhood friends of mine were half ukrainian big country ukrainians seem to have a good relationship with croats, 
  what am i ? 
  stop talking like a 10 year old . 
  how am i ` spreading hate ' ? 
  please elaborate . 
  it was actually obvious that you were trolling :d, 
  what are you talking about ? 
  our cultures are not similar at all . 
   but the west coast and around istanbul was absolutely predominantly greek . 
  no , they were n't predominantly greek and besides that , the greeks eventually left from there . 
   in my mind and heart greeks and turks will always be the two closest nations culturally ( even genetically ) . 
  not true . 
  greece and turkey are neither culturally nor genetically close .
