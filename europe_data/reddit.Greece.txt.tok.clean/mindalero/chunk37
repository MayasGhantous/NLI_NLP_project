  greece is geographically balkan if we exclude the islands , i agree . 
   after ancient greece , there was the byzantine empire - does that count as your heritage as well ? 
  i thought it does . 
  so , this empire and rome divided the rest of the balkans in their spheres of influence , military/economy/religion / culture . 
  some of us leaned towards rome , others towards constantinople . 
  then , you all had the misfortune of being occupied by ottomans ( unlike some of the rest ) for a long time , that left a mark . 
   so saying that you ca n't be culturally grouped with central and eastern balkan which modeled so much of itself * on your example * , or shared so much of the circumstances with you , is weird at best . 
  i would n't say that the balkans have greek influence because that influence is old and it 's mainly in religion imo ( orthodoxy ) . 
  and even orthodoxy can be modeled as ` eastern roman ' and not ` greek ' . 
  besides religion , it 's the cyrillic alphabet of course but that 's used even in mongolia . 
  similarly , i would n't say that greece is the same as her neighbors because that is not correct , ** but from what i 've noticed balkan people do it all the time ** . 
  since i do n't see greeks claiming that the balkans have greek influence , i do n't really like seeing balkan people claiming that `` greece is the center of the balkans '' . 
  oh , and i 've never seen a balkanite claiming that their country has greek influence . 
  everyone has to be ` balkan ' according to them . 
  i personally think that croatia is different than its balkan neighbors . 
  the architecture , which is a very important aspect , gives a completely different vibe . 
  imo croatia is both similar and different to the balkans . 
  and then you have the historical and political central european influence etc. 
  greece is geographically part of the balkans , but we have our own culture . 
  it was always like that . 
  i 'm tired of seeing balkan people getting butthurt that greece is not considered a part of the balkans . 
  there have to be some reasons for it , no ? 
  greece is considered western europe in the political sense . 
  greece is southern european , it 's just that butthurt balkanians like him want to put greece into the balkans . 
  and it is very ironic to say that greeks consider serbs to be the closest to them while ignoring bulgarians and fyromians who are literally the same people as serbs , out of bias . 
  only nationalists in greece have a thing for serbia . 
   greece is almost never considered a part of , despite being literally the center of the balkan peninsula , and sharing almost the same culture , lifestyle , even cuisine with its balkan ( and turkish , inb4 hellenic butthurt ) neighbors . 
  1 ) greece is certainly not the center of the ballot peninsula . 
  2 ) greece has a different culture than the balkans and turkey . 
  greek cuisine is varied and similarities with turkish come from the fact that after the [ population exchange ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/population_exchange_between_greece_and_turkey ) with turkey , greece received greek refugees from turkey who brought turkish foods with them . 
  that 's it . 
  why are balkan people so obsessed with greece ? 
  we are different , stop trying to lump us in the balkans by claiming outrageous things such as `` greece is the center of the balkan '' . 
   how is the orthodox nation more western than the catholic and protestant nations labeled as eastern europe by many ? 
  what has orthodoxy have to do with being western ? 
  let 's get real , greece is more western than every single post-communist country . 
   that 's very interesting , considering that as the core of orthodox christianity , greece is pretty much an epitome of an eastern european country . 
  uhm , no ? 
  orthodoxy started from greece , a south european country , so it 's more southern than eastern . 
  greece being orthodox does n't make us eastern european . 
  op made it sound like there are greeks in turkey . 
  it should be edited . 
  greeks living in the aegean coast of turkey ? 
  never heard of this . 
  the map is correct , greece is south european . 
  no changes need to be made . 
   it 's not my intention to claim that greece is very different from others ( because it is n't ) but rather questioning which special points connect these countries or is simply an arbitrary geographic division . 
  when it comes to greece and portugal the similarities stem mostly from the southern european outlook on life . 
  other things are different of course , both countries took very different historical courses and are on the opposite edges of europe . 
  just look at the architecture of both countries . 
  portugal is worlds apart from greece , and by that i mean that portugal has 10 times better architecture than greece . 
  bro , from my experience with french people , portuguese immigrants in france are stereotyped as hairy construction workers . 
  but i still think that portugal is closer to france than greece of course . 
  although , most of us associate greece with south italy the most , so it 's not like greece is from a different planet because of orthodoxy . 
  we are a south european country . 
   romania , bulgaria and greece are part of the balkans . 
  i consider greece to be a southern european country and i do n't associate it with the balkans . 
  just because we are part of that peninsula does n't mean that we are not south european . 
  turkey is not europe , does n't matter if it is a democracy or a dictatorship . 
  out of all these , greece is mostly similar with south italy . 
  i consider south italy the closest you can get to greece . 
   guy who sources his grandparents to political discussions when did that happen ? 
  stop lying in order to make a point . 
  he was of balkan origin afaik . 
  you 're being ironic , you consider ataturk as a turk ( and the greatest one ) , but you say that erdogan is georgian because you do n't like him . 
  if erdogan is georgia then ataturk is a balkan slav , since we 're talking about origins . 
  ^ turkish dude with greek flair , he 's not greek . 
  til . 
  even though its more likely that the people in question are r/turkey trolls . 
  what does this have to do with turkish police arresting and torturing kurdish villages ? 
  typial turkish whataboutism , turkish comments in this sub are just a circlejerk . 
  whenever someone posts something that puts turkey in a negative light , there has to be that turk who will say `` nice post history '' . 
  68 % upvoted . 
  and people say that turkish brigades in r/europe are n't a thing ? 
  i remember arguing with some turkisy guy and i was at -2 in like , one minute . 
  typical turkish tactic , calling other `` nationalists '' just because you disagree . 
  fuck golden dawn , they are scum . 
  i 'm tired of self-hating turks . 
  at least stop involving greece to it , we have nothing to do with you . 
  turk with american flair , greek nationalists do n't like me because i expose sensitive truths . 
  i am not a nationalist myself anyway . 
  turkey is not european , you people are just self-haters and want to enter the `` cool guy 's club '' . 
  turks even spread lies that they are of greek descent etc. 
  it 's sad how can someone hate himself so much and spend his free time trying to convince us that his country is european . 
  even though i have to say that i consider western turkey as eurasian . 
  in short : `` i 'm butthurt because my country is n't considered european , can you europeans please consider my country european ( you are dutch-turk ) '' btw i do n't consider armenia european either . 
  first of all , i do n't care whose ancestors you are . 
  i just pointed out the irony of you calling other people as hellenized when the same can be said for you . 
  i do n't really think that you are descended from greek armies , i consider pontian greeks to be hellenized people of the black sea . 
   the fact that we 've been exiled from our homeland which happens to fall under turkish rule at the moment does not render us turks . 
  i did n't say that . 
   do you deny their greek identity ? 
   yet we are turks and you are n't ? 
  again who said that ? 
  the truth is that when pontian refugees arrived in greece , people did n't consider them to be ` pure ' . 
  stop fantasizing about noble ancestors . 
   turks are closer genetically to medieval , and by extension ancient greeks , than the modern greeks of macedonia , attica and thessaly . 
  you ca n't handle the fact that mainland greeks have genetic continuity with the ancient greeks while you do n't , so you resort in lies that the ancient greeks were close to turks . 
  if anything , turks are the same people of ** byzantine anatolian subjects ** . 
  end of story .
