  this guy is very ignorant about the 90 's wars , he simply saw this thread and started talking about a war he knows nothing about . 
  the same `` arguments '' he used can be used against greece on some 20th century occasions , even though they would be wrong , as it would be wrong to use them against bosniaks as well . 
  i ca n't understand people like him , especially that `` this side was equally bad though '' . 
  it just does n't make sense , people were ethnic cleansed in big numbers and a genocide took place as well . 
  not to mention that the one who started the war was the one who commited the most war crimes . 
  i do n't pick fights with greeks , but i have disagreed with greeks , that 's true . 
  when it comes to serbs , you guys are weird , the things i say are something that i have seen many people on this sub say as well , but you , your previous sock accounts and some other guys act like it 's something personal . 
  i mean , i 'm not the only one on this sub who has said that the serbs are responsible for the 90 's wars . 
   you are seriously deluded if you think the serbs are the only ones to blame . 
  in an alternate universe where croatia is not invaded and the bosnian serbs are n't supported by serboslavia . . 
  he pretends that he does n't know what i 'm talking about . 
   serbia was n't even independent at that point . 
  nor was it ` independent ' when the other wars happened . 
  does that mean anything ? 
  was nazi germany the germany of today , and does that mean that they have nothing to do with each other in a historical point of view ? 
  there are victims on all sides in a war . 
  this particular war started because side a did n't allow sides b , c , and d to leave the union . 
  of course there was cherrypicking because side e left the union without a shot being fired . 
  it was side a who invaded and commited all these war crimes . 
  it was expected that the other sides would defend themselves or will commit crimes themselves . 
  slovenia and croatia . 
  in both cases it was a certain group that started the conflict . 
  people who were native in some areas were ethnic cleansed and genocided etc. 
  but still , these two cases can not be easily compared , different things led to different situations . 
   i remember you , you are that obsessed serb-hater . 
  honest question , how is this fallacy called ? 
  i do n't really know about all those fallacies . 
   look , all i am saying is that there are a lot of overlooked aspects and misunderstanding in this particular instance , you ca n't just go around throwing strawmen . 
  can you help me with those ` overlooked aspects ' ? 
  which side was the one who could n't realize that people wanted to get out of yugoslavia ? 
  and which side invaded other countries because they wanted to get out of yugoslavia ? 
  if you start digging into the war , you start discovering horrific crimes commited by everyone . 
  the ** greeks ** managed to successfully paint themselves as the victims , but this is far from the whole truth . 
  i am not implying their suffering was fabricated and the genocide overemphasized , quite the contrary . 
  all i am saying is that everyone seems to conveniently forget what led up to the events , it is not like the ** turks ** woke up one day and blinded by religious ** and ethnic ** fervor decided to slaughter ** the greeks ** . 
  does it sound like it makes sense ? 
  i see 7 countries on the graph , so 5/7 . 
  ta pragmata tha htan poly xeirotera ama to kosovo htan meros ths servias . 
  2 days ago you said in a comment that greeks and turks could n't live together ( which is true ) , and now you say that serbs and albanians lived together for centuries . 
  guess what , they had ethnic tensions as well . 
   kemal atat\u00fcrk and venizelos were good friends . 
  they were n't good friends , do n't spread lies . 
  we do n't know the sample of this research either . 
   on 12 may 2015 greece had its first survey ever showing majority support for same sex marriage at 56 % , while 35 % opposed it . 
  the survey was based on 1,431 respondents and was conducted by focus bari . 
  from wikipedia, 
  explain then . 
  this is about haplogroups though , it has nothing to do with language . 
  turkey has tons of different haplogroups that can be found in georgia , armenia , azerbaijan and iran . 
  if those haplogroups were present on the map , turkey would cluster close to these countries . 
  i 'm saying that because in other maps the dominant haplogroups in turkey are different . 
  i do n't trust this map anyway . 
  fyrom has a different majority haplogroup from both serbia and bulgaria , hungary is a special snowflake even though genetically they 're central european etc. 
  there are no big differences with the way that catholicism and orthodoxy act . 
   i 'd rather be disgraced than bombed . 
  no one said you 're getting bombed . 
  can you answer why are you having a problem with people supporting your country against an agressive and unstable neighbor ? 
   i did n't realise geography cared about the greek genocide . 
  and i did n't realize being neighbor with someone means anything . 
  especially when they undermine your borders . 
   yeah , and i remember when western europeans would roll their eyes about how greece and turkey were so immature for not `` getting over it already '' . 
  now , the tide has changed , but the same ignorance regarding the sensitivity of a complicated relationship persists . 
  very bad generalization . 
  ` complicated relationship ' ? 
  what does that mean exactly ? 
   the people in this thread suggesting sending rockets against turkey . 
  greeks suggest that too . 
   i have zero desire to provoke a war with our neighbours just because western europe has gone sour on turkey recently . 
  people support your country that is constantly getting disgraced by turkey and you 're blaming them for that . . ` our neighbors ' , how cute , they do n't even recognize the pontian genocide . 
  and greeks were sour on turkey way before western europe . 
  also who is talking about war ? 
  so i guess the turks were peaceful and respectful back then , but it was a german that pushed them . 
  no one is making us fight the turkish , wtf is going on with this comment ? 
  and ` tribe ' ? 
  you mean people , ` my people ' , not ` my tribe ' . 
  i do n't think that this sub ` loves ' or ` hates ' a group of people . 
  turkey gets some shit here because it 's the country that voted for erdogan . 
  people have a problem with erdogan , not with every single turk . 
  hungary is criticized too but it 's evident that people have a problem with orban and not with hungary itself . 
  same with britain and brexit etc. 
  yeah , this guy is weird , has always something bad to say about greece . 
  surprise surprise , he loves turks and turkey . 
  i thought he had a kinda pro-albanian policy, 
  op has already said that it 's a shitpost, 
  were they that bad ? 
  i do n't think that the guerilla battles against british forces were something big . 
  in the beginning they welcomed the brits . 
   and was n't that fight as ugly as every war is ? 
  ( that 's an impression i 've got ) not at all . 
  that will be interesting . 
  how come ? 
  it is known what happened to the greeks of smyrna , no one survived or stayed . 
  he belongs to a greek minority in turkey or ? 
   you painted it like only russia does that . 
  i did n't . 
   well the greeks did free themselves ? 
  fighting the ottoman empire is n't easy , and russia is far from greece . 
  the point is that russia tricked the rebels for her own interests . 
   [ more catholics ( 60k ) died in the slaughter conducted by the orthodox in one month in constantinople in 1182 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacre_of_the_latins ) that was a big mistake from the byzantines .
