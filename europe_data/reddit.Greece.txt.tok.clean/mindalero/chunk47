  what is evident is that turkey is going for closer cooperation with russia while the kurds are going for closer cooperation with the us . 
   also ypg occasionally deals with russia as well what is the problem there ? 
  ypg is an independent organization , turkey is a nato member that had chances of entering eu . 
  if turkey works closer with russia then the us will work closer with kurds . 
   i wo n't comment on your isis remark because that 's just your ignorance speaking . 
  i read it from articles , did n't say it out of nowhere . 
   the only reason kurds are the most effective fighters against isis is due to us airforce support . 
  without it , they would n't be able to do shit . 
  i 'm not an expert in the syrian war but they did n't have us military support from day one . 
   probability the biggest reason turkey is heading for more russia support to due to us and europe actions . 
  it 's simple geopolitics . 
  if your side does n't bring anything positive , they will go to the other side . 
  what do you except from turkey 's western allies when turkish people themselves vote for dictators ? 
  did any specific us and eu action lead erdogan into becoming a dictator ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  in fact turkey was getting eu money all those years and was a de facto eu candidate until recently . 
   especially if your `` ally '' is working with your # 1 enemy the us is are not helping kurds against turkey . 
  i hope that the us keep supporting the kurds . 
  they 're better fighters than the turkish army and most important , they give isis a hard time , while the turks bomb their positions and occasionally do deals with isis and russia . 
  i do n't want to choose sides on that dispute but i think that polish people get disappointed with ukrainian far-right . 
  this is what my uncle 's polish wife has told me . 
  this dispute is one of those disputes when you can easily say that it 's the nationalists that ruin relations for both sides . 
  it 's probably nationalists . 
  i 'm pretty sure the everyday ukrainians and poles have no problem with each other . 
   there is virtually no major difference between samaras and those other players you made excuses . 
  first of all , i did n't make ` excuses ' . 
  i simply mentioned their descent . 
  secondly , he looks different than the anatolian guy and the two pontian guys . 
  he looks mediterranean while they do n't . 
   for one more time . 
  you are a laughing stock , no need to stalk you . 
  i can realize its you from miles away from your bullshit which you spout obsessively . 
  :d you make no sense you fucking dumbass . 
  and get a life you weirdo , you are the one who 's obsessively stalking me . 
  greece 's population is 10.955.000 though . 
   i think the genoese were the only ones to send help . 
  the venetians and the pope sent help too . 
  you are not the one who decides who whines for constantinople . 
  it 's not like the byzantines were saints either . 
  that 's not true . 
  usually other orthodox people stick to their own cathedrals . 
  they view hagia sophia as greek . 
  get a life and stop stalking people . 
  samaras looks southern european . 
  send me a turk who looks a lot like him . 
  true . 
  but some have different descent . 
  number 9 is anatolian , number 3 and 18 are of albanian descent and number 14 and 15 are pontians . 
  i told you , we have assimilated some people , even though number 18 came to greece as an immigrant . 
  besides that , the picture looks southern euopean . 
  anyone can cherry pick random pictures . 
  it is not an unknown fact that there are anatolian greeks and pontian greeks who look like that . 
  greeks have assimilated a lot of people in our nation . 
  find something else to do instead of trying to troll greeks on reddit . 
  the ancient greeks were more wild than this, 
  yeah , anatolian music was brought to greece by christian anatolian refugees from the population exchange , not from turks , regardless from the fact that turkish music is anatolian with other influences . 
  interesting though , from what i could tell is that in romania manele music was considered gypsy music . 
  because for you , white people are only northern europeans . 
  turks are anatolian , greeks are southern european . 
  i have seen your comments on this sub and you always try to associate yourself with greeks . 
  why are you doing this ? 
  why do n't you associate yourself with countries that turkey is similar with , like iran or azerbaijan ? 
   a greek person with turkish ancestry that clearly shows these differences is mitroglu , slightly curved nose , more narrow eye and pubic-hair beard . 
  mitroglu is anatolian , so it makes sense . 
  the only dark greeks are those of anatolian descent who came here from the population exchange between greece and turkey . 
  we 're not brown . 
   the reason greeks today are brown is due to their turkish heritage , friendo . 
  you wish . 
  intermarriages were prohibited in the ottoman empire :  ancient greeks were white indeed , and they were south europeans too , like modern day greeks . 
  [ ancient greek vase ] ( http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/images/hb/hb_28.57.23.jpg )  the only brown ethnicities in europe are south italians , iberians , and greeks and surprise surprise , they all get their brown traits from ethnicities like turks and moors . 
  you know nothing about genetics . 
  but it does n't make sense to say that the greeks brought manele to romania . 
  it is known where it came from . 
  it 's traditional gypsy music mixed with turbo folk . 
  i think that even turbo folk originates from romania . 
  greeks never settled romania in big numbers in order to bring their customs with them . 
  gypsies did settle romania though , and they brought their customs with them . 
  i do n't go to clubs, 
  manele was brought to romania by gypsies . 
  it has nothing to do with greek music . 
  it 's mostly culture in my opinion . 
  english and northern europeans who listen to ed sheeran type of music will probably dislike balkan turbo folk . 
  and balkan people who listen to turbo folk will probably find ed sheeran boring . 
   [ could i call this greek music ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5pdgh9ktno ) of course , that 's a good one !, 
  probably one of the most known greek songs outside of greece, 
  it 's shitty but it 's not that popular, 
   ** [ greek music **  english music ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7sispndncg ) ** that song is a greek version of the very popular [ croatian/serbian song ** by severina feat ministarke ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvchbkh4jqy ) this thing is definitely not greek music . 
   and what is pure greek exactly ? 
  i never talked about ` pure greeks ' . 
   there were over 3,500 city states and colonies and aristotle was descended from some of those colonists so what is he not greek ? 
  aristotle was born in northern greece . 
  where was he from ? 
   fact of the matter is people joined empires to have easier lives . 
  you seem to be very sure . 
  it does n't mean that they are greeks . 
   anatolia was overwhelming greeks in the 1200 's before even one turk was there . 
  this part proves that you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  anatolia was never ` overwhelmingly greek ' , it was anatolian . 
  there were anatolian natives living there who were hellenized .
