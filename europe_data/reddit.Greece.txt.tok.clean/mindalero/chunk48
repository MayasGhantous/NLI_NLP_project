   so you guys can be greek again they were never greek to begin with . 
  socialist ` reforms ' . 
  the mess started with pasok actually . 
  wow , what a comeback . 
  finish middle school first before coming on reddit pretending to be a know-it-all . 
  apparently your sister likes idiots, 
  churchill was n't an idiot . 
  i never said that . 
  which are the main differences between navalny and putin ? 
  do n't give attention to this lunatic . 
  dude is stalking my comments like a detective . 
  how is being interested in genetics something bad ? 
  the dumbass even mentioned himmler . 
  and no , do n't take his over exaggerations for granted . 
   but they 're certainly not central-asian in genetic make-up . 
  yeah , they 're descended mostly from turkified locals of anatolia . 
  central asian genetics in turks are around 15 % . 
   the modern turkish population is not all that different genetically from people in greece . 
  it is . 
  they 're probably genetically similar to a big number of anatolian greeks though . 
  i 'm not agreeing with the other dude 's premises . 
  just wanted to point that out . 
  this could be the case for some eastern turks or some syrians . 
  not for greeks though . 
   most of the church is controlled by the russian orthodox church ( as in ussr times ) , which has no problem making politics and telling people who to vote for ; the orthodox church is too politicized . 
  i was expecting russia to try influencing the church on ex-soviet countries , they do the same in ukraine , where i think there is a rivalry between the ukrainian orthodox church ( kiev patriarchate ) and the russian orthodox church ( moscow patriarchate ) . 
  i also remember reading somewhere that the romanian orthodox church wanted to build a church in serbia for the romanian minority , but the serbian orthodox church did n't allow this . 
  are n't they supposed to belong to the same religion ? 
   so i 'll stick my nose in other people 's businesses as much as i like thank you very much . 
  whatever . 
  you 'd be pissed if people said things like ` greece should be a part of turkey ' . 
  a kosovar guy reading your comment will be equally pissed by you saying ` kosovo is serbia ' . 
   also , they are orthodox , which invokes sympathy in my deeply tribal heart so what ? 
  religion is n't dictating relations in the 21st century . 
  fyrom is orthodox too , but you probably do n't give a shit about them , you may even dislike the country . 
   just because i think that kosovo should belong to serbia ? 
  because your account is 7 days new and because the way you talk steems of trolling . 
  why do you care about kosovo anyway ? 
  i doubt you know anything about the history of the region , let alone how it got independence . 
  you should n't be sticking your nose to other people 's business . 
  troll account . 
  nope , it 's independent . 
  since communism did n't work they suddenly became religious again, 
   when i was a student in crete the foreigners studying together with the greeks were ... wait for it ... from arabic countries ... 
  when you go out in europe guess who will speak greek to you the arabs , ... because at some point they passed through greece . 
  there were a big greek community in egypt long before greeks immigrate to germany ... yeah i understand that but that does n't make for cultural similarities . 
  that 's simple stuff . 
   misirlou is an arabic song i have n't heard about that song and i do n't see how it adds to the discussion . 
   a lot of popular songs are remakes of arabic songs , while some greek songs become popular to those countries . 
  that happens everywhere . 
   funny fact andrea papandreous government during the 80s had a great collaboration with the arab world . 
  in his funeral there was a big representation from arabian countries to pay respects . 
  true . 
  but my point is that does n't make for cultural similarities . 
   greece is a crossroad of civilisation we have been interacting with other cultures and mentalities for centuries . 
  true . 
   regarding south korea some common things we have we both respect cherish and take pride with our history both countries have civil war both countries struggle with recognition of war crimes ( see pontian genocide and turkey , and they have the sex slaves and the war crimes of japan ) strong family bonds , children stay with parents till late adulthood ( \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03af \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03b5\u03af\u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5 \u03bf\u03b9 \u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 30\u03c1\u03b7\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b6\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03b5 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03b3\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b1\u03c2 ) we have a strong coffee culture like us ( \u03ba\u03b1\u03c6\u03b5\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd ) both countries share the top spots on plastic surgeries , they are also a very religious nation they also like to eat with their drinks like we do in tavernas . 
  if you pay enough attention south korea has the same stereotypes that greece had at 50s ... things are slowly changing tho . 
  i guess most are similar . 
  except respecting cherish , taking pride in history and driking in tavernas . 
  that happens everywhere . 
  also most people would like for their kid to study . 
   first you live in a world of your own so even if explain you my thoughts you would n't note understand them . 
  there 's no reason to drag all of greece with your thoughts . 
  you said something weird and it baffled me . 
  next time speak for yourself . 
   secondly stop stalking me . 
  yeah sure i 'm ` stalking ' you . 
  just do n't say dumb things . 
   because greeks have more things in common with the arabs seriously ? 
  not even close . 
   since the ancient times they had more interaction with the arabs and the persian tribes than with the european tibes . . 
  the part about persians is true , but greeks had more interaction with balkan tribes . 
   we share a disturbingly a big amount of things with south korea . 
  such as ? 
  how do you know ? 
  ` greetings from germany ' as if you 're not a fyromian guy living there . 
  i do n't want to add much regarding your comment , i do n't know the number of the slav-macedonians in northern greece . 
  i want to say that the slav-macedonians of northern greece sided with the communists during the civil war and were backed by both soviet union and yugoslavia . 
  their goal was to incorporate the greek part of macedonia into yugoslavia . 
  similar thing happened with the albanian minority of northern greece , most albanian families in northern greece collaborated with the nazis . 
  the similarity between the slav-macedonian and albanian minority of northern greece is that both fled greece in mass numbers after their defeats since they were afraid of repercussions . 
  what the hell is going on ? 
  croatian far-righters attacking albanian politicians in fyrom ? 
  in greece we had a kinda large albanian minority in the north . 
  they 're called chams . 
  there 's no reason to discuss about the ottoman era but during the nazi occupation of greece most of cham families collaborated with the nazis and when the war ended they were afraid of repercussions thus mass fled to albania . 
  when it comes to the greece of today , they 're an immigrant minority well integrated and there are not serious problems . 
  for example the last `` problem '' regarding albanians in greece was that a group of albanian-greeks who were serving in the greek army took a picture while doing an albanian patriotic gesture , something like [ this ] ( https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/man-demonstrating-sign-albanian-flag-close-up-view-sitting-stairs-showing-nationalism-hands-68134946.jpg ) . 
  apparently greek media ( except the serious ones ) did n't like it . 
  personally , i was born and raised in a place with tons of albanians and there were no big problems . 
  i have albanian friends , i went to the same schools with many albanian people and i can say that they are integrated . 
  found the serb . 
  guess what though . 
  they do n't want to take over the country . 
  they are an ethnic minority there that makes like 30 % of said country . 
  they want more representation . 
  the albanians of fyrom are not immigrants . 
  they 're an ethnic minority, 
  i corrected my comment and added the crisis as a reason too .
