  by telling you that the serbian empire did n't rule most of greece as you said and that their `` rule '' lasted for 25 years ? 
  you have problems . 
   you do n't know crap about history . 
  says you ? 
   [ he would n't proclaim himself the emperor of greeks ( along with serbs ) without a reason ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/serbian_empire_1355_ce_relief_english.png/442px-serbian_empire_1355_ce_relief_english.png ) it does n't matter . 
  he self proclaimed himself emperor of a place that he ruled for 25 years . 
  again , ** self ** proclaimed . 
   yes , arguably modern greeks and turks look similar and share many traits . 
  maybe the anatolian refugees we had during the population exchange were similar to turks , especially when it comes to cuisine and music . 
  things have changed now , they 're completely integrated . 
  ' i spoke to some random dude on the bus and he explained `` anthropology '' to me ' who are you kidding ? 
  ancient greeks were a mediterranean people , as we can see from [ ancient greek vases ] ( http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/images/hb/hb_28.57.23.jpg )  that 's why a lot of greek and roman statues the person has curly hair . 
  humans do n't look like statues you know . 
   so we are both just a hybrid of a bunch of races in the region . 
  therefore look alike . 
  not true at all . 
  anatolian it 's not byzantine/greek . 
  it 's anatolian . 
  pou to eides to ` pathos ' ? 
  sthn krhth den exw akousei kanena na asxoleitai me to sugkekrimeno thema . 
  prospathise na to katalaveis afto kai ase me hsyxo . 
  re vlaka den sou eipa na mhn asxoleisai mazi mou ? 
  true , but the definition of the region changed throughout the centuries . 
  you 're confused . 
  greece does n't give a shit about serbia . 
  well that 's stupid from them , i never said that they 're not responsible for the dispute . 
  yes , i 'm from crete but that does n't matter . 
   the fact that they use the term macedonians as you said earlier is nationalistic nonsense . 
  not to mention it hurts the brains of historians . 
  it 's the right of self determination . 
  i do n't agree with them calling themselves simple ` macedonians ' , that 's why i refer to them as slavic macedonians . 
   you are confused by the term jew that has both a racial and a religious usage . 
  there are hungarian transylvanians and romanian transylvanians , how about that ? 
   there were at the time that these bulgarians were there too . 
  they left though . 
   this is why their identity and history is slavic and not macedonian . 
  it would make sense to use a name related to that history . 
  to make it more simply for you , had the slavs invaded iberia there would probably be a sub-group of slavs who would call themselves ` slavic iberians ' . 
  again , it would be silly if they used a simple ` iberians ' . 
   i did n't say they are half bulgarians . 
  i said the country consists of a population half bulgarian . 
  which is what ** they call ** * ethnic * macedonian . 
  use the name they use and you just won them the dispute . 
  again , it 's self determination . 
  they 're not bulgarians , they 're slavic macedonians . 
  no , people here do n't care much about the dispute . 
  never heard anyone mention it in real life . 
  there is a macedonian region in bulgaria for example , no one in greece cares . 
  the problem is that there were times that their politicians pushed an agenda about a ` great macedonia ' which included greek macedonia and of course their attempt to make alexander the great as fyromian . 
  if it was n't for these two issues , there would have not been much of a dispute . 
  i do n't really think he is . 
  his comments on the greek sub and here are normal . 
  it 's when it comes to this particular discussion where he seems vocal . 
  probably because fyrom 's stance on the issue does n't help either . 
   the ancient macedonia they claim though is not geographical . 
  their claims on greek macedonia are nationalistic nonsense . 
   these slavs you talk about are bulgarians . 
  genetically they 're probably close to the bulgarians , yes . 
  but they have developed their own identity , which is the slav macedonian . 
   would you say that the jews that lived there are part of a macedonian nation too ? 
  there 's no need to belong to a macedonian nation to be a jew macedonian . 
  there were spanish jews , french jews etc. 
   would you say that about the turks too ? 
  there are n't hundreds of thousands of turks in macedonia . 
   the macedons were an ancient greek tribe and has nothing to do with the history of bulgarians . 
  i know that . 
  again , the macedonians of the antiquity were indeed only greek . 
  things changed after the region was invaded by slavs . 
   there is no macedonian nation . 
  there is a slavic macedonian one . 
   that country at the left of bulgaria is half bulgarians why do n't you go to tell them that they 're ` half bulgarians ' ? 
   a group of bulgarians no . 
  the term ` macedonian ' is a geographical term . 
  there are slavic macedonians and there are greek macedonians . 
  the people of fyrom are slavic macedonians , they actually were in the region way before many people from greek macedonia since many people from greek macedonia descend from christian anatolian refugees from the population exchange of 1923 . 
   gtfo why ? 
  they have that stupid `` correct religion '' . 
  since when are we ` best friends ' with serbia ? 
  [ they have best friends ] ( http://www.serb.rs/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zastave-zajedno-makedonija-srbija-unesko-serb.rs_.jpg ), 
   those 2k soldiers went there on the own . 
  surely you 're not suggesting that 2k soldiers in what was an unwinnable battle counts as european support ? 
  does it matter if they went there on their own ? 
  there were battles when they did n't . 
  the pope sent archers as well . 
  it was support , whether the battle was unwinnable or not . 
   yes , they hated each other . 
  times were different . 
  as if the catholics of the time did n't hate each other . 
   because it was n't . 
  the first crusade was called by pope urban ii . 
  it was a byzantine emperor that proposed the crusade . 
   what are you talking about ? 
  i ca n't remember that battle but i 'll do some search . 
  anyway , as another user told you previously , the byzantines helped the crusaders during the first crusade . 
   sure it does . 
  you 're under the impression that the asian subjects were like the africans under the british . 
  with your logic the roman empire was n't european . 
   it was n't the case , most emperors came from asia , few were from europe and very few if any were from greece . 
   they did n't cooparate they did , the most noted cooperation would be when the ottomans sieged constantinople . 
   the latins sacked constantinople some say that the sack of constantinople was a revenge for the [ massacre of the latins ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacre_of_the_latins ) .
