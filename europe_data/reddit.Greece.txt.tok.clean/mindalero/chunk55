  ` aegean macedonia ' lene oi skopianoi thn ellinikh makedonia . 
  a lot . 
  i 'm going to give some examples : vasileios/vasilis : ` king ' alexandros : ` protector of men ' stefanos : ` the crowned one ' orestis : ` he who stands on the mountain ' , ` he who can conquer a mountain ' filippos : ` friend of horses ' dionisios/dionisis : ` follower of zeus ', 
  this one is greek . 
  it comes from ancient greek ' \u03b1\u03b4\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5 ' ( pronounced ` athete ' ) . 
  balkan people use the one turks used though . 
  not at all . 
   there are out there more greeks who aree \u03a4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 and worship everything turkish not true, 
   lord byron was the joke of europe why ? 
  he helped greece so much , he even died in greece while the greek war of independence was ongoing and you call him a ` joke ' ? 
  he gave his life for greece . 
   back then serbia was fighting the ottoman empire as well and they continue fighting till the early of 1900 . 
  bulgarians fought against the ottoman empire as well . 
   the greek people fought side by side with the serbian during that time . 
  can you not understand that there were few serbian fighters in greece , and that western european support was bigger ? 
   bulgaria is christian orthodox only by name greece too . 
   romania ~ ~ n ~ ~ have more in common with their latin cousin italia and i do n't know if they are very religious or not . 
  you 're talking out of your ass , once again . 
  romania is an eastern european country , how the hell do they have a lot of things in common with italy ? 
  it 's mainly that both italian and romanian are romance languages . 
  romanians are also one of the most religious people in europe . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_romania )  romania is a secular state , and it has no state religion . 
  however , romania is one of the most religious countries in the european union and an overwhelming majority of the country 's citizens are christian . 
  the romanian state officially recognizes 18 religions and denominations . 
  [ 1 ] 81.04 % of the country 's stable population identified as eastern orthodox in the 2011 census [ romania is also building the world 's largest orthodox cathedral . ], 
  ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_people's_salvation_cathedral ) so i 'm asking you , just because they 're orthodox , does that make them a ` sister nation ' to us ? 
  btw romania and serbia have great relations with each other . 
   fyrom ... let me laugh in macedonian ... 
  still , fyrom is orthodox . 
   i do n't know ask a western macedonian with a serbian heritage , i am pontian . 
  they share some folklore traditions that i do n't really know about cause i was too busy learning my tribes tradition . 
  but they always talk about who similar their customs are . 
  there are so many greek with serbian roots . . mind blowing you made a claim that there are ` common traditions and customs ' between greece and serbia but now you ca n't back your claim . 
  you know why ? 
  because there are not common traditions and customs between greece and serbia . 
   so what if they supported fyrom ? 
  even our government with the indifferent politicians supported fyrom . 
  do they have to agree in everything with us ? 
  not even cyprus agrees in everything with us why should they ? 
  which greek politicians supported fyrom ? 
  also , i never said that they have to agree with us in everything . 
   i myself feel very upset for all those people who worship kebab and they always talk about the loving nation of kebab what do you mean with that ? 
   did they fought side by side with us during the wars against the ottoman empire ? 
  did n't i told you before that western europeans fought with us in the greek war of independence as well ? 
  lord byron is a prime example . 
  many people from western europe fought side by side with the greek revolutionaries . 
  also do n't forget the help we had from brits , australians and kiwis in ww2 . 
   do they share the same religion with us ? 
  fyrom , bulgarian and romania share the same religion with greece too . 
  does that make us ` sister nations ' with them ? 
  and seriously , what has religion got to do with international relations in the 21st century ? 
   ~ ~ did ~ ~ do they share traditions and customs with us ? 
  what ` common traditions and customs ' do the serbs share with us ? 
   did they took care some of our people during our civil war ? 
  when did that happen ? 
  actually , the yugoslav government of belgrade actively supported the fyromian separatists . 
  learn some history . 
   maybe you prefer words like cousin nation i do n't prefer anything . 
  during the greek war of independence many people from northern europe came to help greece . 
  also during ww2 many brits , australians and kiwis fought in greece next to greeks . 
  does that mean that we 're ` sister nations ' with these countries ? 
  do n't you see my flair ? 
  if you 're asking for a region though , i 'm from crete but that 's irrelevant . 
  the people who support serbia are usually nationalists . 
   it 's a sister nation to greece since when ? 
  what have they done for greece ? 
  what has greece done for them ? 
   well , majority of greece loves serbs what ? 
  not true , i have n't noticed anything like that . 
  what i have noticed though is that some greek nationalists like serbia a lot for some reason . 
   but i am greek i am totally biased with serbia . 
  how are you ` totally biased ' with serbia by being greek ? 
  i was just scrolling through old r/askeurope threads and saw your comment , why not reply to it ? 
  i was n't stalking . 
   whole reddit calls your bullshit out , even your own countrymen when did that happen ? 
   we have common stuff with greece the only common stuff you have with greece is some anatolian foods that anatolian refugees brought in greece during the population exchange, 
   more than the other mediterranean countries ( of europe ) ? 
  not more than italy tbh , especially south italians are considered some sort of bros here . 
  greeks generally have a very good opinion on portugal , spain , france and italy . 
  greeks like spaniards a lot . 
   or if we really really stretch it and adopt some kind of hellenoturkist neo-byzantine shit , cyprus and greece . 
  do n't be cringy . 
   and its loss is still mourned that 's not very true tbh . 
  also northern epirus is not so important to our history imo, 
  yeah i know, 
  the massacres of thousands of greek civilians by ottoman troops . 
  [ an example ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/chios_massacre ) tbh greek revolutionaries killed many turkish settlers as well, 
  yes i 'm kinda young . . 
  i feel kinda embarrassed that there are greeks who are very popular and i had no idea of them . 
  well he came from greek macedonia, 
  yeah varoufakis is known mainly in europe . 
  i thought more europeans know giannis because he is considered on of the top young european athletes, 
  he is one of the most talented nba players right now , so i guess many people know him in the rest of europe too , but you are right , varoufakis could be more famous due to political events . 
  btw , who is the vangelis you mentioned ? 
  greece had a lot of great people centuries ago , it 's recently that we have a shortage problem :d, 
  living : giannis adetokunbo dead : alexander the great, 
  i 'm gon na go with the ancient times , the [ hellenistic period ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/hellenistic_period ) .
