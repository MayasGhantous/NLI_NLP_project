  i can go to most of the mainland . 
  i need at least the double to go to some islands . 
  also to the one op is refering ... '' \u039a\u03ac\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03ad\u03b6\u03bf '' , he pretends to be chinese . 
  we also say in the same context , '' \u039a\u03ac\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7 \u03c0\u03ac\u03c0\u03b9\u03b1 '' , he pretends to be a duck . 
  anyone saying that any mediterranean country has bad food must be out of their mind . 
  does n't portugal have hot enough climate so you can hung clothes to dry ? 
  i thought they have something related to galicia that cry about , like the climate or politics . 
  the stereotype is that it 's just part of their personality that they are cry babes . 
  i relate with galcians btw . 
  what galicians cry about ? 
  crete : they have vendettas . 
  thessaloniki : they drink frappe and sit at cafes all day . 
  larisa : they are villagers . 
  pirgos : there is a lot of mafia there . 
  i am in / r/portugal and in / r/greece . 
  in / r/greece there are more posts and commends in engish than in / r/portugal . 
  i ca n't figure out why . 
  also in / r/greece we do n't ever transalete any of these terms . 
  drink beers outdoors . 
  fortunately we are allowed to drink in public . 
  i do n't . 
  greek people have the `` third world '' mindset nowadays . 
  nothing like the glorious ancient greeks . 
  there are many people that justify their patriotism as ancestors of the ancient . 
  367 years !? 
  mind sharing some pictures ? 
  i hope we stick only with the daylight savings time . 
  i need the sun the afternoon more than the morning . 
  it 's a tradition . 
  we would make them in kindergarden . 
  i was also confused because the sun is n't even that bright in march . 
  one reason i would think back then was that our skin was n't used of sunlight after the winter . 
  it does n't block the sun of course . 
  it 's just a tradition . 
  its common in greece and i was curious to know if it 's a tradition anywhere else . 
  english is not my mother tongue but i think it 's different from place to place . 
  in spanish `` tiempo '' means weather of time . 
  in greek '' \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 '' means weather or time too . 
  i do n't know if this is coincidence or there is some science behind it but i find it odd . 
  to me means nothing that i am greek . 
  i like some of the culture but i can like it even if i am not greek . 
  i have done it too . 
  it 's cheap and gets you drunk . 
  same as pasta with ketchup is cheap food that makes you not hungry . 
   hot beer is still a beer . 
  * someone on reddit *, 
  ouzo . 
  really bad spirit drink . 
  there are more people having a vegan diet for religion than for ideals . 
  it 's easy to find food without meat , milk and eggs but there are n't many vegans and vegetarians here . 
  greeting comes next . 
  haha it is silly . 
  like you make sure everytime that it was n't a butt call . 
  i do n't remember such detail but i notice that greek accents sounds closer to american . 
  maybe also south african now that i think of it . 
  maybe it 's not common for mediterranean cuisine as i see in this thread . 
  this has to be true about the skin of the fruits . 
  sadly this is where most of the chemicals that are sprayed on are too . 
  we have a somewhat famous cuisine . 
  everything that we also face . 
  but this espain thing i can not understand . 
  it 's hard for me to make `` she '' and `` see '' sound different . 
  also many vowels are hard to distinguise . 
  like `` ea '' and `` ee '' . 
  does n't taste good . 
  riverside . 
  me too . 
  mine was very immature . 
  but then again i have met many other young people from other countries that are as immature as her . 
  i do n't really know . 
  i was with some friends and we saw something in the water . 
  at first we though it was somebody swimming . 
  then it came a little closer and it looked nothing like a man , it looked more like a dog . 
  then it quickly dived in the water . 
  i did n't see it clearly but it ca n't be something else . 
  we were very suprised because the sea near thessaloniki was very poluted and not even people swim in it . 
  this seal was a sign that it 's not as poluted anymore or that animals get used to it . 
  i have seen a seal and some other time a dolphin from the land in thessaloniki . 
  i do n't think greeks have problem with the name `` istanbul '' , it 's also greek after all . 
  it 's unjustified only if you are young . 
  i love being young . 
  also in english the word that comes from `` book '' ( i do n't know its root ) is the `` bookstore '' . 
  in greek `` library '' is '' \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03b8\u03ae\u03ba\u03b7 '' , this is what `` biblioteca '' comes from . 
  which its exact meaning is `` book case '' . 
  chaval is used a lot more in spanish . 
  while engish word `` library '' has latin roots the word for it in some ( if not all ) romance languages has greek roots . 
  yes . 
  also the portuguese understand easier spanish than the spanish portuguese . 
  the two languages are very similar when writen . 
  source : i learned both . 
  i live in macedonia , the region . 
  it would be very weird to be sold to macedonia the country . 
  judging from some people i met from there , our cutures are very different . 
  not really . 
  but there are many people here who say `` hitler was a good leader like alexander the great was , but he was born in the wrong era '' . 
  they are the golden dawn supportes of course . 
  they indeed believe that they belong to the best race and that they have the greek traits in their dna . 
  the most of them would certainly be neo-nazis if they were born in a coundry that had n't had conflicts with germany . 
  i start to suspect that / r/greece is full of these people . 
  lol !,
