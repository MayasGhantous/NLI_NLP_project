( he was n't liked already , being a dictator and all ) this is not true . 
  i liked / r/europe when there were less greek redditors ... 
  we know . 
  we were ( i at least ) just dicking around . 
  since geography is n't really their thing , i do n't think they will ever find it . 
  prague is the safest place to be right now :p, 
  i guess we 're fine with the size of our penises, 
  not where i live , 
  free ice cream for everyone, 
   well , everything in the balkans has at least some pork in it . 
  i guess we all stand united when it comes to pissing off the ottomans :p, 
  [ there you go ] ( http://greekfood.about.com/od/stuffedgrapeleaves/r/stuffed-grape-leaves-with-rice-and-herbs-dolmathakia.htm ), 
  since people seem to just downvote you , i 'll go ahead and ask . 
  why ? 
  ban anyone who asks for money ... 
  i wonder who that someone could be ... 
  human sacrifice for sure ... 
  sorry but ... who the hell invited you ? 
  you do realize that you just made his point right ? 
  ( of course if this was a joke , it was well done ), 
  i guess the name was kind of a [ hint ] ( http://www.wordreference.com/gren/%cf%86%cf%8d%cf%81%ce%b1 ), 
  so you people do n't get the wrong ideas ( again ) ? 
  i think there is a difference between living ** with ** your parents and living ** off ** your parents ... i 'm 32 and i 've been living with my father for the last 9 years or so . 
  we 're splitting bills , household work ( dishes , laundry etc etc ) and are basically roommates . 
  sssssssssshhh ... not so loud ... you 'll wake him up, 
  yeah ... do n't go to athens people, 
   and we do n't have fist fights in parliament ...  must be really boring then :p, 
  some say that this was the endgame all along, 
  people still do, 
  in the balkans it is, 
  that is until you infect said pussy with chlamydia ( true story , not proud ), 
  the masturbation goes cloud ... 
  you keep bringing up the `` salaries of the soldiers '' up ... it never crossed my mind that people would need a salary to defend their homes and i am not going to make a comment about the `` to save our own skin '' part ... 
  i like it , 
  if i made another account , with a german flair and replied by writing `` amateurs ... only 7 '' , would that make me an asshole ? 
  i 'm sure they are on reddit right now ... 
  i wish i could say the same ... 
  earthquakes can be fun ( if not greater then 4-5 one the richter scale ), 
  there was a second i thought it was you ... 
  do you honestly believe that even if he had the money , anybody would bother ? 
   mediterra , from the south with the power of great cuisine and weather ; occi , from the west with the power of economy and actual power ; ikea , from the north with the power of coolness and standard of living ; and volga from the east with the power of cheap labor and hot women . 
  this was wonderfull, 
  corruption in greece existed before siemens was even founded , so it ; s not like siemens came over and handed money over to decent , honest greek politicians who just could n't resist to the amount of money , bringing corruption to the country.let 's face it : it is in our mentality more or less ( something about us being a part of the ottoman empire for too long etc etc - once again : not our fault ) . 
  there are different types of bribery . 
  a ) you bribe some official to be selected over your competitor for a project or whatever . 
  b ) you bribe to avoid time-consuming and unnecessary bureaucracy c ) you bribe to get your job done , because the public servant/official is so blatantly corrupt . 
  the last one is most common here in greece . 
  want a surgery ? 
  give money to the surgeon . 
  want to build something or get a license for your business ? 
  bribe the employees at the urban planning department . 
  they are the most notorious for not giving a fuck about your case ( they will literally ignore it ) if you do n't bribe them . 
  and you ca n't do anything about it . 
  the courts will either have some kind of deal with the public servant/official or it 's going to take too much time and money to get the case to the court , because of bureaucracy ( greek justice is famous for being really slow ) . 
  plus there is this mafia mentality in every greek profession branch - you fuck with one of us , you fuck will all of us . 
  so what does the state do about that ? 
  well ... nothing . 
  it is pretty obvious in the article that the cases came to light only by foreign investigations . 
  here in greece either nobody bothered or the investigations were stalled and then forgotten . 
  and it makes sense , because after all it looks like half the greek politicians received bribe money one way or another . 
   the sealed report , which has not been made public , allegedly contains the names of 20 of the leading greek politicians who have together received more than $ 100 million in recent years to `` promote '' the company , according to greek press reports . 
  and that is just siemens . 
  siemens of course was n't giving away the money because they were in a hurry to give the greek people the technology they so needed . 
  they probably made the x10 amount of money they gave away . 
  and the money they made , was eu-money . 
  add to that that basically every company worked like that in greece and you get a clue as to why we are in this shit . 
  so who 's to blame ? 
  i do n't know . 
  probably everybody involved . 
  what i do know , is that allot of people , made allot of money through this and it was n't me . 
  hahahahahahahah excellent !!, 
   you seem to have issue with the elderly because syriza got the lowest numbers from them . 
  you make assumptions . 
  i got a an issue with them because nd got the highest number from them . 
  on the other hand i give them credit for keeping the numbers of golden dawn low . 
  by the same logic i should rant about fishermen and farmers and i do n't . 
   just because your guy lost the election . 
  again ... you are making assumptions . 
   i can point you to an equally misinformed slacker working in the public sector who voted for syriza . 
  no need to . 
  i ca n't point out those idiots myself . 
  but thanks anyway . 
  and if by that you 're implying that i support those people or syriza , you 're dead wrong . 
  the hell was that all about ??? 
  certain social groups are already not represented in a ( our ) democracy . 
  those under 18 are not . 
  prisoners are stripped of their voting rights . 
  and you do n't really see mental patients lining up outside of public schools on election day . 
  there are social groups that are excluded , it 's just a question of who and why . 
  there is a difference between asking `` should they vote ? '', 
  and stating `` they should not vote '' . 
  i never claimed that i have more rights then everybody else or people who just happen to be in a different age group . 
  your words , not mine . 
  i gave an example of why one might make that question or be in a dilemma about elderly people voting . 
  let me give you another one , because i believe there are moral/ethical issues attached . 
  let 's say we - the greeks of 2012 - decide , that since we are in a crisis , to go the to chinese and tell them : `` give us now 30bn euros and in 2050 we will repay you 300bn euros '' . 
  how is that fair to the greeks of 2050 ? 
  people who are not even born yet will have to deal with the consequences of our actions . 
  is it morally/ethically acceptable for us to do such a thing ? 
  also you have to admit that at some level those elections where sort of an unofficial referendum on the eu and the ez and our part regarding those 2 institutions .
