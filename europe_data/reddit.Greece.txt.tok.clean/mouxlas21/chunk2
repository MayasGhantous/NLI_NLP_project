  you really mean to tell me that some random pensioner from grevena or komotini or levadia had any idea about what those 2 institutions really are ? 
  how they benefit or harm us ? 
  all they know about the subject is what they see on the tv news after the `` mesimerianadika '' and before the turkish drama serials . 
  and all they heard through the campaign was that `` illegal immigrants are coming to get you '' and `` the left is after your savings and pensions '' . 
  you have to admit that situations like that do raise some questions . 
  and you can not possibly have any idea about what my idea of democracy is reading only a few sentences . 
  much less to label it as dangerously skewed . 
  that was a bit uncalled for . 
  try asking for clarification next time instead of jumping to random conclusions . 
   this is balanced with a right to free speech and the key point is that the offence is committed if it is deemed that ** a reasonable person ** would find the content insulting . 
  well theists and reason do n't usually mix , so i guess he 'll be allright :p but all fun aside ... who 's to determine if a person is reasonable or not ? 
  ... and then they say `` pay your taxes '' ... 
  age restrictions ... you are considered to be not mature enough when you are let 's say 16 and ca n't vote ... good i get that ( i don ; t really agree but anyway ) ... but how mature is let 's say my grandma who is 70 + and suffers from dementia ( true story ) ? 
  ... also let 's be realistic . 
  how long do you think a 65year old is going to be around ? 
  how can that person vote on my future when he/she ai n't going to be around to see the effects of his vote ? 
  35c here ... guess you would n't survive that :-p, 
  how the fuck do you threaten somebody for being gay ??? 
  `` start fucking women or else ... '' ??? 
  thank you ... really interesting to be honest ... makes you question a few things about democracy, 
  just send it our way ... thank you, 
  plus ... they forgot to take it out from the sea ... it does n't work like that ... use a rope or something :p, 
  hhahahahah ... i love your consistency, 
  btw ... [ not everybody seems to be as happy as we ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=el&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=el&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.lifo.gr%2fteam%2fbitsandpieces%2f31494 ) ( not the best translation , but ask if you need anything ), 
  so ... no black holes afterall ? 
  ... that 's sad ... 
  it is ... i know that one is used in the us and the other in the uk , but i was wondering about which one is the `` correct '' term to use . 
  hahahahhahaha epic !!, 
  why the fuck is he having a greek flair then ? 
   also , getting ridiculously drunk and shagging a lot . 
  +1 ... got to love erasmus students :p, 
  your * ... stop embarrassing the rest of us, 
   the only way on how things will move on is that we fight this conflict and select a winning model on how to advance . 
  that is the only way to fair well in the market . 
  did n't they say that about the cold war ? 
  so is it `` arse '' or `` ass '' ? 
  care to explain ? 
  just send the money our way , thanks . 
  does that mean i should cancel my vacations ? 
  welcome to / r/europe, 
  still ... greece has defaulted 5 times since ... plus war of independence , lost war to the turks , first balkan , second balkan war , first world war , asia minor dissaster , depression , second world war , civil war and a dictatorship ... 
  i do n't know why you got downvoted , because it is true . 
  and people do n't seem to worry which worries me ... i mean do people feel ok that the police could be controlled by those thugs ? 
  a bit ??? 
  :p i 'm pretty sure about the reaction everyone will have should she be in the stands and the director decides to focus on her, 
   well , it is not good practice to publish as news , cases that have not been proven as ` racist ' . 
  also it would be noted that these cases refer to illegal-immigrants . 
  contradiction my friend . 
  yes ... these cases refer to immigrants , but no no no ... nothing to do with racism . 
  sure ... just a big coincidence i suppose  also it would be noted that these cases refer to illegal-immigrants . 
  so i guess this all makes it ok then . 
   and finally i do not get why a greek citizen victim of an immigrant equals a crime victim but an immigrant victim equals a racism victim . 
  because no greek citizen has been beaten up just because he or she is greek  it is just too unrealistic to pull the racism card with greece 's crime rate !, 
  care to explain how those ( racism/greece 's crime rate ) are related ? 
  unless of course you mean that crime brings more crime and the immigrants ( ... illegals that is ... because we treat legals so wonderful ) started it all  they immigrants ( illegal or not ) will have to accept the crime rate on the country they live in . 
  i wonder what else they have to accept because they happened to have been born somewhere else, 
  i wonder why ... 
  because supposedly they are after the illegals only ... i guess the thought that this kind of shit also discourages people from getting here as tourists is too complex for some people, 
  i have to say i expected more from the cretans ... 
  yes and replace romania with greece, 
  what country ? 
  ( i will assume somewhere in the balkans ), 
  [ samaras ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egrmkviihqq ) & [ kouvelis ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5rshnhnqce ) ... i 'm to disgusted too translate for the fellow redditors, 
  thank you for that , 
   imminent invasion by the various powers in north africa . 
  care to explain ? 
  i do n't like armies in general ... they have a bad habit of taking over ( for the greater good of the nation/kingdom/tribe / group ofcourse ... ) ... i do n't like rules in general and armies tend to have many , that you also have to follow blindly because questioning authority is a big `` no no '' ... i understand why and how this helps and is necessary , but i still do n't have to like it ... having served in one i can tell you it 's a waste of time, 
  yes ... nea dimokratia owes 120million euros as a party and pasok 111 million ... but yeah ... those 2 will save us from our dept [ in greek ] ( http://www.infospoudes.gr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1441:ta-xreh-ton-ellinikon-kommaton&amp;catid=24620:ellada&amp;itemid=1035 ) and [ google translation ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=el&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=el&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.infospoudes.gr%2findex.php%3foption%3dcom_content%26view%3darticle%26id%3d1441%3ata-xreh-ton-ellinikon-kommaton%26catid%3d24620%3aellada%26itemid%3d1035 ), 
  so what 's the difference ? 
  i 'm greek ... trust me i know ... it 's money that we ca n't afford to waste in the first place ... but still i do n't really see the need , unless there is something about russia that i do n't know, 
  and we need such an army because ... . ?? 
  ups !, 
  ... i thought you were making fun, 
  soooo ... where 's the misconception ? 
  i know ... just saying . 
  i mean the last guy who made public territorial claims , was our little friend adolf and we all know how that went ... what i 'm trying to say is that this is the balkans and since you 're romanian you know too , how shit goes around this part of the world, 
  leave us alone ... we 're not balkanians , we were here first , we built everything , we blah blah blah [ insert nationalistic bullshit that says how better the greeks are then everybody else in the region ], 
   united states of america - does the name of the usa imply teritorial claims over the rest of the americas ? 
  well ... they did started as a much much smaller country at first ... 
  so you go to meetings then ? 
   i have no sense of nationalism just comfortable familiarity . 
  +1 ... nothing more to say, 
  i 've seen that ... but i also suspect a huge difference when it comes to north/south ( the north being more conservative i believe ), 
  i 'd love to see what the results are in a north vs. south format, 
  the sad things is ... he might actually improve things, 
  welcome to the world of greek politics, 
  aliens take over ? 
  golden dawn 9.2 % ???? 
  wtf ??? 
  and no kke ( communist party ) ? 
  ... well i guess that 's what happends when your youth festival usually suck ... 
  if they do ... i 'm leaving the country, 
  samaras 's ambition knows no limits ... he is inconsistend in his programm ... plus the perspective of some of his party members being part of the government scares the shit out of me ... 
  they are a coalition of parties ... mostly left-wing oriented if that answers your question, 
  well 400 years of ottoman rule and then having the english and later the americans dictate foreign and domestic policies can do that to a nation ... but i feel we are a bit to nationalists ... i think you guys have it just right ... for example if portugal had won the euro 2004 they way greece did ( in greece and beating greece in the final ) it would turn out very bad for the portuguese fans celebrating in greece . 
  people here were actually amazed at your reaction as hosts ... go figure, 
  it does matter . 
  there is a difference between living in a country and reading about the country . 
  you ca n't just make comments like that without having a bigger picture . 
  you are right about the notion .
