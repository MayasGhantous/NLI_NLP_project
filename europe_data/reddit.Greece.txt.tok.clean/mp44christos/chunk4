   the church dates back in 1630 , but is no longer in use . 
  [ wiki link in greek ] ( https://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/%ce%a0%ce%bb%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%b5%ce%af%ce%b1_%cf%84%ce%b7%cf%82_%ce%a3%cf%80%ce%bb%ce%ac%ce%bd%cf%84%ce%b6%ce%b9%ce%b1%cf%82 ) one of the most interesting historical buildings in chania . 
  the square and the platanus tree there are also full of history and i urge you to look further . 
  the city itself is probably one of the most beautiful and historical in all of greece . 
  i strongly advise for you to visit when you are in the area . 
  maybe a badge of shame in our clothes would have the same efficiency !, 
  i think they meant to call it chimney cake festival but instead gave it this boring name so not to overflow it with addicts getting 10 cakes each ... beautiful masquerade !, 
  time to book my tickets !, 
  well thats what `` modern democratic countries '' do take notes `` fascists '' and `` terrorists '' . 
  problem is by having those ` illegal ' mosques its harder to control and find out radical islamic sects so this is what pushed many people from all sectors of politics into supporting the official mosque idea . 
  the new mosque is nearly ready though . 
  it is supposed to be opened soon tm, 
  or you can go for a permanent vacation in some aegean island ... thats if of course you can get passed the secondary id checks ... 
  question is ... are you gavur enough to handle shity greece ? 
  they are building a new mega cami ... and erdo has his friend build it !, 
  nepotism to the fullest !, 
  correction the have build it already : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%87aml%c4%b1ca_republic_mosque, 
  oh i need to see a video of that ... 
  never once in greece did polls represent the truth . 
  and before every election tsipras won he was behind in points ... 
  meanwhile turkey ... oghh ... bad joke i know !, 
  no translation no context no nothing op . 
  i just see him staring at an eu and french flag . 
  i saw that 's why i deleted my comment but you were too fast, 
  strategic position , big country , big military are the main reasons ... 
  just drink lots of water and you will be fine !, 
  oh wait it 's ramadan ... well you are fubar !, 
  omg ... do n't tell me they are going to turn them into soap ? 
  i said that on an earlier post i made . 
  and yes you are right . 
  the name was akps doing btw ... 
  they hate it . 
  mind you the kemalist friendly junta executed him . 
  i am not saying that the kemalists are angels . 
  but they are a much preferred choice for greece . 
  of course greece would be better of with a divided turkey . 
  but that 's dreaming . 
  but make no mistake if it was n't for syria hid knows what erdo would have done to divert publics attention ... 
  for the 80k in istanbul it 's the conservatives fault actually . 
  menderes look him up . 
  the kemalists have n't been in a government as a single party for decades . 
  they have played with nationalism in order to hide their incompetence from the 70s and later . 
  still i would rather trust them instead of akp . 
  if you met many turks as i have you would know that akp mhp are too radicals to be trusted with anything . 
  actually you can tell akp voters apart just from their looks . 
  actually we criticise erdoganistan ... we all hope good old secular turkey returns ... 
  worst think it can happen is some good old dogfights in the aegean ... with erdo on the other hand we get ottoman empire 2.0 ... btw we all are gavur nazis pa\u015fam !, 
  it 's just forced replacement !, 
  mixed with an armenian visit ( a super long visit ) as we call it ... / s, 
  too late ... in general everything chp does is too late and too little or to subtle . 
  they should not have voted for the laws that allowed for this mess in the first place ... 
  still i wish you good luck agains erdo\u011fan 's empire kom\u015fu karde\u015fim !, 
  please elaborate ... or get downvoted to oblivion for all i care ... 
  its beginning ... rise of rize sultanete ( aka erdoganistan ) has begun ... 
  why did people vote for this guy ? 
  he is half crazy ... 
  the stuff he has said is beyond belief !, 
   vardaska https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vardar actually a really good name choice !, 
  but still it needs something more . 
  because they can still claim the whole river region for themselves . 
  from parts of kosovo till greece, 
  this is not the subbreddits for this questions ask that on some holiday subreddit or in their respective countries subreddit . 
  in general i would pick italy for 2 months go from sicily sardinia till milan venice . 
  easily worth it . 
  rome and florence alone needs 1 month ... 
  the obvious conclusion to this is that whole europe is fascist . 
   since traditionally in turkish the word for arabs ( arap ) was used for black people for some reason . 
  guess what we also say arabs meaning blacks in greek . 
  and if i had to guess the same goes for persian ... 
  unsinn ... ottoman empire was great !, 
  cant wait for erdogans rize empire to rise !, 
  fallen soldiers he send to death in vain you mean ? 
  you read one too many akp newspapers i feel ... also this really is a fun post breaking the monotony of may this may that . 
  if you want akp and nationalistic shipposts you can visit r/turkey, 
  http://warhammer40k.wikia.com/wiki/hellstorm_cannon omg the memories !!, 
  so they used 650kg of he bombs ... thats like 3 bombs ? 
  i am greek and i believe in unicorns, 
  busra voted yes in the referendum ... its also the old ottoman capital . 
  in my imagination it must be very conservative . 
  i have only been in izmir and eskisehir . 
  eskisehir seamed too conservative for me coming from izmir . 
  funny enough that 's what my turkish friend told me . 
  they at least get weird looks by anyone like they are criminals . 
  keep in mind that both cyprus and greece say that the first invasion was justified . 
  and many greeks are thankful for turkey for foiling the juntas coup attempt because that was the reason the junta fell . 
  also the putschists had started killing turks and greeks alike . 
  and there were massacres with both sides as the victim . 
  second invasion was a complete mess diplomatically for turkey . 
  ecevit ordered the invasion while on ceasefire and being in negotiations with the days old greek republic . 
  and yes then they basically cleansed the north half from greeks killed civilians with many missing . 
  greece is still waiting for bones of the fallen soldiers ( bones play a huge role in greek funeral customs ) . 
  he said gavdos because at one point some great political turkish mind said that it should belong to turkey . 
  recently some newspapers claimed the same for agathonisi and oionouses ( all of them inhabited ) ... 
  i expect soon they will say crete evia and peloponisos should belong to turkey ... 
  dude what islands are you talking about ? 
  this [ symbol ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/atheismlogo.png ) is the right one . 
  all others bring hatred and war . 
  i found it in crete ... 
  i dont know but he seamed casual just leaving in parked like that in what is effectively greece 's texas ...
