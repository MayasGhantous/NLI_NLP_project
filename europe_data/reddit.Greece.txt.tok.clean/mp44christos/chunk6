  2 3 days marinated . 
  problem is no restaurant is going to do this . 
  in general it does n't smell bad just different and that 's why you think bad . 
  you have been told your whole life do n't eat pork because it is dirty and smells . 
  so going and trying it out will subconsciously smell bad to you . 
  btw i had some turkish friends trying it out and they all said smells bad but tastes the same . 
  it was low quality gyros though so it even smelt to me . 
  fun fact med students who use electric knives tell me human tissue smells the same way as pork . 
  this is the reason why it 's prohibited in islam not because it 's dirty . 
  i know iranians eat wild pork very frequently if they are not religious ... do turks do the same ? 
  or is it some kind of taboo ? 
  he is laughable ... everything he says is delusional and he knows that he would be forced to do the exact same reforms as tsipras . 
  and to top it of he is part of an old political system and a part of a big and corrupt political family . 
  neither macron or thatcher want to have anything in common with that looser ... 
  and including 94 sick uneducated `` insert f word here '', 
  completely wrong subreddit ... try posting in r/greece, 
  greek is the same and puts german to shame with its word combinations ... 
  there is a thing you can do with the language called '' \u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03b9\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 '' meaning word ( \u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03b9\u03c2 ) and shaping ( \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03b8\u03c9 ) . 
  the best modern greek writer [ nikos kazantzakis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nikos_kazantzakis ) made a book as an continuation of homers odyssey [ \\ ( the odyssey : a modern sequel \\ ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_odyssey:_a_modern_sequel ) in which he used over 7500 greek words that were made by him . 
  let 's play `` spot the turkish players '' ! ... 
  i give up ... 
  ouzo and turkish raki are the same . 
  when we say raki ( tsipouro ) in greece we mean a drink like zivania from cyprus . 
  its technically made the same way but raki ( greek ) uses alcohol from grapes instead ouzo is made from industrial alcohol provided by the state . 
  ouzo has almost always many other things mixed for taste . 
  raki ( greek ) is being drank without diluting it ... the hardcore way !, 
  tldr : ouzo = raki ( turkish ) raki ( greek ) different . 
  btw ask your friend the name of his meals . 
  and if he knows cretan . 
  turkish raki is the same as ouzo . 
  cretan raki is different, 
  i have been to both thessaloniki and izmir . 
  and yes in that respect they are really similar . 
  also both of them have been destroyed by fire . 
  although i find thessaliniki more sane than the chaos of izmir . 
  size probably has alot to do about it . 
  no ... just maybe a bit more beautiful and interesting ... 
  still nothing beats nafplio or chania !, 
  btw historically it always was a jewish city not greek not turkish ... israel has bigger claims to that city than anyone ... btw beatiful what ? 
  good ... now its turn for the rize empire to take turkeys place !, 
  do n't judge from reddit ... 
  in general reddit is more conservative that the rest of greece . 
  yes it is weird ... well like i said grey wolves are the most hated . 
  and some conservatives like erdogan because he is conservative ... duh ... 
  the hated group is for golden dawn btw ... 
  i do n't believe that anyone will have any hatred towards you or kemal . 
  in general most people wo n't accuse him of anything nor will they mention this to you as a problem between greek turkish relations . 
  most of the people wo n't recognise his signature any way same with ottoman coat of arms ... 
  in general people do n't mind kemal . 
  just in greece in general it 's been seen as an [ hubris ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/hubris?wprov=sfla1 ) if you worship past great people and do n't focus on you becoming better than him . 
  we call this '' \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 '' yes we have a word of this . 
  i have even seen cars with ataturks signature going around . 
  you wo n't face racism except golden dawn members but you can tell that folk apart from a mile away . 
  also in general they are a very hated group . 
  some people confuse ataturk with young turks and might accuse him for a genocide or two ... 
  but this is like a big misconception people have . 
  just correct them and move on . 
  a big no no are symbols with grey wolves and mhp . 
  really if we see the hand gesture or the 3 moons we will react very violently because they are seen as a terrorist group . 
  i mean even academics old people anarchist leftist neoliberals will hunt down for you no joke . 
  [ picture of a car with ataturks signature i found recently . 
  i hope you can access imgur . 
  not really ... for example it did n't even have typography till the late 1700 . 
  and after a sultan died the country went into a mini civil war . 
  and even assassinated their not so favorite children . 
  all of sultans dangerous people went farther ahead into the empire so they would have an disadvantage when he died . 
  some pashas were notoriously corrupt like ioannena . 
  there were constant rebelions in every place like that . 
  and thief 's armed gunmen were more common than the civilised folk . 
  after some point it went paste religious fanatism . 
  alchohol prohibition and even killed muslim clergy that tried to contain their madness . 
  big part of the reason the greek revolution was secesful was this . 
  and probably the anatolia region was the worst place to be in the empire . 
  even the aegean side . 
  only after 1900 with trade with england and russia did the region saw development . 
  i have visited but nothing beats berlin ... 
  you can find beef d\u00f6ner and f\u0131st\u0131\u011f\u0131 baklava in greece but not everywhere . 
  you have to search a bit more . 
  like i said get used to pork ... btw was n't s\u00f6zc\u00fc the news paper that before elections published nationalistic articles claiming inhabited greek islands ? 
  edit : yes it is the same newspaper ... now i feel even less bad ... 
  with the way turkey is headed i expect chps mps to be put in jail just like hdp 's . 
  every day this country is headed into becoming ottoman empire 2.0 . 
  good luck to you all kom\u015fu . 
  worst case scenario you migrate to us !, 
  just be ready to get used to pork and bells . 
  for anyone interested here is the main idealist and founder of shorts of this federation : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ioannis_kapodistrias?wprov=sfla1, 
  turkey does not recognize cyprus ... 
  i am not kidding ... 
  / s is there for a reason ... 
  definitely 100 % turkish clay !, 
  greece send settlers there in 2004 ... all aegean belongs to turkic tribes !, 
  what do you mean its in a lake ... its all propaganda !, 
  ** / s ** btw i have been there in an concert its a very beautiful place and a big change from all the beaches and summer heat greece has to offer . 
   in berlin , people would stop walking and give way , look at you while you 're passing in athens they would target you with aks ... 
  whole mafia would mobilize to steal your bike . 
  police would stop you and ask you to not be a danger to society . 
  cars would want you dead . 
  motorbikes want see you as a direct competitor and want to race against you . 
  all that while hearing people call you malaka again and again . 
  and not to mention that you have to carry a 10kg chain through whole km of 60 degrees of inclination with you in order to lock your bike somewhat safely .
