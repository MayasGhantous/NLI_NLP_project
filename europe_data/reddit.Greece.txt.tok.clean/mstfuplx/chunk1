bless you man :d, 
  could you link please ? 
  tsuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu, 
  reeeeeeee, 
  anyone got a complete ranking list of all the countries ? 
  the quote is rubbish . 
  let 's analyze it :  they distrust their government and routinely blame others -- bankers , germans , the second world war -- for their troubles . 
  obviously , he can not possibly criticize the article while viewing this sentence as a counterargument , can he ? 
  where is actually the data that supports such a notion ? 
  no kind of anecdotal evidence gives you the logical necessity to prove such a thing . 
   they never take responsibility for their actions , and never speak well of each other . 
  same with above . 
  where is he basing his claims on ? 
   the greek people have n't figure it out yet : you are where you are because of who you are . 
  better turn to moral philosophy ? 
  what 's the reasoning behind this ? 
   the public looks to the same corrupt leaders who got them into this mess to get them out . 
  who exactly ? 
   the police drink coffee and smoke cigarettes with the rioters and fire-starters . 
  that was a photo taken during a protest . 
  not only is it blown out of proportion but the person next to the policeman was n't proved to be a rioter . 
  also rioter = / = protester . 
  huge difference , right ? 
   i believe i am right in saying that in all of greece , only 5,000 people declare an annual income of 100,000 euros or more . 
  it is routine for doctors to declare incomes of less than 10,000 euros . 
  it is unprecedented , perhaps , in the whole history of the world . 
  an entire nation of cheats . 
  do n't pity a single one . 
  logical fault.the tax evasion of a certain minority does not equal the assertion : `` an entire nation of cheats '' . 
  i do n't even have to write much . 
  the whole quote is one of the most misinformed , irrational and self-wheedling pieces of writing i 've ever read . 
  rofl , not even gon na bother with the ad hominems . 
  i know you are weak in arguing , but that much ? 
  pity :d anyway , please do this so i can officially be the winner : ** declare you are defeated because even though a technicality i would still love to see it written by you . 
   ca n't get away from the fact you know you 'd rather be the tourist ... as i said , you are welcome . 
  please invest in weaker currencies . 
   i laugh because either you 're hitting a stereotype , or you 're from the continent and that 's even worse because i ca n't think of anyone that did n't know the situation that led you into thinking thousands , and not hundreds of thousands . 
  funny how you cling on the numbers . 
  i mentioned the requirements but you are still ignoring them . 
  i still laugh though because you keep addressing my origin . 
  you finally found it though . 
   well first of all , wordsworth , there 's a comma wandering homeless that should be in there somewhere , and the eroteme is missing . 
  i said understanding . 
   ( p.s. ), 
  i 'm playing with the idea that you 're a stereotypical yank . 
  i know you 're greek ... kinda makes the whole economic thing ironic you thieving , conniving bastard , if you think about it . 
   no wonder you 're bitter about strong currencies reaping it in . 
  where i reap ; you bow . 
  bingo , you found it at last after searching a bit ( the nationality that is ) . 
  took you around 3-4 posts . 
  i said you were n't smart . 
  proved me right . 
   come to think of it ... no wonder you 'd rather be the visited than the tourist . 
  it 'd be like a flash back to the good old times !, 
  now that you lost the argument you start the ad hominems . 
  then again that is one the main weapons of the retard 's arsenal . 
  as i said before : ** declare you are defeated because even though a technicality i would still love to see it written by you . 
   then let 's go back to the beginning . 
  the very beginning . 
  one point at a time , i agreed that with a weak currency comes tourism , i just said that i 'd rather be with the comparatively strong currency , with the dispensable income that obviously comes with it , than being the ` mat ' . 
  the serf . 
  the waiter . 
  straight forward enough , but you missed it again :d as i have already mentioned all the answers are in the other posts you have done this a dozen times and i bit and spoon fed you . 
  this is getting awkward . 
    oh , now i know it stung when i said it . 
  was it when i twirled you on whether you were us or continental ? 
  hahaha , again you address my origin but you have no idea . 
  i laugh behind my monitor at your conclusion for it is on par with the rest of your agruments . 
   if you have a latin evolved language i can do this in your native if it helps . 
  ** i 'm english ** i am not sure if you even are english . 
  your understanding of the language is really , really limited . 
  you do not understand an argument in your own language how would you even write in another . 
  if you were being sarcastic then i give it to you . 
  you almost made me laugh , little jester . 
  edit : i like how you shift between conclusions . 
  first i am an american then i am not a european and vice versa . 
  you are funny indeed . 
  ** declare you are defeated because even though a technicality i would still love to see it written by you , agentofstupidity **, 
  sorry mate i wo n't gon na waste more time with you this time . 
  wo n't make the same mistake . 
  i have unmasked you and showed the ignorant , stupid little troll you are . 
  ** stop avoiding my arguments for i have stated them many times . 
  ** ** declare you are defeated because even though a technicality i would still love to see it written by you . 
  ** edit : even your english is so bad . 
  it is evident from this discussion . 
  you are unable to understand an argument . 
  not even a fucking metaphor . 
  please , do n't even bother changing the language because you will embarrass yourself rofl . 
  ( further , duh ) i await you to yield . 
  go on , jester !, 
   why keep saying this when we 're 2 weeks in . 
  of my own design , and we know you 're lying we are still here because you responded to my post . 
  we both know you have a weak little ego but no ability to save it . 
  as i said , i showed you how your preference was based on a false premise . 
  it is there 3 posts ago and the posts before it . 
  i am not going to bother helping you understand again . 
  this is not a charity after all . 
  ** declare ** you are defeated because even though a technicality i would still love to see it written by you . 
  haha , good one . 
  you delivered bullshit again .
