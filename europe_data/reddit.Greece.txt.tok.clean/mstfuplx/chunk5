  there is no cause and effect . 
  wo n't even bother . 
  you fail . 
   did i fail to mention that i 'm back from the uk now ? 
  that 's right . 
  i 'm one of those very people you have tried to argue ca n't capitalise from a stronger currency who is , has , and continues to capitalise on a stronger currency . 
  i made you wait for 2 weeks ; but it was fun watching you argue against even your own points seeing it only from a unipolar perspective . 
  well , you are dillusional as well . 
  you capitalise on a stronger currency ? 
  thanks man , please keep fueling the weaker currencies ' economy . 
  then again , the uk is so expensive you ca n't buy shit there . 
  you wrote so much and yet without content . 
  well , not big a suprise there . 
  so you are still stuck at the first point . 
  haha you are such a failure of a debater . 
  fyi you are still getting massacred . 
   you linked to a paragraph which talked about people struggling to get on the market in the uk . 
  ** that 's not who 's migrating to france , they are people who say for themselves that it is to capitalise on gains on their uk property and the strong pound . 
  ** this makes no sense , my illiterate friend . 
  the article stated that your house prices are rising up . 
  this is a fact . 
  so your whole argument that the stronger currency will buy property easier and hence cause the rise of the prices is not exclusive for the weaker currencies . 
   did n't i just get through saying that they do n't only go to france , but spain and australia amongst other places ? 
  did n't i ? 
  so you admit that you do n't know the specific numbers , right ? 
  then , even if you isolate my statement ( the one about hundrends of thousands ) you still are not right since you are not specific . 
  sadly , even if you were i have repeatedly mentioned why your rationale is so tragically stupid ( demand , supply etc ) . 
   british buyers represent 11 per cent of the market ( after portuguese and french expat buyers ) and although still at ** a low ** level , sales to south africans , australians , new zealanders and ** americans ** are rising , largely due to favourable exchange rates thanks for that , did n't see it . 
  you just added another counter point : `` low '' . 
  hindsight = 0 is n't it ? 
   http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,2039840,00.html from the same article :  back in france , however , housing investors -- especially those in paris -- are still loving life . 
  the reason : price gains in 2010 pushed the median square-foot price in the capital to over $ 650 for the first time ever -- a level that 's set to increase to $ 742 within a year . 
  though it 's difficult to make an accurate comparison with larger and far more diverse housing markets , existing numbers suggest paris is creeping closer to the prices seen in ** notoriously ** expensive london and new york city . 
  but experts warn that is n't necessarily a good thing . 
  more here :  r -- and which will only get tighter until ** both government and developers summon the will , and the finances , to build more homes . 
  ** so this is n't cause and effect . 
  the cause is n't the foreigner 's buying power . 
   http://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/propertyinfrance/cest-la-folie/5093769/property-in-france-are-british-expats-really-leaving-france.html lol at this one . 
  now , it is n't a big suprise really . 
  it comes from the telegraph . 
  cute story but does n't answer shit . 
  you are spamming articles because your argument per se is weak . 
  part of the article  instead , like the british press , they simply quote estate agents who say that les anglais in france have stopped buying , and started selling . 
  you are pathetic . 
   that 's where you click read on and the whole article folds down ... what a tool . 
  you misunderstood me . 
  the article referring to the cause and effect was essentially 6 sentences with no proof . 
  the `` read on '' option expands the page with a bunch of statistics describing the population . 
   not me , the ippr and the expat community at large themselves . 
  they 're the ones saying it !, 
  you 're in the process of arguing with expats as to why they have migrated !, 
  i think they should know why they left or invested overseas !, 
  first i talked about prices and salary . 
  you did n't give me those . 
  secondly , you appeal to anecdotal evidence . 
  tell me how many expats are saying this . 
  n00b  you do n't have a point anymore . 
  you just have bits . 
  i 'm leaving work now for the christmans period , so i 'll catch up making fun off you in the new year . 
  just leave me a little orange to come back to . 
  you truly have just been spanked btw . 
  your case is hopeless . 
  everytime you post and try to mask your ignorance and stupidity with irrelevant links and premises , defunct arguments based on said premises and anecdotal evidence , a few more of my brain cells fade away . 
  you are what the internet subculture would call : a fucktard . 
  merry christmas lol, 
   you just argued that a strong currency does n't give purchasing power in weaker currencies by comparing the pound to the uk !, 
  no i did n't . 
  i linked the article as a reason of why these citizens go out of london or migrate . 
   you say it is because of demand , and yet you 've just been shown that it is ** not the french buying the properties ** . 
  it is a fact of the land that the comparable strength of the pound enabled a middle-class churn , and they 've exploited it to their own ends with trend bucking gains . 
  what ? 
  first of all , the thousands do n't go only to france . 
  in fact the article does n't say where they go . 
  it says to europe . 
  also , do n't be a fucking liar . 
  nowhere did the article say that the french do n't buy property . 
  and lol @ the fucking articles . 
  you link a help resources site . 
  then you link an article which is actually not an article . 
  it is a 6 sentence paragraph with no citations from 2006 . 
  you referred to statistics without citation . 
  you used the word `` fact '' without proof . 
  you typed a big ass post with no content . 
  you did n't address my post but the link i gave you , which had a different goal . 
  you are keep stalling the discussion with bullshit . 
  you are tiring me out . 
   hundred of thousands of brits empowered by the pound you fucking retard . 
  you did n't include prices and the salary . 
  address my point . 
  but that 's not because of the stronger currency , it is because of the demand . 
  new blood comes to the market and buys the houses , dummy . 
  nice try even if it failed . 
  please , keep trying and let me debunk everything you say . 
  you are so funny . 
   the increase in the house prices has made the housing market increasingly difficult to enter . 
  the ratio of lower-quartile house prices to lower-quartile earnings , a measure of affordability used in the barker review of housing supply , rose from 4 in 2000 to 5.2 in 2003 and 7.1 in 2006 . 
  [ 9 ] at a regional level , the problem of unaffordable housing is no longer confined to london and the south east , but now affects almost the whole of england . 
  [ 9 ] in july 2009 the ratio of house prices to first-time buyers ' incomes remained higher than the historical average . 
  [ 10 ] from wikipedia . 
  and in the same post i said how important the factors ( d , s , l.e.
