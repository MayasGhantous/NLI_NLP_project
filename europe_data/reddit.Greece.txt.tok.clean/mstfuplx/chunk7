  i laugh at your attempt to be condescending . 
  yes , i am using your language . 
  interestingly enough , logical thinking depends on the individual 's intelligence , quality you do not , sadly , have . 
  you simply showed the figure . 
  the figure alone shows nothing when the important factors are not included ( demand , supply , salary , local prices and laws ) . 
  i had mentioned those factors in the original post . 
  you , as the deceiving little scum you are , chose not to include them . 
  well done . 
   but you 're the one relying on an argument of stronger currencies investing and moving to weaker currencies and economies to exploit their ** advantage ** . 
  you 're actually arguing my point , beyond 101 you 'd appreciate this . 
  it 's okay , i 'll wait what ? 
   to be clear you just argued that more people bidding on a property does not drive the cost up . 
  you had been arguing that a middle-class migration to weaker currencies did not drive the price up for those already there . 
  you just forgot what you were arguing for the sake of arguing , did n't you ? 
  y u so stupid ? 
  i said that whether the prices drop or rise , depends on a variety of things not just foreign market powers ( in this case foreigners with a stronger currency buying property ) . 
  it depends on the demand , the supply ( if the available property is absorbed by the local economy ) , the salary of the foreigners and the prices . 
  also , it depends on the type of market . 
  please , wake the fuck up . 
  it is the 4th time i mention this but you still insist . 
   that was in response to you saying that it was only the rich moving to a weaker currency to exploit , and to two links provided by me which showed that it was the middle-class exploiting the weaker currency , and a weaker currency professional moving to a stronger currency . 
  the links did not show that the middle class exploits the currency . 
  again read the above answer . 
  also , i said that certain markets like property in wealthy areas are mainly acquired by the rich . 
  you can read , can you ? 
  also , a weaker currency professional does n't make less money necessarily . 
  if let 's say the ratio of the euro to the pound was 2 : 1 , a eurozone citizen making 2000 is making the exact same as the one in the uk who makes 1000 . 
   my cute , little sausage could do this to your ** ignorance ** hole all month . 
  [ haha , oh well ] ( http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v290/eteponge/frequent%20use%20icons/ha_ha_ha_oh_wow.jpg ) it is even more funny when you realise that you are not just ignorant . 
  you are stupid . 
  oh god , you are such a helpless clown . 
  alright , let 's do it once more . 
  maybe you will stop getting destroyed in future debates . 
  if these are your arguing kills , please do n't open your mouth again or you will embarass yourself . 
  off to the points then . 
   when writing and using words i find literal use to be helpful ... that 's tragic . 
  if you can not perceive the meaning of words in a specific context , then you are either stupid or stubborn . 
  nevertheless , you have to do so because then you will see that a premise has a different meaning and hence a different function in an argument ( hint : not a contradiction ) . 
   and i agree but that has nothing to do with what we were arguing . 
  you might want to shoehorn it in as a diversion because you realise you 're on a losing streak , but it 's not going to help . 
  you gave 3 examples , i agreed to all of them , but simply highlighted that you were only seeing it from one angle . 
  you were all for singing the praises of a weaker currency bringing in tourism . 
  i simply pointed out that if the tourists were coming because they had a stronger currency , they also had disposable income , greater ability to travel . 
  but this is not a negative to the currency !, 
  both gain and that 's why it is a symbiotic relationship . 
  you can not still understand that you did n't counterargue . 
  you just stated the obvious . 
  as for the losing streak remark , any chance you share ancenstry with joan of arc ? 
   you really are fond of your schoolboy errors are n't you . 
  if demand goes up prices will go up . 
  if there 's more people bidding , prices will go up . 
  if it is comparably rich foreigners driving up the demand then prices for the natives will be seen to go up significantly as to if the jonny foreigner was n't there . 
  the foreigners with a stronger currency need to come in thousands to affect the prices . 
  also , i explained it to you : a ) it depends on the market ( rich from both countries will not have the problem to buy the house ) b ) depends on the magnitude of the foreign market forces . 
   i think you 're going to find it hard rationalising to any economist that if there are more people bidding on a property that the price does not go up . 
  and this is the basic , super-standard mistake a rookie makes . 
  you just answered instead of me . 
  more people . 
  thank you . 
   well is n't that fortunate !, 
  ` cos there 's hundreds of thousands !, 
  the middle class are leaving to capitalise , immigrants turn up in droves to make for themeselves what they have made . 
  ask any honest frenchman or spaniard how many middleclass brits with young families or pensioners have moved into their countries and changed the property market .

  you posted a link that states that thousands of middle class citizen leave britain to live abroad . 
  that means nothing when you do not show with evidence how it affects the market . 
  what numbers , with what exact ranges , participate in local markets . 
  i underlined in my post the need for demand , supply and prices . 
  you again did n't answer . 
  i will offend you again because you are starting to tire me out with your obviously deceiving demeanour . 
  i am not certain if you do it on purpose or not , though . 
  anyway , again , you lost the point . 
   which is strange because i 'm the only one that has been to show the effects happening right now of what i 'm arguing . 
  nope , as shown above . 
   you 're a squeaky toy and i would rather be a tourist with the money and time to travel , than receive the tourism and for the world to be too expensive . 
  and that 's more proof of your rage inducing ignorance . 
  you 'd rather be a tourist . 
  what ? 
  you 'd rather be spending money in another country , buying products and boosting the economy . 
  thanks man !, 
   why on earth would i want you to back off ? 
  that 's like the butcher wanting the pigs to back off the abattoir !, 
  if only your reasoning was as good as your analogies . 
  that would be magnificent . 
  sadly , it is not the case . 
  see you tommorow , my cute little sausage . 
   it is a symbiotic relationship , you 're just arguing you 'd rather be the weaker one who competes for the wealth of others ( foreign capital ) . 
  fine , i 'd rather have the wealth and the choice . 
  what your brain can not comprehend is that the country with a weaker currency is weak . 
  you are perceive the reality in such a false way that it is disgusting . 
  i never said that the country with a weaker currency is always prosperous . 
  what i did though was to state the obvious consequenses of having a weaker currency . 
  you on the other hand tried , in a completely reactionary manner , changed the subject with the object and used the words `` weaker '' and `` stronger '' with their literally meaning . 
   and i 'm going to go with , where countries with strong currencies currently get their money . 
  i 'm also going to remind you that as your foreign investor , with the strong currency , i own your factories , so if i do need to break off the desirable bits or pass the cost onto you then i will . 
  as already happens with stronger currencies and weaker currencies . 
  this simplistic view is why you can not understand the reality . 
  you do not just break off . 
  you invest in the company and you are bound by that state 's laws . 
  additionally , you are not without risks .
