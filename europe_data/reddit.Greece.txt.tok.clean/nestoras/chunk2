  what else can i say ? 
  ` thank god that the old criminals are ruling again because syriza is populist ' ? 
  the politics of fear have won , once again . 
  have a nice day . 
   yet their actions were n't necessarily criminal . 
  you 're mistaking gut feelings for evidence . 
  evidence has been forthcoming lately . 
  for the first time a [ politician ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=el&amp;u=http://www.inews.gr/200/toulachiston-2-dis-evro-elave-o-a-tsochatzopoulos-se-exoplistikes-mizes.htm&amp;prev=/search%3fq%3d%25cf%2584%25cf%2583%25ce%25bf%25cf%2587%25ce%25b1%25cf%2584%25ce%25b6%25ce%25bf%25cf%2580%25ce%25bf%25cf%2585%25ce%25bb%25ce%25bf%25cf%2582%2b200%2b%25ce%25b4%25ce%25b9%25cf%2582%26hl%3den%26safe%3doff%26prmd%3dimvns&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=v9v2t_a4o8mg0qx_5ii4bw&amp;ved=0cfyq7gewaa ) has been put to jail . 
  estimates as to the amount of money that he received in bribes are close to 2 billion euro , as you can see . 
  do you realize the staggering amount of money that is involved ? 
  by the way , he was * that close * to becoming prime minister a few years ago . 
   that many decisions taken can be deemed immoral by today 's standards does n't mean they were illegal at the time . 
  greece can not afford the instability that invariably follows any politically-minded witch hunts because there are no good outcomes from this scenario . 
  i 'm sorry , i 'm not following you . 
  you seem to be arguing for perpetual impunity . 
  if this is so , what stops current day or future politicians from doing the same ? 
   angry people are well known for their ability to make rational decisions . 
  no , they are not . 
  of course they are known for making * irrational * decisions . 
  that 's the whole * point * of anger . 
  some very learned people posit that this is why anger evolved as a feeling : it serves as a sort of mad device , a guarantee that * even though it would be irrational for me to fight you back , i will do so with all my strength , without calculating the consequences * . 
  my anger guarantees that to you . 
  this serves to make offenders think twice before offending , even when they know that they are stronger . 
  it impresses me how easily you discount the fact that criminals must pay , in the name of some sort of perceived ` stability ' . 
  you seem to think that there are no criminals , only ` scapegoats ' . 
  i agree . 
  it 's just that some have more sinking to do than others , if you get my drift . 
  new democracy voters felt that their money is safe now . 
   unrealistic . 
  the country would be paralyzed for many years while an immensely expensive army of accountants goes to town on over 30 years ' worth of budgets in minute detail . 
  paralyzed ? 
  i 'm sorry , but you have n't fully grasped the conditions on the ground for over half the greek population * now * ( unofficial unemployment  30 % ) . 
  go tell them that ` well , the country will be paralyzed while we will be searching for the culprits and the true amount of what you owe ... that 's too much trouble , let 's just pay a few hundred billion dollars , ok ? 
  there you go , chop chop !, 
  oh , and do n't mind the insults from the other europeans calling you a lazy thief , neither the people with the big houses , the expensive cars and the villas in the islands while you are searching the garbage for food ' and see their reaction . 
   you 're describing a revenge fantasy . 
  if there 's an indication of criminal activity , it should be investigated . 
  indication ? 
  indication ? 
  there has been nothing but ` indications ' for the last 40 years , but the people in charge wo n't put themselves in jail , can you believe the nerve ? 
  oh , and before you mention democracy , the elections , etc. 
  etc. , the other people are exactly the same , too . 
  for the first time in living memory the greeks had a chance to vote for somebody untainted ( syriza ) , a political phenomenon that rose from 4 % to 26 % due to all the anger of the greek people and on the small hope that those at least will be honest , and the rest of europe unleashed an unprecedented propaganda of fud against them . 
  the same old assclowns won ( the rich overpowered the poor ) and suddenly ` greece is stabilized ' and ` pro-europe ' . 
  yeah , right . 
   but a drive to find scapegoats and nail them by any means necessary in search of absolution is silly . 
  i 'm sorry but your last sentence is just out of place . 
  i ca n't even begin to answer it . 
  come live in greece for a while . 
  why did you buy an apple in the first place ? 
  how much did the apple cost and how much did you pay ? 
  where are the receipts ? 
  whom did you buy it from and why him ? 
  the debt started accumulating from the 1980 's , it 's not a matter of ` which month ' . 
  believe me , the stink that will come out will put half of this country 's politicians in jail ( and that 's a conservative estimate ) . 
  wow , thanks for actually asking !, 
  * full and complete analysis by an independent committee of what greece owes , to whom and why . 
  the study should cover all loans taken by the greek state from 1974 to the present day . 
  complete breakdown of the total debt ; how much is capital , how much is interest . 
  full disclosure of how all this money has been used ( very important ) , as well as who authorized these loans and under what conditions ( very important ) . 
  separate legal debt that will be paid back in full from odious , illegal debt that will not be recognized and will serve to start judicial procedures against the perpetrators ( i.e. 
  greek officials as far as greece is concerned ) . 
  this is a demand raised by many . 
  * extension of the time allocated to repay the public debt , at a low rate , with no new borrowing in conjunction with a development plan for the economy . 
  structural and governmental reforms should also happen during this time . 
  once again , thank you for asking me . 
  hehehe just like me with feta cheese then !, 
  the vast majority of the so-called ` bailout ' is used to pay back capital * plus * interest ( i.e. 
  profit ) on previous loans , accumulating more debt in the meantime . 
  a very small percentage ( < 10 % ) is used for the country 's needs such as public service salaries . 
  i hope you know this . 
   500 $ in greece is equivalent to 500 $ in slovakia is equivalent to 500 $ in finland - they are worth the same - it is the same currency no . 
  they represent buying power , which you can use to buy things . 
  things that are being sold * at different prices * in different countries and thus require ... wait for it ... wait for it ... * more buying power * in some countries than others . 
  see how much ` living ' your 500 euros buy you in new york or london and then try africa . 
   of course if our virtual finn decides to only eat in mcd , he or she wo n't eat everyday , but if he/she buys food and cooks it , he/she will have enough spare money to afford a cell phone service and go to the uff to get second hand clothes . 
  this is your strawman argument . 
  just to make sure i understand you correctly : all of the homeless or unemployed people in greece who ca n't provide for their children are desperate because the thought that they can cook their own food never occurred to them , right ? 
  try to understand this : cooking your very own food in greece is much more expensive than cooking your very own food in estonia ( for example ) . 
  the exact same food . 
  that 's a fact . 
  if you are curious about prices and you want to compare to your country , check [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/vppwj/now_seven_out_of_ten_greeks_under_the_poverty_line/c56siio ) out . 
  if you know how to fix this , please inform the rest of the world . 
  nobody is talking about eating at mcdonalds . 
  also , the 250 euro rent for a house including heating and water bills ( heating in the winter ? 
  really ? ), 
  is a joke . 
   500 $ is 500 $ everywhere , how you consume it is up to you , and you consume it solves on how much you will get in exchange of your 500 $ . 
  please try to understand . 
   ~ ~ this money is used to save the `` proud nation of greece '' ~ ~ this money is used to bail out rich investment bankers and pay back their expected profits from their bad loans there , fixed that for you . 
  a poor greek who has n't even seen a sliver ( like most ) of that supposed ` rescue ' money . 
   we belong to europe only in a geographical sense  we just do n't care very much about europe , it 's a marriage of convenience for us and we 're starting to think it would be simpler for all involved to just get a divorce i 've studied a few years in the uk along with other greek students . 
  we 've made friends ( some of them close ) and talked to many british young men and women while there . 
  one thing that surprised us was the way you brits view your country . 
  in anybody else 's mind , there are the superpowers ( usa , china , perhaps the ussr in the past ) on one end , the smaller countries on the other ( greece , portugal , denmark , austria , the scandinavians , etc. ), 
  and the well-off middle-sized ` normal ' countries in the middle ( france , spain , italy , the uk , and of course germany leading the pack which was obvious even back in the '90s ) . 
  to our surprise , we discovered that the brits put their country on the top shelf , along with usa and china . 
  a very good english friend had once asked me ` so , which one do you think has the biggest influence on world events , the us or the uk ? ' . 
  his question was in earnest . 
  in my mind , this is the real reason for your attitude towards europe .
