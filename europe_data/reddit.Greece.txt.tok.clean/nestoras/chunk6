  you sound as if this is something easily found in greek politicians ... 
  the greeks are shouting : ` do n't worry guys , we 've got this . 
  we 'll throw you all a line and tow you back to safety in a minute ! ', 
  i was talking about the [ ` lisp ' ] ( http://spanish.about.com/cs/qa/a/q_lisp.htm ) . 
  i was being curious about which form or pronunciation ( ` th ' vs. 's ' ) is more popular/correct . 
  how do people that talk with the ` lisp ' sound to the rest and vice versa . 
  well , i do n't know how to describe it ... perhaps ` singy ' is not the correct word . 
  ` curvy ' might be a better one . 
  perhaps everyone hears their own language as ` flat ' and everything else as ` curvy ' . 
  the 'n' at the end of words is more distinctive though . 
  of course it sounds like ` tsair ' !, 
   as you know , there are no ` ch ' or ` sh ' sounds in modern greek . 
  by that , i mean that they can not be written down , either as a single letter or as a combination of many letters . 
  the closest ones are ` ts ' and 's ' . 
  now , this is very important to a greek speaker , because greek is an entirely phonetic language . 
  if it ca n't be written down , it does n't exist . 
  you can try to pronounce it , * but it 's not a proper part of the language * . 
  you ca n't direct the reader ` here , pronounce this part as ch , not as ts ' . 
  this will have to be done by memory ( i.e. 
  you remember that this is how it 's supposed to be pronounced and ignore what you see written down ) . 
  one that always puzzled us greek students when we were in the uk was this : if you want to say ` lester ' , why do you write ` leicester ' ? 
  if you want to say ` kernel ' , why do you write ` colonel ' ? 
  of course cypriots are much better at speaking english than mainland greeks !, 
  as a response to your tip , ask a cypriot to write down ` chair ' in greek so that it can be pronounced correctly :p here 's a very interesting [ summary ] ( http://www.unilang.org/viewtopic.php?f=52&amp;t=31115 ) from a cypriot . 
  * british english : many tonal variations , the deep ` sh ' sound ( e.g. 
  ` posh ' ) is dominant . 
  greek does not make a distinction between deep and shallow ` sh ' , so it 's the first thing a greek speaker notices on a british voice . 
  short , sharp peaks in pronunciation . 
  can sound pretentious but also authoritative . 
  * american english : flat , quick , simplified . 
  no-nonsense . 
  much easier to comprehend for greek ears . 
  * spanish : very similar to greek . 
  you can practically hear the mediterranean sea in them . 
  they sound very sexy when spoken by a female voice ( male voices sound ` brotherly ' to me ) . 
  * italian : much like spanish , only with a bit more melody ( spanish sounds more flat , like my native language ) . 
  also , a language that seems designed to make it easy to keep speaking and speaking  * cypriot greek : come on guys , you 're doing it on purpose !, 
  stop singing !, 
   * russian : deep , very heavy accent . 
  those guys know how to roll their ` r 's ( i 'm looking at you france ) . 
  * german : sounds harsh , angry . 
  too many consonants , a language to command into . 
  * french : very smooth , a bit effeminate , even when spoken by deep-voiced males . 
  no ` r 's . 
  cultured , sophisticated , aloof . 
  i 'm sorry if i offended anybody . 
  all languages are very interesting to hear !, 
  you 're right , we all tend to adapt to the way our people around us speak . 
  cypriot people here speak much closer to our local dialect . 
  we also get \u03a1\u0399\u039a on tv and there 's certainly a difference . 
  although i must take the opportunity to say , you should n't be posting photos of gyros in the middle of the night . 
  some of us are on a diet , thank you very much !, 
  i think this applies to most mediterranean people . 
  edit : changed ` all ' to ` most ' . 
  i 've just done a search on a possible relation between greek and spanish . 
  you 're right , they are only very indirectly related ( they have exchanged some words through latin ) , but their phonemic dictionaries are almost the same , making one sound like the other . 
  there was this comment by this spanish guy who said the exact same thing as you : he was listening to the news in greek on tv and the experience was very strange to him , because it was like listening to spanish that he could n't understand . 
  anyway , i 've got this question i always wanted to ask a spaniard ( i hope you 're not offended !, 
  ) : what 's up with the ` th/s ' sound ? 
  i 've heard spanish words pronounced both ways . 
  which one is correct ? . 
  is there a historical reason for this ? 
   greek ( edit ) . 
  i find weird how similar it sounds to spanish , sometimes . 
  exactly !, 
  we have the same accents and the same ` sound profile ' . 
  i always thought that a spaniard could easily pass for a native greek speaker with very little effort , much like a greek could pass as a native spanish speaker . 
  this is very difficult ( for us ) to do with british english , for example . 
  i think italian is also pretty close to greek , although not as much as spanish is ( it 's too melodic ) . 
  ninja edit : when i was studying in the uk , i 've noticed how similar we tend to look . 
  i could very , very easily identify another greek person on the street , except if he/she turned out to be spanish !, 
  there was simply no way to differentiate between a greek and a spaniard based on their appearance , until they spoke . 
  i do n't think that the cypriot dialect is that hard to understand , especially compared to some others out there ( even old-school cretan for example is manageable , but the [ pontic dialect ] ( http://pontosworld.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=776&amp;itemid=75 ) can be incomprehensible ; almost a different language ) . 
  cypriot is quite easy , it just sounds a bit too melodic to greek ears ( much like italian for example ) . 
  plus , our cypriot brothers and sisters tend to append an 'n' character at the end of each word . 
  at least that 's how us mainland greeks speak when we are making fun of them  . 
  `` res tells me that i 've given you 13 upvotes so far , keep going ! '', 
  but , but ... aliens !, 
  i 'm old enough to know that people can * really * ( instead of superficially ) understand and appreciate a situation only when it affects them directly . 
  all of us are prejudiced and biased . 
  that 's how the human brain works , really . 
  to the people that downvoted , i 'm just a lazy greek that over-borrowed and lived the good life and now wants to get off scot-free . 
  they have this image of me , this image of you , this image of greece in their minds and nothing will make them change it short of having them magically transported to greece a few years in the past and making them live the life of an average greek through the crisis . 
  it 's exactly how austerity in greece is going for the past half decade . 
  all the way to the crumbling infrastructure , ` stop aging ' and ` that 's all you can afford to do ' parts . 
  / sincere, 
   there must have been thousands upon thousands of people who knew that this was not only wrong , but also unsustainable . 
  and yet nobody did anything . 
  yes , there must have been . 
  let 's break them down : 1 . 
  greek politicians : yes , some of them knew greece is over-borrowing and over-spending . 
  too entrenched in party politics , power struggles and one-upping the other party to do anything about it . 
  nobody wants to be the guy who will ` get the snake out of the hole ' , as the greek saying goes . 
  some of the most honest ( and technically minded , because most of them are simply incompetent ) ones did secretly notify the prime minister ( these things are sensitive ) that things are not going well ( after the olympics ) . 
  this became known later . 
  the prime minister did not act or did too little too late , for various reasons . 
  summary : self-serving party interests . 
  foreign politicians , imf , ecb , lending banks : they must have surely known . 
  why did they not do anything ? 
  i do not know .
