i am surprised he did n't just get `` disappeared '' like in soviet times, 
  fair enough but the only reason i think there is potential for positive growth is because i believe the economy reached `` bottom '' in 2013 after 5 straight years of depression which cut the economy by almost 30 % ( unheard of ) . 
  i think its nearly impossible for it to get any worse so my `` optimism '' is based on `` it cant possibly get worse '', 
  like i said , the only way that 4 % growth is happening is with gas/shipping/tourism boosting the economy , so provided links . 
  i personally do n't think it will be 4 % in 2016 , maybe 1 % in 2015 and 2 % in 2016, 
  did you read my previous comment ? 
  `` i will believe it ( 4 % growth ) when i see it '', 
  the growth rate in op 's pic is nearly 4 % in 2016 , is that something i lied about also ? 
  gas/pipeline/shipping / tourism boosting the economy is the only way that 4 % growth is happening so i provided links to give more info . 
  apology accepted, 
  my last two submissions are n't those . 
  do you mean my last two islamic related submissions that got downvoted like crazy within minutes ? 
  i will keep this up , but the only reason i deleted those two was because they apparently broke `` rules '' of this subreddit . 
  the economy bottomed out in 2013 and is now stabilizing with growth expected for at least the next decade ( as you can see in op 's graph ) the bottoming out process from 2008-2013 was most dangerous/pessimisstic period but there is a renewed confidence from [ international market ] ( http://online.wsj.com/articles/s-p-upgrades-greece-rating-1410537206 ) s and [ foreign investors ] ( http://www.thetoc.gr/eng/economy/article/investments-worth-37-billion-in-two-years ) right now i am most excited about gas/pipeline prospects for greece , dozens of blocks are being readied for drilling , [ one block started last week valued at 14 billion euros ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/11/01/hydrocarbons-in-gulf-of-patras-evaluated-at-14-bln-euros/ ) , with tap pipeline beginning construction within 12 months . 
  also tons of chinese-greek shipping deals being made , tourism in on record high 3 years in a row and growing . 
  i am a mix of pessimistic and optimist , pessimist because bad news is the norm and i always expect some horrible thing to happen to greece/eu countries but a bit more optimistic now for next decade . 
  greece/ireland with largest predicted growth in 2016 . 
  that is interesting but i will believe it when i see it .

  pasok socialist party that led greece from 80 's -2008 is the main reason greece nearly imploded . 
  this is the only reason i am against syriza as they are also socialist , the only positive thing about syriza is that they are a young party and know the mistakes of pasok . 
  i 've explained this to you before but i will try again the gas drilling + pipeline construction which is taking off in greece will not make greece into dubai ( at least not any time in next 20-30 years ) what it will do though is increase `` confidence '' of international markets in greece , it will also increase greece 's political clout in the eu as they have potential to replace russia as energy hub for eu market . 
  the best thing this gas drilling/pipelines will do in short-term ( 10-20 years ) is that it will bring other forms of investment as confidence grows it will create a snow-ball effect . 
  you keep putting words in my mouth that i think greece will be like dubai over-night or something, 
  the difference is that greece fulfills and exceeds its nato requirements [ this is just from today ] ( http://en.protothema.gr/nato-secretary-general-thanks-greeks-for-support/ ) ** nato secretary general jens stoltenberg thanked greece for its support to the alliance during his visit to athens on thursday **  nato secretary general jens stoltenberg thanked greece for its unwavering support to the alliance during a visit to athens on thursday . 
  `` we thank you for all the contributions you make to our shared security , '' the secretary general said . 
  `` this commitment has been sustained despite difficult times . 
  throughout , greece has remained an active and effective member of our alliance and for over 60 years , nato has been committed to keeping greece safe . ''   together with greek defence minister dimitrios avramopoulos , the secretary general also visited the greek frigate hns salamis to observe a regular joint exercise which demonstrated maritime and rapid reaction capabilities that greece has deployed in missions like the nato counter-terrorism active endeavour operation in the mediterranean .

  [ meanwhile greece accumulated almost 38 billion in foreign investment the last year ] ( http://www.thetoc.gr/eng/economy/article/investments-worth-37-billion-in-two-years ) greece is ranked low because the government refused to sell the entire country for pennies on the dollar which the troika was not to happy about . 
  if pakistani 's and other islamic immigrants in uk had only just arrived in the last decade , you would make a good point . 
  as when the greeks/italians first arrived in mass around early 1900 's the native anglo/germanic had misconceptions about them . 
  but after 20-30 years they perfectly assimilated into the local culture and became just as `` american '' as anyone else . 
  pakistani 's have been in uk [ on mass for over 70 years now ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_pakistanis ) and also from other islamic countries . 
  yet you hear almost daily about mass organized rapes , murders , sharia zones , `` no-go '' zones for police/firemen due to hostile islamic immigrants and other crazy shit . 
  they have failed in assimilating and are creating a [ parallel society ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pszbaju_cvo ) next to the british one . 
  do you see the difference ? 
  i am sure you wo n't since kke idiots like you would rather see the idea of nations and ethnicity destroyed for the `` greater good '' . 
  there is a difference between isolated crimes and organized rape of 1,400 girls . 
  i know well of issues greeks/italians/spaniards had in late 1800 's / early 1900 's as immigrants , if you can find an example of organized rape of 1,400 youths in america than i will see your point better .

  the results are not only a major boost for the local credit sector , but also for the government as they allow it to handle the reserves of about 11.3 billion euros at the hellenic financial stability fund for alternative purposes , such as the reduction of the national debt . 
  piraeus bank showed capital needs of 660 million euros according to the data up to december 31 , 2013 , but the restructuring plan that the bank has submitted and partly implemented already cover all of its needs , according to reuters . 
  national bank announced that its capital needs based on its static picture ( end-2013 data ) amounted to 3.43 billion euros , but its plan on restructuring its assets and operations has diminished its requirements to just 273.28 million euros . 
  this will likely be covered by the sale of shares in finansbank , national 's turkish subsidiary . 
  eurobank announced that its original deficit , calculated using the end-december 2013 picture , came to 4.63 billion euros , but following its share capital increase of 2.86 billion euros and the restructuring plan submitted , its requirements amount to no more than 17.55 million euros .

  it just means `` land of the ionians '' ionians were one of the early greek tribes which settled in athens region, 
  it would be funny to also use fopo * of fyrom but they did not exist during this time and were just bulgarians, 
  the nordics of byzantine era called constantinople and its territories as the greek kingdom http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/varangian_guard nordic people were the main mercenary force of the byzantines and i read recently that lots of nordic people have greek origin names from this cultural exchange period . 
  hellene had the stigma of being associated with pagan greeks who were still active in greece up until 1,000 ad ( hellenes of laconia ) roman meant you were christian , in the end it had nothing to do with ethnicity but religious affiliation . 
  yup , yunan means ionian , one of the ancient greek tribes and ancestors to ancient athenians so `` land of the ionians '', 
  norwegians are bro 's i also heard italians/spaniards also use `` ellada '' for greece , is this true ? 
  and then the greeks became romans again ( byzantine empire ) its a bit more complicated though since byzantine was known by nordics/west euro 's as the `` greek kingdom '' but the greeks called themselves `` new rome '' in official aspects of the kingdom, 
  alexander the great stated that he did this due to the persians burning down the acropolis , still fucked up but at least theres the greek side . 
  modern acropolis is the re-built version built after it was burned down, 
  calling people racist has lost all meaning , [ do n't even care ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yyhvhgr.jpg ), 
  i think that is just a scummy way to go about it , is all . 
  athens was a ghost town during the ottoman empire period , with less than 1-2 ,000 greek residents . 
  the majority of greeks had fled to the greek islands and mountains/rough terrain of southern greece where they continued to fight the `` legitimate government of greece '' and they had no say in this purchase . 
  if greek representative was part of this purchase and agreed that the marbles would be safe outside the country i would not debate this . 
  the fact is that the greeks had no part or say in this `` legitimate '' purchase of greek history . 
  lets say germany defeated uk in ww1 , and they became the `` legitimate '' government of uk . 
  how would you feel if the germans sold the royal jewel 's and other artifacts to italy while they were the `` legitimate '' government . 
  and then after germans were removed the british people asked the italians for the jewels back . 
  and then forever all you hear the italians say is `` but we saved them from destruction !, 
  '' , `` we bought them from legitimate government ! '', 
  `` we will keep them safe ! '' . 
  i bet you would be singing a different tune , 
  did you watch stephen fry 's video i linked ? 
  he explains the `` pro-return '' side perfectly and clearly . 
  if you did save the marbles from destruction that is great , true or not that is not really the point . 
  the fact is that you can return the marbles to the new state of the art athens acropolis museum which was built in reaction of english claims that the marbles would not be safe in greece . 
  also greeks are not raised to think of `` evil brits '' . 
  where in the hell did you hear that nonsense ? 
  it 's not like greeks and uk tourists are getting into knife fights over greek marbles debates, 
  seriously ? 
  he stole the marbles once the greek independence war begun , and he made this `` deal '' with the occupiers and not the greeks . 
  your point about `` saving '' the marbles would make sense if not for the fact that the remaining marbles/artifacts/etc in greece are in better condition than the ones in england . 
  you stole the marbles , do n't bullshit with false moralism like you did greece a favor . 
  [ stephen fry had a brilliant debate where he was in favor of returning the marbles ] ( http://youtu.be/fmosr7zxalk?t=10m37s ) , i do not blame english people for stealing the marbles , but i really hate the false moralism of those like you who defend the theft .
