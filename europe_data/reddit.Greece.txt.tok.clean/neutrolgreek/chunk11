  we are the 110 % pure descendants of macedonians !, 
  greeks are trying to steal our history !, 
  death to the greeks !! '', 
  do you see where the problem lies ? 
  look at the map , fyrom is located in ancient thrace , outside of makedon borders . 
  the area now known as fyrom was the location of the thracian heartland for thousands of years , the thracians were the enemies of greeks for thousands of years . 
  the people of fyrom have absolutely nothing to do with ancient macedonia , the makedons ceased to exist in 148 bc alongside the spartans and athenians . 
  after 148 bc the greek city-states merged together during roman occupation and by the time rome fell around 300/400 ad , the new greeks had no city-state affiliation like their ancestors and instead worked as a common single ethnicity and created the byzantine empire . 
  not even during the damn balkan wars 1 and 2 did this `` fyrom '' exist . 
  you would think that if such a minority existed in the exact place this war took place they would have been known , or am i wrong ? 
  fyrom is a product of soviet propaganda , the goal of fyrom was to brainwash a bulgarian/albanian population into believing a false history and lay claims to greek lands which would then go to war with each other . 
  the soviets have always wanted a mediteranean port and they saw an opportunity to gain thessaloniki harbor , but only if they created a tension and reason for war with greece . 
  this is why i will never support russia and their bullshit `` orthodox brotherhood '' garbage , very few countries have backstabbed greece as much as fucking russians , i will never support them and the mess they created north of greece, 
  your point of alexander the first is a common fyrom argument . 
  you leave out the part that during this time makedon was nothing more than a backwards shithole up in the north of greece with little culture/military history compared to the great sparta/athens who viewed themselves as the rightful owners of greece . 
  alexander the first was put through a `` show trial '' to see how truly `` greek '' he was and the judgement of the court was that not only was he greek , he was the surviving descendant of hercules . 
  athens/sparta/makedon viewed each other as enemies , it always makes me laugh how fyrom ` ians like yourself will bring up arguyments like makedon and athens were at war !, 
  no shit , athens and sparta were at war with each other for pretty much 500 years non-stop . 
  such incredible ignorance in a post first , fyrom has nothing to do with ancient macedonia , [ ancient makedon is entirely within modern greek borders ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/expansionofmacedon.jpg ) and the ancient macedonians were a greek kingdom that united the greek city-states for hundreds of years against the romans until the fall of makedon in 148 bc . 
  the [ `` hellenic age '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hellenistic_period ) is the period between alexander the great 's death to the fall of makedon in 148 bc . 
  literally 2,000 years later `` fyrom '' popped out of nowhere into existance . 
  there was no such thing as `` fyrom '' in byzantine era , or even the damn balkan wars which took place 50 years before fyrom was created . 
  there has never been a `` macedonian '' minority in greece , ever . 
  also `` greeks not that pure themselves '' , for the most part not much as changed since byzantine times . 
  [ 70 % of greek dna is from j2/e3b greek mediterannean haplogroups with the remainder 30 % being a mix of italic/slavic/french / spanish haplogroups . 
  ] ( https://img.4plebs.org/boards/pol/image/1385/74/1385745361891.png ) also the problem with fyrom is their anti-greek propaganda which is basically what their entire `` identity '' is based on , and the fact they claim greek lands as their own .

  the `` uncle/cousin '' public sector handout jobs were a major problem for sure , but that is not possible any more after troika/greek government fired hundreds of thousands of public sector workers . 
  [ the remaining public workers are now part of a new `` evaluation system '' and are graded on a scale ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/01/15/new-evaluation-method-for-public-sector-employees/ )  any civil servant with a low score on the evaluation test will be in danger of labor mobility or even exit from the public sector in general . 
    from now on , evaluators will not only judge the performance and achievements of each employee , they will also take into account the possibility they have of excelling in their work environment . 
  essentially through these new regulations there will be specific quotas for the respective rating scales where employees will be categorized according to their evaluation . 
  he brought the bonds because his staff of 100 + people at japonica investment worked for over 2 years to predict which way the greek economy was heading and they internally predicted it would rise significantly .

  i did not post links from `` rt '' eu observer a respected source now , greece still has horrible un-employment numbers , i hope this is the main focus of the greek government for the next 5-10 years .
