  the eu fund portion could be paid back from money gained by operating the trains, 
  us does not trust germany and vice versa , always has been the case and always will be the case . 
  this is why usa is grooming poland to be a regional super-power and why eu is pumping 400 billion euros in aid to build up poland into a regional economic power . 
  for americans , poland is the ideal european ally and they have a long history of trust to work off of and it goes both ways . 
  i am pretty sure besides uk , poland is considered america 's greatest european ally , which makes sense . 
  poland will be the key to america 's european strategy for the next century ( between russia and germany ) , good news for poland as they will become a very powerful country in europe .

  there should be a eu project to do this every country puts in 50 % of the money required to build the rail network within their own country , a eu fund provides the other 50 % it would be amazing to take a train from athens to london !,

  the future of eu military is the recently formed [ `` drone club '' ] ( http://euobserver.com/defence/122167 ) between greece , germany , poland , france , italy , spain , netherlands this program will create a next-generation fighter drone by 2020 and the eu will be capable of arming themselves with the largest fighter drone fleet on earth . 
  drones are the future of warfare , at least for the next century and the eu will soon be on the cutting edge of this technology, 
  well eu gave poland nearly 400 billion dollars in funds to build up east poland , same came be done for ukraine, 
  best old city in greece for me is [ palia poli \\ ( old city \\ ) in rhodes ] ( http://joysofjordan.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dsc_0269.jpg ) built by knights templar after being expelled from jerusalem , thousands still live within the walls and some of the best bars/nightclubs/boutique stores in the dodecanese are there, 
   there are two possible scenarios on who was buried in the tomb :   the first is that the tomb belongs to the wife of alexander the great , roxanne , and his son , alexander the 4th . 
  according to archaeologists , the date of the surrounding peribolos coincides with the period during which great historical events took place in the area of amphipolis . 
  alexander the 4th ( 323-311 bc ) was heir to the throne of macedonia as he would be the king after his father 's death . 
  however , he was arrested and kept prisoner in amphipolis under general kassandros ' orders . 
  he was later murdered at the age of 12 along with his mother . 
    the second scenario is that the tomb belongs to an important military figure of the time . 
  archaeologists base this scenario on the fact that many generals and admirals of alexander 's army lived in the area of amphipolis , and some of them were killed on site . 
  i know merkel is powerful , but she is not the holy roman emperor .

  greece has the largest tank force in europe and 3rd on earth . 
  just participated in largest air force exercise in history with israel and greek pilots have the most reaction time training due to 100 + responses to turk incursions into greece every month . 
  400 billion in 30 years on spending which bankrupted us ... greek army is not rated high because it is not used to invade 3rd world shitholes . 
  if a time ever comes to defend europe ... poland and greece will be the key to success . 
  poland received nearly 320 billion in eu funds . 
  but they did n't call it a bailout to manufacture anti-polish feelings . 
  i think the main reason russia targets europe fruit & vegetables in sanctions is because it would destroy any chance of ukraine recovery . 
  ukraine 's west main industry is food production while in the east it is industrial/military production . 
  with the sanctions against european fruit/veggie vendors it has now created a massive issue of to much food production in europe , whereas previously ukraine goods could have filled this market , eu will have to instead assist eu countries in selling the surplus of food/veggies from within eu . 
  and this is on top of east ukraine industry possibly completely destroyed in this war , i have no idea how ukraine cal climb out of this crisis .

  politically the greek aristocracy continued the roman way of doing things but after rome fell , there was no roman empire within modern day italian borders near the city of rome . 
  after rome the city fell , the ideology of rome continued within greek borders with greek people continuing the traditions that was built during the roman empire . 
  roman ethnic ( italic ) people were not in control of byzantine , it was ethnic greeks who continued the roman traditions and made a few changes like adopting greek as the official language and orthodoxy as the official religion . 
   even the word `` byzantium '' is latin , as in greek it was `` byzantion '' this makes no sense , byzantine the city existed a thousand years before rome even existed . 
  the way you spell it in english has no relevance . 
   byzantine empire took much from greece , but politically it was rome . 
  byzantine was a fully greek empire with roman politics , that is the textbook definition of the byzantine empire . 
  romans , as in the ethnic people of rome played no role in byzantine empire . 
  byzantine was greek , greece to byzantine empire was what russia was to soviet union . 
  byzantine was not an ethnicity/people , byzantine was the name of a greek city which was renamed to constantinople after the greeks took control of the eastern roman empire after greece became a superpower when rome fell , the official language of the byzantine empire became greek , religion greek christian orthodox , and military/economic power was centered around greece .

  [ telegraph - white britons to become minority by 2066 ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/8142176/white-britons-to-become-minority-by-2066.html ) that article is also optimistic that it wont happen earlier considering immigration is going to exponentially increase and the fact that non-native british have almost 3-4x the birth-rates of natives . 
  by 2040 native british will be hovering around 45-55 % of the population in their own country and soon after a minority . 
   why would it matter that their native population would be a minority is n't it funny how only europe has to deal with this mindset ? 
  why would it matter if south africans were a minority and whites majority !, 
  i would love to see the shitstorm if you said that in public yet it is ok for northern european natives to face extinction northern europe is fucked, 
  yes , wait until uk/french are a minority in their own countries by 2040-2050 .

  i posted an article this week that was interesting greek researches found a wine cup in a tomb which was found during a contruction project . 
  to their surprise the wine cup had the names of pericles , the founder of the athenian golden age ( 450 bc ) and his brother who had a very rare name . 
  the wine cup was part of an ancient ceremony where you would etch your name into the cup , the fact that it dates back to this time period and it has pericles and his brothers name etched in it , makes this a very exciting find . 
  pssibly the find of the decade in greece, 
  yes , jizya tax is part of the islamic state, 
  are these the `` germans '' everyone is bitching about ? 
  this flag represents the ideology that uk/netherlands and all of europe will be under the black flag of islamic rule . 
  this is not a `` group '' , it is an ideology of dominance and submission to islam . 
  they kill anyone who is shia and offer to christians a choice between conversion or taxation to keep their religion . 
  also not everyone enjoys watching islamic jihadist propaganda like you , fucking savage . 
  the hellenic age which is defined by the death of alexander the great to the fall of makedon in 148 bc to rome . 
  during the hellenic age , the makedon monarchy united all the greeks in four epic wars against rome , with the fourth being the final blow to free greece . 
  after the fall of makedon , there was a period of instability known as the roman civil war which lasted around 50 years , but after that rome brought a great era of peace and prosperity to greece . 
  it helped that romans and greeks saw themselves as equals and basically one race although the romans disliked the `` pleasure obsessed '' greeks , 
  600 years ? 
  200 ( islands ) -300 ( mainland ) years was the total occupation of greece , some balkan countries were 500-600 years also intermarrying of christian greeks/slavs and muslim turks could only produce islamic children under ottoman law .
