  many did this to avoid the jizya tax ( religious tax ) and to take advantage of the ottoman empire 's benefits modern greeks are descendants of greek christian orthodox enclaves who spent all their wealth for 200-300 years to keep their religion/communities and lived a harsh life . 
  it is a very sensitive issue . 
   if you do n't drink then people will think you are evil and plotting against them . 
  greeks are like that but with food also never ever decline food at a greek persons house , even if you are full .

  good job , hope you got some nice shiny shekels for that, 
  it is really hard to help people that believe raping babies will cure them of aids . 
  i do not really see what europe can possibly do without being seen as the enemy in that region . 
  turkey/saudis could fix it up possibly, 
  each island in greece is its own madagascar , cant fuck with that, 
  you had a good run uk, 
  considering rabbi 's have preached that non-jews are nothing more than cattle to be used as slaves and killing non-jews for their organs is kosher , i am not really surprised by this statement about `` expensive blood '', 
  or because most europeans do n't need the surgery  then again this does not necessarily mean germans are mainly getting this surgery , greece has high quality and affordable plastic surgery operations so people from around the world come to greece to get their surgeries + recover afterwards . 
  it could just be that the best penis surgery doctors are in germany so you have people from around the world flooding there to get it done . 
  could be the 500 bc era athenians were using this tomb also . 
  it would have been around 400 years old by then , it managed to keep all those artifacts secure for thousands of years which shows the quality of the structure, 
  or greece which has a very high english proficiency just below the nordic countries . 
  main reason is that greek dubs of english language tv/movies does not exist . 
  well they said there are not neo-nazi groups fighting for ukraine but there are literally dozens of videos of neo-nazi militia groups in kiev taking their oaths under nazi flags and doing the hitler salute . 
  just google azov battalion which has neo-nazi 's from around europe fighting for them also, 
  removing russian troops from estonia would be possible . 
  taking down moscow would be impossible even with the full force of nato moscow is said to have over 400 + s-300 / s-400 / s-500 units completely surrounding moscow in a giant ring . 
  no stealth jet can bypass this . 
  it would have to be a pure ground invasion into moscow and i do n't think nato is capable of bringing 20 + million ground troops there needed to take down moscow . 
  most people who think russia can easily be defeated have no idea what they are talking about . 
  you know its a legit proxy war when russian language becomes mandatory in syrian schools ( true story ), 
  and best of all , medical marijuana . 
  all we need now is some random serbian guy to trigger everything and the prophecy is complete, 
  [ greeks paid a land tax and a heavy tax on trade , the latter taking advantage of the wealthy greeks to fill the state coffers . \\ [ 27 \\ ] greeks , like other christians , were also made to pay the jizya , or islamic poll-tax which all non-muslims in the empire were forced to pay instead of the zakat that muslims must pay as part of the 5 pillars of islam . 
  failure to pay the jizya could result in the pledge of protection of the christian 's life and property becoming void , facing the alternatives of conversion ; enslavement or death ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ottoman_greece )  these practices are called the `` tribute of children '' ( devshirmeh ) ( in greek \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03b6\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1 paidomazoma , meaning `` child gathering '' ) , whereby every christian community was required to give one son in five to be raised as a muslim and enrolled in the corps of janissaries , elite units of the ottoman army . 
  there was much resistance , for example , greek folklore tells of mothers crippling their sons to avoid their abduction . 
  all greeks had to pay jizya , no exceptions and not only for military aged males . 
  janissary 's was a form of `` human tax '' alongside the jizya tax and both were used to keep the peace and absolutely unavoidable . 
  greeks lived as 2nd class citizens in an apartheid system under islamic law . 
  the main reason is because greeks formed isolated communities mostly on islands/rough terrain and payed a substanial amount of their wealth to the `` jizya tax '' ( religious tax ) so they were left alone . 
  `` co-existing '' is possible under islam rule but not a pleasant experience my point is not that muslims are incapable of co-existing with the kuffar . 
  . only that when they reach majority population the laws must be suited to fit with islamic belief system . 
  there are already large areas of uk which live under islamic law since they are the majority of small territories, 
  nice one , idiot . 
  if you want to be lab rats living over a bubble of toxic waste , i could not care less . 
  hope you got payed well for this post i would still fight to the death to prevent my local lands being turned into a corporate science experiment . 
  uk people have no fight left in them anyway , the perfect model of the `` post-european '' society . 
  have fun . 
  it is not a theory if it has been done numerous times before in history, 
  history books, 
  well if you want to exist in basically what amounts to a science experiment , i consider you brave . 
  i would fight to the death to prevent such a thing on my lands but everyone is different . 
  chelsea football club - 2-3 billion ? 
  stage 1 - religion of peace phase ( 1-10 % of population ) - just minding their own business while popping 5-10 kids each stage 2 - defense of islam phase ( 10-30 % of population ) - start to get political , demand sharia courts/food-stuffs/etc , special privileges , protesting , riots , lone wolf acts of violence , mass radicalization stage 3 - war for islamic takeover of the kuffar ( 30-50 + % of population ) around near majority , they refuse to co-exist and demand their own state/country based on islamic values , terrorism and outbreak of war reaches crticial mass. 
  to put it simply would you like to live within a few kilometers of a fracking unit knowing that they are pumping trillions of tons of toxic chemicals under your feet ? 
  honest question, 
  damn `` british '', 
  yes there is , if you live near the fracking location the poisons seep into the water supply to create a toxic water that can ignite . 
  here is an example - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lbjsxwqrv8 fracking does not do damage above ground , fracking pumps trillions of gallons of toxic chemicals deep underground . 
  for the local community there is not only no short-term gain but long-term it could make their local land into a toxic wasteland . 
  never had that before all you need is a fresh lemon + knife - cut in half and squeeze every other topping destroy 's the natural flavor of the kalamari, 
  italy for me too, 
  my personal favorite is fried kalamari with plenty of fresh lemon juice squeezed on top , preferably at a restaurant next to the beach on an island . 
  i dont speak russian , i just copy/paste from the official ukraine civil war subreddit . 
  also i have not picked sides at all , i support an independent ukraine but also a situation that supports the rights of the east ukraine ethnic russians . 
  i am somewhere in between , but i will never go against my ukraine bro 's who just want to live in peace . 
  put them in jail and throw the key away, 
  bunch of freaks on that show , they talk like robotic actors . 
  fucking lizards, 
  you ca n't even agree that uk is an american puppet nowadays ? 
  our maybe not wanting another us puppet to fuck with eu politics ? 
  uk is already one puppet to many, 
  whatever you say youssef, 
  exactly , germans took advantage of a weak socialist government . 
  i can not blame them at all for doing this , the only thing that angers me is that to avoid being seen in a bad light for manipulating socialist they spread propaganda that this entire crisis was the average greek citizens fault . 
  and then they get surprised when people get furious about this ? 
  here is the main reason for the crisis , and it will never be known to the average german living in his/her propaganda bubble .

  greece is shaping up to be a natural gas hub by 2020 , capable of supplying 40-60 % of all eu 's natural gas needs for a century with the 3 pipelines being built + trillions in gas in aegean/ionian sea 's . 
  we just need to stabalize the situation until then , 6 years seems like a long time but it will come relatively fast compared to other alternatives . 
  nice one idiot i support samaras government , which is why most greek posters on this subreddit dislike me . 
  and what money is that ? 
  greece has never received any money , all `` bailout '' money has never left germany as the entire point of the `` bailout '' is to give to german banks who over-loaned to greek socialist government pre-2008, 
  you anti-semite !, 
  cool story, 
  he will use these troops if dutch/australia / forces enter mh17 crash site , full out assault . 
  putin believes that the dutch forces entering mh17 crash site is a way for nato to get a foothold in east ukraine and destroy the rebels , thus he is sending a message of threat to nato by doing this . 
  russian forces also staged a mock invasion this morning on the ukraine/russian border , 30 + apc 's / tanks rushed to the border point with russian flags high on the vehicles and then did an abrupt turn . 
  this a very threatening gesture http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymykpifcmhm, 
  one of biggest problems for ukraine right now are double agents working in ato/military operations . 
  i read a translation from a ukraine fighter yesterday that was trapped in east ukraine , and he said that he did not give details of where their location was to ato command because he said they were all double agents working for russia and that he has known multiple cases of ambushes being set up after giving details of location to ato . 
  they managed to escape without any help from ato command .
