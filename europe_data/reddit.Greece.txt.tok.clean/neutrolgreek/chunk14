  it would be pretty idiotic to say that russian nationals are not involved in the fighting in east ukraine . 
  but it would also be similarly idiotic to say that none of the rebels are of the 10 million ethnic russians living/lived in east ukraine . 
  it seems the current situation is very fluid with battalions of ethnic russians from both sides of the border fighting alongside each other with main supply routes of weaponry being from crimea and donetsk/russian border, 
  rebels are hiding their true numbers imo , but that is just my theory . 
  i have heard of rumors of massive battalions of rebels who are armed to the teeth that have not entered the battle yet , they are likely waiting for a `` stalingrad '' situation to truly grind down the ukrainian army . 
  it seems that the main objective of the rebels currently is to prolong this conflict to winter where they can get the upper hand . 
  strelkov , one of the rebel leaders has already posted a statement that they are accepting donations for `` winter clothing '' at the moment since they do not want to rush to get the clothing in september . 
  this war is going to go get uglier , imo . 
  just a few hours ago this was uploaded to youtube . 
  a ukrainian army battalion absolutely massacred by a grad rocket assault ( notice the top half of tanks blown off . 
  absolutely insane footage ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9icq0k0pey# !,

  i will never understand how they go at speeds of 100/120 while in ice-road conditions, 
  do you honestly think putin is stupid or something ? 
  he understands that any dutch mission into mh17 crash site will bring in thousands of nato troops by winter . 
  i 've said this before , but any dutch mission to the crash site would be met with the full force of the russian federation military and could trigger a bigger event . 
  i ca n't even imagine the shitstorm if france goes along with selling that invasion ship to russia, 
  i see , well i guess she expected greece to let is slide as she tried to enter the country last week and was denied which caused a `` crisis '' apparently . 
  greece has already used sanctions against russia by barring putin 's most powerful adviser from entering the country, 
  good news  thanks for link, 
  it wouldnt be the same . 
  it would only work in olympia greece, 
  `` avenge me '' were his final words rip putin, 
  the modern olympics does n't even have any of the same games as the ancient olympics , so i do n't even want that one . 
  i want a real european olympics with only ancient style games pankration ( ancient mma ) no rounds , no points , no rules besides no eyes/genitals attacks marathon race + various other races main event = track race with each person wearing 30-50 kilos of traditional military uniform, 
  and drunk, 
  pagan rituals also welcome  the entire point of ancient greek olympics was as a religious festival to get favor with the gods , so half the event was a religious festival including theater/music/dancing etc while the other half was the actual sporting events . 
  it would be pretty awesome to bring back some pagan rituals back to modern world for fun, 
  olympics did n't ruin the country , that is just propaganda fed to you . 
  30 years of massive military spending caused the crisis , not a 10 billion $ olympics which is pennies compared to military spending . 
  also , the entire point of having it in one spot forever is that you invest the money , say 10-20 billion and then every 4 years you keep using the same facilities so it will pay itself off easily after 2-3 games . 
  the olympics should have always been held in olympia , greece from the beginning to today . 
  i would at least like a european only `` mini-olympics '' to be held in olympia every 4 years . 
  maybe just invite eu countries only and have old style events like bare-knuckle fighting and track races with traditional military uniform like in ancient greek games . 
  russia just signed a 300 billion $ deal with china recently so it looks like they are looking to eastern markets primarily china/india for the future . 
  tap is biggest pipeline , that one alone will supply 20-25 % of eu 's gas . 
  the emp is half the size of the tap and the igb is half the size of the emp . 
  tap/emp will mostly be used to supply eu countries while igb will be used primarily for the balkans region , both eu and not eu . 
  not sure about adriatic sea but it is very likely there is some gas there since italian/greek project has already begun on three gas blocks just south of it in the ionian sea, 
  there are three major pipelines going through greece , currently being built that will supply the eu with around 40-60 % of all natural gas needs for at least a century . 
  they will be fully operational between 2020-2022 largest pipeline - [ tap ] ( http://www.tap-ag.com/ ) second - [ emp ] ( http://www.cyprusgasnews.com/id/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/the-east-med-pipeline2.jpg ) third - [ igb ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gas_interconnector_greece-bulgaria ) a few dozen blocks in aegean sea went for sale last week for exploration with greek/italian joint drilling operation already starting in ionian sea, 
  [ ** `` a kind of anti-society has grown up in them -- a population that derives the meaning of its life from the hatred it bears for the other , `` official , '' society in france . 
  this alienation , this gulf of mistrust is greater than any i have encountered anywhere else in the world , including in the black townships of south africa during the apartheid years -- is written on the faces of the young men , most of them permanently unemployed , who hang out in the pocked and potholed open spaces between their logements .

  i think i saw one actual german riding his bike, 
  [ 1 ] ( http://usa.greekreporter.com/2014/07/14/greek-satellite-in-space-video/ ) - greece launches space program with satellite set to arrive to the international space station ( iss ) on july 16 , and will conduct first graphene test in space [ 2 ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/07/19/putin-right-hand-not-allowed-in-greece/ ) - `` serious diplomatic crisis between athens and moscow '' as greek foreign ministry have barred valentina ivanovna matviyenko , `` putin 's right hand '' , from coming to greece [ 3 ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/15/travel/greek-island-hopping/ ) - new seaplane service to open up greek islands for `` express island hopping '', 
  as far as the natural gas in the leviathian basin , it will be split between greek cyprus and israel . 
  there is also a pipeline being built , you can [ see here ] ( http://www.cyprusgasnews.com/id/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/the-east-med-pipeline2.jpg ) the exact size and location of the pipeline which will connect israel/cyprus to greece . 
  this pipeline is estimated to provide around 15-20 % of all eu 's natural gas needs for close to a century, 
  i ca n't say your wrong but as far as equipment goes , greece in the future is heading towards building its own arsenal also . 
  for example , with the leopard 2 a6/a4 deal with germany ( largest in history ) . 
  we also signed a deal to get the full engineering rights to build our own leopard 2 a6 . 
  ( best tank ever made ) greece now builds its own main battle tank the leopard 2 hel , a modified leo 2 a6 built for greek terrain . 
  greece also builds its own sniper rifles , mortars , artillery , explosives and other smaller things that are critical to a major war . 
  for the future greece and germany have partnered to build a next-generation fighter drone by 2020 , which will be the future of greece 's air superiority in the region . 
  greece has also had a drone program since 1978 and has sucessfully released two surveillance drone models , one in 80 's and one in 2003 . 
  these drones are the backbone of aegean surveillance and can fly up to 24 hours straight before landing . 
  greek space program was launched last week with satellite which landed at the iss , which means greece is also entering the space military field for things like tracking the enemy from satellite and spying , an essential component to the future drone program . 
  also all soldiers lack experience before a major war , do you think the greeks who were fighting 200,000 vs 800,000 italians in ww2 knew how to fight ? 
  most of them were using late 1800 's rifles . 
  in a real war , a greek is a mad dog when it comes to protecting the homeland especially . 
  google the greeks who fought in korean war to see what americans thought about them . 
  `` best soldiers on earth '' is a phrase you will hear . 
  it is possible it was only 12-15 ,000 recently , but after the plane tragedy and recent rumors of nato invasion of east ukraine , it must be closer to 50,000 . 
  russia has been moving a nearly endless amount of heavy armour and equipment by railroad to the border the last 4 + months non-stop . 
  12,000 is simply not enough of people to handle the amount of equipment being delivered . 
  this entire `` multicultural '' experiment is a trojan horse, 
  12 thousand are within 5-10 kilometers of russian/ukraine border , another 30-40 thousand are within 50-100 kilometers, 
  cheney is the mastermind behind the last 25 + years of american foreign intervention . 
  he literally wrote the damn blueprint for everything usa has done called the [ wolfowitz doctrine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wolfowitz_doctrine ) what is happening and happened in ukraine has alot to do with the wolfowitz doctrine, 
  stupid drunk who launched that missile will burn in hell, 
  the issue is not that the crash site should be protected , the problem is , it is worth potentially creating the spark that ignites ww3 ? 
  i have no doubts that if american troops land in east ukraine , putin will order the 50,000 + troops and tens of billions $ worth of military hardware sitting on the russian/ukraine border to confront them . 
  i agree , but i think a dutch/american invasion of rebel territory will ignite a world war . 
  if nato sends americans to go kill russians in east ukraine , russia will send the entire force of their military to confront them head on . 
  what happens if nato loses their initial mission ? 
  world war, 
  perfect timing, 
  my best guess is that the upcoming gas drilling in the aegean/ionian sea 's will have a significant percentage used for paying the debt down over a 20-30 year period . 
  estimated to be up to 10 + trillion of gas in greek waters with italy/greece partnership already starting drilling last month in greek waters and 9 blocks for exploration around crete selling last week + norway still in process of exploring central greek waters . 
  greece already signed a law to make 10 % of all profits go into science research and 90 % into norwegian style `` gas fund '' , but i expect some of it to pay the debt down also . 
  i would be far far more worried about france defaulting the way it is going . 
  . france is going to end up looking like the balkans in 1878 by 2030 the way it is heading . 
  that 's one way to create a world war i am sure cheney and his ilk are rubbing their hands together in their underground bunkers, 
  why get so defensive over a joke ? 
   also , the `` bailout '' scheme has already been incredibly profitable and will be for the next century dw.de - [ german bank bailout fund posts first ever full-year profit ] ( http://www.dw.de/german-bank-bailout-fund-posts-first-ever-full-year-profit/a-16809503 ) greece has also posted major primary surplus two years running with foreign investment and domestic investment skyrocketing . 
  no need to sell invasion ships to dictators , 
  that would be funny  100,000 active + few thousand special forces types with millions ready if necessary . 
  like i said though , our entire countries viewpoint on military use is for purely defensive purposes for greece/europe . 
  we can help with us/uk/france invasions of foreign land like we did for us/uk in iraq and afghanistan . 
  greece decided to take 500 m1a1 abram tanks for free instead of a payment for the assistance . 
  this is already on top of our 1,000 leopard 2 a6/a4 currently active . 
  still no delivery of m1a1 but likely by end of the decade, 
  russia follows greek orthodox religion , not sure if they call it greek orthodox or just orthodox but greek pilgrims converted their people around 10th century ad religious tourism is becoming fairly popular with ukrainians/russians , hopefully ukraine joins eu soon so they can easily travel to greece . 
  greece also is equal in terms of overall military strength with france/uk largest modern tank force in europe and a modern air-force with top 5 ranked pilots , millions of paratroopers/special forces/etc . 
  but no aircraft carrier , greek islands are set up for that role . 
  greece has 3-4 of [ these beasts ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_3wzswfvzzqm/tc6bks09cui/aaaaaaaahnm/unldctf-djw/s1600/l181.jpg ) for rapid invasion of land with tanks/troops but they are only really useful in greek islands region the entire mindset of greek military is for pure defensive purposes so we are not much useful for foreign wars,
