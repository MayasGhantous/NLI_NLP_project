  no , uk could not act what happens when a uk jet gets shot down by russian anti-air ? 
  would you really risk the potential of world war 3 right now ? 
  also , if uk/us/nato goes in then it would drive tens of thousands of ethnic russians living in ukraine and russia to sign up to fight them within hours . 
  you would have to enter with a full-scale invasion force, 
  so does greece though, 
  sorry , it was 10 % drop with 15 billion in losses http://www.ukrstat.gov.ua/operativ/operativ2014/fin/chpr/chpr_ed/chpr_ed_r/chpr_ed_0114_r.htm, 
  http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=0ae_1405699122 you are correct , the civilians were killed by shelling as you can see by the damage in surrounding area . 
  i do n't think war is ending any time soon . 
  videos being uploaded now show the civilians were kiled by ukrainian military shelling , ukrainian army is currently storming luhansk and shelling the city http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=0ae_1405699122, 
  ukraine already posted nearly a 15 % drop in gdp for first quarter of 2014 , so this is likely another 15-20 % ? 
  i see , so its different than regular ted conferences ? 
  it should be interesting either way, 
  iraq is going to shit too . 
  greece got ur back polan , if shit goes down, 
  it would be a disgrace for france to go with the sell of those ships . 
  they are a purely invasion ship , meant to rapidly invade foreign land , not for defensive purposes . 
  rip :( i really hope they went unconscious nearly instantly , which is likely the case, 
  they are a mix of thracian ( the ancient people of those lands and enemies of ancient greeks ) , slavs and some greek . 
  there hasnt been such a thing as `` macedonian '' blood since 148 bc you dumb motherfucker in 148 bc when makedon fell to rome and all of free greece with it , this destroyed the city-state rule of greece . 
  over the next 300 years during rome rule , besides the first years which was the roman civil war . 
  was mostly a peaceful time where all the greek city-states actually learned about each other and accepted each other greek race ( there was 4 greek races - doria/ionian/aechean / aeolian ) after rome fell the greek races merged to create the modern greek person and they created the greatest empire known to man , byzantine . 
  pure aechean blood which was the race the macedonians were part of stopped existed nearly 2,000 years ago . 
  the same with pure dorian blood ( spartans ) and pure ionian blood ( athenian ) . 
  they all merged to create the modern greek . 
  1,000 years after the merger . 
  the slavic push came from up north and the people of modern day fyrom came along with it . 
  these people overran and conquered the thracian race , the ancient enemies of greek people and assimilated with them to create the modern fyrom person . 
  modern fyrom is slavic/thracian blood . 
  if you want to say some people from fyrom has greek blood . 
  i am 100 % fine with that . 
  but to say they have blood of a 2,000 year extinct race of greek aecheans ( macedonians ) is insanity . 
  i do n't give a shit if they want to call themselves macedonian as long as they celebrate greek culture and cherish what my greek ancestors did . 
  but to say that alexander was 100 % slavic ( which is what they do ) . 
  that is not going to go well with me or any other greek . 
  that was not their king i could say george washington was the president of greece , and teach that in greek schools . 
  but it still would not make it true . 
  alexander the great was a greek king of makedon and whose descendants united greece to fight against rome for 300 years until greece 's fall in 148 bc to rome, 
  you seriously do n't know ? 
  what the fuck is up with spain and taking pleasure in torturing animals to death ? 
  alexandroski the greatski * please show respect to the great slavic warlord, 
  either way , we are the `` bad guys '' for not accepting their sick beliefs . 
  in this politically correct insane asylum that is modern western world , you need to accept anything everyone wants to be seen as . 
  sorry for not giving two shits when `` macedonians '' are doing the same thing to greece , claiming they are descendants of a 2,400 year old greek king who created the [ hellenistic period ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hellenistic_period ) basically albania is pulling the same thing on them , claiming skopje as their `` historic lands '' . 
  that entire place is like the fucking twilight zone . 
  tourism is growing fairly rapidly , 4 years ago greece received 15 million tourists and now 22 million are expected this year which is a great growth . 
  there is a very high rate of return vacationers who come every year and also tell their friends about their great experience . 
  i think by 2020 , 28-30 million tourists a year could be possible when the athens `` mega-park '' is complete . 
  they are also building a new f1 racetrack near athens harbor , where ultra-wealthy people can park their yachts right up to the race track . 
  hopefully porto  athens happens soon , i am suprised its not already, 
  video of launch - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka3rhusbf20, 
  cold war 2.0 is in full swing im assuming at this point, 
  you know very little of syria to think that the protest killings is what caused the civil war , it was merely the match that lit the 30 year long fuse . 
  you also know very little to think the fsa was a major player , this is the reason the fsa is largely disbanded , the sucessor of the fsa , the srf ( syrian revolution front ) works alongside nusra in a number of fronts in this war . 
  the major armed groups in this war are isis , nusra and islamic front ( dozens of jihadist groups under saudi control ) . 
  srf is mainly used as a token force to funnel weapons and money to these jihadist groups . 
  for example many of the advanced anti-tank weapons recently given such as the tow have been found in nusra/if hands recently . 
  the syrians were given two options . 
  assad or the jihadists . 
  there never was hope for the `` moderate '' rebels and never will be . 
  the syrians have chosen assad , not because they all love him . 
  in fact many who support him politically , absolutely despise him as a person . 
  but they support him and die for his army because they do not want to see a bunch of barbarians ruling over them . 
  syrian woman do not want to wear blankets to get groceries and the men want to live in a secular society where alawites , sunnis , shias , zoroastrians , christians and even jews can live together . 
  bad idea to arm and train jihadist in syria this is what happens when you think a short-term hi-risk scenario will play out instead of the high probability reality that unfolded, 
  only thing i have to add [ 10 billion dollar project set to transform old athens airport into global destination and being developed by the richest greek on earth - will create 60,000 jobs ] ( http://www.pappaspost.com/multi-billion-dollar-project-set-transform-old-athens-airport-global-destination/ )  plans for the 65 million square foot land include one of the biggest parks in the world , top sports facilities , one of the largest aquariums in the world that will celebrate and preserve greek oceanic life , an upgraded coastal front and a residential tower called `` one of the tallest in the mediterranean '' by organizers . 
  i ca n't believe its finally happening . 
  it seems like this whole quest to sell this real estate and develop it has been a decade long story [ canadian credit rating agency dbrs upgraded greece 's long-term credit rating to `` b '' from `` ccc '' ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/07/12/canadian-dbrs-upgrades-greeces-credit-rating-to-b/ ), 
  90 % of people who vote for golden dawn are not nazi 's but very anti-immigrant . 
  so in your view , those who are anti-illegal immigrant are not `` normal people '' correct ? 
  greek people are known through-out the world for their hospitality . 
  this does n't mean they can accept a never-ending stream of unwanted illegal immigrants . 
  most of these illegals end up in detention camps and only allowed to leave when they accept to fly back home , they need to understand they risking their lives for nothing . 
  it is not a dogfighter , that is what the f16 is in the 1st stages of a major power war you will need to win a dogfighting air battle first and the f35 is not capable of that . 
  f35 was built to be a missile launcher and drone cloud operator in the sky , not to fight gritty dogfights . 
  the f35 's stealth only lasts until the second it lowers its missile bay and/or fires off a missile . 
  once that missile is loose , it is like a blinking red light on radar and will get a few f16 's on its tail and its history . 
  once air superirity is gained than the f35 truly shines in its role as a `` jack of all trades '' . 
  by 2025-2030 when the `` drone cloud '' system is perfected in the f35 then i will possibly consider it as the superior dogfighter as it can take on f16 with the assistance of smart-drones controlled by the f35 's computer system . 
  this is what will make the f35 truly shine . 
  . and why it is being constantly delayed for eternity . 
  the main goal of the f35 is to be a missile arsenal in the sky while controlling up to a dozen next-generation `` smart-drones '' through its computer system .

  chinese decided on greece due to its proximity to the suez canal since the piraeus deal was made in 2013 , cosco invested around 300 million euros in uprading the port and has already trippled the containers shipped in less than a year . 
  according to chinese reports it has cut the time of delivery of chinese exports into europe by 11 days which is a pretty big deal . 
  the visit last week by chinese pm was to do the same upgrades in thessaloniki port in northern greece and to also sign multi-billion contracts for greek exports to china , mainly in organic food sector but also things like marble and minerals . 
  there was also a deal signed to build a greek `` china-town '' adjacent to the athens airport , meant to boost chinese tourism to greece and to create a nice residential area for chinese immigrants . 
  heretic !, 
  zeus will not take kindly to this claim !, 
  fuck the f35 , that is a pure air superiority jet to get air superiority in the 1st place you need some modern ugpraded f16 's , you can buy almost 5-6 modern f16 's for the price of one f35 in the future when the `` drone cloud '' network on the f35 is running well than yeh it will be the dominant force in the skies , but not before that imo, 
  thank you my german friend, 
  try not to generalize by saying things like `` the greeks '' when referring to a person/persons opinion . 
  i personally think the biggest issue greek small business owners had was the freezing of small business loans after the credit crunch of 2008 . 
  it is only opening up in 2014 with new government projects to boost start-ups with easy access to small business loans . 
  that is just my personal opinion that tsipras represents pasok 2.0 if he somehow wins the next election , greece is fucked . 
  i think that is everybody 's reaction right now,
