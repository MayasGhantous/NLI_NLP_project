  some major economic events in the last 60 days which might have influenced this decision [ multi-billion dollar project set to transform old athens airport into global destination and being developed by the richest greek on earth ] ( http://www.pappaspost.com/multi-billion-dollar-project-set-transform-old-athens-airport-global-destination/ ) [ `` chinese prime minister visits greece june 20 , sees greek shipping harbor piraeus as `` gateway into eu '' for chinese goods . . will make piraeus/thessaloniki harbors `` the most competitive port in the world .

  i agree , tsipras is for the complete idiots who voted for pasok in the 80 's / 90 's . 
  i respect samaras because he is aggressively targeting foreign and domestic investment . 
  2 weeks ago china and greece signed a 10 billion a year contract to transform two shipping harbors in greece to cosco european headquarters and also greek exports to china contracts this week samaras got the richest greek on earth to sign a 5 billion $ deal to transform old athens airport to a worldwide holiday destination . 
  this year he also signed 3 natural gas pipeline deals and tons of more things . 
  tsipras is a communist who wants to destroy greece , a sleeper agent of the elite . 
  . samaras actually fights for greece, 
  greece just signed a potential 10 billion a year chinese-greek shipping deal 2 weeks ago when prime minister of china visisted . 
  two shipping ports in greece will be the `` gateway '' of chinese goods into europe and the most competetive ports in the world accoring to chinese pm . 
  greece is in process of building 3 major natural gas pipleins that will supply the eu with 40-50 % of natural gas for the next century . 
  and this week the greek government got the richest greek on earth , latsis , to sign a 5 billion euro contract to turn the old athens airport into a worldwide holiday destination the next 5-6 years will be very lean years but by 2020-2022 there will be a major economic push with these new economic assests so there is something `` going for it '', 
  `` he held the gate '' :(, 
  putin fears maidan of ukraine more than anything else he fears this beacuse he sees the possibility of a `` russian maidan '' happening in moscow , thus what he is accomplishing is forcing the russians to view ukraine and especially the maidan movement as the `` enemy '' . 
  one to be destroyed and read in future russian history books as the ultimate evil when you try to usurp the establishment government . 
  like tacitus said , it is about sending a message not only to neighbouring countries to not leave russian sphere but also to russian citizens . 
  [ u mad ? 
  ] ( https://warosu.org/data/vr/img/0015/16/1396888117306.jpg ), 
   plans for the 65 million square foot land include one of the biggest parks in the world , top sports facilities , one of the largest aquariums in the world that will celebrate and preserve greek oceanic life , an upgraded coastal front and a residential tower called `` one of the tallest in the mediterranean '' by organizers . 
  very exciting to see this , 
  hows the weather in nigeria ? 
  when it comes down to it . 
  . the current system of `` never-ending growth or death '' capitalism is bound to collapse . 
  it is impossible to always grow as resources are becoming more and more limited . 
  something has to eventually give , and it looks like the stage is being set for the `` big one '' . 
  it is not a coincidence that every western government is passing all these laws and measures to militarize the police and control internet with `` terrorism '' laws . 
  its going to get very very ugly soon . 
  the craziest thing is how he is obviously grooming his son ( who look like joffrey baratheon ) for leadership . 
  so does the collapse happen first and then the banking union ? 
  or does the banking union happen then the collapse ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glass%e2%80%93steagall_legislation banks stopped being banks and ended up becoming huge corporate casino 's, 
  1984 was n't a manual uk government , it was just a damn book !, 
  so golden dawn is also a `` far-right '' political background . 
  not nazi 's right ? 
  i do n't give a shit if ukraine uses those with `` far-right political background '' ( who happen to use nazi symbols , ideology of supremacy and nazi salute ) . 
  but this will cause unforseen consequences in the future . 
  let 's say that things somehow do calm down and people return home , and then watch on russian tv 24 / / 7 how nazi 's literally came to their village and killed people . 
  this will cause a 2nd uprising . 
  then a 3rd , then a 4th . 
  etc you fell into putin 's trap by using those with `` far-right political background '', 
  from the videos ive seen of the actual battles being filmed by the dutch forces themselves . 
  they looked absolutely out of their depth . 
  i can not blame them personally , there was literally a hell of mortars and gunfire around them and they were not trained well enough to deal with it and not enough manpower/equipment . 
  i could be wrong but that is the sense i got from the videos ive seen as they were filming the surrounding battles . 
  ofcourse not . 
  these are the same people who sent entire battalions of neo nazi 's to go kill russians in the east . 
  [ neo-nazi azov battalion take oath in kiev under wolfsangel flag ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgxvo6gf_fs ) [ neo-nazi azov battalion fighting in mariupol around 2 weeks ago ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9jitrxfoce ) [ neo-nazi right sector battalion fighting in front-lines of donbass this week ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kncihoqqjik ) i understand ukraine needs to fight the rebels . 
  . but when you send hardcore nazi 's to do your fighting , something is very fucking wrong poroshenko is proud of these men as you can see here [ poroshenko in radas is saying how glorious ua army is crushing the seps . 
  some woman shouts `` our army is killing children ! '', 
  for which he replies `` no one criticizes our army ! '', 
  smacks the desk and gets a standing ovation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkqe9igopy ) edit : nice downvotes for showing the truth . 
  keep on downvoting idiots, 
  i agree that tourism is not something to be really `` proud '' about as far industry , but tourism has massive benefits as it provides a stable income for millions of greeks who have small businesses . 
  the greek tourism minister has made an official goal to increase tourism 10 % every year and she has hit that goal 4 years in a row since making that statement ( which was ridiculed at the time ) greece has potential to bring in around 30-35 million tourists by 2030 and that is the goal , if greece hits that it will be amazing for the economy . 
  tourism not only raises the greek economy , but shows that greece is a safe and stable country . 
  which foreign investors crave for . 
  the increased tourism and stability the last few years is why the emir of qatar decided to buy 10 uninhabited islands near ithaca island to build massive luxury palaces to rent out to `` ultra-wealthy '' celebrities/elite from around the world . 
  ithaca island is getting a part of the island turned into a `` mini-monaco '' . 
  . all this has happened in 2014 with increased confidence in greece . 
  greek tourism minister is also heavily targeting the `` ultra-wealthy '' tourism sector in multiple levels . 
  bt like you said , tourism is not something you can always depend on . . which is why these shipping/energy deals are so critical and will make greece economy something to respect by 2020-2025 . 
  greek government is actualy being smart , which is why i support samaras . 
  in early 2014 he passed into a law that made 10 % of all future gas profits , potentially trillions go into a science research fund and 90 % of profits go intoa `` norway style gas fund '' and he hired the same norway team that made theirs . 
  greek government is actually acting like a real government for once in modern greek history . 
  . instead of a byzantine corrupt beraucracy, 
  `` greece prefers civil war '' . 
  where the fuck is the civil war ? 
  greece has gone through a great depression nearly 30 % worse than the great depression in usa during the 1920 's . 
  and the worst thing to happen was a riots in athens square between hardcore political extremists in 2010 eu studies have shown that greeks work the longest hours in the eu for the least amount of benefits , the least amount of social security , the least amount of medical aid and care , the least vacation , least job security and least protection in europe . 
  and then we have romanian idiots like yourself talking shit . 
  greece has taken this entire crisis with the absolute most amount of grace you possibly could . . no other country on earth would have been so peaceful as greece has the last few years , none . 
  watch what happens in a few decades when the northern economies start to crumble and they will my friend . 
  there will be wars and massacres . 
  greece has posted a primary surplus in 2013 and the first 5 months of 2014 greece has posted a primary surplus four times the amount set by the troika . 
  greece is set to start growing again in 2014/2015 and will be exponentially growing from here on as we are hitting record numbers of tourists every year with 22 million expected this year ( 2x greek population ) . 
  .3 pipelines in development with one the igb pipeline set to make greece a exporter to romania/bulgaria . 
  . the other two the tap and emp will make greece the energy hub of the eu by 2020 when the pipelines are complete . 
  greece signed massive shipping deals with chinese cosco shipping company , transofrming piraeus and thessalniki harbors into the `` gateway of china into europe '' . 
  multi-billion euro deals were signed last week with china for greek exports to china . 
  we have taken this crisis . 
  . struggled like nobody else . 
  kept our pride and no wars happened . 
  and finally going to transform our economy into a 21st century one . 
  you should be worried about romania . 
  your country has made absolutely no progress in any sector the last decade and still has a 20th century economy . 
  hopefully you will learn from greece when you see how it has changed massively . 
  it will take a few years to truly see the radical changes but you will understand fairly soon . 
  darwinism at its finest, 
  why do you think victoria `` pitbull face '' nuland and john `` senile '' mccain visited kiev to rile up the crowd for revolution , when national elections were only a few months away ? 
  then right after that the vice president appointed his son to run ukraine 's national gas/oil company . 
  i feel really bad for ukrainian people right now, 
  if germany does not win it this year . 
  . they never will, 
  their defense is completely lost without thiago silva david luiz is a great defender but he is not smart enough to lead the defense , silva is the key to the brazil team as much as neymar is for the attack, 
  saddest part is that they died for nothing their children and families lost a father just to protect us corporate profits, 
  do n't believe anything coming from that lizard, 
  still needs to catch up to victoria `` fuck the eu '' nuland, 
  last real president was jfk , his murder was a coup by the cia . 
  the leader of cia at that time was george bush senior ... 
  there was also a deathbed confession by a famous cia agent 2 years ago , same agent who stood in trial for watergate conspiracy,
