   ** `` mario draghi warned that the pace of economic fixes is slowing '' ** this comes after two years of major primary surplus , with the first half of 2014 having a surplus 4x the one set by the troika . 
  the fixes are n't slowing . 
  the privitization is slowing and has not gone according to the troika 's plan to say the least . 
  i am assuming they thought greece would sell half the country which was the plan for the troika but all they got so far was a crappy lottery company and a mismanaged obsolete bank . 
  the 3rd bailout by troika would come with requirement to sell everything they wanted but have n't gotten so far . 
  and it will never happen . 
  greece is in the process of building 3 major pipelines and becoming a gas exporter to bulgaria/romania by early 2015 and total eu exporter by 2020 when tap and emp pipelines are complete . 
  instead of privitizing , greece has instead targeted foreign investment in tourism and shipping sector and greece is expected to finally start growing its economy in 2014/2015 . 
  troika are obviously very angry for not stripping greece of its wealth . 
  . they have ukraine at least , which is a much easier target . 
  . so i am sure they will still get some sleep tonight /, 
  why do you think preserving a country 's culture is a `` racist remark '' you also added a loaded word with `` purity '' . 
  subliminally making it seem that people who want t keep their culture and traditions are nazi 's . 
  europeans will be 5 % of the entire world population by 2100 , and less than half of those 5 % will actually be native europeans . 
  am i crazy to think that there is a possibility of our cultures being erased if this mass immigration is not stopped ? 
  when is enough , truly enough with you people ? 
  when non-swedes are the majority in sweden in 2050 ? 
  and no this is not fear-mongering , 2040 is also a possible year that non-swedes will be the majority . 
  question : do you / r/cyridius want immigration to the point of making the native population a minority ? 
  because that is what is happening . 
  if i am against this , does that make me a nazi ? 
  his job is to tag users though, 
  pee standing up is a barbaric male privilege you beast !, 
  anyone who opposes mass immigration is not a racist , evil nazi that does not mean there are n't many who are racist assholes . 
  but that is a minority imo . 
  i truly believe the majority of normal everyday citizens in europe are against non-european immigration . 
  does that make me a racist evil bastard ? 
  ** `` danish '' ** danes are not swedes . 
  they wo n't stand for this shit, 
  good pilot awareness, 
  fyi , i did n't create this graph !, 
  greeks always have the last laugh, 
  the shrapnel alone from that round could take out an entire city block, 
  greeks are extremely pro-eu . 
  even during the worst of the last few years . 
  we are with this thing until the end , it is what the people want . 
  greece would go to civil war to prevent gmo/monsanto yes , that is how serious food is taken, 
  i can not predict the future . 
  i have only quoted what the chinese prime minister said in his recent visit last week to athens to sign these deals . 
  did i say myself that athens/thessaloniki will replace rotterdam ? 
  no , i did not and i do not know if greece is capable of beating rotterdam . 
  . but athens/thessaloniki can definitely go and sit alongside rotterdam as the combined shipping hubs of the eu . 
  china is going to use athens/thessaloniki as their `` drop-off '' point which is why they brought 66 % stake in piraeus and thessaloniki harbor and have already invested nearly 500 million $ with around 500 million more investment planned to modernize them . 
  chinese shipping giant cosco and greek shipping companies made a deal to work together during the chinese pm visit . 
  so i am assuming when china drops off the goods in greece , the smaller greek vessels will then depart to other regions such as rotterdam , uk , africa and possibly south america . 
  what is known is that the chinese prime minister himself said that the harbors will be `` the most competetive in the world '' and the `` gateway of chinese goods and investment in the eu '' take those quotes as you like , but i do not know the chinese to joke around you seem to take great offense that i was saying that greece will overtake rotterdam . 
  do not worry about that . 
  . it is more like greece will become shipping partners with rotterdam , i meant no offense . 
  and the energy hub is absolute fact in regards to natural gas , i should have clarified but yes only natural gas . 
  . not coal or oil . 
  the tap pipeline ( azerbaijan  greece ) is due to be fully operational in 2020-2022 and will span across the entire northern greek region . 
  it is one of the biggest construction projects in modern greek history and this pipeline alone will provide around 20-25 % of natural gas for the eu for the next 100 years . 
  the emp pipeline , half the size of tap is currently being built between israel/cyprus  greece and will connect the leviathian gas basin to greece . 
  it is due to be complete in 2020-2022 and wll provide around 15 % of eu 's natural gas needs for the next century . 
  the smallest pipeline , half the size of the emp will be the igb and this pipeline is from greece  bulgaria/romania and due to be complete in 2015 . by 2020-2022 the natural gas used to export will be 100 % aegean/ionian sea natural gas . 
  `` is greece in the drilling business now ? '', 
  absolutely they are when the 3 pipelines were `` green-lighted '' last month , 3 gas fields began drilling in western greece . 
  it is a joint italian/greek drilling project . 
  9 gas fields around crete were put up for auction this week for exploration . 
  norway gas explorers were given a contract to explore the central aegean sea area , outside of crete . 
  the latest news is that they have doubled their search request after early findings of massive gas reserves . 
  norway will be our main drilling partners in the central aegean sea region italy will be our main partners in western ionian sea eventually when we have the capacity and resources we will not need assistance from norway or italy , but that is likely to be another 10-15 years . 
  if i was in spain right now , i would be waiting in line at the bank to withdraw everything . 
  cyprus was small and easy to handle . 
  spain is a different matter all together, 
  everyone is america 's bitch . 
  including our own government, 
  after doing more research on that party . 
  nevermind my previous statement although it is good to have powerful debates with vastly different views . 
  it is better to hear them then just ignore it . 
  when did poroshenko become greek prime minister : o, 
  what is it with germany and incredibly gifted female leaders ? 
  this lady basically read my mind , and even risked her entire political career to tell the truth about ukraine . 
  just amazing .

  put-in or nothing, 
  i would n't mind them selling 30 percent of the company as long as it was required they invested a ton of money and upgraded the infrastructure . 
  preferably with solar panel technology . 
  otherwise hopefully the deal does not go through, 
  it has the ** potential ** to be , which many find the scariest part . 
  all it will take is an `` emergency '' and the firewall is completley up . 
  it seems like every western world government is preparing for major outbreaks of wars/violence while we sit glued to the tv watching the world cup and reddit, 
  * sips tea nervously * `` it was actually a requirement the entire time '', 
  was the company privatized already or is it still up for debate ? 
  it seems the deal has yet to go through . 
  one thing i have always wondered about a situation like this if the plane goes into a dive after something happens like tail/engine malfunctioning . 
  how hard would it be for someone to jump out the plane as it is diving ? 
  would it be possible at all to accomplish ? 
  the old castle of rodos city is the most pristine castle city on earth , never having gone through restoration as it has been perfectly maintained since it was constructed by the exiled knights templar around 1300 ad . 
  really fun place during the day and crazy . 
  seriously crazy nightlife in that castle city , bar streets on 1,000 year old cobblestone roads . 
  . it is by far in my top 3 favorite places in the world . 
  greece best tip do n't read this bullshit and skip athens and find your island . 
  and by find your island i mean that every person has a greek island that is their soulmate , each one is unique and most tourists feel really attached to a specific island most of the time . 
  this is the general definition  while the `` organic '' standard is defined differently in different jurisdictions , in general organic farming responds to site-specific farming and crop conditions by integrating cultural , biological , and mechanical practices that foster cycling of resources , promote ecological balance , and conserve biodiversity . 
  synthetic pesticides and chemical fertilizers are not allowed . 
  the difference between organic greek-made honey passed down methods for countless generations to mass produced shit-quality chinese honey that most europeans eat is massive . 
  greek honey is used as medicine ( literally ) . 
  and is attributed to living a long healthy life to greeks who live past 100 own words while non-organic chinese honey is not good enough to feed to animals ( imo ) and tastes like shit . 
  that is just an example of honey but you get the point .
