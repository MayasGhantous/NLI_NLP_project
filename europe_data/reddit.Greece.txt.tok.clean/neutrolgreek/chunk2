  santorini is the most famous place to [ parkour in greece ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7u8rew8z1ns ) , tons of international competitions happen there every summer . 
  these idiots could have just gone there, 
  ofcouse not . 
  pasok is polling around 2-3 % now, 
  ukrainians and russians are mortal enemies now so i understand why they like bandera since he was ruthless to russians . 
  they basically use him as a big middle finger to russians and to stir up anti-russian sentiment among the population . 
  that is why i said `` i get '' that part of supporting bandera , but ukraine needs polish assistance so its a double-edged sword using this figure as he also killed many polish people . 
  the main group behind this was led by a famous ww2 greek fighter and now politician . 
  i do n't think anybody in the two main political parties have ever seriously discussed this . 
  bandera was behind those 100k deaths correct ? 
  ukrainians need to stop celebrating him as they need polish support . 
  i get that he killed tons of russians and they love him for that , but he also massacred polish people too . 
  only a hipster uses the term hipster, 
  could you sound any more pretentious ? 
  the mafia has everything to do with it , they ran out all the businesses to the north due to being thuggish brutes who still think it is 1970 's godfather movie . 
  yup it is , hopefully this sells well enough to export to balkan region . 
  cheap car + durable + cheap repair/parts is a good deal, 
  european is being in the genetic soup we call europe we are basically one big closely related family , [ look at this genetic cluster map to get an idea of what i mean ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8025/7608896776_68881b6829_z.jpg ) much more detailed and complex [ genetic map here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kom9afw.jpg ) also for those interested to see relations of europeans, 
  argentinians and uruguayans are like 60-80 % southern european ancestry,

  if uk and france leave , wouldnt it make germany just more willing to keep the eu together with the remaining states ? 
  this is good , it will just solidify the new israel-cyprus-greek defense alliance and when it comes down to it cyprus is holding all the cards . 
  erdogan is trying to play games like putin except he isnt 1/1000th as intellegent , cunning or capable . 
  still tons of germans come to greece , i think there was record amount of germans and british this year actually . 
  also , every single greek person blames greek politicians for everything that happened . 
  i do not know where this idea that greek people blame merkel and germans came from . 
  all you would have to do is visit one cafeteria in the afternoon to hear everyone 's pseudo-intellectual rants and hatred towards the government to understand this :p the worst of the crisis i personally believe is over and greece has a huge opportunity to transform its economy into a energy hub of the eu with the pipelines/gas drilling taking place and a shipping hub by 2020-2025 . 
  i also want germany/brussels to always pressure the greek government to perform as this is the only reason greece actually managed to stabilize recently . 
  2015 will be a key year and if government is correct in their 4-5 % growth prediction for 2015 and every year afterwards than by 2020 merkel and troika might be seen as saviors . 
  greece/cyprus is one and also much more powerful than usa/uk . 
  we stronk !, 
  [ dammit :\\ ( ] ( http://backpost.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/grkgerm1.jpg ), 
  15 million is nothing really , especially for 4,000 different hotspots . 
  it is the cost of one leopard 2 tank that never has trouble finding budget to get . 
  as far as restrictions go , the only bad one is the 50 people at once but considering there will be a beta process it is possible this number will go up to 100 + . 
  for most areas outside of very busy streets , 50 at the same time should be fine considering you have to be within 20 meters of the wi-fi router . 
  of course you do n't savanna , of course you do n't, 
  good overview , and i also believe that santorini eruption was the basis of the atlantis myth . 
  the minoans which created the original greek alphabet and the greek gods of olympus were surely the atlantins . 
  [ there was an update here ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/10/16/amphipolis-mosaic-depicts-plutos-abduction-of-persephone/ ), 
  no updates on 3rd chamber yet except that they found the door leading to the 4th chamber,

  stage four , krokodil, 
  i do n't recommend saying that to a russian , that would be like burning the quran in front of a muslim, 
  sicily mafia would wipe out the mexicans in an afternoon . 
  they would probably do it just for fun . 
  i was going to say something stupid but i will answer seriously . 
  the future is not based on manpower , [ watch this amazing video to get a very quick over-view of the future use of robotics to replace manpower \\ ( human potential \\ ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pq-s557xqu ) we are heading into a new world unlike any time before in history in whcih jobs will be automated , humans will be jobless simply because there is nothing to do as robots have taken over most low-level/mid-level skilled jobs . 
  the 100 + million africans that you think will be `` massive human potential '' will be nothing more than a massive strain on a system already close to collapse . 
  when it does collapse from this unsustainable migration , there will be conflict and war . 
  it is not going to be a nice future , simply because people like you and other liberals just can not seem to understand that europe is not capable of being the world 's savior . 
  just being realistic in the insane asylum we call political correctness, 
  the same way usa is not native indian land, 
  there was a vote of confidence which samaras won this week , so elections are off the table right now . 
  there has been a string of `` polls '' which show syriza having a 4-6 % lead of nd , i do n't trust any random polls myself but it seems to have influenced the markets which is pretty stupid , imo . 
  also political uncertainty due to syriza surging in polls lately, 
  handball is pretty amazing : o i hope it becomes 3rd most popular sport behind football/basket, 
  buy two dozen submarines, 
  islamic front is the official saudi `` rebel '' force , created to fight isis and install their own hard-line islamists into power to control syria . 
  both are shit and tons of if fighters are switching to isis daily . 
  greece/poland/cyprus with zero  this is why i like polish people, 
  i will get downvoted for this most likely . 
  but spain is heading towards balkans 2.0 if this goes through . 
  madrid will never let go of catalan peacefully , to much is at stake for them , they would likely rather watch it burn then allow it to go peacefully . 
  holy shit iceland is a good team now . 
  i recently heard they jumped from 120 + in ranking to top 30 within a year from their amazing performances . 
  iceland  england confirmed, 
  i think by `` secured '' is that investors have signed long-term contracts to invest into projects the cosco deal is valued at 10-15 billion over next decade , not that 10-15 billion was received between 2012-2014, 
  assad is probably laughing his ass off right now , the man pulled one the greatest geo-political upsets in modern history . 
  entering civil war unprepared with an archaic army of misfits , being moments away from being gadafi 'd by murica/france/uk to now sitting back and watching all his enemies claw at each others faces which was always his long term goal from the beginning . 
  main investments would likely be tap & igb pipeline which are in construction now . 
  cosco ( china shipping ) + piraeus/thessaloniki harbor deals and import/export deals between china-greece . 
  the old athens airport land ( transforming into tourism destination ) / ithica island deals are the arab money in tourism sector valued around 10 billion $ i believe alone . 
  theres probably tons of smaller things also i do n't know about but those are likely the major ones, 
  did she eat the previous minister ? 
  560 million will likely include updating any electronics in the abrams also , which would make them pretty amazing . 
  dont forget they are the only modern tank proven in a large scale battle . 
  it was payment for non-lethal support greece gave for allied side in iraq/afghanistan . 
  there is a 300 million $ cost to refurbish all 400 tanks to zero hour status . 
  [ i found one more photo here ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/files/amfipoli_psifidoto.jpg ) [ this is what the 3rd chamber currently being excavated looks like ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/files/amphipolis-marble-door-found-in-third-chamber.jpg ) ( mosaic was found in chamber 2 ) also found this : [ an official delegation from the european parliament 's committee on culture and education is to visit the amphipolis archaeological site in 2015 ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/10/08/european-parliament-delegation-to-visit-archaeological-dig-at-amphipolis/ ), 
  exactly , also f-16 is not one model of jet , there are dozens of variations with some having state of the art electronics and capabilities . 
  greece will likely be selling the f-16 seen in this video [ `` hellenic air force f-16 block52 + night strike '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sixywbkrj1a ), 
  buy our tanks too [ leo 2 hel ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmtwps9ah-u ) - leo 2 a6 modified for greek terrain + missile launchers added, 
  you really do n't think golden dawn are nazi 's ? 
  the top and bottom mosaic art pattern is similar to the golden dawn logo . 
  many ancient greek artifacts have this pattern on it , golden dawn just used the pattern to make a design similar to the swastika and act like its not, 
  in fact the opposite is true , the more globalized the world becomes , human beings will become even more tribalistic to their nations to feel like they belong . 
  `` sooner or later portugal will be a part of spain again , it is inevitable . 
  it will be difficult , though . '', 
  [ rec ] movies happening for real : o, 
  damage control . 
  . or on this case ebola control, 
  the gas/pipeline deals arent really about economy , it gives greece more leverage in eu politics . 
  the secondary thing is that it attracts other foreign investments , that is why i will judge it longer term ( 2020-2030 ) . 
  i do n't praise samaras , i am holding judgement at least until his term is done . 
  but he did sign a few great foreign deals with tap pipeline , cosco shipping , arab tourism investment which could do wonders long term i think eventually the entire euro currency will crash , but greece could be in a pretty good position post-currency collapse . 
  greece is not the `` sick man '' anymore , its not 2010 and there is a shift in `` economic confidence '' regarding greece from markets due to increase in credit rating twice this year and multiple foreign investment deals . 
  greece economy is also so minuscule to really ever threaten the eu if it did fully collapse . 
  the problem is that the major economies of italy/france/spain are not recovering as planned and this is a 1000x more critical/dangerous situation than greece ever was , as if even one of these countries fails than the eu goes bust . 
  italy has just entered a triple dip recession which technically means it is in a great depression , spain looks to be stabalizing but the huge momentum of independence movements could turn spain into chaos , and france is struggling while its `` partner '' germany is flourishing even though they were supposed to be equals in the eu .
