  `` we want human rights . 
  we want the british and french governments to think about us , but nobody cares . '' what the hell more can they do ? 
  do they realize that northern europeans are the most generous people on earth to immigrants ? 
  go to china and i dare you to complain to anyone about treatment . 
  you will be lucky to keep your head . 
  more like german exaggeration filled with half-truths siesta culture - in south europe it is common to rest in afternoon due to heat , german spin is `` they quit work at 1 pm ! '', 
  truth = average work day for small-business owner is from 9 am - 1 pm then take afternoon off to rest/eat/relax / sexy time and then go back to work from 5 pm until around 10pm the reason is because afternoon is slowest time for business in greece , especially for small-business owners so they take afternoon off and go back to work and work late into night when there is alot of foot traffic . 
  corruption - as you can see from my links the greek government were corrupt and took many bribes from german ( and french ) military industry corporations to buy over-priced german military equipment . 
  . why do you think through all this austerity that germany demands we continue to spend wildly on military ? 
  in last 2 years there have been dozens of high-profile arrests and a massive crackdown on corruption on government contracts especially for military . 
  . changes in greek consitution to allow a 3rd party greek court look over contracts to make sure nobody is cheating money , and things such as this . 
  tax dodging - german spin : `` look at all those greeks tax dodging ! '', 
  truth is that the average citizen was not capable of cheating taxes . 
  the way the tax system was set-up pre-2008 was that a small-business owner would get around 10-12 major taxes to their business and would have to pick which ones to pay to avoid punishment . 
  the wealthy ship/hotel/club owners were able to avoid 100 % tax of any kind by just bribing . 
  this tax system was a mess and has been completely overhauled with a new modern tax agency + tax enforcement and taxes have been modernizes so instead of receiving 10 + major complex taxes which was inefficient , taxes have been streamlined and easier to complete . 
  social capital ? 
  - i am not sure what this means . 
  i will take a guess and think you mean the wildly inefficinet and corrupt public sector pre-2009 ? 
  this was the one thing that was 100 % true and since 2009 there have been over 300,000 people made redundant in public sector and a new grading system was put in place in late 2012 to grade public workers to make sure they are working for their government money , with salary or redundancy based on this grade . 
  the debt crisis is what caused the greek depression . 
  nothing to do with workers . 
  debt crisis  credit crunch  austerity  great depression was the order of events . 
  debt crisis caused by 30 years of spending like mad-men on military gear also greece still has 23,000 $ gdp per capita even during this depression , which is much higher than most countries in our area . 
  and greek economy is about to go on a massive boom between 2015-2020 if you have been following on some recent string of events . 
  i wonder how many lives he ruined to receive this, 
  99 % of tax avoidance is from ultra-wealthy types - hotel/ship/club / bar owners . 
  i would think a ukrainian would know this since it is the same situation there, 
  this ship is classified as something like a `` mini carrier '' - main purpose is not for defense but invasion of land, 
  i disagree , long shifts are hard when you can not have a social life because of it . 
  . alot of greek workers have to work from the early morning , to afternoon . 
  then have a short-break for a few hours . 
  adn then go back to work until sometimes past midnight , especially during tourist season . 
  this situation is among the most common during the tourist season in greece . 
  you literally have almost no time for a social life . 
  yes the work is not the hardest . 
  bartender/waiter/selling drinks/etc . 
  . but the hours are exhausting . 
  i would much rather take a nice comfy desk job in an air-conditioned swedish office building with a 6 hour work day, 
  shit government that caused it , yes . 
  to say that greece has `` lazy '' workers is false though . 
  you will find the same type of workers both lazy and super-productive in every country in europe , at likely the same ratio . 
  also i do not even know what `` lazy '' workers even means ? 
  i think this applies mainly to office work from my experience where you sit in air conditioned office just fucking around on the internet . 
  i can assure you that northern europeans fuck around as much as southerners in this regard . 
  that is the point i am trying to make . 
  even the easiest jobs like selling drinks to tourists is hard because you have to work very long shifts also that was one example , since my cousin works at the airport doing that . 
  the majority if not close to it in greece involves manual labor of some form + very long shifts . 
  the entire point i was trying to make was that even the absolute easiest/simplest imaginable job like my cousin has at the airport is tough because of the long shifts, 
  yes , but german tabloids were using it as a weapon to explain the debt crisis . 
  instead of telling the truth .

  long shifts are hard , no matter the actual work itself . 
  . that is the point . 
  i can never imagine going to aushwitz for vacation i dont want to feel like committing suicide on my vacation , lol, 
  that has always been the case every time i bring up greek working hours in past debates about this subject . 
  `` oh but your not productive like us ! '', 
  you sit in a cubicle all day looking at reddit !, 
  i agree , but all work is hard even if you are not being super productive , finding the next cure for cancer . 
  even just sitting at a counter , selling drinks to tourists is hard . 
  . not because of being `` productive '' . 
  but because you have to be at work for a really long time , on your feet . 
  alot of tourism sector jobs is not about completing a job , but just always being available for very long hours . 
  long hours at work is hard , speaking from experience . 
  long hours is hard work even the easy jobs like my cousin has at the airport where she sells drinks/candy to people is tough because you have to always be available . 
  not all hard work has to be hard labor or research science . 
  it will take decades to undo the poisonous stereotypes german tabloids made of greek workers . 
  i guess this is a decent start, 
  sparta cheapest place in greece and voted top 10 cheapest in europe amazing nature and history there, 
  bunch of fools, 
  do n't go to iran ~ ~ and insult their shit . ~ ~, 
  because nato base = massive american spying and drone complex thats main goal is to expand american power in the region and spy on europeans and has nothing to do with the security of europe . 
  they have not repatriated a single piece of gold . 
  that is why greece has been trying to get the gold or money back the last 60 years . 
  there is still a big push by greek government to get payment for this gold but it is usually met with harsh criticism so they have stopped trying recently, 
  [ more info ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/06/24/detailed-plans-for-the-ellinikon-development-project/ ), 
  this is not good . 
  1950 is a really long way from ww2 . 
  your a genius, 
  are you serious right now ? 
  germany stole 100 billion $ worth of gold from greece during their ww2 capture of athens . 
  ** forbes ** - [ with interest at 3 % over 66 years , that would come to at least $ 95 billion . 
  the problem is this : even partial recognition of such a debt would create a precedent that could bring untold claims in its wake .

  sure , why not, 
  like i said , i have zero problem with the country 's name , zero . 
  the problem is not the country name but the anti-greek propaganda they teach in school and brainwash the children with . 
  they do not believe the macedonians were greeks but a slavic race . 
  which if you know anything about history is insane to even think . 
  the period from alexanders death to the fall of makedon to rome was called `` the greek age '' . 
  the absolute peak of greek civilization and peoples . 
  they do not care about history . 
  they just really really hate greeks . 
  even more than turks hate greeks . 
  it is not just the name of the country . 
  i really could n't care less what they call their country if they were honest . 
  their entire education system starting from young children revolves around history books written by fyrom ` ian authors and not accepted anywhere else on earth . 
  these books teach that the greeks are horrible , evil history thieves that stole the land of the glorius fyrom ` ian people !, 
  do you not see the issue this could cause in the long-term future of both our countries ?
