  these people despise greece because they think the greeks stole their proud history . 
  they teach that the greeks have stolen their lands in northern greece and one day they will get them back and no compromise can ever be made . 
  they provoke greece by building massive statues of alexander the great and philip in town squares . . name their airport alexander the great airport and all kinds of crazy crap like this . 
  in an alternate reality where they accepted their actual history of their people and country , they would be a greek ally and protectorate . 
  we would have helped them in their upcoming crisis with their albanian population ( 40 % of fyrom is albanian ) which is causing massive riots and fights . 
  basically they hate the greeks because they have been brainwashed too and this hatred grows every day because of how they are educated . 
  and yet everyone blames greece for being stubborn with this aggressive country ? 
  it is not just about the name of the country . 
  it goes far deeper than this . 
  it appears the slavyansk rebels are the best armed and dangerous rebels , i believe that every helicopter shot down so far has been in this area . 
  it appears the ceasefire is over and hell is about to break loose edit - [ breaking : reports of battle in donetsk ] ( http://pressimus.com/interpreter_mag/press/3171 ), 
  why do you think nobody is stopping the 300,000 africans/syrians coming to italy form lampedusa this year and every year from now on ? 
  our ultra-capitalist society requires these people to feed the bottom of the economy so the wealth can continue to grow . 
  you stop these immigrants . 
  . the entire world economy collapses, 
  are you really surprised this happened though ? 
  fyrom will never join the eu as long as greece is in it . 
  this is the reality of the situation and we are already being kind to this country that insults greece by allowing them access to our sea ports which accounts for 80 % of their entire economy ( the same economy that supports building statues that insult greek history ) . 
  the queen would go on a game of thrones rampage . 
  i would not fuck with her . 
  you would fit right in the federal reserve , 
  it is even worse than you think . 
  not only did us steal the gold , they likely sold it to china/russia a very long time ago and no chance of ever getting it back . 
  and want to know why ? 
  the german gold is of the highest purity . 
  . when the germans molded the bars they made it to the highest absolute standard , around 99.999 % purity and stamped the giant eagle german crest on it and shipped it all off to murica . 
  2 years ago merkel got a little anxious and demanded at least some of the gold back , as a sign of good will and trust that the gold is still there . 
  guess what happened ? 
  they sent the germans a few tons of low purity crap gold !, 
  not even close to the quality of german gold . 
  to say the least . 
  . german government was a bit more than pissed . 
  here is the shitty part for germany though . 
  they can not do anything about it , literally nothing . 
  if germans bring this issue to court and it is found out that usa stole even one ounce of gold . 
  . the entire world financial markets will collapse into a black-hole . 
  wall street/london financial markets are based on trust , nothing more . 
  if it is found out that germany was tricked , the trust would be shattered and the markets along with it . 
  google - just type `` country '' gdp per capita and it shows the number . . but apparently that number is wrong . 
  i am not really sure, 
  you pretty much summed up what i was thinking , this election will largely be based on the current state of the economy in 2017 . 
  always had pleasant experiences with the irish myself, 
  that seems a bit extreme to me also . 
  do n't think i have seen a poll with less than 45 % support, 
  that gold was sold to china years ago and never going back anyway the only reason they gave up is because if they try to bring it to court it will cause a wave of panic in the financial markets ( which are based on trust ) . 
  it would cause a snowball effect that would end with the complete decimation the world economy , and yes it is that serious . 
  this is not some minor issue , gold storage is at the core of world financial institutions . 
  germany got fooled and lost their gold , you live and you learn . 
  not really fair to croatia though - their gdp per capita is decent at 13,000 $ with a population of 5 million romania/bulgaria is half that with 2-3x the population, 
  [ got that number here ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=how+can+i+send+a+pic+to+iphone&amp;oq=how+can+i+send+a+pic+to+iphone&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.2971j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=utf-8#q=ukraine+gdp+per+capita ), 
  the crazy thing is that ukraine is actually being considered to join the eu moldova gdp per capita - 3,000 $ and 3 million people ukraine gdp per capita - 3,000 $ and 50 million people to put it into perspective , greece which is in `` crisis '' has a gdp per capita of 23,000 $ and a population of 12 million edit : this is a pretty controversial comment , going from +10 upvotes to -1 and back up quickly . 
  you can downvote me and bury stories like this . 
  just do n't say you were n't warned . 
  ** channel 4 news london ** - [ the ` normal ' british teens who became isis jihadis ] ( http://www.channel4.com/news/the-normal-british-teens-who-became-jihadis ), 
  like the old days, 
  i dislike how the troika is `` angry '' at greece for not privatizing greek assets at a rapid pace as they want . 
  . luckily greek stubbornness has prevented our politicians from selling much and troika usually make a weekly statement how they are not pleased , 
  greece is not team up with either of those countries . 
  where did you get this info ? 
  greece is actually screwing russia right now by replacing them as europes main gas supplier by 2020 . 
  this whole `` orthodox brotherhood '' thing is vastly exagerrated , the only country in europe most greeks feel are `` kindred spirits '' with is italy . 
  also southern greece , full of waterfalls and mountain-top retreats and endless nature . 
  really great place for those looking for a greek vacation off the beaten path, 
  well the point was that ` greece is racist against jews '' . 
  . my point is that i do n't think it is bad since greece and israel have strong friendship between governments and israeli tourists love greece . 
  i do n't see that as teaming up , but even if we did . 
  why do you think that is so wrong ? 
  i 'm still lost at what you are trying to say ? 
  what was the culture shock ? 
  hiking mount olympus , at least for me . 
  i really want to do this soon . 
  you can actually reach close to the summit of the mountain without professional help or equipment , just need decent stamina . 
  the only section you need experience to climb is the final section of the mountain . 
  which i would never do since i hate heights  you can bring a tent and camp out there too , 
  putin is probably furious . 
  . like he was with the russian winter hockey team, 
  go back to playing with your legos , you sound like a schizo . 
  who is `` most of us '' ? 
  over 1 million israeli tourists came to greece last year without incident and my cousins who work in airport/tourism industry say that the israeli tourists are well-liked by the locals and vice versa . 
  i think the problem with greeks regadding jewish people is that they have almost never seen anything regarding israel outside the israel-palestine crisis . 
  but as israeli tourists come and our countries come closer together with pipeline/military cooperation it will get better, 
  young people love to party and there is nothing crazier than greek islands when it comes to late-night parties old people love the history , relaxing on beaches and quite areas and there is plenty of that . 
  each island has unique traits for different groups , like santorini is marketed to young/old married couples as a 2nd honeymoon destination ( or first ) , mykonos is marketed as a crazy night-life island and a place like rhodes is marketed as an all-around family island with things to do for young/old . 
  and then there are dozens of islands where people go to stay away from `` tourist traps '' and things like that . 
  the main tourism sector that is slowly being untapped is the `` ultra-wealthy '' category and greek tourism minister has been working aggresively to get these people to greece . 
  some examples is the new `` mini-monaco '' being built on ithaca island with a dozen uninhabited nearby islands being turned into luxury palaces by dubai royalty to rent out . 
  new f1 racetrack + surrounding resort area on athens harbor . 
  legalizing small private sea-planes for those rich people who hate travelling with us peasants ;p, 
  the great thing about greece is that there are hundreds of islands to go to and all these tourists have their own favorite islands or areas they like to go . 
  there really isnt a place like amsterdam in greece where everyone goes all the time . 
  . athens has lots of tourists but most of the tourists go to the islands . 
  just talk , putin has his eyes set on odessa and nothing will stop him to get this `` jewel '' he craves . 
  nice  we are also on course for new record with 22-23 million tourists this year . 
  minister of tourism 's goal is to reach 30 million by 2020 with new russian/israel and chinese tourism markets, 
  looks like nsa releasing these tapes to destroy this polish government not murica friendly = get destroyed, 
  most of those things are `` rubbish '' as you would say . 
  global language ( who cares , its not 200 bc ) , huge soft power ( like what ? 
  ) , historic links ( not good ones ) all your left is with your giant corrupt london financial center . 
  the same one that if a real market collapse happens after the financial bubble bursts ( google 700 trillion $ derivatives bubble ) . 
  if that bursts .
