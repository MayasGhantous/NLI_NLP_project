  there is potential if you have keeping up to date on some recent events here is some bits from the last 30 days only ** china-greece ** [ 1 ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/06/21/china-greece-get-close-samaras-li-visit-crete/ ) - `` chinese prime minister visits greece june 20 , sees greek shipping harbor piraeus as `` gateway into eu '' . . will make piraeus `` the most competitive port in the world .

  ** natural gas ** first greece lowered its gas contract with russia from 500 $ to 380 $ after improved outlook for greece in credit agencies [ greece `` green-lights '' 3 major pipelines , tap \\ ( azerbaijan  greece \\ ) and emp ( israel/cyprus  greece ) which will be complete 2020 and also igb ( greece  bulgaria ) which will be complete 2014/15 ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/06/02/twelve-energy-projects-worth-7-bln-euros-included-in-fast-track-procedure/ ) 3 lng terminals will be built alongside the pipelines and 3 gas fields in western greece have started in a joint italian/greek project alongside this pipeline deal [ greece to supply bulgaria and romania with gas , completely replacing russian gas in these countries ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/06/04/greece-set-to-negotiate-with-algeria-on-lng/ ) new deal will make greek energy exporter for 1st time in history as they use new igb pipeline , due to be complete by late 2014/early 2015 to supply romania and bulgaria with gas . 
  ( note romania/bulgaria will also buy this gas to supply smaller countries around them also ) is greece perfect ? 
  not even close , we have a long long way to go . 
  but there is alot of potential . 
  and investors are flooding back to greece for a reason . 
   the imf 's refusal to believe that greece would achieve a budget surplus before interest costs in 2013 led to a seven-month delay in the disbursement of crucial bailout funds , which in turn delayed the country 's return to the bond markets that has since fueled a revival in confidence and funding . 
    indeed , had athens capitulated to imf demands for further fiscal measures to meet the imaginary deficit , greece would almost certainly be facing a seventh consecutive year of recession . 
  as things stand , greece delivered a 0.8 % primary surplus last year and new data this week shows it is well ahead of budget for a 1.5 % surplus this year . 
  i still think yanukovitch is playing a major role in funding these militia groups in the east . 
  why do you think you have not heard anything from him since maidan ? 
  he is scheming and planning for his return to ukraine using these militia groups . 
  i am one of those people if russia was arming the rebels they wouldnt send in 3 broken down tanks from the 60 's . 
  they would send in an entire division of modern tanks . 
  i personally believe that yanukovitch is arming the majority of the rebels with the 50 billion $ he stole from ukraine . 
  what do you think he has been doing this entire time ? 
  yanukovitch also still sees himself as the legitimate leader of ukraine so in his own view , he is arming the `` actual '' ukraine army all i have seen from rebels is ak-47 's , mortars , rpg and manpad which could all have been looted from ukrainian stocks . 
  and there has been alot of looting of ukrainian army barracks in last few weeks/months . 
  world cup is far from over and greece played a decent game with some terrible luck on our side, 
  more importantly , greece vs colombia right now , 
  i 'll spare sweden if i can just take out london and leave the rest of england, 
  being logical , i would take out luxemborg since it would minimize deaths but in the moment i would still probably take out sweden . 
  one person who understands that nato needs us far more than we need them . 
  greece has options . 
  we could invite half the russian army to greece within a week if nato-greece relations dissolved . 
  this is a stupid idea though since greece is one of the few `` dependable '' allies for nato in the region, 
  i am neutral on russia right now . 
  the whole russia/greece `` orthodox brotherhood '' shit is over-blown and russia has rarely helped greece out in recent history if ever . 
  we only just managed to negotiate our gas price from 500 $ to 380 $ only last month after years of paying to much . 
  i would much rather be in a union with italy/france/germany than putinistan . 
  feeds you with one hand while sexually harassing you with the other, 
  where did you get the idea that nato will kick out one of the most strategically important countries on earth ? 
  and diego `` im 25 but look 45 '' costa, 
  i think colombia is obviously the favorites but if greece can finish our chances than we will win . 
  keep an eye out on kone + samaras left wing play and fetfatzidis in midfield . 
  some great talent in attacking this year . 
  already the best world cup ever greece vs colombia tomorrow !, 
  do you have a time machine to see what europe will be like in 50 years ? 
  africa is larger than usa/europe/russia and most of asia combined in land-mass . 
  there are only a few small areas where coloniasm had a negative impact . . the worst of course being the rwandan genocide which was caused by inept europeans playing games without understanding the long-term effects . 
  besides rwanda and a handful of other areas the rest of africa is largely un-touched , incredibly wealth of natural resources unlike any other place on earth . 
  endless amounts of fertile land for agriculture . 
  and yet all you see is starvation and death in africa with a few exceptions . 
  i believe greece is also fully supporting albania into eu from what i have read . 
  maybe because murica has tens of thousands of american troops still occupying german land ? 
  because usa has over a dozen of state of the art military operation headquarters in germany in whcih they use to operate their entire world-wide strategy ? 
  let alone that germany , if they wanted could break-away from the us/uk `` five eyes '' control and lead the eu to become its own super-power . 
  american `` diplomacy '' is an absolute joke . 
  this is a sure-fire way to piss off germans . 
  it is like sending that senile bastard mccain and his pet pitbull victoria nuland to ukraine to stir up maidan protestors so to piss of putin . 
  what ever happened to old-school diplomacy ? 
  everything seems like a drunken pissing contest in 2014 . 
  nabucco is dead , like ichbin said , tap ( trans-adriatic pipeline ) is the future . 
  tap will bring gas from azerbaijan through greece , across the entire northern greek region in a massive pipeline ( biggest of 3 pipelines currently being built in greece ) and greece will supply the eu with gas with this pipeline . 
  it is estimated that this pipeline alone will supply around 15-30 % of all eu gas needs for the next century . 
  the 2nd biggest pipeline being built in greece and also with eu-backing is the emp ( eastern med pipeline ) which will bring gas from the leviathan gas basin of cyprus/israel to greece . 
  the only problem is that the tap and emp will be fully operational in 2020-2022 . 
  in mean time , greece is building the igb ( greece-bulgaria ) pipeline which will be operational in 2015 and will provide gas to romania/bulgaria , for the time being using algerian gas supplies until greece starts its own gas exploitation in the aegean . 
  hopefully every country in europe goes gmo , since greece never will as we depend on our organic food exports . 
  more gmo countries = more need for greek organic food, 
  [ from russian tv video , translated by redditor ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/11/us-ukraine-crisis-gazprom-prepayment-iduskbn0em0fa20140611 ) the actual press conference is interspersed with news commentary . 
  i 'll translate both . 
  am = miller , nc = newscaster . 
  nc : it has not been possible to resolve the gas conflict through negotiation , said alexei miller . 
  seven difficult rounds [ of negotiation ] have come to nothing . 
  this means that if naftogaz does not pay the owed balance by monday , 16th of june , it will automatically be moved to a `` pre-pay '' system . 
  miller has stated unequivocally that there will be no more postponements . 
  am : gazprom needs to see in its [ bank ] account , before the morning of monday , june 16 a transfer of one billion , nine hundred fifty one million dollars . 
  otherwise , a system of prepayment will be enacted . 
  please note that the prepayment is not a stoppage of delivery of russian gas to ukraine , and not a limitation . 
  it is the delivery of gas to ukraine in the volume for which ukraine has paid . 
  if no payment is received , then consequently , the volume of these deliveries will be zero . 
  h-hour is 10am , monday , 16th of june . 
  nc : this firmness is explained by the position of the ukrainian side , which from the beginning has delivered ultimatums that it is willing to pay for gas , but only at the price of $ 268 per 1000 cubic meters , while the contract price is $ 485 . 
  the absurdity lies in the fact that the contract was signed by the very same people who have now come to power in kiev . 
  am : this is a very strange approach . 
  firstly , the ukrainian side is demanding pricing which only exists in the customs union . 
  the ukrainian side is demanding a [ removal ? 
  dont quite get this ] ban on re-export , which basically means that the ukrainian side wants to purchase our gas at bargain prices and then re-sell it to europe . 
  nc : the discount of $ 100 [ per 1000 cubic meters ] which gazprom has offered , was rejected by ukrainian pm yatsenuk , which came as a surprise to the members of the eu commission . 
  am : by this public declaration , the ukrainian pm has ended any further 3-party negotiation . 
  in fact , i think i would say that the ukrainian position is blatant blackmail . 
  nc : in response to the question of what gazprom plans to do if kiev carries out its threat to refer the matter to the stockholm arbitrage , miller responded `` to win the arbitrage and file a counter-complaint for non-payment '' . 
  thus the risk of theft of russian gas by ukraine remains and is very serious . 
  ** gazprom is already taking steps to prepare for the possibility . 
  the volume of gas being moved through the nordstream pipeline will be increased , bypassing ukrainian territory , and gazprom will continue construction of the south stream pipeline . 
  ** as alexei miller stated `` we have received no official notification of suspension of construction activities either from bulgaria or any of the other nations '',
