  everyone has bad-ass animals and greeks and italians have a duck and snail :\\, 
  the word cunt in the dictionary should have a picture of blair right next to it, 
  sicilian mafia if it was a corporation would be richer than apple , so i am sure that is also possible . 
  this happens when a single mafia family takes complete control . 
  the top mafia family boss acts like a judge and intervenes in different mafia family disputes during monthly meetings of all the bosses , they respect his decision and the peace is kept . 
  it happened like this in american-italian mafia for decades . 
  no , not at all - we are still one of the last countries on earth where monsanto/gmo is 100 % banned and will always be banned as greek government understands the importance of our organic food exports . 
  and there are literally tens of thousands of beaches in greece , i do n't mind if they lease out a few dozen secluded beaches to foreign investment as long as they build some kind of resorts for tourists to come . 
  i doubt the beach property sales will go through . 
  it has only been proposed and is facing stiff opposition from all sides . 
  nothing could destroy the beauty of greece and nothing ever will . 
  selling some shitty lottery company that barely makes money and some crappy bank that somehow loses money are un-important . 
  it says alot about greece that during the last 7 years of depression teh biggest `` privitzation '' complaints is of a crappy lottery company and a single un-profitable bank . 
  now that the worst is past us . 
  greece is building itself as an energy hub + shipping center and scientific/it `` silicon valley '' 3 major pipelines in consturction , potential of 20 trillion $ of gas in greek waters . 
  all profits already signed into law with 10 % going into science/it resaerch and 90 % going into norweigan style gas fund . 
  china building up two major shipping ports and cosco going to use these ports as there main base of operations in eu . 
  future is very bright if you see what greece will be like by 2020 . 
  german propaganda is up there with russia in many ways . 
  `` merkel in hitler costume '' was from a communist ( kke ) march with one idiot holding it . 
  thus now all 12 million greeks now consider merkel a hitler . 
  and who can forget your politicians making up lies about greek pensions , work-hours and countless other things . 
  also . 
  you seriously have no sense of humor, 
  i can see usa winning the world cup within the next 20-40 years the biggest problem usa has are un-experienced coaches in kids leagues/high school/college even mls who have never played a single minute of even semi-pro football . 
  alot of things are improving since klinsman got the job and as mls stars retire to coach in their hometowns . 
  i had a feeling that bosnia and greece would both make it to wc2014 when i saw the group last year . 
  dzeko is a beast, 
  no , 100 % about football english fans think greece won euro 2004 from some kind of witch-craft and that england could beat the greek team 13-0 . 
  i also have to many memories of english fans after the wc2014 draws saying italian nt was a joke and they would easily get past the group . 
  usa might surprise this world cup . 
  they have a tough group but they played incredibly well in their recent friendlies . 
  it will be hard since our group is so even , i think it all depends on the game against colombia in which colombia is considered the favorites to win . 
  if we can at least get 1 point from that game , we can likely manage to get a win from japan or ivory coast . 
  greece could potentially win all 3 games in the group . 
  but it could also lose all 3 . 
  that is why the colombia-greece-japan-ivorycoast group is so great . 
  all their midfielders are great goal-scorers and klose is amazing in world cup games . 
  i think germany can beat all those teams, 
  i do n't care if we lose 16-0 the very next game . 
  i just want us to beat those smug english !, 
  i actually have very high optimism for greek nt . 
  they are showing off a completely new team basically that has some serious attacking talent on top of our well-known defensive abilities . 
  kone + samaras left wing partnership is one of the best in the world cup and fetfatzidis has been incredible in midfield . 
  if we can tie or win against colombia we can get to knockout stages, 
  europe is going to look like a parallel universe in 2030 , compared to how it is today . 
  let alone 2050 . 
  tens of thousands ? 
  the fuck are you talking about fool . 
  italy had set 600,000 italian troops to greece thinking we would be an easy victory . 
  after their failed attack , we pushed them into albania where they attempted a counter-attack and lost again against 200,000 greek troops . 
  after this failure by the italians , they asked for assistance from germany who sent an entire land/sea/air division to take greece . 
  this stalled the invasion of soviet union by 3 months and stalin himself said that this was the main reason the soviets won the war . 
  none of these deals bother me except the beach one . 
  the plan to lease out 150-200 greek beaches is a bad idea and has already created major backlash since it was announced . 
  there is no way it will pass legislation as there is already a big fuss about it . 
  selling out some crappy bank to a group of investors is a smart move in the long-term and the lottery in greece is miniscule to other forms of gambling . 
  the only privitazion deals that bother me is when it comes to nature/land/etc . 
  some countries in south america privitized water companies and now are getting screwed . 
  selling beach property is not as serious as selling water rights . 
  but beaches are for the greek people and tourists to enjoy for free , so i am very much against it . 
  you know wire-tapping and secret recordings by nsa is serious . 
  . when you have to take a fucking row-boat into the middle of the lake to have a private conversation, 
  can you re-phrase that ? 
  do n't understand, 
  that makes no sense . 
  there is n't a department of dead peoples pensions & immigration that share a building . 
  also that story was found out to be over-blown propaganda when an actual investigation happened by the greek government [ relatives did n't declare people dead to keep receiving pension ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/05/12/relatives-didnt-declare-people-dead-to-receive-pension/ ) ** it was found that 2,999 pensioners had died at least six months before they stopped receiving their pension . 
  according to greek media , incorrectly paid pensions amounted to 57,127,388 euros , of which 37,797,425 euros have been repaid to the greek state either from the accounts of pensioners or by the joint holders of their accounts . 
  the search process for the rest 19,329,964 euros is still in progress . 
  `` time to send in a bunch of american psycho types with the face of a pitbull '' i think everyone can at least agree with that, 
  it 'll happen before 2030, 
  this is the 1st `` sanction '' , that actually means anything so far against russia, 
  sweden is the biggest `` nut-job '' in europe . 
  you think the riots in 2012 in sweden was the end ? 
  that was only the beginning of the long-term future of sweden by 2050 . 
  i do n't see how my links are not news , but thank you for your links .

  fyrom will never join the eu as long as greece is in it . 
  we can accept austerity and a great depression but we will never accept this country that spits on greece on a daily basis . 
  also they will not even exist by 2050 , after their war with albania . 
  so no point in even bothering . 
  where did i say `` excels at everything '' ? 
  it seems you hate every time i post anything that is even remotely positive about greece . 
  like i have told you many times before . 
  just because you have no future , does not mean greece also does not . 
  ( i am also assuming you are greek , which i used to think you are . 
  your cypriot right ? ), 
  [ there will also be a computer summer school hosted by cern in northern greece ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/04/14/kavala-greece-to-host-cern-computer-summer-school/ ) and in september a data-link will be connected to cern and a greek university to assist in cern 's efforts . 
  they also never chose to join ukraine after break-up of soviet union . 
  . it goes both ways . 
  if they truly did not want to be part of russia , you would be hearing about daily assassinations and guerilla war-fare in crimea , or anything at all really . 
  there is a reason only 3 people died during the invasion . 
  i think i can actually see joe biden 's hands up his ass and through his mouth . 
  crimea is gone , they should accept that if they truly want to find a long-term solution , they can sue russia in international court to get at least some kind of compensation though . 
  the crimean people are mostly ethnic russians and putin has made peace with the tatar 's with a deal to boost economic support and business of the tatar 's . 
  why would they choose to go back to ukraine ? 
  yup . 
  its funny how he blames eu for dragging usa in . 
  yet it was victoria `` american psycho '' nuland and `` lizard-face '' kerry who went into maidan and riled up the crowd for revolution .
