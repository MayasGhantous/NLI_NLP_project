  and ofcourse it is 100000 % coincidence that the vice-presidents son , hunter biden , joined the board of directors of ukraines largest energy corporation . 
  this is why they will never get more than 10 % of the vote in greece . 
  the 10 % of the vote they do get is mainly because of attracting athenian voters through those food & medicine programs and their extreme anti-immigrant stance . 
  i think they already hit their peak a few years ago, 
  the vase was shattered by eu , fine . 
  even though i do not agree with that . 
  what happened to fucking decent states-men in usa ? 
  country that produced great minds that created the country . 
  victoria `` dumb cunt '' nuland , is seriously the best you can fucking do ? 
  just to go there and antgaonize russia with no hope of creating a solution ? 
  putin offered a tripartite deal to usa/eu that ukraine could take part in eu and eurasian union , to make ukraine wealthy and a symbol of east/west friendship . 
  nope . 
  time to send in a bunch of american psycho types with the face of a pitbull . 
  your country is fucked if these stooges are the best you can take out for a situation like that . 
  dumb cunt nuland is not in the eu government , nor is lizard-face kerry and senile ol' mccain, 
  usa is responsible for everything that happened and is happening in ukraine . 
  wikileaks released a cable recently that stated usa was fully aware of potential consequences of civil war if nato spread into ukraine . 
  so what does usa do , fully knowing this ? 
  [ they decide to give an ultimatum to ukraine government pre-maidan to either choose eu/nato or choose eurasian union but they can not be involved in both !, 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/ue9julgc42o?t=3m10s ) ( linked video shows expert stephen cohen declare this is what caused the ukraine crisis ) putin counter-offered with a tripartite deal so ukraine could take part in both eu and eurasian union , ** it could have been the bridge between east and west ** . 
  what does usa do ? 
  they send in victora `` dumb cunt '' nuland with a bunch of cookies into maidan and send mccain to do photo-ops with nazis like right sector/svoboda leaders and rile up the crowd for revolution . 
  you are the reason of the shit-storm that is coming . 
  get the fuck out of european politics , you are fucking psycho 's sent to cause destruction and death to feed your fucking miltary industry . 
  note , i am not saying putin 's actions are ok . 
  i am only saying that usa knew this would happen and then instead of using this knowledge to find a long-term solution , they decided to run in head first and cause trouble with a bunch of dumb cunts like nuland/mccain/kerry sent to destroy ukraine . 
  you did not help with anything you fool . 
  after world war 2 the american psycho 's and the soviet drunks decided to play a chess game with greece and created a manufactured civil war that ** killed another one million people ** and led to the rise of a dictator in greece for 30 years that prevented us growing during the boom years of the 60/70/80 's . 
  exactly . 
  marshall plan was nothing more than a scheme to build up european infrastructure in exchange for making the dollar the worlds reserve currency and wall street the world capital of finance . 
  and i spit on the marshall plan for greece * spits * we lost 1-2 million people , complete devestation , un-speakable destruction . 
  and we received the lowest amount of money from the `` marshall plan '' . 
  even less than turkey who was not even involved in ww2 . 
  as far as greece . 
  there is a reason why murica signed a deal 2 years ago to give us 500 m1a1 abrams for free for helping out usa in their iraq/afghan wars . 
  it might not get much publicity but we provided a shitload of help in transportation , bases , supplies , logistics , etc in the last 10-15 years for your wars in middle east . 
  the greek people do not have much trust for american politicians though because most greeks blame americans more than turks for what happened in cyprus . 
  kissinger and all those other psychos pulled the strings and caused the cyprus mess which almost brought greece into a regional war for survival . 
  there is still trust issues because of this and i doubt it will ever go away . 
  in the end . 
  greece has always been on the frontlines of defense for european freedom . 
  never forget our contribution to ww2 and the millions of lives lost just so we could stall the enemy . 
  whereas other countries ( not giving names ) who were 10x bigger and 10x bigger army decided to surrender without a single bullet fired . 
  [ even merkel looks a bit uncomfortable ] ( http://pbs.twimg.com/media/bpcwsr8iaaapiqg.jpg ) source : https://twitter.com/maximeristavi/status/474883957406711808, 
  who are the `` quislings '' in hungary ? 
  you make it sound like there is an active war going in hungary , is it that serious ? 
  the main reason obama is saying this is because it will weaken uk 's position in the eu and likely make a brexit more likely . 
  the last thing usa wants is to have britain leave the eu and thus american influence in the eu . 
  greece and italy have been doing an increasing amount of joint-training exercises for air-force/navy/special forces greece/italy is a natural alliance for the future . 
  this has more to do with current geo-politics with russia/eu tensions , which is why i posted it here . 
  current major topic in eu is the south-stream deal between bulgaria-russia and the mistral class ship deal between france-russia . 
  and yes , i spend all day muttering to myself `` pipe deal ! '', 
  the igb and bulgaria/romania deal will not really change much , i agree . 
  the game-changers will be the tap and emp pipelines and the upcoming aegean sea gas, 
  future of air-warfare looks to be drones working in a cloud formation synced up to a f-35 computer system . 
  scramjets going mach 24 looks interesting . 
  but if there are scramjets than there will be scrammissiles with nuclear tips which is pretty frightening, 
  energy/pipelines/etc is important news due to russia-europe tensions and potential stricter sanctions . 
  bulgaria is currently being pressured by eu to not build the south-stream pipeline while russia is putting pressure on bulgaria to go along with the deal . 
  this is an interesting deal , considering these circumstances . 
  [ wallstreet journal - eu tells bulgaria to stop work on gazprom 's south stream project ] ( http://online.wsj.com/articles/eu-tells-bulgaria-to-stop-work-on-gazproms-south-stream-project-1401811829 ), 
  i saw the video of the rail gun before . 
  seriously scary weapon . 
  it is basically like having superman throwing steel beams at you from miles away . 
  i think this might actually be a slight jab towards merkel , it is hard to tell with putin . 
  i think so but not 100 % positive, 
  large battleships are basically sitting ducks against weapons like the yakhont anti-ship missile , that is true . 
  i think the future of naval warfare will mainly revolve around advanced mini-submarines ( germans make the best small subs on earth ) and also small mobile gun/missile boats that can fire off 30 + rockets in a minute when in danger , basically unloading everything it has and waiting as a sitting duck . 
  nice art-style  do n't get the meaning of the comic though and why merkel is holding a gun, 
  this is an interesting deal , basically since greece is building up its energy infrastructure , it has less need for the gas supplies from algeria . 
  thus , greece made a deal with algeria to buy 10x more gas from algeria than it usually does but at wholesale ( very cheap ) prices and supplying romania/bulgaria with this gas through the igb ( interconnector greece-bulgaria ) pipeline that will be complete in next 1-2 years . 
  the igb pipeline is the smallest of 3 pipelines currently being built in greece with the emp ( israel/cyprus  greece ) being twice as big as igb and the tap ( azerbaijan  greece ) being the largest with twice the capacity of the emp pipeline . 
  tap and emp are estimated to be fully operational by 2020-2022 . 
  which is why the igb pipeline is very important now as it will be complete by 2015-2016 . 
  he has a point , le pen is by far most likely to lead next elections hollande is hated and sarkozy is despised le pen has best chance to win , and has made her goal to abolish the euro, 
  crimea is majority russian land with the only warm-warmer port of the russian fleet , i can guarantee you that nobody in nato was surprised when it happened . 
  from my experience , brits make up both the best and worst tourists . 
  usually the under-24 crowd are crazy and piss-drunk all day . 
  and then you have just the sweet older british couples just wanting to enjoy the nature and relax . 
  what the hell did austria do recently ? 
  the useful idiot is being put to use already, 
  i do n't want a lizard in eu commission, 
  as in ready to join an alliance , not fight world war 3 alone . 
  greece has spent 350 billion $ in military since the cyprus invasion . 
  and has been training/preparing for war for decades . 
  3rd largest/modern tank force on earth next to usa/russia with 500 leopard 2 a6 ( the ferrari of tanks ) and over 300-400 leopard 2 a4 and over 1,000 various other tanks . 
  our air-force pilots are ranked in the top 3-4 on earth and routinely win the usa/israel/greece air-force competitions . 
  . and greece has become israel 's main training partner in recent years . 
  blue flag 2013 in israel with greece/israel/usa was the largest air-force training exercise in history . 
  we completley control the mediterannean with our navy , modern subs/gun-boats/misile launchers etc we are the only western country to have the s-300 - which is rated as much more advanced than the patriot systems ( which we have dozens of ) 250,000 trained and ready para-troopers - 1 million soldiers possible to be called up within a week 5-6 million total capable military men and woman if needed green berets/seals/rangers / search n rescue special forces divisions based on american groups of same name with same training methods . 
  i could go on . 
  . but when i say prepared . 
  i mean ready for full-scale war within 12 hours . 
  90 % of countries in nato have not even spent 1 % of gdp on military per year ( requirement is 2 % ) . 
  greece has averaged 4-5 % every year for the last 4 decades . 
  i can not say you are wrong considering that usually the greeks who are capable of doing innovative things , go to uk/germany/italy / etc for much better chances and salary . 
  but two things that will make a big difference is that greece is currently in the process of transforming from a shipping/tourism country to a energy hub alongside shipping/tourism/food production/etc . 
  greek government just `` green-lighted '' 3 major pipelines yesterday for contruction that will provide the entire eu with around 40-60 % of all natural gas needs for the next century . 
  tap , emp and igb pipelines alongside 9 other energy projects . 
  by 2020 , gas/oil drilling will begin extensively in greek waters as there is estimated to be around 10-20 trillion euros in gas/oil in greek waters government signed a law in january 2014 that makes 10 % of all profits go into science/military research and 90 % into a norweigian style gas fund .
