  militarily , greece is the only country in europe prepared for world war 3 and now greece is focusing on drone technology as they just signed a treaty with germany in october 2013 to build a fighter-drone by 2020  greece will be innovating in energy both traditional and renewables , nano-tech and drone tech 2020-2030 . 
  the difference between left-wing and right-wing multi-culturalism and diversity in a nutshell left-wing diversity = you go into a country that is a `` soup '' of nationalities and cultures with no `` official '' culture or group of people , every country is the same as every other , a giant `` soup '' of cultures . 
  tensions and riots are common as various cultures and religions clash . 
  right-wing diversity = every country has their own `` official '' unique culture , when you enter another country , you experience a unique and different and very proud culture and experience the history of the land and its people . 
  people get along as they all share a common unity am i wrong ? 
  right . 
  and you are 100 % makedonski !, 
  cmon now . 
  also , you know very little about genetic/dna studies . . it is one thing to scream from loudest podium about history . 
  it is another to do genetic/dna studies which have been extensively done in greece and find that the genetic continuity form ancient to modern greeks is `` striking '' according to a western geneticist . 
  this is a greek - http://media.ufc.tv//fighter_images/elias_theodorou/eliastheodorou_headshot.png tina fey , john stamos , vangelis , mike zambidis , jennifer aniston , zach galafanakis etc have a classical greek facial structure . 
  i could go on if you like . 
  oh , and in dna studies these `` macedonians '' from fyrom have a 99.99 % identical dna structure to bulgarians . 
  and when you combine the fact taht they speak a bulgarian dialect . 
  it is not hard to see where they came from . 
  greeks have stayed insular and xenophobic and have gone to countless wars with our neighbors to protect our heritage and blood-lines . 
  . and soon we will continue this tradition . 
  no , thank you , 
  you have no idea the amount of hatred and propaganda spread by `` fyrom '' towards the greeks . 
  you can not even google for `` macedonia '' without being bombarded by multiple anti-greek propaganda websites ( try it ) . 
  that claim greeks had nothing to with makedon . 
  etc i could tell these idiots that after alexander the great died , the next 250 years was the peak of greek civilzation known as the `` hellenic age '' as macedonia became the greek capital of education and culture and macedonia monarchy led all free greeks in four major wars against the romans over these 2-3 centuries until the fall of makedon in 148 bc ( the historical date when free greece lost its freedom to rome ) i could tell these people that the greek city-states stopped being alligned to their local cities like makedon/athens/sparta / etc and created the modern greek person who share a common culture . 
  . and the idea of `` pure '' macedonian/spartan/etc has ceased to exist since 148 bc . 
  they do not care about history . 
  they only care about spitting in the face of greeks . . and they will understand soon why greece dominated the world for 5,000 years . 
  2013 was the first year that the bail-out fund made profit with 1 billion euros - http://www.dw.de/german-bank-bailout-fund-posts-first-ever-full-year-profit/a-16809503 considering that the bail-outs will be raking in money over the next 50-100 years , it will be multiple billions a year in profit from now on . 
  bail-outs are big business . 
  this video does not represent anything with the islamic community in europe , one way or the other . 
  you would have to be completely insane to enter this protest after the jewish shooting , knowing full well an isis affiliate possibly did the shootings . 
  i am surprised that even more than 2-3 people showed up , considering this was basically nothing more than a suicide pact . 
  also , isis is still a very minor player in islamic extremism , and signs of it entering europe like this video is very worrying as there are signs of it being accepted instead of tossed away like many expected . 
  simply hellene/hellenic/helenos / helena/etc is the greek word for greece greece/grecia/greko / greichland/etc is the latin/roman word for greek most countries a long time chose the latin word for greece . 
  except ggn - good guy norway edit : yunan/yunanistan = ionian/land of the ionians,

  italy alone is expected to get 100-150 ,000 this year total amount for all europe countries is around 500,000 refuges in 2014 and growing every year . 
  when it comes down to it . 
  to quote george bush jr. `` you are either with us or against us '' make your choice . 
  you are either with greece and a friend of the greek people on this issue or you are our enemy . 
  there is no in-between . 
  greeks are willing to die for this if it comes down to it , we are tired of this bullshit so we can be `` politically correct '' the fact is that if this `` fyrom '' a make-believe country existed 150 or even 200 years ago they would have been destroyed to dust by the greeks . 
  they are lucky they `` discovered '' they were `` pure-blood '' macedonians ( lol ) in the age of un and treaties . 
  it is easy for a swiss person to say that considering you just passed a law , making immigration to your country nearly impossible while other countries in the must take in all these refugees . 
  also italy alone will get around 100-150 ,000 refugees this year from africa . 
  the total number of illegal refugees going through eu borders is around 500,000 this year and this number is exponentially growing every year . 
  nothing worse than propaganda against greeks last few years . 
  bailouts = charity for lazy greeks !, 
  although bailouts = 10 % interest loans that have already given massive profits to german banks greeks work longer hours on average ( but of course not hard according to propaganda ) . 
  even though everyone i know and live by in greece works there hands to the bone every day to get food on the table . 
  all greeks think merkel is a nazi and all have paintings of merkel in nazi uniform in every home ( seriously germans believe this ) . 
  because some communist idiot in a greek protest had this portrait . 
  . and then printed on thousands of german tabloids . 
  so many things . 
  the region of northern greece is and has always been called macedonia , with a population of 3 million greeks who identify as greek-macedonian , twice the population of fyrom ( even including half their population that is albanian ),

  this is after the major deal in november 2013 for a section of athens harbor for chinese shipping giant cosco . 
  it looks like cosco is interested in a section of thessaloniki port and more maritime co-operation between chinese and greek shipping corporations .

  [ koum-kan ] ( https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=1006030109333 ) in greece , really fun game . 
  it is one of those easy to learn but hard to master type games  koum kan is a rummy game from greece which can be played here by from two to four players . 
  through drawing and discarding , the players try to meld ( lay down ) their 10 cards by forming them into sets of equal ranked cards and runs of consecutive cards of a suit . 
  the hand is won by the first player who melds all their cards in this way - this is known as calling up . 
  all the other players score penalty points for the cards remaining in their hands . 
    anyone who accumulates more than 100 penalty points over a series of hands is eliminated from the game , unless they buy themselves back in by paying a new stake into the pool . 
  when all players but one have been eliminated , the last surviving player wins the game and takes the money in the pool . 
  half right/wrong saudi arabia government does not only not fund isis but they are extremely scared of them and their potential spread into saudi arabia . 
  just last week the saudi government arrested a group of suspected isis affiliates [ saudis fear syria blowback after discovering isis cell ] ( http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/05/isis-saudi-arabia-qaeda-terrorism-syria.html# ) now the part where you are half-right , is that there are saudi elites privately funding isis , but the same can be said for nearly a dozen countries who have wealthy citizens funding isis in secret . 
  isis is so powerful , because they do not rely only on private donations like every other jihadist group in syria . 
  isis control thousands of kilometers of land in syria/iraq and take in tax money from locals , sell off gas from gas drills/pumps they control and take part in kidnapping/randoms/etc for money and many other things . 
  that is why they are called islamic ** state ** of iraq & syria . 
  they are an actual state , who see themselves at war with the `` bourgeois '' saudi government . 
  the isis ultimate goal is to capture the crown jewels of islam , mecca in saudi arabia . 
  they openly state this in their propaganda videos . 
  the saudi government created their own personal `` syrian rebel '' army in the [ islamic front ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_front_\\ ( syria \\ ) ) the islamic front 's main goal is to kill isis , not saa/hezbollah there is a war between wahabism ( islamic front ) vs isis and most european fighters are joining isis .

  you make it seem that only wahhabis are prone to jihad in syria , when in fact this is absolutely not the case . 
  every mosque , no matter which specific version of islam they preach is extremely sympathetic to the jihad in syria . 
  ** the # 1 destination of european jihadi 's in syria is the group known as isis ( islamic state iraq & syria ) also known as isil or daash . 
  ** the isis are at war with saudis and wahhabism , so right there your point is thrown out the window . 
  wahhabis are a big problem . 
  but they are only the most obvious problem for those ( such as yourself ) who do not see the true depths of this issue in europe and where it will soon be leading us .
