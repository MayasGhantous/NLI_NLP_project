  you think alot about that ? 
  that is a very scary drop , triple dip drop right into 1968 levels . 
  i knew the construction bubble was large , but this really puts it into perspective . 
  these people define the term [ cognitive dissonance ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cognitive_dissonance ), 
  i love how passionate med countries are about food especially greece/italy/france . 
  we get very emotional about this type of stuff, 
  i am really worried that odessa will end up a bloodbath for both sides . 
  ukrainians seem to have drawn an internal `` red line '' through odessa and they might throw millions of bodies to the fight to prevent losing it, 
  if we somehow beat you tomorrow , there must be some kind of curse for portugal against greece, 
  do n't forget we are playing against each other tomorrow, 
  freedom fries would become eu law if that happened, 
  10-15 billion euros a year is a possibility but it would only be able to support the western pro-eu ukraine cities not the russian-dependent industry of the east where almost 10 million are employed as cheap russian labor . 
  the miners in donetsk have already risen up today and warned of going on the attack against ukraine army . 
  if that happens , then i think there is no chance that ukraine will stay unified country . 
  but in the end , losing the east of ukraine might be worth it for the ukrainians in the long-run . 
  you split up the two groups that hate each other and all eu money can be spent on western cities . 
  ** we would be the biggest players in eu parliement by 2050 due to our size . 
  ** this is the main reason, 
  belgium has a solid chance of reaching the final 8, 
  i 'd still rather be in poland , no offense . 
  speaking for greece , the eu has done amazing things for greece and it is only the beginning . 
  i remember early/mid 90 's the atrocious state of greek infrastructure/roads/highways / trains etc . 
  now greece infrastructure feels like one of the best in europe with modern roads/highways supported by eu . 
  constant on-time ferrys to go between islands ( somehwat supported by eu ) and one of the best subways on earth in athens ( i think partly supported by eu but not sure ) . 
  our tourism since joinin the eu has skyrocketed and in last 4 years we have broken records for every quarter in a row . 
  this year on track for 22-25 million tourists ( previous record is 20 million/twice population of greece ) greek people feel secure and safe with eu military alliance and investments has been pouring in from china/middle east the last year as things stabalize . 
  you would have to be insane to choose russia over eu . 
  as much faults as the eu has , it is nowhere near the insanity of the `` eurasian '' union, 
  june is officially fuck russia month lol i really hope brussels ( belgium ) does n't beat russia in their world cup group or we might have a world war right afterwards, 
  could have showed greece also 1 million dead , 10 % of population after ww2 - manufactured civil war between communism and west 1 more million dead 10-12 %, 
  i am not 100 % convinced honestly . 
  first , it was known that nobody in ukraine wanted a 2nd run-off election between poroshenko + 2nd place person . . which would have happened if poroshenko received less than 50 % of the votes . 
  it would have delayed another election for nearly a month in which yatsenyuk would continue to fuk up the country . 
  and nobody wanted that . 
  there was cleraly a nation-wide movement between all parties , nazis and the like to vote for poroshenko . 
  and a nazi vote for svoboda or right sector would have been useless regardless so no point in voting for them for president . 
  the fact is that there are marches with tens of thousands of people holding torches and nazi symbols on flags . 
  and most of them voted for poroshenko . 
  this does not mean they are not nazis, 
  that sounds like a fun night, 
  i do n't disagree with that statement , but one thing you need to realize is the difference between turkish and greek assimilation in ottoman times . 
  turks were aggressive assimlators of those they conquered in anatolia . 
  this is how they went from small turkic tribes numbering 3-5 million people 500 hundred years ago to 60 + million today . 
  while for example in greece it went from 3-5 million 500 hundred years ago to 10 million today . 
  this is because to assimilate into ottoman empire , all you had to do was follow islam , which hundreds of thousands of greeks chose to do , so they could avoid the jizya tax/persecution and eventually genocide in early 20th century . 
  while the greeks within modern greek borders stayed very isolated and xenophobic . 
  and ofcourse a turk/muslim could not assimilate into greek culture during these times , as this was punishable by death . 
  sharia law which was the law of the land prohibited this, 
  i think tobacco plays a far bigger role in greece since we are # 1 smokers in europe . 
  while in eastern europe , alcohol abuse leads to increased risk of heart attack, 
  if you are basing on purely skin-tone then yes it would be hard to distinguish , but greeks and turks have unique facial structure traits that is easy to tell them apart . 
  here are some common male greek `` appearance '' [ john stamos ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/johnstamoshwoffeb2012.jpg ) [ mike zambidis ] ( http://www.ironmikezambidis.com/img/images/1105_k_1max_070.jpg ) [ elia theodorou ] ( http://ficassets.fichub.com/fx_au_au/character/145752.281x308.jpg ) [ zach galafanakis ] ( http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2009/news/090622/zach-galifianakis-240.jpg ), 
  greeks do not have a common skin tone across the board . 
  for example , crete/southern peloponeese and a few other southern islands where the average temperature is extremely hot , skin tone is olive toned , especially in crete who have a very distinct skin tone/facial structure . 
  in athens/northern peleponeese , skin tone is lighter while in macedonia region , most people are pasty white skin tone especially if they do not go on vacation to southern greece . 
  as for turks , i 've met many who are very white skin tonned and others dark olive like in greece so it is similair . 
  it is the same for example in iran where most people are very white skin toned . 
  especially the non-arab persians . 
  same goes for italy - sicily/southern italy boot = olive skinned while north italy = pasty white . 
  as far as for why people consider greeks white and turks `` non-white '' - it is simply because `` white '' has gone from meaning a skin tone to meaning a culture . 
  white = christian , western , european culture while non-white = eastern culture, 
  genetic markers does not mean much , for example greece/italy/balkans / turkey and pretty much every country from europe to eastern russia share a genetic marker ( forgot what its called ) with varying amounts of percentage . 
  for example greece/italy has like 25 % , serbs have like 15 % , turks 10-15 % , russians 40 % etc greek and turk dna are vastly different according to modern dna research in western universities but certain genetic markers do exist but same can be said for dozens of countries along with greece . 
  that article does n't seem to work for me . 
  and i do n't think it has ever been changed . 
  i have never known anybody to retire before 60-65 . 
  most 70 + year olds i see also help out with family business and never truly retire . 
  fun fact : greece and germany teamed up to build the [ leopard ii hell ] ( http://greekmilitary.net/greek%20armoured%20core/jn03005ed7.jpg ) . 
  it is a modified leopard 2 a6 , built in greece and created to maximize usage on greek terrain with modern upgrades greece also signed a contract for 500 m1a1 abrams in 2013 , not sure which is better though . 
  exactly . 
  proto-types are called that for a reason . 
  also , the idea of a `` stealth '' tank seems silly to me in general . 
  and likely insanely expensive for a feature that has little value, 
  [ the average retirement age of greece is 65 ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=retirement+age+greece&amp;oq=retirement+age+greece&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.2017j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=utf-8 ) i bet you think it is like 45 right ? 
  i ca n't disagree with you it does seem to be happening at a faster pace , eventually there will be a complete financial collapse in usa that will trigger a world-wide collapse . 
  the only question is what happens after this event and will the eu manage to use this once in a century opportunity to take the leadership role in world finance ( hopefully without uk bankers ), 
  good job romania , 
  most experts believe that the next `` august 2008 '' event will happen within the next decade . 
  nothing has changed since that day , no real laws made . 
  literally within 2 hours of complete world-wide financial collapse . 
  and nobody seems to have cared . 
  2020-2030 is going to be a revolutionary decade , imo, 
  national pride + refusal to surrender are same for greece . 
  our official world war 2 holiday is called `` oxi day '' or `` no '' day which is the famous response the greek leader gave to mussolini when he politely asked us to surrender  200,000 greeks with ww1 equipment beating 750,000 italians and then immediately after that was full-scale war with germany which we lasted a few months to postpone their russian invasion into winter . 
  and greece * greek diet is one of healthiest on earth with constant access to beaches for relaxation and exercise . 
  the thing that hurts greece the most is that we are biggest consumers of tobacco in europe . 
  and greece are biggest smokers in europe . 
  greek government really needs to start some programs to help with smoking problem, 
  butter is not healthy, 
  yeh , same in greece, 
  lagarde is the best case for lizard-people theory to be true, 
  i think uncontrollable escalation has started it went from 2 weeks ago , protests and grandmas stopping trucks in the middle of the road . 
  to now full-scale battles involving hundreds of men . 
  honestly quicker escalation than i anticipated and i was very pessimistic from the start . 
  expect things like this to happen on a daily basis now , it is rumored that the rebels have over 35-50 ,000 men in arms with around 100 new recruits a day ( according to rebel commander ) . 
  this is not the end of the war , it is the beginning . 
  `` greece can provide 25-50 % of all gas needs '' is true , but let me explain . 
  i am not saying greece itslef contains the gas within its own territory to provide up to 50 % of gas needs for eu . 
  only that greece will be the `` hub '' of 50 % of the gas going into eu . 
  there are 3 pipelines currently in the works , two of them major european projects .
