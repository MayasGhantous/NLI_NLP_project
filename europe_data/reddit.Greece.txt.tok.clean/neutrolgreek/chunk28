  the tap , the biggest pipeline will connect the eu to the massive gas fields of azerbaijan 's caspian fields . 
  the caspian fields of azerbaijan will easily provide up to 15-20 % of all eu 's gas needs on its own with the tap pipeline which is being built across the entirety of northern greece to feed eu its energy needs . 
  the second major pipeline is the eastern mediterreanean pipeline which will bring gas from the leviathian basin of cyprus/israel to eu through greece . 
  the leviathian gas field is estimated to provide around 10-15 % of all gas needs . 
  now greece itself has enough gas within its own waters to provide up to 10-15 % of gas needs potentially . 
  so the combination of the pipelines + greek gas fields could one day equal up to 50 % . 
  but even if its 25-30 % it will still be a game-changer . 
  well communism was meant to be a `` utopia '' where all people live equally wealthy with an extremely high living standard . 
  at leas the theory portrayed it that way . 
  it is possible that science advances to the point where scarcity is no longer an issue and everyone can live with a high living standard . 
  soviet communism was a fascist state with a capitalist black market that accounted for nearly 50 + % of trade in soviet times . 
  they are the `` rebels '' not terrorists . 
  when uk/usa supports them they are always rebels . 
  same way poroshenko is a tycoon and not an oligarch . 
  monsanto/gmo/etc 100 % banned in greece - also we do not important cheap/gmo products from other countries than put a greek sticker on it and ship it off like some other countries , such as this example [ greek beekeepers become latest casualty of european gm labelling war ] ( http://www.thepressproject.net/article/54934/greek-beekeepers-become-latest-casualty-of-european-gm-labelling-war )  however the recent european parliament vote on the issue of honey labelling has been described as a setback for greece 's beekeepers , favouring german companies importing large quantities of cheaper , lower quality honey from countries outside the european union such as canada and china . 
    `` it puts us at a competitive disadvantage , '' ms karatasou said . 
  `` the advantage of greek honey is that about 90 % of it comes from natural ecosystems in non-cultivated land from beekeepers who move their bees from place to place . 
  this means that the quality is exceptional but we can not compete on price with the large honey producers . 
  labelling allows consumers to choose quality . '' all greek honey is by default gmo free given that gm crops are prohibited from being grown in the country . 
  vegan propagandists apparently, 
  soviet union was to communism what democratic peoples republic of korea ( north korea ) is to democracy, 
  the eu will never fail as long as germany stays in it , and germans are possibly the most pro-eu nation next to belgium, 
  greece has 10 % extremists with golden dawn syriza although idiots are not extremists, 
  hollande should not be allowed to manage a mcdonalds . 
  let alone a country like france, 
  1st , i have absolutely no issues with fyrom calling themselves whatever the hell they want . 
  my main issue is that the propaganda education in fyrom teaches fyrom children that greeks are evil `` history thieves '' , they are enemies of fyrom and fyrom ` ians are the true macedonian blood !, 
  this is non-sense since macedonia ceased to exist in 148 bc . 
  no modern greeks say `` we are 100 % spartan ! , or 100 % athenian ! , or 100 % macedonian ! '', 
  because it is non-sense . 
  all these greek cities mixed together during byzantine times to create the modern greek person who is a mix of all the greek city-states . 
  also , fyrom territory does not contain even 1 % of the land of the ancient kingdom of makedonia . 
  again i have no issue with what they call themselves , but i just wnated to point that out . 
  and lastly . 
  they can not enter nato or eu because greece will veto every single time . 
  they are a mico-state whose entire economy depends on greek shipping ports which they are lucky to get access too and enjoy . 
  an agressive nation who spits on greek history will never enter the eu as long as greece is a member . 
  we have veto power and we will use it until this `` fyrom '' ceases to exist . 
  which will happen latest around 2040-2050 in the upcoming albania vs fyrom war that is brewing up . 
  i doubt it, 
  well said , treating immigration as a racism test is what caused this rise in far-right in europe, 
  it is . 
  but this wo n't stop israeli media portraying every single citizen of germany today as flag-waving radical nazi 's . 
  german-israel relations are going to get interesting with this bit of news , it is obviously insignificant but it will be blown out of epic proportions . 
  it is now within the realm of possibility that uk and france will leave the eu . 
  i still do not think the eu will completely dissolve without both countries as germany seems intent on keeping it together , but the future of the eu seems very very uncertain at this moment . 
  the trillion dollar gas fund is sometimes called `` social security fund '' , at least in certain articles . 
  i know this is not the same as the pensioner fund . 
  eu parliament is going to get alot more entertaining with front national/ukip/syriza being major players now . 
  maybe this is the kick in the ass pro-eu parties needed to really get to work and put in reforms . 
  most people in the 1980 's even 90 's thought the idea of norway being a gas producing country were not only delusional but insane . 
  now it provides around 40 + % of their gdp and they have 1 trillion $ in a social security fund with no end in sight . 
  samaras signed a law in early 2014 that made it so all gas profits will be split up with 10 % going into greek scientific research projects and 90 % going into norweigan style social security fund ( samaras hired same norway team who created theirs ) i bet you will still curse out samaras for whatever insane reason you have . 
  do you honestly think your useful idiot hero tsipras would do that ? 
  he would steal all the money like his pasok masters and sponsors and create a failed state . 
  greece is positioning itself to be the main energy pillar of the eu by 2020-2025 . 
  the two major ( and one minor ) pipelines currently in devlopment are tap and emp with the minor being the interconnector greece-bulgaria ( igb ) the tap which will be complete by 2018-2020 will bring gas from azerbaijan and could provide up to 15-20 % of all europes gas needs for nearly a century . 
  the emp pipeline will bring gas from the leviathian gas basin of israel/cyprus and will provide around 10-15 % of eu 's gas needs for just as long . 
  those two things alone will greatly help greece as greece currently spends around 8-10 % of total gdp to import over-priced gas/oil from mainly russia , so this will free up to 4-5 % of gdp . 
  the real hope for me though is greece 's potential for its own gas reserves within greek waters , some estimates put the number anywhere from 5 , 10,15 or even 20 + trillion $ of potential reserves . 
  what little is known so far is that crete alone has around 1 trillion $ minimum of gas around the island alone . 
  . this alone will help pay off debt + boost investment in many sectors of greek economy . 
  the only bad part is that we will have to wait until 2020 to start profiting from this . 
  so next few years will continue to be a bit of a struggle but by 2020 greece will have an economic boom . 
  i did simplify it a bit but you are right . 
  through-out history there has always been `` tribal '' mentality even if not in tribe . 
  for example in greek byzantine era , the tribal mentality of greece was greek-orthodox was civilized and everyone else was a barbarian and an enemy . 
  greek islands are the main reason to go to greece !, 
  although i would dedicate 1-2 days to visit acropolis and the new museum there if you enjoy greek history . 
  if not interested in history then just go straight to islands . 
  i found this german language ad for greece - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thihtipdxxk greek islands are easily the best place in europe to vacation , nothing else like it on earth . 
  thousands of islands each with unique traits , some islands are hardcore party islands , others are laid-back quite destinations for honeymoons and many are a mix of both . 
  endless amounts of things to do and it is very easy to avoid tourist traps and create your own unique vacation, 
  a number of reasons . 
  first and foremost putin calculated that there would be little to no bloodshed from his silent invasion by the `` polite men '' ( slang term for spetnaz who invaded crimea ) . 
  and he was right , only 3 people died in total from this invasion and he captured the entire region nearly overnight . 
  as to why he took crimea , there are a few reason but the major two are that he needed crimea as it was the location of russia 's only warm-water port during winter and in general stored massive amount of russian military and technology and secondly there is estimated to be trillions of $ worth of gas/oil to be taken from crimean waters . 
  so putin calculated risk ( damage to infrastructure and deaths ) was worth potential gains ( military base + gas/oil ), 
  even better , simpler and cheaper . 
  every classrom in eu should have a standard 40-50 inch hd-tv with built in skype . 
  one hour a day every classroom interacts with another classroom somewhere else in the eu and every day it is different . 
  before nationalism , there was certainly tribalism . 
  for example in ancient greece , sparta/athens/macedonia etc were giant tribes known as city-states that were constantly at war with each other . 
  i am sure in scotland during ancient times there were very big tribes that were constantly at war with each other and the same goes for every country . 
  the modern nation is a relatively new concept so nationalism does date back a few hundred years whereas before that it was pure tribalism . 
  because pro-russians feel discriminated and abused ( not my opinion , just giving a reason ) also , i saw a video yesterday of pro-russians destroying the ballot papers while laughing maniacally at the only real choice for prime minister , the chocholate oligarch billionaire poroshenko . 
  it is funny to them that maidan kicked out one corrupt evil oligarch just so they could vote and die for another one . 
  the thing with putin is that you have to read `` in between the lines '' of all his recent actions to fully understand him . 
  he is like a chess grandmaster at geo-politics and each move is incredibly calculated . 
  i will download it when available , just checked and nothing online yet, 
  you can have mussolini 2.0 . 
  just do n't try to invade us again !,
