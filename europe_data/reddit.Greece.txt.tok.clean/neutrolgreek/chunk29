  ramos the great, 
  turkey would be in a civil war within 2 weeks of a war with greece . 
  the only thing i will say is this , the best weapon greece has right now is that we are under-estimated . 
  greece was never involved in that , only cyprus . 
  that is why there never was more than a few skirmishes and greece has spent a total of 300-350 billion in military equipment and infrastructure since the invasion and we are in the eu . 
  i could go into more detail . 
  but that is why i am not afraid honestly . 
  greece controls the aegean , that is where this hypothetical war would ever take place anyway, 
  i like dogs and turkey 's too though :\\ and there is nothing to fear of turkey, 
  i just like chinese food, 
  football fans rally in support of poroshenko , the chocholate king * i would support the ukrainian side much more if the choices for elections was n't such a comedy . 
  you kick out yanukovitch . 
  and then you try to replace him with the richest man in ukraine ? 
  and then you appoint half a dozen billionaire oligarchs as governors of eastern ukraine regions ? 
  you basically kicked out one evil corrupt piece of shit so you can vote another one in and you are willing to die for them also which is the saddest part, 
  pokymonn is making it seem that it is europeans fault for the shooting and not the actual shooter . 
  he states that this `` incident '' is caued by `` racist '' remarks by european political parties . 
  yet i bet he will not say a word to the sharia marches in europe where they openly claim they are in war with the west and will destroy european civilization . 
  so you are blaming the victims for the shooting and not the shooter and his personal beliefs which find acts like this as a pathway to heaven and his virgins, 
  best chinese food i 've ever had was a place on greek island with chinese immigrants ( who spoke great greek ) they used local produced ingredients which made it taste much better, 
  these events are going to be exponentially increasing over the next decade , if i was jewish i would be fleeing to israel right now .

  the proposed ** eastern mediterranean pipeline ** which has been in the works with intense back-room discussions the last 2-3 months since ukraine popped off is a proposed pipeline from israel to cyprus and then from cyprus to southern greece . 
  israel and turkey relations are very strained right now , there is no way turkey is getting in on this process . 
  israel wants to work with cyprus and greece because as you said we are `` predictable '' especially cyprus edit : here is the proposed [ emp pipeline ] ( http://www.defencegreece.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/itgi-looks-to-east-med-2.jpg ), 
  the helicopters had ukrainian military markings , rumors on other forums are saying they were firing on ukrainian army soldiers who were going to defect,

  they were some kind of mercenaries , well prepared , fired very professionally . 
  so , ours managed to open fire in return , we have burnt down one of their cars . 
  not like burnt , but hit it good . 
  but they have destroyed more : 3 bmps 2 medical vans ( '' \u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0442\u0430\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0442\u043a\u0438 '' ) .

  the commander answered `` ok , let them stay here '' . 
  they have tried to start engine on bmp , but failed . 
  instead they destroyed it with hand grenades . 
  they have gathered weapons , sat into cars and left . 
  they were payed mercenaries for sure . 
  payed by who - nobody knows .

  well the average greek family has 2-3 children minimum and there is alot of pressure from family to have as many children as possible because everyone wants to be a grandparent , they will guilt-trip you to death if you do not provide asap . 
  most immigrants who illegally enter greece want to get the hell out and only use greece as a stepping stone to their final destination , usually germany/scandinavia and i do not blame them . 
  the biggest challenge places like france/germany have is islamic extremism which greece has no issues with considering that mosques are banned in greece which makes islamic people want to move out even quicker . 
  islamic people usually center their lives around a mosque so greece is like a alien world to them . 
  either way if germany/france enters civil war , greece will get involved . 
  it is not a true war unless greece is involved, 
  i think china is fucked long-term honestly for a bunch of reason , enviornmental , demographic ( men outnumber girls 10:1 in some areas ) , political , economic ( every country crashes , not all can recover ) most of eastern europe/med countries are going to slowly rise over the next few decades while many northern europe countries are going to fall due to demographic crisis 's and economic issues ( largest private debts on earth ),

  it looks at least 50 % aregano . 
  you 'd have to be stupid to buy weed from a gypsy anyway, 
  done, 
  france is going to be in a civil war in 2030-2040 with the demographics issue in some areas . 
  for example marseills is already 40 % islamic adn will be 75 + % by 2030 . 
  and there are already 200 `` no-go '' militant islamic ghettos in marseilles . 
  have fun with that without the eu, 
  uk will form a union with greece , we will give you some more pieces of the acropolis to sweeten the deal, 
  and his hair . 
  just fucking look at his hair !, 
  india ? 
  are you fucking serious now ? 
  even china is debatable . 
  theyve turned their entire country into wasteland just to get into eu/usa economic position , this will destroy them in the long term among other things . 
  eu is the future # 1 superpower . 
  maybe it will be 2050 or 2100 but no other power-bloc has anywhere near the potential as europe . 
  by violating greek air-space this means that jet fighters did so , not commercial airplanes . 
  and yes it is avoidable and each time a jet fighter does cross into greek territory , greek air-force scrambles a few jet fighters to chase them out . 
  alread almost 700 times in 2014 the positive side is that greek jet pilots are now some of the most drilled and well-trained pilots on earth and have become a permanent fixture in usa/israel/greek jet fighter exercises that take place in israel and greece . 
  blue flag 2013 in israel with israel/greece/usa was biggest jet fighter exercise in history . 
  i doubt it , but you just never know . 
  i understand being mad at balkan wars or world war 1 still but independence war is now over 200 years old,

   wifi will be freely accessible at 4,000 public and outdoor spaces around greece , including the public transport network . 
  each hotspot could simultaneously serve 40 to 50 users download speeds upto 1.5 mb/sec for 30 minutes , albeit with restrictions concerning inappropriate material . 
   the first phase of the project will roll out hotspots in 302 of greece 's 325 municipalities who applied for access , and at 100 archaeological sites and museums , as well as at 200 ports and marinas . 
  http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/03/26/free-wi-fi-across-greece-by-year-end/ i think the first phase will be complete by end of 2014, 
  china owns close to 10 % of the debt , yes . 
  but i was not really talking about that . 
  china owns trillions of dollars worth of real-estate , stocks , bonds etc also us debt is nearing 20 trillion $ now and will be impossible to pay off ever in its history . 
  greek debt is around 300 billion and with greece having around 10-20 trillion $ in gas/oil in its waters it will be easily taken down over the next 20-30 years . 
  what will happen if england leaves the eu though ? 
  will these tech companies continue to stay there ? 
  we 'll we have to beat russia to space . 
  we ca n't let them build the 1st orthodox church on mars !, 
  ofcourse with a giant trillion $ gold statue next to it . 
  the original deal was for 400 $ and russia would build all the infrastructure and maintain it for the next few decades at an enormous cost to themselves . 
  china counter-offered with 350 $ at around 4 am after intense negotiations with china building all the pipelines and maintaining it themselves . 
  it was a fair deal for both countries, 
  the fact they china/russia are teaming up for the 2020 + space race is more scary than this gas deal . 
  modern slavery is just as bad as any other time in history , they are just luckier they do n't have to go on a dangerous journey across the ocean and land to reach their final destination . 
  african slavery is hell on earth and the lucky ones get access to mind-numbing narcotics to drown out the pain the misery ofcourse in 1,000 years when europe are in the space-age and incredibly advanced , while africa will still look like 2,000 bc with hundreds of millions of slaves .

  there are still 1,000 platforms to go .
