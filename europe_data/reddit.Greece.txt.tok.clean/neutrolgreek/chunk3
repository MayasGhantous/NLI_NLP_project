  marie le pen is looking the favorite to lead france next elections and she has already stated that her first goal after winning election is to abandon the euro currency and `` regain sovereignty '' . 
  if italy does not improve very very quicly under renzi 's leadership they will turn to far-right parties also like france to abandon the euro currency . 
  lines up with what ive been saying for a while very high percentage will stare/possibly intimidate in the top 3 safest as far as physical/verbal abuse, 
  it is still too early to tell if merkel was a genius or a villain during this crisis . 
  we will know within 10-15 years after everything settles if austerity truly worked or not and put eu onto the right track . 
  send the entire fleet of europe to protect our sea borders create a unified border military of units from every country to protect the land borders of europe create the strictest immigration laws based on japanese immigration laws . 
  if those 3 things do n't happen , there wo n't be a eu future, 
  wtf is wrong with them . 
  they were shooting to kill . 
  i thought they were just shooting at windows/side of building from your title . 
  made of lego 's ? 
  [ video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adzhuatcdre ), 
  it is not like greece will stop spending money on military . 
  greece has met its 2 % required nato spending for the last 40 years , why stop now ? 
  they also kill dozens of innocent females in so called `` honor '' killings every week , very brutal culture in general . 
  this is same people who allowed a nurse who took care of a deceased ebola patient to go on vacation for a week freely without question and did not even attempt to test her until she demanded it . 
  shocked !, 
  ah ok , didnt know that, 
  `` repercussions '' aka , 5 years in a comfy jail , preaching 24/7 about the `` glory '' of jihadism they witnessed in syria , etc. 
  converting and radicalizing hundreds in the jails , which has become an epidemic in uk for over a decade or more now . 
  they are n't `` disillusioned '' , they are just preparing for the next stage of their jihad , to think otherwise is idiocy . 
   lend to greece , you 're nazis , dont lend to greece , you 're nazis nein , kke hardcore commies are ones responsible for thinking this way . 
  they pull insane stunts to get attention , and pretty much call everyone nazi 's in greek government . 
  poland matters because it is the center-piece of america 's european strategy for the next century , as it is located between germany and russia . 
  also polish people are very pro-american so it makes sense . 
  i believe the reason he did this was to hurt ukraine 's chances of recovery the food ban created a massive surplus of european food products which had to be then subsidized and managed by eu to not cause any problems . 
  ukraine 's best chance for short-term improvement in the economy was selling alot of its food products in europe , now with this ban this is impossible as there is already to many competing products that are already subsidized . 
  `` do not panic !, 
  i am only taking a quick flight to argentina for personal business , absolutely nothing related to current events '', 
   the most impressive painting , created in the gold-on-black style of ancient greek pottery decorations , showed a muscular putin lifting his shield against the poisonous breath of the lernaean hydra -- or western sanctions against russia . 
  the us head of the hydra had been lopped off , reflecting the ban on food imports from the us , eu , norway , canada and australia that russia adopted in august , said the exhibit organiser , mikhail antonov . 
  wtf . 
  i have no idea , most likely if its a fake call you will get a warning to not do it again . 
  i very much doubt the euro currency will exist by 2020 , but i still very much hope the eu exists at least, 
  then why is joe biden going there like he did this week and pretending a solution is possible when its not ? 
  just stop attempting to even negotiate and build the pipeline with israel , and like i said earlier this has everything to do with the pipeline since plot 12 is the central location of israel  cyprus pipeline and the cyprus  greece section joe biden is currently the most likely to become next president of usa which makes this even more interesting . 
  my point still stands . 
  greek people like russia because they like russian people . 
  most people who hate russia also dislike russian people, 
  ok , its actually very simple all you need is [ nescafe greek frappe ] ( http://pythagoreancup.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/nescafe-frappe-classic-200gr.jpg ) , milk , sugar and ice-cubes for ingredients . 
  the only other thing you need is the hand-mixer such as [ this one ] ( http://img.auctiva.com/imgdata/1/3/4/8/9/9/7/webimg/435050468_tp.jpg ) , hand-mixer is preferable so you can make the coffee very quickly in the cup you put ingredients in , takes around 60 seconds when you learn to make it . 
  this is actually why it became very popular since in post ww2 greece , greek people wanted a very quick way to make coffee and now its the main coffee drink in the country especially with youths . 
  put in 2-3 spoons of nescafe in cup 2 . 
  put 2-3 spoons of sugar in cup 3 . 
  fill 1/4th of cup with milk 4 . 
  use hand-mixer to mix everything in the cup 5 . 
  add a bit more milk , add around 4-6 ice-cubes and top it off with water 6 . 
  put in straw and enjoy , 
  that makes no sense though . 
  why plot 12 all the way down there ? 
  are they claiming gas for plot 12 ? 
  plot 2/3 could be understandable since its near the north, 
  like russian people is not the same as liking russian government, 
  those russians sure love their catalan independence , huh ? 
  you would think its the most critical event in eu currently , i wonder why that is ... 
   six out of every 10 who dial 1517 are reporting siblings or other relatives for tax evasion . 
  experts tend to see these as acts of revenge rather than genuine attempts to help the ministry of finance identify tax evaders . 
    divorcees wishing to embroil their former partners in a tax scandal also figure prominently among those who dial 1517 . 
  do any finns want to know how to make greek frappe ( iced coffee ) ? 
  do n't think iced coffee is very popular up there but i can give you steps if you want them, 
  lmao !, 
  the pipeline is extremely relevant , joe biden visited 2 days ago to discuss the pipeline with greek leaders as it has become a priority for us geo-political goals in the region, 
  this also likely has to do with the [ greek cyprus/israel pipeline ] ( http://www.cyprusgasnews.com/id/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/the-east-med-pipeline2.jpg ) currently being developed, 
  i dont get it ? 
  they banned the sell of this chocolate ? 
  back then the highest tech available was a propeller plane with a small calliber machine gun glued on top today the highest tech available is a city destroyer that can travel 10,000 miles through the atmosphere and then theres nato . 
  dunno about ethnically , but catalans have their own language, 
  well , there has been a drone program since 1978 which developed the [ pegasus i \\ ( 1986 \\ ) and pegasus ii ( 2003 ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hai_pegasus ) surveillance drones, 
  [ the program has three stated goals  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dassault_neuron ) 1 . 
  to maintain and develop the skills of the ** participating european ** ( should have clarified ) aerospace companies ' design offices , which will not see any other new fighter programs before 2030 now that the rafale , eurofighter and gripen projects are all complete or well underway . 
  to investigate and validate technologies that will be needed by 2015 to design next-generation combat aircraft . 
  to validate an innovative cooperation process by establishing a european industry team responsible for developing next-generation combat aircraft .

  they already did last year , they sold billions to the saudis , most of those weapons are likely already in isis hands,

  [ tap pipeline route ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/trans_adriatic_pipeline.png ) begins construction early 2015 , completion will be around 2020 and is the largest of 3 pipeline currently being built in greece, 
  well i dont post there . 
  theres a script you can use to see where i post . 
  wanting to protect european culture does not make me a nazi or golden dawn hooligan,

  . so much nostalgia comes back every time i hear this, 
  igb pipeline ( greece  bulgaria ) will be ready soon to deliver gas to bulgaria/romania . 
  then those countries will be able to sell the gas to other countries near them for profit . 
  right now the gas is being brought wholesale by greece from algeria until aegean/ionia sea gas drilling is in full-scale production ( already started in ionian sea ) . 
  also tap + emp pipelines will be ready by 2020-2022,

  why are you just making shit up now ? 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2g4l4w/sweden_giving_permanent_residency_to_any_syrian/ckg203m?context=3 , 
  because the eu is the european union , not the world union . 
  when eu was first created i thought the purpose was to create a european brother-hood to protect each other . 
  . all i see is the opposite . 
  also most importantly , a refugee from ukrainian can very easily assimilate into the host nation , especially due to same religion ( orthodox or catholic ) and the fact that all of europe shares a common history so there is no major cultural boundaries to cross that middle-eastern refugees can not seem to over-come . 
  savannajeff thinks it is `` racist '' to discuss race/ethnicity in any fashion , i 've brought up this point up before and he called me racist for assuming it would be a bad thing that swedes would be a minority in their own nation, 
  nobody is against european refugees , i would gladly accept any ukrainian war refugee without a second thought . 
  100,000 this year alone , its in the article note , those are also `` legal '' migrants with proper paper-work .
