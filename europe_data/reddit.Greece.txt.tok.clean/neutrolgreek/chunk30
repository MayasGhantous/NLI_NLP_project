  it is going to cost possibly billions by the end of this, 
  i do n't think its fair comparing farage to wilders and le pen honestly . 
  also , seriously a random picture of black slaves and `` europeans were evil bastards for 500 years '' ? 
  not to mention the vast majority of slave owners/traders in history and modern day have been africans . 
  in fact there are more slaves today in africa then there ever was during colonial times , but that is another debate . 
  people are n't voting farage because they like his `` racism '' . 
  uk voters feel like they would be better served outside the eu ( which it would n't ) but that is their choice to make . 
  that 's a paddlin, 
  also the price is mainly negotiated on how stable your economy is . 
  greece was paying around 450-480 $ since 2008 because of the economy but samaras met with putin 2-3 months ago and took it down to 380-400 $ mainly due to the fact that greece is building up its own gas/oil infrastructure so had much more bargaining power china 's economy is arguable the best on earth when you put in how much cash reserves it has and the fact it basically owns usa . 
  350 $ is a very fair price although i imagine russia was trying really hard to get it to 400 $, 
  `` your kind '' . 
  that is pretty stupid thing to say imo . 
  ** the first writer to use a form of the name was the greek explorer and geographer pytheas in the 4th century bc . 
  pytheas referred to prettanike or brettaniai , a group of islands off the coast of north-western europe ** found this interesting  i like that she wears a corinthian greek helmet , shows how far back greece-england relations go back to, 
  i support samaras right now as prime minister , he is a great mind and actually cares about his legacy . 
  his trips to qatar/russia brought us tens of billions of investment recently and his dealings with azerbaijan to win the trans-adriatic pipeline is one of the best things to happen to greece in recent history . 
  he has made massive reforms lately and even proposing to change constitution to allow more transparency in state contracts for military and gas/oil and also creating great initiatives like free wi-fi for all of greece by end of 2013 . 
  most people who hate him do so because he has n't turned greece into norway in 3 years , but he has a long-term 10-15 year plan which is starting to show results, 
  no , that would be brussels, 
  the iron bank of cyprus - capital : moscow, 
  that looks like the goddess athena , or no ? 
  greece looks largely unaffected , but it is hard to see the details . 
  if global warming comes into full effect , england wold be under water and scotland would become a frozen sheet of ice . 
  likely still liveable with modern technology but not very pleasant .

  90 % + of eu politicians are ex-bankers or soon to be bankers . . high immigration is the dream of every banker for a number of reason . 
  cheap labor and artificial growth being the highest . 
  bankers do n't have countries , they view all people on earth as a single blob of which is used to pump out money . 
  greece is complicated because greek people range from olive skin in the south peloponese/crete and some other islands to pasty white skin tone in athens/macedonia region and a bunch different skin-tones in between . 
  golden dawn will never come close to winning the prime minister role or take any large amount of seats in parliament but i can see them doing well in the athens elections for mayor . 
  the canditate of golden dawn for mayor of athens release this [ 11 point plan of action in 100 days for athens ] ( http://xaameriki.wordpress.com/2014/05/15/candidate-for-mayor-elias-kasidiaris-unveils-11-point-plan-for-athens/ ) athens is where the greek depression has his hardest in greece and it is no surprise to me they are voting for extreme candidates there . 
  gd will never get close to prime minister role as right now samaras and tsipras are fighting it out with around 30 % each and `` to potami '' ( new center-left party ) is getting around 10-15 % and rising . 
  with golden dawn getting around 7-10 % . 
  is it a coincidence that almost every radical feminist i 've ever seen is disgustingly ugly ? 
  europeans are n't really pacifists . 
  we just ran out of wars to fight . 
  we 've spent the last 5,000 years killing the shit out of each other , we finally decided to speak to each other for the last few decades , so no need for wars .

  misspelled brussels *, 
  europe itself is a greek word . 
  i dont even want to spend the time pointing to the thousands of ways greece is the core of the history of europe but i think most people have the common sense and education to know this already . 
  either way , greece is the soul of europe . 
  europe is a greek word in itself and the entire foundation of modern europe was formed in greece and spread out . 
  i think greece is more european than spain/portugal by far , but that is another debate . 
  either way this map is divided by religion , greece could become buddhists tomorrow and it would still be european to the core , 
  i think there is a good chance you are right about eu breaking up eventually , it depends if there is another econimc crisis ( almost certainly to happen since no reforms changed casino-style bankers ) i think a nordic union will happen obviously . 
  also i think a mediterannean union will happen , not a shared currency union but a defense pact union and integrated trade union with the core member being greece , italy , spain , portugal , israel and cyprus . 
  also a germanic union is possible and possibly others . 
  i also hope that these unions form a common parliament to debate together and create close-ties . 
  ithaca is shaping up to be a truly amazing area after this news . 
  [ here is more info on the ithaca transformation ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/04/22/greek-island-of-ithaca-to-become-high-class-resort/ ), 
  is n't the i in pigs for ireland ? 
  i never considered italy in the piglet club, 
  what about albanians ? 
  albanians also have a very unique dna traits , much different than greeks/serbs/bulgarians / etc. 
  albanian people have ancient roots on their land dating from 2,000 years ago,

  yes , and anatolia is yours forever , nobody in greece wants turkish land , and i hate idiots who are always non-greek saying greece needs constantinople back . 
  . but turks and greeks are not even close genetically . 
  you can just google the dozens of in-depth dna studies done by top western universities . 
  turkish people come from lands in the far east of modern turkey and assimlated all the local people on their way to empire . 
  this is how they went form a people of less than 1-2 million people few hundred years ago to 60 + million people today . 
  while for example greeks went from 4-5 million people hundreds of years ago to 10 million today , ottomans were aggressive in assimlating local populations , even kidnapping hundreds of thousands of greeks during occupation to assimlate and train into their army, 
  absolutely not . 
  you can point to dozens of dna studies done by western universities . 
  in dna studies greeks closest genetic relatives in the region are southern italians with a 20-30 % dna match . 
  southern native french with a 10-20 % dna match and spaniards with a 5-10 % dna match . 
  greeks under ottoman occupation lived under sharia law so it was a punishment of death for a turk to assimilate into greek society . 
  . whereas it was ok for a greek to assimilate into turkish society . 
  hundreds of thousands of greeks were kidnapped and/or assimlated into turkey and now are turkish people . 
  you do not erase 10,000 years of genetic legacy from 100-300 years of foreign occupation where the occupiers were seen as barbarian enemies of the christian religion . 
  where the hell did you get 700 years from ? 
  serbia/albania and other northern balkan countries were conquered in 1350 - 1900 so around 500-600 years . 
  constantinople was taken in 1450 , athens/sparta taken in early 1500 's and greek islands taken around 1550-1650 . 
  and we got our freedom in 1800 , so around 100-350 years depending on region . 
  also , turks have alot of greek blood considering it was ottoman policy to kidnap the 4th son of a family to put him into ottoman military and considering that in ottoman times which was under sharia law a turk could not assimilate into greek culture ( punishment of death under sharia ) but many greeks did assimilate into turkish culture ( avoid jizya/persecution ) . 
  many modern turks have great-great-great-great-great grandparents that were greek , which is why some turks have greek features . 
  greeks were a insular and xenophobic society that centered around the orthodox church and living under a strict sharia law where interacting with muslims and vice versa was prohibted . 
  so austria is the house tyrell of europe ? 
  debating * greece is positioning itself to be the gas/oil hub of the eu by 2020 , and news like this will be very common in the coming years . 
  the israel/cyprus to greece pipeline will be the 2nd biggest in greece as the tap ( trans-adriatic pipeline ) will be twice as big and bring gas from the caspian fields of azerbaijan to greece with a pipeline crossing the entirety of macedonia region in greece the 3rd is the smallest , greek-bulgarian pipeline i submitted this yesterday but did n't get any attention - [ greek natural gas business re-starts after 15 years - 3 small gas fields in north-western greek waters start projects with ceremony ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/05/14/greece-signs-hydrocarbon-exploration-deal-eyeing-eur4-4bn/ ) ** each gas field will get a flat 25 % tax ( 5 % dedicated to local region ) and each gas field is a joint venture between one greek gas/oil company and one foreign company ** [ location of gas fields ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8ytwlro.gif ), 
  website not working for me , but i know that 80 % of serbian vacationers go to greece for vacation , they also like to come during winter months which helps during the off-season . 
  serbs and russians also like to party at [ greek clubs/bouzoukia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-hmqax2fc4 ) which most tourists do n't go to . 
  one of the quotes is from 2010 , the other was made after the net neutrality bill was proposed . 
  ** `` let me clear that we will not agree to any proposals that restrict the ability of parents to protect their children from inappropriate content on line , '' he said . 
  ** ** `` we are confident that this was not the intention of the european parliament and we are working with eu member states , the european commission and the european parliament to deliver a final package that promotes an open , safe and secure internet . '' **, 
  i agree , greece deserved the great depression we got and the lessons it taught will be priceless for the coming generations of the next 100 years, 
  no , not really . 
  it was n't great but it was sustainable with a good living standard , everything was really cheap like food/housing etc. 
  what killed the economy was joining the euro and the idiots in pasok ( now dead ) party spending wildly without restrictions in the new euro currency , which created a massive debt bubble . 
  which popped in 2008 after the american mortgage crisis . 
  we can negotiate to put giant breasts on the male figure , this should be enough . 
  barbarians do n't make good hoplites, 
  constantinople was only roman in name , before rome it was a greek city for thousands of years and after rome fell became the center of greek power in the region . 
  istanbul was the greek word for `` the city '' which is what the greeks called constantinople . 
  the city in greek is ** sthn poli ** which the turks thought was the actual name of the city , fun fact of the day !, 
  well , pasok party was viewed in a good light since they did a good job in the 80 's / 90 's . 
  but nobody had any idea of their true intentions until the 2008 mortgage crisis brought the debt crisis in europe .
