  the government lied and cheated the people . 
  it is ironic since greece has the highest government debt/gdp in the west and at the same time the people of greece have the lowest household debt in the western world . 
  you have literally no idea what you are talking about . 
  99.999 % of greeks have no idea of german involvment in bribes . 
  i only posted those links to show the other side . 
  on greek tv main stream news the blame is put on past government figures , usually ruthlessly . 
  if you ask a greek person the anger will be directed at greek politicians , especially from pasok government that brought this mess to greece ( pasok is now a dead party ) . 
  i think you are projecting . 
  either way greece will stabilize as the natural gas/oil boom has just begun in greece , 3 gas fields start this week and 3 major pipelines begin construction this year with 10-20 trillion in gas/oil in greek waters . 
  we will come back from this crisis and then dominate europe ( politically ) as we have for thousands of years . 
  good point , this is why that the current pm samaras [ is proposing constitutional changes to allow for more transparency in government , especially with state contracts \\ ( military/natural resources/etc \\ ) ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/05/07/greek-pm-samaras-proposes-constitutional-changes/ ) i personally think samaras actually does give a shit about the good of the nation , alot of greeks here will disagree with me but he has done alot of things recently that show he is not just some corrupt puppet but actually cares about his legacy . 
  the average greek person is not at fault , they just believed the propaganda from pasok . 
  pasok is the government that promised all these things and were the main people responsible for the debt bubble from spending like crazy on military equipment and creating a massive public sector bubble . 
  pasok went from leading greece for nearly 3 decades to now being considered a `` toxic '' property with recent polls putting them at around 1-2 % . 
  the best thing that came out of this crisis was destroying pasok and their ideology . 
  as far as `` lying '' to get in . 
  i suppose you cant seem to google as you would find that goldman sachs played a central role in this scheme and ecb and eu was well aware of what was going on . 
  germany/france absolutely wanted greece in the eu , so it could sign military contracts and sell mercedes/bmw in euros and not drachma , which they did not want to deal with . 
  each gas field will get a flat 25 % tax ( 5 % dedicated to local region ) and each gas field is a joint venture between one greek gas/oil company and one foreign company [ location of gas fields ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8ytwlro.gif ), 
  i guess this is relevant then : [ ny times - germany , passed out bribes liberally , often through greek representatives , to sell the government weaponry that it could ill afford and that experts say was in many cases overpriced and subpar ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/08/world/europe/so-many-bribes-a-greek-official-cant-recall-all.html?_r=1 ) [ spiegel - complicit in corruption : how german companies bribed their way to greek deals - german companies have taken advantage of the system for years in order to secure lucrative deals .

  [ since the italian republic came into existence in 1946 historians have been warning that , under the right conditions , a dictatorship could regain a foothold . 
  and today italy has its perfect storm : a strong and charismatic leader clashing with the institutions , a rudderless and disconnected political establishment , an economy in tatters , and unresolved popular resentment over perceived loss of sovereignty via the european union and the euro . 
  ] ( http://inside.org.au/italys-best-known-comedian-meets-the-ghost-of-mussolini/ ) ** grillo was tapping into the discontent about italy 's ruling elite that traditional media had largely overlooked . 
  it had been widely assumed that the `` clean hands '' anti-corruption investigations of the 1990s would usher in a new period of good governance in italy ; but what the country got from its `` second republic '' was more of the same , even though many of the leading political figures ( including craxi ) had departed the scene . 
  a 2007 book called la casta ( the caste ) , by two prominent journalists , fed into the general horror over just how corrupt the italian political class had become . 
  ( regional governments were revealed to be particularly good at embezzlement . ), 
  the message to the electorate was that no matter who they voted for , the thieving among public officials would continue . 
  ** ** opinion remains divided , though , over whether grillo is of the far left or the far right . 
  his attitude to corruption may be simple enough : no one with a criminal record should be allowed to hold public office . 
  but when it comes to economic policies he is against what he considers to be italy 's subservience to foreign interests . 
  he believes that the euro -- europe 's common currency -- represents italy 's loss of economic sovereignty , and argues in favour of exiting the currency altogether ( and defaulting on debt ) **, 
  ashina , should n't you be somewhere saying armenian/greek genocide was their own fault ? 
  that seems to be 90 % of your posts . 
  as far as jewish thing . 
  i have no idea where/what this poll is about . . it seems like every poll i read about greece has no basis in the reality around me that i see every day , but that is another debate . 
  i do n't know anyone with a negative view about jews , most people quite like the 1 million jewish tourists that come every year and that number is growing . 
  it is possible they asked a bunch of fascist idiots in athens and asked them . 
  either way , greek/israel relations are getting better every year without new military cooperation/unity and the fact that we are connecting our countries with a pipeline and gas/oil drilling partnerships . 
  5th element had some great ideas about aliens , imo . 
  http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bydlo for those to lazy to google, 
  yes , it is even common on greek islands , few of my 1st cousins were blonde as children and brunette as adults, 
  we just know how to party, 
  greek people are extremely pro-eu believe it or not , everywhere there you will see the eu flag on places and people love the idea of a united europe . 
  but people are still critical of it , especially in athens where the depression has hit hardest . 
  that was amazing, 
  it 's disgusting how little usa has done to help iraqi refugees . 
  bomb them , kill them all , declare victory and leave , the murican way . 
  i do not agree with killing innocents or letting them drown . 
  . but we need to protect every square inch of europes border . 
  i want fucking thousands of modern drones in the air 24/7 . 
  i want thousands of people employed by the eu to monitor these drones for activity and to work with greek/italian/french / spanish coast guards in a central command headquarters . 
  all working together , efficiently to stop this . 
  they will stop coming when they realize it is impossible to do it . 
  this is how it should be done for now imo . 
  not killing innocent refugees on boats but killing the human traffickers and/or leaders of the operation when they are found . 
  here is recent example from greece last month . . greece coast guard chased human trafficker near greek island then killed him http://www.neurope.eu/article/human-trafficker-shot-dead-coast-guards-greek-island all vessels carrying refugees should be stopped , all people interrogated to find who is the leader then kill him . 
  3,000 islands to choose from , each with unique traits, 
  damn trains are flooded, 
  just a coincidence !, 
  i personally hate just sitting on the beach , i need to either be swimming around or playing some kind of game on the sand, 
  that is what the separatist leader stated , the death toll has risen from 6 to 8 on bbc so i expect it to rise much higher as more information comes out . 
  i have no reason to believe the separatist leader or bbc fully yet , more information will be coming out over the next day about this ambush, 
  i 'll have to ask italy first, 
  [ this is from a new ad campaign in the metro , very popular with locals and tourists ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/05/13/clever-ad-campaign-in-athens-metro/ ), 
  ** under kramatorsk , we destroyed 2 btrs , 1 kamaz ( a type of truck ) with infantry , one kamaz with munitions . 
  wounded and killed - around 30 men . 
  only one gaz-66 was able to flee the ambush ( a military truck ) . 
  one volunteer ( separatist ) died - a man from dnepr . 
  ** [ video just before ambush ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8coie22c-e ) [ ukrainian apc explodes during ambush ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccq3yully0i&amp;feature=youtu.be ), 
  is it a requirement to get drunk before speaking in parliament ? 
  i think most extreme homophobes/anti-gay people are secretly gay and just hate themselves for it , thus scream about it all day . 
  that means greece/italy can be the ugly duckling who ends up overcoming personal obstacles in the movie and becomes the most popular girls . 
  . right ? 
  mechanized platoons are useless against guerilla fighters , guerilla/unconventional fighters like these have huge advantage against slow and mechanized units , especially if they have extensive ied/infiltration training ( which they certainly do ) . 
  you need guerilla fighters to beat guerilla fighters , this has been proven in syria recently when hezbollah ( best middle east guerillas ) was what turned the entire war around for assad government, 
  reminds me of the shia vs sunni feud that is killing thousands of people every month in the modern age . 
  let alone the wahhabi sunni vs al-qaeda sunni vs iraqi extremist sunni vs moderate sunni that is killing people every day, 
  everyone loved it except danish people lol, 
  [ the derivatives bubble is going to cause the complete collapse of the world economy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hw9s-z_8yiu ) it is estimated that the derivatives bubble is somewhere between 700 trillion to 1,500 trillion $ . 
  sounds crazy but it is true , watch the link to learn about it . 
  once france/spain fully implode it might bring the full-scale domino effect that could trigger the derivatives to burst . 
  and if it does , world war 2 would look like a nice picnic . 
  i really hope the eu stays together as a military alliance even if the currency fails, 
  [ video of separatists before battle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8coie22c-e#t=70 ) there are mixed reports coming out now , some are saying 50 ukrainian army and dozens of rebels have been killed today, 
  well , we were pretty damn close to complete collapse and going back to drachma . 
  which would have thrown us back to 2,000 bc - it has been a shitty past few years but at least we can see the light at the end of the tunnel now . 
  i am of the unpopular opinion that the 2008-09 greek crash was the best thing to happen to greece in its modern history , it is the only way the government system from top to bottom could have been re-worked and it destroyed the most corrupt political party in greece , pasok . 
  these changes came at a critical point as gas/oil exploitation is about to begin in greece with potential of 5 to 20 trillion $ in profits . 
  . pre 2008 government would have stolen all that money . 
  modern reforms , for example greek government signed a law in january 2014 that 10 % of all future gas/oil profits will go into a science/military research project fund and rest will go into a norweigan style `` social security '' fund ( we hired the same team who created the norway gas/oil fund ) . 
  all these things would have never happened without the crash . 
  sometimes it takes things like that to re-build a poor foundation, 
  we almost went bankrupt for buying all that shit . 
  . may as well brag about it, 
  winter is coming ? 
  solution : move world cup to greece or we will invade luxemborg, 
  ukraine already is economically destroyed , even before maidan . 
  i do not understand how they are the only country of the ex-soviet states to not have risen gdp per capita since they got their independence from soviets .
