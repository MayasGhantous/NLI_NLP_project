  3,000 $ gdp/capita is just . 
  horrible any way you put it , and it is worse when you consider that the gdp/capita was 3,000 $ in 1990 . 
  from what i understand of ukraine the entire economy/political scene is fought between 2 or 3 rival oligarchs who control all the wealth and political power in ukraine . 
  western ukraine produces food while eastern ukraine has alot of factories/mines . 
  if ukraine loses the east , all they will have is some food production and no other industry . 
  the worst thing that has happened to ukraine was losing crimea , there were major western gas/oil corporations ready to go into crimea and set up massive gas operations in black sea with potential of maybe trillions in profit for the ukraine and could have been used to transform ukraine into a modern economy over the next 30-40 years . 
  without crimea . 
  it is just horrible situation for them , and losing the east manufacturing base will be a death blow . 
  just going to point out that greece has the largest military in europe by far , i know germany/uk/france are seen as the `` powerful '' countries but greece has been building its army to an insane level since the cyprus invasion . 
  some highlights , 400 modern fighter jets with some of best pilots on earth [ \\ ( israel/usa main training partners ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdy2y71wqiu ) and ranked with the best in nato exercises ) , 500 leopard 2 a6 , 300 leopard 2a4 and 300-500 older tanks + signed contract in 2013 for 500 m1a1 abrams ( best tank force on earth outside usa/russia ) , modernized and massively equipped navy with dozens of modern submarines , tons of special forces groups rangers/seals/search & rescue , over 100,000 ready paratroopers in a moments notice , 1 million people ready to fight any moments notice . 
  just saying . 
  it would be a bad idea for anyone to fuck with the eu . 
  [ greece is officially sending 4 f16 block 52 + to these german exercises . 
  going to be fun for them ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_02/05/2014_539400 ), 
  they will not be allowed simply because it would destroy the current status quo of power currently in the eu , as turkey would have the largest population in the eu and thus have the most power in the eu parliament . 
  cyprus is our trojan horse, 
  we buy from everyone though . 
  jet fighters/apaches/helis from murica , tanks from germany , assault rifles from usa/israel/germany , armoroud vehicles from usa/germany/russia , atgm 's from usa/russia , etc, 
  how is this cartoon `` conservative '' ? 
  i 'm sure if the main character was a female getting laid and then beating up a bunch of guys and stuff you would be praising it . 
  love the grindhouse visual effects and voice over , this should become its own show, 
  the worst part about the `` bailout '' is the orwellian term of `` bailout '' itself . 
  most people genuinely believe that it is charity , like a friend `` bailing out '' another friend . 
  i doubt these same papers show that the `` bailout '' is actually big business and germany has already posted a nearly 1 billion profit off the bailouts for 2013 with it to exponentially rise every year from now http://www.dw.de/german-bank-bailout-fund-posts-first-ever-full-year-profit/a-16809503,

  you ' r a terrorist, 
  i do n't think you understand how geo-politics work . 
  a group of french mercenaries wo n't accomplish anything in this situation . 
  this is n't fighting some cavemen in the middle of the desert which you are used to fighting . 
  also , sending mercs will make for some excellent anti-western propaganda on russian state television . 
  when they show bodies of russians with french merc 's doing the killing , eastern ukraine will be flooded with russian `` mercs '' western mercenaries in russian territory without air-support would be nothing more than walking corpses, 
  `` dark reputation '' as in massacring innocent civilians for fun . 
  you are even more idiotic than i thought , because the only thing these idiots will accomplish is getting their heads blown off once the eastern ukrainians have decided they will not take that kind of abuse . 
  yes , it does have a charm for being `` poor mans jeep '' , it drives fairly well also and also extremely cheap for parts/repair , i might be interested to buy one when they reveal the updated 2014 model,

  france also sells billions to the saudi psychopaths, 
  he probably took a plane to cyprus , dropped off a few suitcases of cash and went on his way, 
  nice way to calm down tensions , very diplomatic . 
  greece joined the eu the way it did ( rushed/unprepared ) because we wanted a secure military protection union , that is it . 
  and we view germany as the only country capable of providing this in the current eu . 
  if the eu fell apart we would be in a russian union the very next day with dozens of russian bases in greece . 
  it is not due to `` love '' or anything . 
  but simply stability from aggressive acts of other countries towards us . 
  where did i say that ? 
  greece joined the eu for stability on its own will with support of the population . 
  and believe it or not greece people are still extremely pro-eu my point is that greece would leave the union in a second if it was split up like op thinks . 
  it would not make sense to do so and even debating it is idiotic since it has no support anywhere or from anyone . 
  military/economic strength, 
  greece would rather not be in a union , than do something like that . 
  the only reason greece is in the european union is because of germany , otherwise we would align with russia fully and likely join their customs union . 
  also greece has nothing linguistically in common with any of those countries and culturally only superficial things like food and music are similair with countries like serbia . 
  greek people view italians as the only country that is culturally/historically similar, 
  is there such thing as aaaa ? 
  that is actually a bit creepy, 
  why is greece still in it ? 
  their song is absolutely terrible, 
  its likely a bit of both , like that odessa book likely has written material gathered over the last 1 year since euromaidan started and then has an `` odessa section '' with lots of pics and a few pages of written material . 
  this is getting downvoted to the abyss because it is the truth . 
  i called it earlier this year , but assumed it would have taken place around winter time 2014/15 . 
  the 10-12 million russians who live in east ukraine are quickly radicalizing and are forming local militias to fight in their local area . 
  they could n't care less what putin or anyone outside their city says . 
  well the new pony hasnt been unveiled yet , the pictures i linked are from the 1960 's model . 
  i am assuming that the new 2014/15 model will have modern aesthetics but with the same general idea of the original pony . 
  also , it has a charm of being the `` poor mans jeep '' , i would get one myself over a sandero, 
  [ good picture of the pony ] ( http://i112.photobucket.com/albums/n179/niga_photos/various/pony.jpg ), 
  one of the main reasons eastern ukraine russians are fighting is due to having no choice in the governor of your oblast/region . 
  all governors are appointed by the kiev authority . 
  you can see here what kind of idiots they appoint . 
  i did n't say that, 
  they would not be able to get anywhere near germany with the messerschmitt , germany would be able to control all of europe including uk with the jet fighter then set up tens of thousands of jet fighters on western borders to block any attempt by us, 
  i am getting a big roman emperor vibe from putin, 
  he is correct though . 
  the nazi 's planned to exterminate all the slav 's alongside the jews with only a few survivors used as slaves and holocaust camp collaborators and enforcers,

  it 's really hard to say if allies would have still beat germany if russia lost the germans had their own secret weapon , the [ messerschmitt_me_262 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/messerschmitt_me_262 ) - first jet fighter ever made if russia lost early it would have freed up millions of german fighters to the western front and full production of 1,000 messerschmitt 262 per month would have taken place . 
  they only managed to create a few dozen by the time they lost , being assaulted by both fronts caused a rapid end to the war by summer 1945 germany would have been producing 1,000 jet planes a month , which had a 5 to 1 kill advantage over allie fighters and i do n't think they would have been able to stop then . 
  also never forget the greek heroes that made russian victory possible ** `` i am sorry because i am getting old and i shall not live long to thank the greek people , whose resistance decided wwii . 
  '' ** stalin ( from a speech of his broadcast by the moscow radio station on 31 january 1943 after the victory of stalingrad and the capitulation of marshal paulus ), 
  ukraine government calling the russians in east `` terrorists '' and also blaming them for odessa fire is about as toxic propaganda as you can get . 
  i am seeing the rapid radicalization of eastern ukranian russians because of things like this . 
  it is creating a civil war atmosphere and it might very well explode tomorrow during the victory day parades that will be in most ukrainians towns, 
  the propaganda on both sides is toxic right now .
