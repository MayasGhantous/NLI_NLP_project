  . this is the build-up to a civil war and is unstoppable now . 
  it could have been avoided but i personally think the upcoming civil war is what was wanted from the beginning . 
  as you can see from the 2008 wikileaks , the us government was well aware of a potential civil war from signing any eu/nato agreements . 
  no , russia had no problem with yanukovitch signing an eu agreement as long as they also signed a russian agreement , this way ukraine would benefit from both eu and russia . 
  ukraine could have been used as the olive branch between west and russia , a place where both sides meet and make wealthy for the benfit of all . 
  instead eu , under control of us said `` 100 % eu or nothing '' so maidan overthrew the eastern ukraine pro-russian backed government and immediately signed imf/eu agreement using an un-elected government . 
  the 10-12 million russians in east ukraine feel like they are not being represented and even worse oppressed . 
  instead of finding a balance and listening to them , the kiev government called them all terrorists , putin puppets , criminals and sent in the tanks to scare them into submission . 
  you may ask . 
  but ukraine is ukrainian country !, 
  no , it is not that simple . 
  . eastern ukraine has always been intertwined with russians . 
  . you can not just abandon them , call them terrorists and think everything wil be fine . 
  i am not for or against anything in ukraine . 
  i am only trying to show the side that is not being shown . 
  before all hell breaks lose and civil war happens . . which at this point , seems impossible to avoid ( as by design ),

  everyone knows the events that have happened in ukraine were not only planned but orchestrated by usa . 
  [ from the time eu demanded yanukovitch that he had a choice between eu or russia and could not be involved in both ] ( http://youtu.be/ue9julgc42o?t=3m15s ) ( which is cited by that expert as the trigger for this crisis ) .

  [ to american power-player nuland saying `` fuck eu '' and stating who exactly will lead ukraine as their puppet ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5n8ubj8jsk ) germans are not buying this `` russian agression '' narrative considering all these things .

  [ this is a funny germany vs greece skit about ordering food ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=du5zf0um0g0 ) i do n't think it is offensive since its just a comedy skit , and both germans/greeks look weird in the skit . 
  `` messianic '' ? 
  that makes no sense . 
  i say samaras has done a decent job at leading greece and you think i call him the next jesus or something ? 
  samaras changing the consitution to allow more transparency is one of the best things hes done while in power , so i thought i would share it , this does not mean he is jesus . 
  if another person came along who could be a better leader , i would support them . 
  but the dull bastard tsipras has no plans other than being pasok 2.0 and ruining all the progress that has been made . 
  he was also against the changes to constitution to allow more transparency . 
  why do you think that is ? 
  so you think anything samaras does is wrong as usual . 
  more transparency in state contracts and foreign investment = bad tsipras in a monotone voice speaking for 1 hour about nothing with no plans = good, 
  golden dawn does not belong in greece , they are national embarrassment, 
  syriza has no plans , they need crisis to get votes , thus will just prolong current crisis for eternity . 
  nd is turning things around , much to the disappointment of tsipras . 
  well said , a government based on `` strong men '' always eventually to downfall . 
  because they are extremely weak minded samaras is doing a great job , so far in the last month . 
  hes removed immunity from these scumbags in gd and is [ making changes to greek constitution to allow more transparency ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/05/07/greek-pm-samaras-proposes-constitutional-changes/ ) ** samaras also called for three new permanent deputy ministers ' positions ( foreign affairs , defense , finance ) , and a permanent constitutional court , as well as the separation between the positions of elected mp and minister , while also addressing reform of financial governance by proposing a special chamber of the greek council of state be set up to audit major state contracts . 
  all proposals , samaras said . 
  aimed to enhance the functioning of the public sector , while fighting corruption and bringing more transparency to all state activity . 
  ** and he also secured a 10 billion $ investment by uae to re-build the area of the old athens airport which is now un-used .

  debt is tied into anger with our politicians . 
  there is no real guilt per se , more like parents/grandparents whose main hobby is to guilt-trip, 
  reading stuff like this , always reminds me of this article [ a kind of anti-society has grown up in them -- a population that derives the meaning of its life from the hatred it bears for the other , `` official , '' society in france . 
  this alienation , this gulf of mistrust -- greater than any i have encountered anywhere else in the world , including in the black townships of south africa during the apartheid years -- is written on the faces of the young men , most of them permanently unemployed , who hang out in the pocked and potholed open spaces between their logements . 
  when you approach to speak to them , their immobile faces betray not a flicker of recognition of your shared humanity ; they make no gesture to smooth social intercourse .

  the most important thing for both poland and greece in the near future is the `` drone club '' that was founded in october 2013 . 
  germany , france , italy , poland , greece , spain , and netherlands are teaming up to build a next-generation fighter drone by 2020 and keep building new ones from there . 
  it doesnt really matter , cyprus is basically an `` unofficial '' member of nato considering us/uk have a few massive military bases on the greek side of cyprus and would obviously never let them go . 
  how is syriza anything but pasok 2.0 ? 
  because greece could of just done what scandinavia/france did and just accept defeat and not have to fight a war , losing millions of people and destruction of infrastructure . 
  and non-greeks should be thankful because many ww2 experts believe that the greek fight in ww2 is what caused russia to defeat the nazis and win ww2 [ the greek victory over the initial italian offensive of october 1940 was the first major allied land victory of the second world war and helped raise morale in occupied europe . 
  some historians , such as john keegan , argue that it may have influenced the course of the entire war by forcing germany to postpone the invasion of the soviet union in order to assist italy against greece . 
  the delay meant that the german forces invading the soviet union had not attained their objectives for that year before the harsh russian winter , leading to their defeat at the battle of moscow ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greco-italian_war ) ** `` i am sorry because i am getting old and i shall not live long to thank the greek people , whose resistance decided ww ii '' ** joseph stalin ( from a speech of his broadcast by the moscow radio station on 31 january 1943 after the victory of stalingrad and the capitulation of german 6 th army field marshal von paulus ) . 
  not all europeans . 
  the moment i saw that ugly fuck john mccain and the mutant kerry in kiev hyping the maidan crowds to overthrow the government , i knew what was going on . 
  same exact thing happened in egypt/syria/libya . 
  the fact is that 10 + million russians have been living in eastern ukraine since before the country was even created , they have every right to fight back against the kiev government as they do not feel represented or heard . 
  the first thing kiev did was try to pass a bill that banned russian as 2nd language in ukraine . 
  which is insane since russian is the main language in most of ukaine , even places like odessa , it is very rare to hear ukrainian language . 
  then yatsenyuk appointed all his new ministers from western ukraine , 7 liviv/7 kiev and few others from west , zero from east . 
  also some of these appointed ministers were from svoboda with ties to neo-nazis . 
  then yatsenyuk appoints western ukraine oligarchs as governors of eastern regions , which imo was the final tipping point and caused the uprising in the east . 
  when the west started rising up , mccain and his mutant pet kerry cheered it on . 
  when the east started protesting without a beat the fucking tanks were sent in . 
  i feel like people are refusing to understand the position of the russians in east ukraine . 
  it is their country just as much as ukrainians . 
  this has been russian country for over 500 years . 
  and you seriously try to opress them ? 
  you overthrow their president with help from neo-nazis groups and then appoint western oligarchs to govern them ? 
  and you ban their language . 
  and this is russias fault !, 
  eu is being used like a puppet by usa , i am sick of this shit . 
  edit : you ask why would usa do this ? 
  simply part of [ wolfowitz doctrine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wolfowitz_doctrine ), 
  maybe , germany/eu do n't want to `` bend the knee '' to us `` 5 eyes '' . 
  fuck you , we will watch both sides burn to the ground while we rise . 
  who gives a fuck . 
  at least you guys get credit at all . 
  greece lost 1 million people ( 10 % of pop . ), 
  fighting a suicidal battle just to stall the axis enough to help russia/europe and not only do we not get credit , most people have no idea the battle and deaths even happened . 
  there are videos of right sector/pro-unity protestors storming the building and eye witness interviews of survivors who said that rs/pu people were going to each room shooting/beating to death the pro-russians and setting rooms on fire . 
  kiev government has officially just lost all legitimacy imo , and war is coming .
