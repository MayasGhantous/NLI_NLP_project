  those marches with tens of thousands holding nazi flags and torches are just your imagination !, 
  and those guys filming the burn victims and calling them `` ni ** ers '' for their black burned faces are just the democracy loving future eu members, 
  i enjoy the noise also , as long as i get a good nights sleep . 
  otherwise i get annoyed . 
  the islands are the loudest unless you go into the tiny village areas most of the bars/clubs are located under/above residential housing so you will usually see every night at 2/3 am a few grandmas going into the balcony screaming at the drunk people to shut up . 
  and nothing , nothing is worse than those damn gypsy wagons every godamn morning selling cheap plastic chairs or whatever else they have , the gypsy ladies scream like opera singers at like 7/8 am , through every damn street . 
  the weekend mornings in the summer time is like a non-stop alarm clock , which is why many people get sound-proof glass doors on their balconys . 
  why is that ? 
  self-driving trucks/taxi 's would make sense since in my personal experience i have never met more insane , drugged out , psycho drivers than truck/taxi drivers trying to maximize profit . 
  we all know you are a better expert than kazarian , ceo of one of the top investment companies on earth and his team of 100 accountants . 
  your basically morpheus from matrix, 
  funny you say hes japanese , he actually says in the video everyone assumes that lol , it is actually located in california i believe , one of the top investment firms in the country . 
  and i am also confused why the gap is so large between kazarian 's accounting team and brussels , but he really feels passionately about it and hates this `` future values '' accounting trick brussels is using on greece . 
  the thing that confuses me the most is that on the one hand you have the bureaucrats in brussels saying that greece has 160-170 % debt/gdp ratio from using their accounting method . 
  and then you have someone like the ceo of japonica investments ( one of most respected investment firms on earth ) who sent a team of 75-100 accountants to greece last year to perform a rigirous accounting analysis of greece , in his own words `` the strictest form of accounting based on highest standards '' and his team concluded that greece has below 100 % gdp/debt ratio he also blasted brussels accounting method of using a so called `` future values '' accounting trick which he says is the main reason brussels counts greece gdp/debt ratio so high . 
  after his team found that greece gdp/debt was 100 % he invested 4 billion in greek bonds and is buying more every month , to put it into perspective kazarian ( japonica ceo ) has never made a bad investment in their 25 year history as an investment firm . 
  here is the full interview - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eplhpqs2bgk the one thing i am certain of is that i do not trust brussels . 
  the pro-russians were stuck in the building during the fire , over 46 deaths and 200 + injured . 
  many jumped to their deaths to escape being burned , survivors were beaten to death by the angry mob waiting outside . 
  the official ukrainian euromaidan youtube channel calls the people burned in the buildings `` terrorists '' as seen here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycfocxr5mxm another video of burn victims being beaten by ukrainians - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7n6xnc--5eu, 
  im glad some people can see through all the bullshit here, 
  the vast majority of people who contribute here are anti-russian - someone already accused me of this a propaganda post . 
  they do not accept the fact that 10 + million russians have been living in eastern ukraine since before the nation existed and they fell betrayed by the current government for a number of reasons . 
  the logical solution would have been for current government to negotiate with their demands and find middle ground , accepting the fact that millions of pro-russians deserve a say here is a graph representing all of yatsenyuk 's appointment since taking leadership - http://www.foreignaffairs.com/files/images/yatsenyukmap.jpg, 
  i figured this thread will get downvoted instantly, 
  also please notice how i am getting downvoted like crazy , yet nobody wants to debate a single point . 
  there is nothing to debate . 
  only emotions .

  must be a hell of an adrenaline rush for those guys up there, 
  yeh , kinda shitty song, 
  balkans is a made up word from the 19th century . 
  it is insanity to count southern greece/3 ,000 + islands in balkans when most of our history involves the mediterranean sea and basically creating half of europes coastal towns ( southern france/spain/italy ), 
  i do n't even know what that means but you can also say they are the `` quintessential '' med country considering our 3,000 + islands . 
  greek history is one with the greek sea and islands . 
  . but alot of our modern history involves the balkans considering our many wars . 
  i would say stuck between both is more appropriate . 
  thrace was the land of the thracians , a people considered `` barbarians '' by the greeks and consists of parts of a few modern countries north of greece . 
  thrace as a culture were many loosely affiliated tribes across a vast amount of land . 
  here is a map of how the country looked during makedons peak - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:expansionofmacedon.jpg thracians were `` civilized '' by the romans after roman conquest and then assimilated into slavic culture during the formation of the slavic countries in the region, 
  i could n't care less what they call themselves , but they can not enter the eu/nato as their is a dispute considering that 3 million greeks identify as greek-macedonians ( twice as much as population of fyrom ) . 
  also the main issue really is not the name , fyrom 's stance is not `` hey , ancient greek macedonians were bad-ass . 
  i would like to honor them by naming our country macedonia '' it is `` we come from macedonia !, 
  macedonia was not greece !, 
  greeks are fascists for stealing macedonian history ! '', 
  let alone the fact that somehow the great makedons who were 100 % culturally greek and led greece for hundreds of years . 
  all decided to leave greece together and move into enemy territory in thrace ( modern fyrom - which to them was barbarian land ) there is so many other blaring insanity in their nationalism that i am not even angry any more when i hear things like their anti-greek slogans . 
  it makes me feel like i am a participant in the twilight zone, 
  macedonia is not `` maybe '' not macedonia , it simply is not . 
  ancient greek makedon is 100 % inside modern greece and the current territory of fyrom was the location of the enemies of makedon through-out its history . 
  makedon literally translates to `` greek highlander '' after alexanders death the greek-macedonian monarchy ruled greece for nearly 300 years and led all greeks against the romans in four major wars with the 4th war seeing the fall of makedon in 148 bc , and this is the historical date of the fall of free greece to the romans . 
  this event in 148 bc signaled the end of the city-state era the modern people of fyrom appeared around 1,000 years after the fall of makedon to rome and have absolutely no claim to macedonia besides 19th century neo-nationalism . 
  fyrom people will use their main evidence that macedonians were not greeks by cherry picking quotes from athenian statesman , who were their mortal enemies just like athens/sparta were enemies for most of their history . 
  also , its not `` according to the greeks '' . 
  it is according to anyone with a tiny bit of knowledge of ancient history, 
  greece is a med country first and foremost culturally much closer to southern italy/france than any country in balkans although we have a very strong bond with serbia, 
  i thought poland was very pro-eu ? 
  i give this around a 50/50 chance of becoming a reality . 
  in my future worst-cast eu scenario , spain which has made virtually no economic reforms the past few years and with two states wanting to secede heads into a new civil war/collapse scenario ( again worst-case ) uk/spain/italy / france leave the euro/eu if things get any worse . 
  there are already allegedely very serious talks between the french hierachy to leave the euro for example . 
  and most italians would choose to leave the euro tomorrow if they could . 
  greece will stay in the eu since they will gain nothing from leaving as their debt will still be required to be payed in euros and there is a positive economic trend currently happening with reforms + natural gas findings + pipeline deals . 
  germany/poland will also never abandon the eu , no matter what happens so they would have to somehow convince the nordics not to leave them , which will be very very hard . 
  and then you have ukraine . 
  which is a topic of intense emotions within the eu , its very hard to predict what will happen even 1 month from now , let alone 10 years . 
  i ca n't imagine finland and sweden in the same small union correct me if wrong but finland seems like a conservative nation with strict immigration laws while sweden . 
  is the opposite . 
  economically it would make sense though . 
  it 's funny to me because he proposes greece/turkey/caucuses be called `` anatolia '' the greek word for eastern is anatolikos for a reason, 
  we actually agree on something i am 100 % for a banking/energy/military / science union but dissolving all our great european history to create one `` superstate '' ? 
  the only people this would benefit are the ultra-wealthy and it would turn europe into a shittier version of usa, 
  i would be fine with a return of magna grecia if we started doing chariot races and pankration fights to the death, 
  no , they actually do n't exist . 
  these same people call anything from russia propaganda . 
  . yet are seriously saying they believe ukraine government even though there is over 1 hour of video evidence showing who committed the fire . 
  russian hatred is become blind, 
  are you seriously saying that pro-russians burned themselves inside the building ? 
  you realize there are videos of dozens of molotovs being thrown into the building from pro-ukraine side and even people firing guns by windows of people trying to escape i know romanians hate russians with a passion . 
  even more than polish do , but wishing people to be burned alive is horrible . 
  breaking : [ 15 killed in eastern ukraine 's sloviansk ] ( http://en.itar-tass.com/world/730338 ) `` the villagers were said to have come to agreement with the gunmen who were supposed to fire their ammunition into the air and leave . 
  however after several bursts of fire into the air the gunmen turned their weapons against the unarmed people . '', 
  `` right sector did not allow villagers to pick up the wounded and opened fire at anyone who tried to approach them '', 
  things like this make me positive that the cold war 2.0 is in full-swing, 
  im almost 99.99 % positive that picture used in intro is of a german soldier calling for a charge against soviet army during ww2 . 
  it basically means , civil war has started, 
  this is exactly how syrian civil war started . 
  it took one ex-army type guy ( he was basically a nobody ) to call for mobilization and then hell broke loose and still is [ here is the \\ ( in \\ ) famous video of riad assad announcing his defection and formation of battalion , up until this point there was only small riots . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9bakyry7fc ), 
  the only positive from our massive debt bubble is that we have a great air-force/navy/army . 
  i am especially proud of our air-force for being able to compete and excel at us/israel joint-combat exercises which usually happen 3-4 times a year . 
  its not bad , there are actually very decent artists who take part in this competition , especially from the folk-rock area, 
  the greek dance/rap duo have a [ decent music video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgxogtm6lns ) but their live performance is not that great . 
  especially the terrible `` rapper '', 
  this is likely based on truths dating back from 5-10 .000 years ago and stories passed down . 
  a lot of terrifying massive predators used to live on these times . 
  and giant crane like birds are scary , there is a modern species of ultra aggressive crane type bird that enjoys chasing people and trying to gut them with claws . 
  and i 'm almost positive there were birds alive with the wingspan of a bus not long ago, 
  glad you approve . 
  not a surprise since you act like the official dc spokesman on / r/europe in the end , this will not cause the `` pro-russians '' to dis-engage out of fear . 
  this event will cause them to start an insurgency as they have nothing to gain from protesting any more .
