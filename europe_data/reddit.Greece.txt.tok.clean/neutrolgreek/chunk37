  well said , these sanctions will not affect usa at all . 
  no wonder they are the loudest voice calling for them, 
  its sad that in the video their is a guy who is dead/burned and his cell phone is going off non-stop .

  probably under 5 % , but in the event of an actual war they will play a huge role , especially as snipers, 
  the tap pipeline deal which was finalized in 2013 and currently being built will do exactly that the pipeline will bring gas from the vast reserves of azerbaijan through northern greece with a pipeline extending across the entire country and finally to italy . 
  and from italy it will supply europe . 
  https://www.trans-adriatic-pipeline.com/ tap pipeline is the largest of the 3 current pipelines being built in greece and should be complete within 3-4 years . 
  if youve ever seen videos from syria it is pretty hilarious how non-stop that is used . 
  to the point where half the radio-talk on walkie-talkies is saying that * radio in * allahu akbarx5 * response * allahu akbarx5, 
  soviet union was to communism what democratic peoples republic of korea ( north korea ) is to democracy, 
  that is bs , greek females would play a large role in the event of a large scale war . 
  [ greek female apache pilots ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deu7yh6jams ) and they make great tank operators - drivers/gunners etc also , they make great snipers , in fact one of the best soviet sniper was a female with 309 confirmed kills, 
  great news, 
  you realize that germany made 5 billion $ a year from this military spending , correct ?

  we got these great `` bail-outs '' . 
  which of course are absolute charity from the great german people .

  yes , but were not banning twitter and youtube, 
  yes, 
  if basque leaves that means catalan will also leave . 
  combined they are around 20-25 % of total gdp . 
  and spain will enter dark times if they secede , imo . 
  i can not predict the future though, 
  you expect everyone to help in c.a.r ? 
  poland is heavily involved because this current situation is happening on their borders and they need to be prepared . 
  greece has historically been pro-russia so we are staying neutral and will likely play a role in mediating and negotiations between eu and russia to calm tensions down in future . 
  the future of the eu military is the so called `` drone club '' which will have a next-gen fighter drone complete by 2020 - counties involved are france , germany , greece , italy , the netherlands , poland and spain . 
  http://euobserver.com/defence/122167 and to finish , greece is the only country in europe prepared for a world war . 
  since cyprus invasion greece has invested nearly 10-15 % of gdp per year in military , while most countries do not even meet the required 2 % a year nato requires . 
  greece is staying neutral , not sure about germany, 
  i doubt it will happen until late 2014/early 2015 - but it is already looking pretty good as greece is far ahead in posting a surplus for 2014 . 
  in first 3 months of 2014 greece posted a 2 billion euro surplus , compared to first 3 months of 2013 which posted a 3 billion deficit . 
  the entire eu is being used like a tool in usa foreign policy . 
  all the sanctions being used against russia are only going to harm russian elite and eu citizens . 
  the entire ukraine/russian conflict begun because of eu being used like a tool to force putin 's hand , this happened when eu ( controlled by usa ) declared that ukraine had to make a choice between russia or eu and could not be involved with both . 
  fully knowing that was impossible and would create a conflict . 
  i am not for or against independence since i do not know the situation clearly . 
  but one thing i am positive is that if cataln/basque leave , spain will have a complete economic collapse and will likely have to leave the euro . 
  do people not realize that ? 
  if basque/catalan leaves , i read somewhere that their football teams will enter the french league . 
  is this true ? 
  my prediction has been for the last few months that ukraine will reach critical mass around november-february freezing months . 
  with gas prices set to rise 4-8x higher and full-on economic collapse to happen around this time also , i think a full-out proxy war between russia and west will happen . 
  boycott subway , make better and healthier sandwiches at home and save some money, 
  this is getting heavily downvoted imo , subway should be boycott 'd . 
  they can go fuck themselves . 
  also , muslims are 5 % of the uk population . 
  wait until they are 20-30 % within 20 years , and then 50 % by 2050-2075 . 
  people spending 90 % of waking hours a day on internet is common today, 
  half the day does seem pretty normal to me , unless you count iphone usage also , which 60-75 % is normal to me . 
  these maniacs set up a trap in their garage with an open purse . 
  stayed up 3 nights ( probably on meth ) to catch someone taking the purse and kill them . 
  the poor kid was likely trying to return the purse to the homeowners . 
  greece received around 20 billion $ in cohesion funds between 2007-2014 - http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docgener/informat/country2009/el_en.pdf alot of good things were done like linking up the big islands with good infrastructure and many other things . 
  i prefer a great europe scenario . 
  . otherwise this whole eu thing is a waste of time and resources . 
  it would be the end of the eu, 
  i had no idea poland even had a 300 billion $ package , i am assuming this is a loan like a bailout package correct ? 
  i see , i thought it was how much of the day you use it . 
  where i live , the village next to us where one of my aunts is from has a really odd way of speaking greek . 
  they basically talk super fast like chipmunks , hard to understand anything and they also have some unique words . 
  im not sure if it counts as a dialect but its pretty funny to me and my family . 
  if this position is in charge of preventing corruption during miltary sales between eu states i support it 100 %, 
  91 % of the day is a bit much, 
  right . 
  . anyone who has a different opinion than what bbc/cnn are saying is getting payed to say it . 
  must be nice being so ignorant , since ignorance is bliss . 
  what is worse-case scenario to eu if uk does leave, 
  ukraine is more complex than `` evil '' russians the country is strongly divided between east and west , and has been for decades . 
  when yanukovitch led , all the ministers/parliament was filled with only eastern ukraine politicians and now that yatsenyuk leads all the ministers are western ukranian . 
  putin is not going to invade poland or finland , he has no interest . 
  everything that has happened so far and will happen has been calculated by western powers . 
  in greece the prison situation is not good right now . 
  the total budget pre-crisis was around 2-3 billion $ per year , after austerity cuts , the total budget is around 150-200 million $ . 
  he also wanted to go to war with syria and be the official air-force of al-qaeda . 
  the only thing that stopped him was a viral campaign by high-ranking air-force pilots posting pictures on instagram of them saying they did n't want to be the air-force for aq . 
  why is putin/russia already being treated like the enemy ? 
  this whole mind-set of `` mingling '' with the enemy as this suggests is not right imo . 
  this is just politics , even if it takes place at a party . 
  with things like banking union , energy union , military union ( [ `` drone club ] ( http://euobserver.com/defence/122167 ) '' ) it is slowly coming together . 
  [ even things like a scientific union is taking place , for example the cern lab in switzerland is connecting a `` ultra-fast '' data line to greece for data-crunching and training . 
  ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/04/14/kavala-greece-to-host-cern-computer-summer-school/ ), 
  the natural gas from greece is not meant for the scandanavia market , norway has a complete lock of that entire area . 
  the natural gas from greece/going through greece is meant mainly for italy/spain/portugal / france/poland/eastern europe/etc also yu have no idea of the true size of greece 's nature . 
  i also do n't and i have seen dozens of nature documentaries of greece , it is not just beaches and `` dusty '' hilltops . 
  i knew greece would be a clusterfuck the moment the euro became available , it just didnt make sense to me at the time to do it . 
  also , greek people are world renown for their hospitality and caring for foreign tourists , this is one of the main reasons why tourism keeps growing every year . 
  greece depends on tourism more than most countries so we treat our tourists like royalty .
