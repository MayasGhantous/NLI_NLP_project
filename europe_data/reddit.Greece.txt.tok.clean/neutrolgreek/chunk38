  the one thing for certain is that things can only get better , greece has went through a great depression the last few years , just because they do not call it a great depression doesnt mean it is not . 
  i think it is insane to say that natural gas will be `` obsolete '' in 20 years . 
  maybe in 200 years , not 20 years, 
  there is a reason why 20 million people a year ( growing 10 % a year ) come to greece every year , double the actual native population . 
  and it is not because of `` generic '' beaches . 
  greece is not just beaches , the entire mainland is filled with incredible forests and mountain villages i can not predict the future , but the only thing i know is that i am very positive of our position around 2030 +, 
  the greek diaspora contributed greatly to modern way of life considering there are 10 million greeks in greece and around 8-10 million greeks outside greece . 
  the renaissance was influenced greatly if not the most by greeks and this intellectual revolution sparked the modern age . 
  like you said though `` fuck the past '' , greece is already one of the european leaders of nano-tech with their new state of the art facility/university soley for nano-tech and this september they are connecting another university in greece to cern in switzerland for `` data crunching '' . 
  also by 2020-2025 potential billion of dollars per year will be available for `` research '' by natural gas funds , as 10 % of all gas profits was signed into law to fund research , finally greece and 6 other countries in eu started a `` drone club '' which is a major future high-tech field . 
  you `` uber '' humans were canibal tree-men shitting in the woods . 
  when we built the parthenon , all i have to say . 
  history repeats itself my friend and the current `` union '' is very very temporary , 
  i did n't lie , my corrupt government who were puppets to german bankers lied . 
  the whole `` lie '' was orchestrated by goldman sachs , you can google this if you do not believe me . 
  and the euro is dead . 
  france is on its last breaths and the elite are already in talks to get rid of the euro . 
  you want to know what happens then ? 
  take a wild guess . 
  i have never met more ignorant and brainwashed individuals in my life than scandanavians . 
  . yet they all rank high ? 
  you realize that in places like sweden , you can not criticize immigration correct ? 
  you consider this still a `` free media '' place ? 
  the hypocrisy and bullshit from you people is never-ending, 
  i doubt we will pay most of the money in actual cash , there will likely be a deal made very soon to trade natural gas for debt . 
  also you have already made a profit from the `` bail-outs '' . 
  i only hope we get a taste of that racket once we get out of this debt bubble . 
  greece could have its economy go 50 % worse by tomorrow morning and it would still be a more pleasant and wonderful place then 99 % of places on earth . 
  you realize that greece is a land of endless beaches , un-touched nature and un-polluted land correct ? 
  athens is a bit of a shit-hole in some areas but it is the only place like that in greece . 
  and you are delusional to think europe will get 100 % of energy from renewables . 
  populations are growing at such a rapid pace that even with exponentially growing renewable energy units , you will still need more gas than today . 
  you have no idea about the reality of europe outside of your propaganda . 
  notice `` manufactured '' you dunce , learn some fucking history . 
  if germany did not destroy our country we wouldnt have lost over 30 % of our population in less than 10 years . 
  the installation of a foreign-backed dictator and supression for over 30 years . 
  germans have been fucking over greece since 1800 , you have no idea what you fucks have done , but we know and will not forget . 
  90 % of those people killed were innocent civilians you fucking idiot . 
  germans would just massacre entire families at any time we should of just done what scandanavia did . 
  bend over and spread our ass-cheeks . 
  they got long-lasting peace in return after ww2 where they built all their current `` mega-corporations '' . 
  what greece got in return was a manufactured civil war and the murder of 1 million more greeks after ww2 . 
  we will never forget this . 
  greek tv is not some 1984 shit , idiot . 
  the most popular comic show on tv is basically 1 hour of a stand-up comedian blasting past/present elite/government figures in the most destructive way possible . 
  i suppose he counts as our `` john stewart '' . 
  the newspapers/mainstream news is certainly not as `` indepedent '' . 
  not in `` congo '' levels ( seriously ? ), 
  it is not even close to fox news level propaganda also . 
  i would say it is a standard news sources , most times showing both sides ( for example ukraine both west and russia view ) but does not `` blast '' current government figures as they should . 
  i 100 % blame our politicians for being fools and falling for the traps they did , very weak politicians . 
  1 million people , 10 % of population was murdered . 
  countless atrocities and massacres, 
  `` press freedom '' means very little when the entire population uses the internet to get their information . 
  time will tell my friend  it is easy to act like you own the world when you are on top for the moment , greece was like that for nearly 3,000 years , and we could never imagine not being the most important place , but things change . 
  as will the current alliances and unions change , and when greece rises again with the new natural gas exploitation/pipelines , alot will be changing . 
  while scandanavians bent over and spread their cheeks wide open for the nazi 's , greece fought back , lost 10-15 % of our population and the ruin of our country . 
  what did scandanavia get in return ? 
  long lasting peace where in post-war period nearly every single of their modern corporations such as ikea/car makers/tech makers/etc were built what greece got in return was a manufactured civil war and the death of 1 million more ( 10-15 % ) deaths of our population . 
  greece has been betrayed countless times by our `` allies '' . 
  and now the only countries greece trusts are russia and serbia, 
  once france pops . 
  and it will , the entire house of cards will come crashing down . 
  like i said , they would `` disrupt '' the current german - ** dominated ** eu , not completely replace it . 
  i honestly would not mind them in the eu , since greece could stop spending 50 trillion $ a year on military gear , but i just do not see it happening . 
  if turkey joins the eu , they would automatically be one of the most powerful member of the eu , usurping the current german-dominated eu we currently have . 
  after at least a hundred posts read over the last day about how bail-outs are purely charity with absolutely no potential of ever making a profit , i would like to set things clear . 
  bail-outs are big business , i only hope when greece does get out of the current mess , we get involved in this game also . 
  and you admitted to being anti-greek , so fuck you my friend . 
  half your posts over the last 3 days have been anti-greek , even claiming that greece has no claim to ancient macedonia . 
  . but ofcourse the slavic macedonians do ( since they appeared 1,000 years after alexanders death ) . 
  you are a fool to believe this is a `` conspiracy '' i do think ( hopefully ) eventually the germans involved in all these scandals will be brought to justice , but i highly doubt any time soon . 
  in the end , what angers me is not that germans bribed greeks to purchase billions of german military garbage . 
  but the fact that germans will still blame greeks for it , like you just did right now . 
  ofcourse . 
  it is greeks fault for taking the bribes ( it is ) . 
  but never ever the germans fault . 
  there is no corruption there ( right ? ), 
  [ german bank bailout fund posts first ever full-year profit ] ( http://www.dw.de/german-bank-bailout-fund-posts-first-ever-full-year-profit/a-16809503 ) it is time the truth is for once heard instead of repeating the propaganda `` talking-points '' every idiot on this forum spouts every day i only wish after greece gets out of this mess , that we get involved in this `` bailout '' business . 
  lots of money to be made . 
  we will never know the names of the germans . 
  germans control the eu and are above the law in every way . 
  this whole process has made the military spending more transparent though , so no more sweet deals for your corrupt industry, 
  germany makes around 5-10 billion $ a year ( 30 years ) from greece selling us their shit , which contributed larger to greece 's financial crisis much more than any other factor . 
  i hear propaganda against the common greek at such an astounding amount . 
  when in fact it was the greek government 's insane spending of miliary equipment that brought us here . 
  who do i blame ? 
  100 % the pasok leadership for taking the bait of these ludicrous deals , but we ( greece ) absolutely deserved what we got , with this depression . 
  our politicians failed us , for not understanding how they were being played like fools , and the only thing i can hope for , is to live and learn from this multi-generational economic depression .

  mr. kantas 's testimony , if accurate , illustrates how arms makers from germany , passed out bribes liberally , often through greek representatives , to sell the government weaponry that it could ill afford and that experts say was in many cases overpriced and subpar .
