  mr. kantas 's testimony , if accurate , illustrates how arms makers from germany , passed out bribes liberally , often through greek representatives , to sell the government weaponry that it could ill afford and that experts say was in many cases overpriced and subpar .

  . when the time comes , maybe 20-50-100 years from now, 
  which is surprising since you have no idea of the greek role in ww2 or the atrocities you committed there . 
  fuck gd , bunch of brainless thugs . 
  i want intellegent , savy and cunning politicians playing this political `` game '' . 
  not a bunch of black-shirted thugs . 
  the only way to beat you , is to be better at this politics game . 
  and gd will never be capable of doing this . 
  you seriously do n't think russia has incredible knowledge of all americas arsenal and built sufficient counter-measures ? 
  you greatly greatly mis-understand the russian mentality to warfare . 
  the biggest factor to greek crisis was spending 300 billion since cyprus invasion . 
  where do you think the debt came from ? 
  ofcourse , countless corrupt german officials were caught bribing corrupt greek military officials into buying billions of german equipment every year . 
  you learn from the past . 
  and this whole series of events going back to cyprus will not be forgotten . 
  greek politicians in the past were unable to play the political `` game '' , and we got fucked over hard . 
  the iraqi army is absolutely sunni in sunni dominated areas . 
  i bet your one of those idiots who thinks there are no sunnis in the saa or syrian sunnis who support assad, 
  the future of warfare will not be a world war . 
  . it will entirely be civil wars between ethnic/religious divisions with each side having either `` west '' or `` russia '' fund them as a proxy . 
  by 2050-2100 i will say there will at least be 3-4 civil wars happening within the eu due to this , and this will be the biggest challenge facing the eu into the future . 
  assad will win this war and iran will dominate the future of the middle east , get used to it . 
  when people think russia can be easily defeated by nato . 
  they do n't understand that russia has an advantage with these missiles . 
  it does not matter how advanced your jet fighter aircraft is or drones are , against these things . 
  you seriously think the leaders of eu had no idea of greece 's finances ? 
  [ spiegel : how goldman sachs helped greece to mask its true debt ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/greek-debt-crisis-how-goldman-sachs-helped-greece-to-mask-its-true-debt-a-676634.html ) also , the threat of greece leaving the eu and shaking the stability is long-gone . 
  yes . 
  major wars has a habit of bankrupting a nation . 
  greece has been involved in nearly a dozen wars in the last 150 years, 
  as long as greece maximizes profit on every ounce of natural gas from greece or going through greece in the current 3 pipelines being built , i have no issue . 
  the current bail-out program was aggreed to years ago and the money comes out in small chunks every few months . 
  samaras has already guaranteed that no matter what happens , there will never again be another bail-out program after the final amount is released . 
  also , the people `` occupying '' or protesting/etc are doing so because there have been mass lay-offs which was demanded by the troika . 
  they are currently repairing them , greek government just got the project up and running last week and will make all 4 subs sea-worthy soon . 
  the reason they call them `` bail-outs '' is straight from orwell . 
  it gives the un-thinking majority of people who exist the idea of `` bailing out '' a friend . 
  i mean who has n't ever bailed out a friend before ? 
  when in fact these `` bail-outs '' are predatory loans with usury level of interest rates . 
  the term `` bail-out '' imply 's charity . 
  as those who picked the name intended it to be . 
  what the fuck are you even talking about ? 
  there is a reason why the pasok government that brought greece into that amount of debt went from ruling greece for decades to getting 1-3 % voting in polls in 2014 . 
  i personally think samaras is a great mind and has done a great job of turning things around . 
  [ an investor from california buying 4 billion $ worth of greek bonds recently would have seemed crazy in 2010 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eplhpqs2bgk ) there are countless other examples of the turn-around , including the construction of 3 major gas pipelines being built now through greece and other gas-related news . 
  i personally think that what greece went through 2009-2013 ( great depression bigger than 1920 's ) could not be solved in 1-2 years . 
  i think 2020 we will see a fully recovered greece . 
  look , most greeks arent hardcore religious but we are 100 % loyal to our religion due to tradition . 
  this is why greeks 99 % of the time only marry other greek orthodox christians , it is simply ingrained in our mentality . 
  the ultra-athiest societies of the north value no traditions or culture . 
  and they will be invaded by more aggressive cultures , since that is how humanity works . 
  you can not over-ride natural human instinct . 
  also saying `` sitting on asses not paying tax '' . 
  shows how fucking brainwashed and idiotic you are . 
  on one hand you fucking blame the `` oligarchy '' and then in next sentence you blame the common greek villager who works his ass off every day to put food on the table ? 
  you should be ashamed of yourself , i was paying attention until that part , because you do n't even understand how the `` oligarchy '' made you believe such fables as that . 
  where you blame the common greek ( who has lowest debt in western world ) . 
  and not the greek government ( which fucked greece with government debt ) enjoy your `` utopia '' . 
  . while it lasts . 
  islamic front is 90 % saudis , do n't bullshit . 
  the only fighters worth any salt in syria are foreigners , you can not deny this considering recent events . 
  in the recent kassab offense which was coordinated by turkish intellegence , 5,000 foreigners mainly turk/saudis/morrocans / etc stormed the turk/syria border town of kassab and launched a surprise offensive against lattakia . 
  in the east of syria it is 100 % nusra/isis dominated and they are fighting each other daily . 
  in the south at jordan/syrian border the islamic front rules which are majority saudis . 
  this is the only area where there are actual syrian battalions , they now call themselves srf ( syrian revlutionary front ) since fsa are widely considered thieves and thugs . 
  in aleppo , a big offensive by chechens took place last week which caught saa off guard . 
  the only capable fighting forces are foreigners . 
  the syrians are only used as `` holding '' militias . 
  in the same fashion that ndf are used to hold territory after saa rush through . 
  simply because there was not any opportunities in the past . 
  while northern europe was building things like ikea , volkswagen , audi , etc in the 50-80 's . 
  greece was under the thumb of a foreign installed dictator which fucked over 2 generations of greeks . 
  things are radically turning around , considering things like the new nano-lab/university in thessaloniki . 
  the upcoming connection between greece cern center to swiss center this september with classes for young people to learn/research . 
  and most importantly there was a law signed a few months ago that made 10 % of all natural gas exploitation money go directly into scientific research . 
  potentialy of hundreds of billions considering there is an estimated 5-20 trillion $ of gas in greek waters . 
  greece is currently building 3 major gas pipelines to export gas from asia/israel and soon greece to rest of europe . 
  we also hired the norweigan team who created the social security fund valued at 1 trillion $ from natural gas to make a similair security fund with greece . 
  i consider organic food a massive future industry for greece , and it is exponentially growing every year . 
  there was a ted conference , i cant seem to find now that explained this . 
  greece always . 
  . always wins in the end . 
  this has been proven for over 5,000 years . 
  your anti-greek bias is showing . 
  at least hide it a bit better . 
  ah yes . 
  the modern `` liberal '' idiot . 
  borders/nations are `` stupid '' and fake . 
  you will never understand the greek mentality my friend . 
  while your `` paradise '' of scandanavia lives their `` utopia '' multi-cultural dream and is now the rape capital of the world because of it . 
  that is only the beginning . 
  greece will be the last man standing in europe because we do not accept other cultures as equals . 
  we do not want immigrants or other scum in our country and this is why while the rest of europe burns to the ground from mass immigration , greece will rise again  yes , you will certainly think im insane for saying such a thing . 
  beause it goes against your educational `` programming '' . 
  but i hope you live a long life and understand what i am saying today . 
  borders and ethnicity/cultural heritage/xenophobia is a natural human instinct and idiots like you who say these things are `` fake '' will be responsible for what is coming . 
  it 's pretty funny how little value you put on greece 's role in ww2 . 
  while the actual people who fought in ww2 say differently .
