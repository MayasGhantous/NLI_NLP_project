  tax evasion accounted for around 20-25 % of total `` bad debt '' when the crisis happened . 
  the biggest factor in the debt mountain that greece got itself into is reckless spending on military equipment , which some estimates put in the 400-600 billion $ range over the last 30 years ( since cyprus invasion ), 
  it was a german company during the 20 year duration while it used `` creative accounting '' to avoid paying the vat , so it is relevant,

  greece has been above 2 % for around 30 years now it was closer to 5-10 % up until the crisis and is now 2.2 % i believe . 
  greece has `` officially '' spent 300 billion on military since cyprus invasion happened , it is also known that greece has a `` secret '' military fund that is estimated to be 200-300 billion on top of the official spending . 
  so around 500-600 billion total since cyprus . 
  i do n't think much wealthier countries in europe have even spent 20 billion the last 30 years, 
  only german military industry is capable of that,

  the difference between poland and greece is that poland had no fear of foreign invasion/agression from russia since russia was incredibly weak post-soviet union . 
  greece spent 300-400 billion in military spending since cyprus invasion due to fear of foreign agression . 
  . most countries in europe have barely spent 10-20 billion the last 20-30 years meanwhile greece spent 300-400 billion . 
  also i agree that the 90 's / 2000 's greek government did screw up economic development , pasok socialist 's were completely incompetent and anti-capitalist . 
  as of 2014 , it is a different mind-set and government is ultra-capitalist and understands the `` game '' which is how greece aquired over 100 billion $ in foreign investment contracts in just the last 6 months alone . 
  which is probably more foreign investment that greece has had in the last 10-15 years combined . 
  have you talked to your local sharia police about being up this late posting on the internet ? 
  the civil war was the first proxy war of the cold war era . 
  poland being under soviet boot meant there could not be two sides . 
  yugoslav 's + ussr supported a pro-communist greek group with lots of money/man-power and tried to take over greece usa/uk supported a pro-west side also please stop talking about this marshall plan bullshit , greece received 10x less than uk/france from marshall plan and even less than turkey , who did not even fight in ww2 !, 
  the marshall plan was used to buy bullets for greeks killing each other , not to rebuild . 
  greece did not even have a democratic government until the 1980 's . 
  and was incredibly poor , easily as poor as poland during the same time period . 
  poland just had its best economic decade in history and is still below greece . 
  greece just had its worst economic decade and is still above poland . 
  300 bilion that poland received was not just an `` investment '' . 
  . greece received 20-30 billion over the last 20 years for its eu devlopment program and has one of the highest `` abosption rates '' of eu funds in europe ( meaning money was used wisely on infrastructure ) 300 billion is a bailout , there is no question about it . 
  either way , like i told other polish reply . 
  both countries have a positive outlook in future . 
  both poland and greece have bright prospects , greece being future energy/shipping hub of eu and poland being the most important geo-political strategic location for usa/eu . 
  you do not know much of greek recent history , a polish person also showed me this pic yesterday and gave me this `` excuse '' greece actually fought in ww2 ( unlike polish ) and had the longest resistance in ww2 with 220 days , second longest was norway with 66 days , first of all . 
  ( greece received less form the marshall plan than turkey who were not even involved in ww2 ) after ww2 , greece entered a civil war between commies and pro-west greeks [ `` the civil war left greece in ruins , and in even greater economic distress than it had been following the end of german occupation '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_civil_war#post-war_division_and_reconciliation ) then a 30 year dictatorship followed . 
  greece did not even begin re-building until the late 1980 's . 
  similair to poland , no ? 
  also poland just received a bigger bailout than the total bailout to greece , ireland , portugal and spain . 
  combined http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-29/polish-300-billion-aid-package-hides-eu-expansion-flaws.html educate yourself before looking like a fool,

  stfu, 
  the government of 90 's was incredibly stupid for joining the euro currency when it still needed 10-20 years of preparation so i agree which is why the pasok political party of 80-early 2000 's does not even exist anymore ( 3-4 % in recent polls ) either way , greece has a very positive economic future within 5-10 years with recent gas/shipping/tourism deals made . 
  ukraine has what ? 
  soil ? 
   ukraine has a much better history of economic sensibilities whatever this is supposed to mean , it 's wrong . 
  ukraine corruption makes 90 's / early 2000 's greece look like amateurs and the economy over there has been in complete disarray since the fall of soviet union . 
  then how is greek gdp/capita 23,000 $ and ukraine is the only country post soviet-union to not have risen in gdp/capita since 1990 with it stagnating at 3,000 $ gdp/capita for over 20 years ? 
  can you seriously tell me with a straight face that ukraine has `` great economic history '' when it is the only post-soviet country to not have risen in gdp/capita like poland did , staying at 3-4 ,000 $ gdp/capita range the entire time ? 
  the downfall of greek economy was military spending due to external threat and accepting euro currency unprepared . 
  if it was not for those tow things it would be very sustainable, 
  1,500 raped in one town , sort yourselfs out `` mate '', 
   i 'm not going to talk about grece here , but ukrainians consider themselves as hardworking , honest people you just made an assumption that greeks arent even though they work the longest hours in the eu . 
  greek gdp/capita - 23,000 + $ ukraine gdp/capita - 3,000 $ `` hardworking '' ukraine corruption is on a completely different level than greece , do n't give me this bullshit, 
  you realize that greek gdp/capita is 23,000 $ + and ukraine gdp/capita is 3-4 ,000 $ + correct ?
