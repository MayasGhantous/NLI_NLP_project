  i think the 3 million greeks who identify as greek macedonian will have an issue with this . 
  but i suppose they do n't matter ? 
  not sure what your point is ? 
  the area of republic of macedonia was 100 % [ thracian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thracians ) land during the time of the greek-makedon kingdom the greek macedonian people ceased to exist in 148 bc after roman conquest . 
  the greek macedonians along with athenians/spartans/thebians / etc assimilated into a common greek identity . 
  the people of republic of macedonia did not appear until 1,000 years after the fall of makedon to the romans . 
  these are not `` opinions '' also the area of ancient macedonia , has always been and still is called macedonia . 
  why do you think this is such a major issue ? 
  3 million greeks identify as greek macedonian . 
  tap pipeline is largest with 20 billion cubic meters per year capacity [ eastern mediterranean pipeline has 10 billion cubic meters per year capacity ] ( http://www.naturalgaseurope.com/cyprus-greece-dilemmas-energy-infrastructure-rcem ) [ interconnector greece - bulgaria has a 5 billion cubic meters per year capacity ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gas_interconnector_greece-bulgaria ),

  '' * [ here is the prime minister of fyrom at a ceremony with a map of northern greece as part of fyrom ] ( http://i.imgur.com/omdvllt.jpg ), 
  it is not petty at all if you understand the situation more than just a `` naming '' issue . 
  it is not just a naming issue . 
  it goes far deeper than that . 
  when you have fyrom ` ians who learn at school about the `` evil '' greeks stealing their glorious ( false ) history and the radicalization that can follow such beliefs . 
  than maybe you will somewhat understand the current situation, 
  greece + italy will form a union and germany can form its own union we can meet up at poland for our annual wars also, 
  this pretty much proves that their is a polar arms race happening , as putin made a statement last week that he will dramatically increase military spending on troops/personal located at the poles . 
  i do n't think ive heard people debate whether slavs are white or not . 
  which is stupid since they are , but only if they are truly `` european '' or not , since alot of people have vastly different versions of what european countries are . 
  many do n't consider slavs european , but i do . 
  except for the twilight zone known as fyrom . 
  they could have at least went with a fake history that wasnt so ridiculous . 
  italian since we can communicate purely with hand gestures least favorite : french, 
  i didnt say they were the top 5 , only my top 5 , which is likely why i am getting downvoted . 
  i guess opinions are frowned upon here, 
  themistocles/leonidas - stopping the persian horde from destroying greece/europe , which led to the rise of the 1st democracy and base for what it means to be european . 
  pericles - the leader-statesman of the `` golden age '' of athens , the mold for all european civilizations alexander the great - spread hellenic culture/greatest warrior to ever live/was the `` mold '' all roman emperors followed ( the first thing a roman emperor did after their coronation was visit alexanders coffin ) aristotle/plato/socrates yes , they are all greek but i view these men as the greatest since they built what it means to be european . 
  holy fuck . 
  when it pans to the right 7-8 seconds in . 
  the event horizon of this crisis is coming very soon, 
  because eastern ukraine was russian land for hundreds of years ? 
  most russians have family in eastern ukraine and vice versa . 
  it is simply a divided country and it is going to end in a bloody war just like syria, 
  if they were russian , they wouldnt be getting killed like this at random checkpoints , like human sacrifices . 
  if all you read is bbc/cnn you will think ukraine is 100 % ukrainian with a few pesky russians . 
  no , in crimea it was vast majority russian so they left ukraine . 
  in other parts it is around 40-50 % and they do not want to follow orders from kiev . 
  this is not propaganda , just harsh reality . 
  there is a massive divide between west and east ukraine and to think that sending troops to murder eastern ukrainians is going to solve anything , is foolish . 
  to put it into perspective when yanuovich was leading ukraine , every single member of parliament was from eastern `` pro-russian '' ukraine . 
  now that yatsenuk is leader , all members of parliament are from western ukraine . 
  this is a divide that is going to end bloody . 
  things are going to radically change in the next `` august 2008 '' event and it doesnt matter what gdp growth you had the previous year prior to it . 
  it is going to change everything . 
  you will say im an `` idiot '' for claiming this . 
  but do n't forget that there were people in 2006 who predicted exactly what would happen in august 2008 and these same people are already estimating a similar but exponentially larger event is coming again , mainly because there was no changes to the system after 2008 . 
  not really , i think china and russia are both doomed to failure also i personally believe that only the eu has the best chance to survive the shit-storm of the coming century, 
  wait until the next august 2008 happens , most experts give it around 5-10 years max . 
  most experts believe there are around 3-4 major bubbles going on simultaneously . 
  besides the growing real estate/student debt bubble that will explode by 2025 , there is something that dwarfs all others and that is the derivatives bubble which is placed somewhere between 700-1 ,500 trillion $ . 
  if you have ever spoken to a canadian in your life , you will realize they would have a revolution in the country if something like a canada/usa union was close to becoming reality from the political elite . 
  you can not integrate these extremists . 
  we will soon find out the hard way, 
  do you seriously think canadians want anything to do with usa ? 
  if there is a chance of an actual union where canada has to follow new laws made in dc , there will be riots and chaos in the streets of canada . 
  usa is going nowhere but down in the next few decades , especially when china/russia create the new currency reserve standard to replace the dollar . 
  `` terrorists '' aka citizens of ukraine who now will have no choice but to fight to the death . 
  murdoch places his son as director of vice vice is a murdoch propaganda network now and it shows in their heavy bias towards whatever position dc makes . 
  this is an interesting move by putin if true , he is building [ `` new russia '' ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/19/world/europe/what-is-putins-new-russia.html ), 
  ofcourse fuck the 1 million greeks that were killed in their ancestral homeland alongside the armenians . 
  ** us consul-general george horton reported , `` one of the cleverest statements circulated by the turkish propagandists is to the effect that the massacred christians were as bad as their executioners , that it was ' 50 -- 50 . ', 
  '' on this issue he comments : `` had the greeks , after the massacres in the pontus and at smyrna , massacred all the turks in greece , the record would have been 50 -- 50 -- almost . 
  '' ** ** as an eye-witness , he also praises greeks for their `` conduct [ ... ] toward the thousands of turks residing in greece , while the ferocious massacres were going on ... '' , which , according to his opinion , was `` one of the most inspiring and beautiful chapters in all that country 's history . 
  there 's been a large surge in uk older couples buying retirement homes on greek islands lately . 
  possibly related to this , imo . 
  who says we are n't ? 
  eu is the sleeping giant, 
  the resort area will be be centered around the new `` village '' , which will likely be where the 1020 suites are located . 
  i am sure they found a nice secluded spot on the island to make this happen , i cant wait to visit one day . 
  no massive massive benefit to greek citizens . 
  they want the `` ultra-wealthy '' to come here and party with their yachts . 
  when they get bored there they will go around to other greek islands and spend more cash in an afternoon then 10,000 uk students do in 2 weeks . 
  greece is working on a strategy to bring in the one tourist sector greece is missing out on . 
  the `` ultra-wealthy '' this mini monaco , in combination with the incredible new f1 race track on athens harbor , which will also be built around a luxury resort type area is going to bring in alot of these ultra-wealthy types . 
  and they will spend lots of cash and greeks will greatly benefit from it . 
  because islamic jihadists with eu passports is a european problem and this is a subreddit to discuss european issues . 
  we can all bury our heads in the sand if we like , but it wo n't make this problem go away . 
  yes , cyprus is a bit complicated issue technically it is not european since it is not really that close to the continent , but it has been inhabited by greek settlers since 2,000 bc if not earlier and been a major greek territory ever since . 
  in the end , the main reason it was allowed in the eu is because it is one of the most strategic locations on earth , which is why it has nearly a dozen if not more major foreign military bases , mainly us/uk on the greek territory, 
  the problem as seen in france and likely germany is this . 
  you do charge them , but the most years in jail you can give in 3-5 years which is nothing more than a `` badge of honor '' for these jihadists in fact , uk/french/german prisons is a literal breeding ground for jihadist ideology and many who enter prison as normal citizens leave as hardcore jihadist followers . 
  tldr : it 's going to get ugly, 
  [ ukrainian nationalists assault and humiliate man , force him to say '' glory to ukraine '' before throwing him off a bridge ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gqipes0khi ), 
  this is bizarre if true . 
  i remember reading about the last time he `` died '' this guy must be a legend among the isis ranks to always escape his `` death '', 
  isis is actually proven itself to be far more potent than al-nusra/qaeda in syria . 
  most saudis join nusra or the islamic front also . 
  isis started as isi ( islamic state of iraq ) in fallujah , centered around an ultra-extreme islamic ideology and knowledge of how to actually conduct guerilla warfare . 
  when the syrian war started , nusra were the top jihadist group and isi members joined nusra in the first 2 years of the war . 
  then as isi became more powerful and wealthier they broke away from nusra and formed isis , mainly consisting of iraqis . 
  they have been defeating nusra in a number of high-profile battles lately and many nusra/foreign jihadists are switching sides to isis . 
  i do n't think you have a clear understanding of what has happened in syria in the last few years the syrian protests happened and both sides killed each other ( like in ukraine 15 police and 20 protesters dead ) within a week it turned into a legitimate revolution with most world leaders predicting it would be over within 3 months maximum 2 years pass and the initial revolutionaries are all but obsolete and powerless as islamic jihadists from across the muslim world ( as fa as indonesia ) come to syria and form extremely powerful militant groups . 
  al-qaedas official syrian branch jabhat al-nusra and the other main jihadist group isis are by far the two most powerful `` rebel '' groups in syira . 
  i put rebel in quotation marks because the idea of a syrian revolution is not the primary goal of these and other jihadist groups . 
  the goal is to turn syria into an islamic sharia state and from syria begin expanding into other countries and form a new `` caliphate '' / muslim empire . 
  the european jihadists all either join isis or nusra as these two groups are open to all foreigners and they are most foreign dominated . 
  they are beyond extreme on ideological beliefs and are willing to `` martyr themselves for their cause . 
  these isis/nusra jihadists are coming back to europe in droves and will be training the future jihadists of europe,
