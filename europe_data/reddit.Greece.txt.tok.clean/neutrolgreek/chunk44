  i would try it there has been a huge credit card scandal that is being suppressed by media where rfid chip credit cards are being hacked without even touching the card - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llafhtjsqhw now imagine someone using this rfid hack on your id . 
  they will have your name/adress/etc / fingerprints ? 
  after israel/canada we can maybe get singapore to join the eu . 
  greek-orthodox churches are the oldest churches in armenia/syria . 
  in syria for example , the ancient christian town of maloula where jesus 's language is still spoken is greek-orthodox there are around 500,000-1 million greeks who associate themselves with paganism , even do rituals and things like that . 
  i do not know much about them or how serious they are about their religion but i find it interesting either way, 
  greek orthodox and russian orthodox churches are separate but obviously have great respect for each other as do russian and greek people have great respect for each other . 
  not an `` ethnic '' unity , but definitely a `` brotherhood '' sort of unity , same with serbians . 
  the religion itself greek-orthodox is the oldest christian religion on earth as the greeks were the first mass converts to christianity and built the earliest christian shrines . 
  and is an evolution of the greek pagans . 
  to convince the greeks to convert to a monotheistic religion and see a homeless man as a prophet they had to give jesus alot of greek mythology traits such as the ressurection , turning water to wine , walking on water , etc. 
  i view christianity as logical evolution of pagan beliefs . 
  there were still greek pagans up until the ottomans arrived , but during ottoman occupation greek-orthodoxy became synonymous with greek ethnicity, 
  there are ways to remove the chip, 
  poland is good at this politics thingy, 
  i have no idea how others view them . 
  but i like them good , honest people imo, 
  [ the homecoming of europe 's jihadi volunteers ( or \u00e9migr\u00e9s ) from syria remains an enduring source of public disquiet . 
  that battle-hardened and radicalized muslim-european passport holders would return to leverage acquired `` skills '' at home is a specter haunting law enforcement across the continent . 
  a recent discovery by french police of some 1000 + grams of explosives , nails and bolts in the apartment of a recently repatriated jihadi \u00e9migr\u00e9 , did little to assuage such concerns .

  tip - get barefoot style shoes like vibrams or just go fully barefoot like i do sometimes and run on grass .

  jews identify with religion as the core of their identity the greeks are the same , you can not be greek if not orthodox christian . 
  other regions of europe also had similar ethnic histories with religion ... 
  it 's only in very modern times where religion in much of europe has faded ... greece is an anomaly in this respect, 
  `` only jews have a common identity '' nice one read some history you dunce . 
  greeks will be the last place your cultural genocide of europe takes hold because , yes . 
  not just jews have an identity,

  yeh me too , i have some family in chios but i doubt they would be able to do much , alot of these guys are dressed in army fatigues so i am guessing alot of them are doing this as part of their military service , as in create the fireworks by hand , set everything up , light them and clean the entire town the next day .

  most likely the rise of a top mafia family that has organized all the smaller ones into a hierarchy to maximize profits in new york the mafia families stopped killing each other when one family became the most powerful and kept the peace . 
  these people think on a medieval mind-set so might = right, 
  main reason ukraine and japan nuke reactors failed is due to extreme incompetence . 
  and that is an understatement . 
  ukraine had a drunken fool go on a power binge ( soviet hierarchy ) and order reactors to go beyond its maximum capability and japan placed back-up power generators on sea level surface in an area that had a tsunami in recent history ( 200 years ),

  what is the reason ? 
  thanks eu,

  yes , exactly what i thought putin/lavrov are chess grand-masters of international politics , this move of the chessboard is to send a signal of `` good-will '' fully knowing that there will soon be a blood-bath in eastern ukraine when the battles start to get intense , russia will use this moment as a sign it was trying to do the right thing before it did have to intervene .
