  a mach 5 missile going through chaotic air maneuvers is not going to be affected by laser tech also there are likely hard counters to the laser tech such as putting a reflective anti-laser material on the outer shell of missiles or even possibly drones in the future . 
  laser tech is very very useful , but not against anti-air systems or against fighter jets . 
  the future of warfare is going to be heavily drone centered so laser tech will be very useful against re-con drones, 
  syria doesnt even have a single s-300 . 
  let alone the pmu1 ( what greece has ) or pmu2 israel lost their shit when russia was going to send one to iran , russia decided not to send it in the end, 
  laser technology is useful but not the way you think it is . 
  laser technology is only capable of destroying something that is moving fairly slow and in a predictable angle , this is needed for the laser to do its job which is to damage the outer shell . 
  laser technology = very useful against recon drones , mortars , helicopters not useful against a missile going mach 5 or a jet breaking the speed of sound, 
  all 50 of them, 
  wrong and right first you are right that usa/eu is 1-2 generations ahead of nearly every major military technology , most importantly fighter jets and drones you are wrong in one aspect the russians figured out they were 1-2 generations behind in jet technology in the 80 's / 90 's ( they are not delusional ) instead of trying to play catch up , which is impossible they decided to focus their entire military technology effort into a counter-balance of usa 's jet technology which is why russians have the best anti-air missile technology on earth , easily 1-2 generations ahead of usa . 
  the s-300 pmu2 ( upgraded s-300 ) is considered vastly superior than the new patriot systems . 
  the s-400 is the ultimate stealth jet killer and anti-ballistic nuke killer , easily 2 generations ahead of anything usa has and the s-500 is underway and likely already completed with even rumors of an s-1000 system, 
  imo , the biggest problem in southern italy is the complete domination of the organized mafia in these places . 
  i saw a documentary recently where basically every liittle store , be it a one-person small business to a larger fashion store all had to pay a large amount of money to the mafia for `` protection '' the big thing in the documentary i saw is that there a few stores that are rising up and posting big signs on their store windows that says basically `` i do not and will never pay mafia any money '' most stores and businesses still pay out of fear and i do not blame them . 
  the mafia always gets theirs , either by cash or by blood . 
  it is a very scary situation, 
  hilary clinton is a fucking evil , evil . 
  truly fucking evil crazed cunt a warmonger and cold , calculating opportunist , basically the female version of little finger,

  [ ** `` a kind of anti-society has grown up in them -- a population that derives the meaning of its life from the hatred it bears for the other , `` official , '' society in france . 
  this alienation , this gulf of mistrust -- greater than any i have encountered anywhere else in the world , including in the black townships of south africa during the apartheid years '' ** ] ( http://www.city-journal.org/html/12_4_the_barbarians.html ) ** that is one of the reasons that , when i approached groups of young men in les musiciens , many of them were not just suspicious ( though it was soon clear to them that i was no member of the enemy ) , but hostile . 
  when a young man of african origin agreed to speak to me , his fellows kept interrupting menacingly . 
  `` do n't talk to him , '' they commanded , and they told me , with fear in their eyes , to go away . 
  the young man was nervous , too : he said he was afraid of being punished as a traitor . 
  his associates feared that `` normal '' contact with a person who was clearly not of the enemy , and yet not one of them either , would contaminate their minds and eventually break down the them-and-us worldview that stood between them and complete mental chaos . 
  they needed to see themselves as warriors in a civil war , not mere ne\u2019er - do-wells and criminals .

  well , this issue has escalated a bit in the last 24 hours . 
  russia/putin came out with a statement that they require 5 billion $ asap or the gas gets cut off right now and an additional 20-30 billion in fines and penalties . 
  still pretty depressing, 
  ** the institute for economic studies ( iee ) , a madrid think tank with ties to corporations that oppose separation , recently published a report that said madrid had the right to use troops to quell a catalan rebellion . 
  the iee report also likens conservative spanish prime minister mariano rajoy to abraham lincoln for defending the spanish constitution , and indirectly equates the situation with the illegitimate american south during the civil war . 
  ** every time i point out here that spain is heading to a civil war , i get 20-40 downvotes , the future of 21st century wars will mainly revolve around civil wars between 2 major ethnic/religious divides within the country . 
  as seen in syria with sunni vs shia/alawite/secular civil war now in ukraine with ukraine vs russians near future in spain with catalan vs spainish and 20-40 years from now when places like marseilles are 70 % + islamic, 
  the biggest threat by nukes is not the ones being fired from russia itself , where range issues can come into play for certain scenarios . 
  the biggest nuke threat are the dozens if not hundreds of nuclear weapon equipped submarines out there , the vast majority if not all are in areas we have no clue or knowledge about for their location .

  [ japonica ceo - why i brought 4 billion in greek bonds ] ( http://youtu.be/eplhpqs2bgk?t=1m23s ), 
  videos like this make me appreciate how lucky i am for the greek islands, 
  syriza to me is pasok 2.0 , the party that brought the crisis onto greece in the 1st place . 
  its leader tsipras is the type of person who can speak for an hour straight and provide not a single item of substance in his speech . 
  he talks and acts like someone with no clue how the real world economy works . 
  i do n't know much about potami , some people accuse them of being puppets to split the syriza vote between radical left and center left . 
  but in my opinion they are just a natural party that has risen due to the failures of syriza being a competent party to lead greece . 
  right now new democracy ( current government ) and syriza ( radical left ) are tied in polls with around 30 % each a new center-left party called `` to potami '' ( the river ) is now in 3rd place with around 10-15 % of the vote and golden dawn is 4th with around 5-10 %, 
  a lot has happened for the better in government firstly the public sector has been cleared a bit with 200,000 people let go , greece had a major problem with to many public workers and the entire public sector is more efficient and people actually have to work hard to keep their job . 
  corruption arrests have been the major news of the last 2 years in greece , basically the samaras government has spent massive resources on finding all those who were corrupt pre-crisis and taking their money and sending them to jail . 
  [ greek tax office of the future ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/04/07/theocharis-greek-tax-office-of-the-future/ ) [ greece sheds 200,000 state jobs in four years ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/04/07/greece-sheds-200000-state-jobs-in-four-years/ ) things like going to tax prison and corruption charges against the elite which was unheard of pre-2008 is basically a daily occurrence now in greece . 
  greece has posted a surplus for the last year and is continuing this trend in 2014 , so government spending is getting much more efficient . 
  it is not perfect by any means , but it is a much better system than pre-2008, 
  greek gdp/capita is 23,000 $ serbia gdp/capita is 5,000 $ the problem was not ever `` living beyond means '' . 
  this is pure bullshit meant to place the blame on the normal citizens . 
  most people own a small home ( usually passed down ) and one car per family . 
  thats it . 
  the problem with greece is government spending like drunken idiots , especially when it came to high-tech military gear . 
  rupert murdoch brought them out few months ago and put his son in charge . 
  it should officially just be known as a propaganda network like murdoch 's other media properties . 
  who gains the most from uk leaving the eu ? 
  exactly, 
  lots of horror stories of people getting snatched with a few joints at a club/beach party and spending years in a hell on earth prison no thanks . 
  plot twist : the robots become sentient and follow the chav lifestyle, 
  * bungee cord foreign policy * yes exactly . 
  it seems the uk government is unable to comprehend foreign policy beyond the next quarterly profits report, 
  the uk government has been the main european support of the terrorists in syria . 
  if this does end up happening , i wonder if the uk people will hold them responsible . 
  a renegotiation of the debt is already in the works and has been for a while . 
  greece first has/had to prove it can show a surplus , last year it was a small surplus of 2-3 billion and this year on track for a 8-10 billion surplus , with 2015 a 10-15 billion surplus a possibility . 
  my prediction is debt negotiations will begin sometime in 2015 before elections, 
  if you ask any greek if they prefer the fake economy built on debt of 2004-2007 or today 's realistic growth and re-building of the greek economy , 100 % would prefer to stay as it is now and continue . 
  greece is rapidly turning around and even rating agencies like moody 's and s&p 's which always lags 1-2 years behind actual on the ground developments is seeing the turn-around and stability and thus raising our ratings . 
  in just the few months of this year greece has posted a 2 billion surplus for the 1st 3 months of 2014 . 
  for comparison the first 3 months of 2013 had a 1.5 billion deficit . 
  this week alone , the massive plot of land in prime athens real-estate which used to be the location of the old athens airport was finally sold off for a billion $ and construction will begin soon there for a luxury destination . 
  investors are coming back to greece and the re-building is going strong . 
  i honestly do not see a situation where catalan leaves spain without a bloody war . 
  madrid also has around 10 million youths they could care less about and they might even find beneficial to put to the meat grinder . 
  syria 2.0 possibility is extremely high here . 
  if you want to go kill millions of innocent woman and children in the middle east , it is not nato 's responsibility,

  by millions i mean iraq/afghanistan mainly , not ww2 usa turned a country of extremely tense sunni vs shia centuries old rivalry which was controlled with an iron fist by saddam into what it is currently , an unreported war where thousands die every month now . 
  large parts of iraq are now in the hands of isis and usa policy of arming and training terrorist in syria ( one of the last countries on earth without us controlled central bank ) just shows the morally corrupt ideology usa is living by .

  russian ambassadors know they are being phone tapped at all times 2 . 
  the conversation started with `` shalom '' in a joking fashion 3 . 
  the entire convo sounded like two drunks having a laugh and bullshitting i can only imagine the cia guy who overhead this , shitting his pants and having no idea of russian humor . 
  the entire us economy exists only due to the fact that it is the worlds reserve currency aka petrodollar and they are willing to kill millions of innocent people to keep it that way . 
  the us dollar got this ultimate reward as a condition in the marshall plan and the dollar has been the most stable currency since . 
  china/russia have been hoarding thousands of tons of gold for a real possibility that they will create a new `` gold '' standard to replace the dollar in petro deals . 
  if this happens , the usa will become one giant detroit . 
  there are around 2,000 honor killings officially reported in turkey every year . 
  it is also known that only a small amount of actual honor killings get reported as honor killings - http://www.csmonitor.com/world/2011/0414/turkey-grapples-with-spike-in-honor-killings like i said dozens a week , and not only in eastern kurdish areas but also mostly in the capital and constantinople . 
  also it is idiotic to compare a culture from 600 years ago to modern day culture . 
  do you see any greeks honor killing today ? 
  that was in 2008 and looks to be from a religious group .
