  oh i know the irish in greece , i have seen some irish with some serious sun burns . 
  the scots are the only ones who understand how to handle the greek island sun in moderation, 
  med countries = normal white uk = sickly pale white that get 3rd degree burns after one hour in the sun, 
  say what you will about farage , but he is a damn good politician, 
  putin 's plan is to make crimean citizens standard of living dramatically rise all around , pensions/minimum wage/investments/low gas prices/etc by next winter when ukraines gas prices will be anywhere from 4-8x higher than before the revolution and imf/eu austerity program in full swing which will decimate the already incredibly horrible state of the ukrainian economy , this is when putin will strike . 
  but before he does , he will wait for much of eastern ukraine to be in open revolt/riots and wanting to join russia . 
  many people will get killed in these riots , which will quickly turn into skirmishes between anti and pro russian hooligans/groups when enough blood is spilled , putin will justify the invasion of eastern ukraine , and possibly the majority of it, 
  it would honestly be pretty shocking if they do leave, 
  just real politk, 
  if japan goes to war , china will declare war on them in the chaos, 
  honor killings , dozens of females being murdered by their own blood every week . 
  i can not even imagine belonging to the same planet as someone who does such a thing . 
  great `` diplomacy '' . 
  this is such a crazy way of thinking . 
  irish people consider themselves 100 % european and yet they are the same geographically . 
  your entire ancient history revolves around europe , so i will never understand that way of thinking just because your a few miles off the coast of mainland europe, 
  reunification will never happen , the greek cypriots and israelis have allied to exploit the oil/gas in israeli/cypriot waters and are working together to build a new proposed `` eastern mediterranean pipeline '' which will go form israel-cyprus and then to southern greece , and from greece it will feed the eu with gas/oil reunification = less profits for greece cypriots so it will never happen . 
  santorini is perfect in september , alot less tourists then the july-august rush so you can have more of the island to yourselves santorini is basically the `` official '' greek honeymoon island http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lozsj8vfwo, 
  good thing we are nothing like romania, 
  it is mostly naive tourists who give them money, 
  it should, 
  the saudis literally control an entire army in the syrian rebellion , the islamic front . 
  saudi arabia just today negotiated a deal with obama to give the if an arsenal of state-of-the-art anti-aircraft technology ( gps trackers on each unit ) they have massive political ambition outside their turf and now have an official proxy army with modern weaponry . 
  turkey needs saudis more than vice versa imo if turkey really does want to `` unite '' all muslims . 
  turkey sees itself as the potential leader of sunni muslims . 
  but so does saudi wahhabis and many other factions . 
  syria has shown that even within the sunni dominated rebellion , there are groups that consider each other `` non-believers '' even though they are all sunni . 
  you can not unite something that can not even unite in a small-scale conflict like syria i say small scale , because the only way that an ottoman `` successor '' can come to be is through massive bloodshed and the entire middle east in war with turkey coming out on top . 
  if in a small scale war like syria there are various sunni factions that think each other as `` non-believers '' . 
  imagine a region-wide conflict involving turkey/saudi vs iran/syria/hezbollah . 
  the only ones capabale of uniting a version of islam under one wing is iran as i have not heard a single incident of shia fighters turning on each other for their beliefs . 
  sunni islam is to divided between various camps like wahabism , muslim brotherhood and more secular turkish sunni to ever imagine it being united under a ottoman successor . 
  the only way it will be possible for turkey to accomplish this is for erdogan to openly embrace wahhabism/al-qaeda ideology and unite the extremists/radicals/saudis into a political party is that really what you want for turey ? 
  to turn into a extremist sunni territory ? 
  you realize that the only thing this will accomplish is never ending terror ? 
  i made a thread about this recently , but what you said is already in the works . 
  [ seven eu states create military drone ` club ' - the scheme was agreed in brussels on tuesday ( 19 november ) at a meeting of the european defence agency ( eda ) , the eu 's defence think tank , by france , germany , greece , italy , the netherlands , poland and spain . 
  ] ( http://euobserver.com/defence/122167 ) the future of the `` european army '' will be a drone army led be these countries . 
  cheaper yes , better prepared no . 
  you will always have those who excel at military profession and become special forces/seals/rangers types which greece has , these people would be there regardless of mandatory service or not . 
  the thing is that having 1 million people ready to go and prepared for a surprise attack/invasion is critical imo especially for a country like poland/greece which has a history of these things . 
  i think it has to do with prices also beer is dirt cheap in germany for example in greece you can buy a bottle of locally made retsina wine for same price as a beer, 
  you are crazy . 
  that is the best way to make simple at home foods for many many things . 
  are you even italian !!? 
  simple home made french-fries - cut potato into slices , put it into frying pan with olive oil for few minutes = great homemade dish . 
  i could go on with plenty more simple recipes i is dissapoint, 
  i 've seen countless quite old english couples just minding their own business in greece, 
  me neither . 
  greece and southern italy are the definition of `` old europe '', 
  i have no clue what the old/new is supposed to mean but it makes no sense for southern italy and greece to be `` new '' europe . 
  southern italy/greece literally created europe in the old european times . 
  europe itself is an ancient greek word for the name of the continent only thing on this graph i disagreed with . 
  street food is also extremely popular in greece also during festivals , it is 100 % normal to eat on the go during a festival but i do not normally see it outside of that . 
  ** breaking news ** [ turkish foreign minister calls syria security leak a declaration of war ] ( http://english.ahram.org.eg/news/97716.aspx ) [ turkey retaliates for stray shell ] ( http://news.yahoo.com/turkey-retaliates-stray-shell-syria-191853097.html ) last link is very breaking , i believe the false flag plan is still in action, 
  ofcourse not . 
  nato can do no wrong . 
  only russia, 
  he called it `` villainous '' you are correct , it was a top story on reuters just now . 
  it says alot about erdoghan that he organized a 5,000 strong terrorist battalion to attack the last ancient armenian village in syria this week ( kessab ) turkey is being governed by a terrorist sunni-supremacist mafia , and the scary part is that 50 % + of the country is proud of that fact . 
  `` do you like my tie ? '', 
  anything that a adds more jobs is of utmost importance also , your a cunt . 
  never forget 2004, 
  you know me personally ? 
  i was explaining greek origin of word in a comment yesterday , how have you not noticed considering you losers spend half your time pouring through past posts to create an ad hominem attack against someone . 
  usa killed more civilians in the 1st hour of the 1st day of the 2003 iraq invasion than the entire serbian war . 
  stories of hundreds of woman and children hudled together in bomb shelters being blown to bits by bunker busters . 
  and millions more dead from the chaos in the following years . 
  and now iraq is a nightmare where they average 3-5 ,000 civilian deaths a month from internal power struggles usa created . 
  but its ok because usa did it , right ? 
  usa has lost all credibility and moral high-ground with the iraq/afghan wars and the non-stop drone bombings of civilians . 
  nobody cares what you have to say any more , only the eu has moral high-ground left in this world . 
  ( but barely ), 
  some links - http://qz.com/67069/the-tech-scene-in-greece-is-booming-thanks-to-desperation-and-60-youth-unemployment/ [ eric schmidt of google : athens can become a mecca of technology ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2013/10/10/eric-schmidt-of-google-athens-can-become-a-mecca-of-technology/ ) http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/02/26/greek-prime-minister-150-billion-euros-revenue-from-hydrocarbons/, 
  45 shekels joking aside . 
  you realize that greece is a soverign country correct ? 
  not everything greece does has to be approved by germany , although it does seem that way . 
  this is an investment strategy on multiple fronts . 
  tourism industry - people can not be seperated by the internet in the modern day without going through withdrawls . 
  people who go to greece from now , will view it as a major positive that they can be on the beach/museum/etc and have access to the internet to share stuff with friends and communicate . 
  greece 's best tourism strategy is making the experience so good that the people who go tell their friends about their positive experience and then they go also , this strategy has been working for greece for many decades and this is just another aspect of it . 
  athens/thessaloniki are going to be major technology hubs in the coming decade , this 1st step is to build the groundwork so most start-ups can get to work and more young people have the tools to learn and develop . 
  as the gas/oil money ( 10 % signed into law for tech research already ) comes in by 2020 , things will come into place to build a massive tech industry in these areas, 
  are you r/europes police force ? 
  i have never seen anyone on any forum/website in my life being such a cunt to fellow members , constantly hounding them and ridiculing them . 
  you are not even fucking european , why the fuck do you think we give a shit what you think ? 
  serbians are my orthodox brothers and i will support them no matter what , good or bad so i am biased . 
  but every serbian person i have ever met would give you his last piece of bread if we were starving . 
  i can not say the same for a selfish , piece of shit like you . 
  it is a beautiful island , do n't be . 
  i am 99 % sure mccain is just a human costume of an evil alien being , like in men in black who requires 20 sugar waters every day, 
  i think it is logical to assume that anti-eu parties like the far-right parties around europe are pro-russian . 
  far-right and anti-eu are in the same mindset , not to say that all anti-eu parties are pro-russian . 
  why does everything have to be a russian conspiracy ? 
  i have been noticing this alot lately on reddit , nearly everything is now a russian conspiracy . 
  this party is likely anti-russian as much as it is anti-immigrants . 
  that is sad , i never knew the plight of the greenland people,
