  usa unveiled their prototype of their first drone jet fighter that can take off aircraft carriers - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lalhkookr74 the future of air-force is something called `` cloud drones '' meaning that an entire force of drone jet fighters are linked up with 5-6 surveillance drones ( both big and small ) and they work together for their mission . 
  this is also why the f-35 is a failure , they started it in the late 80 's and are only almost done building it as the future has shown itself . 
  it makes perfect sense actually , putin and co. 's biggest fear is that the russian people will look at ukraine and start thinking `` we can do that too '' putin does not want peace , he must/needs to go to war with ukraine . 
  everything that happens now is putin trying to instigate a `` pearl harbor '' style attack so that he has a `` legitimate '' excuse to begin his war . 
  the sleepers have been activated, 
  if money was not an issue , i would always go for this `` stealth '' look also , just for the fact that it provides an awesome `` psychological '' fear aspect . 
  this tank , really looks frightening , i would not want to go up against it certainly just for how intimidating it looks . 
  in modern and even moreso in future wars , every inch of the front lines will be monitored by drones both small and big . 
  drones do not use radar tech , they use heat-seeking cameras to spot people/tanks very easily . 
  unless this tank releases no heat while driving around , it can be spotted by any type of drone . 
  the pegasus 1 and 2 drones were made by hellenic aerospace industry ( hai or eab from the greek initials ), 
  i do know that `` stealth '' armor is a gimmick and has no real usefulness in actual war . 
  also , my point is that you can train almost anyone to be a `` tank-killer '' within a month of training . 
  tanks have been largely ineffective in syria for this very reason . 
  the best use of them i have seen , is actually as a stationary artillery unit protected by mountains of sand bags and bricks on its armor . 
  the saa usually have 1-2 tanks set up this way around each checkpoint or base . 
  once the tanks is moving , it usually gets killed by an atgm , and `` stealth '' armor is not going to protect you . 
  again , is there any scenario where `` stealth '' armor is useful , because all i see is a gimmick , a very cool looking one , that makes for great marketing though . 
  they recently unveiled their own uk made fighter drone , it is an amazing piece of engineering . 
  it looks cool , but is it proven ? 
  no also the idea of a `` stealth '' tank is kind of ridiculous . 
  i 've seen dozens , if not at least a hundred `` tank-kill '' videos from syria , using atgm ( anti-tank guided missile ) the biggest threat a tank has is not being spotted by a plane but by the single trained guy with an atgm missile that can fire a pin-point shot onto the tank and killing everyone inside . 
  the moment that tank fires a single shot , the stealth is gone and its as open to an atgm as any other tank . 
  atgm 's are wire guided , meaning that stealth wo n't affect its usefulness at all . 
  can someone give me a scenario where `` stealth '' tank armor is useful ? 
  because i can not think of any . 
  better thing ? 
  greece has had a drone program since the late 70 's , they were likely the driving force behind this alongside germany . 
  greece is going to spend a ridiculous amount of money each year on its military either way . 
  this is just a great long-term investment on their part . 
  it would make sense if putin follows the drowned god, 
  un-sung heroes of ww2 were the greeks stalin : * `` i am sorry because i am getting old and i shall not live long to thank the greek people , whose resistance decided wwii . 
  '' * ( from a speech of his broadcast by the moscow radio station on 31 january 1943 after the victory of stalingrad and the capitulation of marshal paulus ) georgy constantinovich zhoucov 1896-1974 marshal of the soviet army : * `` if the russian people managed to raise resistance at the doors of moscow , to halt and reverse the german torrent , they owe it to the greek people , who delayed the german divisions during the time they could bring us to our knees . 
  '' * ( quote from his memoirs on wwii ), 
  yup , defensive, 
  eu does not need carriers , carriers are for invading countries not defending . 
  greece is the only country in europe ready for all out war in a moments notice . 
  and not many people know greece has one of the best air forces on earth , main training partner to us/israel . 
  4 months ago the largest air force training exercise in history took place in israel with greece and usa . 
  largest tank force in europe with 500 brand new m1a1 abrams and hundreds of leopard 2 a6 greece has had a drone program since the 70 's and recently became part of the eu `` drone club '' which is 7 countries including germany , france and poland . 
  goal is to create a fighter drone by 2020 . 
  greece has spent way more than 2 % of gdp on military ... it is likely closer to 5 % for the last 40 years,

  the `` protestors '' were armed to the teeth and many syrian police officers were murdered in the first few days of the `` protest '' . 
  there are local reports of saudi wahhabis handing out guns like candy so things could escalate ( saudi arabia was a major player alongside us/uk ) what do you think would happen in us/uk/sweden if `` protestors '' started gunning down officers ? 
  i would say even worse than assads response . 
  within a week of the first protest it was full-blown civil war , almost as if it has been planned . 
  i am not saying assad is a good guy , i am saying that western interests wanted him out so they could put a western puppet ( idriss preferably ), 
  [ according to former french foreign minister roland dumas , britain had planned covert action in syria as early as 2009 : `` i was in england two years before the violence in syria on other business '' , he told french television : `` i met with top british officials , who confessed to me that they were preparing something in syria . 
  this was in britain not in america . 
  britain was preparing gunmen to invade syria . 
  '' ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2013/aug/30/syria-chemical-attack-war-intervention-oil-gas-energy-pipelines ) [ according to retired nato secretary general wesley clark , a memo from the office of the us secretary of defense just a few weeks after 9/11 revealed plans to `` attack and destroy the governments in 7 countries in five years '' , starting with iraq and moving on to `` syria , lebanon , libya , somalia , sudan and iran . '', 
  in a subsequent interview , clark argues that this strategy is fundamentally about control of the region 's vast oil and gas resources . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rc1mepk_sw ) `` in 2009 - the same year former french foreign minister dumas alleges the british began planning operations in syria - assad refused to sign a proposed agreement with qatar that would run a pipeline from the latter 's north field , contiguous with iran 's south pars field , through saudi arabia , jordan , syria and on to turkey , with a view to supply european markets - albeit crucially bypassing russia . 
  assad 's rationale was `` to protect the interests of [ his ] russian ally , which is europe 's top supplier of natural gas . '', 
  now go back to watching eurovision, 
  russia has a massive tech advantage in anti-air systems the s-300 pmu2 outperforms the patriot system in every way and the s-400 is a stealth bomber + nuke killer usa focused on jet technology while russia focused on anti-air systems . 
  also it would be impossible to convince modern german and brits to go fight for ukraine against russia also us/uk has absolutely no moral high ground considering they were the main instigators of the syrian war and fund/train foreign jihadist `` rebels '' in their mid east games to weaken russia and iran,

  a law has already been passed that makes 90 % of gas profits go into this new `` social security '' fund based on the norweigan model . 
  greece is working with norway very closely as they are our main partners in the future of our hydrocarbon exploitation , they will also assist us with designing this fund like theirs . 
  10 % of gas profits have been signed into law to fund `` research projects '' while i do hope 99 % of that money is used wisely and im sure most of it will , there is room there for corruption . 
  alot of anti-corruption reforms have been made and are still being made so i hope this doesnt happen but we will see . 
  either way there will be alot of funding for greek projects in the future .

  the `` debt restructuring '' was an agreement made that if greece could post a surplus in 2013 they would get a re-structure .
