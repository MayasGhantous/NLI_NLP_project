  greece long-term projections are very positive considering multiple upgradings this year from rating agencies like s&p and economic deals made this year that would not have been possible without eu such as 15 + billion cosco-greece deal to make greece main headquarters of chinese shipping in eu and also the tap/emp/igb pipeline deals to make greece an energy hub of eu by 2020 . 
  none of those deals would have been made without greece being in the eu . 
  ukraine when it enters the eu will have a decade long struggle but after it settles it will have new opportunities like greece has,

  do you remember how during maidan that mysterious radio signal from russia/siberia changed its tone ? 
  i joked back then that it was a signal to `` activate the sleepers '' maybe i was n't wrong . 
  where did you see me say i wanted communism to win ? 
  the civil war should have never happened in the first place but it did and no good came out of it , only millions dead/injured and in poverty . 
  after the civil war greece was led into economic stagnation until democracy came back and greece joined the eu . 
  the fact is that greece did n't even begin to re-build from ww2/civil war until joining the eu, 
  communism vs west the government was a western-backed puppet after the civil war, 
  i agree with your first line , but just note post-ww2 while most of europe was recovering ( except soviet states ) greece went through a brutal civil war with as much dead as ww2 ( ww2 + civil war killed 15-20 % of greek population ) , then followed by a dictatorship that lasted decades . 
  [ `` the civil war left greece in ruins , and in even greater economic distress than it had been following the end of german occupation '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_civil_war#post-war_division_and_reconciliation ), 
   i wonder if you even realize how stupid the shit you type is . 
  because i do n't spend all day on european forums like this spreading pro-immigrant , pro-islam propaganda like you do ? 
  do n't you ever get tired of hating european natives ?

  sjw 's have no idea these people would love nothing more than to murder them and their family for being as welcome to homosexuals as they are of islam . 
  islamic state ideology does not just go against norms you fool , it goes against the entire way of life and society that europe has built by blood over 5,000 years . 
  did you miss the part where he had his team of 100 accountants work in greece for over a year ? 
  i think him investing 4 billion $ of his own money shows confidence of his findings, 
  it is relevant though . 
  also you can tell he is passionate about accounting/finance which makes it more interesting , especially considering he has been one of the most successful investors on earth since the 80 's, 
  debt + loan interest is tied together , that is why a debt re-structuring is so critical and why i do not understand there isnt a solid plan to accomplish this goal with the troika . 
  a debt re-structure can be followed with an economic stimulus plan to boost job creation . 
  it seems 6 years of austerity is not enough even after troika agreed that greece has met all its obligations . 
  greek pm samaras and merkel had an extensive meeting this morning in germany on the issue of debt re-structuring program and nothing came out of it from is being released so far of the meeting , obviously there can be a secret agreement for unknown reasons . 
  he brought the bonds because of a 12 month long due diligence accounting using his team of experts . 
  people like him , who make billions of dollars like we make a few thousand , do not play around and it shows by the amount of methodical work he made to find that `` real '' gdp/debt % ( again not my words , only his ) brussels accounting method which he explains in the video and which was used to find that 175 % bullshit number for greece uses a fake accounting method based on a theoretical `` futures '' accounting trick which brussels used to boost up that gdp/debt to insane levels . 
  this guy is a master at what he does , so i will take his word for it, 
  oh that makes more sense also youtube comments , which are known for their intellectual discussions and debates, 
   at max we might talk bad about greeks is it the albania # 1 greatest country , oldest country , most important in history ( evil greeks stole everything ) , etc type of shit-talk i see on the internet ? 
  greece has met its financial targets set by the troika for nearly 3 years , and has exceeded the targets every quarter for the last year and a half . 
  there is no reason not to negotiate on the 175 % debt and to lower it since that number was completely made up by the troika/imf when greece had a weak leadership . 
  according to [ japonica ceo , kazarian ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eplhpqs2bgk ) , brussels used a corrupt form of accounting to inflate that number for no other reason than to manipulate greek politics and this 175 % gdp/debt has no basis in reality . 
  kazarian sent a team of ** 100 ** accountants to greece in early 2013 and spent 8-12 months going through every single paper of the greek government and in his own words `` the most rigorous accounting method known to man '' to find what he says is the true number of gdp/debt of greece which is lower than 100 % . 
  wsj - [ imf admits mistakes on greece bailout ] ( http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/sb10001424127887324299104578527202781667088 ) a debt re-structuring using proper methods and an actual government in place this time could bring greek debt way down to normal number and help the economy in a number of ways . 
  i have no idea why merkel is still stalling, 
  this symbol was found on top of king philip 's burial site in greece and has become a national symbol . 
  fyrom agreed to not use this symbol in signed agreement between both countries . 
  this is clearly a provocation as this is a member of parliament holding a controversial flag on top of a greek historical mountain . 
  just a reminder why fyrom will never join eu or nato, 
  is there any type of abuse/injustice from romanian authority that would warrant such a vote ? 
  [ ancient makedon is entirely within modern greece ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/expansionofmacedon.jpg ) modern inhabitants of fyrom appeared around 1,000-1 ,200 years after the makedon kingdom had ceased to exist . 
  for one , ancient makedon borders are entirely within modern greece . 
  most importantly though there is a clear line of progression in greek society from hellenic age  fall of makedon 148 bc  roman occupied greece  fall of rome  rise of byzantine greek orthodox people  fall of constantinople ( byzantine )  war of independence  today fyrom progression goes 1,000 ad slavic push into thracian territory north of greece ( no makedon identity )  ottoman era ( no makedon identity )  balkan wars ( no makedon identity even still )  ww1/2  post-ww2 ( we need an identity !, 
  )  post yugoslavia collapse ( we are 100 % pure makedons ! ), 
  modern greeks are not going around screaming they are 100 % pure makedons/spartans . 
  and attempting to steal historical figures from neighbors the identity of modern greeks is inter-twined with greek orthodoxy which was the main identity of the greeks during byzantine/ottoman era . 
  the ancient greek identity is inter-twined with paganism and tribalism . 
  the main identity of greeks has always been three things , greek mainland/island birthplace/roots , religion and language . 
  the byzantine mono-theistic greeks were the evolution of the tribal pagan greek city-states . 
  and for the most part every european country had the same evolution of pagan tribalists  mono-theistic/homogenous country, 
   ocs is n't greek , it 's slavic . 
  i agree , was n't trying to say it was not what i meant by `` hybrid '' greek/slavic is that some alphabet/grammar was borrowed , but like i said in previous comment , modern slavic is a far more evolved language that is not related to greek . 
  we could debate for a long time about the usefullness of tanks , lots of people are passionaite about this discussion on how useful they are , i personally believe they are very useful only if they are ultra-modern variations such as the leo 2 a6/hel tanks . 
  leo 2 hel ( modified leo 2 a6 built in greece ) for me is the best tank on earth and useful for one sole reason , top-mounted anti-tank/personal missile launchers ( you can see it about minute in the video ) in usual tank/urban warfare the tank is wide open for atgm/tow attacks by infantrymen , with the addition of missile launchers on the roof it changes everything . 
  as you can see in the video the tank is hidden behind a wall of protection , the missile launcher goes around 2 meters tall and launches the missiles to its target . 
  this transforms the tank from traditional use to a more sneaky/careful force on the battlefield . 
  again , its open to debate but i personally think tanks will always have a use on the battlefield , even in the future . 
  i understand that france/uk has superior air-force/navy , i was n't debating that anyway . 
  greek navy/air-force is incredibly under-rated though , but it is understandable since there has been no recent conflict , lots of training with israel though , which is keeping the navy/air-force really efficient and trained, 
  greek was the spread of greek orthodox from the byzantine empire was made possible by greek clergymen developing a hybrid greek/northerner language to spread the religion . 
  modern slavic is a far far more evolved language than was initially created by the orthodox church but those are its roots http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_church_slavonic  old church slavonic , also known as old church slavic ( often abbreviated to ocs ; self-name \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0463\u0301\u043d\u044c\u0441\u043a\u044a \u0469\u0437\ua651\u0301\u043a\u044a , slov\u011bn\u012dsk\u016d j\u0119zyk\u016d ) was the first slavic literary language . 
  the 9th century byzantine greek missionaries saints cyril and methodius are credited with standardizing the language and using it in translating the bible and other ancient greek ecclesiastical texts as part of the christianisation of the slavic peoples, 
  most people refuse to accept that slavery is anything other than `` evil europeans '', 
  by 1,000 ad when the slavic push came . 
  the `` macedonian/spartan/athenian '' identities had already ceased to exist for over a thousand years . 
  it depends what the goal is honestly france/uk has superior military in terms of invading foreign land , yes . 
  greek military is built as a defensive shield wall with the way it is set up . 
  each island acts as a launching pad for surprise attacks/weapons caches/air-force raids/naval raids/etc greece also has the 2nd or 3rd strongest tank-force on earth with leo 2 a6 / [ leo 2 hel 's ] ( http://youtu.be/vmtwps9ah-u?t=30s ) ( made in greece ) , [ modern air-force ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix62plqvkpu ) , [ modern navy ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryawllzpzau ) , etc . 
  click on links if you like military porn . 
  france/uk have great navy/air-force + special forces but i do not think they have hundreds of thousands of para-troopers/ground soldiers ready at a moments notice , could be wrong though as i do not know the exact numbers of para-troopers available in both countries . 
  there was no such thing as `` greek '' people back then each city-state was its own country tied around a greek culture of common [ language ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ancient_macedonian_language ) / religion . 
  the death of alexander the great to the fall of makedon in 148 bc is known as the '' [ hellenic age ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hellenistic_period ) '' which is also when makedon united all the greek people into the aechean hellenic league against the romans in the four roman wars ( fourth being the defeat in 148 bc ) you would think if macedonians were not greeks like you say that a macedonian minority would have existed through-out roman/byzantine/ottoman era . 
  but there never has been a macedonian minority ever in greek history . 
  by the time the greek byzantines rose to power after the fall of rome , 500 years after the fall of makedon . 
  the idea of being `` pure '' spartan/athenian/makedon was non-existant . 
  i was watching greek news this week and it is being treated like a reality show i agree , but at least it is better than the usual stuff on greek news like random actor/models or miley cyrus for the 100th time . 
  `` military weight '' greece has the only military in europe that is up to date in all 3 major areas of navy , ground forces , air-force . 
  greece is also becoming a energy & shipping hub of the eu by 2020 [ `` greece emerging as energy hub in south-eastern europe '' azerbaijani pm says as he hails `` new start for azerbaijan '' with signing of major gas deals between the two countries which will replace russian gas ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/09/19/samaras-meets-with-azeri-president-in-baku/ ) chinese shipping giant cosco just signed a 15-20 billion $ deal with greece to transform athens/thessaliniki harbor 's into the headquarters of chinese shipping operations into the eu also .

  did n't lebanon have the same scenario ? 
  hundreds of thousands of palestinians come to lebanon throwing off the demographics balance and causing alot of war in the country ?
