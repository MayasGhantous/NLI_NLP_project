  this is exactly how syria war started , deaths on both sides and blaming each other i think people greatly underestimate the ukrainians that support yanukovich and russia this is seriously looking like syria 2.0, 
  at the 25-26 second mark it looks like the riot cop was killed . 
  he gets up to run away and then looks like he gets shot and drops head first into the ground and then is dragged away .

  there was an agreement that greece could re-structure it 's debt if it posted a budget surplus in 2013 . 
  there was a 2 billion euro surplus but merkel had decided not to re-structure and vetoed it for political reasons . 
  it will likely happen in early 2015 if greece can post a surplus for 2014 now go back to educating yourself at r/polandball,

  that 's why rotating the marbles is the best solution . 
  it does not have to be the entire uk exhibit . 
  just 2-3 pieces , then next year they are switched for two others , etc , uk are good stewards of these priceless artifacts , that is one of the main reasons greece built the new state of the art acropolis museum . . to show this argument ca n't be used against us . 
  a rotating collection between greece and uk would be great , even if that means giving uk greek artifacts never before held in uk to rotate also . 
  there is a clear compromise imo, 
  i wish i could find a video that i saw a year ago that perfectly explained the reason this is . 
  basically , when uk/france decides to order ( for example ) hip replacements in mass bulk they have a bidding war between all the hip replacement companies . 
  so they can maximize quality/price and get the best deal possible . 
  in usa ... 
  i do not know the exact reason but this does not happen ... at all . 
  in usa the process begins and ends with the one and only hip replacement provider going to the government and going `` here is our hip replacement and at this price '' the price is usual 3-10x the uk/french price . 
  could be done by plane , also it does not have to be all the marbles . 
  only certain pieces that are rotated every year . 
  alexander himself said it was revenge for burning down athens and the acropolis, 
  i never understood why britain is so stubborn about making some kind of compromise with greeks over this issue . 
  i think something that could be fair to both countries is that the marbles are taken to greece during the summer tourist season and then around september/october brought back to uk . 
  is that seriously so hard to accomplish between two supposed close allies . 
  london mayor compares george clooney to hitler - [ clooney has boris johnson in a huff over elgin marbles ] ( http://www.newser.com/story/182333/london-mayor-compares-george-clooney-to-hitler.html ), 
  not a coincidence that serbian eu talks have taken giant leaps once greece took eu presidency . 
  greece will finally get an ally in the eu that 's not cyprus, 
  the face of satan, 
  greek islands, 
  there is no scenario where israel uses nukes and still exists as a country, 
  nukes are not an option as much as nationalist israelites dream of using them ( even on germany as revenge ) israel is a good ally to greece to counter turkey so i want israel to be strong , but nukes are not an option . 
  rodos = rhodes island , greece rodos is just the greek spelling, 
  rodos city - one of best beaches in europe with a unique stone diving board deep into the waters that you can swim too and dive off a few major nightlife spots ranging from a scandinavian bar street ( never seen so many drunk swedes ) , uk pub crawl streets , an outdoor cafe hotspot and my personal favorite and one of the most underrated places on earth . 
  a 1,000 year old massive castle city built by the knight templar ( built after loss of jerusalem ) it is simply incredible . 
  during the day it 's a huge hub for boutique shopping and relaxing and at night time it transforms into a huge party . 
  nightclubs in 1,000 year old cobblestone rooms , people dancing on the street ... 
  it gets wild . 
  i also love how 3,000 greeks still live inside the castle city in the ancient rooms , it is one of my dreams to one day be able to live there also . 
  \u03b5\u03c6\u03b9\u03ac\u03bb\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 ( efi\u00e1ltis ) greek word for nightmare i love it for its history , [ ephialtes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ephialtes_of_trachis ) was the traitor who betrayed the spartans during the battle of thermopylae , the greeks decided to enshrine his name forever in the single thing everyone hates and fears , nightmares . 
  right , of course germans are n't at fault ... delusional idiot, 
  so you do not consider the german companies caught bribing as corrupt ? 
  no , because the troika which represents german , french and uk interests does not want to harm their military profits from greece . 
  [ rec ] 1 & 2 from spain, 
  austerity has never touched the military budget from pressure from troika take an educated guess why that is, 
  at political level , yes there has been corruption at every level , which hopefully will be rooted out as more people are sent to prison . 
  the opening ceremony was not only the best olympics ceremony in history but one of the best live performance events ever i say pr success, 
  the lamb and potato must be cooked together in a large pan with a mixture of olive oil and other ingredients . 
  i do n't know exact recipe . 
  tzatziki is easy and takes 2 minutes to make . 
  simple greek yogurt ( fage brand ) in bowl . 
  then use a cheese grater on 1-2 cucumbers ( in other bowl , toss away excess water then mix it in with yogurt ) and 1-2 garlic + tiny vinegar and lemon = better and healthier than ketchup on anything . 
  one if my favorite simple greek foods is home cooked fries ( sliced + cooked in olive oil in frying pan ) and tzaziki . 
  how is the m1a1 abrams an outdated tank ? 
  it is a state of the art tank in every way and greece received 500 of them for free in zero-hour ( new ) condition + 50-100 tanks for parts scavenging + 5-10 tank simulators for training , for free . 
  greece now has one of the best tanks forces on earth . 
  what is the difference between bribes and `` legal donations '' . 
  they are both corruption and should be punishable by jail time . 
  also , this is not `` greek mentality '' . 
  it is the `` military industry '' mentality that i was explaning . 
  it is corrupt to the core . 
  the military industry contract negotiations has alot in common with world cup and olympic bidding process . 
  you might know this , but in world cup and olympics bidding , bribery is not only expected , it is well known that the highest briber will get awarded the world cup/olympics . 
  the same goes for the military industry , bribing is part of the process . 
  you are a fool to think it does n't happen in every country in europe , or just delusional idiot , most likely both . 
  as far as greece , the reason this is coming out is because greek government has been arresting dozens of pre-2008 government officials for bribery in military contracts process . 
  also samaras has said new laws will be made to prevent it from happening again . 
  i hope it is a success , but the corrupt military industry ( german , france , usa ) will likely still find a way to be corrupt . 
  [ your plate usually looks like this ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-un4ta1my-jq/tulxgjtc6ai/aaaaaaaalb8/krfwzlzsnpq/s1600/greek%2blamb%2bdecember%2b14th%252c%2b2011.jpg ), 
  that is how arms/military contracts are done in every country on earth . 
  the military industry is extremely shady and bribes politicians in every country on earth so they can get that contract signed . 
  if you have a 3 billion dollar contract on the line , you are going to hand out a few million to make sure the contract gets signed , it is sop and even in 1 million years ( if humans still exist ) it will still be the same . 
  eh greece/serb/romania / etcare orthodox christians . 
  you know the ones without an anti-christ ( pope ) as the leader and the ones who do n't rape children, 
  if by `` mixing '' you mean kidnapping greek children for 400 years , then yes . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/janissary greek and serb families had to hand over 1 son for every 4-5 children tens of thousands , possibly 100,000 + greeks stayed behind in turkey and became muslim to escape death during the greek genocide also, 
  if somebody offers you food and/or drink at their home , saying no is considered extremely rude and they might take it personally . 
  also , when the bill comes at the cafe/bar/etc , never look at the receipt and even dare to split it out perfectly , that is just a bad look . 
  instead if you know you owe 15-18 euros , just hand 20 euros . 
  could you explain ? 
  if you are with us on the `` macedonian '' issue then you are an ally , if not then you are n't . 
  i am not sure where most romanians stand on this issue . 
  yeh , i pissed off some mod in another subreddit that got my other account shadowbanned, 
  i think the point of this thread is showing how the current shitty government of ukraine is holding back the ukrainian people from greatness . 
  ukraine has the potential to be a world leader in computer software and it development and be a digital society like estonia . 
  but it will never happen with a bunch of mafiosi as your leadership, 
  typically the bin is tiny with a lid and plastic bag and is cleaned every day . 
  russia is also hosting the next world cup ( after brasil ) i honestly would not be surprised if they spent the majority of the sochi money on the world cup, 
  yup , i know spain produces the most but quality wise they are even , also our olives come from a tree donated by the goddess athena herself , you ca n't beat that .
