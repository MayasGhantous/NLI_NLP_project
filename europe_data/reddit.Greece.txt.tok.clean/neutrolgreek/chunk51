  yeh , and they are all terrible . 
  the only good commercial was the john stamos greek yogurt commercial `` take your pants off greek boy '' was funny , it felt like a full house reunion - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-qpmejvzu, 
  it would be nice for serbia to join eu just so greece could have at least one ally in the eu outside of cyprus , but i completely understand why most serbs would be against joining the eu , since for the most part , these are the same people who bombed your country in recent history . 
  so you do n't think free wifi is possible ? 
  i would think samaras would not say something with such confidence if was n't absolutely sure it would be feasible i am not a samaras `` fanboy '' . 
  but i think he is the most logically-minded politician greece has had in decades . 
  honestly now . 
  do you seriously think that goof-ball from syriza would do a better job ? 
  you do n't think posting the first surplus greece has had in a decade is a positive also ?

  did i say greece is perfect or anything like that ? 
  i just said `` on the right path '' . 
  there is still at least 10 years of struggle in front of us . 
  the tap deal like i have said many times before is the best/important thing to happen to greece in a decade . 
  and the ceo of japonica short interview + 4 billion investment in greek bonds has done more to uplift greece 's rating and investment confidence than the last 100 empty speechs by eu officials . 
  you do not understand how investment , economics and business work in the real world . 
  to put it simply . 
  investors and major players do not give a shit what politicians say , they look for any type of real investment and signs of confidence and from there it can rapidly turn into a snowball effect . 
  also , i think my current name suits me better bitch, 
  i feel like greece is on the right path for the first time in a decade and once this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trans_adriatic_pipeline is complete , greece will be the # 1 energy pillar of the eu , it will also lessen the strangle-hold of gas monopoly that russia has on europe . 
  the ceo of us investment firm japonica is also very positive on greece 's economic outlook - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eplhpqs2bgk and another interview with same ceo - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsnfxp1yn6s, 
  form a union between the 3 largest south american countries and economies colombia - brazil - argentina ( ? ), 
  if they can hold this union for 5-10 years , then invite 1-2 smaller countries etc until 40-50 years later all of south america is in it, 
  fukushima is no worse than 3 banana a day diet !, 
  they need some freedom \u2122, 
  they are not pawns to use, 
  you do have a nice ak-47 variant , likely the best ak-47 built outside of russia, 
  greek people take their olive oil very seriously , this is true any food really . 
  my parents will go on rants if they feel a feta cheese brand is not up to their standards, 
  germany does alot of shady stuff also , for instance `` greek beekeepers become latest casualty of european gm labelling war '' `` many believe that the move to prevent gmo containing honey to be labelled was brought about to serve the interests of countries such as spain which allow gm crops and the large , mainly german , companies importing honey from countries where use of gm crops is widespread such as canada , argentina and , increasingly , china . 
  currently about 50 % of the honey consumed in the eu is imported . '', 
  '' `` it puts us at a competitive disadvantage , '' ms karatasou said . 
  `` the advantage of greek honey is that about 90 % of it comes from natural ecosystems in non-cultivated land from beekeepers who move their bees from place to place . 
  this means that the quality is exceptional but we can not compete on price with the large honey producers . 
  labelling allows consumers to choose quality . '' all greek honey is by default gmo free given that gm crops are prohibited from being grown in the country . '', 
  so germany refuses to label their cheap , low-quality , gmo honey imported from china at the cost of organic honey producers in greece . 
  [ varoufakis the other day said that the possibility of an `` emergency tax '' from wealthy greeks is very high ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/02/28/greek-finmin-varoufakis-the-wealthy-will-pay-an-extraordinary-tax-if-needed/ ) syriza also announced that they are working to get 8-9 billion in euros from tax evasion cases by the end of summer . 
  right now the biggest risk is that there is still no `` official '' deal . 
  the eu/greek agreement made last weeks was to build a `` final '' agreement by the end of april . 
  syriza is currently in a rush to build the final list by end of march , instead of waiting until april . 
  i think any threats made are to push greek government to build this `` final '' list quickly , instead of end of april, 
  it is right in the center of many commercial passenger air-flights and shipping . 
  i think they under-estimate the eu then, 
  an entire generation of putin 's ? 
  if greece wanted money , it would just sign the 3rd bailout that everyone is demanding and sell off the entire country to privitization which these bailouts demand . 
  the entire point of syriza is that with the budget surplus and economic growth policies no external money is needed , ever again . 
  before 2008 not really since times were `` good '' , everyone was apathetic and apolitical during the `` good '' times and nobody had a clue what was going on . 
  since the crisis obviously things have changed . 
  [ the azerbaijan project is going really well at the moment ] ( http://www.naturalgaseurope.com/southern-gas-corridor-interview-with-joe-murphy-bp-22382 ) , the first caspian sea gas from azerbaijan will reach greek border by 2019 . 
  greece has already purchased 1 billion cubic meters , bulgaria has purchased 1 billion cubic meters to be sent through the soon to be built greece  bulgaria pipeline and italy has purchased 8 billion cubic meters that it will sell to northern europe . 
  10 billion cubic meters total by 2020 with it reaching 20 billion by 2025-2030 and plans for it to reach up to 40-60 billion cubic meters by 2050 . 
  the cigaratte/oil smuggling is not from greek mafia , it is from wealthy individuals mainly shipping owners that use tricks to bypass customs and smuggle , the previous government also knew about it but did nothing . 
  well one thing is that syriza are hard-line and have given much more power to the financial crimes unit and have created a ministry of anti-corruption/tax evasion which did not exist before . 
  the people who decide to play hard-ball and go to court will likely be thrown in prison to force them to pay up instead of wasting time . 
  the wealthy in greece might have money but they are facing a government and people that hate them now . 
  [ there are a few ski resorts in greece ] ( http://www.visitgreece.gr/en/activities/land_sports/skiing ), 
  [ this pic sums it up ] ( http://i.ytimg.com/vi/eh-y26lgcp0/hqdefault.jpg ), 
  [ three were arrested this morning ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_28/02/2015_547755 ) for 2 millions euros in evasion . 
  greek government has said that they will take 2-3 billion euros immediately and 7-8 billion in tax-evasion cases by the end of the summer . 
  around 5,000 cases amount for most of that money . 
  [ also the taxation overhaul was put into detail ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/02/27/greek-authorities-unveil-new-tax-control-plan/ ) , i would say it is going at a pretty good pace . 
  i expect a few very big cases soon to go public . 
  there is elections coming up very soon in spain , a new party called pondemos is winning almost every major poll in spain and looks like it will lead the country after elections . 
  pondemos is like a `` brother '' party to syriza and they have even publicly announced a partnership . 
  if syriza burns and crashes before the elections , this will be all the ammo the current government of spain needs to show the spanish voter that pondemos is dangerous and thus the current government would likely win . 
  that is really interesting , do young danes just throw in mega alot randomly to describe things ? 
  good point  my wording is wrong and non-scientific . 
  i was just trying to use layman 's terms i suppose . 
  basically lasithi plateau is nearly genetically identical to the minoan corpse , which i found really amazing when i read this study last year . 
  there was a genetic study done on a minoan corpse that was found in crete , modern inhabitants of [ lasithi plateau ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lasithi_plateau ) a small region of eastern crete were found to be nearly [ 95 % genetically identical to the corpse ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wcrlxrr.jpg ) [ here is the full study ] ( http://dienekes.blogspot.com/2013/05/mtdna-from-minoan-crete-hughey-et-al.html ), 
  [ the road to hell is paved with good intentions . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_road_to_hell_is_paved_with_good_intentions ), 
  egypt , greece and cyprus made big ties in defense and energy , they are an eu ally since last year, 
  greece has the best overall relations with russia for a country in the eu by far ( germany being second ) as far as greece-russian alliance i consider the pipeline to be putin 's attempt at swaying greece , turkey , serbia , hungary to russian sphere . 
  pretty much confirms the russian-turkish alliance/partnership , pretty shocking honestly since i thought it would never happen due to russia 's and turkey 's opposing stances on syria . 
  but with the turk-stream ( russian pipeline that will bypass ukraine ) coming this year and greek stream  tesla stream ( serbia )  hungary in 2017 it looks putin is making some power-moves and one step ahead of us so far ( as long as assad/rebel ukraine stays in power at least ), 
  true , but the mass migration is escalating , its hard to say at when it will cap . 
  4-6 million refugees per year is not impossible in the near future if eu keeps the current policy . 
  no , just starting to gain steam so it will be interesting, 
  [ only if we can bring back this flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/state_flag_of_the_kingdom_of_greece_\\ ( 1833-1862 \\ ) . png ) , it would be worth it alone, 
  none of these `` migrants '' want or will stay in greece regardless , this is a eu problem not a greek problem . 
  you really think these islamic ` migrants ' want to stay in a country with 30 % unemployment , where pork on a stick ( gyro ) is within sight everywhere you look and mosques are banned ? 
  i bet orban thinks its easy as putting a gate up `` we did it why cant they ! '' . 
  anyway , i am not against it , but he has to be more careful his words are not seen as aggressive in such a high-stakes issue . 
  grexit was # 1 for a while , i enjoyed the attention . 
  can you edit the title ? 
  the [ eastern med pipeline ] ( http://www.thecypriotpuzzle.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/new-gas-map-europe1.jpg ) has been in the works for years but stalled recently after only finding 4 tcf in aphrodite field . 
  now with the 30 tcf find from egypt and potentially cyprus , eu can fully declare independence from russian gas if needed . 
  syriza implemented the bail-out which was not a very populist move , and the 50 billion euro privatization fund . 
  it is hard to say that , syriza before all the extreme radicals left like lafazanis/konstantinopoulou/varoufakis were certainly more concerned about their ` image ' than anything about the country . 
  syriza is effectively the `` tsipras party '' now for the 1st time , i think he deserves a fair chance to lead with his own party and see how it goes , he did pretty well before considering the party was full of megalomaniac egoist radicals . 
  greece do what exactly ? 
  they are not our problem . 
  this is an eu problem not a greek problem , you should understand that . 
  it is not our problem , you think greece will keep these `` refugees '' ? 
  even if you tried to force them to stay they would rather die trying to get out then stay . 
  the only real help greece could use would be a unified eu coast guard force to bring them to a neutral location in the med sea . 
  most of them arent rescued , you are thinking of libya crossing .
