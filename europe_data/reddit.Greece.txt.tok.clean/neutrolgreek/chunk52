  they all land on lesbos/kos/etc shores and go from there , have you not seen the video of greek coast guard piercing a refugee float ? 
  you have no clue what the fuck you are talking about , as far as setting them free . 
  greece can not keep them in camps due to human rights and most of these people have enough money to get out of greece . 
  not really , wars have started for less and this situation seems to be escalating daily . 
  we are heading to the break-up of the eu within the next few months/years . 
  well as far as i see it , this is n't about pettiness which is usually a term reserved for things like sports or video games , but national security and survival . 
  eventually people like you will understand that this `` refugee '' ( lol ) crisis is a threat to the survival of europe , nothing about wanting to survive it petty . 
  if they have a eu passport , these people would rather beg on the streets in berlin than work in greece or receive non-existant benefits , and that does not even put into factor the 30 % un-employment . 
  these `` migrants '' are here for money and they know where the best supply of cash is , and it is not greece . 
  the culture here is to foreign for them also which is a massive factor , mosques are illegal and there is pork on a stick ( gyro ) everywhere you look . 
  they have no future in greece or anywhere else in balkans , that is just how reality is . 
  putting stipulations on a greek passport like you said , such as no benefits or any other altered conditions would void shengen . 
  meaning , greece would immediately exit the shengen area on its own , not be forced out or voted out . 
  this would be the best thing to ever happen to greece , so i hope it is done soon . 
  shengen is a net loss to greece , causing massive brain drain to germany and uk . 
  only 15 % of greek vacationers leave greece for vacation so that is a moot point . 
  shengen needs to be removed immediately , and i really really hope germany puills the trigger on this when in your `` theory '' , germany alters greek passport rules . 
  and like i said in my previous post , when/if greece leaves the shengen , there is no `` dublin regulations '' any longer . 
  and the most important point of all . 
  these people do not want to stay in greece , mosques are illegal in greece , the culture is agressive to them and there is 30 % un-employment . 
  these `` migrants '' are coming to germany , and it does not matter what greece does either way . 
  if you void one passport then shengen is effectively dead , trust me when i say . 
  you definitely do not want to open that genie either . 
  once shengen is dead and hopefully soon , germany will not be able to send anyone back , greece would just become another stepping stone to germany instead of an `` eu border '' . 
  in your theoretical `` analysis ' , germany making a greek passport void , would also void shengen at the same time . 
  why would those `` newly minted greeks '' come back ? 
  you can not deport them back at that point . 
  you can try but it wo n't work , these people have no future in greece and they know it . 
  if you send them back they will attempt to re-enter , or they will simply be given a eu passport . 
  you have no idea of the tools at greece 's disposal in this matter , this is not some monetary negotation where germany had all the power like we saw this summer , there is no sympathy for playing `` good '' here . 
  if you send them back to greece , within a few days/weeks they will have a shiny new eu passport making them eu/german citizens and a nice shiny train ticket to germany . 
  you invited them , you keep them , like it or not , this is not some financial negotiation , you have no power to bully greece in this and you will understand this soon enough . 
  they will be sent back immedeiately . 
  you do n't get to invite everyone into europe and then a week later back-track , and want to send them to greece or italy . 
  you have no idea of the pandoras box that is about to open . 
  greece can not print money but we can print eu passports , you are not going to threaten anyone with this . 
  i love how germany invites half the middle east into europe and then a week later after the news spread into thesep [ laces and millions are marching they tracked back . 
  to late , if you think greece is going to suffer for your `` dublin regulations '' , you will understand how quickly shit will hit the fan when every `` migrant '' sent back is given a eu passport and a train ticket back to germany . 
  and please , threaten us with removal from shengen , i 'd like to have a laugh . 
  did you seriously suggest pomaks are mistreated ? 
  any really , i recommend just trying a few out in your local area and find what you like, 
  olive oil is the single most used item in the kitchen in greece . 
  90 % of greek olive oil is organic produced so the quality is high . 
  shia iranians are known for their civilized behavior which can not be said for all migrants , as you can see in this [ street battle between syrians and afghanis in lesvos ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzzy8awajuk ), 
  yet , greece is # 1 smoker with lowest cancer rate . . 
  i have no idea how that happens because it definitely is not amazing healthcare system . 
  it must be the greek honey . 
  it is pandoras box , once its open you can not close it again . 
  i have read reports of edited speeches of merkel saying all are welcome to germany being distributed across africa/middle east . 
  in iraq there is a huge national response to those speeches and millions across the region are planning to come , and they do not plan on being stopped . 
  most likely uranium , i doubt greece has much better healthcare and [ it has lowest rate in europe ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bayw4wl.jpg ), 
  sad but true i think vangelis , most famous for creating the masterpiece [ blade runner soundtrack ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsczrvtebea ) is more famous outside of greece than within . 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacn_bcj8tq ), 
  those pictures look like syria around 2011 , not a good sign . 
  there wo n't ever be a major powers war with russia , since that would end with 5,000 nukes landing on the earths surface . 
  but poland will most likely be a super-power or close to it by 2100 . 
  usa is putting all its chips on poland and building them up since they are between russia and germany whom usa considers threats . 
  just bantz, 
  way way more complex than that . 
  there are hundreds of thousands of sunni 's in damascus who support assad since they want a secular leader . 
  yes there were tensions leading up the war between sunnis/alawites but the trigger that brought it out of control was the drought which ruined the crop season for hundreds of thousands of sunni farmers , most of them moved into damascus and tensions rose rapidly from there . 
  i was watching the protest videos as it happened in the weeks leading up to the war . 
  both sides were using viiolence very early on . 
  there are videos you can find on liveleak from the protests of the `` protesters '' using small handguns against riot police , a few dead police/rioters and a few suicide bombings later the violence escalated rapidly . 
  the protesters form day 1 were being funded by wahhabis and were being armed by them . 
  saudi arabia thought assad would fall in a matter of weeks/months and had the support of britain/france to escalate the situation which they did . 
  saudi 's did not expect for assad to get such strong backing from russia since they thought it would be like gadaffi whom putin abandoned . 
  such is life, 
   greece will play spain or poland . 
  oh well , had a good tourny so far so no shame to lose to spain , again , like every single tournament the last 10 years . 
  til, 
  i do n't think most people know how much ww2 history is part of national pride in greece . 
  because the ride never ends, 
  nobody cares , can we just have one thread that is n't a shit-storm please . 
  [ was this de-listing and ban fair ? , a lot of people do not think so ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3juo66/woman_from_lesbos_talking_about_how_the_migration/?submit_url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3fv%3dc8x9oay_mo8&amp;already_submitted=true&amp;submit_title=test ), 
  the mod history was over the month of august, 
   the great migration looks like a permanent phenomenon . 
  the syrian civil war can easily be considered the first major water war . 
  what happened was that hundreds of thousands of farmers lost their crop season due to a drought , then they all moved into the urban areas where tensions rose , protests happened , small skirmshes turned into large ambushes and now we have the syria of today . 
  fun fact : [ 14 of the top 30 countries on earth facing massive water shortage by 2040 are in the middle east ] ( http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-nations-that-will-be-hardest-hit-by-water-shortages-by-2040 ) syrian migration is nothing compared to what will happen soon , we are facing the biggest migration into europe since the end of the last ice age over the next century .

  no clue , hopefully we do n't get banned for asking but i thought i needed to ask , since i have no idea why it happened . 
  somebody tried posting these interviews with lesbos residents here yesterday and they were banned . 
  please do not ban me for posting these , i can remove them if necessary .

  no reasons given for delisting and ban . 
  honest question to mods , why was the user banned ? 
  technically the climate wars have already begun . 
  syrian civil war started when the poor sunni farmers outside of damascus lost a years crop to drought . 
  after mass protests about it there was small skirmshes between police and rioters , which within a week became handgun battles and then a month later became assault rifle ambushes and then it just snowballed from there . 
  [ that reminds me of this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifemw_6a-tg ), 
  he needs to be treated like a savior by these `` migrants '' to fill up some void in his life or other mental illness . 
  cleaning trash is something that requires hard work with no praise so of course he does not accept this . 
  he needs to be treated like jesus coming down to earth !, 
  nothing else will do .

  14 of the top 20 countries on earth facing water shortages in 2040 are in the middle east . 
  nigeria with a soon to be population of 1 billion is facing a massive isis guerilla war ( boko haram pledged to isis few months ago ) , all of west africa will be fleeing over the next 1-2 decades .
