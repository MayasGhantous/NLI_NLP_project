  if nothing is done , it is not hard to imagine 5-10 million people attempting to illegally enter europe every year by 2030 . 
  i have never heard that , each region in greece , hundreds of them had their own unique customs , rituals , gods , etc. 
  there was no such thing as a region wide hellenic culture , but each city-state had their own style of hellenism , i really do n't think mixing water and wine played any role , but i can see why an athenian democrat would view makedon monarchy system as barbaric , the same way many europeans today view dictators as barbaric today . 
  after alexander died , makedon was the center of the hellenic world for 2-3 centuries until the four makedon-rome wars which took place over a span of 100 years and saw a united hellenic military lead by makedon against rome until their loss in the fourth war . 
  no greeks did not , athenians possibly did , atleast one of the highest ranking leaders of the athenian democracy during a period of war between makedon and athens . 
  makedon during this time was using a monarchy system which would have been viewed as barbaric to the democratic athenians . 
  one thing that is certain though is that makedons viewed themselves as greek and spread the culture all the way to afghanistan , that much is known . 
  i do n't think most people care about the name , but the actions of their government . 
  like when their politicians keep doing nationalist speeches in front of maps which show half of greece as part of their country . 
  at least for me i could not care less about the name , i think rom ( republic of macedonia ) is a fair middle-ground , or something like northern/upper macedonia is fine . 
  but their politicians keep doing crazy shit which angers people . 
  having their [ politicians do speeches ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/200298/article/ekathimerini/news/athens-reacts-after-fyrom-deputy-speaker-pictured-in-front-of-irredentist-map ) in front of altered maps which show half of greek territory as part of their country , or when [ the vice president climbs mount olympus to plant their flag on the top ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/163229/article/ekathimerini/news/fyrom-official-raises-vergina-sun-flag-on-mount-olympus-peak ) . 
  i am not `` butt-hurt '' about the name , but these stupid actions which show aggressive attitude . 
  nigeria 's population will reach 1 billion within a few decades , so this is for those who think that eventually refugee numbers will slide down any time soon . 
  greece and portugal are building type 214 submarines now , so it could be cheaper to get those . 
  i am not going to argue much but all i will say is that both sides are stupid on this , do n't just blame greece . 
  [ last month when a fyrom politician ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/200298/article/ekathimerini/news/athens-reacts-after-fyrom-deputy-speaker-pictured-in-front-of-irredentist-map ) did a speech in front of a map which showed territory of greece all the way to central greece as part of fyrom nobody said anything here . 
  so when their politicians think it is a good idea to claim land of greece , nobody says anything . 
  . but this case of greece being stupid is huge news ? 
  at least say that both sides are being idiots instead of just greece if you want to be fair . 
  i think it was aristotle who said olive oil was `` liquid gold '' , you could be on to something . 
  le conspiracy meme you are clueless to isis/aq/taliban plans , they have been working on this plan for as far as we know at least a decade . 
  this is known due to a little known but prophetic interview given in 2005 by spiegel with an aq leader who basically laid out the entire plan in the interview . 
  he said that aq would organize the civil war in syria , take control of iraq and even said that the `` islamic state '' group would be operational in 2012/2013 . 
  all this predicted in 2005 . 
  he also said that the full scale `` infidel vs believer '' war would begin in 2016 . 
  i personally think they will push back this planned war to 2020-2030 since everything is going much better than they expected . 
  i doubt aq and now isis will start the war now when the flood gates are open , they will try to push as many jihadis and potential jihadis into europe as possible before they give the order . 
  i would love to see your face when the full scale war begins , initiated by jihadis in europe . 
  i wonder what you will say then . 
  from 2005 interview with aq leadership http://www.spiegel.de/international/the-future-of-terrorism-what-al-qaida-really-wants-a-369448.html `` the third phase this is described as `` arising and standing up '' and should last from 2007 to 2010 . 
  ** `` there will be a focus on syria , '' ** prophesies hussein , based on what his sources told him . 
  the fighting cadres are supposedly already prepared and some are in iraq . 
  the fourth phase between 2010 and 2013 , hussein writes that al-qaida will aim to bring about the collapse of the hated arabic governments . 
  the estimate is that `` the creeping loss of the regimes ' power will lead to a steady growth in strength within al-qaida . '', 
  the fifth phase this will be the point at which an ** islamic state ** , or caliphate , can be declared . 
  the plan is that by this time , between 2013 and 2016 , western influence in the islamic world will be so reduced and israel weakened so much , that resistance will not be feared . 
  al-qaida hopes that by then the ** islamic state ** will be able to bring about a new world order . 
  the sixth phase hussein believes that ** from 2016 onwards there will a period of `` total confrontation . 
  '' ** as soon as the caliphate has been declared the `` islamic army '' it will instigate the `` fight between the believers and the non-believers '' which has so often been predicted by osama bin laden . '', 
  once terrorist attacks become a daily occurrence in a few years through-out europe i hope the people pushing for these `` migrants '' to come will pay the price . 
  this is nothing less than a jihadi invasion of europe . 
  madrid has also passed a series of draconian laws recently in which i assume is a preparation for the chaos if this vote happens . 
  it is hard to say what madrid will do , but i do not think they will let catalan go peacefully . 
  olive oil count ? 
  plot twist : merkel and putin are twins separated at birth , raised to form the greatest empire known to man . 
  i do n't know why people are getting angry now , this is only a new string to the current nord stream pipeline , not a completely new pipeline . 
  that was the south stream pipeline that has been `` officially '' cancelled for a long while now . 
  there is the turkish stream  greek stream  rom  tesla stream ( official name for serb pipeline ) that is still in the works right now . 
  greek and russian officials have been meeting a lot lately to continue this pipeline so i do think it will still eventually happen . 
  russia wants this pipeline to compete with the azerbaijan tanap/tap pipeline system . 
  they are dying man, 
  actions are being taken now since there is a new government but associated with nd/pasok who did not investigate this, 
  the problem is that this would create enclaves which in the future could turn into their own mini-nations , it has happened so many times before in the balkans that there is even a word for it , balkanization . 
  100,000 today , 1 million tomorrow , 10 million in future, 
  i actually saw an upvoted comment the other day on this subreddit how eu is fascist because illegals are dying on the boat trips and that there should be direct flights from africa/middle east for all refugees . 
  no direct flights = nazi, 
  eu is not doing enough , 1-2 million illegals being welcomed is simply not good enough . 
  i think eu should be taking in 3-5 million a year otherwise eu is nazi . 
  [ `` greece has the potential to be the organic grove of europe , '' ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-20/greek-olive-oil-exports-boom-as-italy-spain-s-prices-soar ) says kefalogiannis . 
  i do n't know the truth about how it could be done . . but i do know this , uk/usa need to stop fucking handing out atgm ( anti-tank ) equipment and training like candy out to syrian islamists . 
  there are now thousands of very highly trained and experienced atgm operators in syria due to us/uk training programs , the definition of insanity . 
  dark ages greece is the most mysterious time period for me , nothing is known of it , except most assume it was initially caused by the santorini volcano which is most likely true . 
  i like to imagine that during the dark ages after the volcano it was like a mad max version of minoan greece , lots of crazy rituals and religious cults scattered everywhere . 
  chinese markets are not crashing , they are adjusting due to markets booming to much over the last few years . 
  even after this `` crash '' , chinese companies are still double their worth compared to last year . 
  right now market players are seeing how low they can take chinese market down before putting big money on going long and then making money as chinese markets rise up again after the `` crash '' . 
  it could have just been old/bad ice cream or something like that , its happened to me before . 
  i do n't understand why they are already saying with confidence it was intentional poisoning before an investigation happens . 
   ban all derivatives . 
  a little to late for that now , deutsche bank alone has 54 trillion euros worth of derivatives on their books alone , yes 54 trillion with a t . the entire world would have to go through an economic dark-ages of a few decades to restart the economy if derivatives were banned . 
  the uk played a massive role in destabilizing the middle east and north africa , i consider uk 's foreign policy of `` not giving a fuck '' to be the primary cause of this crisis . 
  '' [ according to former french foreign minister roland dumas ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2013/aug/30/syria-chemical-attack-war-intervention-oil-gas-energy-pipelines ) , britain had planned covert action in syria as early as 2009 : ** `` i was in england two years before the violence in syria on other business '' , he told french television : '' ** i met with top british officials , who confessed to me that they were preparing something in syria . 
  this was in britain not in america . 
  britain was preparing gunmen to invade syria . '', 
  i only think its depraved when people go nude on non-nudist beaches . 
  like when i go to a nice beach and then i see some weird old guy get completely naked to change into his little man-bikini , not cool man . 
  homosex only allowed on mykonos, 
  there is a new division of sdoe that targets only wealthy tax evasion and crime called [ kefomep ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/07/23/greek-tax-office-freezes-410-doctors-suspicious-accounts/ ) , sdoe primarily targets tourism places and other small/medium sized businesses and the new kefomep division targets the wealthy class . 
  2nd was just as good imo , it really explains the full story and its done well . 
  [ rec ], 
  mainly because they are doing what the previous governments refused to `` over 16,000 checks were carried out by the government 's financial and economic crime unit ( sdoe ) on businesses between july 27 and august 16 . '', 
  i do n't think new democracy/pasok performed 16,000 checks in the last decade , let alone 3 weeks . 
  nice dodging of my question , my point is that nobody gets sent back to any african country , you just lied to everyone here which you have been doing for a long time to further promote this invasion that is happening . 
  none of them get deported back to libya , do you have a source that says otherwise ? 
  he is most well known i think for making the genius move of changing law to not allow home mortgages to be in swiss currency , only a few months before swiss currency removed its peg from the euro . 
  he saved many of his citizens from complete bankruptcy . 
  nothing is more frightening then when i pass a motorcycle rent store and see tourists who have obviously never riden a motorcycle before take one , i like to call them kamikazes . 
  syrians are just the beginning , the entire middle east is entering a 100 + years war for religious supremacy between shia and sunni . 
  this war is already spreading to sub-saharan africa like wild-fire . 
  africa 's population will reach in the billions within a generation , nigeria alone will have a population of 1 billion + and they are in the middle of a islamic guerilla war which will see many of them flee the country . 
  what is happening now will exponentially grow and if nothing is done europe will be facing 2-3 million illegal immigrants per year within the next 10-20 years . 
  it is surely a culture , it is widespread use by young and adults , you have great bike lanes that are safe and modern . 
  in greece nobody rides a bike really because there is no bike lanes , sometimes i see professional cyclists training for some competition , but thats it . 
  censoring free speech in containment threads that get updated once a week almost destroyed this subreddit . 
  the more people like you try to censor any talk on immigration the more extreme people will get . 
  transylvania is somewhere i want visit soon , i love the history of the place, 
  for plastic surgery , athens is very popular , you can find plastic surgery/vacation packages for very cheap . 
  for dentist work i think republic of macedonia is best and very cheap , i have family that went there for dentist work . 
  yup , anyone remember the tons of upvoted comments which said that eu invading greece is a good idea if they threaten to print euros ?
