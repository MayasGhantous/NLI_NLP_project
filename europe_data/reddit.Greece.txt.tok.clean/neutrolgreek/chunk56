  the basij may best be known for their employment human wave attacks which cleared minefields or draw the enemy 's fire . 
  [ 13 ] it is estimated that tens of thousands were killed in the process . 
  some reports have the basiji marching into battle marking their expected entry to heaven by wearing plastic `` keys to paradise '' around their necks '' it was in a documentary i have seen, 
  look in that link i posted, 
  [ iraqi army was defeated by an iran which used teenage boys holding the quran and no gun straight into battle to clear minefields ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basij ), 
  apparently we are the bad guys with fyrom , but nobody notices the crazy shit they do . 
  [ just a few days ago ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/200298/article/ekathimerini/news/athens-reacts-after-fyrom-deputy-speaker-pictured-in-front-of-irredentist-map ) one of their ministers in government did a speech with a map behind him which included hundreds of miles of greek territory , all the way through central greece . 
  balkans is at the same time the best place on earth and the worst place on earth, 
  there was no such thing as the iraqi army , ever . 
  it was just an illusion , half of the military fled the moment usa boots were on the ground and the other half fled the next day . 
  iraq is a country with dozens of ethnic tribes , people are loyal to their tribes not to `` iraq '' . 
  the kurds are far different , they are extremely motivated soldiers with a very hardcore martyr mentality , not even closely comparible to iraq .

  my point is that you said ethnic cypriots vs greeks . 
  you made it sound like there is an `` ethnic cypriot population '' that has their own unique language and culture/etc . 
  the ethnic cypriots are greek , now if you want to debate that northern cypriots are ethnic cypriots is another discussion . 
  is the 35 % of estonian population that is russian ethnicity , estonian or russian ? 
  ethnic cypriots vs greeks . 
  what ? 
  you realize that ethnic cypriots are greek right ? 
  greece , egypt , cyprus and israel just formed a major mediterranean alliance this year in economy , energy , military and security , so that is why tsipras is visiting . 
  3.75 % is not that bad considering the circumstances, 
  i think a lot of people hate varoufakis since he is very cocky and also likes to speak like he is in a position of power , which greece is not at the moment . 
  the one thing though is that german audiences who see him speak live usually cheer for him , but a major problem is that many of his words get taken out of context and used to distort his image . 
  on a side note , [ i saw this picture of varoufakis today ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/200250/article/ekathimerini/news/polices-cyber-crime-unit-to-investigate-varoufakis-plan ) . 
  that shirt is absolutely ridiculous , his fashion sense is bizarre . 
  i would think people here would love him since he is the most pro-federal/super-state eu politician in european politics . 
  hes spent the last 5 years lobbying for a eu super-state which most of this board seems to want,

  varoufakis has always said he wants a european super-state with germany as its head , so you make no sense there . 
  i think varoufakis just really dislikes shauble and vice versa . 
   syriza government are complete puppets of the kremlin if this was the case then tsipras and lafazanis would be best friends right now since that is what lafazanis wants . 
  lafazanis has been internally campaigning within syriza for return to drachma and geo-political shift to russia which tsipras has slapped down and now they are at political war with each other . 
  tsipras just said yesterday that lafazanis left platform infiltrated syriza which is openly a pro-european party to push their pro-russian rhetoric . 
  considering he used the terms `` infiltrated '' there is not really much chance of syriza going to russia . 
  [ this is the pipeline that may be built in near future ] ( http://media.worldbulletin.net/news/2014/06/03/east-mediterranean-pipeline-cyprus-greece.jpg ) , estimated cost between 10-15 billion euros for completion . 
  does anyone know of any accurate timetables to when the saudi oil will run out ? 
   most powerful woman of the balkans [ technically zoe is a woman ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/files/zoi-konstantopoulou2.jpg ) , she is leader of greek parliament right now, 
  the only reason european sub exists is due to censorship here . 
  that is fucked up, 
  instead of a megathread , why not just tag immigration related posts so people can filter them out if they dislike that information ? 
  [ that is a major focus according to ministers also ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/07/22/greek-deputy-minister-of-state-fighting-corruption-will-be-number-one-priority/ ), 
  both of course, 
  the reason is that greedy bastard refuses to share, 
  i would much prefer it in the style of the odd couple, 
  tsipras is the prime minister , the president is a completely different role that is elected by parliament vote . 
  varoufakis would never run for prime minister against tsipras since he has 0 % chance of winning , but i could see him trying to persuade the parliament to make him president . 
  interesting , did you want to go to kavos more or less after watching it ? 
  i feel like these documentaries and this facebook page are only increasing the infamy of kavos , which is great imo . 
  all these young brits who go to greece and go crazy will eventually become family men/women who will eventually go to quiter places in greece as they grow older . 
  a greek person did n't start this blog , it is another tourist or maybe expat , not sure which . 
  [ what happens in kavos ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_qurqrd6aw ) is a documentary on this my favorite quote from op article `` it 's all too much : this man is pictured after giving up in his attempts to climb a testing six concrete steps '', 
  yes , pretty much . 
  balkans is the best place on earth but also the worst . 
  greece would also pay the eurotax , that is the point . 
  i see this as the 1st step towards a federal eu , i have no issues with greek government having less power as long as their is more overall stability in the eurozone as a whole . 
  greece would be able to flourish under such a system since there would be less risk of a crisis . 
  one of the biggest hurdles previously was that each agency in greece would require paperwork and information for each person separately , one of the reforms is data sharing of individuals information between agencies to lessen bureaucracy . 
  so instead of requiring tons of paperwork they can just access info digitally . 
  reducing paperwork and bureaucracy is definitely a major area of focus for reforms . 
  have n't seen u here in a while : o, 
  the best side effect of this is that greek pilots are the most drilled and experienced air force next to uk and france . 
  they have nearly daily violations of air space which require swift response and also mock dogfighting happens during these chases . 
  it is the main reason why greece , israel and usa train together a few times a year as they are nearly equal in skill level . 
  greece just offered nato a prime location in greek islands to build a massive new nato headquarters/east med base in response to these air violations . 
  fuck yes please if this happens , greece might actually survive and possibly even flourish under such a system . 
  greece can offer 1 free punch to varoufakis face for schauble as compensation . 
  tossing grenades at each other, 
  greece already implemented dozens of major reforms the last 2 weeks . 
  pension age now 67 , vat 23 % on islands , new civil law ( which is a major work ) and a few others . 
  and that is just to begin negotiations for next set of reforms . 
  syriza is the first party in greece which has a forward thinking mindset and not a backwards greek civil-war ( post ww2 ) mindset and mafia style network . 
  yes a waiter or car rental service will never be as productive as a mercedes engineer , but that does not mean they do not work hard and long hours . 
  i am not saying it is difficult work , its not . 
  . but it is hard to work very long hours . 
  i do n't think you understand , the money `` from others '' is already going there , but not to help growth , but to pay back old debts some of them 40-50 + years old . 
  varoufakis `` decentralized europeanization '' plan which he has been lobbying for years is that instead of bailouts which causes tensions , that there is a debt management institution for the eu and surplus countries invest 2-3 % of their surplus into investment programs in deficit countries to promote growth . 
  basically a growth investment cycle so if one surplus country has a bad few years and goes into deficit than they will be given tons of money in investment to help growth . 
  i ca n't even imagine the amount of brainwashing that goes on in raqqa and other isis strongholds , it is like a slice of 2,000 bc over there . 
  there needs to be a zero tolerance policy regarding illegals otherwise it will never end and in fact exponentially grow every single year like it has been the last decade . 
  if you take 100 % then nobody will want to participate in any form, 
  it is well known that isis ultimate goal according to internal documents is to initiate some kind of `` end war '' at some point over the next 50-60 years , i read somewhere that they believe their holy war will culminate into a final war some time around 2060-2070 's . 
  these people are very very long term thinkers and strategist . 
  provoking turkey today makes no sense but there must be some kind of long-term strategy where this pans out into their goal of that apocalypse war in 50-60 years . 
   although the greek elite would n't make such a deal when they know they can get away with it like they 've been doing up until now . 
  [ a few weeks ago ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/06/23/arrest-warrant-against-greek-businessman-for-lagarde-list/ ) , metaxas which is the most famous and largest liquor producer in greece was arrested for tax evasion and faces life in prison . 
  he ignored government notices to open his accounts for government to check and to pay back old taxes he had dodged . 
  there is most certainly government intervention into such a deal . 
  greece and iran just had a huge bilateral trading/future goals meeting around 1-2 months ago in tehran . 
  greece is positioning itself to be the main ally for iran within the eu and will lobby on iran 's behalf and in exchange iran will use greece as the main entry point for their oil and gas into the eu , iran has the second largest reserves of natural gas on earth next to russia . 
  aegean is the main domestic airline in greece, 
  [ `` the number one priority is for people to understand that this government is not linked to any interest groups , that we are not the people of the interests , and that we can therefore crack down on corruption without any qualms , '' ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/07/22/greek-deputy-minister-of-state-fighting-corruption-will-be-number-one-priority/ ) quick said . 
  by `` interests '' he means shipping , media , real estate , etc oligarchs that had complete and total control of previous governments for decades . 
   the deputy minister said the government was also ready to start checking thousands of bank deposits abroad , in switzerland and elsewhere , in order to discover money that had not been declared . 
   `` whoever has not declared [ their deposits ] will be fined 40 percent . 
  whoever declares them will pay 21 percent to be cleared . 
  in this way we do not sanctify tax evasion but only locate the money and , of course , bring in revenues , '' quick said .

  christianity is a wholly european culture , where do you think the whole walking on water , turning water to wine , resurrection after 3 days came from ? 
  those are all core stories from greek mythology that was adopted by early greek and roman christians .
