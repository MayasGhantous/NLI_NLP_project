  fair enough , but that is why reforms are important . 
  greece raised it to 23 % last week as part of reform package . 
   they worry about basic needs while greeks worry about not being able to buy angry bird games with capital control that makes no sense . 
  you realize that greece has 60 % youth unemployment correct ? 
  i do n't think anybody cares about angry birds . 
  regardless overall i agree which is why i hope the structural reforms being implemented that were stalled by previous governments can have a good long-term effect . 
  on your last point , before 2011 greece was not in-debted to european countries like is currently the situation , only to private banks that over-lended to greece . 
  the best option would have been to default then . 
  uk - [ dead man 's shoes ] ( http://cinema.solarmovie.is/link/play/4868032/ ) ( full movie link , i will delete if not ok ) and spain - [ \\ [ rec \\ ] ] ( http://cinema.solarmovie.is/link/play/3837938/ ) , my favorite horror film, 
  i am not debating that greek economy was sustainable pre-depression , it was n't and it will take decades to repair the damage made from previous governments . 
  but my only point was that military spending was at times 10-15 % of gdp during the 80 's when debt started to spiral out of control . 
  it is only since 2008 that military spending went to 2-3 % to match nato standard . 
  the thing is that most of that money did not go to `` maintain a lifestyle '' , greek government debt is the issue , not private/home debt which is very low compared to most european countries . 
  the fact that greece spent 400-500 billion euros on military since the cyprus invasion did more to contribute to the crisis than anyone `` maintaining a lifestyle '', 
   [ also why ca n't people take a joke ? 
  ] ( https://blueollie.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/triggered.jpg?w=320&amp;h=371 ), 
  i remember that one , it was pretty funny at the stupidity of that guy . 
  newest scandal in greece is of one of the hard-left people in syriza who refuses to sign the bailout and is criticizing tsipras for giving up , and thinks going back to drachma/iou 's is a great idea . 
  meanwhile her mother coincidentally took out 200,000 euros of cash from the bank 24 hours before banks were closed for capital controls . 
  the only group within syriza you could consider `` neo-commies '' is the far left platform , one of the many splinter groups within syriza and headed by lafazanis . 
  there is currently a lot of drama in greece because tsipras and lafazanis are at political war because lafazanis refuses to sign the bailout agreement and wants to instead do the russia plan . 
  they are not competitors though , they are cheating the system . 
  this is why i do n't believe this . 
  10 billion wouldnt even be close enough , according to tsipras there is 22 billion in currency reserves in greece which was not enough for a return to drachma . 
  tsipras has openly said that the reason the switch was not made is due to insufficient currency reserves of only 22 billion , an additional 10 billion would not solve much . 
  lindos is amazing , one of the best beaches in greece, 
  a random graph does n't represent the opinions of 11-12 million individuals . 
   they just want other to keep giving them more money while they continue to not reform . 
  except greece did and is reforming , greece was ranked # 1 in reform implementation between 2007-2014 by oecd and there are countless statements by imf praising greek reform efforts the last few years . 
  samaras failed at reforming the structural problems with greece , he was great at cost-cutting reforms but without structural reforms the cost-cutting ones went to waste . 
  this week alone greece has changed pension age to 67 , increased vat to 23 % for islands and a bunch of others . 
  and next week there are a dozen other major reforms that will be pushed through parliament . 
  these are the structural reforms previous governments stalled on, 
  good one , i would like to see a similar drawing with shaeuble having varoufakis in a rear chokehold , [ like this ] ( http://f.tqn.com/y/martialarts/1/5/k/-/-/-/bjj_rear_naked_choke_5.jpg ), 
  i would assume they are easily renewed as long as you dont break any environmental laws . 
  you do n't buy the islands , they are 10 year leases with very strict environmental laws and annual government check-ups . 
  [ warren buffet ] ( http://sputniknews.com/europe/20150719/1024797417.html ) also purchased an island this week and there is a rumor that [ angelina jolie and brad pitt ] ( http://www.inquisitr.com/2163787/brad-pitt-and-angelina-jolie-to-buy-their-own-private-greek-island/ ) will purchase one this summer also . 
  there are 6-7 ,000 islands in greece , 200 of them are inhabited . 
  just to be clear these islands are not purchased like a car or house but they are long-term 10 year leases . 
  they must strictly follow environmental laws and they can be kicked out of the island for pollution or breaking other laws . 
  there are 6-7 ,000 islands in greece , around 200 are inhabited . 
  it would be interesting to see all these tiny uninhabited ones become ultra-wealthy private islands for celebrities and other international elites . 
  i do n't think by any standard really , syriza 's end goal is `` social justice '' not `` commie socialism '' . 
  they were elected due to their hard-line stance on wealthy oligarchs and greek elites which have been siphoning all the wealth of greece to the top . 
  this does not mean they want to take all that wealth away from the oligarchs like in communism , just make them pay their fair share . 
  syriza is not even close to commie , kke is pro commie and pro stalin, 
  for some reason , i picture you being 100 % serious, 
  i died a little inside just thinking of it, 
  there was a known psy-ops operation to directly interfere with the referendum polling , that is if you believe the new democracy secret sheet stating this that was `` leaked '' , and i do believe it was real . 
  i do n't think there is any incentive left for new democracy to continue their polling manipulation , especially since the crook samaras has left office . 
  the dispute , and it is a very minor dispute will take time to solve but there at least is steps being taken . 
  [ greek foreign minister visited rom for first time in 11 years ] ( http://www.balkaneu.com/fyrom-greece-agree-building-trust-countries/ ) 2 months ago and are working with rom government to create a long-term `` trust-building '' initiative . 
  as far as the name , i think rom/republic of macedonia is fine , makes it sound like rome . 
   the two ministers said that they signed a document that contains 12 points with the aim of building up trust . 
  the measures that will be taken and implemented by the two countries include the domain of education , culture , trade , transport , energy laws , tourism and judicial system . 
  these are initial measures , while kotsias and poposki agreed on other measures of cooperation too . 
   syriza came in and stopped everything debt related tsipras has paid 7 billion euros in debt re-payments while in office . 
  are you referring to something else ? 
  this is the most likely answer lots of alcohol and cocaine mixed with testosterone with a protest nearby will usually lead to something like this . 
  this happens on average around 20-30 times a week , so not really news . 
  lets put it this way , if every single person without a helmet got fined , greece would not need any bailouts . 
  in tsipras words they will remain united `` so the left is not over-thrown ( in greece ) '' , that was his last remark on his closing speech . 
  at least be witty, 
   because iran is coming back to the market ? 
  and they are currently negotiating to pipe that oil through greece , so win-win either way . 
  july 14 - [ greek , french and italian partnership submit bids for 20 hydrocarbon plots in ionian sea + crete ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/199535/article/ekathimerini/business/three-bids-tabled-for-hydrocarbon-permits ) [ katakolo block has between 3-5 million barrels of oil ] ( http://www.trajanresources.com/files/9114/2469/5799/greece_offshore_katakolon_block.jpg ), 
  the main reform i want from troika is just more fucking transparency , allow greek citizens to be updated on greece 's current situation with up to date information on reform implementation and accurate detailed future projections .

   within a few years but is rather designed for 30 years yes , i read this too yesterday . 
  most people are having issues because they think it will 50bn sold off in 4 years . 
  it is a 30-40 year plan and greece needs to kick-start this after previous governments stalled to do anything on privitizations . 
  [ the hellinkon project ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zn-3unactc ) alone has been stalled for a decade and the investors were getting angry . 
  this project alone will create 1-2 % of greek gdp and will create 50,000 jobs . 
  agreed , there is a difference between selling off a water and energy company which the new owners would only raise prices and add no value to selling piraeus port to cosco who have already invested 300-400 million euros and plan to invest billions when they bid for majority stake in october . 
  they are already discussing plans to createa a modern ship repair facility near piraeus to service the thousands of ships going through there . 
  privization that adds no value is bad , privitization that creates billions of euros worth of wealth is good . 
  [ tsipras prepared to replace dissident cabinet members ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/07/14/tsipras-prepared-to-replace-dissident-cabinet-members/ ), 
  they do not own majority of piraeus , they want to get majority when the bidding begins in october for piraeus/thessaloniki . 
  cosco will most likely win piraeus [ since it is a national priority for china ] ( http://i.imgur.com/u9mmnwp.jpg ) as a central focus of their `` silk road '' strategy they are building , they have cut their transport delivery time to europe by 3 total days since they started using piraeus . 
  maersk will likely only be able to get thessaloniki , although putin has signaled that it might be a national priority to get thessaloniki since russia wants to use it as their central hub for balkans trade and eventually build a rail-line from thessaloniki up through balkans . 
  tsipras and merkel spent 16 hours straight in a meeting and it finished with a final deal at 6am . 
  it is easy to tell greece to quit when you have nothing to lose,

  do n't generalize 11 million people like they are some borg type machines . 
  do you like when people generalize about romanians ? 
   the night of the living debt that would be a good name for a documentary about last nights events, 
  liquidate would mean to just hand over and have no personal gain whatsoever . 
  50bn of privitization over 30-40 years ( which is the plan ) is fine , it will create jobs and secure investment . 
  this is not a hand over of greek assets with no future benefits , it is the opposite . 
  greece has been stalling privitazation for decades due to corrupt governments , it is time greece acts like other eu countries and embraces privitazations . 
  . ofcourse in water/energy it is more sensitive issue and privitizations in these sectors should only be for 10-20 % not majority stake . 
  if this works out by 2020 , most greeks would be 100 % with going full federal europe . 
  it might hurt now but this could just be the start of something better for everyone . 
  i just do n't think so , tsipras completely eviscerated all political parties with one fell swoop in the no victory , which i think was the main goal . 
  immediately after the no victory his biggest challenger samaras resigned and nd is now a shadow of its former self , alongside pasok on the sidelines and they will never recover , ever . 
  the next day he consolidated all political power with every single party except kke/gd agreeing to follow his orders on any deal . 
  and at the same time , he managed to create a 3 year deal instead of a 6 month temporary deal which would have been more damaging than a grexit or bailout . 
  did you miss out on the fact of the massive reform package greece must implement ? 
  including raising retirement to 67 and cutting pensions ? 
  besides that , i do not know why eu would want uk to participate , seems like an odd decision regardless .
