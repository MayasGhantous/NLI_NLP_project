  also , the fact that greece lost 30 % of its economy following previous reforms was not a sacrifice to you ? 
  hellinkon is indeed in the privatization plans , even the earlier ones before last nights deal . 
  as far as the chinese project , from what i read china wants to create a mini china-town sort of like in other countries . 
  it will have chinese architecture and be focused on housing chinese immigrants and attracting tourism . 
  i am not sure where this project still stands but i assume it is still active . 
  hellinkon is the biggest urban un-developed real estate in europe , and also in a prime location . 
  the plan is to turn it into the central focus of athens tourism . 
  it is forecasted to create 30-50 ,000 jobs and create 1-2 % of greek gdp . 
  it is not for housing , but a major tourism project . 
  that is hard to say , before the referendum the only deal being negotiated was for a 6 month deal which would then lead to a next series of crisis talks . 
  this new deal is for a 3 year program with the end goal of modernizing the greek state in every aspect . 
  the privitization 50bn fund is a bit hard to swallow , but tsipras managed to get it split 3 ways , 25bn goes to debt re-payment , 12.5 bn goes to kick-start investment programs , 12.5 bn goes to recapitalize banks . 
  still not the greatest deal but better than merkels initial plan to make all 50bn go into debt repayment . 
  and the truth is that greece desperately needs to privatize many projects which have been stalled , some for over a decade like the [ hellinkon development project ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zn-3unactc ) , which is expected to bring in 5-10bn of investment money and create 30-50 ,000 jobs . 
  the only red line i have for privitizations is selling majority stakes in energy and water companies , but from what i have read so far the only water/energy deals will be for 10-15 % stakes , not majority . 
  pasok/nd are history , you are correct . 
  it wo n't split . 
  . as much as those far-left idiots like lafazanis are angry right now , they will never ever again gain any sort of political power in their lifetimes if they walk away from tsipras , they will just be seen as a kke-lite idiots . 
  are you fucking kidding me ? 
  bild has ran an anti-greek campaign for years now , the difference is that greek idiots like to bash merkel or shauble , only politicians . 
  while germans bash the common greek because bild filled their head with all sorts of bullshit .

  no we did n't need it , the 1st bailout was illegal and greece should have defaulted in 2010-2011 and went back to the drachma . 
  in that scenario though , a possible contagion with the likely fall of deutsche bank would have occured . 
  greece went bankrupt in 2010-2011 and then were forced to take out the largest loan in human history to pretend it did n't go bankrupt and it was only an issue of liquidity . 
  to save german and french banks , who then swapped their debt onto your shoulders , french and greek . . now we are all fucked . 
  nobody wins , greece did not `` win '' from these bailouts . 
  do you think this is what winning looks like ? 
   reforms do n't need to be done syriza 's entire campaign was based on being hard-line reformers . 
  you have no idea what you are discussing here, 
  you really think greece shutting down the only independent media in greece was a good reform ? 
  that is the only reform if you can even call it that that was actually reveresed . 
  ert was illegally shut down for having opposition views to previous government . 
  they recently opened up and while every single media channel in greece was campaigning for yes vote and not playing tsipras speechs live , ert was showing opposition . 
  i understand why creditors wanted it shut down though . 
  that was when syriza were setting up their `` red lines '' strategy back in february , they have not only agreed to abandon those red lines but far beyond that at this point . 
  the main connections of the greek stream pipeline are the greek-italian pipeline and greek-rom pipeline , it always has been . 
  rom  serbia  hungary  austria is something new , greece-italy connection has been in the planning since the original russia gas proposal to greece in 2007, 
  tsipras has made major effort in this regard imo , the 100 debt installment payment program was made to handle this and there have been a few major arrests like metaxa who is the most famous liquor producer in greece for refusing to sign up to the program . 
  it will take a few years for elites/wealthy and oligarchy to realize that they are not free to do what they like without consequence . 
  who do you think paid the 50 billion euros of taxes ? 
  if the wealthy/elite paid it would raise to 70 billion or more and that is the main issue . 
  what reforms did they roll back ? 
  name a single one . 
  [ besides the fact that oecd ranked greece # 1 in reform implementation between 2007-2014 ] ( http://coppolacomment.blogspot.com/2015/02/reforms-bloody-reforms.html ) , do you have a source which claims otherwise ? 
  the problem was never reform implementation , it was which reforms to do specifically . 
  why do you assume i was blaming them ? 
  it was the greek government who were corrupt and taking bribes . 
  my point was that this current crisis was about more factors than just about taxes like you keep saying in every thread . 
  the main corruption in greek politics happened in arms procurement . 
  a single defense minister alone was found to have stolen 50 million euros in bribes/kickbacks/etc , and that is only the known amount . 
  german , french and american arms dealers were given blank checks by greek governments and in return gave extremely generous bribes . 
  none of this is ever mentioned by eu powers since it would put their own nations in the spotlight for corruption, 
  the same shit every thread , it is not 100 % because of tax you fool . 
  greece collected 50 billion in 2013 and 2014 , which was 6 % lower than eu average as % of gdp . 
  tax evasion in greece is 4 % higher than eu average . 
  neither one was the primary cause of the crisis , it played a big role sure but not the primary cause . 
  the fact that greece payed 500 billion euros to build up the largest modern tank and air-force in europe ( 2,000 tanks +300 modern jets ) among other countless military toys played a much much bigger role in the current state of affairs . 
  federation will never happen because of easily propagandized fools like yourself that can turn your opinion on a moments notice because the glowing rectangle tube told you so . 
  greece is absolutely nothing compared to the real challenges eu is facing in the very near future . 
  and i guarantee you will be foaming from the mouth from other propaganda bullshit you hear during that time also . 
  it is what fools like you do . 
  you realize what you are saying with cold logic is the same cold logic that was applied to germany post-ww1 . 
  do you people not study history outside of ww2 or something ? 
  the turkish stream is both economic and political , the south stream was political . 
  turk stream is 100x mroe economical than south stream since turkey is the # 2 consumer next to germany . 
  building a pipeline directly to turkey insures a very stable and profitable flow . 
  building a pipeline from russia to bulgaria and russia to turkey would cost about the same . 
  the issue comes with bridging that pipeline to the real $ $ $ , bulgaria consumes extremely little gas , as well as romania and other balkan countries , the real money is to connect with austrian network of pipelines which go through-out western europe . 
  to build the pipeline from bulgaria to austria was estimated to be around 20-40 billion euros , possibly more . 
  to build the pipeline from turkish-greek border to italy will cost 2 billion euros . 
  italy is connected to austria already so that is the goal . 
  south-stream total cost = 20-40 + billion euros and only guaranteed money once it reaches austria turkstream + greek stream = 10 billion euros and guaranteed money immediately once it flows through turkey russia is not bluffing with turkstream + greek stream . 
  they are often accused of this and are very serious about it . 
  they already flood eu from greece , 90 % of illegals/refugees flee greece once they enter . 
  leaving shengen wo n't change that and wo n't affect greece as much as you think . 
  greece can unilaterally declare all eu passports to require no visa to enter greece . 
  this would only hurt greek vacationers trying to visit other eu countries , but 80 % of greek vacationers do not leave greece . 
  90 % of illegal/economic/refugees etc that enter greece leave greece immediately or soon after according to un report , the same un report said it would rise to 95-99 % in case of grexit . 
  either way they are not staying in greece , and this is just one more reason to hope for grexit happens, 
  why do you think russia wants to start construction of turkstream and greekstream asap ? 
  they are trying to beat the tanap ( turkey ) - tap ( greece ) pipeline to the markets . 
  it is not 100 % certain that russia will completely close off the ukraine pipeline but it has become national priority of russia and gazprom to build an alternative asap . 
  do you have a source that these reforms were asked to be implemented by previous government ? 
  there is only like 5-10 in greece total, 
  why are you making shit up ? 
  [ here is source ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/07/09/germany-can-write-off-greek-debt-like-greece-did-for-germany-in-1953/ ), 
  germany was the biggest receiver of solidarity in the last century , [ here is a picture of the greek finance minister ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nf8jar8.jpg ) writing off half of germany 's debts and allowing the other half to be paid only by export surplus which led to the `` german miracle '' now , i am not saying the two are comparable , but try to view it from the perspective of a greek person under 30 years old . 
  the under-30 's have been the ones most robbed by greek corruption , they likely never voted for previous governments and they never benefited from any of the corruption or past deeds which many benefited off of . 
  multiple generations of greek youth , lasting the next century will now grow up with a new meaning of the word `` solidarity '' and what the eu really stands for . 
  demanding 50 billion of greek real estate to cover interest off debt they were not responsible for , will wake up a lot of people . 
  are you ignoring the fact that greece was ranked # 1 in reforms by oecd between 2007-2014 ? 
  the issue is not reform implementation , but what type of reforms we should continue with . 
  syriza have made major arrests in tax evasion cases which previous government refused to do for the sole purpose of gaining trust for example , and do n't forget the fact that syriza have agreed to every reform made by the troika . 
  you can watch countless speeches by varoufakis when he was fm saying that greece was not going into negotiations with a `` zero-sum '' mentality but genuinely wanted a good reform package . 
  with this decision by germany and others who have calculated that it would likely be easier to squash greece , this has now officially turned the eu into a zero-sum game .
