  this means that the future of the eu will not be based on solidarity but ferocious and ruthless zero-sum mentality , it is basically a pandoras box that is now opened , which can never be closed again . 
  now that the eu is a zero-sum game , that means each country will play by their own rules to maximize benefit even if it is small amount . 
  russian sanctions ? 
  they will be vetoed immediately next vote . 
  why should greece/italy/france / spain who depend the most on russian trade suffer from these sanctions when the pro-grexit bloc ( which is ironically extreme anti-russians ) only want them ? 
  in this zero-sum pandoras box , all bets are off and everything is thrown off the table . 
  energy union ? 
  greece will veto , why should greece suffer from lower competiveness when it is working with russia and azerbaijan to transport gas into the eu and would want to maximize profits . 
  before the zero-sum mentality , it would have passed . 
  these examples are only the tip of the iceberg . 
  it did n't , that is complete bullshit . 
  russia just opened tenders for laying down the pipelines in the black sea to turkey and they just [ officially hired an engineering team to map-out the full pipeline .

  what do you think tsipras will do ? 
  the 12 reforms to be legislated by july 15 ( wednesday ) are the following : streamlining of the vat system and the broadening of the tax base to increase revenue ; upfront measures to improve long-term sustainability of the pension system as part of a comprehensive pension reform programme ; the adoption of the code of civil procedure , which is a major overhaul of procedures and arrangements for the civil justice system and can significantly accelerate the judicial process and reduce costs ; the safeguarding of the full legal independence of elstat ; full implementation of the relevant provisions of the treaty on stability , coordination and governance in the economic and monetary union , in particular by making the fiscal council operational before finalizing the mou and introducing quasi-automatic spending cuts in case of deviations from ambitious primary surplus targets after seeking advice from the fiscal council and subject to prior approval of the institutions ; the transposition of the brrd at the latest within a week with support from the european commission . 
  carry out ambitious pension reforms and specify policies to fully compensate for the fiscal impact of the constitutional court ruling on the 2012 pension reform and to implement the zero deficit clause or mutually agreeable alternative measures by october 2015 ; adopt more ambitious product market reforms with a clear timetable for implementation of all oecd toolkit i recommendations , including sunday trade , sales periods , pharmacy ownership , milk , bakeries , [ over-thecounter pharmaceutical products in a next step ] , as well as for the opening of macro-critical closed professions ( e.g. 
  ferry transportation ) . 
  on the follow-up of the oecd toolkit-ii , manufacturing needs to be included in the prior action ; on energy markets , proceed with the privatisation of the electricity transmission network operator ( admie ) [ , unless replacement measures can be found that have equivalent effect on competition , as agreed by the institutions ] ; on labour markets , undertake rigorous reviews of collective bargaining , industrial action and collective dismissals in line with the timetable and the approach agreed with the institutions . 
  [ in addition , the greek authorities shall modernize the legislative framework for collective dismissals , in line with best practice ] . 
  on the basis of these reviews , labour market policies should be aligned with international and european best practices , and should not involve a return to past policy settings which are not compatible with the goals of promoting sustainable and inclusive growth ; adopt the necessary steps to strengthen the financial sector , including decisive action on non-performing loans and measures to strengthen governance of the hfsf and the banks , in particular by eliminating any possibility for political interference especially in appointment processes ; representatives of the lending institutions will be in athens to monitor the progress of the reforms . 
  usa has already tried to put pressure to stop this deal , they fired the american ambassador in greece 2-3 months ago because he failed to stop this deal . 
  they can not do much about this . 
  russia is officially stopping all gas supplies through ukraine in 2019 and sending all that gas through the turk stream pipeline , which has already began construction , with it stopping at the greek-turkish land border . 
  gas consumption is expected to rise by 30 % over the next decade in europe so russia is making eu an offer they can not refuse . 
  `` in the first wave , creditors want new value added tax rates and abolition of discounted vat on aegean sea islands , a raise in solidarity contributions , raises in luxury and corporate taxes , changes in arrangements of debts to the state , abolition of early retirement , a raise in health contributions in main and supplementary pensions , the opening of closed professions ( notaries , engineers etc ) , transfer of 10 percent of shares of the partly owned by the state telecommunications company ote to the hellenic republic asset development fund ( hradf ) , and a timeframe for privatization of the independent power transmission operator ( admie ) . '', 
  `` the second wave of reforms will follow very soon with the acceleration of the timelines described in the greek list of proposals . 
  it includes changes in income tax , changes in property tax , raise in shipping industry taxes , cuts in defence spending , pension law reforms such as zero deficit clause and merger of security funds , legislation for absorption of decisions of unconstitutionality by the council of state , changes in labor market based on european and international policies , new salary exchequer in the public sector along with structural and operational changes . '', 
  i didnt downvote [ russia and greece have signed a deal to create a joint enterprise for construction of the turkish stream pipeline across greek territory , russian energy minister aleksandr novak said . 
  the pipeline will have a capacity of 47 billion cubic meters a year . 
  the two countries will have equal shares in the company ] ( http://rt.com/business/268279-russia-greece-turkish-stream/ ) `` construction will start in 2016 and be completed by 2019 . '', 
  [ russia and greece signed a pipeline deal last month ] ( http://rt.com/business/268279-russia-greece-turkish-stream/ ) . 
  it will carry 47 billion cubic meters of gas through greece and exported to eu or outside using lng ( greece controls 20 % of world lng shipping ), 
  no they did n't , eu membership is something completely different . 
   and others clearly do n't want greece in the eu this is not about eu membership nor can they decide who stays in or out , greece is staying in the eu but likely not the eurozone, 
   show me where she broke the law . 
  [ when they performed this scam and then immediately after bet massive amounts of money that greece would default using insider knowledge ] ( http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/02/25/banks-bet-greece-defaults-on-debt-they-helped-hide/?_r=2 ), 
  or better , sell russian gas for 100 billion euros through greece . 
  greece has already signed the contract to build the pipeline , a step never taken in the now dead south stream pipeline . 
  the russian pipeline and the azerbaijani pipeline which has plans to bring 120-150 billion cubic meters of gas per year is not for greek consumption but for export . 
  the greek-italian and greek-bulgarian pipelines are also starting construction soon, 
  the current reform proposal handed in yesterday is vastly more austere and crosses 100 % of every red line syriza proposed at the start in february . 
  now that is seen to not only be not good enough but shauble is demanding 50 billion euros of greek assets which is unheard of even in war . 
   a plan drafted by berlin 's finance ministry , with the backing of angela merkel , laid out two stark options for greece : either the government submits to drastic measures such as placing $ 50bn of its assets in a trust fund to pay off its debts , and have brussels take over its public administration , or agree to a `` time-out '' solution where it would leave the eurozone . 
  tsipras : [ `` and then they told me hand over 50 billion euros of real estate '' ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/82192000/jpg/_82192612_501ca151-01c4-46ff-bbf4-fda46b5cca5c.jpg ), 
  the best option would be to restructure the debt without receiving any bailout money , but i do n't think it is possible . 
  if the eu ends up doing a deal with syriza , it will most likely be that 10-20 billion will be released over the next 3 years and then the remaining after a 3 year evaluation . 
  the current reform package is for a 3 year deal . 
  [ greece will accept offer from russia to join brics ] ( http://rt.com/business/257701-greece-russia-brics-invitation/ ) which is imo the best option greece could take now , much better than any deal with eu . 
  after latest news yesterday that brics and shangai co-operation has merged , it will be the future of worldwide growth . 
  it is better greece takes its remaining chips out the game of eu before the real eu collapse happens , because once that happens , only the brics will be left standing . 
  the 60 % youth unemployed only dream of getting 400 euros per month , that is all i will say . 
  what goldman did was work with greek government to cover up their books , [ and then with insider knowledge bet massive amounts of money that greece would default ] ( http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/02/25/banks-bet-greece-defaults-on-debt-they-helped-hide/?_r=1 ) . 
  . i think there is a case for illegal activity here in eu law, 
  [ these are the same people who helped corrupt greek government get into eurozone , and then immediately after bet massive amounts of money that greece would default ] ( http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/02/25/banks-bet-greece-defaults-on-debt-they-helped-hide/?_r=1 ) . 
  that has to be illegal in international law, 
  nothing syriza has done so far makes me think they were looking for a deal , only a way to get out the eurozone without being accused of pulling the trigger themselves , but we shall see what happens . 
  i do n't think anyone is begging , greece is trying to get a fair deal for both sides . 
  if that is not possible then there are other options . 
  no , they were elected to stop `` recessionary measures '' not to end austerity . 
  the first thing varoufakis did in office was to pledge greece will keep a 1 % surplus `` forever '' which is the very definition of austerity . 
  maybe the fact that syriza have been in power for 5 months and are only asking for a chance should play a role , greece destroyed its 40 year 2 party system for the fact that they failed the country . 
  syriza have already agreed massive tax reforms in the latest reform proposal . 
  if there is no solidarity shown to syriza , please do not get angry when no solidarity is shown back in the near future after greece is kicked out the eurozone and partners with russia/china and does what is necessary to survive . 
  syriza is not anti-austerity , otherwise they would have not handed in a reform package that is more austere than anything else before it in any other country in the eu , ever, 
   greece also agreed to do reforms for receiving the bailout but did n't do them as agreed . 
  greece is ranked # 1 in reform implementation between 2007-2014 , you have no idea what you are talking about . 
  why do you think greece lost 30-35 % of its gdp ? 
  the reforms were aimed at cost-cutting and reduction . 
  that is the point , tsipras can not be blamed now by greek population for not trying . 
  he created a reform package that was much more in-depth and demanding than the one asked for in february and the creditors not only declined but almost mockingly ask for 50 billion euros of greek state assets which are likely worth 100x more . 
  now tsipras can leave the eurozone and nobody can claim he left the eurozone on purpose , so a political win-win for him and his party . 
  it looks like plan a and plan b plan a - greece hands over 50 billion of `` assets '' which will likely be worth 10-100x more in a decade for a `` deal '' plan b - `` time-out '' of eurozone . 
  somehow i wonder if tsipras plan all along was to leave the eurozone but not be responsible for pulling the trigger , because if that was the plan , he just achieved it . 
  currently around 90 % of immigrants who enter greece , leave greece very soon or immediately after according to un reports . 
  this is because there is nothing you can really do to stop them . 
  it is not like greek government puts them in busses and brings them to border , there are very sophisticated and wealthy internanational smuggling gangs that work in greece to bring these people out of greece . 
  if grexit happens , un expect that number to raise to 95-99 % , which is not that much different . 
  i do n't think shauble understands geo-politics , he is brilliant in finance but there is a reason merkel leads germany and not him . 
  `` at any costs '' is extreme , the final deal will likely have a very detailed set of goals to achieve . 
  good guy france, 
  no problem, 
  china with this deal has complete access to eurasia to transport their exports to europe and asia in a centralized system for far cheaper and russia likely got full access to chinese markets with this deal . 
  [ creditors make ` positive evaluation ' of greek debt proposals : eu source ] ( http://news.yahoo.com/creditors-positive-evaluation-greek-debt-proposals-eu-source-213927246.html;_ylt=awrbt8yfpabvewyaiz1xnyoa;_ylu=x3odmtezyjzmnw05bgnvbg8dymyxbhbvcwmxbhz0awqdvklqnje4xzeec2vja3nj ), 
   according to the greece news agency ( amna ) 's report , the minister of state for combatting corruption panayotis nikoludis ordered that all the assets of the officials who are linked with the alleged corruption to be under control by the ministry and their bank accounts to be freezed if necessary . 
  hopefully they get jail time also, 
  [ here the minister talks about the incredible amounts of corruption from previous governments ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/04/06/combating-corruption-minister-nikoloudis-all-greek-contracts-included-kickbacks/ ) , and [ another article ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/03/24/greek-govt-to-go-after-80000-rich-tax-evaders/ ), 
  i think that [ cosco will win piraeus port ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lr0uwkd.jpg ) and maersk thessaloniki most likely . 
  russia is also very heavily interested in thessaloniki port so it will be interesting to see what happens . 
  one of the other major privatizations being pushed in latest reform package is for the [ hellinkon development project ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zn-3unactc ) , the largest urban development in europe , expected to bring 30-50 ,000 jobs and 1-2 % of gdp per year . 
  nobody is asking to forgive 300b of debt . 
  the primary focus right now is to re-structure the 8 billion owed to ecb between july 20-august 20 to allow for a smooth reform implementation . 
   california and spain have much better olive oil anyway . 
  this is how world wars start, 
  not all the islands , there will still be budget islands for cost-saving vacationers . 
  only the wealthiest islands like mykonos/crete/santorini / etc. 
  i think tsipras/varoufakis burned to many bridges to get this approved, 
  german tourism is on par to match or surpass 2014 . 
  the scaremongering did n't really work that well . 
  i think the whole hippie thing nowadays is attractive to wealthy business-types looking for an escape . 
  take a few weeks off to go full hippie then back to business in the corporate world .
