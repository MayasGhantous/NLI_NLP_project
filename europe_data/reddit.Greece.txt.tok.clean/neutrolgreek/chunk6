  in an interview i saw , the tv reporter was interviewing the ex-pm of fyrom and the pm told the interview person that fyrom should accept its real history and let go of the macedonian fable . 
  the tv guy literally had a near melt-down , he got enraged but kept calm and told him that it they are true makedons !, 
  and to say otherwise is betrayal , etc . 
  he got really hurt from that statement and you could tell . 
  [ here is the interview ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvmr0cwskgi ) best part ex-pm of fyrom : ** in 1800 's you used to be killed if you said this country had anything to do with alexander , it used to be treason !,

  [ from recent polling done last week ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/09/21/opinion-polls-syriza-in-the-lead-over-new-democracy/ ) by two different polling groups , gd was sitting at 6 % for both which is lower support than in recent years . 
  gd is also basically tied with a growing pasok and new independent party . 
  the two main parties are each polling at around 20-23 % each, 
  greek islands , just pick anyone, 
  these idiots are polling at very low % compared to 2-3 years ago , looks like these idiotic stunts/leaked videos are making them look like fools , which they are . 
  even disregarding the naming issue which alone will prevent them from ever joining the eu/nato , lets see two other major issues . 
  economy - 4,000 $ gdp/capita which fyrom has is on par with the poorest in europe 2 . 
  major ethnic tensions , possible civil war within 10-20 years fyrom is 35-40 % islamic minority , mainly albanians . 
  who also just declared a new republic within fyrom this week . 
  there were ethnic riots in the last few months after a series of killings by albanians and tensions/hatred is rising between both groups . 
  even if they somehow solve these two major issues , which they will not . 
  then there is the greece issue , which is not a minor / `` petty '' issue like many people like to make it seem . 
  the greek region of makedon in northern greece has 3-4 million people and they feel like their culture/history is being stolen from them to appease a country and to be `` politically correct '' ( which is something greeks are n't ) you can see in just the recent ukraine-russia war happening that a 150 year old `` idea '' that putin brought called `` novarossiya '' which is the russian idea of controlling basically half of ukraine . 
  even hundreds of years later can come back to haunt a country . 
  after all the main reason fyrom even exists is because the soviets thought it would be a useful tool in going to war with greece and take over thessaloniki harbor and create a soviet naval base in the aegean . 
  in the far distant future , anything is possible so it is wise for any country to take the necessary steps to prevent a radical ideology like fyrom 's from becoming more powerful .

   the prophet , peace be upon him , had said that there would be a time in which there would be three islamic armies . 
  one in the levant ( the area which includes modern palestine , lebanon , syria and jordan ) , one in iraq and one in yemen .

  greece has had record tourism seasons 3-4 years in a row with record 22-23 million tourists this season . 
  i think that `` image '' has largely gone away , but maybe some people still see it as that .

  the byzantine empire was the suppressor of western civilization . 
  the state religion , greek orthodoxy , was incredibly paranoid of outsiders or anything outside the `` status quo '' , they hoarded all the knowledge of ancient greece and kept it hidden . 
  only after the fall of konstantinopoli did this knowledge spread since much of the library/great works were transported to italy along hundreds of thousands of educated greeks which sparked the renaissance .

  i am positive it was the templars , or a combination of knights of st. john + templars , since you have to remember the templars were an ultra-secretive group but had enormous wealth ( almost positive they are the ancestors of the swiss ) after the templars were kicked out of jerusalem , they went to cyprus for around 50-60 years to re-group and pool their resources . 
  they decided to build their headquarters in rodos and the castle city was born . 
  the only group of people wealthy enough to build such a city in short amount of time were the templars , since they were the first banking elite in history . 
  we can only hope to be as wealthy one day .
