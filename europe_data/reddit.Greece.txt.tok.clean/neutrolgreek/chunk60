  kke is more of a cult than a political party nowadays so they can be safely ignored . 
  short-term will have the biggest impact , long-term is sustainable if you look at what is due between july 2015-2030 . 
  the biggest hurdle is the 8 billion owed to ecb between july 20-august 20 , 2015 which must be restructured for a smooth reform implementation . 
  after 2015 , debt is actually very sustainable, 
  i would love to see this become wide-spread , it would bring in a lot of hippie tourism at least . 
  tsipras and co have never been against austerity as a concept , they have primarily been against `` recessionary measures '' a term they often use . 
  i am almost 99 % positive that the yes/no referendum had absolutely nothing to do with the austerity package and instead was made to put the final nail in the coffin for new democracy , whose leader immediately resigned/kicked out after the no victory . 
  i think syriza knew going into the referendum that the yes side would be backed by pasok/nd and the media oligarchs and thus `` wake up '' a lot of people who were not aware of this all-surrounding corruption and the fact that pasok/nd are basically the same party even though they spent the last 40 years dividing the population and pretended they were not . 
  tsipras is in coalition with the most right-wing ( non-nazi ) party in greece , anel . 
  anel is more right than ukip so i do n't think he cares about right-wing ally 's, 
  from my experience german posters are the most neutral about the current crisis . 
  also i think you meant extreme minority * , right ? 
  lets forget that greece has 30 % unemployment and 60 % youth unemployment which is 2-5x worse than other eu countries . 
  the problem is that greece is n't `` complaining '' really about current economy which has been in a great depression for 5 years . 
  what greece needs is to destroy the `` grexit '' curse once and for all , either within the euro or outside of it . 
  there is no way forward for greece if grexit is still a term being used to describe greece since it is like bug-spray to investors . 
  the general fear by eu leaders is that if they are lenient with greece then other countries will demand the same treatment , which they likely will and could cause a chaotic situation . 
  they have most likely calculated that it will be less costly economically to push greece out then to deal with other countries asking for same treatment . 
  but then the problem is that pushing greece out will have geo-political risks which is why merkel is still hoping for a deal , but shaeuble and the bundestag are unified against any deal and merkel can not risk the political fall-out of going against shaeuble who is now more popular than merkel in germany and the bundestag . 
  the no vote according to tsipras and co. was that the austerity package should have no `` recessionary measures '' . 
  the reform package presented before the referendum was also an austerity package , just like this one . 
  you have that source , but there are dozens of other sources who claim otherwise . 
  your `` source ' is 100 % fact un-biased ( lol ) but the dozens of sources which prove i am right are `` bullshit agenda lying '' . 
  [ we should be clear : almost none of the huge amount of money loaned to greece has actually gone there . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/29/joseph-stiglitz-how-i-would-vote-in-the-greek-referendum ) it has gone to pay out private-sector creditors -- including german and french banks . 
  greece has gotten but a pittance , but it has paid a high price to preserve these countries ' banking systems . 
  the imf and the other `` official '' creditors do not need the money that is being demanded . 
  under a business-as-usual scenario , the money received would most likely just be lent out again to greece . 
  do n't get your hopes up , this is just syriza factions agreeing to present their reform package in hopes of a deal . 
  most likely it will get rejected like the previous ones . 
  that makes no sense , i think you mean possibly the 66 % of the 8-10 % that actually went there . 
  90-92 % of the `` bailout '' never entered greece itself to be `` taken out '' . 
  that bailout money went directly to deutsche bank/etc to pay back old debt on their books . 
  [ new analysis of imf figures , released by the jubilee debt campaign , show that almost all of the money lent by the imf , european governments and the european central bank to greece has been used to pay off reckless lenders , with less than 10 % of it reaching the greek people . 
  ] ( http://jubileedebt.org.uk/press-release/least-90-greek-bailout-paid-reckless-lenders ), 
  a 200-250 billion loan to greece of which 92 % of it never entered country , is considered `` free money '', 
  i guess they had to do this one last favor for samaras, 
  yes/no vote please, 
  ok , [ but why does bbc say that sinn fein are `` extreme far-right party '' in this doc ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1w82di-peq ), 
   [ but , how about cutting 90 % of greece 's military spending ? 
  ] ( http://cdn1.eaglerising.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/obama-mad.jpg ), 
  the dictatorship didnt last for 30 years itself , only 10 but there was a 30-40 year period where greece became isolated and extremely backwards and really only climbed out of it when it started the eu process . 
  immediately after ww2 , the civil war divided the nation and then teh dictator completely ruined it for a decade and then another decade of in-fighting and backwardsness . 
  nd/pasok emerged from this civil war mind-set and mis-managed the country for 40 years until syriza destroyed their 2 party system . 
  politics in greece has been absolute shit since post ww2 and this is legitamately the first time since ww2 where there is at least some chance for greece with a more forward thinking instead of backwards thinking political force . 
  also hypocritical , making it seem like poland was left in the ditch while greeks profited . 
  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-04-29/polish-300-billion-aid-package-hides-eu-expansion-flaws http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/14/us-poland-airports-specialreport-iduskbn0js06k20141214 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elsrwokvpay also , he makes it seem like greece had it easy and only poland suffered during the cold war . 
  i bet he has no clue of the greek civil war which basically kicked off the cold war and then the 30 year dictatorship . 
  it wouldnt have to happen right now , it could just be a clause in the agreement . 
  something like if all reforms agreed to are implemented then greece would be allowed a major debt conference in 2016 with the goal of creating an institution to manage greek banks and debt which would then lead to a banking/fiscal union . 
  unless the eu leaders can unite and declare that the solution to this current problem is a banking/fiscal/budget union , this would massively boost investor confidence in greece which is at an all time low with the never-ending `` grexit ' fears . 
  if grexit fears could be destroyed , greece would have a major growth . 
  they agree on most of the reforms , basically 99 % with very minor differences that could be stamped out in an afternoon . 
  the biggest issue is that syriza will not accept any deal without a debt management clause for post-reforms . 
  this is because this will remove the grexit fears and boost investor confidence in greece and could allow for a sustainable long-term growth . 
  the problem with this is that if they are lenient with greece and allow a form of debt restructure post-reforms then other countries will ask for the same , so the dilemma is whether to allow greece this post-reforms debt clause or to put up a hard-line and not allow any form of debt management which would lead to a currency exit . 
  i personally think that they should allow a debt conference post-reforms along-side spain/portugal/italy , etc to prepare for a banking/fiscal/budget union . 
  i think greece would accept a deal which makes it join a banking union , this entire spectacle might actually lead to something great for the eu , but we shall see . 
  doubt it , tsipras is in coalition with the most right-wing party in greece outside of golden dawn . 
  him and kammenos , the leader of anel extreme-right party and coalition partners are bff . 
  syriza is also partnering with sinn fein in ireland which i believe is a far-right party . 
  a coalition of syriza , podemos , front national , sinn fein , ukip and others is not that hard to imagine . 
   we demand the nationalization of all trusts . 
   we demand profit-sharing in large industries . 
  hitler was a commie after all . 
  i think his response meant that he agreed with everything verhofstadt said , especially when he said that tsipras needs his help . 
   since he kicked out the troika , he refuses to show the eu the books . 
  they were not . 
  the `` brussels group '' was the new name of troika advisors in athens and they have been in athens almost every day since syriza took office . 
  i agree that they should work even closer and make a final reform package which both sides feel is good enough . 
  [ tsipras response was also good ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih-ogxesjqg ), 
  it is a big step , syriza have made some very high profile tax evasion arrests , just last week they charged the most famous liquor producer in greece , metaxas , with tax evasion and he faces life in prison . 
  they are sending the first signals to the elite that they are not afraid to fuck them up . 
  if nokia makes a good windows 10 phone that actually feels like a mini-windows computer i might consider it actually . 
  if you like nutella , merenda is the same thing but much better . 
  something like 50-60 % of greek olive oil is sold wholesale to italy who then bottles it in fancy designs and prices up the cost 10-20x or more . 
  i think syriza mp said something about stopping this recently . 
  this was always the plan since day 1 . 
  [ also tsipras response to verhofstadt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih-ogxesjqg ) he touches upon some of the major reforms that have taken place which previous governments were not willing to do . 
  good speech [ tsipras response was also good ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih-ogxesjqg ), 
  say what you will about farage , but he gives a damn good speech . 
  should have never sold nokia . 
  amazing marketing brand that could have just been re-built into an android phone instead of a shitty windows phone . 
   and solved it in an ingenious way - they turned receipts into lottery tickets . 
  that is also in the current syriza reform package , it should be implemented in 2015 . 
  point 2 is critical for greece , otherwise no deal can be made . 
  for you to understand this , you need to understand why `` grexit '' is a curse upon greece which is destroying it . 
  `` grexit '' is like bug-spray to investors , nobody wants to touch greece as long as grexit is hanging over everyones head and foreign investment has dried up even though there are hundreds ofbillions of euros worth of investment opportunity in greece . 
  nobody wants to invest as long as they fear a future currency switch and devaluation , which then becomes the best time to invest . 
  there can be no deal which does not remove the grexit fear , otherwise greece will be in a crisis again in 2-3 years and nobody wants that because it would likely lead to chaos in greece . 
  the only real solution is to go back to drachma and slowly re-build since i do not believe the creditors or their supporters are keen on giving greece a break with debt relief which could actually calm down grexit fears . 
   but i am not sure if they have a concept on how to tackle tax evasion . 
  read the reforms 15,000 person tax agency independent from government and corporate interests , only answer to parliament is a core reform . 
  making the tax police/agents have more power limiting middle class evasion by promoting debit/credit use . 
  debit/credit lottery from receipts , forcing all purchases above 100 euros to be debit/credit . 
  . forcing all smallb usiness to modernize the cash register with electronic network connection to finance ministry for debit/credit payments and more, 
  there is a large difference between greeks pay 0 % tax and are biggest tax evaders , to the reality . 
  [ greeks pay 6 % less tax as % of gdp than eu average and greek tax evasion is close to eu average . 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/a/cdbjo ) greece collected 50 billion euros in taxes in 2013/2014 the problem with anti-greek propaganda is that the eu leaders have forced all the blame on the average greek .
