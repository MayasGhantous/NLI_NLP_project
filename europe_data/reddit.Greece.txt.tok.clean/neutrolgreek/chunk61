  . yet not once have they brought up military spending which was the main issue with greece when it spent 400-500 billion euros on military in 25 years . 
  it is funny how merkel never brings up these facts but instead likes to blame the average baker in greece .

  syriza was that `` tearing down and rebuild '' . 
  . let me explain really quickly . 
  nd/pasok goverened the country for 40 years of mis-management in a corrupt , oligarch friendly environment that saw no real reforms to change society in decades . 
  syriza was voted for the sole fact that they destroyed the 2 party system of greece . 
  imagine if some party destroyed the democrat/republican system in usa , it is the same thing but smaller scale . 
  syriza have already made more tax evasion/corruption arrests than the last decade , and they have been in power for 5 months . 
  last week they arrested metaxas , the most famous liquor producer in greece ceo and he faces life in prison for evasion . 
  syriza has vowed they are targetting 80,000 total wealthy evaders but are starting with the lagarde list first . 
  so far 3-4 major arrests with metaxas being latest one . 
  they also pledged to stamp out lower/middle class tax evasion by heavily promiting debit/credit use , which is one of the core reforms of the package . 
  things like having a debit/credit card lottery for receipt or forcing all purchased about 100 euros to be made with debit/credit . 
  another reform is to force every single small business in greece to modernize their register to be connected to the finance ministry network . 
  just a small sample of reforms . 
  syriza is the change . 
  not the problem like you have been led to believe . 
  the did not recall any reforms , they want to re-work reforms by stopping the previous reforms which were solely aimed at cost-cutting pensions/wages , etc into a downward spiral and instead aim reforms at tax collection , evasion , corruption , public sector reforms , real estate reforms , etc. 
  i agree with that at least 100 % , the one thing i do n't understand about hard-liners like you is this . 
  pasok/nd who created this debt bubble and ruled greece for 40 years were absolutely corrupt to the core scum who worked with their oligarch shipping and media friends to under-mine greek society . 
  syriza is a party chosen by the people to destroy pasok/nd and restore order in greece , bring down corruption , arrest evaders and reform society from the bottom up , and they have proven themselves up to the task . 
  yet , pasok/nd are the `` good guys '' be pro-eu media and syriza are evil bastards who destroyed greece ( even though being in power for 5 months ), 
   you know , something that greece would need , but would never agree to . 
  because syriza are evil commies right ? 
  the actual commies in greece , kke are not very fond of syriza . 
  they have been in power for 5 months but they have not rescued greece from 40 years of mis-management so obviously syriza is incompetent , i do not understand this logic . 
  [ here is source ] ( http://www.fsmitha.com/h2/ch24cld2a.htm ) , the biggest issue was the dictatorship post civil war which put the country in a isolated state . 
   both countries had marshall aid . 
  greece had the equivalent or $ 47 per person in greece considering the population in late 40s ( 366,000,000 / 7,632,000 ) and germany half of that at $ 21 per person . 
  ( 1,448,000,000 / 68,000,009 ) greece entered a civil war which saw 10 % of the population killed and entered a 30 year of dictatorship while most of europe was re-building post-ww2 with the marshall aid and in general economic boom . 
  most of greece 's aid money was spent to supply the pro-west side fighting the soviet backed communist . 
   the debt to the eu the first payment only comes in 2020 . 
   i do n't understand what you mean by this ? 
  [ greece owes 8 billion to eu in a 30 day period starting july 20 ] ( http://graphics.wsj.com/greece-debt-timeline/?mod=e2fb ) , or are you refering to something else , 
  `` give me money '' . 
  this is not about money but about debt sustainability . 
  greece has been running a surplus for 2 years straight , so money is not the problem , massive debt payments which crush all surplus and make it impossible for growth is the main issue . 
  the problem for germany is 1 . 
  be lenient with greece and allow for a restructure of debts under certain conditions ( most likely full reform package ) , but then have spain/irish/etc governments demand the same . 
  be harsh with greece and say you will keep your red line for no debt restructure but greece leaves euro full of `` unknown unknowns '' either way it seems like a lose-lose for merkel . 
  syriza did n't cause this mess , it was previous corrupt shits who ran greece into the ground over 40 years . 
  greece is n't asking for a debt wipe . 
  it needs a restructure of debt for sustainability, 
  greece does n't need money , it has n't received any for 12 months . 
  since greece has been running on a surplus , what it needs is a restructure of debt so it can become sustainable and regain investor trust, 
  greece fired 300,000 public workers and reduced pensions by 40-50 % under previous government, 
  because the troika refused to put a clause in the final agreement for a debt conference post-reforms . 
  this is the one absolute hard-line syriza is putting up , but besides that they agree on the reform package . 
   we will tell the people , who kept our country afloat : fuck you ! , and then they will accept our demands . 
  troika and syriza agree on basically 99 % of reforms , i think it was juncker who even said so himself . 
  the issue is that syriza wants a committment by eu to manage the debt better in exchange of implementing the full reform package . 
  the troika are in debate whether to allow a debt conference post-reforms but i do not think they will allow it and talks will fail . 
  also if greece defaults , the debt will still be there , this has nothing to do with that but instead has to do with drachma/euro debate . 
  that would be worse visuals than a serbian film, 
  [ new greek finance minister speaking at sinn fe\u0301in event ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wofkcembrge&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4m39s ), 
  this has nothing to do with the megathread, 
  ughh what ? 
  greece went 5 years in a great depression which would have tore up most eu countries in civil war . 
  . and crime drastically reduced . 
  you think after what amounted to a peaceful revolution and united stance there is now , ** now ** going to be bloodshed ? 
  after everything that has happened , now is the least likely . 
  if greece signed a 3rd bailout under the previous government , there would have been bloodshed , but not now . 
  you are missing the part where greece was involved in 4-5 major wars in a 50 years span in that period . 
  [ its a small club ] ( http://www.zeit.de/2015/26/thomas-piketty-schulden-griechenland/komplettansicht ) , but ok, 
  just when i think / r/europe can not get any lower . 
  ofcourse he won , the vote was basically a peaceful revolution in favor of syriza party , who just cemented their power for at least a decade or more . 
  the yes campaign was backed by the media oligarchs , corrupt politicians nd/pasok and other scum who caused the crisis in the 1st place . 
  immediately after the land-slide no victory the leader of nd , who ran greece into the ground resigned and the next day syriza got every party to unify under his leadership . 
  [ greece ranked # 1 in reforms by oecd between 2007-2014 ] ( http://blogs-images.forbes.com/stevekeen/files/2015/02/image0011.png ) the idiotic propaganda is that `` greece literally implemented zero reforms '' . 
  . nothing could be further from the truth . 
  the problem is that the reforms were aimed at cost-cutting so much it created a downward spiral where greece lost 30-35 % of its economy compared to other austerity program countries which lost 5-8 %, 
  [ tax evasion in greece is close to eu average ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mujpx4e.gif ) while merkel and other leaders scream anti-greek propaganda blaming the average villager in greece , they never bring up the fact in how greece spent 400-500 billion euros on foreign military equipment the last 25 years . 
  it was artificially low long before qe , since the 1st bailout . 
  [ the opposite , germany has benefited massively from grexit and the longer `` grexit '' fears last the better for their export industry . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ruvhgki.jpg ) `` grexit '' is basically an artificial way to continually supress the value of the euro in markets , and an artifically low euro currency is the best thing for german exports which have sky-rocketed since grexit fears started and started to supress the euro value . 
  if greece exits the euro i expect the euro to climb in value which will hurt german exports , so merkel has absolutely no reason to remove grexit fears or want them back to the drachma , the win-win for merkel would be for greece to accept another extend and pretend agreement so grexit could continue to supress the euro value and help german exports . 
  i agree but it wo n't happen , the troika are putting up a hard-line that they will not discuss debt management at all or even hint at when they will . 
  syriza 's red line in negotiations is that there must be a clause in the final agreement so that after sryiza implements all reforms there can be a debt management conference . 
  the troika will never agree to put a debt management clause for post-reforms in the agreement , so i do n't think a deal is possible . 
  if greece 2007 went to drachma it would have been a disaster . 
  but greece in 2015 is far ** far ** different than greece 2007 . 
  the hardest and most brutal part of a currency change , the `` fiscal adjustment '' period has already taken place . 
  greece lost 30-35 % of its economy since 2007/8 which is the normal if a currency change had happened . 
  [ greece was following the reforms under the previous government ] ( http://blogs-images.forbes.com/stevekeen/files/2015/02/image0011.png ) the issue is that the reforms were all cost-cutting reforms which is ok up to a certain point . 
  but when the cost-cutting reforms shrink the economy by 30-35 % , compared to portugal which only lost 3-5 % of gdp . 
  there is a problem . 
  but that is not the issue now , the past is the past so when syriza was voted there was hope that the troika could see that there was honest effort by greek side to implement reforms and start growing as it had already fiscally adjusted to a 35 % lower economy . 
  but instead we get anti-greek propaganda , attempted regime change by un-elected eu beareucrats and the same attempted reforms which brought greece into a great depression with no hope . 
  the eu is doomed to failure if they think this is how a `` union '' should respond to an internal problem . 
  because greece is absolutely miniscule to the challenges the eu will be facing in the coming decades . 
  well , basically focus on renewable energy with a goal to be 100 % renewable energy by 2050 would be the primary focus . 
   if it turns out they were n't negotiating in good faith at all http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/03/us-eurozone-greece-imf-iduskcn0pd20120150703 http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/07/02/world/europe/ap-eu-greece-the-latest.html?_r=0 `` others criticized the report . 
  ashoka mody , a visiting professor at princeton university , said it shows the imf and the european union ** were not `` negotiating in good faith '' ** with greece since they did not talk about debt relief . '', 
  you ' r a good guy/gal , thanks, 
  the reason syriza works is because it is a democracy within a democracy , so only the most trusted leader can actually lead the party through an internal vote from all the political factions instead of who has the best family name ( samaras , etc ), 
  he is not retiring actually , he will stay in parliament and be influential within syriza .
