  you have to remember that syriza has only been in power for 5 months , they have shown to be up for the task though which is why people voted for them .

   and the greek media totally isnt anti-german of course not , the differnece between greek and german media is that greek tabloids have very critical articles about merkel and shaeuble . 
  in fact merkel is pretty well liked . 
  german media is extremely anti-greek , spreading lies that nobody in greece pays taxes , all corrupt , etc . 
  it is fucking disgusting and will not be forgotten .

  [ the foreign minister of greece visited rom for the first time in 11 years recently . 
  ] ( http://www.balkaneu.com/fyrom-greece-agree-building-trust-countries/ ) if they join nato it will have nothing to do with greece 's problems but the fact that greece could use them as a potential ally . 
   germany submitted entirely and followed whatever demands its creditors wanted . 
  the creditor ( including greece ) `` demands '' were allowing germany to pay back its debt only using surplus money which is what syriza has requested this entire time . 
  here is the thing though , greece has followed every single request for budget management the last 2 years . 
  every single quarter posted a budget surplus ( before debt payments ) and greece had already lost 30 % of its economy so it had already fiscally adjusted to a lower level . 
  considering we are in a `` union '' ( lol ) , you would think that there would be some kind of common decency to accept that greeks have shown honest effort in balancing the budget and now all greece needs would be to unload some of the major debt hurdles , mainly july/august 2015 and allow for a smooth transition into long-term sustainability , removing the `` grexit '' curse from greece which would open lots of investment . 
  instead we got attemped regime change , propaganda , anti-greek media across every eu country using eu official stance as the `` right '' stance and everything greece requests as `` crazy , commie '' stuff . 
  even though tsipras handed in a 47 page reform package which introduced massive reforms , including building a 15,000 person tax agency and massive curbs to tax evasion and other major reforms . 
  after all this , the budget surplus , reform package and considering greece is in the `` union '' , you would think there would be a single fucking person in the eu to show some kind of compassion to the 60 % youth unemployed and just give them a small glimmer of hope . 
  but we got threats , anti-greek propaganda and attempted coups . 
  this is not the eu i thought it was , this eu wo n't last much longer as this is now the precedent it has set and greece must leave now before it gets stuck in the middle of the upcoming full blown eu implosion . 
  eu was a mistake and its time greece left the table before the real shit-storm happens eventually . 
  greece has had 60 % youth un-employment and 30 % general unemployment . 
  half the countries in the eu would already be in complete anarchy if this happened there , and yet crime has gone down in greece . 
  greek people are more united now than ever , the no vote was basically a peaceful revolution against the old `` system '' , which was campaigning for the yes vote backed by eu . 
  the age of retirement is 62-63 , and will most likely be raised to 65-67 this year . 
  i am sure many did retire in their 50 's in the `` good old days '' , but then again a lot of things happened then that do not any more . 
  all greeks literally work 2 hours a day in between 4 hour lunch/siesta . 
  you people are so fucking ridiculous , and i bet this gets upvoted . 
  no syriza are super commie nazi 's , the next stage of politics, 
  ok , but why do you assume there is not a major campaign to improve it ? 
  half of syriza 's proposed reforms had to do with extreme tax collection measures . 
  one of them including forming a 15,000 person tax collection agency independent from government ( reduce corruption ) and other reforms aimed at middle class tax evasion , primarily focused on promoting debit/credit transactions . 
  there have been more major tax evasion arrests while syriza has been in power then the entire last 10 years . 
  greek tax payers pay 6 % lower than eu average as % of gdp . 
  50 billion a year , where do you people get `` no taxes at all '', 
  idiot, 
  sustainability, 
  except the imf even admitted that the bailouts were never going to work in the first place . 
  the eu failed the `` trust '' when it forced upon greece the largest loan in human history to a bankrupt state and a deal which the imf even admitted was doomed to failure . 
  the constant `` grexit '' fears has destroyed the greek economy . 
  the only thing syriza is proposing was to pay the debt back in a healthy way and remove this grexit fear so investment can return . 
  instead there was ultimatums and threats to sign an unacceptable deal which would only see grexit fears continue and grow . 
  this is the `` union '' we have now , one where nations are at each others throats because they can not see common sense . 
  this is not the union that will last long , if they can not agree to restore greece an economy which has lost 30 % of gdp under troika management . 
  . how in the fuck will they manage with the incredible and much greater tasks coming soon across europe . 
  this `` union '' is only a union on paper , and it will remain that way . 
  partly true yes , but foreign investment completely ceased since the grexit fears ramped up as nobody wanted to invest due to `` grexit '' being over everyones head 24/7 . 
  signing an agreement that creditors demanded would have kept grexit fears alive and well and possibly even stronger . 
  greece proposal is to remove this grexit fear so investment can flow back in with a confidence boost , yet the creditors do not want this and want to continue the suffering which is unacceptable in this `` union '' . 
  considering the fact that greece lost 30 % of its economy and was able to cut its budget to post a budget surplus every single quarter for 2 years straight , i would think that the creditor negotiatiors would take this into consideration and make a plan where greece can manage its debt in a healthy way and remove grexit fears so everyone wins . 
  instead we get djisellbloem saying `` take it or leave it '' to tsipras with an offer that would further ruin greece . 
  it is better to exit the euro currency now while greece has already fiscally adjusted to lower gdp , instead of continuing with euro and then in the future have to deal with this shit again . 
  [ `` since the 1974 turkish invasion of cyprus , greece has spent an estimated $ 216bn ( 300 bn $ ) on armaments , although i am 100 % certain that in absolute terms its defence expenditure is much greater than official documents would show due to the so-called secret funds the state has access to , '' said katerina tsoukala , a brussels-based security expert . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/19/greece-military-spending-debt-crisis ), 
  greece has been strangled through these negotiations in liquidity and foreign investment . 
  most countries would already be in civil war by this point ( you will get to see that eventually in other european nations very soon ) . 
  going to the drachma is the only way to restore stability imo , the euro and the institutions backing it have proven that the `` union '' part of the eu is nothing but a farce . 
  the average pension in greece is 500 euros , and that is used to sometimes support up to 4-5 people due to un-employment being 30 % , 60 % for youth . 
  greece had agreed to reform high cost pensions , but creditors were demanding to reduce the 500 euros to 300-400 euros and put many people in starvation . 
  most of that `` borrowed money '' went to pay for military goods , especially german ones over these last few years . 
  400-500 billion euros was spent on military equipment in a 25 years span , which is insane . 
  germany profited the most out of these military deals [ considering 15 % of germanys total military exports go to greece , and they do not want greece to cut military spending ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/19/greece-military-spending-debt-crisis ) you act like greece is 100 % at fault and absolutely no outside forces contributed to this crisis , ignorance is bliss my friend .

  firstly no outside money has entered greece since august 2014 and greece has posted a budget surplus every quarter for 2 years . 
  the easiest thing syriza could have done is to sign an agreement in february for the 7-8 billion euros in eu money , but this would have only led to another crisis in a few months . 
  the best course negotiations could have gone is for a sustainable deal where greece is allowed to pay back the debt in a healthy way without further reducing the economy , which has been reduced by 30-35 % since 2011 and with 60 % youth un-employment . 
  is there not a single person in the eu who can find a middle ground ? 
  where is the `` unity '' , the same unity greece showed to germany when it forgave your debts after ww2 after the atrocities that took place in greece . 
  nobody in syriza is asking for the debt to be wiped clean , all syriza is asking is for a way to manage the debt in a healthy way so the creditors can get their money and greece is allowed to prosper . 
  if the ultimatum eu showed to tsipras with no debt management and no hope is the way eu is acting , there is no hope for the eu in the future and it is better for greece to exit now before it really gets bad in this `` union '' . 
  nobody voted to take the `` bailouts '' . 
  before the bailouts , all of greek debt was owed to private banks , and so to prevent a banking crisis across europe , instead of defaulting and possibly triggering a european crisis but could have saved greece , the government took the `` bailouts '' . 
  these bailouts swapped the private banking debt with ecb debt and now you have posts like these claiming `` greeks stole our money '' . 
  nobody in greece profited from `` your money '' , outside of a small group of elite doing insane military deals where most of this money went . 
  imf director : [ `` the bailouts bailed out the banks , not greece '' ] ( https://youtu.be/zjkvm6yc_za?t=6m49s ), 
   because the greeks do n't care about their own obligations ?? 
  how is this fair ??? 
  i do n't think a 3rd bailout is possibly or was in discussion . 
  the negotiations were for releasing the final 7-8 billion euros of the 2011 bailout . 
  as far as sacrifices , greece lost 30-35 % of gdp in 3-4 years and has 60 % youth unemployment following the troikas orders . 
  portugal lost 3-4 % of its gdp in that same time . 
  the easiest thing greece/syriza could have done is to sign an agreement in february during the 1st rounds of negotiations , they have said this themselves . 
  eu was ready to hand over the 7-8 billion no questions asked aslong as they signed the deal . 
  but all this deal would have done is extended the problem for another 6 months or year and then the next crisis would begin . 
  it is not entitlement . 
  greece is going through a great depression that is far worse than the one in 1920 's usa to put for comparison . 
  the greek side wants a deal to pay back the debt in a healthy way that could promote growth and sustainability . 
  the creditor side wants to push a deal which only kicks the can down the road for a few months/years and then greece is in an even worse situation in the future . 
  considering greece has 60 % youth unemployment , something has to be done so an entire 1-2 generations are not lost . 
  do you think greece should suffer with another 15 years of great depression because that is what greece is facing if it just blindly accepts the creditors proposal . 
  or there can be an agreement were both sides can get what they want , which is not that hard to obtain . 
  also you can not compare greek austerity to irish/portugese austerity . 
  greece lost 30-35 % of its gdp/economy in 4 years . 
  portugal/ireland lost 2-4 % . 
  oh i see , well that was confirmed today . 
  all the major parties except kke communist have given full backing to tsipras .
