  probably not , but joining the eurozone was a disaster, 
  the majority of greek government debt was from military spending , with a cost of 400-500 billion euros in 25 years , greece was spending 8-10 % of its gdp on military for almost 15 years . 
  on your last point , syriza was demanding a `` debt restructure '' clause in the final agreement to be held after reforms were done . 
  it had to be in the agreement itself instead of a vague `` we will talk about this after reforms '' since the previous government had a similair agreement . 
  samaras had an agreement with merkel that debt restructuring could take place after greece reforms and samaras did all the reforms he was asked , cutting the 14 % deficit to 1 % surplus and losing 30-35 % of greek gdp/economy along the way . 
  when samaras asked merkel for debt restructuring in summer 2014 she said no and this lead to syriza coming to power . 
  there is no reason to believe a vague `` we will talk about it later '' would happen after reforms , this is why negotiations broke down since syriza demanded a clause in the final agreement about debt talks after reforms were done . 
  there was no demand by syriza to restructure debt before reforms , only that a clause be made in the final agreement . 
  this is the type of propaganda that riles up hatred for both sides . 
  greeks pay 6 % lower than eu average in taxes as % of gdp . 
  . and retirement age is 62 . 
  if you spout idiotic propaganda there will be a lot of hatred for both sides . 
  also greece hasnt received any aid since august 2014 , if the debt was more manageable it could sustain itself . 
  tsipras has already paid 7 billion euros in debt while in office but is unable to pay the 20 billion euros in july/august 2015 that is owed which is the peak of greek debt for the next 5 decades . 
  i do n't understand why this debt couldnt be handled better and why it was such a huge impossible task to manage . 
  well it goes both ways , greece has been provoking germany the last few months and vice versa , greece and germany were never meant to share a currency . 
  the media in germany has been extreme anti-syriza on every tv channel/newspaper/etc so it is not surprising they have hard-line stance . 
  in the end a split from the eurozone for greece is in the best interests for both sides imo . 
  this is what most people do n't understand , a `` kick the can down the road '' bailout would only make things worse . 
  investors want stability and greece in the euro will never be stable as long as bailouts are always looming and debt is un-sustainable . 
  greece needs to revert to the drachma since it is to deep in shit with the euro and it will never ever recover with the euro now , maybe it was possible once but now it is 100 % impossible . 
  in an interview where he claimed the `` banks can open in 1 hour '' which went viral . 
  it was abandonded , tsipras was in st.petersburg last month where he signed the deal to build the `` greek stream '' pipeline which will be built with a 50/50 % russian-greek partnership and will connect to the turkish stream , with capacity of 50-60 billion cubic meters , construction begins in 6-12 months . 
  the tap pipeline also begins soon with a capacity of 50-60 and eventually 100 billion cubic meters . 
  most people here assume that tsipras has absolutely no long-term plan , but one of the cores of his long-term plan is to soon get 150-200 billion cubic meters of gas flowing through greece by 2019-2020 . 
  no , they already signed that deal last month in st.petersburg . 
  this is most likely to do with the brics . 
  he is still in parliament and will be a major force in syriza , he said he will continue in greek politics, 
  he is still in syriza and will continue in parliament, 
  varoufakis is n't resigning from syriza , he will still be in parliament . 
  what are you talking about with `` unity government '' ? 
  that is the point , it would incentivize investments to boost exports to make bigger payments every quarter . 
  it was the same deal germany received post ww2 when greece forgave there debt after murdering a million greeks . 
  it is not possible now because of party politics of eu so it will never happen . 
  greece has already gone through a fiscal adjustment the last 5 years . 
  greece 2007 going to drachmas and greece 2015 going is far different . 
  greece lost 30-35 % of its economy under troika, 
  there was a 47 page reform package, 
  or just tie payments to export surplus which syriza has tried to negotiate, 
  in 2011 , greece went bankrupt . 
  your country and others decided it was a wise idea to give a bankrupt nation the largest loan in human history . 
  this loan did not bail out greece , it bailed out the ( german/french ) banks which over-lended to greece , buying some time for your country to prepare itself for a grexit contagion . 
  [ here is an imf director of brazil and other nations talking about this . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/zjkvm6yc_za ) `` the bailouts did not bail-out greece , portugal etc . 
  so , greece comes into negotiations the last 5 months , having received no outside aid since august 2014 while re-paying massive debt payments and posting a budget surplus every quarter for 2 years and the troika put up an extreme hard-line stance to greece . 
  the day before the referendum was announced , tsipras handed in a 47 page reform package which was rejected within 60 minutes even though it covered the 8 billion in costs the troika was demanding . 
  the negotiations fell through because the troika wanted to make a lesson of syriza , and now you get posts like this thinking greeks somehow profited from this `` free money '' . 
   there 's nothing left to invest in which would increase productivity and generate a profit [ russia is starting construction of a 50 billion cubic meter gas pipeline through greece in 6-12 months ] ( http://rt.com/business/268279-russia-greece-turkish-stream/ ) and [ china is investing billions into piraeus port ] ( http://i.imgur.com/u2uhaef.jpg ) . 
  greece is the central part of china/russia [ `` silk road '' strategy ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-gosset/chinas-grand-strategy-the_b_6433434.html ) . 
  it would make sense to centralize these projects and investments within the brics . 
  at 6:50 , to paraphrase `` the bailouts did not bailout greece , portugal , etc but they bailed out the banks '' he was working for imf during this interview so this is nice to hear the truth . 
  brics bank has their opening ceremony this tuesday , should be entertaining . 
  i am more interested in july 7th [ brics bank to commence business on 7 july ] ( http://thebricspost.com/brics-bank-to-commence-business-on-7-july/ )  [ `` the prime minister thanked storchak and said he was pleasantly surprised by the invitation for greece to be the sixth member of the brics development bank . 
  ] ( http://rt.com/business/257701-greece-russia-brics-invitation/ ) tsipras said greece is interested in the offer , and promised to thoroughly examine it . 
  ( note , i am not promoting this as good/bad but honestly very interested to see what happens ), 
  greece has been in a great depression that is statistically worse than the 1920 's american great depression , and crime has gone down and greece ranked in the top 20 safest places on earth in 2014 by oecd . 
  the blood wo n't flow as much as you dream of it happening , greek people are more united and `` awake '' . 
  i would love to see your face if on tuesday greece accepts the brics offer, 
  yeh , but the propaganda against greece is `` nobody pays taxes '' as in literally not a single euro in taxes is collected like the idiot i responded to posted . 
  considering greece has posted a budget surplus , often times 3-4x the forecasted amount every single quarter for 2 years the troika should have seen that greece was on a sustainable path and could have accepted tsipras `` austerity-lite '' deal . 
  also german hyper-inflation post ww1 was mainly caused by the worldwide embargo on german products and sanctions of the economy . 
  [ greeks pay 6 % lower than eu average in % of gdp ] ( http://i.imgur.com/s7rovad.png ) lithuania has the lowest tax collection in the eu, 
  key word is was , 2 years of posting a budget surplus every single quarter ( before debt payments ) was expected by the greek negotiation team to be seen a good course by the troika and could have created an `` austerity-lite '' package like which tsipras handed in the day before the referendum was announced . 
  the previous government was already in talks for a 3rd 50-75 billion euros bailout for summer 2015 , which would have likely caused mass civil unrest . 
  [ samaras reaction when he heard the referendum results ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-t40fhjwgqky/u3a3ajioioi/aaaaaaaaoqg/its9c_fefuu/s1600/immlxj.gif ), 
  the defense minister is part of the extreme-right anel party and is in coalition with syriza , so no i very much doubt it . 
  the people who voted no are not voting to get an `` easy-life '' starting tomorrow , 60 % of the country would rather go back to the drachma and suffer austerity but as long as there is at least some hope in the future . 
  do not under-estimate how powerful hope is . 
  with eu bearucrats spouting propaganda against greece and demanding a new treaty of versailles = no hope . 
  greek austerity through currency change and massive reforms = at least some hope . 
  this vote was completely about hope and the majority of the country thinks there is greater hope long-term taking an independent path . 
  no , actually the opposite . 
  tsipras/varoufakis have been trying for months now to get an agreement where greece does not receive a single euro . 
  their stance is that since greece is in a budget surplus ( before debt payments ) , a new `` growth-plan '' based on paying the debt back using only export surplus is a win-win . 
  imagine a eu where member-states do n't punish each other for going through tough periods but actually assist each other . 
  imagine a debt plan where greece is allowed to pay back all its debt using only export surplus so it gives an incentive for foreign investment and greece grows rapidly . 
  unfortunately the powers that be in eu have decided division , propaganda , `` regime change to technocrats '' , and other insane beliefs is the right solution . 
  do you know what will happen to an eu like this ? 
  i give it 15-20 years until it is on life support . 
   send it to romania . 
  we are at least fighting corruption . 
  do you want a a medal ? 
  [ the same is happening in greece ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/06/23/arrest-warrant-against-greek-businessman-for-lagarde-list/ ) greece hasnt received outside aid since august 2014 and has payed tens of billions in debts back using budget surplus only . 
  it is for the better to receive no `` aid '' since that way only leads to a spiral of destruction , imo . 
  considering greece lost 30 % of its gdp and was paying the last 12 months through the largest `` peak debt '' period using budget surplus only it was `` living within its means '' . 
  the final straw for no deal was when troika rejected tsipras austerity/reform package in 1 hour the day before the referendum , and the package crossed around 90 % of syrizas red lines . 
  it is obvious no deal is possible , and i do n't think one will be possible in the future and it is for the best . 
  pre-2008 during the `` borrowing '' years , most of that money went to corrupt military deals , very few people actually benefited . 
  greece wo n't become a shit-hole either way after this referendum . 
  no you dont `` indirectly '' pay , greece hasnt received outside funds since august 2014 and syriza has been working off a budget surplus . 
  and no , you can not kick greece out , since a unanimous vote for suspension of membership is not possible to achieve against greece and i can assure you even the most extreme eurozone hawks would never consider such an action . 
  that was good, 
  my main point is that pre-bailouts , greek debt was owned to private bankers who over-lended and worked with the corrupt greek elite . 
  post-bailout , you have threads how `` every german pays greece 700 euros '' the debt was criminally passed from private banks and onto the shoudlers of european tax-payers . 
  greece should have been allowed to default in 2011 and prevent this from happening . 
  you do n't give a bankrupt state the largest loan in human history !, 
  the bankers won with the bailout and everyone else lost . 
  the solution which tsipras/varoufakis have been trying to get is an `` austerity-lite '' deal , the reform package eu rejected just before the referendum was announced was a complete austerity package , not as harash as the eu one and was able to get passed through greek parliament . 
  in their attempt to crush syriza with an unacceptable bailout offer , they made them much stronger now with this oxi/no victory . 
  [ total greek debt is about 330 billion euros .
