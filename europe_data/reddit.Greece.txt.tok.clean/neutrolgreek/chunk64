  246 billion of that is `` bailout funds , '' of which over 90 percent went to private banks ] ( http://www.ianwelsh.net/the-lesson-of-greece-is-that-europe-is-run-by-functional-socipaths-or-psychopaths/ ) . 
  as i ( and many others ) noted back in 2010 , greece should have defaulted then . 
  this `` problem , '' such as it is , is now almost entirely the creation of attempts to bail out private lenders who should have done their due diligence , and who deserved to lose their money . 
  another [ we should be clear : almost none of the huge amount of money loaned to greece has actually gone there . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/29/joseph-stiglitz-how-i-would-vote-in-the-greek-referendum ) it has gone to pay out private-sector creditors -- including german and french banks . 
  greece has gotten but a pittance , but it has paid a high price to preserve these countries ' banking systems . 
  the imf and the other `` official '' creditors do not need the money that is being demanded . 
  under a business-as-usual scenario , the money received would most likely just be lent out again to greece . 
  before 2011 , greek debt was owed to private banks who were facing massive losses , mainly german and french banks . 
  to prevent a contagion , they made this `` bailout '' which replaced the private bank debt and put it on the shoulders of german , french , etc tax-payers . 
  so bankers won in the end and europeans are fighting each other from the propaganda war . 
  considering 92 % of the bailout money never entered greece , the message should be sent to your local bank . 
  greece with antarctica, 
  [ some early results for districts coming in ] ( http://webtv.ert.gr/ert1-live/ ) warning , in greek language but the numbers are clear to see it appears oxi/no vote is winning by a land-slide , many districts with 60-70 % no and 20 % yes, 
  if you watch the media it is the grandma who takes 500 euros in pensions a month . 
  if you actually know the reality it is from a cabal of corrupt greek and foreign policy makers who pushed 500 billion euros worth of military equipment on greece in 25 years, 
  ok since you have all the `` fundamental '' understanding of derivatives , you seriously think deutsche bank having 55 trillion euros of derivatives on their books is a good thing ? 
  it is simply a bet , a bet that the derivative will be worth its value in the future . 
  nothing is wrong with that in itself , but the derivatives market is now so bloated and made into a massive bubble because these derivatives get divided thousands of times to increase its value . 
  it is like taking a 10 euro bill and cutting it in half . 
  does that make it now 20 euros worth ? 
  ofcourse not , but that is how derivatives work . 
  you take the original and divide it and bubble the profits up for the banks . 
  eventually it will burst , and people have been warning about this derivatives bubble as the next major economic shit-storm since 2008 . 
  derivatives on their own in a vacuum are not bad in itself . 
  the issue lies in the fact that derivatives are treated like hard currency in the markets . 
  so you have deutsche bank re-selling a single derivative thousands of times into smaller and smaller pieces so the original value of the derivative explodes but it still ( should ) have the same original value . 
  derivatives market is pure and simple gambling , gambling that makes las vegas look like a kindergarten playground and it will soon collapse , maybe not now but in 10-20 years , eventually it will since it is simply not sustainable . 
  [ deutsche bank 's derivatives position almost 15 times as large as germany 's gdp ] ( http://www.goldcore.com/us/gold-blog/deutsche-bank-ceos-shown-door-worlds-largest-holder-of-derivatives-in-trouble/ ) do you know what derivatives are ? 
  it is imaginary numbers that do not exist outside of a computer , it has no real value and germany 's entire economy is built on this mountain of derivatives . 
  if greece collapsed in 2011 it would have sent a chain reaction and sparked a domino effect on banks across europe with the final piece of it being the deutsche bank derivatives . 
  either way it is only a matter of time until this derivatives bubble bursts , and it is going to get really ugly when it happens . 
   deutsche bank 's derivatives position is truly enormous . 
  it was recently estimated to be around $ 54 trillion . 
  germany 's gdp , the fourth largest in the world , was a mere $ 3.64 trillion in 2015 . 
  were deutsche bank caught off-side in its derivatives positions there is not a government or institution on earth that could bail it out and it could lead to contagion in the german financial system and indeed in the global financial system . 
  are you seriously trying to imply germany loaned greece money out of `` goodwill '' . 
  and not the fact that the german banking system was going to collapse if greece did the smart move and defaulted in 2011 . 
  now greece is fucked for a decade because it took this `` goodwill '', 
  half of the previous government had secret swiss accounts , the main reason people voted for syriza is because they are seen as `` uncorrupted '', 
  the article says they were sitting in a media area in the middle of protests . 
  and they were not hit but other media people in that area . 
   and the socialist hellenic republic is born with tsipras as life-long president  g.p.r.h *, 
  greece doesnt need any more `` support '' , which is like giving a heroin addict another hit and brought it to this current mess . 
  syriza could not sign the ultimatum-deal the eurozone offered since it would destroy syriza party and cause political chaos and worse crisis in greece . 
  with this vote , tsipras will manage to keep control of the party from splitting ( which is the eu primary goal ) and get a deal either with the euro or drachma , one way or the other . 
  retirement age is 40 though , in your 50 's you get your second pension and then at 60 your 3rd pension . 
  it is nice for pensioners to be taking in 50,000 euros a month in pensions each . 
  [ you are assuming no cracking down of tax evasion has already taken place . 
  ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/03/24/greek-govt-to-go-after-80000-rich-tax-evaders/ ) [ right now they are working on lagarde list with 2 or more major arrests so far ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/04/22/top-greek-businessman-pays-e1-8-mln-after-arrest-for-unpaid-taxes/ ) [ one of them being metaxas owner , who is the most well known liquor producer in greece who was charged last week for tax evasion and faces life in prison ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/06/23/arrest-warrant-against-greek-businessman-for-lagarde-list/ ) the reforms have sections for fighting lower income/middle class tax evasion , [ mainly through forcing all stores to accept major purchases on credit/debit cards electronically ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/169580/article/ekathimerini/business/transactions-over-70-euros-on-larger-islands-may-be-creditdebit-card-only ) and other reforms to promote debit/credit use . 
  the rule during the negotiations was that greece could not `` unilaterally '' pass a law/reform until the entire reform package was approved a whole by the troika . 
   france and germany and some others have loaned 700 euros to the greek government for each of their citizens . 
  that would pay for a lot of tax breaks and welfare programs in our countries . 
  are we supposed to forget about that money and the good it will do because we are not yet as broke as you are ? 
  the banks should have taken their losses in 2011 instead of giving greece the largest loan in human history to a defaulted state . 
  now they have swapped that debt and loaded it onto german and french , etc citizens . 
  now greece is fucked because these loans went to complete waste , as 92 % of it never entered greece itself but went through this debt swapping scam so the bankers got away without harm . 
  the issue is not `` debt forgiveness '' , the main campaign of syriza is not to get the debt wiped away like you or some others may believe . 
  the most `` radical '' proposal they have is to get the same terms post-ww2 germany received . 
  which is to link debt payments to greek export surplus . 
  this has a two-fold advantage as not only will all the debt be paid , but in a healthy way . 
  foreign investment can begin to enter greece again since the eu would want to grow greek exports to pay back the debt even quicker . 
  imo , this is a win-win since not only is debt handled well but both greek exports and foreign investment can grow , which is exactly what greece needs right now . 
   imagine if greece had done the opposite of syriza . 
  they elected a tough anti-corruption government that was committed to the rule of law and a balanced budget . 
  varoufakis has already pledged that a core reform will be to keep a surplus `` forever '' . 
  the problem is that varoufakis/syriza want it to be a 0.5-1 % surplus and troika want it to be a 3-4 % surplus . 
  this was actually the main debate between both negotiating teams for months and possibly even brought negotiations to halt . 
  [ as far as fighting corruption , their entire campaign was based off this . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/fjp1ysx47fo?t=1m57s ), 
  does he not realize how extremely offensive statements like these are ? 
  that is what it will be , i will look for interview when he goes into details . 
  basically varoufakis has something like 15-20 ,000 employees under the ministry of finance and he wants to separate all those workers from his ministry and create a tax agency that is independent from government and only answers to the parliament . 
  edit : [ here is discussion where he talks about it ] ( https://youtu.be/6kpaf1xrbte?t=13m48s ), 
   you need austerity not as a punishment ( although you would deserve it ) but because you need to get to a point where the expenses correspond to the level of wealth the state can sustain . 
  which has already taken place . 
  that is the entire point . 
  when greece lost 30 % of its gdp in 4 years , it was the most extreme fiscal adjustment in human history , let alone in that short of a span . 
  greece has gone without outside assistance since august 2014 through the largest `` peak debt '' ( repayment ) _ period for the next 5 decades . 
  considering the fact that greece has adjusted with a 30 % decrease in gdp , and the fact that greece has been paying its debts without outside assistance for 12 months and posting a budget surplus ( before debt payments ) every quarter for the last 2-3 years . 
  it is safe to say that greece is able to sustain on its current path . 
  pensions have been slashed 50 % since 2010 so it is unfair to use those numbers also . 
  . and tsipras has already agreed to raise retirement age to 67 in october 2015 . 
  now do you want to continue the austerity to make sure the `` greeks learned their lesson '' and punish them or accept the fact that incredible sacrifices have been made ( as much as your propaganda does not acknowledge this ) and form a new growth-plan and soon closer eu or do you want to divide and try to implement a new treaty of versailles onto greece . 
  the short-term thinkers like you obviously think the punishment must continue . 
  for some ideological reason . 
  and as far as tax evasion , varoufakis talks about it all the time . 
  one of the core reforms in the package is creating a 15,000 person independent tax agency based off the irs . 
  well it is hard to compare since greece had around a 5x harsher austerity experience than portugal . 
  greece lost 30 % of its gdp , portugal lost 5-8 % . 
  greece went through the largest fiscal adjustment in modern history which closed the 14 % deficit to 1 % surplus but it ended up destroying the economy as 30 % of gdp was lost and gdp/debt soared as the denominator which was the gdp completely crashed . 
  it is not black and white either , i will not say greece has not been at fault , ofcourse it has . 
  but i do n't understand the complete inflexibility to make a good long-term deal for greece considering the circumstances of losing 30 % gdp . 
  varoufakis/tsipras have constantly proposed an `` austerity-lite '' deal with the troika and 90 % of `` red lines '' syriza made when they won office have been crossed to try to make a deal , yet the creditors want to continue harsh austerity while there is 60 % youth un-employment . 
  the creditors could make a deal like germany received post ww2 and tie debt repayments with export surplus and the entire crisis could be solved instantly . 
  . yet they have made no attempts to reach a middle ground to promote growth and at least some `` hope '' for the greeks , especially young people . 
  greece has managed to cuts its 14 % deficit into a surplus , pay back all debts since august 2014 with zero outside assistance and create a complete reform package which was rejected even though almost every single `` red line '' was crossed , there should be at least some form of compromise but this is not about debt or economy any more . 
  it is a pure political war since syriza poses a danger for the establishment eu parties . 
  i still do n't understand why varoufakis is so hated for the plan he wants to implement . 
  it is a complete 100 % copy of the same plan germany received post-ww2 .
