  i mean germany and other eu countries had no problem throwing 200 billion at the known to be corrupt and oligarch friendly nd and pasok parties the last few years , but they are taking the knives out for a 7 billion euro deal with syriza who have already formulated a plan of more reforms than the last 40 years of greek government combined . 
  syriza can not be seen to win any type of victory since if podemos wins in spain it will alter the entire landscape of eu politics and power . 
  that is the most extreme step greece would take , and only if there is a complete fallout which wo n't happen , even if greece leaves the euro currency . 
  force russia to pay for greek pensions while greeks party and refuse to pay them back . 
  its funny how people believe garbage like this . 
  the vast majority of debt was created from military spending , not pensions . 
  also there is 30 % unemployment , do you think people are happy and `` partying '' about that ? 
  just to go on about your first sentence which is true . 
  from 2005 interview with aq leadership http://www.spiegel.de/international/the-future-of-terrorism-what-al-qaida-really-wants-a-369448.html the third phase this is described as `` arising and standing up '' and should last from 2007 to 2010 . 
  ** `` there will be a focus on syria , '' ** prophesies hussein , based on what his sources told him . 
  the fighting cadres are supposedly already prepared and some are in iraq . 
  attacks on turkey and -- even more explosive -- in israel are predicted . 
  al-qaida 's masterminds hope that attacks on israel will help the terrorist group become a recognized organization . 
  the author also believes that countries neighboring iraq , such as jordan , are also in danger . 
  the fourth phase between 2010 and 2013 , hussein writes that al-qaida will aim to bring about the collapse of the hated arabic governments . 
  the estimate is that `` the creeping loss of the regimes ' power will lead to a steady growth in strength within al-qaida . '', 
  at the same time attacks will be carried out against oil suppliers and the us economy will be targeted using cyber terrorism . 
  the fifth phase this will be the point at which an ** islamic state ** , or caliphate , can be declared . 
  the plan is that by this time , between 2013 and 2016 , western influence in the islamic world will be so reduced and israel weakened so much , that resistance will not be feared . 
  al-qaida hopes that by then the islamic state will be able to bring about a new world order . 
  ** the sixth phase hussein believes that from 2016 onwards there will a period of `` total confrontation . 
  '' ** as soon as the caliphate has been declared the `` islamic army '' it will instigate the `` fight between the believers and the non-believers '' which has so often been predicted by osama bin laden . 
  greece and turkey are becoming economic allies as there is a planned 150 billion cubic meters of gas that will travel through turkey and greece in a few soon to be built pipelines , also mutual partnerships in tourism and other sectors . 
  turkey 's economy is not that strong although it has been strong the last decade , a lot of economic experts predict an economic crash there within the next 15-20 years so it is not stable enough for long-term . 
  greece economy is still posting growth even though these negotiations would have completely crippled most countries , when you have the german finance minister provoking bank runs almost daily with dangerous statements . 
  it is going to be a great shadenfreude when these events come visit your neighbors and eventually you within the next few decades . 
  german `` humor '', 
   i also think that greece will never repay the debts , and probably should not be expected to repay a lot of them . 
  the thing is greece is capable of doing it , but the measures proposed by eu/imf want to continue the great depression in greece so it is unable to . 
  summer 2015 is the biggest peak of debt for the next 5 decades and after that it becomes more managable . 
  the problem is that eu/imf can not give a `` good deal '' to syriza because they can not allow syriza a victory of any kind , even a minor one . 
  what imf/eu want to do is to create a deal in which syriza signs and then in-fighting begins within the party and it fragments into controllable smaller parties . 
  this debt is 100 % political , and absolutely nothing to do with the real situation . 
  the eu is actually attempting a coup , most will read this article and think it is sensationalized but it is not . 
  the two leaders of main opposition parties from to potami and new democracy visisted brussels this week and when they came back they made statements that the best course for greece is to form a new government without elections between nd , potami and the moderate half of syriza ( without tsipras ) and to sign a new austerity agreement . 
  i have lost all trust for the eu and everything it stands for now , it is time for extreme measures imo . 
  1 million are not public servants . 
  absolute bullshit there is currently 300,000 public servants in greece which is below average compared to most countries . 
  300,000 public servants have been fired in the last 3 years , do n't post old numbers . 
  tsipras has agreed to pension reforms , not allowing early reitrement and raising retirement age to 67 , which was the initial demand by eu/imf , but now they have changed their minds after syriza agreed to these reforms and want even more . 
  eu/imf does not want a deal that will give syriza a further chance to lead greece , they are trying to figure out any way possible to destroy syriza from within , primarily forcing them to sign an agreement which would cause internal strife and fragmentation of the various political parties within syriza . 
  that is stupid , the point was n't about the article but this quote itself which is interesting . 
   full austerity . 
  gradual austerity was a big mistake . 
  the salaries should have been reduced overnight . 
  greece had 5x larger austerity than anyone else . 
  30 % reduction in economy and 30 % unemployment is unheard of since the american great depression and 5-6 years after the great depression usa was rapidly growing while greece is still debating more austerity and more reduction in economy with more unemployment . 
  also note , this was the first visit of greek foreign minister to rom in 11 years . 
  also `` net migration '' hides the true numbers . 
  net migration = foreigners coming into uk minus british expats leaving uk ( usually retirement ) . 
  so real migration is around 400-500 ,000, 
  greece wo n't leave the eu regardless of what happens, 
  that was terrible, 
  but it is not being used for a basis , that is the point imf made clear when they torpedo 'd it and went back to their demands from last month . 
   we have no money for investments , internal industry in shambles , huge imports , ineffective agricultures , huge unemployment . 
  that is what saying in the euro will bring , as long as greece stays in the euro , unemployment will never ever get below 25 % , never . 
  this is because the euro forces every country in it to compete against each other and greece is not able to compete within the euro . 
  there is no money for investments , no industry and high unemployment because of the euro , and it will forever stay this way within the euro . 
  leaving the euro and going back to the drachma will cause a flood of investments back into greece as the currency is now at a place where people can make better and smarter investments without fear of a `` grexit '' since that is not possible . 
  there is around 300 billion euros of greek money sitting outside of greece due to the never-ending fear of `` grexit '' , and even if a deal is made i doubt it will come back since people will fear for a `` grexit ' some time in the future again and i do n't blame them . 
  with the drachma , and greece being the hub of 150 billion cubic meters of gas by 2025 and other major projects starting , unemployment could reach 15-20 % within a decade , which would be impossible if greece stays in the euro . 
  because going back to the drachma will not destroy greece , it will save it and syriza will gain the full benefit of this outcome . 
  if it was `` unreasonable '' proposals than jucnker/djiselbloem and other leaders would not be saying it was a good basis for the final deal . 
  only imf ( usa ) torpedo 'd the deal as they have their own agenda , and that is to destroy syriza as they are pro-russian . 
  the imf/eu primary goal is not for a good deal , the primary goal is to destroy syriza . 
  they believe syriza will cave in and sign any agreement which will then cause in-fighting within syriza and their splintering into manageable political parties . 
  the main reason they want syriza gone is to stop any such movements from happening in other countries , podemos in spain being the major one , and also to destroy the greece-russian increased relations that have taken place . 
  syriza signing the 50 billion cubic meter per year gas deal with russia last week , most likely put imf/eu in over-drive to seek any method that will bring down syriza . 
  i do n't think they understand that they will fail and this attempt will only make syriza stronger in the end . 
  who said anything about an agreement ? 
  it is clear now that the only option is to go back to the drachma and join the bric 's bank next month when it opens . 
   if greece goes out of the euro uncontrolled pretty much all liquidity will flee the country this has happened already , especially with the help of german finance minister making statements every day the last few weeks pushing for bank runs . 
  there is an estimated 200-300 billion euros of greek money that has fled recently , which will flood back in once the drachma comes back . 
  syriza has openly said that in case of default they will manage to use this incoming flood of euros back into the greek economy to rebuild the economy . 
  basically this current negotiation has already caused this massive euro flight out of greece , once negotiations are over either with greece in the euro or not ( preferably not ) , than hundreds of billions of euros from greeks will be coming in looking for investments and purchases . 
   you know , arresting tax evaders in-front of cameras etc which is happening daily, 
  i do n't think you understand the total hatred and mistrust the population has for those parties , at least nd and pasok . 
  nd , pasok and potami combined have around 25 % of the voter base . 
  syriza in recent polls has around 45 % . 
  there is nowwhere to pray for christians in saudi arabia , do n't post propaganda from the media wing of the saudi government . 
  its to late to ask why , as these purchases directly caused the economic debt crisis . 
  hopefully with eu federalization coming soon there is a united eu army so greece can save billions from wasteful military spending . 
  that is just for rifles , greece buys billions from usa every year . 
  [ greece just signed a 500 million contract a few months ago ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/04/05/greek-govt-signs-500-mln-contract-with-u-s-company-for-modernization-of-p-3b-orion-planes/ ) [ 40 % of greek military equipment imports are from usa ] ( http://i.imgur.com/akvwjmg.png ) , greece also has one of the largest if not the largest modern [ f-16 fleet on earth outside of usa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_of_the_european_union ) , with around 200 active modernized f-16 's , most of them block 52 +, 
  does detroit buy billions of $ worth of weapons form us every year ? 
  does n't look like regular furniture , most likely part of some occult rituals or something crazy like that . 
  elite and aristocratic russians during this time were very heavily into the occult, 
  [ reminds me of this scene in house of cards ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bnhdtfx10 ), 
  neither side wants a default and greece out of the eurozone . 
  since syriza took office , it was obvious that a `` final deal '' would be made literally at the last minute before midnight . 
  what has taken place the last few months is a political boxing match that will go down in the history books of the eu for its entertainment and insight into eu politics . 
  this week is the last minute to reach a deal and it will be made , i doubt many people are surprised that a flurry of positive statements are being made now . 
  there was always going to be a deal made , the only question is how to make a deal in which both sides look like they have `` won '' for their supporters . 
  previous governments gave away 4g/5g/television licences/etc to `` friends '' usually without charge and the state made no money from possibly very lucrative tv/networking deals , this is a good reform imo .

  edit : [ it looks like tsipras and juncker repaired their relations after a few tense comments in the last weeks ] ( http://gfycat.com/friendlynaturalbordercollie ), 
  terrible photoshop job , there are better photoshops in youtube tutorials, 
  actual deal signed by tsipras and putin, 
  the main connection for the greek stream has always been greece  italy . 
  the rom  serbia  hungary pipeline is a new extension that is being planned separate from the greece  italy connection .
