  ** island hopping ** this is what everyone comes to greece for , i suggest the [ dodekanese ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dodecanese ) islands in south-eastern aegean . 
  dodekanese are 12 major islands + 150 smaller islands in a small area , easy travel between the islands with a short boat ride you can take on each islands main harbor for very cheap . 
  i would recommend rhodes ( rodos ) and kos + any other smaller island for adventure . 
  rodos has everything , [ largest , most well preserved castle city on earth built by knights templar for one ] ( https://louiscruises.com/media_files/images/components_15/thumbs/main_rhodes-city-castle-2.jpg ) . 
  this castle city has the best daytime activities + nightlife on the island in my opinion . 
  also recommend visiting lindos beach , one of the best beaches on earth and amazing view of 2,000 + year old castle fortress while swimming . 
  kos is amazing for its capital , crazy night life . 
  last time i went there the bar streets were chaos at night time with people dancing everywhere and going nuts . 
  for some reason israeli 's love this place so its cool to party with them and if your jewish it will extra bit of fun . 
  everyone already knows about mykonos , santorini so wo n't get into that . 
  there are tons of islands to visit and explore , you can spend 500 summers in a row visiting the islands/greek mainland and you will only still have experience 1 % of its beauty . 
  if your the type looking for `` off the beaten path '' type vacation , i highly recommend visiting sparta , greece . 
  it is one of the cheapest tourist locations on earth and the mountains/nature is very different than what you would think greece is like . 
  also i recommend visiting mount olympus and hiking up there , great nature trip if you enjoy that sort of experience . 
  i am pretty sure you can also bring your tents and camp out there if you like also . 
  you do not need any professional training to climb mount olympus except for the last hundred meters to the absolute peak of the mountain .

  anybody who does not want mass 3rd world immigration = stormfront neo-nazi with swastika tattoos on their forhead and chest whos morning routine is doing the heil hitler salute 88 times we get it . 
  you believe it is racism to be against mass 3rd world immigration and do not believe europeans should be allowed to keep their ethnic identity . 
  you spend all day shouting pro-immigration and `` anti-racists '' rhetoric on top of radical left marxists talking points . 
  marxism is fascism, 
  marxists like you are clinically insane, 
  islam is not a race unless you consider indonesians and saudis to be a single race . 
  judaism is now as much of an ethnicity as a religion due to its roots and history . 
  islam is n't a race, 
  `` far-right '' the political spectrum has shifted so far radical left in sweden , that `` far-right '' means anyone who is not running as a pro trans-gay-noncis-anti-capitalist-vegeterian feminist pro-immigrant somali, 
  hard to read, 
  balkan is not a geographic term . 
  also greece is both balkan peninsula and med sea combination . 
  when i think balkan first thing i think of are ex-yugo countries, 
  i honestly wish , would make me fell less guilty wasting time here, 
  we 'll i wish there was someone better than samaras , but there is n't at the moment . 
  the youth of greece are 100x more intelligent than ever before so the future there will be better . 
  if i supported tsipras would you still call me a propagandist ? 
  i work for myself , have n't had a `` boss '' in a decade . 
  also unemployment in greece is 28 % , it is miserable . 
  stop acting like i think it 's paradise, 
  fair enough , but at least samaras is extremely capitalist instead of wanabee communist shit-heads of pasok . 
  samaras has acquired around 50-100 billion in foreign investment deals in the last 2 years alone , i doubt pasok even managed to gain 5 billion in foreign investment in their entire existance . 
  i see russia as a country not to be ever trusted , but not a threat,

  education has more to do with it than religion .

  why bring religion up when it has nothing to do with it ?

  what else . 
  keep hating on those polish migrants farage . 
  stupid motherfucker, 
  ca n't watch videos like this , turns me really depressed for the entire day, 
  it could be that usa plans to give kurds tow/atgm like they did with fsa just saw a picture of fsa and kurd alliance earlier which makes me think obama wants to use kurds against assad and will train them like they did fsa . 
  usa is playing a dangerous game with these groups right now , and as usual the long term effects will be catastrophic . 
  i think turkey 's current actions are heavily influenced by the recent move by obama to arm kurds in syria with advanced weaponry . 
  i think this is erdogan telling obama that he needs to make a choice between turkey or the kurds , but i could be wrong . 
  the kurds are the elephant in the room at the moment and they seem to be getting stronger militarily every year now, 
  i feel better now about losing to serbia . 
  http://mobile.todayszaman.com/news-322769-pyd-leader-turkey-continues-to-support-al-nusra-front-against-kurds.html most famous example is from summer 2013 , turkish agents working with al-nusra ( aq affiliate ) led a massive assault against the ancient christian village of kobani populated by armenians/kurds . 
  this was done to open a new front in syrian war after assad had gotten the upper hand in the war . 
  the aq soldiers , numbered at around 5-10 ,000 rushed kobani from within turkish border and commuted countless atrocities against the christians for no other reason than their religion . 
  i believe assad recently took back kobani and worked with armenian/greek volunteers, 
  old world countries in europe are built as a safe haven for an ethnic people . 
  they are not like usa , australia or canada which has no ethnic history and instead built on a ideology . 
  when sweden is minority swedes it will cease to be sweden , marxists like you will have to see the failures of your ideology to understand , i will never convince you, 
  which is ? 
  not wanting swedes to be a minority ? 
  that is racist to you which makes sense for a marxist fascist . 
  i also do not want too see africans or asians being minorities in their own countries, 
  when you make an anonymous internet comment it should not be . 
  they deserve privacy like anyone else . 
  owning a business does not make you a public figure also . 
  and even if it was a politician is he not allowed to have anti-3rd world immigration beliefs or is that outlawed in your utopia ? 
  when will immigration ever be enough for you fascists ? 
  when sweden is 30 % native swedish will you finally say it 's enough or must they be completely wiped out ? 
  you are fascist scum , i hope you know that . 
  leftists are no different that right fascists , only difference is the marketing and the `` why '' of silencing the opposition . 
  people like you are the loud minority , never forget that, 
  you do n't think a newspaper going to peoples door 's for making anti-immigrant comments online is a bit crazy ? 
  clickon the video and it will jump right to that part, 
  sweden `` pride comes before the fall '' you have no idea of the hell you unleashed upon yourselves , like i said many times , you can take every muslim on earth into your little socialist `` utopia '' . 
  i could not care less , the actual civilized countries are trying to improve the life of their own citizens not importt millions of foreigners and make discussing the issue as `` racist '' . 
  also swedes as usual with their brainwashing , retirement age in greece was 55 for the cancerous socialist government employees that stole anything they could . 
  the normal greek worker retired at 65 if they were lucky . 
  my aunts/unlces worked up until around 70 , and one of my uncles continued to work until 80 . 
  the only `` gutter ' is what sweden will look like in 2050 , enjoy  remember my brainwashed friend , history is young, 
  99 % of `` refugees '' are only trying to get into europe to make money , they are already in safe countries like turkey when they try to make it in europe . 
  so the answer is , yes,
