  if this continues , like i said the `` minority '' will become a majority . 
  europeans are having a crisis in birth-rates while the opposite is happening in the rest of the world . 
  if this continues in 50-100 years , europeans will be minorities within europe and then there will be true hell on earth for everyone . 
  either you put a stop to it now so we do not allow this nightmare scenario or you allow it because of politically correct brainwashed idiots like yourself are to afraid to face reality and our grandchildren wake up to world war 3 . 
  there is already signs in italy of a fascist uprising due to migration worries . 
  now imagine in 20-30 years when it is 100x worse . 
  the # 1 way to get fascists to rise in europe is to continue your bleeding heart ideology of `` let everyone in '' . 
  people like me are realist who do not want fascists to rule , you people who think you can save everyone in africa are the ones who will cause fascism to rise across europe , and i fear it is already to late because people like you control the media . 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  how do you equate not allowing millions of illegal immigrants into europe to nuking the world ? 
  this is bullshit , africa is destined to be a never-ending warzone and it will never get better , only worse . 
  as isis spreads into nigeria and other african states , water drought becomes an epidemic , wars become the norm and many other things . 
  africas population is expected to reach 5-7 billion ( nigeria alone 1 billion ) within 50 years . 
  this wo n't ever end . 
  only exponentially increase as more and more come with hopes to land in europe . 
  the minority you talk about will eventually become a majority and people like you will be responsible for what happens . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  june is a huge imf debt re-payment month . 
  [ but the biggest peak of greek debt of the next 50 years is july 19 and august 19 ] ( http://graphics.wsj.com/greece-debt-timeline/?mod=e2fb ) debt re-payment to ecb/eu that totals around 6.5 billion euros , which is unheard of as far as debt payments go . 
  . at least for a country of 10 million . 
  the imf debt is possible to overcome . 
  the eu 6-7 billion within 30 days is impossible . 
  the previous government and troika were already in negotiations last summer for a 3rd bailout for summer of 2015 with massive new austerity measures to prolong the depression another 5-10 years on top of selling off everything in greece for `` peanuts '' as varoufakis put it . 
  the [ leopard 2 hel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmtwps9ah-u ) should be exported , it is an upgraded version of the leo 2 a6 built in greece . 
  greek government needs to promote it more since i dont think most people know it exists . 
  no , he is right . 
  military spending got out of control after the cyprus invasion and directly led to the current situation . 
  [ greece spent an estimated 500-600 billion on military to acquire the largest modern air-force and tank force in europe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_of_the_european_union ) which directly led to the financial crisis . 
  i would be butt-hurt if greece lost thessaloniki which almost happened , but constantinople is basically ancient history at this point . 
  [ norway and greece ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/05/28/norway-funds-migrant-reception-center-in-greece/ ) are working together to build a refugee center in lesvos to accomdate all the illegal immigrants that are entering kos and other islands . 
  so next summer this wo n't be a problem i hope . 
  good guy norway, 
  that is a bit extreme lol, 
  nobody gives a shit, 
   obligations to `` official '' creditors such as the imf , the ecb and the governments of other european economies account for the vast majority of greece 's $ 500 billion worth of external debt , so these institutions would bear the brunt of foreign losses from a greek default . 
  foreign bank exposure to greece totals only $ 46 billion , which is widely dispersed among countries , so the direct effects of grexit on the private sector in other countries should be manageable , at least in theory . 
  of course , financial markets may react negatively if greece were indeed to leave the eurozone , and we worry that contagion could spread to other european countries . 
  the best way to reduce un-employment would be going back to the drachma , even going past this summer when debt payments become sustainable it is not like un-employment would get better . 
  going back to the drachma is the best way to attract investments and bring down unemployment . 
  taking the bric 's offer and going back to the drachma is the best option right now and both sides in the negotiations know this , the only question is whether syriza has the courage to take it . 
  http://rt.com/business/257701-greece-russia-brics-invitation/ the left platform of syriza is demanding to take this offer , it will be interesting to see what happens in the coming weeks . 
  the cost for the `` bailout '' has been 30 % un-employment , 30 % reduction to economy which is unheard of since the american great depression , and the attempted sell off of state assets for `` peanuts '' to the imf . 
  going back to the drachma and accepting the bric 's offer has a very low threshold to be considered a success , which would be around 20 % un-employment by 2020 . 
   it would seem that killing tourists in north africa makes people want to stay in europe ? 
   arivals from germany and france rose by 35.9 % and 94.2 % respectively , while arrivals from the united kingdom rose by 37.7 % . 
  finally , turning to the non-eu-28 countries , arrivals from russia fell by 66.9 % to 9,000 , while united states arrivals increased by 49.7 % to 48,000 is the fall from russian tourists due to economy getting hit ? 
  it seems like a big drop . 
  i know it doesnt mean much , but that is after debt payments which were massive in 2014 and hitting their peak in 2015 . 
  2016 + will see these payments get cut in half with some years , like 2019 for example debt payments required is 25 % of 2015 . 
  for some reason the previous governments decided to stack on a mountain of debt for 2014/2015 which is creating this current events . 
  fascism wo n't rise regardless of what happens , golden dawn has 3-5 % support syriza has around 40-50 % support right now and it would likely rise even further if greece went back to drachma . 
  40 years ? 
  what are you referring to ? 
  also , the last part is not really true if you read and understand the agreement . 
  what syriza basically is trying to negotiate is `` austerity-lite '' , the main focus of previous austerity was reducing the -14 % government deficit . 
  now it has been +1 -3 % for 3 years in a row and syriza agrees to keep it a surplus `` forever '' in their own words . 
  what they are against is cuts to the lower/middle class and instead focus their reforms on wealthy and creating an irs type agency among other things . 
  it still will not be good enough , every time syriza chooses to meet in the middle and negotiate , eu/imf make a series of new demands so i do n't expect this to gain much traction . 
   and that loan money was spent on the enormous public sector and social benefits , for years . 
  no , most of it went into the miltary sector , 500-600 billion was spent on military since the cyprus invasion . 
  [ greece has the largest modern air force and tank force in europe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_of_the_european_union ) , around 300 modern jets mostly modern f-16 and around 2,000 tanks which 90 % are leopard 2 a4/a6/hel 's and countless other military equipment like artillery , guns , etc. 
  remember that german submarine controversy ? 
  that was something like 5-10 billion euros down the drain which alone is enough to pay for pensions and public sector for months . 
  military spending was 10-15 % of gdp in the 80 's , and 5-10 % in the 90 's . 
  none of this helped greek people , yet propaganda against greece says that the average greek person benefited immensely from this over-spending like you just said right now . 
  it never did and never will help anyone other than a very few people . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  greece was in default in 2008 and thus 91 % of bailout money went to banking sector so as varoufakis puts it greece could continue to `` extend and pretend '' . 
  my initial response was made because many people , especially germans believe that 100 % of bailout money went to greece and that greek people lived luxurious lives of this `` bailout '' money . 
  the reality is that all that money went into the banking sector and then the debts were transferred onto the greek state to safeguard the eu institutions in case of grexit . 
  the only way forward is to drop the euro currency and go back to the drachma which hopefully happens this month , and take the offer to join the bric 's bank . 
  the eu/imf have shown to be a cynical group of villains in current negotiations . 
  i had no real hatred for them prior to 2015 and syriza gaining power , i thought they were doing the right thing in greece but this whole debacle has shown them to be a malicious group of cunts . 
  their entire plan to asphyxiate greece in current negotiations and then push them into 5 more years of hardcore austerity is going to back-fire very harshly for them , very very soon . 
   the greek people benefitted immensely from the government 's overspending . 
  military spending does not benefit anyone , and that is where most of that money went into . 
  around 500-600 billion $ was spent on military in 25 years for a country of 10 million . 
  the only people who benefited from it besides military were wealthy businessmen who took out massive loans and evaded taxes and were corrupt , varoufakis talks about it in that presentation i posted . 
  he explains how they built their wealth on loans the greek tax-payers paid for and then once the bubble burst in 2008 they moved all their wealth to geneva or nyc and now non-wealthy greek people have to pay for everything . 
  the problem comes when germans like to blame the normal greek lower/middle class for this crisis like merkel infamously did in 2011 or your newspapers like bild do every single day . 
  [ 91 % of bailout money never entered greece itself , as others explained to your comment it was pumped into the banking sector . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kpaf1xrbte&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=11m33s ), 
  this is bullshit because if it was the other way around and it was of ukraine pow 's with no `` proof '' , it would be allowed . 
  ( please do n't shadowban me for questioning you ), 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/groupthink russia is evil in the current group-think so this is acceptable, 
  http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/russia-invites-greece-join-brics-new-development-bank-1500901 http://rt.com/business/257701-greece-russia-brics-invitation/, 
  short-term 12-24 months most likely no , with a possibly yes if syriza agrees to get help from the brics bank . 
  long-term very much yes , the euro has no future in greece imo . 
  better to cut it off now then let it stay like a cancer . 
  it will devalue between 30-50 % , but it will also trigger a massive wave of foreign and domestic investment . 
  it will stabilize around 10-20 % below the euro around 2019-2020 once the gas pipelines are complete and by 2030 it will possibly reach parity with the euro as 120-150 billion cubic meters of natural gas is being traded in drachmas in the athens gas market . 
  so basically it will hurt for 12-24 months but it will exponentially gain value as massive investment projects begin , some we already know such as [ hellinkon developent project ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bmnlh2g_w8 ) , [ the half dozen gas pipelines in the works ] ( http://www.naturalgaseurope.com/greece-regional-gas-hub-creation-strategy-23247 ) , [ cosco deal ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/15/eurozone-greece-piraeusport-idusl5n0y60u320150515 ) . 
  but that is nothing compared the massive investment potential greece has with a devalued currency . 
  greece as is has very little investment potential with the euro since we are in competition with every single euro country for investments . 
  with the drachma it will create a snowball effect of investments . 
  [ greece has been in the `` peak debt '' for the last 9 months and is about to enter the highest point of that peak between now and august 19 ] ( http://graphics.wsj.com/greece-debt-timeline/?mod=e2fb ) , after that debt payments become 10x more sustainable . 
  the issue is that the greek economy has been strangled by both a combination of liquidity crisis due to massive payments and negotiations dragging along which has frozen all investments and growth until they are finished . 
  right now it is a game of chicken as many predicted months ago when syriza first won , as eu/imf is dangling greece off the edge in hopes it will scare syriza to sign the deal . 
  the difference is that syriza and many others are starting to believe that going back to the drachma is not only the right choice but the best choice for the long-term future of the country . 
  in a new drachma which would be devalued around 30-50 % to the euro , the stranglehold will be released and the massive investment projects can finally begin .
