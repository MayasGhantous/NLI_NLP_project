  the average greek person will not be able to afford the newest iphone for a few years until the currency stabalizes around 20 % below the euro , but un-employment will go from 30 % to 10 % in that same time and normalcy will return . 
  the biggest mistake greece made in recent history was joining the euro currency , it is better to drop it now instead or prolonging something that does not suit the country . 
   in an effort to drive down support for greece 's eu membership this has nothing to do with eu membership , it is about ez membership .

  http://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2013/aug/30/syria-chemical-attack-war-intervention-oil-gas-energy-pipelines  according to former french foreign minister roland dumas , britain had planned covert action in syria as early as 2009 : `` i was in england two years before the violence in syria on other business '' , he told french television :   `` i met with top british officials , who confessed to me that they were preparing something in syria . 
  this was in britain not in america . 
  britain was preparing gunmen to invade syria . '', 
    the 2011 uprisings , it would seem - triggered by a confluence of domestic energy shortages and climate-induced droughts which led to massive food price hikes - came at an opportune moment that was quickly exploited . 
  leaked emails from the private intelligence firm stratfor including notes from a meeting with pentagon officials confirmed us-uk training of syrian opposition forces since 2011 aimed at eliciting `` collapse '' of assad 's regime `` from within . '', 
    these strategic concerns , motivated by fear of expanding iranian influence , impacted syria primarily in relation to pipeline geopolitics . 
  in 2009 - the same year former french foreign minister dumas alleges the british began planning operations in syria - assad refused to sign a proposed agreement with qatar that would run a pipeline from the latter 's north field , contiguous with iran 's south pars field , through saudi arabia , jordan , syria and on to turkey , with a view to supply european markets - albeit crucially bypassing russia . 
  assad 's rationale was `` to protect the interests of [ his ] russian ally , which is europe 's top supplier of natural gas . '', 
   continue to be dicks trying to negotiate a better deal than `` privatize everything and destroy the middle class '' is not being a dick,

  nice troll and not relevant to thread, 
  i was n't referring to greece , but rom and serbia are very much in need of this pipeline and stopping it will likely push them to join eurasian union and allow russian military bases . 
  nato/usa has a habit of shooting first and asking questions later like in iraq/afghanistan . 
  they toppled saddam and gadaffi and now we have isis forming a country bigger than most european ones and isis controls large parts of libya . 
  they under-estimate the cause and effect of their actions . 
  either way the greek  italian section will be done . 
  if nato wants to make balkan countries suffer in their games then there will be geo-political consequences . 
  i feel the same way about athens , it is nice to visit the acropolis for an afternoon but there is so much better regions . 
   they wo n't survive that time without financial help from germany . 
  if greece can get past august 19 , then greece will survive without any need for outside assistance ever again . 
  the previous governments have stacked debt re-payments into a `` peak debt '' between now and august 19 with 3 billion owed on july 19 and another 3 billion owed on august 19 which is ( i think ) un-heard of in debt re-payment schemes . 
  greece has already survived since august 2014 without any outside assistance and to top it off while being strangled by these negotiations which have put into a coma all the development projects and investments that were going on until after negotiations are done . 
  after august 19 , debt scales down to very sustainable levels for the next 50 years , with some years being almost 80 % smaller then debt re-repayments in 2015 . . for example in 2019 , total debt re-payment is around 3-5 billion , compared to 30 billion in august 2014 - december 2015 . 
  with the addition of massive infrastructure and investment projects starting up and the beginning of the greek energy sector which syriza is hedging to push greece into large growth , then all will be fine without `` assistance '' .

  of course it can , that is why syriza is backing it and promoting it as an `` example of privatization done right '', 
   lol , greece has started the sale of the pir\u00e4us harbor again varoufakis was literally promoting this deal the day after syriza won , they were playing hardball to strike a better deal including minimum investment ( 300 million ) and deals for pensions , minimum wage , etc. 
  this privitization is how it is supposed to be done , [ a deal which transforms piraeus into the global hub of chinese products ] ( http://i.imgur.com/c2jk8yq.jpg ) and gives greek shippers a never-ending supply of work . 
  bad privatization = selling water and energy companies who then raise the price for locals . . there is a big difference . 
   switzerland offered athens help to identify bank accounts from greek oligarchs that were hiding money in switzerland and tsipras government is n't doing anything about it . 
  you got it wrong , swiss will not hand over anything unless there is a trial against the perpetrator , which complicates things . 
  starting from 2019 , new rules will be made that all swiss accounts will be known to governments . 
  [ swiss banks will not release information on suspected greek tax cheaters ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/03/27/swiss-banks-will-not-release-information-on-suspected-greek-tax-cheaters/ )  according to swiss legislation , banks are not obligated to provide information on depositors , unless they have been prosecuted for money laundering . 
  this makes it prohibitive for the greek authorities to substantiate cases of suspected tax evasion .

  [ `` january elections called because gov ' t was unable to pay wages in february '' ] ( http://www.tovima.gr/en/article/?aid=703609 ) alternate finance minister mardas revealed 452-million-euro shortfall - staikouras `` confirms '' his allegations elections were triggered by parliament because greece was on the verge of a chaotic bankruptcy and was going to very likely need a 3rd 100-200 billion bailout !, 
  you do n't think germans and other europeans would be angry at this ? 
  i really do n't understand the propaganda you get up there . 
  on the one hand you had the previous government which fucked everything up and was not putting through real long-lasting reforms other than cuts . 
  then you have syriza who have managed to not only stay afloat using extreme measures but refuse another bailout , yet they are the bad guys . 
  the facts are simple . 
  . the previous government had not done a single positive reform regarding oligarchy , corruption , tax evasion , etc but they did follow every single rule when it came to massive cuts to workers , pensions , wages , healthcare and were ready to hand over water and energy infrastructure for `` peanuts '' . 
  syriza has managed to not only create a blueprint of massive reforms against oligrachy and corruption but have stopped the firesale privitizations and are doing things greek people have been requesting for many years now and that is to fight the oligarchy and corruption . 
  the truth is simple . 
  playing the `` good student '' to germany which the previous government did wonderfully achieved nothing . 
  when samaras turned the deficit from -14 % to +3 % surplus he did so with a backroom deal with merkel that there would be a debt re-negotiation , which obviously never happened . 
  there is no longer going to be a this subordinate role for greece in the eu where there is a government in place which follows orders and keep their mouths shut . 
  your analogy that greece is not holding any cards could not be further from the truth . 
  greece only has to ask and it can receive tens of billions from the bric 's bank and start an economic war between eu and bric 's . 
  there is never going to be another lap-dog greek government ever again , you should get used to it instead of throwing around pointless arguments like you just did .

  this is how privatizations are supposed to be done . 
  the airport deal will bring in massive investments from germany , and there is a good chance germany transforms these airports into private jet hubs alongside commercial airlines , as private jet hubs are very much needed . 
  both excellent privatizations , selling a water company who will invest nothing and only raise the price to locals is the wrong way to do privatization which was going to happen under the previous government . 
  [ imf and water privatization cases are infamous ] ( http://www.alternet.org/story/84145/latin_america%3a_why_there%27s_a_water_crisis_in_the_most_water-rich_region )  in 2004 , the uruguayan government 's negotiations with the international monetary fund ( imf ) threatened to put the water system under private management . 
  but the citizens ' campaign forced the government to adopt a constitutional amendment guaranteeing management would remain in the hands of the state and declaring water access a human right . 
  similar amendment efforts on the right to water have now emerged in colombia , ecuador , el salvador , and mexico . 
  [ 2nd example ] ( https://www.globalpolicy.org/social-and-economic-policy/global-public-goods-1-101/46052-the-struggle-for-latin-americas-water.html )  the nudge towards water privatization in mexico provides yet another alarming example of how governments , the international financial institutions and private water companies work in concert , with little regard for public well-being . 
  the government of mexico , along with others in the global south , is laying the groundwork for the corporate takeover of the country 's water system . 
   as a result , the past decade saw 20 % of mexico 's water system privatized . 
  the main corporate players have been the two leading french-based water giants , suez and vivendi , along with u.k.-based united utilities and the spanish company agua de barcelona . 
  for these corporations , the prime targets for takeover have been water services in larger tourist areas and urban centers , leaving the smaller , less populated and less lucrative municipalities to governmental stewardship . 
  3rd example - [npr.org ] ( http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyid=906163 )  the world bank and international monetary fund urge developing nations to turn their water utilities over to private companies . 
  opponents say water is a basic human need and should not be sold for profit . 
  npr 's kathleen schalch reports . 
  [ 4th example ] ( http://academic.evergreen.edu/g/grossmaz/vanovedr/ )  currently there is a rush to privatize water services around the world . 
  the world bank and international monetary fund ( imf ) are pushing for the privatization of water services by european and u.s.-based companies . 
  they are pushing privatization through stipulations in trade agreements and loan conditions to developing countries . 
  these privatization programs started in the early 1990 's and have since emerged in india , bolivia , chile , argentina , nigeria , mexico , malaysia , australia , and the philippines , to name a few . 
  in chile , the world bank imposed a loan condition to guarantee a 33 percent profit margin to the french company suez lyonnaise des eaux while the company insisted on a margin of 35 percent . 
  i doubt anyone cares , it is just something i have been saying for months . 
  syriza is hedging a lot of future growth and gdp into the energy sector with multiple pipelines ( 150 billion cubic meters by 2030 ) , lng shipping and gas well ( aegean/ionian ) projects in the works . 
  greece under the previous government was commiting `` firesale '' privatizations ( according to varoufakis ) and had a list of energy companies ready to sell just before syriza took office . 
  there is no disagreement with public sector or mass layoffs , those have already taken place with over 300,000 fired during previous government .
