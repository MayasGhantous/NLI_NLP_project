  the main differences are in pension reforms and privatization . 
   syriza is not fond of sending people to jail for small amounts . 
  this means that up to x amount , the state has not leverage for forcing payment on time . 
  well that is a good thing , it would be terrible to be sent to jail for 5,000 euros . 
  . but 50,000 + euros would make sense, 
  i thought the point of irs was to force collection though ? 
  they have the power to basically sentence you to very long prison terms and massive fines . 
  that re-payment program was in two phases , late february-early march and again late april and will end in next 2 weeks . 
  [ after that they will start confiscating properties for those who did not apply for the re-payment plan ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/04/21/greek-govt-will-move-to-confiscations-for-large-scale-debtors-not-signing-up-for-repayment-programme/ ) as far as future tax cheats and delaying payments , [ varoufakis talked about his plan to prevent that this week ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kpaf1xrbte&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=13m42s ), 
  even though these are great deals for both greece and the privateers , bringing in billions of euros of investment into shipping and airport infrastructure , these concessions will still not be good enough for eu/imf . 
   it 's `` definite '' that greece wo n't proceed with selling other state assets on a list that had been agreed on by the previous government such as water companies , the post office or public power corp ( energy ) , stathakis said . 
  `` we 're trying to work on a different model than privatizing to attract capital and investment such as for the country 's railways and other ports '' and greece is looking at `` alternative options to 100 percent privatization . ''  in case you were wondering why eu/imf were outraged at syriza winning office , the fact that they got blocked from buying up critical state infrastructure such as water and energy is the main reason negotiations have been so tense . 
   the right started fighting the left when clearly the problem was and has always been right down the center in front of everyone . 
  a unified movement against the oligarchy and corrupt politicians is what 's needed . 
  you just described why and what syriza was voted for, 
   bailing greece out despite the refusal to implement austerity ( which is an appalling precedent for other struggling euro nations ) . 
  greece has had the most austerity than any other nation , it got hit the worst by the euro crisis . 
  30 % of the economy got wiped out when troika said 5 % maximum . 
  austerity reforms were done which is why greece went to -15 % deficit to 3 % surplus in 3-4 years but with 25-30 % un-employment . 
  syriza could easily get the remaining 7-8 billion euros from 2011 agreement and also make another 100 billion 3rd bailout , but it would just continue the cycle , which is why current negotiations are happening . 
  oil is oil, 
  thessaloniki port is the main hub of your economy and greece is responsible for your air security under nato law , there are good relations between the country 's and also there is a pipeline under construction soon . 
   greece however has embraced their 20th century era fascism and superiority complex . 
  syriza is the most left-wing party in eu at the moment, 
   there is no bad bank , no eu-funding ( junker plan does not apply for greece ) , no development bank yes , i think his long-term goal in european politics will be to work on these things for the next few decades , this does not apply to current crisis which is why i assume the audience was not to amused . 
  that flowchart/lecture has nothing to do with the current reforms , this is an overall lecture based on a book he wrote a few years ago . 
  now he just gets a much better stage to present his ideas . 
  the infrastructure is there which is one of the main points of this book/lecture , all he is doing is re-working the existing treaties and institutions to a different model that promotes investment and stability in both each nation and the eurozone as a whole . 
   gardening leave [ what i like to imagine this means ] ( http://everythingaboutgardening.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/gardening-1-2.gif ), 
  i think people went into the presentation thinking varoufakis would list all the reforms in detail he has planned , but instead they received a lecture by a professor on a certain topic they were not that interested in . 
  the reforms are something that is being worked on every hour of the day , i do n't think varoufakis can really get into that many details since it changes so often , he said himself that `` every half hour '' there are negotiations being made . 
  ( in video below ) [ varoufakis had a good talk on reforms when he was in germany a few days ago ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kpaf1xrbte&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=13m42s ), 
  those are t-bill auction/roll-overs , not eu/imf repayments so nothing to worry about . 
  [ the major hurdle will be july 19 and then again on august 19 ] ( http://graphics.wsj.com/greece-debt-timeline/?mod=e2fb ) with a few imf payments between now and july 19 . 
  after that , greece is past the `` peak debt '' and everything becomes more sustainable . 
  you can go through that entire website to see each debt payment required for the next 50 years . 
  [ `` from mid-august ( 19 ) greece factually has no commitments for interest payments ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_11/03/2015_548101 ) ... for the rest of the decade and so one just has to get past the months of april , may , june , august and then the situation should be stabilized sustainably , '' - president of euro working group, 
  this is pretty surprising , most people said there would be no statement about progress in the eurogroup meeting, 
  most people who do n't know what syriza is attempting to do will be for grexit , others who understand their goal will most likely not be for it . 
  [ varoufakis had a good discussion in front of a german audience about syriza 's reform goals two days ago ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kpaf1xrbte&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=13m42s ) he also talks about grexit at 28 minute mark [ here he talks about how syriza can easily agree to `` extend and pretend '' to receive the remaining 8 billion of 2011 bailout agreement ] ( https://youtu.be/6kpaf1xrbte?t=23m36s ) , but they refuse to do so . 
  [ `` 91 % of bailout money went into banking sector '' ] ( https://youtu.be/6kpaf1xrbte?t=11m16s ) [ talks about reforms such as creating an irs type institution ] ( https://youtu.be/6kpaf1xrbte?t=13m42s ) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/internal_revenue_service, 
  [ greek tax-evaders have a few weeks left to apply for debt settlement plan otherwise government will begin confiscation procedures of 13,000 legal entities and 10,500 individuals `` utilities , industries , 60 shipping companies , football businesses , commercial enterprises and others . '' ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/04/21/greek-govt-will-move-to-confiscations-for-large-scale-debtors-not-signing-up-for-repayment-programme/ ) we should start hearing about this by the end of may/june . 
  that is not to say the 500 richest families are tax-evaders but there are over 10,000 wealthy individuals who are . 
  [ bulgaria will file a complaint to the european commission about greece 's decision to impose a 26 percent tax on cross-border transactions between the neighbors , the government in sofia said on wednesday . 
  ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_08/04/2015_548950 )  more than 1,400 greek companies registered in bulgaria , as well as bulgarian companies exporting products to greece will be affected by the measure aimed at reducing corporate tax avoidance , according to the bulgarian government , which says the new tax is `` discriminatory . ''   the greek parliament last month introduced the withholding tax on greek business transactions originating in cyprus , ireland and bulgaria , all of which have lower corporate tax rates than greece . 
  this is a clear provocation,

  most likely 20-25 euros for each winner, 
  the people building it do - http://www.naturalgaseurope.com/turkish-stream-targets-december-2016-23606 i have no opinion if it is true or not, 
  the crazy thing is that the [ azerbaijan  greece pipeline is already a done deal ] ( http://www.offshoreenergytoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/trans-adriatic-pipeline-tap.jpg ) , not only is it under contract but it already fucking began construction . 
  why are they `` offering '' something that is already done and over with ? 
  greece has signed a contract to transport 10 billion cubic meters per year of azerbaijan gas by 2020 , and it is already under contract with 2 billion being sold to bulgaria and will be transported through the igb ( greece  bulgaria ) pipeline , 1 billion to be used within greece and 7 billion sold to italy . 
  . already under contract . 
  azerbaijan is also teaming up with iran ( # 2 gas reserves on earth ) and the [ tap/tanap pipeline system is expected to bring up to 60 billion cubic meters of gas through greece by 2030 ] ( http://www.naturalgaseurope.com/southern-gas-corridor-balkans-23461 ) as expansion lines are added to the initial 10 billion cubic meter pipeline . 
  what in the hell is usa offering exactly ? 
  all of this stuff is already long done . 
  the previous government would have followed these orders and bent the knee , not going to happen with syriza though . 
  also what do they expect greece to do in reality ? 
  russia is building the turkish stream pipeline to be complete in december 2016 . 
  greece is agreeing to build the greek stream pipeline to connect the turkish stream with eu markets . 
  if usa has a problem then they can bring it up with turkey , it is not like there is a direct greece-russia pipeline . 
  it is going to be the greek stream pipeline connected to the turkish stream which is the actual russian section of the pipeline . 
  the system is so rigged that it obviously did n't matter . 
  ukip got 13 % of the total votes and got one fucking seat . 
  to put that into perspective labour got a little over double that and received 232 seats . 
  your system is completely fucked . 
  the majority of ethnic scots voted for independence and non-scots all voted to stay in the union . 
  . hopefully this wo n't cause tensions . 
  miliband is like the real life version of mr.bean . 
  . i will miss his antics, 
  can you explain further , i do n't know much about the views of each party . 
  another hit-piece against syriza by ft full of half-truths . 
  first the previous government fired over 300,000 public state workers , syriza is not going to re-hire 300,000 workers . 
  they signed a legislation taht opens the way to re-hire 13,000 workers over the next few years . 
  many of these workers were fired even though they were needed in crucial roles such as cleaning and other services , most of them low-paying minimum wage jobs . 
  while syriza plans to fire many of the high-paying public state workers who are not as useful to pay for these low-paying workers . 
  the only confirmed re-hiring 's is of 600 cleaning ladies for this year who have been at the focal point of syriza campaign before they got elected . 
  this article makes it seem like syriza is abandoning all reforms , but this is just another one of the countless anti-syriza articles ft have made , their blatant support for nd/pasok corrupt parties is very clear in other articles also . 
  i wonder who the hell is paying these shills for these articles . 
  just your usual champagne socialist , he describes himself as a `` cosmopolitian '' whatever the fuck that means . 
  he lives in an area where the cheapest home is probably 10 million euros and he only sees non-europeans while driving quickly past them . 
  but he is 100 % for opening up the borders , why would he care . 
  . he does not have to deal with the consequences . 
  never heard of it , ca n't find any stream anywhere either to watch it :\\, 
  the closest that i can find is maybe this movie [ attenberg ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2582qyfxoss ) , it is an indie-greek movie from 2-3 years ago about a village girl . 
  i particularly like it for its `` coming of age '' story and cinematography of greek landscape .

  relax sch\u00e4uble ( actually sch\u00e4uble is very reasonable , you are just an idiot ), 
  its hard to say , it was one thing having an `` idea '' of what the red lines are and i am sure they did have an idea . 
  but it is a completely different thing to have sent a massive team of specialists to athens to find the exact red lines to the smallest details and numbers . 
  my previous point was that the red lines are very defined now as the technical talks made significant progress between technical teams of brussels and athens . 
  now that it is handled the political negotiations can take a bigger step forward . 
  there really was progess though , almost all the major players are quoted to have said something along the lines of `` progress has been made/more efficient talks/etc '' . 
  even shauble is quoted and he is the most hardline negotiator .
