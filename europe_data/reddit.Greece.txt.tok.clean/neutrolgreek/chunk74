  the brussels group were in athens the last few weeks and just left yesterday i believe and significant progress was made , as to the technical details and where each side stands and what the red lines are . 
  knowing exactly what the red lines are now can now set the stage for the real deal to be made soon as both sides know where each side stands and what to negotiate . 
  [ this is the 2nd run of this program , in previous one 147 million was collected in 2 weeks ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_01/04/2015_548747 ) [ this current application opening to settle debts has a few weeks left then greek state will begin confiscation procedures on major debtors who refused to apply ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/04/21/greek-govt-will-move-to-confiscations-for-large-scale-debtors-not-signing-up-for-repayment-programme/ ), 
  each side now knows exactly where they stand and what the red lines are , which is the one positive thing , which is why there was quotes by both sides of `` progress '' . 
  they now have to meet in the middle of these `` red lines '' which will be done over the next 2 months . 
  one example is pension cuts which eu is demanding . 
  syriza will not allow pension cuts on the low end of receivers which is around 600 euros a month . 
  those are the red lines for each side . 
  but syriza minister is quoted as saying last week that they are open to deep pension cuts for the higher end receivers who take in 2-3 ,000 euros a month , so they will likely cut those down . 
  in the end there will be a deal but there is still a lot of negotiating to be done . 
  those `` few dozen '' have built a state from syria/iraq that is larger than most european countries . 
  amazing what a `` few dozen '' extremist can do .

  3,400 in 24 hours . 
  i got downvoted to the abyss a few weeks ago for saying that illegal migration is exponentially growing every year . 
  in 2011/2012 , italy would receive 3,400 illegals in a 2-3 month period , now it is 24 hours . 
  you want to seriously visit all those places in 2 weeks ? 
  i do n't blame her for not wanting to go , that is more of a business trip than a vacation , since you will be on planes , cars , trains more than anything else . 
  instead of visiting 100 places , you could just try to visit one and have a blast . 
  i would recommend going to greek islands if you are young and want to party , [ somewhere like mykonos ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qnrcsjhc3m ) and from there you can visist other greek islands,

  expats = non-financial related migration usually post-retirement with no desire of assimilating immigration = economic migration to raise a family with desire to assimilate eastern european immigrants to uk are considered immigrants not ex-pats , this article is just more of the same `` outrage culture '' that idiots are clinging to . 
   meanwhile , are greeks better now than during the past greek government ? 
  i think the most important difference between nd and syriza right now is that the previous government was planning to take a 3rd 100 billion euro bailout this summer which would have been the final nail in the coffin for greece imo . 
  [ greece is entering a 3 month period in which the `` peak of debt '' of the next 5 decades will cause a massive strain ] ( http://graphics.wsj.com/greece-debt-timeline/?mod=e2fb ) , new democracy was never going to prepared for such a task . 
  the troika would have given new democracy the final 8 billion loan tranche from the 2nd bailout in february and then planning the 3rd bailout this summer which would have come with massive privatization demands . 
  syriza has still not received the 8 billion from the 2nd bailout and is currently 100 % opposed to a 3rd bailout as part of their core party principles . 
  considering the massive reforms that are being worked on right now that hte previous government would not touch such as fighting corruption and tax evasion then i think greece is much better off with syriza than the new democracy/pasok oligarch party . 
  [ syriza right now is debating into the weekend this 1st tranche of reforms regarding corruption , tax evasion and economy ] ( http://www.tovima.gr/en/article/?aid=699168 ) . 
  . why did the previous government in all these years not consider any of these simple and logical reforms ? 
  [ they have big plans for piraeus ] ( http://i.imgur.com/m1kr6at.jpg ) from what i last read on this deal , syriza wants to make a few changes to the previous draft of the agreement of new democracy . 
  instead of 67 % of port , they will sell 51 % majority and give 16 % to the locals/state . 
  also an agreement for minimum wage , pensions , investments . 
  i think tsipras is going to beijing this month to finalize this deal . 
  [ and they agreed to build the ship repair facility in salamina ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_30/03/2015_548664 ), 
  it was going to go down the drain regardless since an oligarch mafia was running greece for 30 years in pasok/nd , the euro just accelerated the process . 
   fraport is a german company , partially owned by a german state [ it is 51 % majority german state owned ] ( http://www.fraport.com/en/investor-relations/the-fraport-share-/basic-data-shareholder-structure.html ) , i do n't see what is that controversial with the title, 
  i do n't really see what is that controversial fraport is 51 % german state owned company http://www.fraport.com/en/investor-relations/the-fraport-share-/basic-data-shareholder-structure.html the sale of these airports and of cosco to germany and china have been major issues/talking points of the current negotiations, 
  spending for this year is below 2 % for the first time since greece joined nato . 
  in the 80 's military spending was up to 10 % of gdp and during the 90 's it was 5 % . 
  that is also the official numbers and does not include the `` shadow spending '' that is known to have happened . 
  [ `` since the 1974 turkish invasion of cyprus , greece has spent an estimated $ 216bn ( 300 bn $ ) on armaments , although i am 100 % certain that in absolute terms its defence expenditure is much greater than official documents would show due to the so-called secret funds the state has access to , '' said katerina tsoukala , a brussels-based security expert . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/19/greece-military-spending-debt-crisis ) the spending was somewhere between 500-600 billion, 
  the previous government did very little if at all to really get at the source of the problem . 
  they were good at cutting costs i will give them that which is why greece managed to go from -14 % deficit to 2-3 % surplus in 3-4 years . 
  they followed everything the troika demanded of them , [ which is why greece was ranked # 1 in reforms by oecd in 2014 ] ( http://coppolacomment.blogspot.com/2015/02/reforms-bloody-reforms.html ) . 
  [ firing of 300,000 public sector workers is one example of the reforms they pushed through ] ( http://www.thepressproject.net/article/65958/the-dramatic-reduction-in-the-greek-public-sector-277095-positions-axed-in-three-years ) they were good at cutting , firing , and dismantling the state but had no plan for taxes , corruption , bribery , etc. 
  there are already a lot of positive signs that syriza is very keen to make vast changes which the previous government were not . 
  [ syriza is currently debating in parliament this first tranche of reforms regarding taxes , bribery , corruption which they hope will escalate talks with eu ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/04/28/greek-govt-tables-new-omnibus-bill-to-expedite-negotiations/ ) [ another link with updated list of reforms which entered debate last night ] ( http://www.tovima.gr/en/article/?aid=699168 ) [ the fact that they are ready to start confiscating properties of debtors is a huge step also ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/04/21/greek-govt-will-move-to-confiscations-for-large-scale-debtors-not-signing-up-for-repayment-programme/ ), 
  greeks have one of the lowest household/private debts in the western world if not the lowest , the average greek family owns a single mini-car that is very fuel efficient which they keep for 15 + years and a home passed down generations . 
  nobody i know lived lavish lifestyle . 
  the fact that greece spent 600 billion on military spending in 25-30 years is what caused the current crisis , in comparison much wealthier northern european countries barely spent a fraction of that on military during the same time period . 
  rampant corruption in the political sphere , specifically the military sector caused the current mess . 
  not the `` lavish lifestyle '' . 
  the one thing i have learned from this crisis is that european media is on russian state tv levels of propaganda . 
   one of the things i dislike most about some greek comments is them pointing the finger at germany or the eu instead of being pissed off at their own government and asking for more , not just political show , asking for robust measures to tackle their rampant corruption and tax dodging . 
  where do you see comments like that ? 
  you realize that greece destroyed the two party system that led up to the current crisis right ? 
  new democracy and pasok which ruled greece for 30 years is now basically done for . 
  the only complaints i have seen against germany in r/europe form greek redditors is that merkel and other politicians fully backed and supported new democracy even though they are the ones who created this mess while syriza are the ones actually trying to defeat corruption . 
  [ just in the last 24 hours syriza announced that they will escalate and priortize the lagarde list and siemens scandal corruption cases ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/05/01/siemens-lagarde-list-cases-to-be-given-priority-treatment-in-greek-parliament/ ) which new democracy and pasok did everything in their power to prevent from going to trial . 
  i get annoyed by comments like yours that see everything in black and white and accuse others of doing what you just did . 
  it depends on how much investment will be poured into them . 
  1.2 billion is cheap but not if there is a minimum investment of 2-3 billion to modernize them . 
  i assumed nobody knew what fraport was and most knew that cosco was a chinese state company , i should have clarified in title . 
  no i am not , i oppose golden dawn and everything they stand for and i support the syriza/anel coalition . 
  my 1st comment has to deal with the fact that pegida are represented as fascist monsters by international media for warning people about dangers such as this failed terrorist plot . 
   fascistoid what ? 
  is pegida a fascist movement ? 
  i do n't think it is unless you have information i do not . 
  but remember , pegida are the evil guys not these people trying to use pipebombs and automatic rifles on children during a bicycle race .

  i think on thursday it will be, 
  this is the 1st part of the overall reform package that has been in the works since syriza took office in january . 
  the hope is that this 1st reform package bill targetting tax evasion , receipt lottery , etc will boost confidence before more reform bills are made .

   current government plans to scrap reforms and therefore can not receive further bailout money . 
  this is a myth , they do not plan to scrap reforms . 
  the goal of syriza is to shift reforms from being targeted towards the poor/middle class such as pension/wage cuts and instead make reforms that target upper middle class and wealthy as well as lower middle class .

  the previous government did not even come close to doing such reforms . 
   it is just greece that is refusing to reform [ yup , that is why oecd ranked greece # 1 in reforms ] ( http://coppolacomment.blogspot.com/2015/02/reforms-bloody-reforms.html ) the previous government not only did all the reforms the troika demanded but far exceeded them in almost every quarter . 
  300,000 public workers were fired for example , and government surplus ( before debt payments ) was the best in europe in 2014 . 
  that is not one-time , it was just the start . 
  syriza collected 500 million in tax debt from greek citizens and are aiming for 1.5-2 billion more by the end of 2015 . 
  in 30 days they will begin confiscation procedures on greek citizens , mostly wealthy who have not applied for the debt settlement plan , this includes dozens of shipping companies , corporations , businesses , etc. 
  his real name is hans varoufakisteiger, 
  to be fair , that is a really nice cross, 
  there is no such thing as bad publicity before syriza , varoufakis was a little known figure who had been famous for working at valve and writing a successful book on economics and austerity and doing a few university lectures . 
  after syriza he is a world famous economist , `` bad boy '' and rebel who `` fought against the powers that be '' varoufakis is in the exact situation he wanted to be in,
