   greece lived well above its means for many years the average family never did , in fact greeks are one of the highest savers and least indebted nations on earth in household/private debt . 
  public debt is the issue , this is the government spending that went out of control from a cabal of corrupted oligarchs at the top . 
  greece spending 500-600 billion on military over 25-30 years is what caused this current crisis . 
  not the average greek family who never owned more than a single mini-car their entire lives and a home passed down from generations . 
  do n't underestimate the tsunami of anti-farage propaganda, 
   have they done any serious reforms or anything ? 
  yes and no the eu/troika has a `` red line '' during current negotiations that syriza can not pass any single reforms regarding tax collection , banking , economy , public sector , etc as they are demanding greece must pass a single eu approved package of all reforms , which now stands at around 30-35 total major reforms . 
  there is one exception to this rule but otherwise syriza has their hands tied . 
  tax settlement of past dues - greeks who owe the state money were given a chance over the last 30 days to pay their past debts in either one large sum or in 100 payments over the next few years . 
  it has managed to collect 500 million already and expected to get around 500-1 billion more by the end of the year . 
  this program ends in a few weeks and syriza fired a warning shot to all the wealthy tax evaders who are still resisting to use this program .

  i did n't mean to offend danish , but i can see why my comment was a bit rude . 
  my comment was more about how the french are painted in such an extreme negative light for their role in ww2 and the norweigans forgotten role in ww2 than insulting the danish resistance . 
  i will tell my cousin to give free beach chairs to germans if that counts .

   the first paratrooper invasion happened in he netherlands . 
  [ i am not sure , just from what ive read here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_crete )  the battle of crete was unprecedented in three respects : it was not only the first battle where german paratroops ( fallschirmj\u00e4ger ) were used on a massive scale , but also the first mainly airborne invasion in military history , [ 8 ] the first time the allies made significant use of intelligence from the deciphered german enigma code , and the first time invading german troops encountered mass resistance from a civilian population . 
  because of the heavy casualties suffered by the paratroopers , adolf hitler forbade further large-scale airborne operations . 
  however , the allies were impressed by the potential of paratroopers and started to build their own airborne formations . 
  well it was the right move in the end , germans had to post-pone operation barbarossa by 3 months so instead of early spring they launched invasion of soviet union in late summer and then were caught by an early september russian winter without winter clothing . 
   it would n't have mattered anyway , you simply would n't have had any chance of fending off the wehrmacht . 
  you do n't think other countries faced this dilemma ? 
  when greece just finished decimating the italians in 300 days of guerilla warfare in epirus mountains they were told to surrender by the wehrmacht or face a full-scale blitzkrieg . 
  greeks decided to fight and after 300 days of fighting italians , still put up a 30 day fight against the wehrmact and even faced the first paratrooper invasion in history , followed by a massacre of greek civilians . 
  danes are famous for surrendering to a nazi motorcyclist while norweigans fought a stiff resistance for 70 days . 
  the french fought hard for close to 30 days and yet they are stereotyped in negative way for ww2 . 
  this makes no sense syriza has basically declared war against wealthy , since 90 % of them are tax evaders and got very wealthy from evading taxes all these years .

  syriza is not against wealthy people who play fairly and do n't evade taxes , this article makes it seem like syriza is doing all wealthy people a favor , in reality it is for those who have been playing fairly and will pay their taxes and not be leeches . 
  all those statistics `` and stuff '' is a joint greek-eu thing now .

   greece needs a system of automatic tax collection so that it cant ramp up so much outsanding tax again and to make the government income more reliable aswell . 
  i think a few reforms in the current package deal with this , also varoufakis released a statement yesterday that likely deals with what you said . 
  [ `` the government has proposed to set up an independent tax commission '' ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/04/24/yanis-varoufakis-greece-is-now-ready-for-big-compromises/ ), 
   what i find worrying is the further decline in tax revenue . 
  tax collection crashed in january/february when syriza gained power as many were expecting a new tax policy which ended up coming in late february/march and it recovered significantly . 
  i said `` potential '' , nobody knows the amount in greek waters since it has never been explored thoroughly . 
  greece signed a contract last week with russian gas explorer to do research , for now mainly around crete which is believed to have gas/oil reserves . 
  the gas/oil in the aegean/ionian sea is not my point though , that is just the tip of the iceberg . 
  greece is currently in the process of building 2 major pipelines to connect greece with 120-160 billion cubic meters of gas from russia , azerbaijan , iraq , iran , etc. 
  and 2-3 minor pipeline networks that will connect greece to the balkans and italy for connection to eu . 
  brussels is currently in the planning stages of building a gas market headquarters in athens which will be used to manage all this gas flowing into greece . 
  greece also has the largest lng shipping fleet on earth , around 20-25 % of total vessels which is connected to the energy infrastructure/companies . 
  the aegean/ionian gas reserves will be nice if they come to fruition but that would be a nice bonus to the overall strategy . 
   i do believe there is real fear about moral hazard should greece get preferential treatment without reforms . 
  that is not even close to the case , since day 1 when syriza gained office they openly said they support 70 % of the reforms but are against 30 % , that 30 % of reforms is what has been stalling a deal from being made . 
  those 30 % of reforms are the `` austerity neo-liberal '' section which has been proven to be a failure for 5 years already . 
  that is to privatize potentially extremely profitable greek state assets for `` peanuts '' , to cut pensions which are already at the bottom in europe , cut un-employment benefits which are at the bottom of europe ( only 10 % of greek unemployed have received unemployment benefits ever ) , among many others . 
  the reason why varoufakis might believe this is because they are for doing massive reforms in every section of greek society , even beyond what eu wants , but for some reason the troika is obsessed with greece selling off its state assets and this has caused the current stand-off . 
  it is no coincidence that the eu is demanding greece hand over its energy infrastructure merely months/1 -2 years before greece transforms the economy into a energy export based one and with potential trillions of gas/oil in the aegean/ionian . 
  [ on the positive side , varoufakis made a very positive statement today ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/04/24/yanis-varoufakis-greece-is-now-ready-for-big-compromises/ )  `` we have agreed that we are going to speed up negotiations , that we will take another look at the processes , '' varoufakis reportedly said , suggesting that the technical teams may not need to meet both in brussels and athens . 
  `` you can choose to look at it as a half full or half empty bottle . 
  we choose the optimistic way ... the two sides have come much closer on issues like privatizations ... the government has proposed to set up an independent tax commission ... we have had very good discussions on the need to reform the judiciary , '' the greek finance minister explained , as cited by reuters . 
  moreover , varoufakis suggested that the negotiation process would be sped up if creditors could agree to a `` partial disbursement '' in return for a `` narrower list of reforms . '', 
  i am talking about the expulsions , which mainly occurred after the greek genocide . 
   where we suffered faar and faaar more than armenians bullshit , the greeks did not massacre the turks in mainland/islands , they transfered them over peacefully after the greek genocide . 
  i understand that expulsions are not right , but after 1 million greeks were butchered by turks , the greeks still refused to kill the turks they had and simply transfered them over . 
  globalfirepower is a joke ranking system estonia is ranked above greece in this `` rank '' but when you compare the numbers estonia vs greece is 30 soviet tanks vs 2,000 leopard 2 a4/a6/hel 's 11 soviet fighter jets vs 300 modern ones 0 ships vs 3rd best navy in europe etc that ranking system is probably some guy who made that in an afternoon while drunk and now it is the `` official '' ranking of world militaries .

  from 2005 interview with aq leadership http://www.spiegel.de/international/the-future-of-terrorism-what-al-qaida-really-wants-a-369448.html  the third phase this is described as `` arising and standing up '' and should last from 2007 to 2010 . 
  ** `` there will be a focus on syria , '' ** prophesies hussein , based on what his sources told him . 
  the fighting cadres are supposedly already prepared and some are in iraq . 
    the fourth phase between 2010 and 2013 , hussein writes that al-qaida will aim to bring about the collapse of the hated arabic governments . 
  the estimate is that `` the creeping loss of the regimes ' power will lead to a steady growth in strength within al-qaida . '', 
     the fifth phase this will be the point at which an ** islamic state ** , or caliphate , can be declared . 
  the plan is that by this time , between 2013 and 2016 , western influence in the islamic world will be so reduced and israel weakened so much , that resistance will not be feared . 
  al-qaida hopes that by then the islamic state will be able to bring about a new world order . 
    the sixth phase hussein believes that ** from 2016 onwards there will a period of `` total confrontation . 
  '' ** as soon as the caliphate has been declared the `` islamic army '' it will ** instigate the `` fight between the believers and the non-believers '' ** which has so often been predicted by osama bin laden .
