  it is pretty obvious that poland is being groomed by washington to be the co-leader of central europe with germany . 
  you do n't `` ask '' for that money , from what i have read they are preparing for a trial as the committee in charge of this just received 10,000 + pages of material from uk/usa about the occupation . 
   it 's all germany 's fault nobody in syriza has said that , most in syriza like varoufakis openly say that germany has done its best to help greece . 
   pay us reparations now there is a section of syriza that want to investigate this case , mainly backed by a ww2 veteran . 
  nobody is saying `` pay now '' , more like `` investigate now '' . 
  source : `` people briefed on how syriza thinks '' how the fuck can they release an article with a source like that ? 
  you would think they would be more responsible . 
  articles and statements like these cause direct consequences on the greek economy . 
  good guy dutch, 
  no lol , that was my attempt at a simple explanation of unsustainable expansions . 
  i built a strategy around a few indicators that i use . 
  i am doing binary trading right now , working on it for 8 months and getting a 5 wins to 1 loss win ratio , soon entering traditional forex trading . 
  i actually recently started to get into it  hopefully soon, 
  why are they a terror state ? 
  well , nobody can predict the future but 70/1 was a massive unprecedented dip . 
  if i had 1 million $ to play with i would have stacked trades so 250k on 70/1 , then another 250k if it went lower to 75/1 , 80/1 , 85/1 . 
  i will check out the book, 
  grikkland as scandi 's called it was basically their `` 2nd home '' [ immigrants from sweden , denmark , norway and iceland kept a predominantly norse cast to the organization until the late 11th century ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/varangian_guard ) . 
  in these years , scandinavian men left to enlist in the byzantine varangian guard in such numbers that a medieval swedish law from v\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland declared no one could inherit while staying in greece -- the then scandinavian term for the byzantine empire -- to stymie the emigration, 
  most big time traders got ultra-wealthy with that attitude also , a lot of the best traders on earth only do a handful of trades per year but they wait for perfect opportunities like when ruble was 70/1 . 
  i personally did not trade it because i did not have a forex account at the time nor millions to make a hugely profitable trade . 
  hopefully in a few years i am in a position to do so and get in a trade with a similar scenario . 
  the only traders who go broke are the ones who trade like it is a casino which is most people . 
  i would of loved to place some big money when ruble was 70/1 $ . 
  any idiot trader knows that moves like that are not sustainable . 
  what goes down must come up and what goes up must come down , it is the nature of trading , a self balancing act . 
  3rd bailout is not necessary if greece can survive until mid-august without it . 
  greece has already survived since august 2014 without any aid/loans/etc from eu . 
  the next 3 months are the `` peak of the mountain '' of debt , the largest debt payments will need to be made . 
  if greece can get the final 8 billion from 2nd bailout with eu approving varoufakis reform package , then greece will most likely manage to survive . 
  [ `` from mid-august greece factually has no commitments for interest payments ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_11/03/2015_548101 ) ... for the rest of the decade and so one just has to get past the months of april , may , june , august and then the situation should be stabilized sustainably , '' - president of euro working group [ full 26 page varoufakis reform package ] ( http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/55b27a7e-d87c-11e4-ba53-00144feab7de.pdf ) ( note there are already rumors that there have already been substantial additions to this package including tax/vat reforms ), 
  ofcourse , i personally have said many times that military spending is the # 1 reason greece is in this current situation . 
  estimates of as much as 600 billion were spent on military in the last 30 years . 
  in the 1980 's military spending was as much as 8-10 % of gdp and 90 's around 5-6 % which is almost 4x the average european country . 
  syriza this year brought it to below 2 % for the first time since greece joined nato . 
  i just do n't think cherry-picking this specific deal made much sense . 
  [ the defense minister has pledged to review every military deal made in the past 3 decades and look for corruption ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/02/02/greek-defense-minister-armament-procurement-files-will-be-reopened/ ) [ 32 people were also arrested 2 weeks ago for military deals corruption ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_26/03/2015_548563 ), 
  greece has a military budget of 3 billion this year , which is much lower than its ever been and for the first time below 2 % of gdp . 
  this military deal for the planes was a requirement if greece was going to join the nato patrols on sea routes , which is why this deal was made . 
  it is pretty odd why you find this as evidence of anything . 
   the young man took the microphone and said that he is the first student from kyrgyzstan who is studying the greek language to the audience 's applause . 
  the student said that he wants to become a diplomat and work in greece and asked the greek prime minister if the two countries will establish diplomatic relations . 
  greece and bulgaria are working on building pipeline infrastructure together so that is not the case . 
  bulgaria has already purchased 1 billion cubic meters of caspian sea gas that will run through greece into the soon to be built greek-bulgarian pipeline . 
  [ the area this took place in , kipoi , is where the proposed russian pipeline through turkey will reach to on the land border . 
  ] ( http://www.naturalgaseurope.com/budapest-meeting-supports-turkish-stream ) and also the [ tap pipeline ( azerbaijan ) ] ( http://www.offshoreenergytoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/trans-adriatic-pipeline-selected-for-shah-deniz-gas-transport.jpg ), 
  [ lagarde : ` greece repaid the amount owed to imf for april ' ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/04/09/lagarde-greece-repaid-the-amount-owed-to-imf-for-april/ ) april 9 , 2015 [ greece paid 448 mln euro tranche to the imf ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/04/09/greece-paid-448-mln-euro-tranche-to-the-imf/ ), 
   the institutions in europe currently have lent greece 257bn and you still have the guts to ask for more what are you referring too ? 
  syriza is not asking for anything new , i am not sure if you know the details of the current situation . 
  syriza is trying to get the final 8 billion euros released from the 2nd bailout signed in 2011 . 
  to get this final tranche of 8 billion , syriza must create a massive reform package [ here is the complete 26 page reform package ] ( http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/55b27a7e-d87c-11e4-ba53-00144feab7de.pdf ) ( new report today saying additional tax/vat policies were added on top of that )  you have ousted you former goverment for the wrong reasons . 
  you did n't kick them because some of them were criminals and fraudsters what !?? 
  the previous government leader literally comes from an oligarch dynasty , pasok/nd are two sides of the same oligarch coin , both are deeply controlled by greek shipping/media/development oligarchs . 
  samaras is the definition of corrupt to the bone with the rest of nd and pasok . 
  do you even know what samaras would have done if he stayed in power ? 
  they would have stayed quite , samaras would play the `` good student '' to merkel like he always has and then sign a 3rd bailout package this summer for 100-150 billion euros !!, 
  that means the government you wanted to win not only would have done no reform package like syriza , but they would have gotten the final 8 billion from 2nd bailout ( no questions asked ) and on top of that gotten a 100-150 billion euro 3rd bailout !, 
  syriza right now is fighting to the death to not take a 3rd bailout because that would destroy them . 
  how fucked up is your media where you think the previous government was the `` good guys '' and syriza is the `` bad guys '' when syriza are the ones who do n't want a 3rd bailout and are doing massive reforms to get a final 8 billion loan ( which was signed in 2011 ), 
  [ here is the full 26 page reform package submitted by varoufakis ] ( http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/55b27a7e-d87c-11e4-ba53-00144feab7de.pdf ), 
  3-5 % , could be worse i suppose but the point is that 2-3 billion a month is extremely difficult . 
  the current crisis is because the next 4 months will be the `` peak '' of debt where greece will have to pay up to 5-8 billion euros in june-july each month . 
  the previous government wanted to stay quite and then accept a 3rd bailout package this summer for 100 billion euros . 
  syriza is doing everything in their power to not take a 3rd bailout and yet they are the `` bad guys '' to people like you . 
  i am not even sure if most people understand that the current dilema is that syriza is trying to get the remaining 8 billion in funds from the 2nd bailout signed in 2011 . 
  they are not asking for `` free stuff '' , but the final tranche of loans from the previous agreement and they have not received nay assistance since august 2014 . 
  also what `` free stuff '' are you talking about ? 
  do you consider loans with interest `` free '' ? 
  you realize that greece is paying back all loans for last 8 months without any outside help , correct ? 
  greece has not received any aid from eu since august 2014 and is averaging 2-3 billion in loan payments a month . 
  they hold 2-3 major nato bases , a major uk base , french base , american bases . 
  i think there are around 10 western major military bases total on the greek side . 
  ofcourse , the tanap ( red ) section of the pipeline had its construction ground-breaking ceremony 2 weeks ago . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  you sound like you are 14 years old also is n't losing every war you 've been in for like two centuries enough for you ? 
  calm down with the war rhetoric you dork . 
  well usa is not acting like it , usa-russian trading has increased by 7 % . 
  is this just a eu-russia cold war ? 
  [ russian president vladimir putin has said that trade between russia and the united states has increased by 7 percent , while trade with germany has been `` degrading . 
  '' ] ( http://rbth.com/news/2014/12/22/russias_trade_with_us_grows_with_eu_falls_-_putin_42460.html ), 
  did you read the article or listen to the meeting ? 
  tsipras disagrees with sanctions because he believes it could lead to a cold war . 
  he then said that he will not go against eu and putin also confirmed that they will not be lifting sanctions on greece . 
  the deal is to set up joint russian and greek partnership to export agriculture products to russia . 
  so the sanctions will still stay for greek companies , but those companies can partner witha russian company to export . 
  also tsipras walked away with a 40 + billion $ pipeline deal . 
  syriza is actually very pro-usa and has setup a comitee to organize greek-american partnership . 
  [ syriza thinks usa should be the middle man between a greece and eu deal .

  [ press conference in a nutshell ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzpndhtdl9a ), 
  they are already in eu though, 
  greece/cyprus is one of the biggest contributors to nato and holds the two most important eu nato logistical operations centers of nato which are in crete and cyprus . 
  the igi ( greece  italy ) pipeline is pretty far in development , construction on it should begin around 2016-2017 . 
  also albania is building a pipeline from albania  italy . 
  i believe the albanian pipeline will be used to feed italy with caspian sea gas and the igi pipeline will be used to feed italy with russian and eventually greek , cypriot , israeli gas . 
  [ greece , fyrom , serbian and hungarian ministers met yesterday ] ( http://www.naturalgaseurope.com/budapest-meeting-supports-turkish-stream ) and agreed to build pipeline infrastructure . 
  greece  fyrom pipeline and from there it will go up to serbia and then hungary . 
  russian gas will be feeding this network mainly . 
  you serioulsy think greek government policy was to threaten to send illegal refugees as a weapon ? 
  not only was the statement not from syriza , but it had nothing to do with `` weaponizing refugees '' , it was more of a `` we have no more funds to control borders '' statement .
