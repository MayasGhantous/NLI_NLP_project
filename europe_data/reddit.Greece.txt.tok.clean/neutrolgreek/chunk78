  i think the most surprising thing from this crisis is finding out how propagandaized northern european media is , it is basically on the same level as russian state media where people like you just swallow up anything you hear and go with the most insane theories . 
  i used to think northern european media was `` balanced '' or at least had some reasonable debates but the amount of bullshit really is close to russian state media levels . 
  central/east europe will be fine , they not only have the nord stream pipeline which is a direct russia  germany pipeline ( germany wants to be a hub too ) , but also norway is increasing exports . 
  and now they have the tap ( azerbaijan/caspian sea ) gas as a nice bonus . 
  the tap pipeline ( azerbaijan/iran/iraq / turkmen/etc ) gas will feed the igb ( greece  bulgaria ) pipeline and from there it will go up to romania who will act as a hub for baltics and poland . 
  tap will also feed albania and from there itwill go to italy and then west euro markets . 
  the russian pipeline will go to kipoi , greece ( across greek-turkish land border ) and from there it will follow the same path as tap pipeline across greece . 
  [ the russian pipeline will connect to fyrom , and from there it will go to serbia and then possibly some more north ] ( http://www.naturalgaseurope.com/budapest-meeting-supports-turkish-stream ) . 
  also connection to igi ( greece  italy ) pipeline . 
  that is everything that is confirmed so far , whinging wo n't change anything, 
  i used to believe this theory also when younger but after reading some things i do n't think it is true . 
  in ancient greek times , `` brotherly '' ( non-gay ) friendship between two males was one of the best/most cherished things in ancient life . 
  diogenis the philosopher is known to have said that the only friendships that matter are those which are extremely close bonds and all other friendships are basically worthless . 
  alexander had a best friend since he was a toddler , who he grew up with . 
  they became brothers in friendship and worked together in battle and alexander 's 10 year march through the east . 
  from what i have read the theory that alexander was gay became popular in 17/18th century english circles because during that time in england , there was an extreme stigma against male + male friendship ( non-gay ) . 
  it was seen as `` gay '' to have a very close male friend because in that time they thought that any male + male friendship would always lead to homosexuality . 
  thus it was seen that alexander and his best friend were gay . 
  now i am not saying alexander was not gay for sure . 
  . but it is very much debateable . 
  i hoenstly do n't know , but i thought id share my take on it . 
  the igb ( greece  bulgaria ) pipeline is a `` eu common project '' and will receive funding to be built in 2016 . 
  the azerbaijani/irani/iraqi / turkemenistani/etc gas will be going through the [ tap/tanap ] ( http://i.imgur.com/e9qhzde.jpg ) system which started construction last month . 
  this russian pipeline is a different matter but with the tap/tanap/igb in place soon , there will already be decent infrastructure soon there .

  the most important is a united coast guard and united immigrant center in neutral territory that no country is 100 % responsible for . 
  greece with a bit of help can handle patrolling the sea , the largest problem though is putting them somewhere , eu desperately needs a united stance on this issue . 
  [ isis plans to use immigrant boats from libya to cause terror in europe and close shipping routes ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/isis-plans-to-use-immigrant-boats-from-libya-to-cause-terror-in-europe-and-close-shipping-routes-10053148.html ) it is a very real threat , many experts think that isis are building up their numbers in europe to prepare for attacks in the coming decade . 
  what are the reforms ? 
  possibly , but there are a lot of isis members entering europe through boats in greece and italy . 
  greece is averaging around 100 boat people a day and italy up to 1,500 a day . 
  this is causing a massive strain on greek border and coast guard , which is what i assume this article is about . 
  i do n't see why there is not an eu initiative to assist greece/italy with these boat people , almost none of them stay and just move up north , there should be a united eu coast guard , imo . 
  greece lost 10 % of its population from ww2 , russia lost 10 % also greece then lost another 10 % of its population in teh civil war in the post-ww2 chaos . 
  the greek resistance lasted 330 days during ww2 , almost 6x longer then the 2nd longest resistance .

  tsipras official policy on sanctions is that he does not believe sanctions will produce any positive results , but at the same time he will not go against eu and veto them . 
  why do you think greece is black-mailing eastern europe ? 
  black-mailing implies that greece would be asking something in eastern european nations in return which it is not . 
  as far as i know greece wants to build economic ties with russia , specifically a pipeline form russia to greece , the same way germany benefits from having the nord stream pipeline from russia to germany . 
  i have explained it before , but i will make it shorter this time basically this has nothing to do with money , i am almost positive that nobody in syriza expects to actually get 287.7 billion euros , or even a fraction of that 5-10 billion euros . 
  what syriza is doing with this is turning the tables around on the creditor/borrower relationship between germany and greece . 
  basically tsipras/syriza feel that greece was treated as being on the losing side of a major war when it accepted the bailout terms . 
  this is often brought up by tsipras in how the troika entered greece as a `` ruler entering its colony '' and that they feel that greece has lost its sovereignty by being a `` debt colony '' . 
  this has a lot if not everything to do with the fact that after ww2 and the resulting civil war due to the occupation after-effects , which caused the loss of 20 % of total greek citizens lives and incalculable damage , greece completely forgave germany and decided that germany deserved to be given a stimulus package and forgave all germany 's debts to greece from the war . 
  syriza feels that this should have played a role in loosening the demands of greece and assisting it with less austerity which it never received . 
  before you downvote me , i am just trying to explain the logic of syriza from what i understand they have said on this matter . 
  `` paying/collect taxes for once '', 
  had to add that .7 to make it seem correct, 
  its not, 
  ok fair enougn , but as far as turkey not being a threat , nothing could be further from the truth . 
  [ your defense minister just claimed this week that 16 greek islands belong to turkey ] ( http://www.todayszaman.com/diplomacy_turkish-defense-minister-rejects-greek-territorial-claims-on-aegean-islands_376391.html ), 
  you realize that the current dillema in greece is because syriza has to siphon almost all surplus money to pay for imf/eu loans right ? 
  greece will average around 500 million - 1 billion of payments per week for the next 4 months and then around mid-august everything becomes much more sustainable . 
  syriza is currently in negotiations to create a reform package to release the last 8 billion euros of loans from 2nd bailout package which was signed around 4 years ago . 
  after that there is no more bailouts if it goes well and syriza pulls it off . 
  you have no idea what you are talking about . 
  `` paying bills '' implies charity or donation , the reailty is anything but . 
  syriza could have taken the easy road and accepted a 3rd bailout which is what creditor nations desire but everything they are doing is to prevent that . 
  it is not about `` beating '' anyone , military , at least in greece 's case is to prevent any war as it being to costly to the enemy and impossible to hold greek territory . 
  low possibility does not mean impossibility and nobody knows what the future holds , although the chances of an actual war are close to 0 % . 
  or because they are american made planes and only usa can legally/technically upgrade them ? 
  just a thought . 
  [ syriza already confirmed the creation of a comittee to investigate every military deal for the last 3 decades ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/02/02/greek-defense-minister-armament-procurement-files-will-be-reopened/ ) , do you really think they would start by taking bribes which will be investigated ? 
  when most deals like this happen it usually comes with tons of freebies , so 500 million on upgrading these planes at full cost and as a bonus usa will give a few tons of artillery or some humvee 's / tanks as extra . 
   it was pretty clear that the 500 million figure is the total value of the deal , which i believe is to be paid in the next 7 years through a series of installments yes , but not 500 million due immediately . 
  50 million a year for 10 years from procurement fund ( 700 million ) which is around 30 % of total military budget . 
   it also has pressing needs for cash to cover expenses that syriza 's government describes as a humanitarian crisis , and it 's currently negotiating with creditors to borrow even more money to cover those expenses . . 
  agreed , but military spending is reduced to help with funding this year already , i do n't think it is legally/technically possible to stop all military spending for a year . 
  do you expect greece to stop spending any money on military ? 
  it has already been drastically reduced which is a good thing . 
  yeh , not 500 million like the title would make it seem . 
  it will be paid off over 10 years . 
  greece has a budget of 2.5-3 billion a year on military , 700 million of that is used to get new equipment or upgrade already existing ones . 
  50 million a year of that 700 million for 10 years will be used for this upgrade . 
  [ to be fair , military spending has gone down to match what most european countries spend as % of gdp ] ( http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/policy-budget/2015/01/31/greece-election-defense-cuts/22484505/ )  in the 1980s , spending averaged 6.2 percent of gross domestic product , against a european average of 2.9 percent , while from 2000 to 2010 it was 3 percent against an eu average of 1.6 percent . 
  that was followed by a drop of around 29 percent in spending between 2009 and 2011 . 
    this year , greece plans to spend $ 3.25 billion on defense , down 46 percent from the 2010 figure . 
  procurement spending in 2015 will amount to $ 700 million , down 65 percent from 2010, 
  the 500 million will not be paid any time soon before anybody reacts to this , this will be a multi-year plan . 
  considering greece has a set budget on military spending this will likely take a percentage of that spending for next few years .

  almost all radicalizing is done online , there are countless extremist forums and hubs .

  [ `` from mid-august greece factually has no commitments for interest payments ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_11/03/2015_548101 ) ... for the rest of the decade and so one just has to get past the months of april , may , june , august and then the situation should be stabilized sustainably , '' - president of euro working group basically the next 4 months will be the deciding factor if greece stays in or out of the euro . 
  if syriza can manage to survive until mid-august then everything will get exponentially easier as monthly payments will be cut in half if not more from then on . 
  fine , then you can shut it down and dismantle it , since it is so evil, 
  how does usa deal with the fact that saudi arabia runs on american money and support which they use to support jihadist and terror attacks on americans ? 
  how does germany get away with building a pipeline to russia which sole purpose was to bypass ukraine and yet greece is supposed to cancel all economic deals with russia ? 
  unless russia decideds to declare war on the eu , then economic deals are just that , they do not signify any political shifts . 
  if greece decided to burn all its bridges to russia then it would be the final nail in the coffin of the greek economy . 
  if greece was an economic super-power then ofcourse things would be different , but it is n't . 
  no , making some major economic deals with russia such as a 50 billion $ pipeline and increase in exports to russia does not mean a geo-political shift . 
  surprisingly a country in a great depression looks for economic deals , shocking is n't it ?
