  ofcourse not , because they are black . 
  am i a nazi because i do not want foreigners to outnumber native europeans ? 
  according to you i am literally hitler . 
  how would you feel if 500 million europeans moved into india and decided to set up their own rules ? 
  `` no borders , no nations '' is your motto . 
  except if it applies to non-europeans . 
  then there must be borders and nations !, 
  to protect diversity !, 
  now i want to go to slovakia, 
  whatever works, 
  not really , could just do an interstellar and just store `` human seeds '' in a frozen vault alongside the plant seeds . 
  do you want to debate or just call everyone a nazi ? 
  if mods have a problem with my post i will edit it , but i do n't think i put anything offensive . 
  i posted links in a seprate post, 
  spectator uk [ the result is an exodus of biblical proportions out of africa into italy ] ( http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/9303722/italys-decriminalising-of-illegal-immigration-has-acted-as-a-green-light-to-boat-people/ ) . 
  so far this year , more than 100,000 boat people have arrived in italy -- two thirds of them brought ashore by the italian navy . 
  that is more than double the number who arrived in 2011 , the previous record year . 
  it is estimated that the total by the end of 2014 will surpass 200,000 . 
  so far this year italy has deported only 10,000 . 
  this is ** just ** from italy and ** just ** from boats , keep that in mind isis has taken control of libyan ports over the last few months and they are growing in power . 
  [ isis threatens to send 500,000 migrants to europe as a ` psychological weapon ' ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2958517/the-mediterranean-sea-chaos-gaddafi-s-chilling-prophecy-interview-isis-threatens-send-500-000-migrants-europe-psychological-weapon-bombed.html ), 
  that is being extremely conservative though and does not take the almost yearly exponential growth of illegal islamic migrants coming into the eu . 
  just before the `` arab spring '' ( winter ) illegal migrants of muslim origin were around 30-50 ,000 in total for the year . 
  last year as syria became hell , the total migration was around 250-350 ,000 ( dont forget sweden offers full citizenship to all syrians who arrive there ) this year as syria , yemen , iraq , nigeria , kenya , etc are heating up the expected migration for 2015 is 500,000-750 ,000 2016 it is expected 1,000,000 will enter and this will grow every single year . 
  the islamic world is heading into a potential 100 years sunni vs shia war for existance . 
  yemen is on fire and the saudis have created a sunni unified military , isis is spreading like cancer along with nusra and aq . 
  shit is only just beginning to get really bad . 
  by 2020 , it is not out of the question for eu to be takign in over 2-3 million refugees per year . 
  this article is already outdated . 
  i am not suggesting it , others are . 
  [ full reform package ] ( http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/55b27a7e-d87c-11e4-ba53-00144feab7de.pdf ) uploaded online i am still going through it , but it looks very extensive . 
  [ eu confirmed progress has been made in today 's teleconference . 
  ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_01/04/2015_548738 ), 
  russia is not an enemy state , maybe to you it is . 
  as far as `` integrity '' , over 20-30 % of greek population lost their lives for europe in ww2 and civil war to stay with europe ( while your people surrendered after 24 hours ) , i doubt that will change because of a few economic deals in the energy sector . 
  greece will use its position as a central hub in a positive way , it would be suicidal to risk it like you imagine will happen . 
  `` last country in the world '' . 
  your idiocy knows no bounds the imports will be diverse , russian , azerbaijani , turkmeniestani , irani , iraqi , israeli , cypriot , egyptian and more countries plan to use greece as their entry point in the eu . 
  greece is the single country you would want to manage all these sources . 
  brussels has plans to build a gas stock market in athens to manage all of it so its not like greece will have total control either way . 
  it has nothing to do with revenge , [ this pipeline was supposed to be built to greece in 2007-2008 ] ( http://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2012/03/15/russian-spies-revealed-assassination-plot-against-former-pm-karamanlis/ ) when karamanlis greek government suggested it . 
  a year later he was out of office and had death threats against him . 
  yeh , alexey miller ( gazprom ceo ) is quoted as saying that this pipeline will be the main source of russian gas into the eu . 
  most likely the the initial 10 bcm of gas of russian gas into greece will piggy-back off the tap pipeline which enters cosntruction in 2016 and built to transport azerbaijani gas into eu . 
  from there it will be a slow build up of infrastructure until they achieve 50-60 + bcm by 2030 . 
  neuron is a 100 % air-combat drone , there are already tons of surveillance drones that serve their purpose well, 
  it is called the neuron drone and has been in development for a while . 
  [ france , italy , greece , sweden , spain , switzerland ] ( http://www.humanoides.fr/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/blog_humanoides_fr_drone_neuron_vol_istres_europe.jpg ) are currently doing flight tests on the neuron drone . 
  live-fire tests begin in 2016 and then the final drone will be created around 2020 , which is what this article is about . 
  [ video of drone ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wardlutzlsy ), 
  does germany `` collude '' with authoritarian states for the nord stream pipeline they built to bypass ukraine ? 
  well the natural gas engines are a electric/nat gas hybrid engine , at least for the busses i saw available . 
  gas truly is the future of green energy , i am not just making it up to piss you off . 
  solar/wind will be able to power homes but gas will be able to provide a green energy engine to replace the old large vehicle/ship transport engines . 
  solar/wind/natural gas is the future of green energy . 
  did i offend you or something ? 
  i thought that was a german regional flag . 
  gas is not evil , it is the future of green energy . 
  greece and germany are both pushing for a major shift to equip public transport like busses and even large transport like shipping vessels to a natural gas green energy engine , which emits barely 5 % of chemicals traditional engines put out there . 
  you twisted my words even more . 
  greece will never be perfect but it can do better , i feel these energy deals with russia will bring it to a better position , not make it `` perfect '', 
  the only way to legally leave the eu is by its own will ( like uk might do ) or by a unanimous vote to `` suspend membership '' . 
  this means that even if you get the cyprus vote ( which you wont ) , it would only be for a suspension . 
  those are the actual laws in place . 
  and to change a law requires a unanimous vote ( which you wont get ) . 
  it is not happening , one way or the other . 
  how does greece destroy itself and give a slap to ukraine ? 
  i assume you are german right ? 
  if russian gas was such an `` evil '' thing , then how about you close down the nord stream pipeline which was built solely to bypass ukraine . 
  i follow http://www.naturalgaseurope.com/ and read almost every article they post . 
  i may sound like a broken record but please do n't twist my words `` glorious pipeline etc '' . 
  greek energy minister just completed his 2 day visit to meet alexey miller , gazprom ceo and one of the most powerful men on earth . 
  tsipras visits putin next week and again in 30 days . 
  everything they talk about has to do with this pipeline project , it is just the reality of the situation . 
  it would hinder greece if it was the only gas pipeline project in the works and russia had control of all greek gas imports . 
  greece is aiming to be the hub of russian gas which i already stated , but also the hub of azerbaijani , turkmenistan gas with the tap/tanap pipeline which started construction last week . 
  there is also the israel/cyprus  greece pipeline which aims to bring 20 billion cubic meters . 
  when i say greece wants to be an energy hub i do n't mean of just russian gas . 
  greece is trying to position itself to be the hub of all these countries and if it pulls it off it will completely transform greece . 
  no , as in re-build the economy and stop taking loans . 
  greece has an opportunity to take in 50 + billion cubic meters of russian gas to distribute through the eu and even africa/south america with lng , to work with russian experts to exploit aegean/ionian sea gas and to start shipping fruits/veggies to russia . 
  greece is not asking for a `` bailout '' by russia , there are some major projects in the works which could completely shift greece into an energy hub . 
  if that bothers you than that is your problem . 
  i am not pro-putin , do n't make assumptions . 
  russia is not putin and putin is not russia . 
  the road to a better future between eu and russia will start with a kickstart in economic co-operation . 
  syriza is quoted as wanting to be the `` bridge of peace '' between both sides . 
  eternal conflict between eu and russia wo n't solve anything outside of a few foreign interests that are not in the eu . 
  there is a difference between cooperating among equals and being treated like a colony who must do what it is told . 
  syriza is co-operating with eu on every level , working with russia is not some `` betrayal '' . 
  eternal conflict is not what is best for eu 's future . 
   ca n't we do something so that for every cent they get from russia , they get one cent less from us ? 
  that is the entire point and one of the core strategies of syriza . 
  it very much does . 
  . the moment greece theoretically would be kicked out the eu ( which is impossible due to cyprus veto ) , greece would make a complete turn to russia . 
  russia is greece 's main importer of greek agriculture products . 
  you want greece in the middle of a great depression to stop all trade with their biggest trade partner ? 
  russia is offering a 50 billion $ pipeline to be built to greece . 
  to assist greece in dozens of gas/oil exploration projects in the aegean and ionian sea and to start importing greek products again . 
  greece and russia are only beginning a massive campaign to build stronger ties , especially in energy and tourism sector , there is no longer some pathetic puppets in government to bow their heads to eu demands , that time is long ** long ** gone .
