  i only take offense at the `` everyone '' must help part . 
  if sweden wants to take a billion refugees per month , they are welcome to do so . 
  that is a shitty way to begin a debate jews are compatible with western culture middle east christians who are being murdered and tortured every day for being peaceful christians are 100 % compatible with european society . 
  i would not mind syrian christians or egyptian christians in greece, 
  first greece is in the eu second there is no such thing as `` welfare '' these so called `` bailouts '' are high interest loans which germany/france/etc has already [ profited billions off of ] ( http://www.dw.de/german-bank-bailout-fund-posts-first-ever-full-year-profit/a-16809503 ) and will for the next century or more third , i do not give a shit if sweden imports a billion `` refugees '' , that is your problem alone and there will be no `` sharing '' of this burden . 
  that is not a reason for us to do anything . 
  the middle east chaos is not our problem and there is absolutely no reason to take in 1 refugee let alone millions . 
  you swedes are going to have to find out the hard way what islam brings in the long run , you will make a good example at least to the rest of europe . 
  i would have no issues with saving the middle east/indian/pakistani christians who are being brutally murdered and tortured every day for being christian though , is n't that funny ? 
  we import the most intolerant people on earth because of `` muh guilt '' but they will kill any christian who does not bend the knee to islam, 
   everyone must help why ? 
  [ after christmas , it will be possible for prosecutors to take criminal action against swedes who criticize immigrants or people in authority online after a constitutional committee 's report on the matter has been voted in parliament , seen in a letter from the parliamentary offices .

  parts of london look like pakistan islamic state kingdom i do agree with you though that at the very least there is a very open debate about immigration in uk and the harmful effects about it . 
  in sweden , to just mention the fact that immigration might be a bit to extreme will get you hunted down by the media and politicians . 
  there is a form of leftist fascism that arose in sweden that prevents any discussion because it might hurt someones feelings . 
  i also love how sweden gets voted # 1 every year in `` press freedom '' !, 
  always makes me chuckle a bit, 
  do you think spanish government 's recent purchase of 1 billion $ of riot gear is in preparation for the upcoming street riots in catalan ? 
  what do you think is the worst case scenario ? 
  catalan 's have their own language and culture, 
  and england, 
  leftists will refuse to understand this , they will ignore it and continue shouting raysis at the top of their lungs, 
  well the greek people have the lowest house-hold debt in the western world , so there is no debt to pay for us . 
  the government on the other hand has tons of ( public ) debt , 300 billion , which will likely be paid off with the gas/oil wealth 2020 + . 
  also political system is infinitely better than pre-2008 so not sure where that came from .

  that number is inflated since many people work small `` odd-jobs '' that change weekly/daily , but it is still an extremely high number so i understand . 
  i do n't think that should be used as key factor to define an economy/country though . 
  i can use this [ suicide list ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_suicide_rate ) to show how greece has lowest suicide rate in the western world while many wealthy northern countries have the highest to `` prove '' how great greece is , but there are many factors and `` lists '' to put something into perspective . 
  i got the number here - https://www.google.com/search?q=scotland+gdp+per+capita&amp;oq=scotland+gdp+per+capita&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.2457j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=utf-8 it is outdated so i admit i was wrong !, 
  still though , can you stop using greece as an example of `` doom '' when it is even today one of the wealthiest countries in europe , after a great depression not seen since the 1920 's !, 
  depressing weather + no sun can make people really angry/on edge , especially fucking snow . 
  in greece the strong sun and calm sea has a healing effect on soul and body which is why i think so many people return every year, 
  eh , scotland gdp per capita 16,000 $ greek gdp per capita 22,000 $ how pathetic do you have to be to think becoming greece is a bad thing when you still are not even close to there ? 
  your country has been held up by the uk and is the only reason you are not the moldova of the north . 
  polish people have a steel outer shell with a soft soul from my experience . 
  lots of greeks are like that also, 
  spend one day in nyc and oslo will look like a different planet, 
  awesome , did you learn greek while there ? 
  if so , how difficult was it for you ? 
  the minds of pro-russians is the only thing that matters to the russian propaganda machine , they do not care what any outsider thinks . 
  the build up to east ukraine `` rebellion '' was a masterful and extremely well produced propaganda campaign aimed at convincing russians it was the right thing to do, 
  which is why i hope socialists never ever gain power again in greece , they had control from 80 's -2008 and created the mess and the socialist pasok party basically disintegrated . 
  now syriza socialists scum will come and do the same thing if they win next election , while current center-right party has been rebuilding . 
  that was a really huge mistake . 
  nokia should have been what galaxy is for android, 
  when mccain and victoria nuland appeared at maidan , that was a huge anti-west propaganda source to feed ethnic russians in east ukraine . 
  they used that and especially those pictures and videos to create a massive anti-maidan propaganda campaign in eastern ukraine . 
  when maidan won , everyone in east saw it as an american operation due to this and that 's when anti-maidan protests began,

  that is the most hipster thing i 've read all year, 
  if you are going to be a separatist you need a very powerful flag with symbols of war/conquering etc , look at the donetsk/lugansk flags full of empire symbols and phrases or the confederate inspired novorossiya flag . 
  you cant just repaint the current flag of a country and expect to be taken seriously, 
  [ no , very serious !, 
  i find it is mostly older brits/scots who seek out uk pubs and other british oriented places in greece , which is understandable since older people are more content to just want to relax than explore . 
  youth really do like exploring and seeking adventure though or just going crazy in nightclubs which is normal, 
  in greece , any street with lots of `` uk pubs '' and things like that , i never understood why anyone would come to greece just to go to a traditional style uk pub , but many do that . 
  besides that , greece is an open place to explore , tons of hidden gems, 
  last time this happened was in anticipation of a leak of the foreign minister ( now president ) davotuglu organizing a false flag attack on syria to initiate a turkish/syrian war . 
  wonder what it will be this time, 
  * rubs hands together violently *, 
  poland received 300 billion $ from eu of actual charity money , no `` bailout '' loan bullshit . 
  that is larger than the `` bailouts '' of greece , spain , portugal and ireland combined and they must pay every dime back with usury levels of interest which poland does not . 
  france-iberian union possible with common currency german controlled eu for most other parts of europe possible nordic union uk-australia-new zealand-south africa union is also possible, 
  [ if trends continue , the number of non-believers is set to overtake the number of christians by 2030 . 
  in the last six years , the number of muslims has surged by 37 per cent to 2.6 million ; hindus by 43 per cent and buddhists by 74 per cent . 
  but the number of sikhs and jewish believers fell slightly . 
  ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2109488/2030-the-year-britain-cease-chrsitian-nation-march-secularism.html ) you will obviously not accept this source/claim , but just do n't act surprised when it actually does happen, 
  germany is pure at heart and can never do wrong , i do not like your insinuations of my beloved german people . 
  islam will also be the largest religion in uk in 20 years . 
  maybe scotland wants to avoid that mess ? 
  wars are never fought for irrelevant reasons , except for murica, 
  its an amazing deal , especially when you consider greece already has the best tank force in europe with hundreds of leo 2 a6/leo 2 hel ( modified built in greece leo 2 a6 ) [ leo 2 hel ] ( http://youtu.be/vmtwps9ah-u?t=24s ) 1,000 + modern tanks is ridiculous for a country the size of greece but i am not complaining especially with the 400 free m1a1, 
  you are acting like `` bailout '' is some kind of charity you dunce . 
  they are loans , extremely profitable usury level loans from germany which has already profited billions off them . 
  you are acting like a great depression worse than usa one in the 1920 's the last 6 tears was n't `` punishment '' enough chill out mehmet, 
  which tanks was that ? 
  the 400 m1a1 abrams deal was 400 free m1a1 tanks for greece non-lethal supporting role in iraq/afghan wars for allied countries . 
  greece only has to pay 150 million $ to get m1a1 refurbished as brand new which is an amazing deal for 400 tanks like that . 
  greece gdp/capita is still 22,000 $ which is pretty decent compared to the region besides italy which has 26,000 $ gdp/capita to put it into perspective russia gdp/capita is 15,000 and ukraine is 3,000 $ gdp/capita,
