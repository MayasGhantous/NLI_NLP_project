  even if you wanted too , you could n't ( cyprus veto among other things ) besides , greece is crucial to the west 's geo-strategic role in the eastern med . 
  crete and cyprus hold the two main logistical operations headquarters of nato in the region . 
  i could go on but you get the point . 
  that will happen 2020 + most likely . 
  right now syriza is focused on gas pipelines , their stated goal is to be the hub of between 60-120 billion cubic meters of gas flowing through eu by early 2020 's . 
  most of this gas will come from azerbaijan , turkemenistan and russia with a large possibility of greek , cypriot and israeli gas adding to it . 
  only if barcelona changes its name to minas tirith, 
  the only red lines tsipras has set is to not sell energy and water infra-structure specifically . 
  varoufakis was quoted as saying this was a good deal the week after syriza won . 
  i assume the finer details were worked on such as pensions . 
  ivan the not-so-terrible ? 
  russia wants to build a pipeline from russia to kipoi , greece which is the town just beyond the greek-turkish land border . 
  after the cancellation of nabucco and south-stream this is the 3rd attempt to build an alternate pipeline to europe outside of the russia-ukraine pipeline which they want to cease using . 
  greece is asking for some help now and in return greece will give russia its full backing for this pipeline in the eu . 
  [ syriza to go after 80,000 rich tax evaders ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/03/24/greek-govt-to-go-after-80000-rich-tax-evaders/ ) the government has said they hope to complete around 3-5 ,000 cases by the end of the summer, 
  it could be worse though , if we did n't have thessaloniki we would truly be fucked right now, 
  either way , it is for the better it goes to international court . 
  after the decision is made both sides can put it behind them , and this issue has been a major one since the 1990 's . 
  it is also just a start of a number of trials between germany and greece . 
  there is the 1 billion hoscheft ( ? ), 
  tax evasion , the largest ever tax evasion done in greece and the billions siemens stole from greece . 
  and then there is the submarine deal , 32 were arrested in greece yesterday and to begin the overal campaign for this also , meanwhile germany is hiding the prime suspect of this deal in germany and refuses to hand him over . 
  the only way forward is for both sides to `` iron out '' the grudges , otherwise there will never be a forward momentum . 
  also please hold back the `` hand that feeds you '' bullshit . 
  do you seriously think greece is supposed to be thankful for taking on 300 billion $ of banking debt and a 30 % reduction in economy ? 
  the worse thing that ever happened to greece is accepting this `` generous '' offer . 
  it has nothing to do with `` racketerring '' , it has nothing , i repeat nothing to do with money . 
  even in the most optimistic scenario the money gained will be a drop in the bucket . 
  what it does have to do with is moral obligation . 
  germany has treated greece in these last 5 years as being on the losing side of a major war . 
  german officials , the `` troika '' walked into athens with a power of a conqueror entering a defeated people . 
  treating greek government as just tools to enforce german policy . 
  forcing the previous government to sell of state buildings that were being used by the government and then forcing to pay rent for occupying those buildings . 
  these are things that a winner does to a loser of a war . 
  then you have the germans declaring that all debt is a `` moral '' obligation and that greece must do its `` moral '' duty to pay everything , which is fine . 
  . but the manner that it was done by , is disgraceful . 
  now , the greeks have turned the table and decided that it is also your `` moral '' duty to pay for the 0 % interest loan germany took in 1941 . 
  note , germany had a deal with greece to pay for the 0 % interest loan once it was unified . 
  there has been many people in greece since 1990 fighting for this but they have been shut down by the previous puppet governments . 
  you have a `` moral '' duty to pay those debts , just like we have a `` moral '' duty to pay ours , and an international court will decide what is owed . 
  . but again it is not about money , most likely the money will be close to nothing . 
  greece has been active in trying to get reperations since 1990 when germany unified , it stopped being a issue since greece was accepted into eu but now has become a major issue again due to austerity and troika treating greece like it lost a major war . 
  those `` fallen '' did more to save europe than 10x larger and more modern nations when it came down to action , do n't ever forget that as the past always repeats itself . 
  field marshal zhukov  `` if the russian people managed to raise resistance at the doors of moscow to halt and reverse the german torrent , they owe it to the greek people , who delayed the german divisions during the time they could bring us to our knees . '' sir robert antony eden , minister of war and the exterior of britain 1940-1945 , prime minister of britain 1955-1957 :  `` regardless of what the future historians shall say , what we can say now , is that greece gave mussolini an unforgettable lesson , that she was the motive for the revolution in yugoslavia , that she held the germans in the mainland and in crete for six weeks , that she upset the chronological order of all german high command 's plans and thus brought a general reversal of the entire course of the war and we won . '', 
  ( paraphrased from a speech of his to the british parliament on 24/09/1942 ) sir harold leofric george alexander , british marshal during wwii :  `` it would not be an exaggeration to say that greece upset the plans of germany in their entirety forcing her to postpone the attack on russia for six weeks . 
  we wonder what would have been soviet union 's position without greece . '', 
  ( paraphrased from a speech of his to the british parliament on 28 october 1941 ), 
  the best option would have been to default in 2008 and then `` suck it up '' as you say . 
  unfortunately our great leaders of the time thought it was a wise idea to gain 300 billion euros in loans and shrink the economy by 30 % . 
  5-6 years later and it was found to be the wrong move and the population decided to bring in a new government outside the traditional 2 party system to deal with the mess , and here we are now  also let me just say one thing , greece has lost 30 % of its economy that is worse than the peak of the american great depression . 
  besides a few riots a few years ago , crime has gone down and the people are still holding it together . 
  is that not the definition of `` sucking it up '' ? 
  i can guarantee you that the majority of northern countries would be in civil war if they lost 30 % of their economy . 
  the vast majority of tax evasion is done from wealthy , generalizing every greek as a `` tax cheat '' is the reason why people are angry . 
  [ during the crisis years the tax burden on the poor increased by 337 % while the burden on upper-income classes increased by only 9 % .

  completely pointless without danny devito imo, 
  mariupol is the industrial heart-land of the east from what i have read , and also has ( i believe ) one of the largest steel factories in europe . 
  hopefully things do not escalate here since there would be no choice for poroshenko than to declare total war . 
  does most of the population even know that he tried to set up a false flag attack in syria to bring turkey into war and then banned youtube when tapes were released ? 
  how did he get away with it ? 
  is he some kind of master-mind politician ? 
  you lost a lot of money , 
  that , and also most of the wealthy people in greece are part of the tourism industry , hotels , bars , clubs , etc that are ** extremely ** profitable . 
  they are unable to just move their operations abroad like some tech firm can , they are glued to greece . 
  what do you think of varoufakis [ `` decentralized europeanization '' ] ( http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2015/03/15/presenting-an-agenda-for-europe-at-ambrosetti-lake-como-14th-march-2015/ ) plan ? 
  in the long-term yes , but 2015 is a crunch year for debt payments , if greece can get past 2015 then everything will be very sustainable as the next 5 years debt payments are tiny compared to 2015 . 
  syriza hopes to get 3-4 billion in tax evader money by the end of summer which is crucial if greece is to make it . 
  [ from what i could find ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/02/24/former-finmin-papakonstantinou-to-appear-before-special-court-tomorrow/ )  the judges of the special court , which is convening for the first time in more than 20 years , were drawn by the greek parliament . 
  presiding will be nikolaos passos and the prosecutor will be xeni dimitriou-vassilopoulou . 
  it should be noted that the last time a minister was referred to the special court was 25 years ago , in 1989 , regarding the infamous koskotas case . 
  those referred were menios koutsogiorgas , panagiotis roumeliotis , giorgos petsos and dimitris tsovolas . 
  this is pretty big news the court used for this trial has not been in use since the early 1980 's , it is considered a `` special court '' . 
  fine but do not blame me for the articles content , i just share things i find interesting and think would create discussion . 
  other top news for today is greek ministers visiting beijing , greek road deaths down 37 percent and new plans to establish engineering military corps . 
  none of which this subreddit would find interesting or discuss .

  as much chance of that as crimea returning to ukraine :p, 
  did erdogan give you permission to post here ? 
  i am reporting you to local erdoganistan police, 
  this, 
  i will see if i can find any , [ check out this article on it ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_crete )  from the very first day of the battle , everywhere on the island , cretan civilians -- men , women , children , priests , monks , and even nuns , armed and otherwise -- joined the battle with whatever weapons were at hand . 
  in some cases , ancient matchlock rifles which had last been used against the turks were dug up from their hiding places and pressed into action . 
  in other cases , civilians went into action armed only with what they could gather from their kitchens or barns , and several german parachutists were knifed or clubbed to death in the olive groves that dotted the island . 
  in one recorded case of extreme brutality against the german fallschirmj\u00e4ger , an elderly cretan man clubbed a parachutist to death with his walking cane before the german could disentangle himself from his parachute lines . 
  [ 70 ] in another , a priest and his son broke into a village museum and took two rifles from the era of the balkan wars and sniped at german paratroops at one of the landing zones . 
  while the priest would aim and shoot at german paratroopers with one rifle , his son would re-load the other . 
  the cretans soon supplemented their makeshift weapons with captured german small arms taken from the bodies of dead paratroops and glider troops . 
  their actions were not limited to harassment -- civilians also played a significant role in the greek counter-attacks at kastelli hill and paleochora ; the british and new zealand advisors at these locations were hard pressed to prevent massacres . 
  civilian action also checked the germans to the north and west of heraklion , and in the town centre itself . 
  [ 71 ]   this was the first occasion in the war that the germans encountered widespread and unrestrained resistance from a civilian population , and for a period of time , it unbalanced them . 
  however , once they had recovered from their shock , the german paratroopers reacted with equal ferocity , killing many cretan civilians . 
  two examples of such extreme brutallity towards cretan civilians are the holocaust of viannos ( greek : \u039f\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03b1\u03cd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0392\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5 ) and the massacre of kondomari ( greek : \u03a3\u03c6\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u039a\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03af ) . 
  the holocaust of viannos was a mass extermination campaign launched by the german forces against the civilian residents of around 20 villages located in the areas east of viannos and west of ierapetra provinces on crete . 
  the killings , with a death toll in excess of 500 , were carried out on 14 -- 16 september 1943 by wehrmacht units . 
  they were accompanied by the burning of most villages , and the looting and destruction of harvests . 
  [ 72 ] [ 73 ] the massive loss of life amounted to one of the deadliest massacres during the axis occupation of greece .
