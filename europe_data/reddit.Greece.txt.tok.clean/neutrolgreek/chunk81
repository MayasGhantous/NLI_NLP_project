  it was ordered by generalleutnant friedrich-wilhelm m\u00fcller , in retaliation for the support and involvement of the local population in the cretan resistance . 
  m\u00fcller , who earned the nickname `` the butcher of crete '' , was executed after the war for his part in the massacre . 
    furthermore , as most cretan partisans wore no uniforms or identifying insignia such as armbands or headbands , the germans felt free of all of the constraints implied by the hague conventions and killed both armed and unarmed civilians indiscriminately . 
  i did n't want to make it seem that they did not fight , there was french/yugoslav very brave fighters for years during occupation . 
  i am only talking about the pre-occupation fight . 
  yugoslav lasted 3 days in ww2 , greece lasted 330 days, 
  i find it sad that greece is not even mentioned italy had the order to take greece in 7-10 days as they had crushed the rest of the balkans in less than 3 days . 
  greece politely said no and fighting began which raged on for 300 days of intense guerilla warfare killing 150,000 axis forces and disabling 100,000 + more . 
  hitler then had to send in an entire german blitzkrieg division to take greece in 30 days of brutal warfare which delayed the invasion of the soviet union to late summer instead of early spring 1941 . 
  this caught the nazi 's in the winter and rest is history . 
  and yet the country with 330 days in fighting ( 2nd most was norway with 60 days ) , is never mentioned . 
  i will simply put it to the leaders of that time to decide this poll ** adolf hitler : ** `` for the sake of historical truth i must verify that only the greeks , of all the adversaries who confronted us , fought with bold courage and highest disregard of death . . '' ( from speech he delivered to reichstag on 4 may 1941 ) ** winston churchill : ** `` the word heroism i am afraid does not render the least of those acts of self-sacrifice of the greeks , which were the defining factor in the victorious outcome of the common struggle of the nations , during wwii , for the human freedom and dignity . 
  if it were not for the bravery of the greeks and their courage , the outcome of wwii would be undetermined . '', 
  ( paraphrased from one of his speeches to the british parliament on 24 april 1941 ) `` until now we used to say that the greeks fight like heroes . 
  now we shall say : the heroes fight like greeks . '', 
  ( from a speech he delivered from the bbc in the first days of the greco-italian war ) ** joseph vissarionovich tzougasvili stalin : ** `` i am sorry because i am getting old and i shall not live long to thank the greek people , whose resistance decided wwii . '', 
  ( from a speech of his broadcast by the moscow radio station on 31 january 1943 after the victory of stalingrad and the capitulation of marshal paulus ), 
  how peaceful of you, 
  under this law i believe you have a choice between paying in 100 installments or paying in one lump sum the entire amount due with a decent cut of total . 
  also this is for past taxes that have been avoided , not for current/new ones . 
  the logic is to push people to make a compromise between paying in one lump sum with no penalties or in 100 installments . 
  that list shows it in 4th place though, 
  turkics are asiatic people , greeks have no asian genetics if that is what you mean . 
  identity in greece the last thousand years was based on religion , so if a greek converted to islam ( and many did ) he would be called a turk . 
  there are many ethnic greeks living in thrace who are muslim and they are called turks not greeks . 
  so no , greeks are not christian turks , turks were and still are a culture based around islam and they did not convert to christianity which was the religion of peasants and 2nd class . 
  if you like any genetic studies i can link some but this entire thread is pretty idiotic to begin with . 
  edit : [ here is the turkic/asian genetics in population of europe ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yqigd5t.png ) [ and the dominant genetic in the population ] ( http://i.imgur.com/whbdybk.png ), 
  that is basically one of the cores of varoufakis `` decentralized europeanization '' plan [ read the entire plan here ] ( http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2015/03/15/presenting-an-agenda-for-europe-at-ambrosetti-lake-como-14th-march-2015/ ) , it is a great read . 
  it is known, 
  i never said i was left-wing , i am not . 
  but you are free to participate like many others do, 
  lots of left-wing , pro-immigrant people post there . 
  there are tons of interesting debates over there . 
  the reason it is nice to have a place like that is that it is difficult to have an open debate here about certain issues . 
  not candy , [ but has to be this ] ( http://www.retrodb.gr/ark/sites/default/files/styles/watermarked/public/drakoulinia_f.jpg ), 
  i really do n't think it is a grab at political points , he is likely sending a message to his own party with doing things like this . 
  how can anyone in his own party demand any form of luxury when their leader takes cheap flights ? 
  if this is just a one time thing , then it is cheap but i guess we 'll see . 
  that seating space looks like a regular commercial airplane , not even first class . 
  i assume that is not a private jet right ? 
  i see , on the bright side the igb ( interconnector greece-bulgaria ) will be complete by 2018 . 
  bulgaria has already confirmed the purchase of 1 billion cubic meters of caspain sea gas will go through the tap pipeline in greece and connect with the igb . 
  which were the 3 ? 
  i am assuming south-stream and nabucco which has recently been replaced with the russia  greece pipeline . 
  but what is the 3rd ? 
  greece is not `` trolling '' - they want to start selling the vast amounts of produce ( fruits/veggies ) that greece has to offer and create tens of thousands of jobs, 
  poor relations, 
  the whole point of a prank is to hide your intentions until the `` reveal '' or act . 
  of course they would deny it until this new video was released in op and got 100 million views and huge publicity/etc . 
  that was from march 16 before this new video from op was released . 
  the big `` surprise '' of this video was showing that the croatian organizers/uploaders were part of this prank . 
  so it would be obvious that a few days ago they would deny varoufakis claim that it was doctored . 
  timeline : video uploaded after 2 years  week later v for varoufakis viral video  varoufakis says finger was doctored  video uploaders deny it  new video releasing showing they were in fact involved, 
  [ that response does n't prove much as you can see here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ziawe/varoufakis_middlefinger_faked_by_the_same_german/cpjc3kd ) the main reason i will give varoufakis the benefit of the doubt is that he seemed legitimately confused when he saw the footage and said it was doctored . 
  that upload was done by the people who doctored it . 
  that is the entire point . 
  the talk was done in 2013 , video uploaded last month and the v for varoufakis music video came out a week later using that doctored upload . 
  now this video in op shows that both were part of the prank / u/retard _ capsule [ put it well in this post here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ziawe/varoufakis_middlefinger_faked_by_the_same_german/cpj8xok ), 
  energy geo-politics is extremely relevant , i think many in eu are starting to figure that out . 
  [ this is the full pipeline ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5n0abn4.jpg ), 
  if you think greeks sit around blaming `` foreigners '' then you have never spoken to one in real life . 
  the blame is all on the previous governments . 
  syriza is a different matter and they are being very aggressive but that appears to be the strategy they are using for negotiations . 
  varoufakis ordered the attack of germany, 
  it was very nice of them to donate to a charity , but no need to make a huge drama out of it, 
   why are muslim women , black men , white working-class women not fast-tracked into teaching ? 
  these people all too often find themselves as teaching support staff , while people from less appropriate backgrounds and less genuine connections to the children are trusted to teach . 
  there are just 30 black male head teachers across britain 's 21,600 state schools and 127 black female heads . 
  it 's another example of the subtle but ubiquitous class privilege and institutionalised racism that pervades british society . 
  those evil british , jihad john has nothing to do with religion and that is racist to imply . 
  those damn racist brits causing all this trouble !, 
  i am not 100 % positive but i believe it was created as a way for fast communication in the european scientific laboratory , possibly cern back in the 70 's . 
  there was a need for instant communication between two computers so they invented the protocols that would come to be the base for the internet .

  it does not really matter how good your team is on any single day since everything goes in cycles , you might not be good now but in 3-4 years you might win world championship . 
  all that matters is a good sport culture and experienced coaches , preferably ex-players with experience . 
  greece national team has been on a downslide the last 3-4 years but this year there are some fresh stars in the team from nba . 
  antentonkoumpo , papanikolau , kufos , calathes . 
  lithuania has one of the best new stars of the nba , motejunas so the team will likely be built around him for next decade . 
  we shall have a basketball match to decide who stays, 
  the main cause of this is from ww2 reparations/forced-loan demands , which shifted public opinion . 
  i think tsipras could have waited a while longer before bringing it up . 
  he wo n't be getting replaced , at this point there is a higher chance of putin being replaced . 
  kind of , the troika has been split up ( through intense negotiations ) , into the `` institutions '' and the `` brussels group '' . 
  this makes one group the deal-makers ( institutions ) , and this is only done in brussels . 
  and the deal-enforcers/over-sight is the brussels group . 
  this has over-come one of the major if not the biggest obstacle between shauble/djisselbloem and varoufakis which was close to tearing apart relations . 
  the brussels group is at this very moment in athens in the hilton hotel for the next 10-15 days where they will be helping syriza finalize the reform list due by april 20th . 
  [ they are not `` first europeans '' but they do have the largest amount of `` first european '' genetics ] ( https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/reference-populations/ ) southern countries like spain , portugal and greece have 30-40 % of these `` first european '' genetics , northern countries like danes and finns have 50-60 % . 
  by first europeans , they mean the original hunter-gatherers that arrived into the european continent around 35,000 years ago . 
  at this time europe was heavily populated by neanderthals . 
  there was what many believe to be a 10,000 years war between these hunter-gatherer humans and neanderthals leading to modern europeans having between 3-5 % neanderthal genetics also from inter-mixing . 
  the over-sight committee did not get thrown out , it has been re-named to `` brussels group '' and they are currently in athens for the next 10 days . 
  the problem is that a lot of these `` youths '' do not hate isis, 
  another interpretation of the pictures from my point of view is of a couple living a normal life in greece , that is what the goal of syriza is afterall , to bring back normalcy . 
  all of this controversy seems a bit much , not just this article but all the media going crazy over it . 
  i get the hypocrisy of the `` glamour '' photo session but i do n't think this compromises varoufakis pledge about the humanitarian crisis . 
   in short , while the ecb is doing its best within the parameters it has been given , its ` best ' is unlikely to be good enough .
