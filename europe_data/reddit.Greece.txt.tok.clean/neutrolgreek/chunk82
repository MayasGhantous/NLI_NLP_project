  something else is needed . 
  allow me to foreshadow what that ` something ' might be . 
  i call it a process of decentralised europeanisation . 
  the long and the short of it is simple : we need to simulate a federal euro governance without federation , without further loss of national sovereignty , and under the existing treaties . 
    presently , europe is sadly caught up in a false dilemma . 
  on the one hand , there is the standard view that the way we are going in europe today is leading us out of the crisis and it 's working . 
  i do n't share that view . 
  the other part of the false dilemma is to say that federation is the only alternative . 
  i do n't think that is possible , and i do n't think it 's desirable , either . 
  thankfully there is a third option which i like to refer to as ` decentralized europeanization ' . 
  50 % tax is being generous , i would go with 75 % but otherwise i agree,

  well , the difference is that instead of `` troika '' , there is now the institutions and the brussels group , this now seperates the troika into the deal-makers and the deal-enforcers whereas before the troika were simply the deal-enforcers with no chance of negotiations . 
  it is a pretty significant change and has settled a major rift between shauble/djisselbloem and varoufakis that was close to tearing apart relations . 
  brussels group is the technical staff that ** goes ** to athens , they are in athens at this very moment and will be there for 10 more days . 
  the `` institutions '' is where the high level negotiations are done , and that is done in brussels .

  the major problem is a `` graccident '' . 
  `` graccident '' is apparently a term being used by merkel and her allies to suggest that if greece were to be forced out the euro currency it would be due to mis-communication or political shenanigans instead of anything financial or due to reforms .

  medvedev does not hold any actual power , as in none of the kremlin clans hold allegiance to him , only to putin . 
  medvedev would be used as a pawn by whichever oligarch clan comes out on top . 
  this shows the scary nature of russia , the entire house of cards rests on the shoulders of one man . 
  once putin is gone , it is going to be a free for all of clan warfare and civil strife , possibly war . 
  if something happened to obama , merkel , tsipras , hollande , etc there would be a 24 hour shock period followed by `` business as usual '' . 
  this is not a good sign for the future , even if putin is fine and lives another 30 years . 
   ps : i have sometimes the feeling that some greeks dont understand that merkel and sch\u00e4uble are not the worst that could happen in germany same for germans that do n't understand greek politics . 
   they been cheating the books all along with no reforms [ greece ranked # 1 in reforms by oecd ] ( http://coppolacomment.blogspot.co.uk/2015/02/reforms-bloody-reforms.html ), 
  paywall  fearing instability in the balkans , the german chancellor angela merkel is determined to prevent a situation in which greece exits the euro area by accident amid rising tensions between the two countries over financing , according to senior officials in berlin . 
    the officials stressed that if greece was to leave the single currency it would be because there is not enough common ground on how the eurozone should work , rather than missing the moveable targets around repayment deadlines and reform commitments that have been set with creditors . 
   `` this is a political decision , there will be no ` graccident , ''' a well-placed official , who is familiar with the chancellor 's thinking , said , using the term that has recently been coined to describe the possibility of greece leaving the eurozone as a result of misunderstandings and political tensions . 
   fears of greece leaving the currency bloc have risen again recently as the country is struggling to find enough money repay its creditors , and progress on the implementation of structural reforms -- a requirement for releasing funds in the current bailout-package -- is stalling . 
  greek politicians , meanwhile , are irritating their german counterparts by threatening to seize german property as compensation for crimes during the german occupation of greece . 
   while merkel is understood to believe that the euro area is now better equipped to weather the market turbulence that could ensue if athens departs the euro-area , the possible geopolitical consequences of such a development have become a major concern in the chancellery . 
  the main fear is that the southern balkan region could be destabilized and greece -- a member of nato -- could fall under russian influence . 
    as a consequence , the german government is ready to back unorthodox solutions to prevent greece from running out of cash . 
  these are said to include increasing the limits of short-term treasury bills that athens could issue and sell to greek banks , which then post them as collateral with the european central bank , temporary capital controls in case of a bank-run , paying out funds from the current program ahead of schedule and delaying debt repayments to the international monetary fund . 
  the government wants to avoid going in this direction , but it is not ruling out that these instrument could be used if there is no other way to keep greece in the euro area . 
   such support would only be granted , however , if there is political agreement in europe that greece remains a member of the currency area , which from the german side 's perspective requires a clear commitment to implementing reforms and accepting the established bailout infrastructure . 
  in this case , germany remains ready to back a third financial support package to cover funding shortfalls in the coming years , the officials said . 
   berlin still expects that enough common ground could yet be found with athens especially as merkel is understood to have established a good working relationship with prime minister alexis tsipras of greece . 
    the german government is also ready to agree on a lower primary surplus target and leave greece more leeway when it comes to defining and implementing reforms and -- at a later stage -- also a reduction in its debt burden . 
    the chancellor 's main opponent in the government has been the finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , who is understood to have repeatedly pondered the idea of forcing greece to leave the euro-area . 
  schaeuble -- who , like the chancellor , is a member of the centre-right christian democratic union ( cdu ) -- is probably the most pro-integrationist member of merkel 's cabinet and believes that adherence to rules and procedure is a condition for a closer union . 
   schaeuble is understood to believe that the greek government may not be capable of running the country in a way that is compatible with more political and economic integration in the euro area . 
  he laid out his ideas of a `` core europe '' in a 1994 paper in which he argued that a `` core '' of members , willing to share more sovereignty , should be allowed to move on if needed . 
    merkel 's opposition to a ` grexit ' has led schaeuble to abandon his plans , and more recently he , too , is understood to have become more concerned about the geopolitical environment . 
  the differences between the chancellery and the finance ministry have hence narrowed . 
  this is why , despite his public sabre-rattling , schaeuble played a constructive role in the negotiations that led to the recent extension of the greek bailout package . 
   nevertheless , in the german government 's view there is a risk that the negotiations might reveal fundamental differences with greece that can not be bridged . 
  in this case , germany would be ready to let greece go . 
  the finance ministry is understood to have worked on contingency plans in case greece leaves the euro-area . 
  under this scenario , germany would call for the use of eu instruments to support the country outside the currency area . 
   assuming that greece stays in the euro area and needs more financial support , merkel is likely to come under increasing pressure from lawmakers of her own party . 
  there is little willingness among conservative members of parliament to put more money at risk to help greece as voters are also losing their patience . 
  so for the moment , no change in policy is envisaged   `` we will take this risk , '' another official close to merkel said . 
  with the social-democratic party ( spd ) -- the cdu 's coalition partner in the federal government -- generally more open to helping greece , the chancellor will most likely be able to secure a majority in the bundestag if a vote on a third program is held . 
   the expectation that greece will remain in the eurozone remains the view of most investors . 
  a recent report by standard & poor 's , the credit rating agency , said a ` grexit ' was not its base-case scenario .

  `` there is no reason for concern ... even if there is no timely disbursement of a tranche , greece will meet its obligations , '' he said . 
  regarding the meeting concluded earlier , he said that `` we are here in order for the oecd to put its stamp on the reforms that the greek government wants to push on and i believe that this stamp in our passport will be very significant to build mutual trust with our creditors . '' i find the first part interesting , it is hard to believe though . 
   commenting on the oecd 's role , varoufakis explained that it will provide technical know-how and seminars on various issues , such as taxation , corruption and reforms in order to compose an efficient program . 
  i am not sure if `` reparations '' is the correct term either as i do not think the greek cases rests on taking money for damage done to infra-structure or human lives . 
  i think the main claim by the greek side is for the 0 % interest loan germany took once it occupied greece in late spring 1941 . 
  greek government decided it was a good idea to go crazy on military spending , so yes . 
  [ absolutely not `` upside down '' ] ( http://italychronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/eurostat-productivity-europe.jpg ) greece ranks in the middle pack in europe for productivity . 
  you can not expect a tourism heavy economy to be super productive compared to a export based economy . 
  there is a huge problem with tourist businesses including clubs , bars , hotels , etc not giving out proper receipts . 
  one of the new reforms under discussion this week is for a lottery based receipt system where you can use your receipts for a chance to win a lottery . 
  greece collected 44 billion in 2013 and 2014 even with a shrinking economy . 
  the major problem is wealthy schemes and tax avoidance . 
  5,000 legal cases of tax evasion are responsible for tens of billions of tax evasion . 
  greece will still be in the eu if they exit the eurozone , only now they will have no reason to even attempt to tow the eu line . 
  also war reparations is not `` gibberish '' , greece tried to settle this matter in 1990 and was met with legal tactics to avoid any solution . 
  the main question is whether the 0 % interest loan germany stole from greek banks in 1941 is still active or not .
