  greece has a gdp/capita of 23,000 $ . 
  serbia gdp/capita is 3-4 ,000 $ the economic performance perfectly matched the standard of living . 
  greeks have the lowest or in the top 3 lowest household/private debts on earth . 
  the issue is government debt also known as public debt which stands at 170 % gdp . 
  this is due to many things , but i think that blank check military spending played the biggest role in this debt , not standard of living . 
  because athens airport is simply one of the best airports on earth for one reason , it has won dozens of prizes in websites/magazines as # 1 airport in its category . 
  besides that china has large plans to transform piraeus harbor in athens into its shipping hub , it would make sense to transform the nearby airport into its plane hub in combination which would give a centralized location for chinese corporations in europe . 
  lastly , nothing will be `` fire-sold '' or `` cheap '' . 
  the first thing syriza did in office was to stop the piraeus-china deal as they found the deal unacceptable and `` cheap '' . 
  tsipras will be visiting beijing in may to meet the prime minister where i assume the deals will be reviewed . 
  most likely the airport will not be sold away , but i can see the chinese being allowed to build their own section of the airport to manage their airplanes and logistics .

  china wants to make athens airport its plane hub into europe , just like they want to make [ piraeus harbor ] ( http://i.imgur.com/n21dhdo.jpg ) in athens their shipping hub . 
  from these two locations they can manage their european operations for shipping and transport . 
  it is pretty ambitious , tsipras will be visiting beijing in may and i assume these topics will be the main discussion .

  most of that money was used to pay for the civil war which caused even more destruction than ww2 . 
  they just shifted their eyes away from islands/historic sites which were impossible and onto the greek energy infra-structure and other ultilities which they want to buy up for pennies .

  they are obsessed with greece selling off the entire country for pennies in all these `` deals '' so called `` bailouts '' . 
  the worst of all is trying to force greece to sell off its entire energy infrastructure and companies literally 1-2 years before greece will transform its economy into a energy based economy , with 5 pipelines in the works and dozens of gas wells/lng/hubs / etcx10 in the works . 
  i do n't care if greece crashes as long as we did n't sell out like new democracy was planning to do . 
  you can re-build as long as you own your own country , which germany for some reason is strongly against . 
  march 11 , 2015 - [ greece 's new government is `` radically opposed '' to the privatization of certain businesses , particularly in the energy and infrastructure sectors ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_11/03/2015_548096 )  lafazanis added that `` honestly , i have n't understood why for some schools of thought , privatizations have become synonymous with reforms . '', 
    he argued that what he called the `` neoliberal deregulation in the energy market , which occurred particularly during the recent ( bailout ) years with the insistence of the ( european ) commission and the troika '' had prolonged and exacerbated greece 's financial crisis and energy poverty in the country . 
  if you respected law you would have dealt with this issue in 1990 , you people like to boast about `` morals '' when it comes to these bailouts . 
  do not be angry when this matter goes to court , after all you are a `` state of law '' correct ? 
  this is not about reparations to victims , it is about forced loans and damage to infra-structure . 
  the same is absolutely not true for greece and this matter will be left for a court to decide , not on random forums . 
  [ what went wrong ? 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/26/opinion/paul-krugman-ending-greeces-nightmare.html?_r=0 ) i fairly often encounter assertions to the effect that greece did n't carry through on its promises , that it failed to deliver the promised spending cuts . 
  nothing could be further from the truth . 
  in reality , greece imposed savage cuts in public services , wages of government workers and social benefits . 
  thanks to repeated further waves of austerity , public spending was cut much more than the original program envisaged , and it 's currently about 20 percent lower than it was in 2010 .

  nyet , there is no procedure for leaving the eurozone or leaving the eu . 
  none . 
  the only legal way to leave the eu is put into detail here :  article 50 ( 1 ) teu provides simply that any member state can withdraw from the eu in accordance with its own constitutional rules . 
  the key part of article 50 is the next paragraph , which states that :   a member state which decides to withdraw shall notify the european council of its intention . 
  in the light of the guidelines provided by the european council , the union shall negotiate and conclude an agreement with that state , setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal , taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the union . 
  that agreement shall be negotiated in accordance with article 218 ( 3 ) of the treaty on the functioning of the european union . 
  it shall be concluded on behalf of the union by the council , acting by a qualified majority , after obtaining the consent of the european parliament . 
  greece will not choose to withdraw from the eu [ article 50 confirms the possibility of member states to leave the eu , and it is clearly the only legal route to leave , as a matter of eu law . 
  there 's no possibility to throw a member state out of the eu against its will , although its membership could be suspended if there are serious and continued breaches of human rights , democracy and the rule of law \\ ( article 7 teu \\ ) . 
  that clause has never been used to date either .

  no matter what happens , greece will stay in the eu the eurozone is the only thing that is on the wire . 
  nobody gives a fuck, 
  this has crossed my mind, 
  greece has gone through 100x worse than this , even if forced out of eurozone it will be barely a hiccup compared to other shit that has happened . 
  a few bean counters in berlin will never destroy greece , being forced out the eurozone would be the best thing to happen to greece in the long-term . 
  good thing those `` bailouts '' got greece out of recession . 
  greece wo n't leave the eu if it is forced out the eurozone . 
  the only thing that will happen is that it becomes a bric 's trojan horse inside the eu, 
  greece will stay in the eu no matter what , euro currency or not . 
  if greece is forced out the eurozone then the `` games '' will truly begin , 
  you can not `` cut out '' greece under any circumstance , not only is it impossible due to cyprus veto if everyone ganged up on greece but greece would never choose to leave also . 
  greece will stay in the eu and use it its advantage . 
  greece ca n't leave the eu nor can it be kicked/forced out . 
  eurozone is a different matter . 
  the t-bill 's will roll over , i doubt anything else will,
