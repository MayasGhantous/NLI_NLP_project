  `` send jihadists '' . 
  and you call others gullible ? 
  if greece is crushed , then there will be no money for border protection and every migrant in greece will flood out . 
  that was the point, 
  it wo n't be over with greece , the moment greece leaves the euro-zone , every anti-eu party will be given the keys to victory . 
  greece would only just be the end of the beginning . 
  there already is a `` hot-line '' which gets tens of thousands of calls every year . 
  it was started around 5 years ago . 
  they are not `` collectors '' basically there is a massive problem with tax evading/no receipts in aegean/ionian islands and other touristy regions in the hotels , bars , clubs , restaurants , etc. 
  it is basically the `` system '' . 
  these `` non-professionals '' are people who are given a two months temporary position and they are wired for sound/video to catch cheats in the tourist areas . 
  the evidence is then given to the professional tax agents for prosecution . 
  weird , it was working fine earlier [ hereis new link ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/03/08/greek-legislation-stops-commercialization-of-hydrogen-car/ ), 
  [ the situation at the present time is as follows ] ( http://dialogosmedia.org/?p=1391 ) :  when we first began our efforts in 2008 , we attempted to register our vehicle in order to be able to circulate it on the streets here in greece . 
  when we attempted this , however , we were told to go to another country , in order to receive the requisite certifications from there that the vehicle is safe , and then to come back to greece in order to get registered . 
  this of course is not possible for us , and from what i understand , nothing has changed in terms of the legal framework in greece since that time . 
   this , unfortunately , is a clear indication of the lack of a legal framework which would allow anyone to construct and develop a vehicle in greece and to circulate it on the road with greek license plates . 
  it is extremely unfortunate that our vehicle is able to participate in international competitions , on tracks with much higher safety standards than ordinary roads , and yet , we are unable to circulate the vehicle on the road in greece . 
  no , you really can not argue that, 
  i do n't think it has to do with papers , basically if greece is crushed economically then pretty much everyone including greeks will try to escape . 
  the migrants who are already struggling in greece will see absolutely no reason to stay and 90 % of them will likely leave immediately . 
  many are already leaving at a rapid pace , albanians who are the most successful immigrant group in greece are leaving , so i can imagine the less fortunate migrants are trying to also . 
  part group-think , part individual `` culture '' watch this interview of a couple of dutch `` youths '' done recently - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ky2h7dr8-g, 
  `` we wo n't do them the favor . 
  the finance minister of greece is yanis varoufakis . 
  if they want someone styled after gikas hardouvelis , who says ` yes ' to everything then they will be disappointed , '' say radical left coalition ( syriza ) sources . 
  these are not government jobs , it is a 2 month temp position where you are trained for a short period and then attempt to collect evidence against a place of business suspected of evading . 
  the same is true for greece , the problem is that tax authorities are so deeply under-staffed and the problem is so wide-spread . 
  especially on the aegean islands hotels/bars/etc and other touristy areas , nothing could be really done , but this program basically gives tax authorities an endless amount of dependable workers and evidence for prosecutions . 
  [ german mp 's have also proposed a 500 euro coupon for german tourists to go to greece ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/03/06/german-mps-propose-e500-incentive-for-holidaymakers-to-greece/ ) a german could easily sign up for this undercover tax program and the 500 euro program and go to greece for free for 1 summer . 
  made a mistake in title , this is not just for greek citizens , also tourists will be allowed to enter this program although i am not sure of the requirements . 
  i assume being a eu citizens will be necessary though [ full list of reforms sent today by varoufakis to disselbloem ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/files/greece-letter-to-eurogroup-pdf.pdf ), 
  yeh , [ i had to create a new thread for this for discussion ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y6i2b/new_undercover_tax_police_to_be_deployed_in/ ) tourists will also be hired and be paid hourly , this is pretty amazing .

  as the 11-page letter varoufakis sent to eurogroup president jeroen dijsselbloem earlier today reads , they will serve as undercover tax inspectors !, 
  [ german mps propose $ 500 incentive for holidaymakers to greece ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/03/06/german-mps-propose-e500-incentive-for-holidaymakers-to-greece/ )  according to the german mps , german holidaymakers on their return from greece would be reimbursed 500 euros by the german state on presentation of restaurant and hotel bills -- on condition that the hotel and restaurant in question have paid their taxes . 
  this way , they claim , the german tourists will help greece fight tax evasion . 
  [ german bookings are already up 12.8 % compared to last year ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_04/03/2015_547860 ) , i wonder how much more it would go if you get 500 euros coupon for going . 
  i can easily see it reaching in the hundreds of % increase , 500 euros is nothing to ignore . 
  edit : [ tldr of varoufakis reforms list ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/03/06/greek-finmin-varoufakis-seven-reforms-list-submitted-to-eurogroup-president-dijsselbloem/ ) edit 2 : a new tax police is being created using non-professional citizens in a non-confrontational role . 
  to quote the reforms list . 
  a greek citizen will be eligible for a 2 month undercover role without chance of being re-hired . 
  they will be wired for sound/video with the goal of evidence being used in legal cases by the full-time professional tax authorities . 
  i think i just heard every aegean island hotel and bar owner shitting their pants, 
  based italia, 
  that blog putting slovakia ahead of greece shows how useless it is 51 greek naval vessels vs zero for slovakia 1,700 modern main battle tanks vs 30 soviet era tanks 2,187 armoured fighting vehicles vs 327 1,928 artillery units vs 68 29 attack helis vs 13 287 modern fighter jets vs 12 but according to that 100 % professional website slovakia is a powerhouse compared to greece . 
  i do n't think it is even technically possible to be as terrible as that website . 
  calling it trash would be a compliment, 
  which is why i hope military spending goes down . 
  i am pleasantly suprised by the maturity turkey showed this week after they admitted it was an accident that they declared a notam of aegean air/naval space in the middle of greek islands for military live-fire exercises . 
  greece and turkey are building tens of billions $ worth of pipelines together over the next few years , which will make the prospect of war even more impossible . 
  by global fire power . 
  literally a blog . 
  that site is useless for the sole fact that according to that website a 1965 soviet era tank is equal with a leopard 2 a6 built in 2015 with modern thermal/ir vision sensors/etc . 
  you can not compare raw numbers like that , just look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_of_the_european_union the numbers on global fire power are also out of date , but still the core of that website is flawed . 
  greece has a near equal navy with uk and the largest air-force in europe and 2nd highest tank force ( but # 1 modern tank force ), 
  serbia is based, 
  i agree that it was not necessary on that scale , military spending appears to already have been cut for 2015 which is a positive sign . 
  it is the first time since cyprus where greece will spend below the 2 % nato amount . 
  because of cyprus , it caused a huge exestential threat which was filled with a blank check on military spending . 
  just compare the various militaries http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_of_the_european_union, 
  the same people who fund `` islamic universities '' ( saudis ) do not even allow a single church to be built in their home countries . 
  the debt was pushed from banks onto citizens in the guise of future growth and economic prosperity . 
  it is hard to get financial stability when every decade there is a major military threat needing mass spending for . 
  as you can see in that article a major war caused run-away military spending the cyprus invasion triggered one of the biggest military spending sprees in history . 
  around 500-600 billion was spent on military equipment . 
  while much wealthier countries in northern europe had barely spent a fraction of that on military and in return their military is a complete joke , greece ended up fucked because of this spending spree . 
  if greece had not spent even half that money on military the situation today would be completely different . 
  eu/nato should be the stable force greece needs so no more military spending like that is required .

  [ 2015 is the mount olympus of debt ] ( http://graphics.wsj.com/greece-debt-timeline/?mod=e2fb ) , if syriza can manage to get through this year alive without needing a 3rd bail-out then all is well . 
   `` your new greek government is brazen , impertinent and behaves like a mob of crude , mannerless jerks , '' this isnt really wrong , but i prefer it to the previous submissive government of yes-men  nor stepping foot in your premises , '' german bookings for greece are already 1-2 % higher than last year , this person is an idiot . 
  edit : i was wrong , not 1-2 % [ vacation bookings for greece among germans have increased by 12.8 percent compared to last year , according to data presented by the country 's tourism chief andreas andreadis in berlin on tuesday . 
  ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_04/03/2015_547860 ), 
  that is a terrible photoshop, 
  why do you think nato is massively building up their forces near you and baltics ? 
  they forsee this `` hybrid war '' spreading out and are preparing for it , so yes i think so . 
  estonian leader said it well in an article this week , since they have 300,000 russians in their country out of 1.5 million . 
  russian tractor drivers and coal miners in estonia ( which putin said were rebelling in east ukraine ) , were making 2,000 euros a month . 
  not even surgeons get paid that money in russia . 
  there is never going to be an uprising to join `` mother russia '' , when it comes down to it , money is the driving force behind many decisions . 
  well i agree with that , europe is a tightly packed region . 
  you are in nato and have 80 % of the worlds military spending protecting you . 
  the biggest mistake ukraine ever made was getting rid of their nuclear weapons when they were not in nato already . 
  i do n't agree that one side is good and one side is evil , all sides are equally evil and look for their own interests . 
  i do agree though that a multi-polar world is a very good thing , russia/china/iran balancing the power of a eu/usa world is good . 
  nothing good game from a monopoly of power , checks and balances are needed for equilibrium .

  better bosnia than isis, 
  that does n't make it better, 
  if you read the recent isis statement , they keep referring to france , germany and uk as `` the crusader countries '' . 
  if i had to guess it seems that isis indoctrination is heavily focused on revenge against these 3 countries specifically .
