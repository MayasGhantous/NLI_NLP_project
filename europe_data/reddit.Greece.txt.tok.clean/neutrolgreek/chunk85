  you would need a military assault rifle , body armor and other gear to fight a terrorist mid-attack , you would get killed being lightly armed . 
  wearing any of those would throw your cover , there is likely a weapons cache nearby to where each agent patrols , to get prepared for a potential street battle against multiple terrorists . 
  and month/year, 
  from 2004 interview http://www.spiegel.de/international/the-future-of-terrorism-what-al-qaida-really-wants-a-369448.html  the third phase this is described as `` arising and standing up '' and should last from 2007 to 2010 . 
  ** `` there will be a focus on syria , '' ** prophesies hussein , based on what his sources told him . 
  the fighting cadres are supposedly already prepared and some are in iraq . 
     the fourth phase between 2010 and 2013 , hussein writes that al-qaida will aim to bring about the collapse of the hated arabic governments . 
  the estimate is that `` the creeping loss of the regimes ' power will lead to a steady growth in strength within al-qaida . '', 
    the fifth phase this will be the point at which an ** islamic state ** , or caliphate , can be declared . 
  the plan is that by this time , between 2013 and 2016 , western influence in the islamic world will be so reduced and israel weakened so much , that resistance will not be feared . 
  al-qaida hopes that by then the islamic state will be able to bring about a new world order . 
    the sixth phase hussein believes that ** from 2016 onwards there will a period of `` total confrontation . 
  '' ** as soon as the caliphate has been declared the `` islamic army '' it will instigate the `` fight between the believers and the non-believers '' which has so often been predicted by osama bin laden . 
  religion of peace strikes again ? 
  mainly the aegean coast region of anatolia was populated by greeks , coastal cities have always been the main population centers for greeks . 
  the real reason is because there is currently a very ** very ** tight balance of power between france-uk-germany . 
  with turkey in the union it would completely change the power structure in the eu . 
  usa starting two illegal wars which single-handedly turned iraq into a jihadist utopia which then gave birth to isis , had absolutely nothing to do with it of course, 
  if it did happen , italy and greece would make a geo-political shift pretty quickly . 
  i am not sure if this is a horrible news or not , apparently this article states that the needs are 4 billion , but 14 billion is to maximize security for a `` worst case scenario '' , which is reasonable .

    the results of the stress tests were welcomed by top bankers in greece , who said that the relatively limited level of capital needs reflected the ability of local lenders to survive in difficult conditions . 
  it is only going to exponentially grow , that is the scariest part, 
  lol, 
  because the end goal is to colonize with muslim extremists , not re-build syria . 
  good guy turkish pm, 
  like you said , this is only for 2010-2014 and will likely target greek companies not individuals who purchased tens of millions of euros worth of property . 
  me too , maybe in next 1-2 years i hope, 
  it is not just big business they are going after , but systematic tax check-ups on small business across greece .

   funny how greece only goes after german companies for tax evading . 
  there are daily stories recently of major tax busts on greek businesses , the current government is not like the previous idiots which ignored this issue . 
  assuming that every greek person evaded taxes is why you people are so brainwashed , i guarantee that is what the average german thinks also which is funny . 
  the fact that greece has the largest air-force and tank force in europe mostly german/french military equipment played absolutely no role in the debt bubble . 
  low estimates of 300 billion to 600 billion spent on military over 30 years . 
  greece was scammed and used like a whore for decades , now it is time to find the right allies and alter geo-strategic needs . 
   yet the hard working , upstanding germans [ in terms of transforming a large primary deficit into a surplus , few countries have accomplished anything like what the greeks have achieved in the last five years . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/29/joseph-stiglitz-how-i-would-vote-in-the-greek-referendum )  and , though the cost in terms of human suffering has been extremely high , the greek government 's recent proposals went a long way toward meeting its creditors ' demands . 
    we should be clear : ** almost none of the huge amount of money loaned to greece has actually gone there ** . 
  it has gone to pay out private-sector creditors -- including german and french banks . 
  greece has gotten but a pittance , but it has paid a high price to preserve these countries ' banking systems . 
  the imf and the other `` official '' creditors do not need the money that is being demanded . 
  under a business-as-usual scenario , the money received would most likely just be lent out again to greece .

  the damage of ww2 can not be calculated in any amount , due to the fact that not only did it destroy greece in a 4 year span but it also caused the next 40 years of chaos , from the civil war to dictatorship , while germany was building amazing businesses , greece was stuck in a quasi-soviet state without the benefits of actually being allied with russia . 
  in the article it says that juncker said that quote . . so i am confused . 
  anyway , that was partly true in the time of all the elections and the crazy oxi vote which caused tensions , in that time there was very little of what you could consider a state . 
  that entire thing is bullshit , christianity did not come from judaism , unless you consider it a total rejection of it . 
  the only thing christians and jews share is a few chapters from genesis in the old testament , the new testament is a completely different religion with greko-roman mythology inter-mixed into the life story of jesus . 
  walking on water , resurrection after 3 days , water to wine were staples of greko-roman mythology . 
  islam teaching also have absolutely nothing to do with the new testament , i think the only thing in islam that relates to christianity is that muslims believe jesus was some kind of minor prophet . 
  he has like maybe one mention in the entire quran . 
  1,000 years `` not long '', 
  islam is not part of any branch with christianity . 
  italy is getting as many illegals as greece btw , both countries need a plan . 
  no need to be a smart ass , also if you wa n't to be technical about it , the greeks did not call it the eastern roman empire , it was `` new rome '' . 
  ever heard of byzantine ? 
  most people who use the term dark ages have never heard of it .

  you can just scroll through video quickly and there are more videos linked on right side of youtube, 
  when i said saints and angels i specifically implied that it was not just a modification but more as a connection between the two in the philosophical sense . 
  christianity is also not at all based on judaism , the new testament has literally nothing to do with the old , and in modern christianity the old testament plays almost no role other than the first few chapters explaining the origin story . 
  the new testament has many elements of greek mythology as many of the old gods stories were mixed in with the jesus story to better bring in new converts , a way to make the transition easier . 
  when i said christianity is pagan-lite , i am mean that they share many elements , not that christianity was a modification of actual paganism . 
  edit : also did you just say judaism predates paganism ? 
  wtf . 
  was i being edgy ? 
  it makes sense if you look at the origins of christianity, 
  christianity is basically pagan-lite if you want to get technical about it anyway . 
  the demi-gods and moral stories were just replaced with saints and angels who serve the same purpose . 
  `` integration '' they said `` multi-culturalism '' they said, 
  it 's ok , i forgive them, 
  estonia is one of the few countries i want to visit , the fact that it is less crowded and more personal experience is a huge factor . 
  that makes no sense . 
  because i put ( good news ) ? 
  this is the reason why everyone is leaving this subreddit, 
   12 pakistani nationals were arrested in association with the ring and allegedly had special labs where they forged the passports , as investigated by the greek police .

  there are ski resorts in northern greece that might be cheap , but not really sure . 
  thessaloniki is nice also if you want to avoid the cold . 
  cyprus would be very nice but the flight might be expensive but again not positive on that . 
  you can find very good deals for santorini also this time of year , it is a nice trip for a couple . 
  this is good news for greece/bulgaria/croatia / etc but bad news for italy/spain ( possibly ) . 
  the illegals migrants are determined to enter europe , and if the aegean/balkan route is shut down they will just go through the italy/spain route which is still wide open . 
  this plan has been in the works for at least 2-3 years but it looks to be a critical plan of action now due to crisis . 
  there was plans as far back as 2013/2014 to give visa-free travel to turkish citizens in return for protecting borders . 
  the turk-stream  greek-stream pipeline coming in next 2 years will be basically this . 
  edit : forgot the tanap ( turkey )  tap ( greece ) pipeline system , so theres actually two major pipeline networks being built between the two countries . 
  stream is from russia source and tanap/tap is from caspian sea/iran ( 2nd largest gas reserves ), 
  every single fsa group is dominated by islamists , some fsa groups are split between being more loyal to isis and others to al-nusra , that is the only difference between them . 
  they may not approve of beheading but they are certainly not democratic , their stated goal is to create a government based on islamic law . 
  the main difference between fsa and isis is that fsa would likely not genocide the alawites , shias and christians . 
  but that is a very big maybe .
