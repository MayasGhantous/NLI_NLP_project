  it was likely a package deal alongside ithaca monaco resort , 10 billion $ can make a lot of things happen, 
  a dubai prince just leased ( you ca n't buy only 10 year lease ) 12 non-inhabited islands near ithaca island part if ithaca is being turned into a luxury resort based off monaco . 
  the islands are being turned into rentable private luxury homes for wealthy people on vacation, 
  do you take credit card ?

  the rebels of e.ukraine with new backing from russia and apparently putin approval is making a massive offensive across all fronts . 
  the most capable military units of ukrainian army are either encircled or destroyed , leaving west ukraine vulnerable . 
  poroshenko needs to finally admit that this is not a `` ato '' and say the truth , this is war , and he needs to declare full mobilization of every single ukrainian on earth , otherwise far more than donetsk and luhansk will be lost soon, 
  uk/france/sweden will look like iraq in 20-30 years time , `` multi-cultural '' not only has failed , but has sowed the seeds for a future unavoidable war within these countries . 
  places like iraq and syria had `` multi-culturalism '' for decades with shia , sunni , christians living together but once the sunnis got majority population they went ape-shit and went to war with everyone else for dominance of the country . 
  the only thing holding back iraq from mayhem in the 80/90 's was a brutal dictator , once he was gone the mayhem began . 
  places like poland/greece with 90-95 % homogenous/same religion populations and refusal to accept `` multi-cult '' ideology have the best chance to avoid the iraq scenario sweden/uk/france is facing . 
  there are already signs of this upcoming struggle with hundreds of massive ghettos in france/uk/sweden being `` no-mans land '' for police/authorities and where islamic fundamentalists rule in their own fiefdoms . 
  what is need to survive the shit-storm of the future is not only the complete avoidance of multi-cultural ideology but the complete opposite with an intense grasp on traditional values and culture which places like greece and poland have in abundance . 
  countries were formed for a reason , it took tens of thousands of years to create uk/sweden/france and only 50 years to destroy them from within , there is no going back through peaceful methods and it is all downhill from here for them . 
  most people on this subreddit will consider what i say bullshit , beause of the intense programming they have received since childhood but the signs are already there and it will be getting far worse soon , not better , it will never get better for these countries , they are finished . 
  i am certain that by 2030-2050 poland will be the major power of the north alongside germany and greece/italy will be the major powers of the south , i do not see a bright future for many of the current powerful countries , mainly france/sweden/uk . 
  i am sure infrastructure started to be built from the 80 's , but from 1999 to today it seems to have gotten 100x better . 
  [ from the new athens airport voted `` best airport in 2014 '' by the airports council ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/06/19/athens-international-airport-best-in-europe/ ) to one of the best subways in europe in athens . 
  hundreds of new ferry/boat routes between islands/mainland . 
  dozens of new highways built in last decade , etc. 
  1999-2004 saw the biggest improvement due to the olympics but it still has gotten even better since then . 
  the debt came from spending 400 billion on military after the cyprus invasion , while most countries in europe have barely spent 20-40 billion $ in the last 30ish years on military , greece was forced to spend 400 billion due to a major foreign threat on its territory ( which is also why greece rushed into the eu unprepared ) greece has had its military spending cut and it is still one of only three countries in europe that meet the 2 % required nato spending threshold , ( poland has met the 2 % this year for first time making it the fourth in europe now * ) on the negative side greece went nearly bankrupt , positive side we have the most capable all-around military in europe with navy/army/air-force / special forces combination ( not for foreign/across seas invasions but purely defensive/within europe mainland ), 
  greek infrastructure now compared to 1999 is night and day . 
  greece has among the highest absorption rates of eu funds ( money used intelligently ) it is ok being aggressive , it is what you were trained to do considering your pensions statement, 
  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-29/polish-300-billion-aid-package-hides-eu-expansion-flaws.html 300 billion $ actually , thought it was 300 billion euros = 400 billion $ the money is not there to help the economy in any single way , only to bleed it dry as much as possible and `` hope '' for growth . 
  the worst is over for the `` pigs '' and growth is expected in 2015 in these countries ( except for spain i think ), 
  poland also received 400 billion from eu to make it `` strong '' larger than the combined bailouts of portugal , greece , spain , ireland, 
  one of the new escape rooms takes place in an old mental hospital and is called `` insanity '' and the other new escape room is based of csi tv series . 
   five players are locked into a room and try to gather information , objects , keys , codes , puzzles , combine them to solve the riddle and escape within one hour . 
  the players must collaborate and use their creativity and imagination to solve the case and escape the room . 
    the first greek escape room opened in athens and is called `` athensclue '' . 
  a few months ago , it was number one on tripadvisor 's list of the top athens attractions . 
  it is currently in second place over the acropolis museum ( 3rd ) and the temple of hephaestus ( 4th ) . 
  `` adventure rooms , '' a similar establishment with multiple escape rooms , has topped the tripadvisor 's list . 
  the flag seems to crowded in the middle , if instead of a blue background the entire flag was just the center piece expanded , i would actually like that make the flags easier to see and not have it jammed in a small space in the middle, 
  yeh , also hard to take serious when they do n't give sample size . 
  they could have just questioned a single person and now they represent all 12 + million greeks, 
  he said it again in public yesterday, 
  the greeks/serbs fighting are locals of east ukraine who joined up with local militias , most likely the `` orthodox militia '' which i have heard about recently . 
  going to prison will help him recruit much easier . 
  they get to spend the next 5 years in prison preaching jihadism and salvation to a bunch of vulnerable people . 
  uk has a massive problem with islamic conversion in prison for example, 
  i would go with byzantine double head eagle for the 100 draxma ( which i assume is the largest amount ? ), 
  rodos castle city for 50 draxma new acropolis museum for 20 draxma ww2 greek resistance 10 draxma would be nice also, 
   according to the newspaper , there is a large community of greeks in the east of ukraine , who have suffered as much as other residents of the region and many of them fled for russia 's rostov and kuban regions . 
  no other country in europe even spent a fraction of % of gdp during the last 30 years . 
  most countries today do not even spend the required 2 % required to be in nato . 
  only uk , greece and france in europe do . 
  and greece is spending 2 % even after the crisis , so that is a major reduced amount to previous 5-10 % of gdp since cyprus invasion . 
  greek total debt is 350 billion $ and military spending since cyprus invasion was around 350-400 billion $ , most countries of must larger size in europe especially in northern europe have not even spent 20-40 billion in that same time period . 
  military budget went astronomical after cyprus invasion and has only calmed down post-2008 to the standard 2 % ( which still only 3 countries in europe accomplish ), 
  how did you take that context of my comment ? 
  lagarde is a piece of shit , so were greek politicians pre-2008 . 
  which is why the entire political party that ruled greece from 1980-2008 completely disintegrated . 
  that would be like the democrat party of usa disintegrating . 
  it was a pretty big deal here and still is . 
  equally amoral and corrupt , its like comparing ebola to bubonic plague, 
  tax evasion amounted to less than 10-15 % of total debt that got out of control , a large amount but not the defining factor of the crisis . 
  the reason greece went bankrupt was spending over 300-400 billion $ on military since the cyprus invasion . 
  while most countries in europe had the benefit of having no external threats after ww2 and barely spent more than 20-40 billion in the last 30 years . 
  greece had to go all out and spend 300-400 billion to protect itself . 
  that makes no sense nor is it what she implied . 
  the statement was made to seem that the greek suffering is not as bad as africa , which is understandable but it is still a stupid thing to say when people are homeless/poverty in athens due to policies she backed ( which were mostly errors ), 
  both pipelines will be built across the entire country , tap across the entire north of greece and emp across southern greece from crete all the way to the north . 
  you do n't let two pipelines be built across the entire country and not control it . 
  the pipelines will be mostly used to sell azerbaijani and israel/cyprus gas for the most part and profits will be split , but as greece drills its own gas ( potential of 20 trillion $ ) than that will be added also to the pipelines . 
  greece is also building the igb pipeline to supply the balkans with primarily greek natural gas, 
  tap pipeline connects azerbaijan gas fields to greece , greece will then sell that gas to eu emp pipeline connects levithian basin of israel/cyprus to greece who will ship it to the eu both will be complete in 2020 + greece is also drilling for gas in aegean/ionian sea 's . 
  eu needs a short term solution until 2020 , but after that we will be ok, 
  random joke i was going to edit my post , but i will just reply here lagarde was not hated by greeks because she said `` hey pay taxes !, 
  '' ( no shit ? ), 
  she was hated because she is quoted as saying [ `` the international monetary fund has ratcheted up the pressure on crisis-hit greece after its managing director , christine lagarde , said she has more sympathy for children deprived of decent schooling in sub-saharan africa than for many of those facing poverty in athens . 
  '' ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/25/payback-time-lagarde-greeks ) this provked anger because many people at the time and still are struggling with poverty due to austerity and this made it seem like she could not care less about their suffering , part of which she was to blame for as the imf has admitted to making critical errors which worsened the greek recovery for no other reason than imf incompetency, 
  absolutely haram, 
  at least you got all that nazi gold, 
  `` lebanon has world ending immigration '' should europe also be destroyed before we can do something ? 
  greece will , if rest of europe wants them you are welcome to have them, 
  they can be flown back to the countries they illegally entered the eu from, 
  it is harsh but italy can do what the greek government is currently doing all illegals are placed into camps ( no not that type of camp ) , and forced to stay until they accept being flown back home . 
  only extreme cases are allowed refugee status ( like it should be ) i read recently that over 10-20 ,000 illegals in greece agreed to be flown back home by the greek government . 
  also any captured human trafficker should receive a 30-50 year prison sentence . 
  [ nikos dendias , the minister of public order and citizen protection , speaking at an event organized by the rotary club of athens , on tuesday , stated that the ministry is taking several measures to prevent illegal immigration and criminality in greece . 
  the minister claimed that more than 100,000 illegal immigrants will be sent back to their countries and that greek borders will be shielded with electronic monitoring tools .

  link is from official ukraine government map just updated - it looks like there is a massive offensive taking place across the entire southern ukraine border .

  we 'll greece was ready to exit the eu and then our pm was removed by merkel and bailout program happened . 
  in the end greece will prevail, 
  short term no long term yes, 
  then why do germans act like they gave greece truck loads of cash for the `` bailout '' when none of that `` bailout '' money never left germany and went straight to german banks ? 
  oh and the bailout is already profitable also for germany , so you can not go with the `` charity '' argument , since it was pure usury leve loan . 
  they did send back a tiny bit of it and it ended up being inferior quality 98 % pure shit gold and not the 99.99 % pure german gold forged with the german eagle crest stamp . 
  my point with sparta/philip is that philip learned battle tactics and strategy during his time leading the thebans into battle against the spartans . 
  he used this knowledge to train his personal army in makedon which alexander inherited , and yes by the time alexander started marching , sparta was only a shadow of its old self . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/achaean_league i am referring to the second aechean league formed after alexander 's death , an alliance of greek city-states . 
  also how can you boldly claim `` only royalty were considered greek , not villagers '' .
