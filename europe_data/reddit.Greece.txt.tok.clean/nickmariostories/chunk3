  do i see a greek opressed minority ? 
  ok go live in somalia since you love anarchism so much . 
  sad , he destroyed a fucking plane !, 
  are you for real ? 
  name a country which was benefited from anarchism . 
  asking for a frined who is researching about croatian politics . 
  to think that in greece we have currently mini torpadoes . 
  they were far left anarchists though, 
  yes i think its the 7th largest or something like that, 
  trigerred ? 
  there are some people who speak aromanian not publicly but in private . 
  i even know a couple . 
  the live mostly in thessaly in the region close to larissa and in villages in western macedonia . 
  there are not a lot and it is nice that a more unkwmon language is included . 
  it was made by greek immigrants from the island of anafi with the same architecutral style as in the island . 
  i thought would be highere on fish consumption ... 
  only 2 turkish players ... 
  r/greece is a relative active sub with many political and touristy material . 
  also almost all the jokes are inside jokes and its full with circklejerk . 
  there are also some users who are posting all the time memes, 
  hahaha r/greece is a huge circlejerk, 
  every european govermnent has a central bureau of statistics . 
  greece for example has also . 
  but does this research include them ? 
  erdogan clealry doesnt care whether they join or not anymore . 
  tbh porn is cancerous, 
  soon, 
  thats why you go to greece and not to turkey, 
  i thought it is free for students ? 
  moldova third . 
  nor bad . 
  croatia moldova romania, 
  where do the umpa lumpas reside ? 
  the only french edition was relased too early and so they added some english verses to make the song applicable for the contest . 
  yes the song was good, 
  alexander the great . 
  very proud of him . 
  protip go to greece instead, 
  anatolia cyprus constantinople pontus fyrom northern epirus southern italy sicily southern bulgaria crimea southern france corsica sardinia northern egypt northern libya malta palestine phoenicia eastern spain valearic islands the adriatic cost will be byzantine again, 
  why should we get punished ? 
  we have thousand migrants and they would want also to sanction us ? 
  crete becomes independent with no debt . 
  it annexes the rest of the country with no debt . 
  situation fixed !, 
  so you are not swedish ? 
  we dont dance in the beaches , greece has very tall mountains and it is very mountainous . 
  we dont have only white buildings and there are not ancient monuments everywhere you go ( thought that may be somewht true ) . 
  in greece it is quite common , especially in tavernas/restaurants or in deliveries , especially if the delivery boy has endured bad conditions . 
  we usually tip 1euro for tavernas and we round up for delivery boys . 
   in reality their viewpoints are reasonably rare . 
  no they are not especially were i am from, 
  some linguistic differences , notable climate changes , they are more balkan like in the north we in the south are more mediteranean . 
  different music , dances and even cuisine . 
  no it is extremely weird . 
  both deserve equally harsh punishment . 
  since i am against the death penalty like many here , they deserved isolation in prison or something like that . 
  though whatever the punishment would have been it still wouldnt have reversed the crimes and the pain both of them created . 
  in greece you would be new democracy one of the most corrupt parties just like hillary . 
  being next to turkey, 
  to reclaim anatolia constantinople and most of the byzantine empire of course !, 
  thats why you are how you are, 
  we use those constantly, 
  hated, 
  mostly farmers, 
  have you been to greece ? 
  what about stalin ? 
  he killed more people !, 
  cyprus , since we speak the same language , the netherlands , ireland , norway , switzerland , san marino . 
  yes, 
  they exist fyrom, 
  that there are ancient temples at every corner and that greece has only beaches with old guys who teach sirtaki . 
  also its always sunny and no one works here ever . 
  it personally really annoys me . 
  greeks of all ages tend to stay at the cafeterias for hours upon hours doing nothing but wasting their time . 
  if they dont have the time to stay at the caf\u00e8s they call the coffee shops and they have the coffees delivered !, 
  so you always see a greek in a coffee shop or a greek with coffee in his hands ( ice coffee not hot called frape ) . 
  father 51 mother 41, 
  i was confused with a spaniard in multiple occasions when i was abroad and speaking greek, 
  british english since most of the english teachers are brit weaboos, 
  the selfisness , the caf\u00e8 culture , the lazy bangamon players , the politics in the universities , garbage,

  we have the largest commercial navy in the world, 
  lol its the truth not flamebait, 
  dont you have the bulgarians preserving your language ? 
  no other language, 
  many times when i am abroad in other european countries with my friends speaking greek , we are mistaken with spanish because the languages i guess seem similar to a foreign ear . 
  some belgian girls thought we were spanish and greeted us with `` buenos dias '' etc and when we told them that we are greeks they lost interest ... :(, 
  is there a phrase describing this attitude ? 
  in greece its exactly the same, 
  the same in greece, 
  but you can apply also in greece ? 
  yeah it is too much of a hassle for a below average product . 
  do you have panellinies there too ? 
  tbh greek girls are shit tier compared to serbian girls . 
  btw since i live in the deep south do serbs come to greece ? 
  ( in the south there are not many people from the balkans ), 
  kathimerini , the new york times of greece, 
  no in university it changes . 
  actually it is same with elementary school . 
  how did you like thesaloniki ?
