  just like french are more suitable to defend france and so on and so forth . 
  let 's just say i do not trust anyone else than greeks to defend greece .

  no , they have nothing to do with macedonia . 
  it is stupid that we should call them that because `` they are not going to give up the macedonian label easily '' . 
  i honestly do not give a single flying fuck about that , if you repeat a lie enough it does not make it the truth .

  it does not compute . 
  no , fuck that . 
  i am not going to be called a slav when i say that i am from western macedonia . 
  i am a greek .
