  liberal populism is okay , it 's the leftist populism which gives / r/europe a collective aneurysm . 
  oh okay , so we should have voted for the journalist-turned-political-opportunist whose politics are a carbon copy of the aforementioned , if they are defined at all ? 
  or greece 's very own version of ukip ? 
  or the kke or golden dawn ? 
  who * should * we have elected in your opinion ? 
  yeah we should have voted for samaras or venizelos , right ? 
  or papandreou again . 
  * that * would have been the solution .

  wow , you managed to make the overwhelming majority of economists , citing basic macroeconomics 101 theory ( is-lm ) , sound absolutely nuts . 
  the liberal extremism of this subreddit is just absurd sometimes . 
  no wonder / r/europe managed to drive every russian poster from the subreddit . 
  they hated him because he was a leftist who would n't fold to the whims of capital and liberalism , and he needed to be punished lest the left gain momentum in europe . 
  oh you mean the report the european commission tried to block the imf from releasing because it called austerity a second-best solution and believed the current requested debt relief was needed as early as 2011 , destroying any credibility the troika had in continuing with their austerity policies ? 
  the liberal position might lose , that 's what is wrong with it . 
  democracy is wonderful and grand , only if you vote for liberals and social democrats from now until the end of time . 
  her economic policies are :p, 
  and austerity started in 2008 , so i do n't see what 's so invalid about the source . 
  it 's not like their position has changed since then .

  do you even is-lm , bro ? 
  there is absolutely a consensus against austerity in the economic discipline , only austrian nutcases advocate it . 
  even the imf has called it an abject failure . 
  its the extremist liberal politicians who choose to ignore them . 
   the word does not mean anything formally oh okay . 
  `` stop the german hate , you lazy parasitic hostage-taking greeks ! '', 
  -- german media for the last 7 years, 
  seriously , you guys have told us how to run our country for seven years , handpicked a prime minister for us , and after that told us how to vote in four consecutive elections . 
  the fucking arrogance . 
  anti-austerity positions are absolutely the consensus among economists , whereas the opposite is true for politicians . 
  even the fucking imf admitted austerity has been an abject failure in europe . 
  the uk had quote expansionary monetary policy to complement their austerity , the eurozone has had contractionary policy . 
  it 's not the same at all . 
  you can compare the situation in europe to a hypothetical situation in which the liberal and conservative parties of canada cooperate to keep the ndp from ever winning an election . 
  except now the ndp is getting popular , so the other parties supporters are getting pissed off . 
  i do n't think this is attributable to any material change to the sub . 
  i must think its the same extremist centrism that has always been on display , except now there are very real threats to their monopoly on policymaking at the european level , and the centrists are throwing a fit . 
  its as if they believe the only people who should ever govern anything are liberals and social democrats . 
  oh okay , i forgot we lived in a europe where treaties and laws are not enforced anymore . 
  thanks for reminding me . 
  it will just `` happen . '', 
   `` referendums should decide fundamental constitutional issues , not immediate economic tactics , however momentous '' nevermind that the constitution itself says that a referendum can be called at any time on an issue during a national crisis . 
  is this some new kind of football where the goalposts move wherever the players want them to ? 
  i personally think they 're great, 
  and at one point the prime minister of greece was not elected either . 
   kicked out of europe . 
  it 's been 7 years and still no one has found out what mechanism there is for getting kicked out of europe . 
  those are the only choices . 
  there is no alternative . 
  austerity or out of the euro . 
  nice try , samaras . 
  no sane economist advocates austerity in a recession . 
  there were several profitable state run firms sold off too , like the most profitable lottery in all of europe . 
   without common policy pretty sure germany wants all the debtor countries to privatise , cut and export . 
  perhaps germany should leave the euro if it is so unhappy behaving like they 're in an economic union, 
  he was very competent . 
  he broke away from his own party after throwing a fit to start his own , then went * back * to his old party and rose all the way to the top . 
  a very competent power-grabber . 
  good riddance . 
  he is the epitome of greek corruption and power-hunger . 
  no u, 
  i do n't think you read my comment , your response has nothing to do with it at all . 
   if you ca n't handle your budget the imf and ecb have effectively been handling greece 's budget for the last 7 years and have brought on even economic outcomes than the original recession . 
  liberals across europe love democracy , until their monopoly on it is called iinto question . 
  new democracy was being accused of fixing opinion polls , after internal party documents were leaked saying they would try to do just that ( not sure if the leak was verified ) . 
  registered = eligible votes counted reporting = % of eligible votes counted voted = turnout, 
  umad , yes supporters ? 
  thing is many were arguing that opinion polls were leaning in favor of yes , because of internal new democracy party documents leaked which basically said they were trying to fix the polls . 
  from your own damn article  as the imf recommended , imports were reduced and exports were increased . 
  the effect of the cuts in imports in romania , a net importer of food from the west , was however not correctly estimated by the foreign analysts and it led to food shortages . 
  and its easy to get out of a crisis when you have a world superpower on your doorstep to export everything you own to . 
  greece does not have that and will never have that . 
  so what , there is only one policy for all economic climates ? 
  economy doing great ? 
  time to cut spending !, 
  economy doing bad ? 
  time to cut spending !, 
  the overwhelming majority of economists think austerity is the absolute worst thing to do in a recession , it has a history of failing nearly everywhere it has been tried , and that stimulus spending and expansionary monetary policy is proven to be effective . 
  the ones that do n't are loony pseudoscientific austrians that no one in the discipline pays attention to . 
  yet the political mainstream in europe sided with them for the last 7 years . 
  then his comment is irrelevant to the discussion . 
  the change they want to see has only made the problem worse for 7 years . 
  austerity is the reason this problem has not been solved yet . 
   austerity or leave the eurozone these are the only choices , there is no alternative / s, 
  if you believe that either of this things were implemented in greece as a response to the recession , at any point at all , then you 're deluded beyond belief and there is no reason continuing discussion with you . 
   without raising taxes or cutting services , which was always going to be impossible expansionary monetary policy and stimulus spending is actually the most successful policy mix that countries ' have at their disposal . 
  there 's nothing responsible about austerity in a recession . 
  it has such a horrible track record , that economists promoting it might as well be accused of pseudoscience . 
  liberals and social democrats need to cement their monopoly on policymaking until the end of time , or they will never be happy . 
  i think its that plus `` i ca n't let leftists have any sort of momentum in europe . '', 
  he chose the culture which northern europeans believe is inferior to theirs . 
  dank memes must be cut by 35 % , circlejerks by 10 % and a new brigade tax must be imposed . 
   european leaders can not bend to the will of an extremist party . 
  they are being extremist liberals . 
  sorry , you do n't get to have monopoly on policymaking forever . 
  there is no such thing as a free market . 
  it 's an unreachable fantasyland . 
  and calling a culture `` lazy '' is not science in any way whatsoever . 
   making the necessary reforms first the list of `` necessary reforms '' never ends , and neither do the horrifying results of them .
