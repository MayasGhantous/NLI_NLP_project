   the moment we decide to turn people into citizen militia and make them defend themselves is the moment we give up on our law enforcement and risk allowing crime to skyrocket . 
  no one is * making * them defend themselves - just giving them the option . 
  the police will still be there . 
  but what happens when someone is committing a crime ? 
  the police rarely get there to catch the person in the act - they get there afterwards . 
  would you rather be facing off against a couple afghanis who just kicked in your door with just a stick ( which will probably get your arrested for violent conduct in greece anyway ) while waiting for the police or be able to defend yourself in a meaningful way ? 
   more guns and lax gun laws = / = more safety . 
  it 's quite the opposite . 
  is it ? 
  is your example going to be the us - where drug violence is through the roof in a level that 's just incomprehensible in europe ? 
  i live in one of the worse cities in the us , and i own a gun . 
  i 'm happy i do . 
  i 'm happy i can use it to defend myself . 
  when family from greece visits i take them to the bad parts of my city so they can see what the situation really is - and they all come away depressed . 
  it 's not a matter of a bunch of well-to-do students shooting up schools , it 's a bunch of drug violence between young teens who buy illegal guns and shoot each other over who owns which corner . 
  when you see 10 year old kids selling drugs on the corner before noon on a school day the picture starts to paint itself . 
  society , culture , and the oppressive drug war has created this culture of violence , not guns themselves . 
  guns are just tools . 
  and guns are less deadly than other tools like automobiles , in absolutely every country except for those at war , but we never call for banning automobiles . 
  that 's the damn truth , and people seem to misunderstand that . 
  they 're looking at the symptom , and not the cause . 
  they see gun deaths and think there 's a school shooting every day , which is definitely not the case . 
  even the most cursory glance at the statistics shows that gun violence is generally carried out by people that would n't be going to their local gun shops to buy guns legally ... 
  what are the reasons i listed out that it 's a bad idea ? 
  you 're telling me that only people smuggling guns into greece illegally should have them ? 
  that people breaking into your home is a reason not to own a gun ? 
  big deal ? 
  this is ~ 35 rounds of 9mm / .380 , ~ 15 rounds of .22 , a flock 19 with suppressor , some cheap .380 , and a .22 rifle . 
  the only thing you can terrorize with this is the local rabbit population . 
  i would think we should be more open to guns now with the way things have gone . 
  migrants breaking into and looting homes , police always too far away or too lazy , and gun and drug smugglers through evros and traveling through northern greece . 
  we should be able to protect ourselves without have to rely on `` run away and hope they do n't follow . '', 
  you can get an ak47 for $ 50 outside kastoria . 
  you can buy all the ammunition and magazines you want . 
  you can even buy suppressors . 
  do n't me the stuff in the op is what scares you . 
  it 's way too easy to buy actually scary rifles in greece . 
  what 's rhetoric to you is truth the me , and vice versa . 
  millions of people are n't dying . 
  most of the people flooding into europe are n't from countries totally engulfed in war . 
  we should n't be responsible for making the lives of nigerians , kenyans , liberians , afghanis , pakistanis , bangalis , azerbaijanis , kazakhs , libyans , algerians , etc better by letting them live in europe . 
  we can help those countries get better but those people should n't be coming to live in europe unless we absolutely need them . 
  like i said , our people have enough problems that we should deal with first . 
  we should n't be allowing millions of others * not fleeing war * in for no reason . 
  ca n't be , not enough heineken and eagle pictures . 
   in the age of icbms , control crete and you control the eastern mediterranean . 
  the us probably wants their base in crete back and honestly it might be a good idea to give it to them . 
  better the us in greece than in turkey . 
   a few cities and islands in greece remain disputed according to many turks . 
  the western coast of turkey and eastern thrace remain disputed according to some greeks . 
  that 's just how things work when you 've had a hostile relationship for a thousand years . 
  geography . 
  the us and russia are too far away to be impacted . 
  i am one of those you reference - started off as eurosceptic , became anti-eu since the start of the crisis and the eu 's terms , my anti-eu feelings deepened with merkel 's `` refuges welcome '' and the migrant crisis , but now i 've come to realize there really is not other option . 
  either we unify with europe proper and bring eastern europe into the eu , all the while strengthening the union , or we watch erdogan , putin , and the like divide us to conquer . 
  what i would like to see is europe take their world leader role more seriously and put an end to things like the crisis in ukraine , unify cyprus , bring eastern europe and the baltics into the union , and then work on improving external entities . 
  should work on fixing and unifying europe proper before we worry about taking in the world 's migrants . 
  nothing wrong with helping people from afghanistan , bangladesh , nigeria , or libya but we should be focusing on helping eastern europe , greece , and resolving the ukraine question first and foremost . 
  there are many people from those countries who need eu help , and they are eu ... 
  the byzantines held land in north africa , the levant , anatolia , italy , spain , and much of the balkans . 
  they were influential in that part of the world and a huge reason why half of europe is n't muslim today . 
  they 're pretty important for europe and should be taught along with their western roman ancestors . 
   used to taking people down . 
  you know wwe is fake , right ? 
  what bush did does not absolve obama of his failures . 
  you 're right - it does n't . 
  see my comment [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5x9brb/how_to_say_european_countries_name_in/degq7ht/ ), 
  i was wrong - i confused the old term with the new chinese term : `` although the contemporary chinese term for greece ( \u5e0c\u81d8 x\u012bl\u00e0 ) is based on hellas , chinese previously used what was likely a version of the yunan or yona root when referring to the d\u00e0yu\u0101n ( \u5927\u5b9b ) . 
  the d\u00e0yu\u0101n were probably the descendants of the greek colonies that were established by alexander the great and prospered within the hellenistic realm of the seleucids and greco-bactrians , until they were isolated by the migrations of the yueh-chih around 160 bc . 
  it has been suggested that the name yuan was simply a transliteration of the words yunan , yona , or ionians , so that d\u00e0yu\u0101n ( literally `` great yuan '' ) would mean `` great yunans '' or `` great ionians . '' '', 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/names_of_the_greeks#yunani_.28.e1.bc.bc.cf.89.ce.bd.ce.b5.cf.82.29.2c_and_yavan_.28.d7.99.d6.b8.d7.95.d6.b8.d7.9f.29 ), 
  it 's not a direct she like `` shh '' or the english word she ( which is pronounce `` shhh-ee '' ) . 
  that would be the pinyin `` sh . '', 
  it 's halfway between s and sh , and it 's actually damn close to the greek sigma . 
  it does n't sound like she-la , either . 
  see-la is the best way i can translate the pinyin over to easily-digestible english . 
  i got pleeeenty of practice saying the word when i lived in china . 
  people kept asking me where i was from and i had to keep repeating it !, 
  greece in mandarin is pronounced like `` see-la '' the root of that is different from korean and japanese . 
  korean and japanese get their word for greece from western languages ( hence using the western term for greece ) while china uses the greek `` hellas '' as the root . 
  in chinese the name for greece used to be dayuan , using `` ionian '' as the root , like the middle east and central/south asia . 
  edit : corrected information on root of xila . 
  see my comment [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5x9brb/how_to_say_european_countries_name_in/degq7ht/ ), 
   was n't the eu letting greece help itself ? 
  it sounds like you 're advocating for eu member states send agents into greece to work on agriculture and infrastructure . 
  not that i saw , and you 're welcome to prove that 's the case but from what we 've all seen the eu told greece they could get a bail out if greece agreed to austerity measures . 
  that was the deal . 
  that was the first , second , and third bailout deals and if there are any more it 'll surely be the same story . 
  i 'm advocating the eu send agents to greece to help greek business improve to help improve the economy as a whole . 
  that 's one way to pay off debt - improve the economy . 
  the other is to cut spending . 
  the eu has advocated a serious cut in all spending while increasing revenues through increasing taxes ( rather than improving the economy , getting money flowing further and faster , which would still increase tax revenue but in a beneficial way ) . 
   the eu is many things to many people , but i always thought member states were responsible for upholding their end of the bargain . 
  they are . 
  if they can . 
  that 's where the eu needs to decide what kind of union it is - does it expect member states to uphold their end of the bargain and impose punitive measures on those that do n't , or does it constructively help those countries that are having issues to help bring up the union as a whole and unify it further ? 
   can you elaborate on the part about leasing infrastructure ? 
  i do n't know anything about that .
