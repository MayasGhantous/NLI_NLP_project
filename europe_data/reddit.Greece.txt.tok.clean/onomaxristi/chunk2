  ok , if nato or un could take the asia minor coastline for greece , we could happily build 2 or 3 walls !, 
  think about the possibilities !, 
  yeah , if it is remotely operated it 's nowhere close to undetectable ... 
  thermal imaging in a non-braking zone could easily reveal any kind of current in the 60w ballpark . 
  [ look at this thermal blanket ] ( https://www.google.gr/imgres?imgurl=http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0750/6693/files/electric_blanket_flir_grande.png%253f2320&amp;imgrefurl=http://bedjet.com/pages/dual-zone-temperature&amp;h=260&amp;w=600&amp;tbnid=ji72llbf8z_cqm:&amp;docid=uv5ogf_c56fipm&amp;ei=fbawvqqliyyqsah2hqjwba&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=0ahukewjqg4mzntnkahumfswkhxydck4qmwgekaewaq ) . 
  this should be a double 80w circuit . 
  you just need someone to blame ... 
  if it makes you feel better , that 's ok with me . 
  and then finland , italy , and croatia and eventually hungary ? 
  you talk like you live in germany or the uk ... 
  you 're really not supposed to drink the ouzo like that ... 
  testing started in trikala greece ~ ~ last year ~ ~ 2014 , i believe both are under the same programm . 
  land route is fenced . 
  in greece the `` pre-kindergarten '' place is called \u03a0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u03a3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b8\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 - kid 's station .

  greek and turkish army leaders think they live in the 1800 's . 
  somebody needs to strip the boys from their expensive war toys . 
  hospitals in greece do n't have money for gloves amd bandages , and we spend on jet fuel ...

  i do n't know . 
  economical and short term it was a disaster ... 
  most low and middle class people in greece where pro syriza up until march-may but turned against them again when they realized the true consequences . 
  but then syriza changed and we now have another government doing what it 's predecessors did . 
  and i am sure nobody voted for that !, 
  our kind of communists and portuguese communists are not like the `` filthy '' romanian communists . 
  and i wrote germany and co for a reason ... 
  i do n't believe they intervened , it 's just some portuguese being afraid of what happened to greece , and ** not allowing ** similar political actions in portugal . 
  i 'm no political analyst , mind you . 
  wtf is this ? 
  why do n't we let germany and co assign the governments in all of europe , to get it over with ? 
  voting does nothing anyways ... 
  they had a fight for line positions, 
  you know ... 
  typical lazy germans . 
  all the know is complaining about the rainy weather , and proceed to fill every available lot and rooftop with solar panels . 
  i believe this is now the sole reason you do n't see athens up in flames in riots for 25 % unemployment or 65 % tax rate and 24 % vat . 
  people have realized that they or their parents voted for what we have today . 
  being angry at your past choices does n't change anything ... 
  yeah , wrong answer ... his overreacting is due to what he was promised , he did n't book in 1980 's cambodia for his vacations ... for example , in greece the police try to turn beggars and illegal shops away from touristy areas specifically for them not bugging tourists . 
  freaking islamists, 
  the tax on coffee just went up 5 % along with beer and wine . 
  so , there goes that ... 
  modern greek is full of turkish words , here is a [ list ] ( http://www.iefimerida.gr/news/114550/%ce%bf%ce%b9-200-%cf%84%ce%bf%cf%8d%cf%81%ce%ba%ce%b9%ce%ba%ce%b5%cf%82-%ce%bb%ce%ad%ce%be%ce%b5%ce%b9%cf%82-%cf%80%ce%bf%cf%85-%cf%87%cf%81%ce%b7%cf%83%ce%b9%ce%bc%ce%bf%cf%80%ce%bf%ce%b9%ce%bf%cf%8d%ce%bc%ce%b5-%ce%ba%ce%b1%ce%b8%ce%b7%ce%bc%ce%b5%cf%81%ce%b9%ce%bd%ce%ac-%ce%ba%ce%b1%ce%b9-%ce%b4%ce%b5%ce%bd-%cf%84%ce%bf-%ce%be%ce%ad%cf%81%ce%bf%cf%85%ce%bc%ce%b5-%ce%bb%ce%af%cf%83%cf%84%ce%b1 ) i just googled . 
  also [ vice versa ] ( http://users.otenet.gr/~aker/lekseise-k.htm ) greek words in turkey ( is it accurate ? ), 
  nah , just messing with you, 
  lol , you are worst than us ... 
  check before you speak , rusky pleb ... 
  i think we just smudge the numbers to pay less import tax ... 
  why the hell are we spending 5bn per year when we spiral downwards ? 
  this is stupider than stupid ... 
  think of it this way : your country ( and mine ) also did have their time in the past , have already used up whatever was precious at the time , and are now in the decline . 
  it 's just luck . 
  greeks fucked up royally and europe came to our rescue . 
  i thank you for all the help . 
  but it has come to a point where german and duch elections dictate my salary for the next few months . 
  i bet you stopped hearing about greece in your tv news but over here things go from bad to worse . 
  i am ashamed to say this but you should really think of greece as your investment . 
  if the loaners do n't give us some breathing room the loans will never be paid . 
  i did read your comment , and thought it implied what i asked you about . 
  also telling me that my and my clildrens lives will be screwed because germany can not reach an agreement with the imf is not an option for me . 
  sorry , it just is n't . 
  so you believe that the minimum wage earners in greece are responsible for the economical crisis of 2008 , and they must pay now ? 
  they are not government , yet !, 
  all the tinfoil hat theories are irritating . 
  but when they are adopted buy members of a government things get more serious ... 
  do you have any information on the matter whatsoever ? 
  i think it 's because their right wing or nationalist narrative can be very irritating ... 
  greece too , half the people go to church once a year tops , and the official number is something like 95 % orthodox . 
  lol , take your reasoning out of here ... / s serous question , who is this mp , is he half crazy or something ? 
  cheapest is ~ 7 $ in greece , average is 10 $, 
  * cough * ... 
  the temple of hephaestus is the best preserved in greece, 
  did you answer to someone else ? 
  are there any living people left in constantinople ? 
  or did the last bombings kill everybody ? 
  but that money is guaranteed by the eu whereas db was left on it 's own ... edit : after the first mou, 
  \u0397\u03b3\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 is the verb meaning `` to lead '' so \u03b7\u03b3\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 - \u03b7\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7 - \u03b7\u03b3\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf literaly means `` the one who leads or is ahead '' . 
  it is used in religious rankings for the one who is in charge of a monastery . 
  neither do i !, 
  fuck off , will ya ? 
  can confirm, 
  you could be the pope , i would still argue that the sound is similar . 
  go ask your dad . 
  i can only assume you do n't know how the y in yeast is pronounced . 
  it 's like `` yeast '', 
  lol , no one ever talks about it ? 
  it is literally common knowledge , only stalinists try to bent this part of history . 
  i want to visit cork someday !, 
  hope it makes you feel better . 
  in greece we make spaceships and re-brand them as [ churches ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=agioi+anargyroi+maroussi&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewigp6jmxnjtahvbvrokhd8xddaq_auicygc&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=633#imgrc=opuflw5ipnv0wm: ) . 
  meh , slovakia , slovenia , slovorkia , all are the same ... communists with euro-capitalist pockets ... edit : / s , for the newcomers ... 
  true , how did n't i think of it sooner ... 
  wth , they are talking about cutting everything once again , unemployment benefits were 350 $ for 9 months only if you were working for 2 full years prior to being fired and once every 4 years , how can you lower this ? 
  here we go then . 
  i rest my case !, 
  if you really want to debate , and not just trolling , your claim hides the exact reason a rational greek ( not the right wing screams ) is skeptic of the name macedonia . 
  we already have a clearly defined group of people called macedonians . 
  we have three out of thirteen regions named west , central and east macedonia . 
  northern greeks are proud to declare themselves as macedonians and make fun of the southerners for pronouncing words wrong and ordering souvlaki the wrong way . 
  what do you want out of this ?
