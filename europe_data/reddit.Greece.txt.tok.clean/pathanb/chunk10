  reporter : the guys ... new man : we are taking them to try to save some . 
  give me ( half ) a minute . 
  * reporter walks outside again * ** scene starting at 5:00 ** reporter : all this happens in an area where there is a gas station here ... 
  girl : ... the last one was driven away with kicks , i 'm telling yout the truth , you must n't go near , reporters do n't do well with us ... whatever shots you need [ indistinct ] young man : they have already driven away many , that 's why ... reporter : who ? 
  who ? 
  i do n't understand . 
  young man : erm , the guys here , they drive away reporters , we saw one also get attacked ... people in the distance : `` matthew ! '', 
  - `` not the black , you should be visible ! '', 
  [ video cut to same place ] crowd : `` get over here ! '', 
  `` guys , make way ! '', 
  [ indistinct ] [ two men seemingly leading a third one against his will , occasionally hitting him ] reporter : guys !, 
  man from crowd : let him have iiiit !, 
  crowd : [ indistinct ] reporter : guys , who is he ? 
  [ ... ] who is he ? 
  [ ... ] who is he ? 
  who was he ? 
  unseen man # 2 : [ indistinct ] unseen man # 3 : sounding close , probably talking to the reporter ) you know what to do tomorrow , right ? 
  you know tomorrow , right ? 
  golden dawn members in syros went out and made a racket again . 
  you know what you 'll say . 
  unseen man # 3 : [ indistinct ] that golden dawn members came out and made a racket again . 
  [ repeats some times ] unseen man # ? 
  bald man [ approaching the camera ] : get out of here . 
  get out of here . 
  now . 
  come . 
  we ( maybe he meant `` you '' ? ), 
  have nothing to do here , come !, 
  [ end scene ] ** edit : ** since some people downvoted my translation , i guess you think i translated something incorrectly . 
  i did n't claim to be a professional but i tried my best to convey what was being said . 
  if you disagree with some of it , downvote me by all means if you feel like it but at least comment about the issue so others ( and i ) know what 's up . 
   but in the wake of this week 's events , the government announced it would send its migration minister , yiannis mouzalas , to chios over the weekend . 
  18 degrees and sunny in chios for saturday and sunday . 
  in other words , mouzalas is taking the weekend off and pacifying the natives and immigrants at the same time . 
  do politicians have any kind of qualifications in your country ? 
  are you sure you are an earthling ? 
  you are not welcome in this continent any more , pick up your country and go to another . 
  we suggest antarctica , you would find the weather familiar . 
  / j i will shut up now ... 
  your mileage may vary i guess . 
  from my perspective it 's worse than most people abroad think . 
   but i will probably get downvoted in this sub for saying it there are * a lot * of people going around in this sub , it is unfair to make assumptions about the whole group the same way you do n't want redditors to make assumptions about the general public opinion in the uk based on the cases on the news . 
  most people are well aware that the uk is quite safe despite the fact that some few bigots have ( hopefully wrongfully ) decided it 's * their time * , and crawled out of the woodwork . 
  that said , do n't deny us the banter . 
  i think he might be doing all this for the domestic market only , to gather support among the demographic who 'd think `` he 's an honest , decent bloke who went and straight up told the italian what 's what '' . 
  i 'm not sure he cares about the effects of his antics on the uk , if the effect on his own political capital is positive . 
  [ according to wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pizza ) : `` the term was first recorded in the 10th century , in a latin manuscript from gaeta in central italy . 
  the modern pizza was invented in naples , italy [ ... ] '', 
  i thought you just threw everything in a pot and heated until all the taste and texture had boiled away ? 
  you do n't choose the sociopath life , the sociopath life chooses you . 
  well , actually , eu free movement does n't cover all the people in the world . 
  farage fought to limit the movement of uk citizens and won , but he 's still one of them . 
  true . 
  still , he is advocating for a cold war between the eu and the us+uk . 
  i think that 's quite insane . 
  regardless of who `` wins '' , humanity and civilization lose . 
  the greek deputy minister of health is a ( not ) nice example of someone unashamedly smoking whenever and wherever he feels like it . 
  greece can not into multiple areas ? 
  :( i 'll have you know , our public sector corruption is up to par with eastern european ( bad ) standards , and even going full african by many accounts . 
   even though its severe issue we are still talking about a few thousand cases . 
  `` the agency estimated that there were tens of thousands of victims . 
  it said previous estimates of 10,000-13 ,000 victims in the uk were found to be the `` tip of the iceberg '' . '', 
  `` tens of thousands '' is way too many thousand cases in this kind of thing . 
  is `` salt '' a buzzword ? 
  in what context ? 
  [ superiority , by arthur c. clarke ] ( http://www.mayofamily.com/rlm/txt_clarke_superiority.html ) `` we were defeated by one thing only - by the inferior science of our enemies . '', 
  you pulled a good [ kenm ] ( / r/kenm ) there . 
  any idea who the greek guy is ? 
  i 'm not up to date on my shipping/smuggling tycoons . 
  thing is , the work situation is completely different between three groups : the people who work in the private sector , the people who work in the public sector , and the people who `` work '' in the public sector . 
  i thought it was a weird title for / r/subredditsimulator and did a double take . 
  but how far can a trebuchet throw a projectile ? 
  [ i agree .

  i saw one once , when i got paid my salary in cash for some reason . 
  it was really depressing working a month for just two banknotes , regardless of the numbers on them . 
  give me a pack of 50s or 20s any day . 
  `` people '' ? 
  i know you are joking , but it 's interesting to see how perceptions of a `` proper '' public image changed over the years . 
  when she was young , it was probably still uncommon to smile in a photo . 
  anyway , considering her background , she has been relatively casual in her life . 
  for example , she married philip against her parents ' wishes , and celebrated incognito with random people in the streets when ww2 ended ( iirc ) . 
  also , apparently she drives like a complete lunatic . 
  the fast and the furious : lizzie 's range rover . 
  trying really hard not to make the obvious `` racep tayyip son of a. . . '' joke . 
  i guess i just kinda did . 
  6 whole euros ? 
  can i borrow a couple of them ? 
  european solidarity and stuff . 
  ~ greece , probably, 
  all i see is not enough coal . 
  ~ d.t. 
  one of the problems i do n't see mentioned often is that there are different levels of enforcement in different countries . 
  i remember when i went from greece to the uk , i found it amazing that the minimum wage was relevant , and when you applied for a job you could take for granted that you would be legally employed . 
   he had a meeting with trump a while ago , with merkel some days ago and he will meet with macron soon `` hey , guys , we might go a bit civil war-y soon , please do n't bomb us . 
  we 'll do the ceausescu maneuver , we 'll sort it out ourselves . 
  kbye . '',
