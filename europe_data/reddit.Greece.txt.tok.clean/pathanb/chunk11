  i got naked on the spot , although i am generally shy and certainly do n't usually show my danglies to strangers . 
  humans are weird social animals . 
   you can find 10 % of retarded ... 
  i mean uneducated people in almost any group i guess ( 10 % imo is not much ) [ checks out . 
  ] ( https://www.axios.com/how-many-americans-support-trumps-paris-deal-withdrawal-2444957529.html ), 
  i feel somewhat offended . 
  is greece not considered civilized enough to be a target of isis ? 
  why do n't they ever hate on us ? 
  if your external genitalia feel uncomfortable unless you sit like a prostitute at work , you should see your doctor . 
  wow , that 's an eye-opener . 
  i was under the impression that albania and their mafia were somehow special . 
  in retrospect this might have been a product of the domestic - somewhat racist - narrative i 've been exposed to . 
  thanks for taking the time to answer . 
  this show does n't get the recognition it deserves . 
  especially if the mafia does half of the running of the country . 
  edit : i have no personal opinion on the matter . 
  i just took the [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albanian_mafia ) at face value . 
  is it wrong ? 
  i do n't know if it 's a craze , but it does help relieve stress , so i can see why it could be a hit among adults . 
  hey , that 's uncalled for . 
  love your wife !, 
  just wait until emperor trump 's first crusade and the nuking of lisbon . 
  / jk , hopefully, 
  maybe it 's just conservative passive-aggression ? 
   `` george was set on fire . '', 
   `` it did not go too far . '', 
  is this guy 's warning light completely broken , or what ? 
   crimes of eastern europeans ok , by now i take it as granted that we are stereotyped as lazy and uncultured , but crimes ? 
  what crime is a random greek going to sweden ( eg . 
  to study ) guilty of ? 
  do you feel ok ? 
  the triple parentheses are depressing . 
  i never thought punctuation could ever be such an emotional issue for me . 
  `` remember when europe was n't boring , and changed its national borders all the time ? 
  let 's bring that back !, 
  let 's keep it interesting ! '', 
  the title should be that `` anarchists fill the * power * void left by faltering greek governance '' . 
  gd had been `` helping '' like that for ages before it became a political party . 
  as / u/greekball said , it 's a means to gather social support . 
  immigrants might not have voting rights at the moment , but they are not going anywhere any time soon , so they are defacto members of greek society now , and very vulnerable at that , so easy to recruit . 
  anarchists routinely attack police forces , firebomb buses and destroy public and private property in athens . 
  they also have their own intimidating and violent `` security forces '' semi-permanently in place in at least one area in the center of athens ( i live there , so that 's all i can talk about with certainty ) , and have performed `` official '' murders in the past . 
  they are far from peaceful philanthropists . 
  they are violent extremists with a veneer of helpfulness . 
  whether they consider themselves that is irrelevant , and whether they are better or worse than gd , we should n't care . 
  both groups crossed the moral event horizon a long time ago . 
  edit : i see massive downvoting of my comment , but no replies . 
  do you not believe the reports of violence ? 
  or are you pro-violence when it supports your group ? 
  or maybe you think that [ whoever does that does n't count as a real anarchist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/no_true_scotsman ) ? 
  maybe i miffed the gd crowd ? 
  maybe something else ? 
  usa was two better than lebanon under obamacare . 
  i 'd be interested to see their position next year with the new budget cuts . 
  the parents not only failed to consult a doctor , apparently they did n't even try a quick google search . 
  according to [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lactose_intolerance ) , the only way a baby can be permanently lactose intolerant is a * very rare * genetic disorder . 
  developmental lactose intolerance may also occur in premature babies but usually improves over a short period of time . 
  people who are lactose intolerant ( like the 10 % of the population of northern europe , or 95 % in parts of asia and africa ) typically develop the intolerance in their late childhood or early adulthood . 
  if you think about it it 's not a surprise , since babies who could n't use their only source of nutrition would have been weeded out of the gene pool for millennia . 
  * greece sadly returns to the mainland , the ring it never got to give still in her pocket . 
  in a fit of dejected passive aggression , she starts making fun of the cypriots ' accent . 
   constantinople in this instance the name is accurate though , is n't it ? 
  the city was renamed much later . 
  he 'll probably be dead in a few generations even if he does n't wait . 
  i think his point is that killing them makes them into martyrs , while shutting them down fades them to obscurity . 
  he is not less evil , he is just more pragmatically , less cartoonishly evil . 
  why do n't centrists hold `` serious '' convictions ? 
  you do n't have to be batshit crazy to be mentally ill . 
  it is common for people to use food to cope with depression , uncontrolled stress or other issues , and obesity can also be the cause of the issues in the first place , creating a vicious circle . 
  i googled it up to see if i was in the wrong here , but there are a lot of references connecting obesity and mental health problems . 
  [ here is a study establishing a bidirectional relationship between obesity and depression ] ( http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/210608 ) ( journal of american medical association ) . 
  might be an internet myth ( and i 'm too lazy to look up its veracity ) , but are n't muslims allowed to lie to heathens ? 
  what you describe as `` lazy '' is usually undiagnosed mental health problems . 
  we should stop sanitising obesity as anything less than the result of mental illness . 
   mississippi of europe to be fair , it could be money from the mississippi of the us driving this . 
  * byzantine sadness intensifies * :(, 
   ` you can not detain and persecute people who simply do not exist in the republic ' well , that sounds reassuring ... oh , wait . 
  hey !, 
  late thirties is not old . 
  is it ? 
  asking for a friend . 
  atheist , unelected god-emperor of mankind all the way !, 
  i just realized that this sounds like christ 's resurrection is a conclusion from the egg breaking . 
  next up : checking the resurrected christ to see if he weighs as much as a duck . 
  probably the root of our own '' \u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9 '' too . 
  can confirm , your girls stole two of my friends away in the last few years . 
  stop that !, 
  ^ ^ or ^ ^ steal ^ ^ me ^ ^ too ... 
  our homegrown far-left terrorists usually give warning beforehand to avoid casualties , as they did this time too . 
  if there were no injuries and precautions were taken not to cause them , i think you can see why this in not as big a deal as people trying ( and succeeding ) to gruesomely murder as many random people as they can . 
  that 's not to say that causing material damage and endangering people should n't land these guys in jail . 
  greek media report this stuff , but you have to understand that in athens there are firebomb attacks and property damage almost every single night . 
  only a timed bomb ( like this ) or human injury can be considered newsworthy anymore on a local level . 
  it 's understandable if international news agencies consider this `` business as usual '' and filter it off . 
  this is a year of elections in france and germany . 
  they are key nations of the eu , and there is little chance they 'll risk messing up the refugee deal and strengthening the far-right before september 's german federal elections . 
  please do n't do le stupid , mon ami france !, 
  john oliver spoke french and smoked for you , this should count for something !, 
  maybe he was proud of it and new he would n't get in trouble ? 
  the delay is the plan , because it forces much harder measures to make up for lost time .
