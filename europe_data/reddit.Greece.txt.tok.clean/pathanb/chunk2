  i 'm not sure what kind of assholes murder people in cold blood , but i 'm guessing it was either some greek ultra-nationalists ( who were rare beasts back then in the times of plenty ) or a false flag to persecute a christian minority when albania was struggling to re-establish its religious identity . 
  i lean towards the former . 
  either way , what defined them was n't being greek or albanian , it was being criminals . 
  lets not lose sight of this . 
  yes , what sexually active teens need is more reasons to avoid going to the doctor if something feels wrong ... 
  yeah , that hitler chap was a really mediocre painter . 
  and not eating meat ? 
  what 's with that ? 
  athenian here , i am all for that . 
  it will make moving to germany to work much easier ( i 'll just stay home ) . 
  i second the `` yoke '' thing . 
  it 's how it is called in greece too . 
  greeks are taught about it in school by its greek name '' \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03b6\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1 '' - child gathering . 
  it is considered ( by the populace , historians probably do n't judge morality ) an evil act and a great tragedy . 
  i do n't think we ever got the memo that we should be cool about it . 
  erdogan also said yesterday : `` we will not be prisoners of 780,000 square kilometres '' ( the current area of turkey ) . 
  ... should i start dusting my good fez ? 
  you have n't paid taxes for them . 
  probably a huge problem in tax-dodging greece , where exactly 0 nuclear weapons were registered to be taxed last year . 
  i think it is mainly a coloring of just whether they are for or against , with the only qualifier being if a percentage is close to 50 % ( which could topple the other way relatively easily ) . 
  we will be defending european home turf . 
  this is something the people can get behind , if we manage to stop hating each other for a bit . 
  greece and turkey came close to war once over and uninhabited rock ( tbh , it was all about its territorial waters ) . 
  '' * my * rock ! '', 
  bonus news bite from then : `` bill clinton was informed by turkish prime minister tansu \u00c7iller that turkey and greece are starting a war because two turkish journalists and some greek boatmen had a scuffle on a rock inhabited by a goat . '', 
   in collaboration with german forces we found the german collaborators !, 
  / j seriously , phrases like this still sound bad in greece , almost a century after ww2 . 
  let it not be said that we do n't hold grudges . 
  i thought only the [ spanish inquisition ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqrerufrkxm ) was sneaky . 
  had my car window randomly broken in the exarheia area where i live on sunday ( no theft , just vandalism ) . 
  just the latest in a series of attacks on my 15yo vw polo , a car that is surely owned by a banker , politician , or the illuminati . 
  i second the existence of people just `` looking for any excuse to destroy shit '' . 
  i think it is widely known since last year that the greek eastern border is kinda porous . 
  so is the albanian and bulgarian border . 
  i once crossed into bulgaria unintentionally with my car , through a mountain road . 
  i drove towards a bulgarian village until i realized something was off , then drove right back to greece the way i had come . 
  if hundreds of thousands of people can leak through the borders , you can bet half an army 's worth of weapons and ammo can too . 
  ( also , drugs . 
  lots of drugs . ), 
  `` thus started the 120-year pan-european cheese war . '', 
  this looks a bit like the head of my dad on a sword . 
  at least on the subject of nuclear weapon use , he has said on the record that '' [ you want to be unpredictable ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvtaaj1fzfc ) '' . 
  in context it is obvious he meant `` keep threats fearing that they might get nuked '' , which is a departure from the policy of nukes as strictly a nuclear deterrent . 
  he probably has the same strategy in other subjects of policy too . 
  if this is true it is shrewd realpolitik . 
  and i really , really hope it is so , because the alternative , having a grown baby control the world 's largest army and a nuclear arsenal is not ... nice . 
  `` turkish nationalist boxing gang '' ? 
  this title looks like something out of / r/subredditsimulator . 
  news is getting weirder by the day ... 
   ca n't be with the dick in the ass and the soul in the heaven at the same time . 
  priests have been teaching the exact opposite to choir boys for ages . 
  proper answer to the hillbilly : `` no , i am talking about this guy in the sack behind you , who is literally a pig . '', 
  seriously , i stared at the pig photo for a long time . 
  `` your ideal city is south-west , within walking distance from your house . '', 
  very convenient , if a bit dull . 
  there is an argument that it does n't work very well exactly because it is not a federation . 
  the eu tried economic integration with a much less substantial political integration , despite the fact that economics are an ( if not the only ) important political issue . 
  let me note here that `` not working '' only applies to the direct economic and political boost part of the union . 
  where it has definitely worked is that there has not been a war between member states for more than half a century . 
  remember , we are europe . 
  for 2.000 + years we have honed the art of murdering each other . 
  peace is no small thing , and the social , political and economic advantages are very substantial , if not so apparent . 
  ironically , the confidence to doubt the eu 's purpose comes from the relative prosperity it has helped bring for more than a generation . 
  [ official brexit policy ] ( https://krogeriwireless.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/string-tied-around-finger-crop1-585x250.jpg ), 
  shush kebab raki , i 'm just saying that to get more pity loans . 
  i 'm not forgetting you bro . 
  yeah , but romania is n't doing it right , what with reducing corruption and all . 
  they were meant to make us feel better by being worse off than us , not show us the way to get better !, 
  i am so poor , my defense budget ca n't afford typing anything aggressive . 
   under such circumstances the reforms are guaranteed to fail . 
  which is the plan , apparently . 
   send them to germany ? 
  afaik , the official plan was just that , or to use them to blackmail the rest of europe to give us $ $ $ . 
  there was a very telling quote by panos kamenos , minister of defense and leader of the far right party in the coalition government , on how he sees them : [ `` if the lenders hit greece ( in the talks with yanis varoufakis ) , we 'll send the immigrants to berlin . 
  '' ] ( http://www.skai.gr/news/politics/article/276903/kammenos-an-i-europi-htupisei-tin-ellada-stelnoume-tous-metanastes-verolino/ )  yeah , sounds logical . 
  if you ca n't change greece , change the world . 
  there is a nice greek saying about this : `` either the coast is wrong , or we are sailing wrong '' . 
  well , it could be one big independent state . 
   i 'm sure the spartans and the athenians were certain they would never be on the same side , let alone in one country . 
  but given time and shifts in public perception , these things can change . 
  my dad told me when i was little that `` good is what brings people together , evil what divides them . '', 
  not sure if it is someone else 's quote or dad wisdom oc , but now at 37 i find that i still largely agree with this . 
  yay !, 
  the family has n't disowned us !, 
  ... yet . 
  on one side , we have keyboard warriors . 
  on the exact opposite side , we have these two chaps . 
  approximate translation of the article : ------------------------------------------ the government aims to undermine the right-wing policies it is asked to implement said the member of syriza panos lambrou , adviser to the ministry of justice , a few days ago on an interview on website commonality.gr . 
  `` how can you implement left-wing policy when you are implementing right-wing ? 
  you need to find a way to undermine the right-wing policy to consciously open new roads '' he said characteristically . 
  `` we knelt , we fell ( in august ' 15 ) , but we have to rise - as we often did - and climb the mountain again , to the top of the mountain , to pave a different way '' . 
  the aim of syriza is to change the world , not to manage the misery , even if this seems difficult or impossible , says mr lambrou . 
  he also categorically opposed the eu - turkey agreement , describing it as a `` treaty '' that was n't successful in any way . 
  `` turkey is not a safe third country , and germany and visegrad ask us to recognize it as such when they wo n't ... 
  they want us to do the dirty work '' , he says . 
  raki : the real spirit ( ha ) of turkish-greek friendship . 
  did you call for a greek armchair warrior ? 
  i am one of many , and at your service !, 
  i will do whatever it takes , as long as i do n't need to get off my chair or put pants on . 
  i do n't like you / u/lmolari , i think you might be a pkk supporter , like all germans .
