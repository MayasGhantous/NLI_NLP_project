  this situation can too easily blow in our face . 
   hurt fist please tell me the guy punched the terrorist so hard he hurt his fist ... 
  the translation is mine . 
  skai is a large , mainstream tv and radio station . 
  i think it 's an interesting tidbit because it goes to show how erdogan seems to be creating a self-serving narrative for internal consumption regardless of the facts . 
  according to high-ranking officers of the hellenic air force general staff , the presidential aircraft of rajep tayip erdogan was not pursued during the failed coup attempt of friday . 
  the turkish president maintained that , on friday night , his aircraft was intercepted by aircraft piloted by insurgents . 
  along the same lines were the statements of a turkish official in reuters who stated that the turkish president `` avoided death by just a few minutes '' . 
  but as a high-ranking source of the hellenic airforce disclosed to skai , greek radars monitored the flight of the presidential aircraft of the turkish president until it landed in constantinople and , according to the observation data , rajep tayip erdogan 's business jet `` was neither accompanied by turkish f-16s nor was it intercepted by other aircraft '' . 
  yes . 
  only defensively , and only if the standing army is not enough . 
  `` pre-emptive strikes '' are not defensive in my book , by the way . 
  i already have basic training ( like most greek men ) . 
  i hated it . 
  i understand the need to be able to sometimes take up arms though , so i grudgingly support it in greece . 
  not sure it would be needed with a unified eu standing army though . 
  more or less . 
  i do mountain hikes and jogging but i 'm slightly overweight , pushing 40 in a desk job . 
  computer programming , basic infantry training , lieutenant training/basic squad command . 
  i seriously do n't want to shoot at people , and certainly do n't want to be shot at . 
  but i guess a defensive war would put us all out of our comfort zone . 
  let me note here that the main reason i support the creation of an eu army is because it would force the country members to unreservedly support each other in times of need . 
  signed words on paper are all nice and dandy , but we 've seen many times in the past years that they do n't always survive crises , let alone war . 
  i personally think that if no one initiated violence the world would be a better place . 
  still , there are those who do , and the roman proverb is sadly still true today : * si vis pacem , para bellum . 
  * - if you want peace , prepare for war . 
  [ `` president erdogan says freedom and democracy have ` no value ' in turkey amid arrests and military crackdown '' ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/president-erdogan-says-freedom-and-democracy-have-no-value-in-turkey-amid-arrests-and-military-a6938266.html ) that was back in march . 
  his resignation was actually a shrewd political move . 
  this way he wo n't be confronted with the impossibility of what he promised , it will just be the fault of others implementing brexit wrong . 
  then , after things are well under way for better or worse , he can come back untarnished in his triumph , `` sadly '' too late to fix things . 
  i think his ideal outcome would be a bremain so he can cry `` vote fraud '' and whatnot but , like our tsipras , in the end he had to make do with the sad reality that he won the referendum and was running out of excuses ... 
   planning and execution of operations , in so far as they may be necessary , beyond the borders of turkey to capture or incapacitate persons who , having carried out [ disruptive ] actions in turkey , have sought refuge in a neighbouring country . 
  as a greek , i am very troubled about this clause that seems to fit exactly the case of those 8 guys we are stuck with . 
  today they were moved to kavala , further away from turkey `` for security reasons '' . 
  i 'm beginning to wonder if that 's far enough . 
  edit : i hope erdogan realizes that a special forces operation in a greek city is offence on a completely different scale from just flying jets over our islands . 
  depends . 
  greek tax rates take into account tax dodging , and try to keep to their income targets regardless . 
  this means that for the people who actually pay taxes ( mostly because they either ca n't , or are afraid to dodge them ) , the taxes are huge . 
  they have to make up for all the people who do n't pay . 
  this increases public income in the short term , but a lot of people just pay taxes off their savings and run dry after a while . 
  then it 's either personal ruin or trying to bribe and tax dodge your way out of it . 
  the current tax situation has made illegality an issue of survival for many . 
  * source : * i own an empty plot of land in a good neighborhood of athens . 
  the economy is so stagnant that i can not find any honest offer ( i was offered payment of my taxes to `` take it off my hands '' ) . 
  it bleeds me of about 20.000 euros in taxes a year , much more than i make , but i used to have some savings too . 
  yeah , i know i 'm stubborn , but this is the only asset i own . 
  nevertheless , this is the last year i can pay the tax . 
  next year , i will have to give it to the state as payment . 
  then i 'll have nothing left here and i might look for work in some other , proper country . 
  i 'm duolingo-ing the hell out of german in my spare time . 
  any idea if there is a market for programmers there ? 
  you missed the caveat in his question : he 's asking for * net * income . 
  that 's after taxes . 
  he 's on to us . 
  well , all the prisoners ( including the high ranking officers ) shown on tv were visibly beaten . 
  one guy ( head of airforce ? 
  i might remember wrong ) had an ear/side of the head bandaged the second time he was shown on tv , not he first , meaning he `` fell and hit his head '' while he was in custody . 
  also , there were videos of soldiers who had already surrendered to the police getting beaten and/or humiliated by the mob without any police intervention . 
  `` i did n't do it , civilians did it '' does n't cut it as an excuse , at least for outside observers . 
  you know , tayip , you can tell who is an academic by their glasses ... ~ dictator life hacks . 
  to the anatolian gulags with them !, 
  in article 38 of the turkish [ * constitution * ] ( https://global.tbmm.gov.tr/docs/constitution_en.pdf ) :  no one shall be given a heavier penalty for an offence other than the penalty applicable at the time when the offence was committed . 
  uk turk : an elegant turk , for a more civilized age . 
  your comment was intellectually stimulating . 
  please tell us more . 
  he has a hold on turkish media and justice , and he 'll only use this coup attempt as an excuse to tighten it to a stranglehold . 
  i do n't know if any of his detractors will be left standing when the dust settles ... 
  the lukewarm coffee prophecy has come to pass !, 
  putin will now descend to the balkans and middle east to free all the peoples from themselves !, 
  so it is written , so it shall be !, 
  we actually have a newspaper in greece which plays this kind of stories completely straight , every damn day . 
  i always wonder what kind of person reads these titles or articles and goes `` yeah , i always knew kitbuqa 's coffee would be lukewarm one of these days . 
  i saw the signs . 
  praise putin ! '', 
  bonus music video : [ `` with putin , i 'm not afraid '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9o8tfuvg4 ), 
  this coup has been evolving for a while . 
  erdogan has been following the exact same path with putin , both in the steps of one historic adolf . 
   pkk breaks the truce and literally allows erdogan to get re elected and now this did n't erdogan actually bomb pkk first to break the truce ? 
  iirc when he passed the ( too generic ) terror law that was supposed to allow him to bomb isis , he proceeded to bomb pkk instead . 
  i might be wrong , i 'll check for sources later . 
  figure of speech , but funny thing is i actually do have something like a `` book '' . 
  i have a monster text file on my desktop with notes about anything and everything , alphabetically . 
  relevant excerpt with neighboring entries to expose my ignorance :  latvia : lithuania hat , sto here be dragons apenanti apo stockholm , \u039b\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 ,  \u039b\u03b5\u03ba\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 : toner recycle [ * contact info redacted * ]  lidl : parmezan piece ok , chicken no , \u03c6\u03b1\u03c3\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac , \u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b6\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1  lithuania : thingie over poland , piece russia on west wtf google , elves !, 
  googling about that orphan piece of russia west of lithuania still pending , 2 years after making the note . 
  suddenly lithuania became very awesome in my book . 
  well , to be realistic , we are still going to take their jobs . 
  i 'm being offered my dream job in milton keynes because apparently they have n't found any interested brit in over a year . 
  having to jump through a few more hoops wo n't make a difference . 
  i rather expected a europa universalis screenshot ... 
  the `` birthplace of democracy '' has become an argument against it . 
  now that 's rough . 
  the government is elected to ( ideally ) represent the majority of the people in the majority of the issues the way they would themselves . 
  representative democracy is not meant to take power away from the people , just to delegate it . 
  in that respect it was right to call a referendum on the eu membership , because it is too big an issue to bundle up with all the other stuff that go into choosing a government . 
  that said , the issue of giving voice to the many versus consulting the few who `` know better '' has been relevant for over 2000 years , at least since socrates ' apology which brought up the issue . 
  i do n't think there is an objectively `` perfect '' balance to this , which way it leans is more of a sum of the sociopolitical circumstances . 
  democracy is a study in contradictions , i 'm afraid . 
  you went almost 80 years without invading anyone , that 's more than anyone could expect from germany . 
  the alphabet differences are n't that much of an issue , the similarities are much greater .
