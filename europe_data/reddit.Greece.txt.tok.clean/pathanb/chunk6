  also bear in mind that we are in constant contact with english ( and latin alphabets in general ) so they do n't look half as arcane to us as cyrillic or greek look to you . 
  english is effectively a ` default ' world language , similar to the common tongue in d&d . as for me , i was taught some english by my parents before i started school , then started lessons in primary school . 
  computers and later d&d and fantasy/science fiction books sealed the deal . 
  `` command '' , `` error '' , `` ready '' and `` run '' were some of the first words i learned ( from an amstrad cpc computer ) . 
  i remember having the english-greek dictionary on my computer desk for years , and i still have my first english book , asimov 's `` i , robot '' in simplified english . 
   maybe they 're trying to be edgy and enlightened ? 
  no need to be nasty . 
  as economies and societies become more expansive , people are more and more willing to take part in larger groups . 
  the `` flattening '' of the specific needs of the parts is an expected side effect . 
  it was so when individuals stayed in a family group , when family groups made a town , when towns made a state . 
  some think it is time for europe to take the next step , that there is more bringing us together than dividing us now . 
  for now i disagree with that , but i understand the sentiment . 
  edit : `` thing '' / `` think '' typo . 
  `` my name is bond . 
  ... and burn the image of allah or the prophet ? 
  you remind me of that conundrum with saddam 's qur ` an ( someone correct me if i remember the particulars wrong ) : he had one written in his own blood . 
  apparently , the book is sinful because of that and would have been destroyed , but the words are holy and it 's a sin to destroy them . 
  logic threw its hands in the air and walked out , and afaik it 's still locked somewhere and everyone tries not to think about it . 
  edit : [ found it in wikipedia . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blood_quran ), 
  yeah , it kinda makes a difference what we are best at : `` best at making wine '' : we are cool provincial people . 
  not bad . 
  `` best at making soap '' : could be that our olive oil soaps are just great , but hearing the phrase from the germans is kinda worrying ... 
  pronounce ` y ' like in `` yet '' . 
  it 's worth noting that this number is generally irrelevant in greece , since there is practically no traffic policing . 
  people commonly do over 100 km/h in central athens avenues , congestion permitting . 
   very undervalued invest now ? 
  an expert hit , comrade fitness center !, 
  actually , the problem with greece is that it only does a subset of what was agreed , what it does it does way too late , and ( still ) tries to fudge the books or lie its way out . 
  both economics and politics are time sensitive , so while the greek government is busy not acting as agreed , the original plan goes to hell and a new plan is needed . 
  the new plan needs to meet the same targets , on the same deadline , but with much of the time already wasted . 
  whether the uk will descend to this level of political shortsightedness , i can not tell . 
  the go-to answer for greece , in one way or another , is always `` corruption '' . 
  regardless of the question . 
  q : what 's up ? 
  a : corruption ... 
  \\* * automated voice * \\* * directing you to nearest pub . 
  * * nearest pub is . 
  centimeters . 
  away . 
  automation will also probably impact native labourers equally as well . 
  saying it will only replace the migrants is dishonest spin . 
  edit : one `` will '' too many . 
  obama had an average of 34.6 eos/year , about average for a us president , fewer than gw bush , ghw bush , clinton and reagan . 
  trump right now is averaging 118.6 eos/year ( projected ofcourse ) . 
  there is no comparison .

  this is getting too much like a mirror of the real world for my liking ... 
  \\* * greece declares day of national mourning * \\* :(, 
  we have reached the point where april 1st has n't made any difference to the absurdity of the news . 
  next up : erdogan declares german babies `` ugly and dumb '' . 
  do n't say that , something something , `` the north remembers '' . 
  i just woke up and my funny bone is still asleep . 
   can we stop mentioning lithuania here ? 
  but it 's going so well !, 
  third day , and you already got your independence back !, 
   immigrants wo n't be able to take british jobs anymore if not enough brits train and apply for the jobs that cover the needs of the economy , brexit wo n't make much difference . 
  eg : the nhs will keep hiring foreign doctors over homegrown laborers . 
  she is an old lady , belongs to an anti-war group , has lost two sons , and these guys attacked her * because they recognized her * ? 
  this is almost cartoonishly evil . 
  when the perpetrators inevitably sneak out of the consulate for some more attacks , i half expect them to firebomb the `` all-puppy parade for love and tenderness '' . 
  it does n't matter if you were german or not before this thread . 
  by saying this , you are now 100 % german . 
  southern europe counter-assault : always go for the liver first . 
  we welcome our sunburnt overlords !, 
  til devil is metric . 
  i live in a relatively poor neighborhood of central athens ( exarhia ) , i personally know people who at times depend on food handouts because they ca n't always afford both food and keeping a roof over their head . 
  i ca n't imagine anyone starving to death , but it 's mostly because of social solidarity , not lack of poverty . 
  it is also tragicomic that when i talk with people living in more affluent parts of athens , they often refuse to believe this is happening . 
  putin : `` that will do pig , that will do . '', 
  til that we exile our researchers to crete . 
  it 's worth noting that this guy was a convicted violent criminal for decades before he became a muslim . 
  for him , his interpretation of islam was clearly just one more in a long list of excuses to be an asshole , not the cause of his crimes . 
  that . 
  i did some research about it when i was kinda thinking of a final solution for myself . 
  nitrogen death is by hypoxia ( painless ) , co2 death is by poisoning ( painful ) . 
  there is a bbc documentary that explores nitrogen as a humane form of execution for people ( where they are still practiced ) and for killing meat animals without suffering . 
  the presenter even put himself through controlled nitrogen breathing , and although he came close to fainting ( and subsequently dying ) he later said he did n't realize it was `` working '' at all . 
  fascinating , in a kinda alarming way . 
  what is `` omilia '' doing in italy ? 
  that 's greek for `` speech '' . 
   up in the air i spent too long trying to decide if you used this expression on purpose . 
  with the kind of anti-democratic policies he 's enforcing already , is n't there any fear that he 'll rig the referendum ? 
  apply as an austronaut for the esa . 
  you will be safe - at least until erdogan sends armed space kebab in orbit . 
  \\* * furiously sips frappe to improve national score * \\*, 
  saw the map while eating my souvlaki , but had a freddo capuccino in the morning and i do n't think i 'm all that racist . 
  1 out of 3 . 
  i should at least try for 2 out of 3 . 
  i guess it 's frappe in the afternoon . 
  for greece !, 
  4d chess , he learned from trump . 
  well , brexit * is * a more important issue than / r/europe shitposts , so yeah . 
  we 'll probably get back to that , among other things . 
  shitposts will be removed . 
  serious posts will be allowed . 
  serious shitposts will not exist . 
  i [ like ] ( https://i.imgflip.com/1ltdtg.jpg ) how you have `` unemployed '' as your username . 
  the post you replied to is very interesting because it shows the kind of propaganda that is commonplace in turkey . 
  in the rest of the world it sounds comically untrue , but all the conspiracy theories ergodan 's system disseminates are only for internal consumption and believing them seems to be common there .
