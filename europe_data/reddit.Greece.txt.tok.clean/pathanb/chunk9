  sadly , we are nearing a straight decade of domestic propaganda pointing to the people who lend us money as the main source of our woes . 
  in a completely unrelated incident , parliament member dies in tragic accident . 
  i do n't see how it is mocking . 
  spain is just saying that scotland does not have the authority to negotiate for itself ( exactly like a region of spain wink , wink ) because it is a part of the uk . 
  i 'm sure it is annoying to many scots ( and i sympathise ) , but is n't it true ? 
  wow , you must have hit a nerve if someone made a throwaway just to shit-talk you ... 
  is ... being a sheep popular in the rest of europe ? 
  i 've never been one , and now i kinda feel left out . 
  this sub is about geographical europe , and the eu is currently an important entity of geographical europe . 
  that said , of course posts like this attract comments from eu federalists ( like me ) . 
  i do n't see the harm in having our fun . 
  and i 'm sure both banter and serious opinions against federalism are more than welcome if in good spirit . 
  i heard you like federations ... 
  from all sides , i 'd hope !, 
  spain will build a wall on the border and make portugal pay for it !, 
  #makespaingreatagain / j, 
  the surreal moment when she breaks up with me , then makes a scene when i ask her to take her stuff from my apartment . 
  i think romania is not trying hard enough to be corrupt . 
  corruption is supposed to be counter-productive , not trailblazing !, 
  bear in mind that there is social stigma for suicides in greece . 
  you also ca n't get a religious funeral which is still very ( socially ) important to many families . 
  it 's a safe bet suicides are under-reported . 
  in the last year i have read about brexit , about turkey 's internal and external hijinks , about trump and his election , even about greek politics , and i always finished the articles . 
  with this , my brain just shut down and could n't concentrate on the text after a while . 
  i 'm wondering if this piece of news was so ridiculous that i could n't take it , or it 's just 2016 stupidity fatigue that has added up to intolerable levels by the end of november . 
  have an upvote , you monster !, 
  i was going for a black joke , but i guess it fell flat . 
  greece has the same opt-out system . 
  do you know if it is an eu thing/directive ? 
  i bet they have a huge sign with the town name facing towards the german border . 
   y ( which is twinned with llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch , in wales ) the name y was so short , it left enough space for the other town 's name to unfold to its full glory . 
  in completely unrelated tragic news , the death rate of registered organ donors in spain has increased by 12 % from 2015 . 
  `` no , russian agents are not behind every piece of fake news you see '' - '' ... but putin is getting aroused thinking of the prospect '' . 
  in my opinion too , charlie hebdo content is stupid and in bad taste . 
  but stupid crap have a right to be expressed as well , as long as they do n't cross a ( hazy , culture-dependent , hotly debated ) line . 
  and ofcourse the public is free to ignore them anyway . 
  in a tangentially related issue , i find that many people who claim they are `` silenced '' by the media , public etc. 
  seem to forget that : 1 . 
  advocating violence against a group is not in the same league as making fun of them . 
  people might ignore you anyway if they think what you say is stupid . 
  a couple greek ones : http://www.naftemporiki.gr/english rather sensationalist , but i see it linked here a lot : http://en.protothema.gr/, 
  but ... italian bros !, 
  why caution in most of greece ? 
  especially the freedom to curtail freedoms ... 
  that was ... beautiful . 
  if turkey fulfills the requirements it would mean that the objections these countries have will no longer be valid . 
  there is very small chance of turkey doing all that needs to be done , but that 's not the eu 's issue , the requirements have been clear all along . 
  turkey is stringing us along , not the opposite . 
  fair enough about the cyprus invasion . 
  the problem with nato is that it is meant as a us tool against outside enemies , it does n't care about scuffles between members - and turkey is a rather important member because of its position . 
  an eu unified defense would presumably be about defending against outsiders too , with the great difference that turkey would be an outsider then - and turkey is the main and only military danger for greece at the moment as far as i know . 
  the eu would probably react more forcefully against any incursions not necessarily because it cares for greece in particular , but because any turkish advance would reduce eu power and increase that of a neighbouring ( totalitarian ? ), 
  geopolitical competitor . 
  funny thing about greece is that we have erdogan next door who just questioned the validity of the lausanne treaty ( defining turkey 's current borders with greece among other nations ) . 
  imo we should be all for it since our large neighbour is talking about `` liberating '' greek land nowadays . 
  there were 35 chapters they should comply with to enter the eu . 
  they managed to do one in 30 years . 
  i do n't think it 's about the eu not wanting them , it 's about them not trying at all . 
  erdogan is just strategically playing the victim card off the issue over and over , for domestic consumption . 
   turkey should not be `` fixated '' on the idea of joining the european union til that turkey takes 30 years to accomplish 1 out of 35 steps of something it is fixated on . 
  waiting to see how slow it is on stuff it 's * not * fixated on . 
  any insight from turks why this bill is being proposed ? 
  what 's erdogan 's angle ? 
  is he trying to artificially lower child rape conviction numbers ? 
  or is there a weird religious angle to this ? 
  or something else ? 
  i think it 's important not to lose sight of the fact that trump is not just right-leaning , he squarely sits in the cartoonish section of the far-right . 
  he is the living embodiment of a strawman right-winger and an unmitigated jerk to boot . 
  saying that this disgrace of a human being is the one legitimizing the right is selling it short . 
  i 'm not sure what country you are from , but in most places harassment is considered serious . 
  but no , it is n't justified to firebomb the camp or send a boy to the hospital . 
  it also was n't justifiable when some immigrants stole fireworks from a shop and attacked people and buildings with them and rocks . 
  but both are somewhat understandable . 
  both sides are left feeling that the state has forgotten them and they need to fend for themselves . 
  the more hot-headed on either side of the fence are certainly not the majority , but they are left to their own criminal devices regardless . 
  and this is the real problem . 
  the problem is that the greek government is willfully ignoring both the needs of the migrants and the increasingly frustrated locals around the camps . 
  it also does n't seem to be trying at all to keep things from escalating , or looking for the culprits and arresting them when the law is broken . 
  i 'm not saying that the government is trying to create a volatile situation , but i 'm not entirely certain it 's not , either . 
  and that 's scary . 
  i read some article a while ago saying that many of the people crossing into greece have no papers at all - probably from `` safe '' ( - ish ) countries like afganistan but there is no way to tell . 
  this way , if they declare they are syrian and stick to that , they are guaranteed to stay . 
  where can the authorities send them back to ? 
  remember , most of the people handling these requests are incredibly overworked , and in over their heads . 
  last year there were articles about that * one * policeman in lesvos handling all the applications of the thousands of migrants . 
  afaik things are only marginally better nowadays . 
  well , the nature of democracy and the limited attention span of the average voter usually favor better talking , not better action , and the political market has been slowly adjusting to this for decades . 
  for example , many of the current mps in greece are characters out of idiocracy , but they are great at spewing the kind of rhetoric the public responds to . 
  it 's true that democracy is the worst political system ( except for all the others ) . 
  bored greek here : ** title : ** fiery hell and night of fireworks burns suda : tens of fires and rain of stones ** video details : ** try google translate , it gets the gist of it across in its own funny way .

  now they are over there * points away * firing them ... '' reporter : ok . man : they have lit a fire ... reporter : where have they lit a fire ? 
  man : under there . 
  * camera turns * [ indistinct people talking ] reporter : where are you taking them ?

  * reporter walking ahead * reporter : they `` are closed in '' there ( meaning `` are barricaded in '' , probably ) * people carrying away boxes * reporter : what happened ? 
  * people keep carrying away boxes * new man : [ indistinct ] new man : they broke up front and came in .
