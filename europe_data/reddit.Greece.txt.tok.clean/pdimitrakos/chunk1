actually when pasok and nd were at their prime they were getting a combined 90 % , and both parties were corrupt as hell . 
  people voting for someone because they will get their children to a public sector job . 
  also , it is not just how you vote , it 's how you behave . 
  will you pay an extra 200eur to the guy testing you to get your driving license the easy way or will you do it properly with the fear of not passing because you did n't give the 200eur ? 
  will you give extra cash to the doctor at the public hospital to get better treatment/priority ? 
  as a greek i totally agree with this comment . 
  @naurgul : most greeks ( maybe less now than the beginning of the crisis ) will tell you that it 's only external factors that contributed to the downturn of our economy and a you 'll hear a lot of them saying the whole thing was planned and coordinated by evil forces that want greece 's downfall . 
  this means that most people still have n't realised how much they have contributed to this , and that if they do n't change their ways it will get even worse . 
  arguing that our political culture has a lot to do with how the economy and society were badly formed is not wrong at all and it does n't constitute victim blaming . 
  our political culture has inherited a lot of bad habits from its recent and distant past ( i.e. 
  1967-74 junta , ottomans , etc. ), 
  and is complicated to explain in one comment . 
  many prominent figures were warning that greece will default because of its policies decades before all this mess happened . 
  where is japan ? 
  bravo , europe !, 
  i 'd say that applies to your post !, 
  i mentioned why tsipras has no idea of what he 's talking about and i explained why this is not such a big win as people talk about . 
  that 's because tsipras and his party are a bunch of ignorant people who belong to a 3 % party until 3-4 years ago . 
  these people should not be trusted . 
  this election result actually brings syriza _ lower _ results than the ones they got on national elections in 2012 . 
  as gorat said below , municipal elections are different because the candidate does n't have to belong to a party , but can merely be supported by one . 
  a second factor would be kaminis ' ( pasok ) no. 1 spot in athens . 
  what is rather surprising is the low syriza figure , who were expecting a landslide . 
  looking out for euro-elections now . 
  totally agree, 
  it means easter in greek :p, 
  magiritsa is religion . 
  end of story . 
  ( not a christian ), 
  take in some migrants instead, 
  that 's right , but he did n't mention bosniaks , that 's why , 
  as far as i know they have now , but when they came they were treated quite badly . 
  a lot of them were living in poor areas with bad coniditions , but now they are more or less fully assimilated https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nea_smyrni https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nea_ionia, 
  ahem https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bosniaks, 
  interesting !, 
  i totally agree . 
  same thing happened [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/population_exchange_between_greece_and_turkey ) . 
  totally disastrous . 
  the thing is if you look at the second map on the article , bosnia 's immigrants make up only 0.6 % of its population . 
  so it 's probably a really small number . 
  i 'm thinking they also migrated after 1991, 
  no info on data ? 
  passports were probably russian . 
  because kosovo ? 
  all places are interesting . 
  he is probably refering to their ancestors ... 
  not sure about the ` beautiful ' part but agree . 
  ahhh ... balkans . 
  i read that `` soviet barrier troops may have killed as many as 150,000 of their own men over the course of the war , including some 15,000 during the battle of stalingrad . '', 
  even if 150,000 does n't sound big to you , ( which it is ) it is the ** fear ** that this rule brought about to the troops that made them run in the frontline with bad judgement and therefore die easily for no reason . 
  i have also read that the red army was so underequipped in some battles that the ratio of rifles to soldiers was 1:10 , so they had to wait for the soldier with the rifle to die and pick it up after etc. 
  almost all of israel 's population are immigrants, 
  i do !, 
  source ? 
  or [ israel ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israels-nightmare-homegrown-neonazis-in-the-holy-land-396392.html ) !, 
  do n't forget order 227 ... 
  also : go to war for the ussr and die on the frontline by friendly fire , because you stopped going forward . 
  `` order no . 
  227 , '' better known as the `` not one step backward ! '' rule , which decreed that cowards were to be `` liquidated on the spot . '' under this order , any troops who retreated were to be shelled or gunned down by so-called `` blocking detachments '' -- special units who were positioned behind their own lines and charged with shooting any soldier who tried to flee . 
  according to some estimates , soviet barrier troops may have killed as many as 150,000 of their own men over the course of the war , including some 15,000 during the battle of stalingrad . 
  [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/order_no._227 ), 
  took them som time , but they did see the truth !, 
  yes , it 's in the gulags . 
  sadly , no . 
  income inequality is more important than civil liberties ? 
  are you a stalinist ? 
  scotland didnt get invaded . . you 'll never have the same rights as scotland i 'm affraid . 
  vote cameron for stability !, 
  excellent !, 
  i find it clever to have it on a weekday , it shows that there is no actual disruption in everyday life , in the way things work etc. . in greece , election sunday is like a big fiesta and the whole country is paralised . 
  loads of people are still registered to vote in their ( or their parents ' , or their grandparents ' ) hometowns in the rural areas and travel hundreds of miles to get there . 
  it 's a mess . 
  also : why are british immigrants called ` ex-pats ' ? 
  if they do n't go to the uk they 'll just go somewhere else . 
  please do one for athens !!, 
  \u0399 got pretty much the same results on google search using the same search terms in greek , using both `` the english '' and `` the british '', 
  they multiply !, 
  i wish we could !, 
  let 's !, 
  the football league would be insane !, 
  nice post !, 
  exactly, 
  you know all of them ? 
  did n't know you had to be a `` leftie '' to be in favour of the eu project . 
  they 're not real anarchists , they are statists . 
  they protest when pensions and benefits get cut , they protest against public sector employees getting fired . 
  in reality , they 're just in it to look cool and have fun while battling with the riot police , which in greece is always very defensive and passive . 
  so if 51 % of people want the other 49 % to be beheaded then it 's right and reasonable . 
  understandably , it 's much more civilized the way it 's done in france and other countries , here in the balkans , it gets ugly . 
  i would n't mind it if it was done that way over here , it would already be a huge step forward . 
  we get those parades twice a year ( [ march 25th ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_war_of_independence ) and [ october 28 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ohi_day ) ) , and they 're done in every city and even small towns . 
  to be honest it 's the school ones that bother me the most . 
  thank you for your input , bon 14 juillet , vive la france !, 
  it 's very militaristic , i really hate parades . 
  here in greece it 's mandatory for students to participate in the school parades , which [ look really bad , terribly synchronised and outdated ] ( https://youtu.be/lesachmavlk?t=5m5s ) . 
  on the military ones there 's often hate chants against other nations such as turks and albanians , which are being applauded by the people who attend them ( [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa8kgajr7se ) ) . 
  i believe it 's a fascist remnant to do these parades , either military or school ones . 
  you can be proud of your country and your army without those parades imo ( i.e. 
  usa , uk ) . 
  oldie but goodie,
