  fyrom does n't . 
  / s ( also is this in any way based on real research ? ), 
  ah i see , thanks for the input friend . 
  bulgarians ' reactions ? 
   that goes for everyone . 
  i think i was clear . 
  religion is a personal opinion.you are free to practice it in your own space at your own time.you can not impose it on others and above all , society ca n't be ruled by religion.that goes for everyone .

  civil war is too much i think.government needs to relieve pressure to avoid violence , that 's for sure . 
  i 'm pretty sure they misinterpreted his words ... but hey that 's the fun of news am i right ? 
  i mean they earn money that could be spent on defense but it 's kind of controversial as well, 
   another fact worth noting is that athens is the only capital of any european union ( eu ) state that does not have an official place for muslims to worship . 
  well there goes that . 
  the government will be like : `` oh do n't be racist it 's just a cultural thing.european women are too bitchy anyways . 
   changing borders in the balkans has never ended well . 
  that 's true , and neither has taking care of 2m more people, 
  in greece , a new mosque is under construction in athens ( supposedly to satisfy the refugees ' needs ) but i 'm afraid it will create more conflict than it will solve ... 
  i mean really , you 'll climb the acropolis and have a view of it . 
  so essentially , they want kosovo to be included in albania 's national borders , thus making the whole country thing unnecessary ? 
  ok but there are 2 conflicting international laws about this : - each country 's territorial integrity and it 's defence is of outmost importance - free will of the people . 
  so either 100 new countries will pop up or current countries protect their borders.and honestly territorial integrity is more important i think.creating a new country has become incredibly easy and uneccessary in most cases.unless people of a certain ethnic group are actively getting murdered in a daily basis , there 's no reason to create a new national entity apart from a referendum ( where both parts agree ) . 
  why?i mean they are a different country and promote themselves as one . 
   the current status quo is always temporary the status quo of kosovo existing as a separate country or the status quo of it being unrecognised ? 
  kosovars is the correct term . 
  i know right ? 
  if disputed nations participate we might as well call abkhazia and northern cyprus, 
  i was just asking some opinions on the subject by bulgarian reddit users.no need to be sarcastic . 
  what do bulgarians think ? 
  i am very fond of them too , very good relations in the past and in the present i think , 
  i do n't know how bulgarians view us that 's why i said maybe but they 've caused us no trouble in recent years . 
  yeah you 're fellow members of the eu and nato and the most trouble-free neighbours imo  plus it looks like like you 're looking ahead.i too am unsure of how bulgarians view us , but i think our current relations are fine . 
  [ time to change the signs boyzz ] ( http://www.pressalarissa.gr/sites/default/files/unnamed_23.jpg ), 
  cyprus and serbia . 
  edit : maybe bulgaria too , most of our neighbours hate us but i think bulgaria is more civilised . 
  edit2 : and armenia edit3 : just because i did n't put a country in my comment does n't mean i hate them , just to make it clear :p, 
  no need to be rude , it was supposed to be funny anyways.also i can say the same to you you know . 
  fucking hell the past year has been a nightmare.when will these people stop ? 
   macedonia [ whyyyy ??? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8c7uokeapvw ), 
  yeah i was referring to you.thanks for answering.same thing for a friend of mine , english father , greek mother but identifies as english ( raised in england but born in greece i think , anyways ) . 
  do you identify as greek ? 
  the creeping cyprus map behind the sign.but yeah stupid decision . 
  it should n't until it is accepted as an official sovereign state and fixes problems with the country its in dispute with . 
  how can a non-un member be part of fifa , uefa and ioc?let 's invite abkhazia , south ossetia,nagorno-karabakh ... 
  happy independence day !, 
  i understand that it is a fundemental right of the eu but do you think there is more suspicion than there was before even for european citizens ? 
  montenegro is a un member and split from serbia-montenegro in a peaceful way . 
   countries kosovo is not exactly a country, 
  hahah this verb made my day !, 
  we sometimes forget how small european countries really are ... except russia . 
  did she say `` macedonian '' ? 
  no it 's not, 
  im not sure either maybe another user could enlighten us , to me it sounds like an awful decision . 
  they are fucking everywhere ... 
  that surprised me given the current situation in europe, 
  what happened to our land flag ? 
  me neither . 
  yeah this needs to stop , russia is literally conquering georgia in front of the international communities eyes.that should n't be allowed in any country . 
  poor sweden , i 'm guessing the map does n't mean that swedes suddenly got interested in their own language :(, 
  montenegro is little gem , 
  this comes after a barrage of violations of both airspace and territorial waters . 
  [ here 's an article from kathimerini ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=el&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.kathimerini.gr%2f858601%2farticle%2fepikairothta%2fpolitikh%2fanhsyxia-gia-8ermo-epeisodio&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) . according to the source the fisherman was told by the coastguard ship that he was in turkish waters and was asked to follow the coastguard ship back to turkey.the fisherman then called the greek navy which drove the turkish boat out of greek waters . 
  / r/awwrthodoxbrothers :p just kidding , cheers !, 
  cyprus is `` kipurosu '' is japanese btw . 
  you have a very valid point !, 
  if they do n't belong there then yes . 
  true , giving north kosovo to serbia wo n't destabilize the region as much as kosovo 's independence did . 
  ( regarding the balkans exclusively ) there are already states to accomodate these minorities ( except roma and pomaks ) . 
  for example , how about albanians go to albania?shocking idea i know !, 
  serbia should do what if feels like is necessary if its people are threatened . 
  since kosovo is not recognised yet the train is not provocative , plus northern kosovo is serb-majority . trump 's election got everyone hyped up . 
  i think my pc broke ... just kidding , good job neighbours !, 
  blue eyes white dragon !, 
  sorry i had to, 
  fun fact : kita ( \u03ba\u03bf\u03af\u03c4\u03b1 ) means look in greek . 
  it was a joke , since sweden is struck with immigration they have a sort of national identity debate going on . 
   kurdish  swedish choose one :p, 
  obligatory fyrom comment k thnx bye, 
  me too , but since family is the most important thing for me i would n't hesitate to fight off the threat ... should it ever appear . 
  poor sweden ... 
  i liked the bulgarian and slovenian designs though . 
  as long as they are not outright killing people , i dont see anything wrong with not wanting immigrants or foreigners into their country . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , european countries were created by their people and created a political entity with a constitution to serve their people , not outsiders . 
   refugees must seek asylum in greece or italy : court ftfy, 
  mass immigration and universal fiscal policies do n't seem to work that well so i 'd say globalization is bad . 
  each country has its people and its needs . 
  not everything applies to everyone . 
  the zurich agreement was a decent solution , the junta and turkey ruined it . 
  the us and uk also hold responsibility , the us for supporting the junta and the uk for allying with turkish cypriots and their attempts for partition so they could avoid giving up the island . 
  talking about the past wo n't change anything unfortunately :(, 
  surely , but enosis could be done via a referendum , talks with the un etc. 
  not with a coup . 
  with diplomacy and international law . 
  an empty government that was appointed by a foreign power with zero diplomatic competence or regard for its people , the junta , was clearly not suited to for determining the best way to understand and take appropriate actions regarding the feelings of greeks . 
  my hypothetical scenarios are , if diplomacy succeeded and cyprus joined greece , turks would probably have minority rights like the muslim minority in western thrace . 
  if it failed , island remained as it was , and intercommunal relations determined its fate . 
   they the junta government was behind the coup . 
  not the greek people . 
  even the army staff was appointed by the colonels .
