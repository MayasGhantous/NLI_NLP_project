`` does n't hold a copy of the report '' means that the report exists . 
  is n't ` os ' and ` oc ' sound the same ?? 
  maybe on the original words it is not very similar , but the pattern is followed in derived words : \u03bf\u03c7\u03c4\u03ce \u03bd\u03c5\u03c7\u03c4\u03ce\u03c2 the general pattern of adding an `` n '' to `` eight '' and getting `` night '' seems to be followed . 
  except their ways are not democratic . 
  do n't worry , i 'm in scotland :p, 
   in my opinion you should have to learn the local language and prove you can offer something , even if its just basic willingness to work and learn new skills . 
  you realise that this is also done by many benefits-seekers , right ? 
  i feel the current situation is farcical , unethical , unfair and does not even make economic sense . 
  everybody complains about them but : 1 . 
  it is the legal residents who give jobs to the illegals . 
  they do not come `` here '' to do nothing , they come to work . 
  if `` we '' are giving work to illegals then we are equally to blame . 
  they are likely to contribute to the economy in ways better than the permanent residents , if you give them permission to work and collect taxes . 
  they come here , they work , they pay their taxes and then they leave . 
  in the meantime , portion of their taxes has been used to build infrastructure which stays behind for the locals to enjoy . 
  also , they can not claim benefits and even if they do , it would not be for long because the objective of 95 % of them is to go back and live a better life in their country . 
  even if somebody stays for ever , after paying taxes , then how is that different than having one more kid born in the population ? 
  most countries would be more than happy to occupy new lands as a means of expansion but nobody is happy to expand the population by immigration . 
  the argument that `` they take our jobs '' should more likely be `` they take the jobs that we do not want to do '' . 
  employers are happy to employ ** legal ** immigrants because they do a better job than the locals . 
  by giving them a chance in life , we help their country grow , which means that in the long run we can have more potential for exports . 
  we have most likely conquered and subsequently fucked their countries in the last millennium . 
  we killed them , exploited them and their resources , we shoved them our governments , we divided their lands the way it suited us , we created or fuelled conflicts , we still support their oppressive governments , we still lent them money at hefty interest rates , but , we do not want them here . 
  we have relied on them as cheap labour for local jobs post-wwii and those who stayed back have helped shape our cultural diversity . 
  yet we suddenly do not want them . 
  i dare any country to do a survey of how many jobs have ex-immigrants created in their country and pit it against how many illegal immigrants are working in their country right now . 
  they are generally not as many as we are being told . 
  ps : by `` we '' i mean we in europe , collectively ps2 : i live in the uk , all of the above apply for the uk and i believe for far too many other eu countries . 
  the payment was in dollars , which is ` murican and therefore ` murican law applies blah blah blah . 
  european asks : is wikipedia banned in the us ? 
  were the 0-hour contracts not in the news a couple of months ago , where they were flagged as a big way of exploiting the poor ? 
  how is it now claimed that it 's the poor 's fault ? 
  yeah , let 's abolish those and give everyone the # 1/year they deserve back !, 
  maybe i was not paying attention , 
  waitrose has more , i think . 
  we are definitely not taught philosophy on its own right at school . 
  however , we do extensively study history and ancient texts , including philosophical ones and the class always focuses on the `` meaning '' of the text . 
  we study mathematics equally vigorously . 
  this is indeed the most unsung achievement of greece . 
  people keep talking about philosophy , science and democracy but europe would be very different without this `` loose federation of city states '' . 
   at noon it was so hot that we usually made a very long nap . 
  lazy basterd . 
  gratz for the `` no '' vote yesterday btw . 
  i 'm not trolling , just i 'm not aware of these services you refer to . 
  well , i never denied that some things about the eu are weird ... 
  what services are provided to a property that are not covered by the council tax ?? 
  exactly . 
  and it is unfair to first seek expansion fiercely as possible when it suits you but then resist it when it comes back to hunt you . 
  the `` british way of life '' is another political currency . 
  so , students included in these figures then ? 
  to me it seems there is an `` eee '' sound in all the words you posted , except height and weight where the `` e '' itself is not pronounced at all ( but it is still in the devilish `` i '' ) . 
  in spanish , the `` e '' is pronounced as well [ examples ] ( http://spanish.about.com/od/spanishvocabulary/a/100-spanish-words-you-need-to-know.htm ) . 
  truth be told , i 'm probably the last person that should be discussing pronunciations ... 
  i can not think of any pronunciation of `` e '' that does not have an `` eeee '' sound in it , maybe i 'm not very imaginative . 
  however , i do admit that sometimes it may be confused with the letter `` i '' but that letter itself has an `` eee '' sound in it . 
  are you using the unicode definition to judge the similarities of 2-3 ,000 year old letters ? 
  i 'm not sure if you are confused , trolling or serious . 
  that letter : 1 . 
  comes from the same base from ancient greek 2 . 
  is pronouced almost identicaly in all languages 3 . 
  occupies the same position in the greek and latin alphabets 4 . 
  looks exactly the same in ancient greek and latin ( there was no small case in ancient greek , so the greek \u0395 is exactly the same as latin e ) 5 . 
  looks very similar even in small case \u03b5 and e differ only in a small line in the top-right corner, 
  and 4.3 m are [ students ] ( http://www.hesa.ac.uk/content/view/1897/239/ ) . 
  so , according to the census , the true non-uk born living in the uk for the long-term are less than 3m ... or 2 % if you like . 
  it 's a very good chance they do . 
  daz needz m\u00f6re \u00fcbb\u00f6atchz !, 
  i will only agree when we find out how whether it counts students in these figures . 
  what is the difference ?? 
  there are cultural/tradition factors to take into account as well . 
  in greece family ties are much stronger and you barely ever leave the family . 
  in addition , 80 % of the population lives in two big cities , so there is nowhere to go anyway . 
  it makes perfect sense to live with your parents until you get married . 
  hell , i know a number of people who own a flat but they rent it and live with their parents . 
  lol , yes . 
  bloody hell . 
  well , it is definitely not impossible but i meant that it is highly unlikely . 
  if that was the case than albania would be the only country in europe with a word for cucumber that is not shared by any other country . 
  what are the chances ? 
  greek/albanian/italian = same, 
  also , the `` kitri '' used in georgia is probably the same root as `` cetriolo '' in italy . 
  and `` hjara '' in malta is the same as the arabic `` hiyar '' but i think your colo-coding makes it look like it is the same as in italy . 
  most likely `` tranguill '' comes from the greek `` angouri '' . 
  they both have the `` angu '' sound , and it makes no sense for albania to have a word totally unique in whole europe . 
  that 's not a bad structure actually . 
  i wish reality was abiding by the spirit of this process . 
  gs is terrorising and actively beating people . 
  this is way too far than my definition of `` freedom of expression '' . 
  i like to hope its just their minute of fame . 
  maybe it does ... but who believes them ?? 
  that 's where vw genius comes in : ca n't afford a polo ? 
  buy a skoda and you get the same thing !!, 
  spot on . 
  the fiat/peugeot cars have no usp any more . 
  ( opels probably never had ), 
  for the purpose of my argument , they were . 
  that is an over-simplification and not entirely right . 
  it was the task of everyone to regulate the common currency . 
  there were some rules and help but clearly they were not enough . 
  i wish greece comes out of this in better shape and with a better mentality but i seriously doubt it .
