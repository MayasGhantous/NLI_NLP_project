  by arresting someone , you * do * deprive them of their freedom . 
  who eats aubergines raw ? 
  :o :o, 
   and exactly new policies and ideas is what the eu has been waiting for for years . 
  but so far not much seems to have happened in that regard . 
  that is why we should all , as europeans be demanding more positive things from the politicians . 
  for example , more efficiency , less bureaucracy , more transparency , less influence from the rich etc. 
   do you think it 's a good idea for greece to rely on tourism in the long run ? 
  well , tourism is the biggest part of our economy but it is only 12 % , i.e. 
  not * that * big . 
  we have lots of resources , primarily our highly-educated young people but natural resources as well . 
  i 'm sure we can find our way round , given enough shaking of the status quo . 
  i hope is crisis provides the shaking . 
   indeed , probably not . 
  what greeks often seem to not take into account is that germany ( or the eu ) ca n't force them to do anything or impose any measures on them indeed but on the other hand we can not force anyone to give us help . 
  the help is given to greece not to save greece , but to save the eurozone . 
  the other countries are not a charity , there is incentive to keep a healthy eurozone economy and a healthy greek economy , that is why we were given help . 
   well to be fair the cartoon in indeed true ( as the greeks cooked their books and therefore scammed everyone ) well , that is precisely what is not fair , you see . 
  first of all , the `` book cooking '' is realy questionable ( see the relevant [ wikipedia article and section ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_greece#eurozone_entry ) , it is well sourced ) . 
  however , even if it was entirely true , how come the whole eu be cheated by a bunch of canny greeks ? 
  the only answer is because they * wanted * to be cheated . 
  moreover , other countries have shown to be doing similar book-cooking , including france and germany ( i do n't have sources but i remember reading about these on some reddit posts ) . 
  and finally , even if book cooking happened , it was the mistake of certain people in power at the time , not the mistake of all the greeks who are receiving the wrath of the german media . 
  we have contributed to europe and the western civilisation for more than 3,000 years , even the name `` europe '' is greek . 
  how can a pitiful german tabloid magazine dare ridicule greece this way ? 
  the greeks do n't hate the germans . 
  we love germany and we have always regarded the country very highly . 
  it is just that this crisis hilights all extremism and everybody is looking for someone to blame . 
  some people are mad against the german media , others are mad against merkel , others cite the wars , others city the greek immigrants who helped on the german economic miracle etc. 
  this is a total panic situation , where nobody can become someone overnight by saying something smart against the germans or lagarde or whatever . 
  i guess the same happens in germany . 
  i hope this fades out soon when this is all over , seriously , i do . 
  i like how you started from my last point . 
  yes , in theory we 're making money but the real winner is our lenders and partners , who are having their debts paid back and who are avoiding the consequences of a greek default in respect . 
  we do n't only need more money , we need policies to help us get unstuck from traditional greek thinking . 
  a good example is exporting education ; we could be making a couple of billions p.a. 
  if we exported education to the global audience that can not afford going to expensive countries like the uk . 
  we already have lots of private colleges that do this , and they have students from the arabic countries and china . 
  it is therefore a proven market and we also have the historical backing to market it appropriately ( we 're in the eu and , of course , we 're known for science and philosophy contribution ) . 
  we 're not doing it because a small minority of 5 % does not want any change is the business model of the universities in greece because they are afraid that greeks will end up having to pay fees . 
  we need a push in situations like this but it also needs a relatively small investment ( i.e. 
  marketing ) . 
  greece should take this seriously , at government level , in the same way we take tourism . 
  speaking of tourism , i live in the uk and i barely see any advertisement for holidays in greece . 
  there used to be some in the good years but now they are all gone . 
  worse , the situation in greece has left a feeling that the country is dangerous and we 're loosing a lot of revenue from our most important export . 
  this can only be corrected with marketing and , yes , that requires money . 
  i am saying that we need more money , but most of all we need to be more competent . 
  we need someone with authority ( i.e. 
  a lender ) come with a big stick and beat us until we do things right . 
  it also has to come with appropriate communication from the politicians to the people , in all involved countries . 
  right now , the notion in the eu is that `` we gave money to greece '' and the notion in greece is `` fucking germans want to control us '' . 
  this is not going to end nicely . 
  as for the nazi caricatures , i am afraid that it all started with [ this ] ( http://www.mizozo.com/images/item_images/35000/34500_gallery.jpg ) so the blame is to all parties . 
  sadly , some journalist do not realise the long-term impact of their short-term goals . 
   no country wants germany to lead anything . 
  if this comes up even the slightest everyone goes screaming `` nazi germany is trying to take over europe again '' immediately . 
  i 'm greek and i prefer `` nazi germany '' beat the shit out of our incompetent and vote-driven politicians . 
  given the fact that all help is in form of interest-bearing loans , you 're not exactly giving away money for free , you are investing . 
  you are investing and betting that greece will come out of the recession , will repay the loan and will continue to consume germany 's products ( biggest importer in greece is germany ) . 
  in the long-term , it is the right thing to do and makes absolute sense , in the same manner that you would help a family member through some hardship . 
  in the sort term , and in order to ensure that the loan is paid back , the lenders , and primarily the germans , have pushed for a very hard austerity which has been proven to not be working in the last 2-3 years . 
  further proof that austerity is not working is also evident in the uk , despite that they engaged in quantitative easing ( printing money ) . 
  therefore everybody is crying to switch to a growth plan and provide big stimulus packages ( as the us did ) . 
  this is what soros is saying . 
  it is in the interest of everybody to think of the long term but somehow the german media and politicians have managed to turn every conventional wisdom around . 
  it is like saying that you do n't want to pay for your children 's education . 
  and just for some facts : the loan to greece comes with a 4.5 % interest , germany can borrow their share of the loan at a 1.2 % interest . 
  if greece pays back , you will be making a metric shittone of money , without spending a penny . 
  i 'd like to see the face of the manager who justified that this saving is much more significant than the bad publicity on the airline 's safety that might result from the mayday calls . 
  that article is not saying the full truth . 
  it is a fact that much of the debt that lead to the crisis was accumulated to build for the olympics , but we did not build only useless venues . 
  there was much more money paid for infrastructure that we would otherwise have little incentive to build , like the athens international airport and the amazing attiki odos and many smaller improvements here and there . 
  also , not all venues are unused , a lot of money went on the main olympic complex which is used by big football and basketball teams as well as a training ground for many other sports . 
  well , that is a big answer , thanks for that . 
  but it is late now , i will give you some more context tomorrow ( for the sake of the debate , if i do not forget it ! ), 
  oh come on , of course he did not say your thoughts exactly to make you happy . 
  you are not his/her audience . 
   `` in the event greece leaves the euro , we are prepared for the ensuing immigrant flux in such a way as to utilize the talents relevant to our industry , but no more than that '' did you read the article ? 
  this is what he said :  ** asked by keith vaz ** , the labour chairman of the house of commons home affairs select committee , whether he would restrict the rights of greek citizens to travel to britain , the prime minister said he would be prepared to trigger such powers . 
   ** `` i hope it would n't come to that , '' ** he said . 
  `` but , as i understand it , the legal powers are available if there are particular stresses and strains . 
  ** you have to plan , you have to have contingencies , ** you have to be ready for anything -- there is so much uncertainty in our world . 
  but ** i hope those things do n't become necessary . 
  ** ''  theresa may , the home secretary , confirmed last month that the government was ** examining contingency plans ** but indicated that she did not see any `` increased movement '' . 
  may told the andrew marr show on bbc1 on 10 june : '' ** so far ... we 're not seeing any trends ** in any increased movements despite obviously the significant problems already economically in a number of eurozone countries . 
  but i think it 's right that as a government across the board , ** we look at the contingency arrangements that you know might be needed in these circumstances . 
  i live in the uk for many many years . 
  i could get residency if i wanted to but there was no need to so do . 
  why is this cameron guy suddenly making me worried ? 
  no need for any connection with cyprus . 
  the majority of greeks who are now in greece and have the potential and the life experience to move to the uk are alumni of uk universities with degrees , masters and phds . 
  if they were to come here , they would come with a direct job offer , many of them via the connections the build while they were here ( e.g. 
  greeks like me who stayed here ) unskilled greek workers ( there are very few of them in the young population ) do not have to come to the uk , they will go wherever there are jobs ( definitely not the uk therefore ) cameron ca n't control shit .

  i prefer to sacrifice privacy than execute potentially innocent people . 
  also , if there is no tracking system , how will anyone prove your guild or their innocence ? 
  also , executing tax evaders ? 
  really ? 
  come on !,
