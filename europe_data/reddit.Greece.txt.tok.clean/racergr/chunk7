  well , this is the balkans , are you trying to make sense of anything ? 
  :p however , there are two real reasons for greek concern on this issue : 1 . 
  fyrom steals cultural heritage that belongs to greece and tries to benefit of this economically via tourism . 
  tourism is the only real export of greece that 's left and we have to protect it . 
  there are maps like [ this ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_il3c_pahgz0/sabd0t5wdci/aaaaaaaaauq/qlt6pcxlbwq/s400/agencies+++++++++++++++++++1ftheusa%5b1%5d_page_-393491992.jpg ) all over the `` macedonian '' national web pages on the internet . 
  what are they trying to achieve and why should we let them do it ? 
  well , i 'm happy that we both see where each-other is coming from . 
  certainly the problem can not be just in the head but certainly the problem can not be paid just by the bottom . 
  one of my wishes for this situation is that it might actually do us good and let us understand the word `` sustainability '' . 
  ( funny enough , i can not think of the greek equivalent for this word , regardless of how rich the language is ... but that must probably be just me ) by the way , the tax-free limit used to be 12k but the first bracket after that was 25 % . 
  these have all changed by now , of course . 
  tl ; dr : maybe i should have said `` the upper class '' than `` the 1 % '' first , let me apologise that i do not have time to read all your arguments but i 'll try and focus on your links . 
  secondly , let me try to defuse the situation first : http://9gag.com/gag/2681884 [ ps : i 'm not this guy ] note it says it clearly : do n't trust the media back to your links : [ 1 ] . 
  we do not have a functioning state because the politicians were employing incompetent people in exchange of votes . 
  yes , none of these incompetent people ever complained before the crisis and that is indeed our fault . 
  i wonder how can somebody estimate the `` shadow '' economy but anyway , that figure surely includes economic activity conducted by immigrants . 
  ( not that i mind them , i 'm just noticing it ) also not that the figure for the us is 9 % so it 's either there are three times more criminals in gr than the us or the authorities in the us are three times more effective than in gr . 
  now , go back to square one : incompetent public workers are employed in exchange of votes . 
  [ 3 ] oh dear , this argument again . 
  ok , let 's start by the article . 
  it says :  more than six in 10 taxpayers earn less than 12,000 euros per year and are not required to pay income taxes under the greek tax system . 
  so , i hope you do n't mean that the lowest incomes should pay taxes and i move on arguing ; it is impossible to tax-evade in greece if you are a salaried employee in a legally-operating company . 
  yes there are many companies who do n't operate legally but these are mainly smes , shops and cafes - low pay jobs - and they operate without registering or insuring their employees . 
  as you would imagine , people working there really need their job and they can not complain about the situation . 
  so , whose fault is that ? 
  the average person 's or the richer boss ? 
  another popular way to tax-evade is to own and rent property , while not declaring the income . 
  in this case the tenant is at fault for not reporting it but if they do they 'll probably be kicked off soon . 
  however , it 's not the tenant who is tax-evading so they are not in this statistic . 
  the person who is tax-evading is a certainly above average multiple property-owner who is not declaring their income . 
  so , 6/10 are tax evading . 
  how many of them can do something about it without losing their job or their tenancy and how many of them are rich compared to how many are average ? 
  my guess is : very few of the average population tax evades . 
  i appreciate that these property and sme owners are not 1 % but they are certainly above average . 
  another popular-in-the-media method to fish this statistic is by looking at the legal definition of `` tax evasion '' in greece . 
  did you know that * every * foreign tourist who has visited greece has tax-evaded ? 
  that is because : buying something without asking for a receipt is , legally , tax-evasion . 
  some media outlets took this statistic and declared greeks as tax-evaders . 
  now , let me dwell on this issue for a bit more : i strongly believe that in every large enough group of people there is a percentage of them who are criminals . 
  that percentage can not deviate too much from a bell curve . 
  therefore it is just absurd to think that 60 % of greeks are tax-evaders while it 's only 1-10 % in other countries . 
  it just happened that the media targeted greece as tax evasion heaven but what would have happened if they hard targeted the uk as a social benefit paradise or germany as a bribe-owned country ? 
  i 'll let you guess . 
  [ 4 ] we have almost no in-job or job-seeker benefits compared to other countries . 
  the worker 's rights and benefits are almost always related with retirement age and pension value . 
  yes , we 're treated better than in other countries after we retire , but we 're much worse while actively in a career . 
  also , these are measures pushed , again , by the politicians and the union leaders who keep paralysing the country with illegal strikes . 
  ( by the way , union leaders are definitely rich and highly political as well ) [ 5 ] of course , there is 30 % unemployment in greece and 50 % for the young . 
  what did you expect if there is no growth ? 
  also , like in every other european country , we have serious problems managing the ageing population but because of the hardships of the last 30-40 years we do n't have enough workers ( then children ) to cover it up . 
  this is the result of a very complicated process , it 's not fair to just flash it to me !, 
  [ 7 ] again , corruption is done by the rich . 
  why ? 
  because they get rich through corruption and they stay rich and corrupted , high-ranking public employees . 
  but again though , these are not 1 % , certainly not average though . 
  my 1 % rant was mostly against politicians and those who benefit from greece being a sleeping nation . 
  - many eu countries lied in regards with their budget deficit , inc germany and france - greece had no bank debt , only government debt which we had no problem paying until the big boys destroyed the economy . 
  the crisis effectively started in [ 2008 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_rock#subprime_mortgage_crisis_and_nationalisation ) and we were almost unaffected until late 2009 , when a private company decided to downgrade us , based on their metrics - not the eu metrics . 
  - in the meantime , greece had taken care of the eu border using our military and our resources and with no help from the eu partners for the last 30 years . 
  where is the credit for that ? 
  if you seriously believe that the country producing 2 % of total eu gdp can be responsible for * all * these consequences , then i can only say that it 's like blaming the dog for the break up of your marriage . 
  i could go on for ever but in the meantime please watch [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppjw01lerrk ) to see the other side of the coin . 
  so , greece was a disaster for the eu ? 
  nice ... 
   these proposals only adds to the growing already very big list of reasons why 'd we 'd be better off out the eu !!, 
  acta is international and many commonwealth nations ( in canada and australia ) have already signed it . 
  by assumption , if the uk was no in eu , they would have probably already signed it . 
  funny how he tries to frame everything under his agenda , even if there is no substance behind his claim . 
  he wrote to a man , who forwarded to a woman , who replied . 
   independence , or self determination is a worthy goal of it 's own . 
  of course , nobody said this is not important and a right for everyone . 
  i 'm just thinking what is the value of actually being `` declared '' independent compared to be independent in most practical matters but officially in a union . 
  also , both nations live in the same island . 
  independent or not , scotland * will * be dependent to the uk in various ways ( mostly economic dependency ) . 
  finally , do n't forget that national security is very expensive . 
  very very expensive . 
  fair point but there is a difference between seeking independence from invaders than breaking a partnership . 
  i consider the uk a partnership . 
  if you do n't like the rules of the partnership then you might go ahead and re-negotiate but independence would be unnecessary . 
  after all , both scotland and the remaining uk union would be members of both the eu and the commonwealth ( probably ) and therefore there will be a lot of common legal framework , free trade , freedom of migration etc. 
  what will scotland gain that can not be gained via other options ? 
  ( i.e. 
  as an external observer ( i 'm a foreigner who lived in the uk for 12 years , 6 in scotland and 6 in england ) , i feel the urge to warn both nations that independence is a mistake . 
  this is not a time for `` divide '' because somebody else ( europe ? ), 
  will `` conquer '' upon you ( both ) . 
  if it was the boom years , where mistakes would have a smaller impact in everyday lives then we could discuss it . 
  i think the netherlands have a similar system . 
  i have been saying this on reddit ( in other subreddits ) for years now and i 've been downvoted like hell all the time . 
  i was told things like `` greeks retire early because hairdressers retire at 45 . '', 
  even this very nice article only has 10 upvotes , nobody will ever know , everybody is poisoned by the popular media which they otherwise hate . 
  i do n't know how accurate this is , but that is a lot of potential poverty !, 
  which kinda improves my argument . 
  there is less diversity but still people like to define their origin better , when it matters . 
  i think every ethnicity thinks they are better than the other ethnicities :p, 
  hello there , i 'm greek . 
  i just want to point out that after reading the bail-out conditions , it does not feel like my country is sovereign any more . 
  i do n't mind the nationality , it is ethnicity that matters and you wo n't give this up . 
  are n't us americans able to claim that they are texan or new yorker etc ? 
  is n't their state of origin a legitimate question to a newly met person in the us ? 
  are n't scottish proud of being scottish and living in the uk ?
