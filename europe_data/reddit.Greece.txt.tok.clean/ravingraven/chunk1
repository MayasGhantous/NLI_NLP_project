with that in mind syriza winning the next greek elections is `` a problem '' . 
  podemos winning in spain , the fourth largest economy in the eurozone , could potentially be eu-shattering . 
  well , either that or it could make the eu a much better and economically-saner place . 
  both those parties are not against the eu or even the euro . 
  their election could make the ecb and germany to reconsider how the eu and the euro should look like and behave . 
  or they could go on with what they do now and see the euro fail . 
  it is just unreasonable to expect from spain and greece to go on with a plan that - in their eyes , will further destroy any hope of recouperance . 
   not the responsibility of any state , but of any ship in the area . 
  uhm ... no . 
  where did you read that ? 
  the map clearly shows the response areas for all ** countries ** in the north atlantic . 
  generally , the fir of each country is also its responsibility for sar ( in greece we even have a problem with turkey violating it and doing sar in `` our '' fir . ), 
   mare nostrum did n't take place in territorial waters , but in international waters . 
  not our responsibility . 
  lol . 
  [ you could not be more wrong . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/search_and_rescue#international_divisions_of_search_and_rescue_responsibility ) mare nostrum was a pragmatic reaction to an elevated risk of people drowning in the search and rescue area of italy . 
  it the responsibility of ** any ** state to react to ** any ** maritime distress that it reasonably can in its area . 
  in order to make those operations better and more effective , mare nostrum was created . 
  search and rescue goes far beyond territorial waters ( [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/search_and_rescue#mediaviewer/file:portuguese_search_and_rescue_area.gif ) image shows the search and rescue area of portugal for example . ), 
  this is a silly rationale which i am sure you are not using in other aspects of your life . 
  first of all what does it mean when you say `` our problem '' ? 
  if you crashed with your car and i drive past you is it `` my problem '' to call the ambulance ? 
  if i need to be at work in time or else i will get fired , does that justify me not calling the ambulance ? 
  does my smaller problem ( losing my job ) trump your bigger problem ( losing your life ) ? 
  people immigrate illegally , they set themselves in danger by doing this and that is the world we are living in ( and we europeans largely created ) and we are going to have to deal with it . 
  those are our waters those people drown in and if we elect to just look away and disobey our own maritime laws and basic ethics then that is on us and not the immigrants . 
  compared to the problems the people who are coming here face , you have zero problems . 
  i remember i was on the train the second time he escaped . 
  my friend called me to tell me something and then added : - ... oh , and paleokostas escaped again . 
  - let me guess , he used a helicopter again . 
  hahahahaha . 
  - yes ... 
  i did not believe him until i got home and watched the news ... 
  this is from an older comment of mine . 
  sorry for the length ... 
  the best documentary ever filmed is `` the mourning stone '' ( original title : '' \u0397 \u03b1\u03b3\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 '' transliterated as `` i agelastos petra '' , literally : `` the never-laughing stone '' ) by filippos koutsaftis and the world will never know because of the geographically limited release of the film and because being greek ( or having lived in greece and knowing the language ) is mandatory in understanding its full depth . 
  it is obvious that the `` greatness '' of a film is a subjective matter and that i am probably the only human that has this opinion ( even in greece most people have never even heard about the movie ) but i will try to explain why i have such a high regard of this documentary . 
  the documentary was shot in a period of about ten years , from the late eighties to the late nineties . 
  it is shot in elefsina , a small town 20 kilometers west of athens . 
  it is largely the work of just one man , filippos koutsaftis . 
  koutsaftis ( a mechanical engineer by trade and education ) worked as a principal photographer in the greek movie business . 
  originally from pelio , he would visit elefsina ( the birthplace of his wife ) periodically and he took interest in the place , its people and its past . 
  in 1988 he decided to film each time he visited . 
  elefsina is a weird place . 
  i visited it in 2007 . 
  elefsina holds the record of being the hottest place of europe , with the highest recorded temperature being 48 degrees celsius . 
  it is the hottest , ugliest , most uncomfortable place i have personally ever been too . 
  it was a very important place for the ancient greeks as it was the place where the eleusinian mysteries were held . 
  the eleusinian mysteries were rituals of initiation for those who wanted to be part of the cult of demetra and persephone . 
  people who did the initiation vowed to keep secret what happened during it with the penalty of death , something which worked rather good since , today we know very little about it . 
  what we do know is the myth of persephone which goes like this : demetra , the goddess of fertility , had a daughter , persephone . 
  one day , hades , the god of the underworld saw persephone who was very beautiful , and decided to kidnap her ( advice he got from his brother , zeus ) to the underworld and keep her there as his wife . 
  demetra searched far and wide for persephone but could not find her . 
  while searching , she abandoned all her duties as goddess and the fields stopped being fertile . 
  the people grew hungry and pleaded to zeus to bring back persephone so that the famine could stop . 
  demetra , during her search for her daughter came across a rock in elefsina , sat on it and started mourning for her daughter . 
  that rock still stands there and this is where the film takes its name from . 
  finally ( after demetra was told about the whereabouts of her daughter from helios , the sun god who saw everything ) , zeus works out a deal with hades . 
  hades can keep persephone for one half of the year and then has to return her to her mother for the other half . 
  during the half which persephone is gone , her mother weeps and nothing grows . 
  when she comes back everything blooms again . 
  this is how ancient greeks explained the seasons . 
  the area where demetra wept became of great importance for the ancient greeks who built many religious buildings there . 
  it developed into a fairly big city during roman times . 
  because of this , the area of the town is filled with ancient artifacts and ruins . 
  koutsaftis said that he started filming because he wanted to record those antiquities . 
  he was there with his camera when old houses were being demolished and in the foundations of which , countless ancient artifacts were being found . 
  pretty fast the camera also focused on the lives of those around the artifacts . 
  he started interviewing people about their time and their place . 
  just 50 years before elefsina being the hottest , ugliest , most uncomfortable place in greece it was heaven on earth . 
  it was filled with trees , hills and animals . 
  the trees were cut down , the hills were converted to cement bags and the animals fled . 
  the sea , once clean and bright , now is filled with waste from the nearby oil refinery , spotted by the container ships . 
  the people told the story that is basically the story of the corner of the world we now call greece . 
  a story in which one lives in a place which is so filled with history that it becomes irrelevant . 
  where it is such a big part of your being that it becomes disposable . 
  where you reach to the future with oil refineries and cement quarries , tourist traps and multi-level block apartment houses without looking at what you are leaving behind . 
  it shows how in most building sites , so many fragments of ancient pottery have been found that there is no time for archeologists to put them together and they are simply thrown away with the rubble . 
  there are so many sarcophagi found that the museum does not know what to do with them . 
  how , like the houses that are not being demolished , once those things belonged to a world where they were relevant . 
  in the midst of this , the camera follows panagiotis . 
  the stereotypical village crazy guy , poor and dressed in rags , who searches through the rubble to find important pieces of pottery who he then takes to the museum and that turn out to be valuable and beautiful enough to be displayed . 
  he avoids the camera and koutsaftis is most of the time running to catch up with him . 
  he dies during the time the film is shot , no one attends his funeral and when he is put to the ground during a hot summer midday it starts raining . 
  maybe he too went to a world where he is relevant . 
  girls that were kids when filming started are now getting married . 
  he films one of the last picturesque old houses getting demolished to make room for big apartment buildings . 
  the movie is shot using a handheld camera . 
  it feels almost too real , as it looks like the home videos your dad used to shoot . 
  it feels personal . 
  the faces and the stories feel like they could be your own . 
  koutsaftis narrates in a monotonous voice . 
  there is a strong sense of what the turks call `` h\u00fcz\u00fcn , '' the melancholy that is tied to a place or situation . 
  the shots are sometimes minimally dressed with music . 
  i second that !, 
  this is a classic move if you want the article to end up higher on the reddit-rank . 
  you post it . 
  if it does not get enough votes you delete and repost it ( with another name , otherwise reddit wo n't let you post ) because the older a post is , the harder it is to get to the top . 
  / u/belgiums ( a 17 days old redditor ) is probably anti-islam and wants to push this article on / r/europe ...
