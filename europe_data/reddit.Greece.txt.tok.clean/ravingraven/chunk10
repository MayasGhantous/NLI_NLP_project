  a default is always a technical default ( as it is a legal definition . ), 
  i am a greek and i do not remember such a thing happening . 
  you have a source ? 
  sure . 
  we are a nation of lazy idiots who believe that money falls from the sky . 
  greece technically never defaulted . 
  we paid or restructured all our debts . 
  there are things that need to be fixed but sch\u00e4ubles plan wo n't fix them . 
  we do more than tourism there . 
  what should happen when a westerner comes to their places and treats them like his little paradise ? 
  yeah . 
  that too . 
  i 'm no working swede but , maybe it 's because working is inherently human ? 
  i mean , why do people with immense about of wealth work ( the kind that has enough money to retire his third generation grandchildren ? ), 
  people work to feel useful/accomplish something etc. 
  not just for surviving . 
  i was an exchange student in rgbg a year ago . 
  i can tell you with certainty that loew german is not dead . 
  not dead at all ... 
  i was kidding about the eurovision constest , of course . 
  differences can be bridged , given time . 
  i do not think that i , the average young greek have unbridgeable differences between a young german or a young spaniard . 
  and yes , the erasmus program and the open borders lead to , if not cultural union , a cultural understanding . 
  those things should be self evident anyway . 
  i do n't think my opinion on this is needed to convince somebody . 
  student exchange programs , the schengen treaty , the eurovision contest ... 
   the part that did n't absolutely make sense was to use everyone 's savings for that by the cyprus government . 
  that did not make any sense at all , indeed . 
  you can let banks fail because they made mistakes when investing , but the savings accounts should be left alone . 
  i think there is a big chance that there is not * just * russian mobster money in cypriot banks . 
  and i also think that the collapse of the banking sector in cyprus will not only affect russian mobster but ordinary hard-working people as well . 
  of course , i could be wrong and its just about saving the evil russian mobsters . 
   and now all we hear from cyprus is that we have to save russian mobsters who are using cyprus as a money laundering tax haven ... well , its not that simple , is it ? 
  turn back in time . 
  change the past economy from being so dependent on banks . 
  come back to the present . 
  let the banks fail . 
  there is a lot more available to buy in greece during sundays in greece than it is in germany . 
  one of the first things that makes an impression on any greek visiting germany is how calm sundays are . 
  in greece , every neighborhood has several kiosks ( called `` peripetra '' ) that stay open until late and are open on sundays where you can buy cigarettes , newspapers snacks etc. 
  in smaller cities in germany you can literally find * nothing * open during sundays except for your occasional overpriced gas station . 
  yeah , that 's what one would think , is n't it ? 
  truth is , by now the debt is so much bigger than what greece produces that it is effectively a black hole . 
  with the current growth rate , even servicing it is a black hole . 
  that is the reason that the greek government has been calling for a haircut instead of one more extend and pretend . 
  let me go through your list , one by one :  greek trade balance is -30 bn . 
  it 's a country that imports a lot of stuff that it consumes on a daily basis . 
  and guess what happens when the government devaluates the currency by printing a truckload of money to pay off its debts ? 
  well , everything imported , from gasoline to bananas to iphones pharmaceuticals will essentially multiply in price for your average salary man . 
  this is where the real misery begins . 
  ... which is a really good way to stimulate domestic production . 
  those locally-grown fruits like peaches and plums and oranges will suddenly become much cheaper than bananas . 
  so instead of sending our money to nicaragua we can now support local farmers . 
  we will go from importing everything to only importing essential stuff that we ca n't produce ( oil and pharmaceuticals although there is a pharmaceutical factory in greece ) in a very short time . 
  tourism will also probably do very very well as everything is cheaper for tourists that come from the euro area . 
  i am not saying that it will be painless and there * will * be a 12-24 month long initial shock , but at least there will be finally light at the end of the tunnel . 
   let 's not even talk about ordinary people 's savings . 
  let 's not because there are hardly any . 
  the average greek does not have savings anymore . 
   on that thought , say you saved a lot of money for a rainy day like this one . 
  you did not . 
  no one did . 
  those who did do so sent their money abroad ages ago . 
   do n't forget about the effects this will have on income . 
  income is not the worse problem that greece faces right now . 
  the biggest problem is the lack of employment . 
  after an initial stabilization period ( as i said , probably a couple of years ) family purchasing power will probably rise even though salaries might have fallen ( because more people are now employed ) . 
   i want to stress this point . 
  creditors want the greek government to change it 's spending so that they can loan it money and believe they will get it back some day . 
  this may mean a pay cut for some sectors , less benefits for some , reining in certain costs . 
  or , you know , taxing the rich ( something which we and the troika have been avoiding like the plague ) . 
   so , you get to keep the same shitty government untouched because it can now print money instead of dealing with its issues , and your salary is now worth half as much . 
  sounds like a good deal ? 
  but if we assume that we are going to have a shitty government not matter what then our problems will always remain unsolved , euro or no euro . 
  mostly freelancers and rich people . 
  everyone calls for the reforms that would be good for them and resists those that are bad ( just like pretty much everywhere ) . 
  if greece is an example for anything it is that if you create a bad environment it is ten times as hard to correct it . 
  i am by no means an economics expert so take this with a grain of salt :  is this even possible ? 
  because currently greece has a huge budget problem . 
  this does n't really change if they are in or out of the euro ? 
  since nobody will be willing to lend any money ? 
  i am not talking about borrowing money . 
  i am talking about devaluation ( edit : i.e. 
  print more money ) . 
  while devaluation does not create wealth per se it does promote growth and exports ( and tourism ) which in turn create ( taxable ) wealth . 
  also , if we default then we do not have to pay for interest which is also money which could be fueled into the economy . 
  it is greece 's problem and the fault of those who proposed and designed the tax system , so mainly the various greek governments over the years . 
  but , also keep in mind that the latest taxes were imposed/mandated/required by the troika ( mainly the imf ) in cooperation with the previous government so they also have part of the blame . 
  fight the crisis with the standard recipe of government spending on development ( so , the opposite of austerity ) either by leaving the euro and devaluing our own coin or , inside the eurozone if the eu agrees with it and founds us ( which of course is very highly unlikely ) . 
  devaluation ( and a default ) would of course be pretty hard for the country but i think that things would normalize in a year or so . 
  fight corruption and tax evasion * first * by creating a sensible taxation system which will be guaranteed to be more or less stable for the next 5-10 years and a sensible justice system which will be able to go through cases swiftly ( also , give priority to economic offenses ) . 
  we must first create alternative for citizens that are willing to leave the current system because now there is no choice . 
  then crack down on pretty much everyone ** starting from the top ** . 
  punish anyone who tax evaded with a quick punishment that fits the extent of the evasion . 
  but you really have to start from the top as just punishing the weak in a country where everyone does not pay taxes just increases the economic gap . 
  when those two things are done ( which could easily take half a decade ) depending on your political beliefs , we could either promote private investment by simplifying the huge bureaucracy that is involved in creating and running a business ( and make your public sector work * for * and not * against * us ) which is * all * it takes as greeks are highly educated , work hard and have good infrastructure compared to other players in the region . 
  or we can let the state invest in even better infrastructure ( rail , ports ) and raw materials industry ( bauxite , lumber ) to actually create another source of generating imported revenue except for tourism ( where there is also big room for improvement ) . 
   i literally have to buy a new software every year ... really ? 
  me too !, 
  and , god do i feel ** lucky ** that the german tax system is simple enough so that software can do your taxes for you .
