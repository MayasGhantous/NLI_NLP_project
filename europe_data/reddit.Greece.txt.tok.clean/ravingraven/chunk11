  in greece the tax system is so complicated that there is no software for you if own even a small business . 
  you pretty much have to hire a tax-specialist . 
  also keep in mind that i am not even talking about complexity here . 
  i am talking about uncertainty . 
  greeks * literally * do not know what they are going to pay for taxes next year . 
  no one knows what the tax system is going to look like in a few months from now . 
  let 's say you have a house and you must decide what to do with it . 
  are there going to be higher property taxes next year ? 
  lower ? 
  is there going to be a tax that does not apply to your house ? 
  no one knows . 
  with the enfia tax we went from zero taxes on your main residence to up to 500-1000 euro per year for a 100 sq. 
  m. residence with only 2-3 months of warning . 
   please if you live in germany you should know just how fucked up and twisted our tax system is . 
  the german tax system is a leisurely walk in the park compared to the greek one . 
  first and foremost , in germany you know how much tax you will have to pay , years in advance . 
  in greece the system changes literally every year for years now . 
   yet our government manages to atleast collect them . 
  you can not collect money that is not there !, 
  those projected tax revenues are from taxes that businesses have to pay ** in advance ** according to what your revenue was last year . 
  say you made 100.000 in 2015 and paid 30.000 in tax . 
  you will also have to pay like 15.000 ** now ** for next year . 
  the problem is , the economy tanked and you do n't have 15.000 . 
  this money simply does not exist for someone to collect it . 
  it is not a collection issue . 
  it 's a taxation system issue . 
  the thing is , there are very few people with bitcoins in greece so , even if very few new people buy them it 's going to look like a huge increase percentage wise . 
  1 is 10 % of 10 but 1 % of 100 . 
  itt : people who have no idea what is happening in greece . 
  those taxes go uncollected mainly because those who got taxed do not have the money to pay them . 
  the reason ? 
  since a few years ago greece collects huge taxes on houses and apartments that do not generate any revenue ( are not occupied , are the main residence of the owner etc. ), 
  and businesses have to pay a fraction of * next * year 's tax in advance . 
  why not just call a spade a spade ? 
  the referendum is not for the euro because it is not in the hands of the greek people if they are going to stay in the euro . 
  if greeks vote `` yes '' then they will be ( probably ) * allowed * by { the commission | the ecb | merkel | the illuminati } to stay in the euro ( at least till the next hurdle comes along ) . 
  and yours does not account for the number of people that work . 
  all statistics are approximations . 
  you are looking at the wrong thing . 
  you should be looking at [ labour compensation per hour worked ] ( https://data.oecd.org/chart/4jgm ) . 
  the biggest problem in greece is not visible if you are just looking at the average wage drop . 
  the biggest problem is unemployment . 
  people should be looking at the drop of household income instead of wages . 
  the average salary might `` just '' have dropped around 15-30 % ( depending on the sector ) during the crisis but pre-crisis there were two or three people working in a household and now there is one ( and this one person is making 15-30 % less ) . 
  this is a huge drop in income and the main reason that mortgages are being restructured or not being paid at all .

  [ read this . 
  ] ( http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/id/10314.pdf )  while job losses involved an unusually high number of workers , loss of earnings for those still in employment was also significant . 
  average real gross earnings for employees have lost more ground since the onset of the crisis than they gained in the nine years before that . 
  those were complex times . 
  i highly recommend reading the wikileaks documents of that period . 
  karamanlis did not get along with the american embassy because ( allegedly ) they were spying on him . 
  but it is beyond silly to call him a russophile . 
  bull . 
  shit . 
  you keep using the word `` russophile '' a lot . 
  no one in power in greece in the last 30 years was a `` russophile '' . 
  samaras did nothing to apease the russians ( he even went along with the sactions that damaged our exports and tourism in a very very difficult time just fine ) . 
  karamanlis did almost nothing to apease the russians ( an oil pipe plan that came to naught ) . 
  all our military equipment with the exception of a part of the air defence ( s-300 ) is either european or american . 
  we have american bases on our soil and are a member of nato , nothing of which anyone of the people you mentioned did anything against . 
  syriza is in fact the only goverment in a long time to have made any meaningful gestures towards the russians and even that might turn out to be just a bluff . 
  the mitsotakis family are no angels . 
  the only reason that they did not govern a longer time is because they are greedy and arrogant . 
  mitsotakis could have been priminister a lot sooner and long had he not taken part in the apostasia . 
  his daughter shot herself in the foot when she left the party . 
  his son shot himself in the foot when he played the role of the `` bad '' guy for the samaras goverment . 
  both of them were very involved in the siemens scandal that propably tainted them for life . 
  greeks give as many fucks as germans would in a similar environment . 
  we are all human ... 
  source : went to primary school in germany , highschool and university in greece , exchange student in germany , worked in greece and now am working in germany . 
  greece : pretty much no stigma . 
  highest smoking rate in the eu ( something like 40-50 % , you guys have nothing on us ) . 
  teachers smoke on the yard during recesses ( which is an improvement , when i was in school they smoked in the buildings ) . 
  people smoke in bars and restaurants , no problem . 
  there is a no-smoking law but noone gives a fuck and it is very very loosely enforced . 
  the crisis started in 2009 . 
  that was six years ago . 
  i think that if we defaulted back then , things ** now ** would be better or at least have a better outlook than they have now . 
   without money from europe things would 've gone worse in greece . 
  i disagree with that . 
  i do n't think that a default and a grexit would have been worse than what is happening right now . 
  i would hardy call what is going on in greece today as a `` benefit '' . 
  `` greece agreed to it '' would be a better description . 
   european tax payers took on hundreds of billions of toxic greek debt when nobody else would ... ... mostly to save their own banks and the euro . 
  there is a thing called [ `` forensic accounting '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forensic_accounting ) . 
  they use it if they want to make sure that you do n't tax evade . 
  simply applying [ benford 's law ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/benford%27s_law ) in the case of greece would have easily shown that the numbers were cooked ( [ which is something that someone eventually did ] ( http://www.badscience.net/2011/09/benfords-law-using-stats-to-bust-an-entire-nation-for-naughtiness/ ) ) . 
  on top of that , i was a kid when greece joined the eurozone and i vividly remember my dad and his friends having conversations about how the numbers were cooked . 
  i mean , if a kid in greece knows about the cooked numbers people in brussels knew as well ... 
   they bailed out cyprus banks with close to no domino effect . 
  [ well , the washington post ( and everyone else ) disagrees with you ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/03/18/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-cyprus-bailout-in-one-faq-2/ ) . 
   the worst-case scenario under a plan with a haircut is that the plan triggers a run on banks not just in cyprus ( that appears to already be happening ) but in other vulnerable countries like spain and italy as customers worry that the e.u. 
  will try to impose similar conditions there also , the cyprus bailout was partly founded by savings accounts . 
   so point disproved . 
  even if that was not the case in cyprus ( which it totally was ) that does not prove that it was not the case in greece . 
  [ again , the media disagree with you . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/8578337/the-countries-most-exposed-to-greek-debt.html )  and in 2011 all greek ppl . 
  had money in their accounts . 
  sure , * some * people did .
