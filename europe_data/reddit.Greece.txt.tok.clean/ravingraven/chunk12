  [ but capital flight has been steady since the first day of the crisis ] ( http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/edbfc18c-4268-11df-8c60-00144feabdc0.html ) . 
  most poor people ( the ones that were by far the most hard hit from the crisis ) did not have any savings after late 2010 . 
  wealth in greece is `` stored '' as real estate which is what actually got taxed and that is why we did not see a cyprus scenario in greece . 
   ... thats the whole point to bail out any bank ... stop probable domino effects . 
  and any bank has and should have debts at other banks . 
  who are you arguing with ? 
  did i ever write the contrary ? 
   the greek banks were bailed out for that reason ... to stop them from collapsing . 
  again , you are arguing with yourself . 
   and again : a collapsing bank takes any account owners with it ... all the savers ... all the `` normal '' ppl . 
  this is a purely theoretical argument now . 
  because : * you could choose to bail out the savers instead ( and * that * would have been free money ) . 
  * greece at this point pretty much has no savers . 
  everyone who has money does not keep it in greece . 
  my argument is that the bailout money to the greek banks came so that the greek banks do not collapse ** and ** lead to a french or german collapse as well . 
  if the exposure to greeks banks was smaller then the e.u. 
  would not have cared about them . 
  those 45 billion were given to protect french and german banks . 
  yes , but : greek banks were bailed out mainly to protect german and french banks ( to which they owed money to ) . 
  it was thought back then that greek banks defaulting would lead to a domino effect .

   i disagree with pretty much anything here that 's not strictly factual . 
  what did you not find `` strictly factual '' ? 
  ok , here we go :  since it is the prime minister that set up the committee and the deputy finance minister making those claims it seems genuine and serious and not just a couple of backbenchers looking for a topic to grandstand on . 
  yes , it appears to be government policy to bring those things up . 
   they sure understand that germany wo n't pay them 279 billion euros , not even a fraction of that . 
  yes . 
  the chances of germany paying the 279 billion are pretty much the same as greece paying its 320 billion euro debt . 
  can you see a pattern ? 
  it 's all politics . 
  those numbers are so big that they are pretty much meaningless . 
   they surely understand that stances like those are devoured by the tabloid press and will make it so much harder for german politicians to make concession ? 
  uhm . 
  i ca n't remember german politicians making any concessions while the previous government did everything it could to * not * bring up issues like this . 
  for the average greek this does not make any difference . 
   why do they spend so much time and effort vilifying germany ? 
  because a lot of people ( me included ) actually do believe that germany is acting in an evil way ( for various reasons ) . 
   would they like to negotiate bailouts with finland , a nation with a much harder stance ? 
  that is a purely theoretical question ( it will never happen ) because at this point germany = europe as far as negotiations go . 
   i would think that they understand that the european project is in part paying reparations in many different forms to help develop less fortunate nations ? 
  greeks being on the receiving end of those `` reparations '' ( commonly called support or stability packages ) know that this is * not * the case . 
  those packages existed to shape the european economy i.e. 
  the fact that the eu spend money in greece did not mean that other countries did not benefit from it . 
  they were more investments than anything else . 
   what 's the point ? 
  surely the greek electorate knows all that as well . 
  how do the greek people feel about this ? 
  this is what greeks ( who voted for the current government , not me ) feel about this : at the beginning of the crisis , the troika * actively * stepped in and offered a solution in the form of a bailout . 
  it was understood ( in retrospect , from how the current government is being treated by the troika but also back then , from for example how papandreou 's proposal for a referendum was received by the other european leaders ) that we either had to keep 100 % in line or we would not be bailed out . 
  the line was austerity and `` the banks first '' ( mainly because french and german banks were exposed to greek bonds and a default could throw the european banking sector out of balance ) , something which pretty much everyone now ( either silently or publicly ) acknowledges did not work ( for greece , the banks did just fine ) , like , * at all * . 
  greece followed the line by voting in two pro-troika governments during the 2009-2015 period . 
  2015-2009 = six years . 
  greeks think that any bad effects from a bailout would probably not last longer than six years and that even if the low was lower that what was experienced during those six years ( which was really really low ) they at least now would have started to recover ( which is in no way happening now , look at the unemployment numbers ) . 
  to cut a long story short : greece went through a six year long tunnel and the only thing that it has to show for it are the bank bailouts . 
  lowering wages did not bring investors and cutting down the public sector did not create surpluses . 
  so , greeks do not see germany as a partner that is there to help anymore , but as a country that just follows its own agenda . 
  that means that everything is fair game now . 
  germany throws at us everything it has to better its position so we might as well do the same thing . 
  things stopped being `` ethical '' and `` fair '' a long long time ago . 
  edit : the downvote is not a disagree button . 
  if you have an opinion , write it down !, 
  there are a lot of people in greece that still view the turks with animosity . 
  hostile turkish-greek relations are not something of the past and things look like they are getting a bit worse with the new government . 
  there are still a lot of open issues ( like the [ aegean dispute ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aegean_dispute ) , the [ halki seminary ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/halki_seminary ) and of course cyprus ) which a lot of ( especially older generation ) greeks still find very important . 
  in addition to that , greeks partially blame the turkish government for the huge immigration waves of the past decade ( i.e. 
  that the turkish government willingly lets immigrants pass through turkey without any controls ) . 
  on the other hand , there is an obvious cultural connection between the two countries . 
  greeks are more alike to turks than any other of their non-greek speaking neighbors in my opinion . 
  there is quite a lot of tourism between the two countries , thessaloniki being an important ( birthplace of ataturk ) and easily accessible city for the turks and istanbul being being an important and easily accessible city for the greeks . 
   how would someone react to a greek learning turkish and vice versa ? 
  in greece this would mostly meet a positive reaction . 
  first of all , there are and were a lot of greeks that spoke turkish as a native language . 
  greek nationals in [ thrace ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muslim_minority_of_greece ) as well as older generation pontic greeks grew up speaking turkish . 
  greece has a lot of turkish loanwords ( like most balkan countries ) and friends of mine who learned turkish told me that it is surprisingly easy to learn . 
  nope . 
  that is more or less what it takes ( maybe flicking a switch to deactivate the flight computer as well ) . 
  i actually looked into what electrical failoure might look like and found [ this ] ( http://www.aaib.gov.uk/cms_resources.cfm?file=/2-2008%20g-euob.pdf ) about an a319 . 
  the synopsis is very interesting :  the incident occurred at 1926 hrs on 22 october 2005 , to an airbus a319-131 aircraft which was operating a scheduled passenger flight between london heathrow and budapest . 
  the following inspectors participated in the investigation : mr a p simmons investigator-in-charge ms g m dean operations mr r g ross engineering mr p wivell flight recorders as the aircraft climbed to flight level ( fl ) 200 in night visual meteorological conditions ( vmc ) with autopilot and autothrust engaged , there was a major electrical failure . 
  this resulted in the loss or degradation of a number of important aircraft systems . 
  the crew reported that both the commander 's and co-pilot 's primary flight displays ( pfd ) and navigation displays ( nd ) went blank , as did the upper ecam1 display . 
  the autopilot and autothrust systems disconnected , the vhf radio and intercom were inoperative and most of the cockpit lighting went off . 
  there were several other more minor concurrent failures . 
  the commander maintained control of the aircraft , flying by reference to the visible night horizon and the standby instruments , which were difficult to see in the poor light . 
  the co\u2011pilot carried out the abnormal checklist actions which appeared on the lower ecam display ; the only available electronic flight display . 
  most of the affected systems were restored after approximately 90 seconds , when the co-pilot selected the ac essential feed switch to alternate ( ` altn ' ) . 
  there were no injuries to any of the 76 passengers or 6 crew . 
  after the event , and following discussions between the crew and the operator 's maintenance control , the aircraft continued to budapest . 
  so , you were actually right about displays turning off during an electrical failure . 
  the vhf radio also turned off in this case ( but there is a backup that is powered by a dc bus ) . 
   this was a very early a32x series so it had a very basic set up backup instruments ( artificial horizon , altimeter , asi and a magnetic compass ) not the more sophisticated digital one fitted to later models . 
  first of all , the asi is the artificial horizon ( and it is called a standby attitude indicator on the a320 ) . 
  all a320s also have a digital distance radio magnetic indicator right below the sai which can display adf and vor directions and dme distances . 
   in the event of an electrical failure the a320 's computers will go into mechanical backup , there will only be rudder , pitch ( through the trip wheel ) and thats it . 
  in the event of a ** complete loss ** of electrical ** flight control signals ** ( which does not necessarily mean `` electrical failure '' or even `` complete electrical failure '' ) the a320 's computers will go into mechanical backup . 
  i do n't think that that was the case solely because there was communication between the aircraft and atc which means that at least * some * things were working . 
  it is weird , yes . 
  i can think of no reason to willingly keep flying towards that direction ( that does not of course mean that there * is * no reason ) . 
  i disagree with the reply from / u/ewanwhosearmy .
