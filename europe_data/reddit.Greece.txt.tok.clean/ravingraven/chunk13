  first of all , any aircraft ( not just a320s ) is designed to be flyworthy ( including navigation ) without any crts . 
  ndbs and vor receivers are operational in the event of an electrical failure and the pilots probably had plenty of time to use them to figure out where they are . 
  ~ ~ in addition to that : the nd1 and mcdu1 would crts go out only if the airspeed would drop below 125 knots or the landing gear would be deployed ( those are the conditions at which the ram-air turbine would stop producing ac to power them ) . 
  the facts do not indicate that something like this has happened . ~ ~ edit : looks like nd1 and mcdu1 actually do go off in the event of an electrical failure . 
  and : since the pilots had communication with atc they could simply ask where they are . 
  flying the airplane is priority number one ( even before declaring an emergency ) and knowing where you are is a big part of flying the airplane . 
  germanwings pilots fly solely within europe and this is probably not the first time that the crew did this flight . 
  i think they knew ( at least more or less ) where they were even if everything else went wrong . 
  just to add some perspective : according to [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/b6q5tsz.jpg ) the aircraft lost around 30.000 feet in about 8-9 minutes pretty linearly ( except for a shudden drop at the top ) . 
  that amounts to a descent rate of a bit less than 4000 feet per minute . 
  that is fast ( faster than what you would experience during a `` normal '' flight ) but not `` extremely '' fast . 
  for example , [ during a controlled emergency descent , an air france a320 had an average descent rate of 5400 feet per minute ] ( http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:yo1kgj4grqsj:avherald.com/h%3farticle%3d457272ac+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk ) . 
  in addition to that , emergency descents normally stop at 10.000 feet . 
  what looks worrisome is the speed . 
  what is indicated on the chart is the aircraft 's ground speed ( i.e. 
  how fast the aircraft moves relative to the ground ) . 
  a ground speed of 430 knots is normal when the aircraft is at 37.000 feet as the air at such altitudes is a lot thinner . 
  a ground speed of 380 knots under 10.000 is a lot higher than normal though . 
  although i doubt that such a speed would create any structural damage , it is still well above `` normal '' and a clear indicator that something is seriously wrong . 
  ** what follows is wild armchair-pilot conjecture , made way too prematurely and should only be treated as such : ** it kind of looks like that the aircraft was more or less under control but the pilots were unable/decided against using the spoilers ( something that would have happened if the aircraft was performing an emergency descent ) to keep the speed at the mmo ( 350 knots ) . 
  it is also possible that not all three hydraulics systems were available . 
  each hydraulic circuit controls a set of spoilers , blue controls spoilers 3 , green controls 1 and 5 and yellow controls 2 and 4 . 
  it might be possible that one or more hydraulic systems were gone which would render a subset of the available spoilers not usable . 
  it would be interesting to see what the maximal descent rate is if only a subset of the spoilers is operational ( i might try it out later in fsx ) . 
  another question is why the aircraft kept on flying straight ahead . 
  nice , toulon and marseille all have airports that are well equipped to handle emergencies and would be an obvious choice for an emergency landing . 
  even ditching in the mediterranean looks like a better option than the mountains . 
  yet the aircraft kept on flying straight ahead into the alps , just blindly crashing into them ... edit : ~ ~ everyone is thinking it , i am going to say it : this looks suspiciously like a highjacking . 
  i mean , this is how a highjacking would * look like * . 
  again : this is based on pretty much zero amount of facts and data . 
  if you want useful and reliable information about the incident , please wait for the authorities to make a statement ! ~ ~ statements seem to confirm that that is not the case . 
  i would not compare a mcd cheeseburger with normal burgers , not because of the quality but because it is a different thing . 
  normal burgers are closer to a mcd simmentaler . 
  it was just an example . 
  there are other ( a bit cheaper ) alternatives in the center . 
  your comparison is bullshit . 
  a similar thing in mcd ( lets say a simmentaler menu ) would have cost around 7 euro + 2.40 to get another water to match the 0.75 l that the heroes water is . 
  so , around 9.50 compared to 14 . 
  and the things do n't even * remotely * compare quality wise . 
  you wrote :  in germany it is quiet hard to find a `` no name '' burger place ... no , it is n't . 
   ... and if you find one , it 's extremely expensive . 
  again , it is n't . 
  you can get amazing restaurant burgers for a bit more than what you would pay for a mcd menu in frankfurt ( for example in heroes ) . 
  edit : some people obviously ca n't read , so here is an idiot-proof explanation of what i said :  you can get amazing restaurant burgers ... mcd burgers are not amazing . 
  heroes burgers are ( whoever ate there can attest to that ) . 
  i am not comparing apples with apples here . 
   ... for a bit more ... 
  yes , restaurant burgers are more expensive than mcd burgers so if you actually made an effort to * read * my ** two ** lines long comment you would have understood the redundancy of your `` hurr durr mcd cheeseburger is just a euro yo '' comment . 
   ... than what you would pay for a mcd menu in frankfurt because only a mcd ** menu ** is comparable to what you would normally order in a restaurant . 
   ... ( for example in heroes ) . 
  note the word ** `` example '' ** . 
  there * are * other burger places ( possibly a lot cheaper or better ) than heroes . 
  heroes was just what came to mind when i posted this . 
  i still do n't get who the byzantines occupied ... those people there were romans and became byzantines . 
  did you delete your comment just to repost it ? 
  lol at least take the downvotes that your opinion generated like a man . 
   besides , one can not be serious thinking that letting these people roaming the streets is a solution . 
  * these people * . 
  * roaming the streets . 
  * really ? 
  i mean , ok , i get it . 
  our opinions differ . 
  but ca n't you at least * try * not to sound like a racist ? 
  now , about the matter at hand . 
  we are obligated that we treat `` these people '' humanely until their situation is resolved . 
  i am surprised i even have to explain something that basic , but : their basic human rights trump our racist desire not to let them `` roam the streets '' . 
  the state is supposed to treat ** everyone ** humanely . 
  be it citizens , immigrants or child rapists . 
  i really do n't get how people think that people in greece would go apeshit about that ... 
  it actually makes very very much sense . 
   in addition to a plan that would grant citizenship to second-generation migrants born ** and raised ** in greece ... 
  so , you are born in greece ( to parents who came here illegally ) , go to school here ( that is meant with `` raised '' ) and then you get your citizenship . 
  this is ** a lot ** less extreme than what countires with jus soli do ( like the us or france ) . 
   ... the new immigration ministry has also proposed shutting down immigrant detention centres . 
  greek immigrant detention centres are a hell-holes . 
  `` housing '' people there ( besides breaking several human rights laws ) is a national disgrace . 
  this is ** not ** the case . 
  the article ( and the proposed reform ) read :  in addition to a plan that would grant citizenship to second-generation migrants born ** and raised ** in greece , the new immigration ministry has also proposed shutting down immigrant detention centres . 
  children born in greek soil will not be automatically considered greek citizens ( jus soli ) . 
  the ragousis law for example would have given the greek nationality to people that finished the mandatory education in the greek school system ( and were not nessecarily born in greece ) . 
   structure of the euro and private sector gorging on credit was the impetus . 
  we do not disagree as much as you make it out that we do . 
   the current account deterioration in 2008 combined with already 100 % debt/gdp ratio gave little room for maneuver . 
  i guess that my main point on that is that better planning and action during the `` good '' decade ( 1995-2005 ) would have mitigated the crisis . 
  you might be right that in the years immediately before 2008 , not much could have been done ...  karamanlis was warned by the americans that the crisis will wash up on his shores ( per the wikileaks cable dumps ) but he ignored them . 
  yes . 
   so in 2007 they could have started to take steps , but karamanlis and then papandreou did the opposite . 
  yes . 
  that does not absolve anyone governing before 2007 . 
  i see the karamanlis and papandreou governments qualitatively as a continuation of the all the previous governments since 1992 . 
  i do n't think that you can draw a line at 2007 . 
   with 20/20 hindsight ( knowing what has happened since 2009 ) you can say they should have been more responsible . 
  the better part of the greek left ( including me ) were shouting during the `` good days '' . 
  not everyone was silent or content back then ...  how irresponsible were they ? 
  a lot . 
   the greeks got the idea of goldman sachs currency swaps from italy , for instance . 
  `` everyone is doing it '' does not justify mistakes . 
  it just explains them . 
   seems to me they were exuberantly optimistic that the good ol days of growth would go on for decades . 
  thus they should just keep an eye on debt/gdp and it 's all good .
