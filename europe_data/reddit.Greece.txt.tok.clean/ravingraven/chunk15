   frequently frequently ? 
  no , not frequently . 
  trains in germany are ridiculously safe . 
  5.5 * million * persons and 600 thousand tons of freight travel daily by rail on around 44 thousand trains . 
  again , those are ** daily ** figures . 
  the `` deaths per billion-travel-kilometers '' rate for rail in germany is around 0.08 compared to 1.6 for the autobahn . 
  that is a two orders-of-magnitude difference and can only be compared with the fatality rate for air travel ( in fact , it is about the same ) . 
  you ca n't legally get in or out of greece without an id . 
   i want to see how greece and spain do it and then we 'll talk who is right or not . 
  we already clarified who is right and who is wrong . 
  all left ideas * can * be implemented without authoritarianism . 
  what greece and spain does is irrelevant . 
  the argument is about if it * can * be done and not if it * will * be done . 
   ... i do n't see that happening without authoritarianism because those ideas are not that popular in western countries ... that statement differs a lot from your original one . 
  it also totally disregards the recent election results from spain and to some extent , greece . 
   but you should also know that in a modern democracy the will of the majority is not everything , it needs to follow some precepts , otherwise you might get the majority decide that it 's a good idea to segregate people of different race , it 's a good idea to discriminate based on religion , and so on . 
  that might be the case , but that is no authoritarianism . 
  also , we are not discussing whether or not socialism is a good thing but whether socialism can be instated by a non-authoritarian government . 
   so let 's say the majority of people might decide to confiscate trump 's wealth , it wo n't happen because people have rights recognized by constitution and laws . 
  constitutions and laws change . 
  democracy means that the collective decides what is happening . 
  there is a very real possibility that bad things * can * result from democratic processes but we are not arguing about that . 
  you said : * you can not implement most of the left ideas without authoritarianism . 
  * which is a clearly * wrong * statement . 
  you can . 
  that some people/trump/you * in particular * might find those left ideas wrong/unjust etc. 
  is besides the point . 
  democratic change which is not in someones favour is ** not ** authoritarianism . 
   you can not implement most of the left ideas without authoritarianism . 
  it is not authoritarianism if it is a law instated by a democratically elected government enjoying popular support , enforced by an independent ( police ) force and judged by an independent judiciary system . 
  otherwise , you could just as easily claim that speed limits are authoritarianism . 
  if we collectively agree that individuals are not allowed to own means of production then we collectively agree that we do not want to have capitalism . 
  if those individuals that do own means of production disagree with the collective , too bad for them , that is how democracy works . 
  ok , march is two months away . 
  let 's see if they scrap anything ( protip : do n't hold your breath , even if they do , out wo n't be in favour of greece ) . 
  so , if germany changes it 's stance on an issue , any issue ; do you really believe that the majority of the eu states will not follow ? 
  and another thing : can you name the last time that eu policy did not align with what germany wanted at the time ? 
  just look at immigration : germany : `` we do n't really wa n't immigrants . '', 
  germany : `` we do want immigrants . '', 
  eu : `` forget about dublin ii , let them pass ! '', 
  germnay : `` nope , changed our minds again . 
  no immigrants please . '', 
   ehm it was germany which floated the idea ... whatever the germans say , the eu says . 
  it has been this way for over half a decade now ... 
  fair enough . 
  even though having a very long coastline does not make it easier . 
  to border is not trivially small either . 
   meanwhile , he never traveled a single time to ankara to discuss the crisis hitting his people on the greek islands . 
  you know what is worse than being an idiot who lives on his own little planet ? 
  being an * uninformed * idiot who lives on his own little planet . 
  [ greek pm tsipras makes rare visit to turkey over migrant crisis ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/greek-pm-tsipras-makes-rare-visit-to-turkey-over-migrant-crisis/a-18857805 ) date 18.11.2015 the fact that your moronic comment at the top of this chain has so many upvotes really says a lot about the state of / r/europe . 
  i do n't understand why you do n't like to be called a racist when you clearly are one . 
  nazis did not have a problem being called nazis . 
  neo right-wingers are weird ... 
  you people really live in some other planet . 
  there are * literally * tens of thousands of immigrants crossing each month . 
  if we were to put them in prison ( which is very very unethical , not everyone is as racist as you ) we would need to build around 10 prisons per day . 
  idiots ... 
   i am not arguing that it is easy . 
  i am arguing that the greek government does not want to do it for free . 
  you * are * arguing that it is easy . 
  you said :  if the greek government wanted to police their borders , greek governemnt would police their borders . 
  if it 's that easy then , how ? 
   i personally think that every last one of them should be rescued and then shipped back to their port of origin . 
  where ? 
  back to turkey ? 
  how would that be possible ? 
  turkey wo n't take them . 
  put them in a canon and fire them there ? 
  lol you are really bad at writing bullshit . 
   the point beeing that in the face of great danger for their populations , poorer government than greece , some in a state of civil war were able to effectively shut their borders to contain the risk . 
  the ivory coast just shut down ** border crossings , ports and airports ** . 
  you could easily cross from the ocean or from the unprotected land border . 
  greece has very well protected border crossings , ports and airports . 
  it 's the ** tens of thousands of kilometers of coastline ** ( yes , greece has 13.676 km worth of coastline , the ivory coast has just 515 km , that is just the coastline length of one or two islands in greece ) that are a problem . 
  also , it 's not the * crossing * that is the problem in greece but the fact that there are people in the water and someone has to rescue them . 
  imagine the following : you are an officer in a patrol boat . 
  you see a boat full of immigrants coming in from turkey ( which is not hard to do , they cross during the day and all wear bright orange vests ) . 
  you call the turkish coast guard ( which merkel gave money to to stop the situation ) . 
  they do n't give a fuck . 
  the boat keeps approaching . 
  you call out on the megaphone for them to not cross the border . 
  they do n't give a fuck . 
  what do you do ? 
  do you shoot ? 
  congratulations , you are now on the news for killing innocent immigrant kids . 
  do you not shoot ? 
  the moment the boat passes the border , the captain sinks it . 
  it is now your responsibility to rescue them . 
  do you not rescue them ? 
  congratulations , you are now on the news for letting innocent immigrant kids die . 
  do you rescue them ? 
  they are now on greek soil and must be processed according to the law . 
  `` poor '' in not just an economic term . 
  social factors come into play ( like marginalization and lack of education ) of which immigrants suffer even more than non-immigrant poor people . 
  my point : there is nothing special about being syrian or a muslim . 
  the real cause is poverty ( lack of economic founds , marginalization , lack of education etc. ) . 
  a dane in the same circumstances would do the same . 
  timothy 2:12, 
   it just so happens islam directly theologically teaches such behaviour towards women and decrees violence directly .
