   how can someone who obviously tries to be leftist not recognise the fascism in islam is beyond me . 
  if i was to treat other people ( especially the ones who are poorer or weaker than me ) according to what their religion teaches i would have to drop a nuclear bomb and kill a big majority of the population . 
  almost all western religions ( including christianity ) teach some things that are abhorrent . 
  i treat people as people . 
  what is really happening is that you are trying to project * your * racism towards immigrants from north africa and the middle east on the shortcomings of some kind of dogma . 
  why do n't you do the same for your fellow christian neighbors ? 
  there are plenty of misogynistic things written in the bible as well . 
   how can someone who obviously tries to be leftist not recognise the fascism in islam is beyond me . 
  there is just as much fascism in islam as there is in any religion . 
  i dislike them all equally . 
   you are so blinded by your desire to appear `` humane '' and have all immigrants as allies in your struggle against the right-wing , that you fail to see the very , very far-right , conservative proto-fascism within islam as an ideology and all those muslims , who are more than passive members of the community , but active practitioners of the religion . 
  i am so far left to see that * all * religions are bullshit and what actually is different is the socioeconomic status of the people practicing it . 
  rich , educated , free christians do not differ from rich , educated , free muslims . 
  you can be racist towards ethnically different people . 
   racism consists of ideologies and practices that seek to justify , or cause , the unequal distribution of privileges or rights among groups that are conceptualized as racially or * ethnically * different . 
  the right wingers that are on the rise in europe today are not * just * islamophobes , they are racists . 
  the reason : * christian * immigrants from syria , egypt etc. 
  ( of which there are many ) are treated exactly the same as their muslim compatriots . 
  i doubt that the guy i replied to ( who is from bulgaria ) has any problem with [ bulgarian muslims ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulgarian_muslims ) ( of which , again , there are many ) . 
  it is syrians and north-africans that he hates and discriminates against . 
  not just muslims . 
  first of , nice kettle logic . 
  if you look at the [ stats ] ( http://anon-ftp.iza.org/dp1551.pdf ) you will see that immigrants are up to 3 times more likely to be poor than the general population ( which still contains immigrants ) . 
  i could not find stats for the poorest people of denmark but i am sure that there are overwhelmingly many immigrants at the bottom . 
   and even when its adjusted for socio economic status , they still commit more crimes . 
  source ? 
   you might think you are social-oriented and left wing person , but what you just wrote is horribly discriminatory and prejudicial towards precisely the poor . 
  it is based on fact :  ** poverty causes crime **  in the countries where the social discrimination factor is n't very strong , results have shown that less education meant more criminal offenses ranging from property crime to `` casual '' theft and drug-related offenses ( again , mostly theft ) . 
  but not violence . 
  it appears that in fact , poverty itself is more tied with violence , criminal damage and also drug use - as a catalyst for violence . 
  http://www.poverties.org/poverty-and-crime.html  no , being poor does not , in any way , make someone more accepting towards rape . 
  i never talked about acceptance . 
  just about the measured fact that poor people commit more crime . 
  i would like to note that i myself come from a combined poor and immigrant background . 
   and far more often punished by the people of that community themselves . 
  because the average poor community of europeans does n't see unveiled , liberal women as `` worthless prostitutes '' , the way islamic communities do . 
  now * that * is a disgusting and racist thing to say . 
   30 % of the rapes in denmark is committed by a immigrant and they 're less than 8 % of the population . 
  but they are 90 % of the * poor * population . 
  poor people commit more crimes and are far more likely to be found guilty about it , it has nothing to do with being an immigrant or not . 
  if you deported all the immigrants you would find that the poorest 8 % of danes commits 30 % of the rapes . 
  more income for fraport -  more income for the german state -  less taxes for me . 
  the article you linked is a year old . 
  since then the auction was [ re-done ] ( http://www.iefimerida.gr/news/230785/ananeonoyn-tis-prosfores-toys-oi-treis-mnistires-gia-ta-14-perifereiaka-aerodromia ) ( link in greek ) with three offers , fraport , corporation america , and vinci but with the other two far below the `` target '' price set by the troika . 
  it was generally known for years now that fraport will take the airports ( and that we * have * to sell them ) . 
   true , but hoping for a better future becomes a bad business model at some point . 
  we disagree on a fundamental level . 
   the same way as with the fraport deal - multiple companies make offers for it and the greek government selects the one offering the best conditions . 
  this is not at all how the airport deal played out ( only fraport made an offer which we pretty much * had * to take per the referendum ) . 
  you are gravely uninformed about the whole situation . 
   does n't change that many of the railway employees are overpayed however . 
  railway salaries have dropped dramatically since the crisis began ( and were not that high even before the crisis compared to the rest of the public sector ) . 
   well , technically the victors of ww2 have limited our souvereignity for quite a while after ww2 to prevent further bad things . 
  privatisation is not a one-way ticket . 
  especially in the rail sector , concessions are usually made for limited amounts of time . 
  yeah , that was not my point ( unless you think that we should give up our sovereignty to fraport as well ... ) . 
  my point was that things change . 
  governments change and get better or worse . 
   yes , but if the state fails to solve the problems/doesnt even try to fix them , privatization is the way to go . 
  lets assume that that is the case ( which it is not , governments change ) . 
  what makes you think that our government is incompetent to run the railroads but competent enough to sell them ? 
  who says that we are not getting screwed over ? 
   fact is that your national railway is in a dire condition and that all attempts to fix it have not been successful . 
  that does not mean that our * future * attempts will be unsuccessful as well . 
   to get the railway into profitable area again , they severely need to reduce the infuence of the railway unions ( the wages your national railway pays are in many areas not sustainable ) ... no . 
  the biggest problem is corruption ( bad deals with siemens , undocumented stock moving around goods for companies on the black market etc. 
  great , so why ca n't we have a greek government-owned company that manages all the airports ? 
  are we indeed inferior to the germans ? 
  if it is like that then why not sell * everything * ? 
  why stop at airports ? 
  i am currently living and working in hessen and i find it absurd that i will have to pay less taxes in the long run because of this deal ... 
   decades of greek politicians have failed to accomplish that so what ? 
  decades of german politicians have produced two world wars but we still allow germans to govern themselves . 
   as a former minister of yours once said , it would almost be cheaper if all the greek railway passengers would use taxis instead . 
  i never said that the state of the railways is good ( believe me , i know ) . 
  i am just saying that privatization is not the answer to everything . 
  the state can be better . 
   and while greece might be an extreme case , state-owned railway companies have often proven to be less efficient , to offer lower quality services at a higher price . 
  on the other hand , there are examples where it works decently , e.g. 
  in korea or switzerland . 
  great , i want greece to be like korea or switzerland . 
   the point is : if the political class is unable to fix the problems , ( even partial ) privatisation would be the best way for both the state aswell as for the travellers . 
  if the political class is unable to fix the problems , we need a new political class . 
  it is absurd to say `` oh well , we are corrupt and stupid '' and just sell it all away . 
  what do you mean `` only '' ? 
  over 50 % means ** majority ** state owned i.e. 
  the state calls the shots because it owns the majority of the shares . 
  * or * , we could try to better the way the government manages the railroads ... do you cut your head off when you have a headache ? 
  you are aware that fraport ( the company that bought the airports ) is owned by the german state of hessen and thus is government owned , right ? 
   are n't there islands on which these will be the only airports , so that what has been done now will create a private monopoly on access to those islands by aircraft ? 
  yes , the majority of those airports are on single-airport islands , some far away from the mainland . 
   a ) which incursions are not in disputed territory ? 
  what do you mean * which * ? 
  what do you want , a date and a time ? 
  by definition , all incursions that are not over disputed territory are not over disputed territory . 
   please do n't give me a facile argument , as if the situations were at all the same . 
  a turkish f-16 is flying over rhodes for example ( [ relevant article in greek ] ( http://www.rizospastis.gr/story.do?id=1296093 ) ) it is ** exactly ** the same thing . 
  rhodes is greek territory recognised by everyone . 
  rhodes is not a grey zone . 
  you are being downvoted because your argument does not apply to the situation .
