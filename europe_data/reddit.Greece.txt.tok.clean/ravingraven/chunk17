  there are disputed territories in the aegean but : a ) turkish air force airspace incursions do not happen over * those * territories ( unless you count for example , rhodes or samos as a disputed territory , in which case you are being downvoted because you are a moron ) . 
  b ) overflying them with jets is not going to solve it . 
  that is a myth ( albeit a popular one ) . 
  there are a lot of jets flying over evia because of the air force training area ( lgr23a and lgr23b ) . 
  do i have to ? 
  you lie so so absurd , it is self-evidently false . 
  if you can find * even one * anarchist ( not just greek ) standing behind * any * merkel policy ( not just immigration ) i will admit i am wrong . 
  until then , you are a liar . 
   i 'm in athens and these anarchists will say merkel 's policies are only for germany , she 's destroying greece on purpose . 
  then they take a deep breath and continue saying merkel is a brilliant visionary bringing all these refugees to europe , we need more immigrants , we should be more like merkel . 
  you are lying . 
  anarchists are not supporting merkel or her policies on immigration , not in greece , not anywhere . 
  i am not making the argument that capitalism does not lead to growth , even though the growth in many of the countries you mentioned was fueled by post-war aid plans ( germany , japan ) or was followed by a crash ( ireland ) . 
  my two arguments are that : * economic equality trumps growth to an extent ( but , of course it makes little sense for * all * to be equally poor ) . 
  * historically poor nations ( i 'm talking africa-poor , not asia-poor ) do not have and will never have the opportunity to become wealthy in a free-market economy . 
  economic inequality and resource-post-colonialism are probably the biggest creators of unhappiness on the planet today and i do n't see it as realistic that the solution for kids starving in nigeria is the lack of start-ups . 
   if communism can only take root in poor ( and generally less educated countries ) , then maybe it 's not worth much ? 
   not really . 
  it is true ( and even marx and engels said this ) that * by design * , communism would probably be more successful in more advanced countries . 
  but ( for example ) the rise of russia from a backward , agricultural country to a space-faring superpower in less than 60 years should be historically be seen as a victory of socialist ideas applied on poor countries . 
   their actions . 
  agreed . 
  so , what someone has to prove when saying that communism prevents or creates poverty is proving that communist actions lead to that outcome . 
  marx never wrote about starving ukraine or executing people who wear glasses , nor did he ever write about forming tyrannical bureaucracies , so this becomes less and less about communist policy and more about dictatorships in poor countries . 
  so , what made the guys * before * deng xiaoping communists ? 
  since us calling them communists and they calling themselves communists are non-arguments , what do we use to decide ? 
   well , except that system has little to do with communism . 
  so , when it `` creates poverty '' its communism but when it moves people out of poverty it is n't . 
  got it . 
   what you really do n't want is the suggestions of your car mechanic and nancy wrinklebottom from next door . 
  your view on this is 100 % wrong . 
  all nancy wrinklebottom did was go and vote about * her * future . 
  her vote counts just as much as your does . 
  that is how democracy works . 
  people vote on ** their ** ( and not just your ) future and the majority wins . 
  politics is not surgery . 
   so why are n't we actually trying to address this problem somehow ? 
  what is better than people voting ? 
  what is better than democracy ? 
   if you have absolutely zero idea about economics , the eu , the uk , anything ... should you be allowed to decide where it 's heading ? 
  should there be some kind of test about who should or should not vote ? 
  cause i kind of remember someone doing something like this ... oh yeah , right : http://www.pbs.org/wnet/jimcrow/voting_literacy.html  how can you make an informed decision ? 
  so , who should decide who * can * make an informed decision ? 
  are you more informed than nancy ? 
  should * you * we allowed to vote ? 
  how can you prove that ? 
   democracy relies on the people being interested and educated . 
  sure , if people are not interested or not educated they will make bad decisions . 
  but is taking away democracy the answer to that ? 
  should we not be focusing on keeping people interested and educated instead ? 
   i do not know a better alternative , but i wo n't be silent about the existent problems . 
  there is absolutely no problem . 
  the only problem is you . 
  * you * claim that * you * know better than half the people in the u.k. and that they should do what * you * say instead of what they decided for themselves . 
  how are you ( or anyone ) more qualified to decide on this than literally more than half the british population ? 
  can you point me to anyone who would have made an * objectively * better decision ? 
  even your claimed experts lie on both sides of the issue . 
  can you even prove that remaining is * objectively * better than the exit ? 
  yeah !, 
  those uneducated morons should not be allowed to decide for themselves !, 
  that 's not what democracy is about !, 
  we , the educated , ones should be the only ones allowed to to that !, 
  `` common sense is whatever fits my narrative !, 
  yay ! '', 
  whatever ... 
   a similiar system was applied in the soviet union and gdr . 
  citation needed ( your link says nothing about that ) . 
  so it is just a nazi thing ( not even purely fascist ) and it also has very little ( if not nothing ) to do with what has been happening in turkey . 
  good job at being totally wrong and pulling things out of your ass . 
   ... to a political assimilation process that is deeply rooted in fascism and communism rhetoric . 
  uhm , no , it 's nothing like that . 
  the job of the government is to legislate ** and enforce ** . 
  an unenforced law is no law . 
   yeah i love the fact that if a corporation uses a scammy tactic to dodge taxes is the government 's fault somehow . 
  well , they share the fault if the government does nothing about it . 
  we are an incredibly tacky country , especially around christmas . 
  ok , trump was the fault of the left . 
  peace is war . 
  whatever ... 
   of course you can focus on fringe elements womens/lgbt rights etc. 
  are not fringe elements ...  ... but that will not motivate most of the people the left is hardly to blame about that . 
  you would not be able to motivate most of the people if you argued for the rights of the jews shortly before wwii , that does not mean that you * should n't * though ...  for example , lbgt rights , it is great they exist , but it is not important to most people , lbgt is a minority , if you focus on just these things , then non lgtb people will not bother . 
  that is very very wrong . 
  i am not lgbt , yet i care deeply about their rights . 
   of course , it is one of the battles they are winning , but that has more to do with the fact that people do not care for them either way the conservative right cares a great deal . 
  also , the left ca n't plan according to what the right things is important or not . 
   but since the focus on lgbt rights means there is less focus elsewere the right pushes back on those fronts . 
  and if the focus was elsewhere there would be push-backs on the lgbt front ... 
   so it is a `` religion '' , plenty of `` priest '' say it is so so no proof or arguments needed , it is just so ... no , it 's just you believing in an absurd thing . 
   and romas being oppressed it that because they are roma or because they refuse to be part of or comply with the laws of the society they live in ? 
  it 's because they are roma . 
  would you trade lives with a law-abiding roma ? 
  did n't think so . 
   that 's not an argument , you can google the moon landing was a hoax or 9/11 was an inside job and get plenty of hits . 
  you wo n't get a multitude of peer reviewed articles and sources from reputable think-tanks and news-sites though ... 
  in addition to that , i am not here to prove to you things that are crystal clear and widely accepted . 
  if you do n't want to believe that women are oppressed i do n't think a stranger on the internet can do anything about it ...  come up with a law where women do n't have equal rights come up with a law where roma do n't have equal rights . 
  you ca n't ? 
  that ** must ** mean that roma are not systemically oppressed . 
  congratulations you solved racism !,
