  not in greece . 
   we only have 40-60 years left of easily extracted uranium . 
  source ? 
  [ mine says 230 years . 
  ] ( http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-long-will-global-uranium-deposits-last/ ) take into account that nuclear energy production will propably become much more efficient while oil and coal will propably not . 
   because they are subsidised heavily by the state because no private corporation can build them on their own and no insurance company want to touch them . 
  again . 
  source ? 
  most states subsidise coal and oil as well ( most of the eu and the [ us ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/energy_subsidies ) )  super clean if you do n't count the mining or the disposal of nuclear waste . 
  nope . 
  i count that too . 
  still much cleaner than oil and coal . 
   which is not a lot for all that money required to build , maintain , de-construct and waste management . 
  source ? 
   except nuclear waste is highly dangerous and an accident at a coal/gas/oil plant is not as threatening as an accident in a nuclear plant . 
  history has shown that we are careful enough with nuclear energy that coal and oil have killed a lot more people than nuclear has ever . 
   uranium is n't available everywhere and is a finite resource . 
  so is oil and coal ( which are much more finite than uranium . ), 
   nuclear plants take several years to build , cost a lot of money to build and de-construct . 
  they cost more to build but cost less to run ( as uranium is much much cheaper than both oil and coal . ), 
  they also are super clean ( being dirty [ costs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carbon_tax ) [ money ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carbon_emissions_trading ) . ), 
   they ca n't run for many years ... 
  they * can * run for many years . 
  [ 40 to 60 ] ( http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/nuclear-fuel-cycle/nuclear-wastes/decommissioning-nuclear-facilities/ ) to be exact . 
  [ the average lifespan of a coal powerplant is 40 years . 
  ] ( http://qz.com/61423/coal-fired-power-plants-near-retirement/ )  ... and no nation on earth has come up with a way to safely store the nuclear waste . 
  yet , the envoirmental damage from nuclear waste is nothing compared to the damage by coal and oil powerplants . 
   northern epirus to greece . 
  as a greek : why ? 
  ( i am aware of the minority btw , its just that no one here really cares ... ), 
  so wrong . 
  number 1 is tavli of course ... :p, 
  i am trying to argue that owning a house is not the same as renting one , even if your mortgage payment and what you are paying for rent right now are the same . 
  because : * getting a mortgage means that you have to pay that mortgage off * and * maintain the house/pay taxes and so on . 
  many people can not afford that . 
  * if you buy a house you are stuck with a house and a mortgage . 
  you have to move ? 
  you lose your job ? 
  tough luck . 
  what people can afford today does not mean that hey can afford in the future too . 
  * you have to insure yourself and the house is now your risk and not the homeowners . 
  in addition to that , the figures you gave ( 100.000 euros for a house that costs 1000 euros to rent ) are off if we are talking about a small city and waaaaay off if we are talking about a big one . 
   who said anything about houses ? 
  it does not matter if it is a house or an apartment as long as it costs the same money ( 100.000 euro . ), 
   the house my sister has is worth 70k . 
  your sister would not be paying 1000 euro rent to live in the same house then . 
  account to that , that by owning a house you have to pay taxes , maintenance , insurance etc. . . 
  assuming that 100.000 euro is enough to buy a house in an area where it costs 1000 euro to rent one ( it is not ) it would take around 8 and a half years to pay up the mortgage . 
  yeah , that must be from a private hospital . 
  public hospital meal quality is different between hospitals , but is a lot closer to [ this ] ( http://nosokomeiolimnou.gr/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/fagito.jpg ) . 
   because that 's the core of the problem : your government is sufficiently fucked that it 's expenses are still above what its tax revenue is . 
  that particular problem needs fixing and has absolutely nothing to do with the euro . 
  by devaluing our own currency , our exports ( or actually services ) would be cheaper thus increasing an inflow of foreign capital and tax income . 
  simple as that . 
  this has been the main strategy for fighting a debt crisis since for ever . 
  greece is not some african nation and has a legitimate source of income ( tourism , agricultural products etc. ), 
  that would yield a lot more in revenue if we had direct control over our currency . 
   i pointed out that your debt was in foreign currencies so devaluing the currency would have done nothing to this debt . 
  well , changing to the euro did not change the currency of our debt before 2001 . 
  i really do not think that the currency our debt was in makes any difference , especially if you consider the fact that we also could just go bankrupt and not pay it at all ( something that is a lot more difficult within the eurozone . ), 
   yes , you can run a leaner state if your currency is worth nothing , but you can also just reconstruct the state and tax system which is necessary anyways . 
  but , as it turns out , you can not do both things at once . 
  greece has now a second even bigger structural problem and that is the lack of a welfare state . 
  this , combined with the high unemployment rate creates a vicious cycle , from which i can see no end . 
   that was my whole point . 
  you could not fix the problem before the euro either because nobody wanted your bonds any more on drachma . 
  i do not remember us ever having problems borrowing money though . 
  if it was internal or external debt does not really matter , all that matters is that we financed our deficits . 
  i am not saying that the debt crisis would not have happened if we did not have the euro ( although that might be the case . ), 
  i am saying that when a crisis happens it is better to have your own currency . 
   that graph shows that since 1995 your debt was the size of the gdp . 
  which back then seemed like a reasonable number . 
  belguim for example had a similar ( if not worse ) debt to gdp ratio . 
   the skyrocketing after 2004 happened because of the auditing more than the euro . 
  nope . 
  look at the figures : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0aonyzs4mzlzbddzsu2k2veq2elkwcnndotnhs3zwrke&amp;hl=en#gid=1  but that 's entirely unrelated to the euro . 
  it is very related to the euro . 
  as i said before , we borrowed a lot of cheap money because of the euro . 
  in additon to that , we could not devalue it because athens could not print money . 
  if we had our own currency we would borrow less and could react to the crisis by printing money . 
  i think [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:greek_debt_and_eu_average_since_1977.png ) graph says a lot . 
  look at what happens to our debt right after we adopt the euro . 
  it skyrocketed from manageable numbers to unmanageable ones . 
  i think that everyone should read [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_government-debt_crisis#controversy_about_media_coverage ) section of the relevant wikipedia article . 
  it really helps to put things into perspective . 
   greece built up two generations of people that have no economic understanding and make a sport out of dodging taxes . 
  even if greece would get a different currency it will not recover . 
  this is simply not true . 
  if the country was in such a state that it would not recover with its own currency it would have gone down a lot faster than 2008 . 
  sure , the greek state had its problems , most of which are systemic , but they were not big enough to inhibit it from working . 
  i mean , no matter how bit tax evasion is , it has been this way since the late 1970ies . 
  if your explanation is a failed state , then how could this state function for almost forty years , like it did ( out of the euro ) ? 
   the country was not fucked by the euro , it was fucked by politicians without economical planning building up huge debts and banks knowing that they will recoup through other countries that act as bailors . 
  we did not have a huge debt ( our debt was comparable or even smaller than many states that today have no problem . ), 
  that the state had * no * economic planning is a sensationalist thing to say that i am sure you are not able to back up with facts . 
  the fact that we borrowed a lot of cheap money because the euro was backed by the eu is true . 
  but ... a ) who did n't ? 
  back then we thought that if we did not borrow that money we would be `` left behind '' by the other small eu players . 
  it was understood ( partly because the eu had no problem accepting and certifying our cooked numbers ) that that was what we should do . 
  b ) at least some of that money went into infrastructure that in no way helped the greek economy and was mandated by the eu .
