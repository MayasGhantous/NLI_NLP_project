  maybe you can not vote for another politician , but you can vote for another party . '', 
  the answer is that most greeks did not have ( or thought that they do not have ) an option until recently . 
  until before the crisis the two major parties got more or less over 85 % of the vote . 
  this allowed them to : * have huge streams of campaign money ( = a lot of votes . ), 
  * install their people into places of power so that they can `` help '' citizens with their problem ( again , in exchange for votes . ), 
  * have a lot of experience with the governing `` game '' so that other parties were not deemed `` serious '' enough to govern . 
  another problem is that most other parties do not align politically with the majority of greeks . 
  i could not imagine someone who belongs to the center-right to be willing to vote for the communist party because he knows that the government is corrupt . 
  only recently has syriza managed to convince a sizable part of the voter base to vote for it , and this after it has toned down the left part of its political proposals considerably . 
  another huge problem is immunity . 
  even if syriza manages to govern after the next elections , the law protects former office holders . 
  those laws were voted during the last 20 years from the nd pasok governments and some people are literally untouchable . 
  yeah , it is really simple !, 
  have the government the germans have been bribing arrest the government the germans have been bribing . 
  wait ... 
  in-browser pdf rendering is usually bad . 
  better download it and open it with sumatrapdf . 
  it does . 
  otherwise he would not say it . 
  yeah . 
  not many people know this . 
  kinder is also not german ( but haribo is . ), 
   where is the greek milka ? 
  first of all , milka is not german . 
  second , the greek milka is lacta and it is aweosme . 
  https://greekmarket.co.uk/images/p/lactakaramela.jpg third , the biggest single employer in germany is the german state . 
  siemens ( the biggest private employer ) has 362,000 employees while the number of germans working for the state is 4,8 millions . 
  you are not required to decide on any subject if you do n't feel like it . 
  `` the traveling players '' - greece . 
  first of all heckler & koch is german as well . 
  germany also has siemens defence , thyssenkrupp , atlas elektronik , panavia and many many others . 
  i will have to disagree with you . 
  `` some parties '' think that by never going to war we are doing more good than harm . 
  my country ( greece ) has already had dirty relationships as far as military equipment manufacturing/buying goes with your country ( germany ) and a host of other countires ( france , israel , russia , usa etc. ), 
  can you be sure that we will not be having wars for the sake of war ? 
  because the military industry in your country is more than willing to act corrupt ( it already did so in my country . ), 
  what is holding them back is the general aversion of your population towards war . 
   forging financial data to join a currency club seems as an example of the latter . 
  said currency club knew well ahead that the numbers were not right . 
  let us in anyway . 
  more like the german one ... 
  luxemburg is aaa . 
  ok ( not that i agree but anyway ) first of all , what does this have to do with my `` mentality '' and second : what does this have to do with my argument ? 
  uhm . 
  ok . are you able to explain this a bit . 
  i do not think that i understand what you mean . 
   0.7 % isn \u00b4 t growing well , it is . 
  0 % is not growing . 
  anything over that is ** by definition ** growing . 
  and it is projected to grow even higher . 
  also , as a person who is working in germany at the moment i can tell you that things are great for business . 
   guess what , you have to live with what you got , and for a lot of us . . ain \u00b4 t much . 
  no i do n't . 
  i have to live with what i make . 
   you assume that this all sadomasochist reforms are wrong because unemployment is high and economy is not growing , as a matter of fact the economy is shrinking ... no i do not assume that . 
  i assume that the reforms are wrong because they do not solve anything , even worse they create bigger problems . 
  oh and btw , the economy in germany is slowly growing . 
  because welfare is not `` a free lunch . '', 
  when something is going wrong you can do three things : * keep doing what you were doing , which obviously will not solve the problem . 
  * do something new that will solve the problem . 
  * do something new that will ** not ** solve the problem . 
  it is evident that we were doing something wrong all those years . 
  be advised that all those years the `` extreme left '' was pretty much the only political side that was ** screaming ** that something was going wrong . 
  back then it was dismissed as pessimistic and negative . 
  the `` extreme left '' does not want the status quo to be maintained . 
  it did not want that even when * everyone else * ( including both major parties and the eu ) thought that the status quo is a good thing . 
  the left ( myself included ) wants a change to a * different direction . 
  * it says that the solution we have found ( or better : that is dictated to us ) is not a solution for us . 
  it might be a solution for eu or the banks or whatever , but it is not a solution for the average working greek . 
   do you think samaras is right ? 
  but then again , i did n't vote for him . 
   should there be more pressure on him ? 
  he should just quit or get fired . 
  i can not see any scenario where him or his coworkers could do anything that would end up as positive for the future of the country . 
   could he succeed fighting beaureaucracy [ sic ] ? 
  this depends on what you mean by `` bureaucracy . '', 
  he can and does destroy the public sector . 
  i am politically against that . 
  so are most greeks . 
  i do not have the time to look up any data for it , so take it as you will but you will not find many greeks that are for privatizing the health , education , mass transit etc. 
  sectors . 
  the government 's argument is that `` public sector equals bad '' and that by cutting it or eliminating it the healthy private sector will take over and everything will be better . 
  i think that their `` small government '' argument is just a cover for all the actions that have been made towards meeting the troika quotas . 
  `` we are getting fucked but it is good for us . '', 
  if by `` bureaucracy '' you mean that he will eliminate the ( very real ) bureaucracy and corruption in the public and private sector then , no . 
  the bureaucracy and corruption are both very much here . 
  from the small things like small scale bribery , uninsured and black market labour , and small scale tax evasion to big things like big corp briberies to high government officials , huge subsidies and tax cuts to friendly entrepreneurs and mass hirings of people who are `` friendly dispositions towards the leading parties . '', 
  samaras is no less `` greek '' than anyone before him . 
  he just goes along with the neoliberal game that is going on . 
  in greece , almost never . 
  the state does not care for them in any way . 
   after you put words into my mouth and then give me a list of pseudo-knowledge [ ... ] what did i put in your mouth and what `` knowledge '' of mine is not true ? 
  i 'm glad i do . 
  have fun dealing with them like that : http://www.thelocal.se/50968/20131023/, 
  uhm . 
  i am saying that : in my country and all the countries i have a connection with , the roma situation is similar and i highly doubt that sweden is some kind of big exception to that . 
  again , i do not know what is happening in sweden . 
  i know that they are more discriminated against most ( if not all ) social groups in greece , hungary , croatia , romania etc. 
  the countries i have visited or know people from . 
  but i have a strong hunch that the same is true in sweden ( also judging from the comment you made about choosing who you would want your neighbour to be . ),
