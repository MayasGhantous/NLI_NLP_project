  i do n't need to you to prove anything to me . 
  poverty is among the many reasons the roma are as they are . 
  the biggest reason is how you view them . 
  so you do n't live in poverty . 
  or in a ghetto . 
  and you have plenty of access to education and can be employed . 
  and you are not a minority . 
  anyway ... 
  your opening argument was this :  i think the root of the problem is that some roma abuse their kids by sending them onto the streets to beg for money . 
  my opinion is that , while some of the roma do send their kids to the streets to beg for money , this is easily explainable if you look at the social situation those people are living in . 
  many places in asia , latin america and africa can not replicate this situation because in order for begging to be successful there need to be at least some ( but preferably many ) rich ( er ) people you can beg from . 
  it would be stupid to beg in the streets of a country where everyone is poor . 
  that being said , there are a lot of kids begging in the streets of bogota , caracas , delhi and so on ... 
  i understand that your argument is that it is a part of roma culture to have kids begging . 
  many people believe that it is so . 
  i think this is a wrong place to start from because you are abusing the term `` culture . '', 
  i am not saying that roma do not behave in this way . 
  they * evidently * do . 
  i am saying that what you describe as roma culture , i describe as `` being poor and uneducated . '', 
  and it is as much part of the roma culture to be `` poor and uneducated '' as it is part of the jewish culture to be `` rich and educated . '', 
  additionally , what you have to understand is that roma are desperately poor and uneducated and are a stark contrast to their wealthy and educated surroundings ( as they live in europe . ), 
  roma are the poorest social group in most countries they are a minority in . 
  uhm . 
  i do n't really care about those numbers to be honest . 
  but sure , go ahead . 
   you repeat opinions like they are facts which they are not . 
  you do the same thing . 
  you repeat opinions like they are facts and you repeat that what i say is not fact . 
  here you go : http://ec.europa.eu/justice/discrimination/files/roma_hu_strategy_annex1_en.pdf this is a paper explaining the economical situation of the roma in hungary . 
  it say that 70 % of the roma live below the poverty line . 
  additionally you can read that :  roma women ** fall behind ** both roma and non-roma men and ** non-roma women ** in ** almost every department ** ; education , participation in the labour market and income . 
  there you go . 
  roma women have it the worst in hungary . 
  in almost every department . 
  i do n't feel like researching for you but i am sure that you will find that the same is true for all european countries . 
  i hope in that , in the future you can turn your `` this guy is wrong and i am right '' attitude to a `` what if this guy is right ? 
  i should look it up '' attitude . 
  thank you and have a good day . 
  i do n't get what you mean . 
  you have been living in poverty in asia , latin america , and africa for the last 15 years ? 
  did you move a lot ? 
  or is it just a figure of speech ? 
  i ca n't see how we can find common ground on talking about this . 
  you seem to be very negatively dispositioned against roma people as is evident on the last part of your comment . 
  i will try to explain some things while i do not feel like either changing your mind or defending my own . 
  i am just trying to make you think about some stuff you might have gotten wrong . 
   you are making it up to fit into your views on romas ...  i would like you to back it up with facts , as in scientific links please . 
   can you prove that ? 
  i neither have the time or the will to look up `` scientific links . '', 
  if you do not believe that the roma live under a social stigma and a sub par societal structure , then ok . have it your way . 
  if you want to research yourself then here : http://www.errc.org/index is a place to start . 
   or you are completely unaware of their history of those people ? [ ... ], 
  i never said that the kurds or eritreans ( or any immigrant ) have it * good . 
  * they do n't . 
  what i said is that most aspects of their live are * better * than the lives of most roma . 
  i have never been to sweden and i do n't know ( or care ) how things are there . 
  but the situation of the roma in most european countries i have been too is the lowest of the low . 
  that includes : hungary , croatia , skopje , bulgaria and greece ( my home country . ), 
  hope i could be helpful . 
  while you did not answer my question i will try to answer yours . 
  it is because kurds and eritreans have it better than romas . 
  kurds are more educated and come from a place with higher living standards than that of a romanian/bulgarian/hungarian etc. 
  roma ghetto . 
  you probably have never visited the environments in which those people grew up in ... maybe talking with some of the roma in your community and asking them about their past and present living environment will explain some situations that you might have witnessed or heard about . 
  because other welfare groups are not roma . 
  i have made this point in the past and i will make it again to explain my point of view to you : if you ** had to ** trade lives with one of the following stereotypical welfare groups , which one would it be : * single mother in a low paying job . 
  * junkie/alcoholic who can not hold a job . 
  * person with mental health problems . 
  * roma . 
  keep in mind that you have to get the whole package i.e. 
  live in the house of one of those people . 
  do the same job ( or suffer the lack of it ) and face the social stigma that comes with it . 
  to be honest with you , being a roma is very low on my list . 
  now ask yourself this : if you had to trade your neighbour with one of the aforementioned stereotypes , which one would you choose ? 
  also : imagine you are a roma that is also an alcoholic/junkie/single mother/a person with mental health problems ( being a roma puts you in high risk of being all those things , sometimes combined . ), 
  i think , us trying to get into the shoes of the day to day lives ( and not the snippets of illegality we see on tv/choose to remember ) we will get far more insight about how things actually are . 
  the issue is ** not only ** poverty . 
  if you were living in a ghetto , surrounded by extreme poverty ( not the `` i ca n't buy the latest iphone '' poverty but the `` i do n't have food and heating '' poverty , ) with limited ( or no ) access to education , with zero chance of employment outside of what society thinks is appropriate for a person of your social surroundings you would too be highly statistically likely to send your kids to beg for money . 
  in addition to that : it will be hard to find a social group that is as poor as the roma . 
   the yuppies in europe and america who scream about tolerance do n't live anywhere near ethnic/racial minorities . 
  you will see people who scream about tolerance living near ethnic/racial minorities . 
  you should visit athens . 
  the experience will change your mind . 
  this whole `` roma steal kids '' thing is 100 % ridiculous . 
  i ca n't believe that even educated and open minded people here in greece ever thought that the `` stolen kid '' scenario was ever plausible . 
  roma are not idiots . 
  shit like this is the root of the problem with the roma . 
  if we keep treating them like we do they will keep behaving like they do . 
  what does this story tell us ( as well as the story with the greek roma , where it turned out that the parents were not lying when they said that they got her from bulgarian parents with their consent . ), 
  it tells us that if you are a white european and someone takes your child a shirtstorm will ensue . 
  if you are a roma no one will fucking care . 
  the biggest part of the greek `` stolen kid '' story is that the kid is `` fair haired and white . '', 
  what about all the other , non-fair haired kids ? 
  what about the ghettos we create for them in aspropyrgos and dendropotamos ? 
  what about all those other kids that get married off when they are 12 or are begging on the street ? 
  no one gives a fuck . 
  but what happens if you happen to be blonde and white ? 
  you are on the front page of every news outlet in europe . 
  next time someone argues that `` we try to help the roma but they do not want to help themselves '' he/she should think of those incidents . 
  they do know that .
