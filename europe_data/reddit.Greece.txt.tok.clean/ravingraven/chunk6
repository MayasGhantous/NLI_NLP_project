  the kid was propably bought . 
  i do not know if this is still happening ( i doubt it ) but a more plausible explanation would be that they bought the kid from someone . 
  they searched all through the interpol database and could not find a match for her dna . 
  there are plenty of poor blond-haired people living nearby greece ( bulgaria would be an example . ), 
  yes . 
  a stroll through / r/askhistorians is very recommended . 
  i ca n't say that i agree with you . 
  we greeks are world champions in sticking to the ancient past to fish up personalities , ideals and ideas to be proud of . 
  and from experience i can tell you that this is propably a bad idea . 
  the reasons are that : * romans ( and ancient greeks ) lived a long long long time ago . 
  back then things were different . 
  we tend to identify with the good things that stood the test of time and reflect in today 's world but that is ( as / u/pinegenie pointed out ) nitpicking . 
  did the acient greeks have democracy ? 
  sure ( sort of ) but only if you were a male , non-slave , athenian . 
  and even then only for certain parts of the executive and law-making process of society . 
  * again : romans ( and ancient greeks ) lived a long long long time ago . 
  since then ( and thanks to colonization ) what remained of their influence got spread out to a lot of places ( most notably , the usa ) and stopped being a clear cut european thing . 
  * many of the ideals you mention ( liberty , equality ) do not need anything to stand on . 
  we have evolved our understanding of the human condition to the point where those ideals are self-evident . 
  they do not need a glorious past to be validated ( and it is at least ironic to speak of equality and liberty in a society where slavery was a thing . ), 
  * people that do not identify with those ideas can just as easily twist the popular image we have of the romans to increase the appeal and validate their ideas . 
  since you are german you must be extremely familiar with those scenes : http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-46i-hqo0er8/unnq8ewasji/aaaaaaaauza/9ejbwrykebq/s1600/myphoto.jpeg http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/bellamy_salute_1.jpg funnily enough , the neo-nazis in my country are using the `` roman salute '' ( which never existed in the roman times , by the way ) as an `` ancient greek salute to apollo '' ( equally ridiculous ) thereby `` validating '' their actions as actions taken from a time when greece was important . 
  claims of ancestry from people who lived during that time also validate `` good greek blood . '', 
  thus , the reverse can be true as well . 
  people who have never seen a mathematics book in their lives claim they are superior because their ancestors `` invented mathematics . '', 
  clinging to the past can be a dangerous thing . 
  we have the knowledge and opportunity to be greater than the romans ever were . 
  we ( everyday , ordinary europeans ) understand philosophical and ethical ideas and possess powers of reasoning that the average roman would never even dream of . 
  we have technology that would be perceived as magic back then . 
  we are indeed in the position to solve most of the world 's problems and explore space if we would so choose . 
  maybe instead of looking at the past it would be a better idea for you to start looking to the future . 
  hope i did n't tire you with my huge post . 
  finds include ( among others  knifes , automatic rifles and a 1940s anti-aircraft gun . 
  from the article :  the findings have raised questions about whether pallis had contacts within the police force as his home was first raided on june 7 and none of these items was discovered then . 
  a senior police source told kathimerini that officers had only been searching the property for documents at the time . 
  and ...  this week 's searches were conducted after a retired british military officer , edward pringle-stacey , wrote via his lawyer to the supreme court to provide information that he thought may be useful for authorities in their search for weapons that golden dawn could be hiding . 
   pringle-stacey alleged that in 2011 , when he was working with pallis , an ex-associate of shipowner victor restis , he saw a collection of about ** 4,000 firearms ** at premises owned by pallis , who is currently wanted by authorities for the illegal possession of 70 guns . 
  according to the british witness , the weapons included ** ak-47 and m16 assault rifles ** . 
  i am in fact not . 
  i tend to stay away from the whole `` extreme politics '' label . 
  i do not think that the far-right is bad because it is `` extreme '' ( whatever `` extreme '' might mean . ), 
  i think that it is wrong by principle . 
  what is worth noting here is that people that describe the political situation as `` the extremes are rising '' are overlooking the fact that the far-left is not rising . 
  not in france and not in greece . 
  it is the far-right that is on the rise . 
  i think the reason for that is deeply systemic . 
  edit : i understand how a comment like the original might be perceived as `` controversial '' ( at this time is has 9 upvotes and 9 downvotes ) but i think that it is better understood when you do not think about it from a polarised `` extreme = bad '' point of view ( that i reject anyway ) and instead look at things as how they are i.e. 
  the french moving towards the far right because they are ** genuinely ** becoming more conservative , xenophobic etc. 
  kind of took them a while ... 
  i 've been seeing them posted around since last year . 
  the french far-right avoided all the communication and timing mistakes that the greek far-right did n't . 
  we should be afraid of other far-right parties in the eu following their example . 
  this is all very worrisome ... 
  yay !, 
  i do n't think it does . 
  look at our numbers ... 
  yes . 
  yes it is . 
   you can bring up 17n as well , but those are anarchists they are not . 
  they are marxist/communist and therefore very very pro-state . 
  just not the current state . 
   extremism is all the same , wether right or left . 
  the far-right uses violence . 
  the far-left uses violence . 
  therefore the far-right is the far-left . 
  it must be a mistake . 
  i lived for a long time in a city close to volos and no way we got over 200 days per year . 
  there is no place even near greece that gets that much ... 
  12 is volos , greece . 
  really ? 
  hmmm ... 
  while i do agree that at least some part of the gd voter base is composed of people who `` hate '' the traditional political parties of greece , this note must be accompanied by a reference to the deep and strong past of the far-right in greece . 
  it is easy to reduce the voting base of any party in greece to a mass of `` average '' people that vote for sentimental and apolitical reasons ( like you did in your post for syriza . ), 
  i think that if you look at the big picture you will find it at least misleading . 
  the voting base of gd might not care about/understand the specifics of the politics that the party it is voting for is supporting ( just like not all voters of kke are not experts on marxism-leninism ) , but i can not imagine that someone who votes for gd can be positively dispositioned towards gay or immigrant rights ( for example . ), 
  people who voted for gd are in any case ultra-conservative . 
  we might not live in a nation where 7 % ( or even 15 % according to some polls ) of the voters are neo-nazis but we do live in a nation where a percentage similar to that are very very right wing . 
  this can be easily seen by analysing the approval ratings of the 60ies junta . 
  those people did not just die off . 
  they were absorbed by new democracy ( the party that rules greece and that still has some very very right wing people sitting in its benches in parliament ) or laos . 
  they were also silenced by the noise that was created after the junta fell and the abundance of the 90ies . 
  i understand that it is very hard for us to accept that some of our co-citizens have views like that , but they do . 
  it is scary and wrong , yet true . 
  those people were faintly visible with the exploitation of the albanians or the `` macedonia '' and `` devil - id '' rallies of the 90ies but no one gave a fuck back then . 
  i do n't think that what you said is true . 
  i have my believes but if someone disagrees and means well i will welcome it . 
  i would not be vehemently against an action that would render gd illegal . 
  i just want to express my view . 
  this is reddit after all . 
  how is this my argument ? 
   care to elaborate ? 
  i 'm assuming you 're part of some party associated with syriza ? 
  no i am not part of any party . 
  i was part of a local organisation in my home city ( i 've moved since . ), 
  i am part of the general left/far-left movement that is locally active in squats , open assemblies and demonstrations . 
  there are a lot of flavours of `` left '' . 
  i consider anyone fighting for the rights of the working class as a comrade . 
  that might mean ( especially in the us ) to push the state to legislate against multinational companies and in favour of the worker . 
   greece sounds fucked by the way . 
  the weather is nice .
