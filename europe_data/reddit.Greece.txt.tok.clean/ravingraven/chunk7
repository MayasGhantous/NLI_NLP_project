  greece had too !, 
  ( well , not for 70 years but , long enough . ), 
  guess what you need for that : money . 
  jobs . 
  not enough of those around those days . 
  i agree ( well , not really , but i can see your point . ), 
  i do not judge them . 
  i know that they are part of the workforce and i grew up and live in the same society they live in and i have the same problem with them and i know it is hard and i can relate . 
  ** but : ** the future of my country and my ( imaginary ) kids is at stake . 
  i can not and will not just hug them with the love they never saw and hope they will understand how wrong they are . 
  i will not treat them like the idiots that they are because i am in no position to do that right now . 
  it is greece . 
  crisis greece . 
  no room for that anymore . 
  their stupidity cause some very very real problems which i have to address . 
  in real life , now . 
  no , i do not . 
  but i do think that a percentage really close to 10-15 % is conservative enough to agree with the policies that are being proposed by the gd . 
  oh yes , yes . 
  i am aware that you are not an idiot racist . 
  it was just a figure of speech . 
   i do think that if the polis of a nation can not create political parties which are electable compared to fascists then the state and other political parties have failed in their duties and obligations . 
  agreed . 
  again . 
  not an excuse to be or vote for racists . 
   but surely not 10-15 % actually actually support the policies of the golden dawn , yea ? 
  why not ? 
  while you are de facto right about greek politicians being unelectable i will still have to disagree with you . 
  if you are a racist idiot that is your problem . 
  society does not have to build a safety net around you so that you do n't get crazy one day , form a party and start killing people and invading poland . 
  you either stop being a racist idiot or you face the consequences . 
  it is not my fault you are a racist . 
  ok . how would you go about that ? 
  the gd can claim that it is not a criminal organization ( which on paper it indeed is not ) even though some members of it might be criminals . 
  there have never been or ever will be an official call for violence from the party heads . 
  even if we turn a blind eye and bend the law a bit then they could be legally characterized as illegal . 
  but it would still have deep political roots . 
  it is basically the government telling the judges to render them illegal . 
  is not everyone responsible for what he does ? 
  how is this an excuse for voting for fascists ? 
   just a joke , albeit a dumb one . 
  i understood it is a joke . 
  i just do n't get how it is funny . 
  i guess `` being greek '' meant being lazy and not paying taxes , but that makes zero sense in this context . 
  anyway ... 
  your reply rises the question of when a government ( or state ) represents its people . 
  this is a long conversation i should not get involved in because i do n't feel i have enough knowledge or am smart enough to contribute anything that has not been said already . 
  what i can and will do though is explain how i logically arrived to what i currently believe about this particular subject in my home country , greece : greece has a parliamentary democracy system . 
  right off the bat this excludes a small minority from taking part in the parliament , namely those who voted for representatives that had the lower than 3 % vote quantum needed to enter parliament ( i.e. 
  it excludes those who voted for very small parties . ), 
  the greek voting system can and does change with almost every new government to go according to its needs and interests . 
  example : pasok and new democracy changed the voting law repeatedly to exclude or include immigrant greek voters in other countries or foreign immigrants in greece as the greek immigrants would vote for the right and foreigners would vote for pasok . 
  this of course leaded to more exclusion or inclusion . 
  many greeks do not vote . 
  about 20-30 % of those registered do not vote ( more do not vote for local elections . ), 
  this number hints that at least some people refuse to take part in the process as it is ( i do not vote for that reason . ), 
  greek elections are manufactured to favour the majority party . 
  the majority party gets a bonus of 50 out of 300 seats of the parliament ( a 20 % boost . ), 
  this means that the majority party is unequally represented in the parliament . 
  the law also gives extensive headroom to the majority party to pass laws unchecked ( even put a non elected representative in charge as happened with lucas papademos . ), 
  as a note i want to say that the troika memorandums passed by parliament vote and not by referendum as it was supposed to happen . 
  greek politicians are corrupt and well protected from the law and thus , unchecked . 
  there have been dozens of political scandals the past 30 years . 
  while some of those politicians are not starting to face charges and jail time it is my opinion that it is the tip of the iceberg . 
  there is also a law that grants immunity to the whole government after a new one is sworn in . 
  corruption and immunity lead to social and financial power who in turn lead to bought votes . 
  i really could go on but i will not to keep the list relevant both to our conversation and politics in greece . 
  get politically active and organize . 
   you 're being very greek about this . 
  what does this mean ? 
   please , tell me again , if you do n't see the murder as an isolated incident , why are you anti-ban ? 
  outlawing the party is a social action . 
  because , even though it 's the state , who acts here , state is merely a form of how society is organised . 
  because : * it is my opinion that the state created the problem that created the rise of the gd in the first place . 
  * the state is unable to solve it since parts of it ( especially the police ) have been at least reluctant to take action against the gd . 
  * state legislation is not social action because ( in my opinion ) the state as it is does not represent greek society at this moment . 
  * a ban * could * complicate matters even more by alienating the voting base of the gd . 
  i think that it is * very * important . 
  the political future of the country is more important than some people doing illegal stuff . 
  if we want to face facts we would see that banning the gd is a political action and not `` just '' an action of legislation just like the murder of the man in athens two days ago was not `` just '' a murder . 
  citing the 10-15 % they get at polls was wrong of me . 
  the defining factor is that they are the ** third ** party as far as voting power goes . 
  greek voting habits are widely fragmented ( as opposed to the `` two heavy parties '' system of the 90ies . ), 
  the deeper part of the problem is that a large part of the greek population has been historically ultra-conservative . 
  this can be seen by the junta approval ratings during the 60ies , the happenings of the civil war and the number of people who worked with the axis during wwii . 
  the far ( ish ) right has a strong political base that gets absorbed by the highest bidder . 
  at this time it is the golden dawn . 
  crisis helped but those people who made it happen were always there , more recently voting for laos or new democracy . 
  maybe * we * should do our duty too ... 
  because the left rules greece ? 
   i say ban golden dawn , lock them away , and throw away the keys ... and who will do that ? 
  the greek police ? 
  i do n't care what the fascists will do . 
  i have come to terms with the fact that they will be around no matter what . 
  it is the popular support they enjoy at the moment that is the problem . 
   i think that all depends on how effectively a ban would be policed . 
  another thing that renders any attempt to illegalize gd in greece impossible . 
  http://blogs.aljazeera.com/blog/europe/high-police-support-greeces-golden-dawn also : it is widely reported from eye witnesses that police were present during the murder of the man , the day before yesterday and `` did not act '' . 
  source in greek ( sorry ) : http://news.in.gr/greece/article/?aid=1231265676, 
  well , i am not a huge fan of how democracy is being practiced in greece at the moment .
