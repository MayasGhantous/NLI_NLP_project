  i do think that political freedom should be treated as a dogma but we should also examine how the greek state ( i.e. 
  its biggest political components ) are treating political organisations that are too small to have an impact in the media . 
  people are silenced a lot here . 
  freedom of speech levels dropped significantly the past few years , to the point that some forms of political expression have been rendered de-facto illegal or at least significantly suppressed ( protests , squats etc. ), 
  i am not claiming that because they do wrong on one part of the political spectrum they should extend it to the whole but , in times of crisis you have got to think about your self preservation . 
  there are less margins to be politically correct and polite . 
  to be honest with you , years ago when gd was still just a small neo-nazi organisation i would feel `` meh '' about it . 
  i belong to the greek left . 
  i hate gd more than anyone . 
  but , making them illegal would be a big mistake . 
  about 10-15 % of greek voters support them . 
  you can not just illegalize something that that many people support ( no matter how hideous it is . ), 
  the gd problem can only be solved by conscious social action and not by legislation . 
  it is a really complicated matter . 
  along with the name come : * territorial claims . 
  * historical claims . 
  * claims of an oppressed macedonian minority in greece . 
  i am from makedonia ( the greek part ) and i could not give a flying fuck about how our neighbours in the north are named . 
  i also am aware that the dispute is generated and perpetuated by mainly right wing nationalists from both countries , but : * teaching to your slavic population that they are in any ways descendants of the population that lived there 2500 years ago is wrong . 
  i also , of course , think that the history of our ancestry that we are taught about ourselves here in greece is wrong too . 
  * tainting historical research with your nationalistic claims is wrong . 
  again , true for both sides . 
  * there is no oppressed macedonian minority in greece . 
  i 've lived there and i have never met a person who describes himself as such and any claims from the skopje side are unsubstantiated . 
  we do treat other people like shit here ( see : immigrants ) but we do n't oppress a `` macedonian minority '' because there is none to oppress . 
  let 's not forget that :  on 26 february 2012 the danish newspaper berlingske reported that us authorities evidently have sufficient control over swift to seize money being transferred between two eu countries ( denmark and germany ) , since they have seized around u$ 26,000 which were being transferred from a danish to a german bank . 
  the money was a payment by a danish businessman for a batch of cuban cigars previously imported to germany by a german supplier . 
  as justification for the seizure , the u.s. treasury has stated that the danish businessman has violated the united states embargo against cuba . 
   $ 96/month wow . 
  really ? 
  hey . 
  i studied electronic telecoms and did a lot of research in greek telecom systems . 
  due to the variable greek geography and the non-uniform way technological advances are applied to the network , xdsl speed can vary ** dramatically ** depending on location . 
  on dense urban regions ( i.e. 
  athens and thessaloniki ) you should expect your speed to be linearly correlated to your distance from your dslam ( which might not be the closest one to you , geographically . ), 
  otherwise , it might be the case that your data might have to use 20 + year old coaxial links or even radio links . 
  smaller cities might also be heavily under-equipped and might suffer on peak times . 
   phone conversation with greek parents mostly involve the words : `` ne '' , `` ohi '' and `` entaxei '' . 
  greekest thing in this thread . 
   asking for a bailout was greece 's own decision . 
  pretending that it was n't , and even worse that somehow everyone else is responsible is silly . 
  asking for a bailout was the decision of the greek goverment of that time . 
  i am not pretending it was not . 
   i take it you do n't believe austerity works . 
  define `` works . '', 
  it is not with no effect , yes . 
  it does `` work '' in changing * something * . 
  but i do not think that this * something * that it changes is the change i want to have in my country . 
  disclaimer : i am aware that no matter in how much i disagree with how my own country works and worked before crisis and no matter how much i disagree with how the global economy works , i live in a work where i do not get to decide ( sadly . ), 
  i am aware that the world is as it is and we will just have to deal with it . 
  the free market is the free market and that is that . 
  i believe ( and i 'm eager to be convinced otherwise ) that the greek crisis is more than just a `` black-white solution '' situation . 
  it 's not : either you take austerity measures and the bailout package or you all die in riots and poverty . 
  i am pretty sure there are other ways . 
  and i feel like those ways are not discussed as much as they should be . 
  even if we assume that what is happening now in greece is the 100 % correct way to go about it , there still should be debate just for the academic merit of it . 
  that debate just is not there . 
  it feels like a big agenda is just being pushed that , i think , is more for the benefit of the creditors and the investors than the greek people . 
   it hurts . 
  yes . 
  it does . 
  and i would be ok with it if i knew that this is for the best but i just am not . 
  believe me , if you were living here you would feel the same . 
  if you saw practically everyone with talent and a will to work leave the country you could only think to yourself `` how can this lead to * anything * better in ** any ** hypothetical future . 
  i am sure that this is not the case in finland . 
  i 've got ta thank you for that great and detailed answer . 
   you make some great points . 
  yet , i will have to say that we disagree . 
  i guess most some of the things i disagree are on the political level so i can find no use arguing about them ( at least not here . ), 
  i am aware that it is :  too late lamenting that . 
  in 2010 your government asked for financial assitance programme from the eu and imf . 
  i was just expressing my opinion . 
  also , what was asked can be unasked . 
  greece , after all is a country and has sovereignty over its soil . 
  i agree that there need to be reforms ( but no job cuts ) in the public sector . 
  i agree that there should be checks and constant evaluations . 
  i disagree on the privatisations . 
  we have privatised a lot over the years ( even before the crisis ) and we have gained nothing from it ( organisations that turned a profit were a de facto loss , organisations that broke even were sold off way to cheaply and organisations that had losses could not be sold in their entierty and the state had to retain the `` bad '' part . ), 
  given political initiative , the public sector can be efficient enough ( or so i choose to believe . ), 
  traffic on the port has trebeled , but what did we gain from it ? 
  i am sure that the greek state could have easily made the minimal investments ( which , by the way , it now breaks its back to make after the port went private , see : new railway ) to raise productivity there . 
  maybe it is not in the imf papers but , except for taxation virtually all changes made during the troika years were in the public sector . 
  someone is clearly pushing for heavy reforms there and the troika is ok with it . 
   at this point of time it 's quite late to still be pondering it when those should have happened long before yesterday . 
  of course i agree . 
  i have been thinking of changes for a long time now . 
  but it is still nice to have theoretical conversations . 
  whatever . 
  which would not be a huge problem if we had our own currency . 
  i will have to disagree with you on some points . 
  greece demands structural reforms . 
  yes . 
  you will not find one greek who will claim that what had been happening for all those years was ok . 
  the question is what those reforms should be . 
  the troika and many people here in reddit focus on the public sector . 
  i just can not see how that was our biggest problem . 
  where there instances of clientism ? 
  sure . 
  should those that were illegaly hired be fired ? 
  absolutely .
