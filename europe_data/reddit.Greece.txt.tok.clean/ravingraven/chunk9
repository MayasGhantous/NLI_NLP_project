  but : i want to live in a country that has free and universial healthcare . 
  closing down hospitals with the intention of pushing the private sector to make up for it is not something i think of as `` necessary structural reforms . '', 
  underpaying and cutting positions in the education sector does not sound like `` necessary structural reforms . '', 
  selling out the nationalised power industry , the trains , the ports and the airports feels more like a political move than weeding out the bad parts of our economy . 
  it feels more like a liberisation of our economy . 
  public sector jobs are not that many . 
  we have fewer public sector workers per capita than germany does . 
  our actuall retirement ages are not low . 
  why do we have to change those things ? 
  and even if we do , i do n't feel like the troika should have anything to do with it . 
  because you can forsee the future/simulate the alternate past ? 
  the same economists that thought austerity would work ? 
  anyway . 
  what i see a lot in those `` greek crisis '' threads ( not from you personally , of course ) is the words `` not good for greece '' when you really mean to say a ) `` not good for the eu '' , b ) `` not good for the creditors of greece '' or c ) `` not good for the people who want to invest money in greece . '', 
  i am aware that all those things are connected and that one influences the other but , when i say `` the good of greece '' i am talking about myself , my family and anyone else who lives there . 
  i do not give a fuck about the creditors or the investors because i know they do not give a fuck about me either . 
  we do not have a liquidity crisis . 
  we have a debt crisis . 
  defaulting will make a lot of sense when ( and , of course , if ) we stop having deficits . 
  on the other hand , greece is not argentina . 
   ... punishing not keeping political promises ... 
  i do n't think that this is fair . 
  you ca n't predict the future . 
  maybe something that seems doable now will turn into something impossible later . 
  i am trying to explain why i , a leftist , choose to put my trust in a privately owned media outlet instead of a goverment . 
  i was not trying to change / u/cbfw86 opinion . 
  the guardian ( while of course being a company and seeking to maximize profit ) is a reputable news source . 
  their income depends on being reputable and they would loose a big chunk of their reader base if it was demonstrated that they lied about or skewed with facts and events ( and this has yet to happen iirc . ), 
  in addition to that , i personally believe that some journalists writing there have a sense of duty . 
  just like i trust my doctor to be beyond pushing an agenda , i trust those journalists . 
  my dad says that we had an autobianci ( i do n't know much about cars and if it is comparable to a trabant mechanically . ), 
  national elections are not the only source of political power . 
  kke has power elsewhere too . 
   ... ordinary people in the us was getting introduced to joys of consumption society already in the early years of 20th century . 
  when ? 
  during the great depression ? 
   ... the best results that stalin got from ussr from energy production to iron/steel production pales in comparison to shear might of the us productive capacity the usa did not have to start from zero . 
  also , there were no nazis destroying everything in the usa ( fuck staling btw , he was of course an asshole and dictator . ), 
  i think that if you take the time to examine the other side of the argument , that russia was basically an agrarian economy when the usa was industrial before the turn of the century and how socialism ( with all its negative sides and bad implementation ) took that country from that and turned it into something that won the wwii , sent the first man and object to space and educated a land of millions you might see why i do n't think that socialism was * that * bad . 
  can you please back up your claims with sources ? 
  also : can you consider that you and me differ on what we would find desirable and good in a country/society ? 
  i think that material wealth is far less important than equaltiy . 
  i think it is more important for all to have houses than some ( even most ) to have big houses . 
  i want to live somewhere where i am happy and not somewhere where i am rich . 
  as far as material wealth goes , i think i would be happy with the kind of housing they had in the ddr ( i am currently living and working in germany and have seen how it looks like ) and a modern equalient of the trabant ( i have never driven one but some people still drive them here so i have seen some . ), 
  one silly old man with a flag is news there ? 
  all i can see is spikes after the revolution of 1917 . 
  also : why do figures stop on 1938 ? 
  and why are they are not compared to comparable countries that did not have socialism ? 
  i am too young to have been to the ddr . 
  i was born 3 years before it was dissolved . 
  i personally know people who lived there though . 
  if you choose to judge a socialitstic country based on the things a capitalistic country strives to have then of course you will always conclude what you just concluded . 
  i find it really impresive that there was no poverty or unemployment . 
  i was recently forced to move out of my country because of unemployment . 
  if i had the choice to stay in greece and drink shitty coffee for a few years i would make that choice with no second thought . 
  my parents moved to germany during the early 90ies ( that is where i grew up . ), 
  they had a car that was a lot worse then a trabant ( some kind of tiny fiat . ), 
  they could afford a two room ( not bedroom , room ) apartment . 
  even in a rich region like baden w. you had to stress about housing and getting fired . 
  let 's not judge a whole country on the availability of good coffee . 
  not all people are able to do that . 
  not all people who finish a university and certainly not all other people . 
  in the ddr this was basically true for everyone . 
  everyone gets a house and a job . 
  disclaimer : i am very critical of the police state that was ddr and i think that states like this ( in the long run ) retarded the worlds progress towards socialism , but in all fairness , it was not hell on earth and certainly better than many `` free '' capitalistic countries today . 
  oh really ? 
  so are the members of cdu http://www.bpb.de/politik/grundfragen/parteien-in-deutschland/42076/zusammensetzung-der-cdu and spd http://www.bpb.de/politik/grundfragen/parteien-in-deutschland/42076/zusammensetzung-der-cdu and the greens have somewhat ( 10 years ) younger members http://www.bpb.de/politik/grundfragen/parteien-in-deutschland/42166/zusammensetzung-b90-gruene surprize surprize , you have to be old to get stupid enough to join a party . 
  i have two marxist `` friends '' ( they are twice my age and friends of my dad ) who used to live in the ddr . 
  one is very critical of how the ddr was structured , the lack of political freedom etc. 
  the other thinks it was heaven . 
  communists are very polarized about how the ddr was . 
  my argument is that many young people miss things in `` the good days '' of the ddr like the education http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/education_in_east_germany social welfare ( warning : ancient site ... ) http://econc10.bu.edu/economic_systems/economics/command_econ/consumer/comec_cons_egermany.htm zero unemployment and no poverty http://gowans.wordpress.com/2009/10/25/democracy-east-germany-and-the-berlin-wall/ this old interview of a 30 year old at the spiegel ( of all places ) sums up the opinion many ( not all , not the majority , but many ) younger people think of the ddr . 
  http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/homesick-for-a-dictatorship-majority-of-eastern-germans-feel-life-better-under-communism-a-634122.html his comment : `` in the past there was the stasi , and today ( german interior minister wolfgang ) sch\u00e4uble -- or the gez ( the fee collection center of germany 's public broadcasting institutions ) -- are collecting information about us . '', 
  used to sound ridicoulus back then , eh ? 
  ninja edit : let me add that i am very critical of the ddr as well . 
  i do n't think it is selective memory . 
  many younger people ( 40ish ) that i have met think that east germany had some very good qualities as a country . 
  i guess that this is technically true . 
  not cypriot greek . 
  i guess that this is true for most of the country . 
  [ here you go . 
  ] ( http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/united-kingdom/eu-knew-greece-cooked-its-books-when-it-joined-eurozone-243927.html ) also , everyone in greece knew . 
  i remember my dad talking about it when we joined . 
  the numbers were so nonsensical that anybody with half a brain could know . 
  [ you would not even need forensic accouting for it . 
  what is not said often enough is that eu leadership knew that the greek numbers were fake . 
  they wanted us in anyway . 
  well , i guess you are right that it is semantics . 
  my view on this is that since the game is played in legal terms we should analyse it that way as well ( but we should waste time on that , see below . ), 
  for me the question is that if for whatever reason germany ( for example ) was excluded from borrowing money from the market would it be able to service its debts and pay pensions/wages ? 
  of course you can argue that greece was not excluded from the markets for `` whatever reason '' , something which is a reasonable , non-trivial thing to say and according to my opinion what should be talked about in this thread . 
  that being said . 
  semantics have a strong psychological effect on how markets behave . 
  the fact that the facade ( and yes you are right it is a facade ) that what happened economically can be/will be fixed stood is the reason we did n't see greece going argentina . 
  yeah , i forgot about that . 
  the reason i did so is because it was a sideeffect of reconstructing the debt and not because of the inabiltiy of the state to pay .

  i really ca n't see how two decades of subpar goverment economic policy renders a nation as lazy and stupid . 
  i think casual observers possess the thinking elements that enable them to rationally conclude to the fact that it is impossible for 10 million people simultaneously to be lazy and stupid .
