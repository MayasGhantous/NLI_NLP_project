  we know that some greek people from peloponnese migrated to corsica . 
  there is in fact a widely known consirancy theory , believed exclusively by sheeps , that napoleon was greek . 
  sultan erdo\u011fan will ban you :p, 
  i focus on the fact that capitalism saved my country , contrary to the balkan/eas . 
  european countries . 
  we can analyze as much as you want the civil war but the result is and will be the same , greece not a country with communism . 
  yes and i mentioned it on my un-edited post , but i thought that none would read all those things i wrote so i cut them off . 
  when i visited prague and learned this i was shocked af :d . that city had a church wherever i looked . 
  greece did better than east europe/balkan countries cause it was n't a country with communism . 
  directly or not it benefited gr by beeing a capitalist country . 
  the term iron curtain is not widely known in greece , we use eastern bloc more . 
  we got help from the us because we resisted the communist party . 
  the same would happen in any other eastern european/balkan country that would do the same , since the us wanted to prevent cumminism in europe, 
  i found it funny after visiting prague that most people there were n't christians.this place was full of churches . 
  i always thought that the decline of the main religious group 's was due to cummunism , but after watching `` this table '' that seems to be not the case . 
  well greece was poor too , but thnx to capitalism it dd n't remain on the same level unlike most eastrn european countries/balkans . 
  thats almost contradicting lol, 
  you count them , because european is too general . 
  for ex . 
  i 'm european i 'm white but so is a spaniard \u2022 we are n't the same and our european `` bond '' is n't strong , thus to identify better we are specific . 
  i saw that there are about 30 million people with iresh ancestry in the united states ( !, 
  ) , but this high figure is because of the slavery is n't it ? 
  / u/hawkuk what did you vote bremain or brexit ? 
  in greece people-especially the youth - love to troll lidl.there are in fact many jokes about lidl . 
  for ex . 
  : oven from lidl , because you have always been wondering what happened to chernobyl . 
  i thought most hungarians can speak russian - at least the older generation - , is n't that true ? 
  sorry for off topic ques . 
  i can confirm only muslims for greece ( and there is sure a connection with the ottoman era ... ) . 
  i do n't think people care so much about race and jews well the last ones are kinda stereotypes here as `` filthy rich '' . 
  finally a map where czechs give a fuck about something < 3, 
  lol that square has the christmas spirit :p . good luck with your master degree btw !!, 
  seems like the weather 's gone crazy in germany ... and yes my country during summer is a living nightmare ( at midday mostly though ) , god bless `` air-condition '' and beaches hehehe . 
  czechia is waaaay better . 
  hell it even passed greece which was n't communist ( of course post crisis , but still impressive ) . 
  hmmm i meant it 's cool meaning it 's a nice place but i guess it 's cold too . 
   i actually really dislike it when the temperatur goes over 25 \u00b0 c and i ca n't go to a lake or a sea . 
  agreed.period . 
  latvian humour ... 
  i googled your city btw it 's cool !, 
  so at summer do you go at the ocean/seas ? 
  is it ok or too cold to swim ? 
  xd weird questions but i do n't know ... 
  are there beaches in germany where you can swim ? 
  that 's not too much i think . 
  take that rest of the balkans/easterns we are south : pp / s, 
  they disgust me . 
  instead of getting an education and work as most humans they always end up doing a bunch of kids to get money from the state . 
  at christmas they dress their kids as santa and make them sing to get money , while others cut parts of their kids bodys to `` hit '' the feeling and ask for money from people . 
  i do n't know about other governments but ours have tried multiple times to intergate them to our society but they wo n't . 
  most recently a law is about to be passed which will allow them to enter `` tei '' ( practical school ) without taking national exams . 
  for some reason i thought sweden would be on top of that . 
  anyway romania should get an mtv show !, 
  nothing asides it is poor . 
  that 's why i 'm reading the comment nr !, 
   well actually actually ily, 
  i 'm coming to find you !, 
  just kidding , cool pic seems quiete . 
  omggg the stats are from 2010 and although i get your point it sucks cause my country had already started to go brokeeeeeeeeeee, 
  congrats germany !!!!!, 
  i said this  greek civiliazation the first european confirmed once again ;p and he says that i say this  greeks were the `` first europeans '' ( then he backs up what he says without source ) anyway , it 's just a reddit comment section i 'm not going to discuss about justice lol . 
  chill . 
  80 percent of the greek population sounds weird if it did n't want to join something that the defender in did n't prove wrong . 
  the first turkic invasion was indeed justified and it was beneficial even for greece . 
  i do n't want to further comment it though because it gets out of thread . 
  i want to point out that greece-cyprus was n't a representative example , that 's all . 
  i do n't get why it 's `` partly true '' i said they `` wanted `` not `` want '' . 
  just a small correction which does n't change your point but i want to say it . 
  greece and cyprus ( ) wanted to unite and they still would if we ddnt have the fear of turkey . 
  our countries work together we send military in cyprus there is a special condition that helps greeks/cypriots enter education in each country respectively etc. 
  the quoted text show that he contradicts and he did n't get what i was trying to say yet he made a whole text to tell me what `` actually is true '' . 
  i replied that way cause he subconsciously ditched me . 
  uhm since you are an adult and '' i 'm the kid '' you should n't spend time at all ... 
  i get that catalonians feel different but the spanish constitution recognize it and doens ' t oppress anyone . 
  so why do you want independence ? 
  does it have to do with economy ? 
  do n't worry , you were busy climbing trees / s, 
  yes !, 
  i wo n't say too much because it 's only a google away from you but i 'll recommend you the top things ( according to me ) : 1 ) make sure to visit `` mikro kai megalo seitani '' in greek '' \u039c\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u03a3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b9 '' . 
  in this area there are two beaches where you have to walk about 3.5 km to reach the `` megalo seitani '' , the small is closer , less than 3.5 km walking . 
  because a friend of mine was n't fit at all i did n't go there thus the bad description ; / . 
  2 ) [ the waterfalls ] ( https://www.google.gr/search?biw=1455&amp;bih=722&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=samos+waterfalls&amp;oq=samos+waterfalls&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0.348034.350136.0.350285.16.9.0.0.0.0.310.1175.2-1j3.4.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..12.4.1173...0i30k1j0i24k1j0i10i24k1.q2iafww_i2q#imgrc=c8qvblum_0kjbm: ) do n't try to climb this one it 's slippery and i saw many tourists and locals fall xd . . [ instead take the kinda scary stairs ] ( https://www.google.gr/search?biw=1455&amp;bih=722&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=samos+waterfalls&amp;oq=samos+waterfalls&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0.348034.350136.0.350285.16.9.0.0.0.0.310.1175.2-1j3.4.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..12.4.1173...0i30k1j0i24k1j0i10i24k1.q2iafww_i2q#imgrc=mhjdjq8ot9suam: ) and you will end up in a bigger waterfall which is cool !, 
  again there will be some walking to all theese :d but tons tons tons of nature , you 'll love it !, 
  ( oh and i forgot to say that in the waterfalls there is n't heat because there are many trees but take a hat or something ) 3 ) if you have kids there is a beach called `` psili ammos '' that is n't deep and kids can walk ( and run and play ) !, 
  like jesus . 
  4 ) this beach is also a major tourist attraction [ `` tsampou '' ] ( https://www.google.gr/search?q=%ce%a0%ce%b1%cf%81%ce%b1%ce%bb%ce%af%ce%b1+%ce%a4%cf%83%ce%ac%ce%bc%cf%80%ce%bf%cf%8d&amp;stick=h4siaaaaaaaaaongfuluz9u3sdrlnjrt4tfp1zc0tcyxme0ythremmct8plhpwgp1elrtl5jjocsdclklevnccjpdk0oymlmziwr8uli8mlptizjzm8tkuhiluiypsegxc2f4eopkhhxbr5pebnvrryr0bli_npw_ej8-z0igvv3dn_qlfnpzqmajsjrviwaaaa&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjapq6l-ctvahvdwsykhf_qbteq_auicigb&amp;biw=1455&amp;bih=722#imgrc=tvxcagkn-qvltm: ) i did not mention all the churches because since i visited most of my country i 'm sick of them lol . 
  lol that inferiority complex though . 
  grow up . 
  i said this  greek civiliazation the first european confirmed once again ;p not this  greeks were the `` first europeans ''  greeks were the first farmers , the first readers , the first philosophers , and the first empires in europe - that is plenty of awesomeness enough !, 
  and according to your text ... . . lol ... 
  what does genes that appear in some areas has to do with this ? 
  do you claim that greeks are n't european ? 
  the next thin i expect u to do is claim that `` actually greek people are black and the word europe comes from spanish people '' . 
  greek civiliazation the first european confirmed once again ;p, 
  odysseussss do n't worry i was there 2 years ago and i think you will enjoy it . 
  it has so much nature and beach and waterfalls . 
  have fun odysseus . 
   you know who wants to stop muslim immigration ? 
  me lol . 
  the rest are still valid and i would agree .
