  they have been there for a long time and since ataturk times they got freed , meaning they are equal citizens . 
  plus , they have common religion . 
  i 'm gay and i did n't think that ;(, 
  `` as a black woman '' fuck off that 's not america . 
  better beeing black than armenian or greek that time in turkey . 
  except those alliens ~ ~ fins , hungarians , fakenordicsestonians ~ ~ . 
  i ca n't stand this catholic serb / s, 
  said in a germanic language / s, 
  there are more european people who speak turkish as their first langue than europeans who speak greek as first langue lol . 
   if ya go there , first immpresion when i see this is '' awesome landscape looks kinda like american cowboy film . 
  then sees your comment . 
  i thought that the world has only 7 million ? 
  i can agree to a point however today they do n't have that kind of power ( speaking about west only ) . 
  even in the u.k. the royal family brings more profit to the country than damage and they have a positive impact on the british society . 
   what a fucked up inbred world we live in . 
  can you be more specific ? 
  is that a troll comment ? 
  in case it 's serious no there wo n't be any earthquake ... 
  belgium we share the same birthday year !!!, 
  : `` d btw who are all these people ? 
  i live in w. greece that is marked as 0.5 and indeed earthquakes are quiete often occuring . 
  however most of them are not high in volume so not a big deal . 
  in my country it 's not rare but it 's not the rule either . 
  you ll probably see both and i think that 's the case in turkey too ( western at least have n't been to eastern ) that 's why i thought that the guy who replied was lying xd . 
  i mean who asks if you are truly turkish because of his eyes lol . 
  i doubted the things he claimed happened until i saw that comment . 
  i guess people can be ignorant , just like i was because i was doubtful . 
  blue eyes are n't special at all here too . 
  rarer of course however if you go out there is 0 possibility you wo n't see one . 
  if you 're lucky enough you 'll see me too lel ( jk ) . 
  john stamos , jenifer aniston and zack galifianacis are some examples and incidentally enough the only american greeks i instantly can think of . 
  assuming it was greek it would n't . 
  greeks themselves considered everything from asia minor and on to the east as asia . 
  a big part would be considered asian however as a whole greek culture is european . 
  hell if it was n't for us the continent would n't even be called europe . 
  the eu did some sanctions to russia back in 2014 in response to the crimean annexation . 
  if someone dies that 's a problem whether he is pole or asian . 
   you ca n't say `` muslims '' are lazy . 
  i wish we could judge them as individuals and not as a group ... 
  as south as you go people are generally having more melanin in their skin because the sun is aggressive . 
  we need to stop beeing racist but acknowledge that we arent the same but equal . 
  claiming that arabs are white is n't true at all . 
  i think beeing constantly bullied makes you weak . 
   emergerd you ca n't be turkish  because islam makes you browner . 
  pick one .

  yes otherwise my kid will be gay / s edit : in greece there was a stereotype that children become gay because they do n't have a manly figure to look up to . 
  i thought that existed in other countries too but looks like it was probably only a greek thing . 
  i 'm greek too and as far af i know people who favor junta also think that we are beeing hit by sprays of airplanes to be loyal to the americans . 
  source ? 
  yeah the [ pogrom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/istanbul_pogrom ) in constantinople ... west friendly . 
  yes turkey ally . 
  i like [ western friendly tax - until 1944 such an adherent of value ! - ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/varl%c4%b1k_vergisi ) . 
  and it happened ... 
  this actually reminds me of those pics of iran during the 70s . 
  i feel like anything is possible . 
  things like this is the reason i want t learn photoshop so bad ;'d . 
  nice one !, 
  til !, 
  this map is so cool !, 
   if you do n't have all the evidence i do n't know why you formed an opinion this . 
  i do n't have enough evidence to claim both `` claimings '' . 
   my point is it 's always greeks and serb nationalists that hate albanians end of conversation . 
  reevaluate the people that actually hate albanians and you 'll be suprised in a good way . 
  the book does n't load and i did n't say that not trusting historians or linguists is the rule , i pointed some exceptions that make me sometimes not sure if it is something i can trust for everything . 
  asides that i am not a historian and i am not trying to convince anyone about anything . 
  i think that our sources are n't enough to support that albanians have been here for 3 milleniums , wo n't say anything on that since i replied about the original comments above and read your sources -_- . 
   funny it 's always serbs and greeks that think albanians came into the balkans in the middle ages , not tthe historians and linguists or others . 
  hmmm , really makes you think ... definitely no agenda there . 
  no agenda at all just you beeing racist , cunt , and possibly albanian lol . 
   because romans/greeks did n't write about it until 1284 means albanians did n't exist in the area until then ? 
  exactly or more accurate probably . 
   even though the language proves otherwise ? 
  linguisits also made a `` proper '' way to spell ancient greek and this obviously ca n't be proven to be correct so until more discoveries happen on this thread i ca n't form an opinion or claim that albanians have been here for 3 milleniums solely by linguists hell even indo-european langue and theory in general is disputed ... 
  30 loans is a low number lol . 
  it could happen in middle ages too you know since the greek languege stil existed in a specific form . 
  plus your first source does n't support that albanians have been for almost 3000 years in the balkans `` the first written mention of the albanian language was on 14 july 1284 in dubrovnik '' if it existed that long it would be written by greeks or romans . 
  hell we wrote about the moravians that are way far from us , we would definetely write for this if it existed in ancient times since we are so close . 
  theres a big void about albania and the claim about the branch is n't widely accepted since it is n't verified that it did exist in that times . 
  xddddddd, 
   however , there 's no question that albanians have been for almost 3000 years in the balkans how is there no question since you did not post a proof ? 
   the greeks and romans could n't care less about the barbarians of the balkans , so the information on them is scant . 
  yeah if it were n't about the greek and roman historians we would n't know about any of them lol . 
  asides that i generally agree with what you said . 
  i wish the nazis invaded turkey and we would get back our lost terittories from ww1 xd . 
  anyway i do n't care of this land nowdays but stil `` orgasm for a greek ~ ~ nationalist ~ ~ patriot '' . 
  you did n't provide a good example . 
  his point is stil valid . 
  the aus ~ ~ t ~ ~ r ~ ~ al ~ ~ ian user implies that the joke is n't actually a joke : pp / s. 
  i 'm confused . 
  australia is n't in the eu . 
  `` magna grecia '' carries our curse . 
  nice to know that it is informative , thank you !,
