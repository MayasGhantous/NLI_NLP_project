capital controls have become less strict so things are improving slowly . 
  we have new elections now and syriza will most probably win again . 
  we are expecting a bank restructuring at the end of the year which will help a lot . 
  and a debt restructuring sometime in the near future . 
  because we have democracy and the people choose their leaders through elections . 
  you ca n't have a foreign government come to you and say `` now we rule you , your home is now ours , you obey to us cause you have debts '' . 
  if you do that the people will fight to free themselves . 
  and then most probably the losses will be far more than what you were trying to to get in the first place ( for both sides ) . 
  countries are not companies . 
  you ca n't sell a country to pay off debts . 
  i think you are very narrow-minded and cruel , almost like a sociopath . 
  you need to feel more . 
  money is n't god . 
  if the majority of people were thinking like you , the world would be true hell . 
  oh god , not again . 
  more like `` mediocre . '', 
  [ indeed it was a fascinating ride for tsipras . 
  [ how i felt watching today 's eurogroup members interviews about greece . 
  the banks and the atm as well , are closed at the moment . 
  soon the atm will open for the public with a 60 euro cap everyday . 
  the majority of people that are in trouble are the elders who have no credit card and do not use atm to withdraw money . 
  everything else goes on as usual . 
  let me clarify this : tsipras 's call for a referendum is ** not ** about staying in eurozone or not . 
  it is about the latest eurogroup proposal , do we accept it or not ? 
  1 ) if we ** do ** , they will sign it , but more cuts will come to pensions and salaries , the vat will increase etc etc. 
  2 ) if we ** do n't ** , they will use that as a lever to demand a better deal from eurogroup . 
  interesting notes : merkel wants the referendum to be about staying in euro or not . 
  also the other greek political parties that signed all the memorandums in the past are already using propaganda and fear to scare people to make them believe that the referandum is about euro and not about the latest proposal . 
  i really hope it does n't work . 
  thank you for your kind words and for your help . 
  i do n't know how to speak german and i heard that you need to know german to work in berlin . 
  i have a few greek friends in canada , i agree that it is a lovely community . 
  they made some differences , they keep arresting people for tax evasion and for corruption . 
  they brought back staff that was illegally fired from their jobs by the previous government , they re-opened the public tv channels etc. 
  but mainly they express the opinion of the majority of greek people that they ca n't handle any more austerity . 
  where is `` here ? '', 
  i will certainly leave if we have a grexit or a default . 
  i want to try to stay a bit more to see where this thing will lead us . 
  also greece is a place that has people with good hearts , with beautiful lands and its very sunny with many seas and mountains . 
  its difficult to let go of such a beauty so easy . 
  i will leave only at the very last moment . 
  heh you are correct , it sucks , those 5 months went by without an actual deal but i want to hope it all happened for a good reason , i mean if we can get at mondays emergency summit a good deal maybe it will all be worth it . 
  else the next months will be even more painful , mostly for us . 
  * fingers crossed *, 
  i agree that maybe romania has/had a worse quality of life compared to greece and not only romania but a lot of other countries too , but its worse if you had a good quality of life that kept rising for one or two decades and suddenly you are back to 1980 salaries . 
  most young people leave greece cause they grew up with a good quality of life and nothing missing in their lives , and now they ca n't afford most basic stuff . 
  so those left behind are stuck with high unemployment , with the old people and a pension system that needs to be reformed as soon as possible because it is not sustainable without the youth to work for it . 
  as a 27 year old greek , i lived both situations . 
  while i was growing up my parents could afford everything , a good car , a decent apartment , vacations , full grocery bags . 
  but as time went by around 2006 + suddenly they started cutting salaries , jobs started to shrink , people were fired , groceries got more expensive and every price became higher and higher . 
  today we ca n't afford a good car , we ca n't afford an apartment , i have no job because most computer science companies shut down or moved abroad , the groceries became even more expensive with the taxes . 
  so now we went back to 1980 . 
  imagine if that happened to your people how would you feel ? 
  thats why syriza was elected , to put an end to this spiral of doom with lower salaries and lower salaries and while having biggger and bigger taxes and product prices . 
  1 ) depends on the age of the apartment and its extra stuff but for the basic around 300-400 euros . 
  2 ) again it depends on the type of device you use to heat . 
  for water radiators its very expensive so most people started using electricity for heating which is a trap and its far more expensive , like 1000-2000 euro electricity bill . 
  ( i made that mistake as well ) so that leaves wood burning stoves which are really cheap but not that healthy around 250 euro for a whole winter . 
  3 ) again ... it depends on the type of food . 
  one pasta 500g costs 0.60 euro and 1 kilo of chicken breast costs 5 euro . 
  important relevant article info -  [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqihaepq_ly] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqihaepq_ly ), 
  the truth is in the middle . 
  neither party was/is innocent . 
  but the need for europe / greek changes is really urgent at the moment . 
  or there is a hole in the boat , meaning europe lacks the mechanisms and structures needed for today crisis and greece is paying the price but at the end the boat sinks and takes it with them ? 
  the current government ( syriza ) is by far the most supported currently by the greek people . 
  there are no alternatives political parties at the moment . 
  so there is no reason for a greek election anytime soon . 
  however a referendum is something different ... . 
  slide 9 : elements of an agreement -- immediate reforms basis for a new covenant between greece and europe fiscal , vat & pension reforms dynamically/intertemporally consistent fiscal plan for the 2015-2020 period a revamped vat system with two rates ( e.g. 
  one at 6.5 % for basic goods , books , pharmaceuticals and another at 15 % for everything else ) , with the addition of : ( a ) a 3 % surcharge for tax transactions on goods/services at the higher rate ) , and ( b ) a provision for vat returns in the case of permanent residents of islands currently benefitting from a 30 % reduction in vat ( so as to render the change vat-rate neutral for those remote idlands ) significant curtailment of early retirements and mergers of pension funds slide 9 : elements of an agreement -- beyond june new institutions independent , self-governing irs-like tax commission ( under the aegis and supervision of parliament ) development bank : utilisation of public property through a combination of privatisation and collateralisation of public assets , in the context of setting up the new development bank bank asset management company : utilising the remaining part of the hfsf 's capital , bamc would help manage the banking sector 's non-performing loans so as to de-clog the circuits of credit out-of-court workout tribunals , that help bypass the arteriosclerotic judicial process of dealing with disputes on tax arrears and npls . 
  growth and recovery initiatives public debt management that improves debt sustainability and brings market access closer , involving : esm purchases on behalf of ecb-help smp-program ggbs ( 27 billion approximately ) . 
  thus greece benefits from the long esm maturities ( that help send these short-term repayments to the future ) and allows it to participate in the ecb 's qe smoothening out of lumpy efsf-loan repayments during 2022-2025 , through suitable maturity extensions linking repayments to glf and efsf loans to nominal gdp growth a new investment package by the eib in collaboration with the new development bank , the ebrd , kfw etc. 
  a comprehensive anti-poverty ten year program , in collaboration with the european commission conclusion let us for a moment imagine the effect of the announcement of such an agreement on greece 's financial , fiscal and social security ecosystem : with the shares of the banks skyrocketing , our state 's losses from their recapitalisation will be extinguished as its equity in them appreciates and pension funds are refloated by the dividends from the devbank and the contributions of newly formalised and employed workers . 
  suddenly , a society mired in debt-deflation and rendered unreformable by a reform agenda that was rejected by the majority will be on the mend and ready to embrace as their own the reforms that we are all striving to agree upon . 
  so , my question is : what do you believe ladies and gentlemen is in europe 's best interests ? 
  what would help europe consolidate in the future ? 
  a greek and european failure to implement this blueprint , leading us all to a dystopian , uncharted territory ? 
  or the successful implementation of our blueprint ? 
  i shall leave it to you to decide . 
  for my part , i shall conclude with what i consider to be triptych of dangerous myths that is putting the eurozone , and of course , greece in great peril : a greek exit from the eurozone may be good for the eurozone , and even for greece greece has not done enough during the last five years and insists on having other nations , some of them poorer than itself , pay for its profligacy the new greek government has not negotiated in good faith , has tabled no serious proposals to the institutions , and has no credible plan for helping the greek economy stand on its own two feet within the eurozone . 
  none of the above is correct . 
  a greek failure , even if it is at first contained by an activist european central bank , will render the eurozone similar to the mid-war gold standard : a hard money fixed exchange rate regime that jettisons economies bearing the greatest burden of adjustment . 
  once this realisation enters hearts and minds , it is only a matter of time before the eurozone will fragment with enormous costs for every european nation . 
  as for greece , a forced exit will cause the pauperisation of another million greeks -- as if the current poverty crisis is insufficient !, 
  the notion that greece has not done enough to consolidate its public finances is non-sense . 
  as we saw no economy has consolidated more in peacetime during the last three centuries . 
  moreover , greece is running a primary surplus and the new greek government is committed to a deficit brake that will ensure that it does not slip back into a primary deficit . 
  thus the claim that the greek state requires loans in order to pay for its salaries and pensions is simply wrong . 
  the greek government has been arguing since at least the 20th february 2015 eurogroup agreement for immediate implementation of a number of important reforms . 
  i am happy to confirm that much progress has now been made here in brussels in this regard . 
  lastly , the blueprint you kindly gave me the opportunity to outline today lays out a plan for investment-led recovery based on wide-ranging socio-economic reforms that enhance liberty , justice , shared prosperity and the idea that democracy can turn a vicious into a virtuous cycle . 
  in 2010 our failures took a toll on europe . 
  if we succeed together in this project , a different process may unfold , with greece being the harbinger of good things to come across europe . 
  slide 4 : looking forward-investment imagine a development bank levering up collateral comprising the equity the state shall retain after privatisations as well as other assets ( e.g. 
  real estate ) whose value can be easily enhanced ( and collateralised ) through reforming their property rights . 
  imagine that it links up the european investment bank , the juncker plan etc. 
  with greece 's private sector . 
  privatisation suddenly escapes any association with fire sales and becomes part of a grand developmental public-private partnership . 
  slide 5 : looking forward-banks imagine further a bad bank that helps the banks shed their legacy non-performing mortgages and unclog their financial plumbing .
