  / r/anormaldayinrussia i 'll just leave this right here, 
  i 'm worried about one thing though , what happens if parents are so adamant about getting their children circumsized that they start trying to do it themselves if it ends up being illegal and a good number of them end up harming them in the process ? 
  i mean it does require certain skill to perform without injury right ? 
  maybe some doctors will start taking circumcision cases illegally but then there would n't be any way to certify their skill or prevent families from being scammed and stuff making it illegal does n't seem like a good way to deal with it to me cause it just opens up another can of worms, 
  and if you hate your boss , you can park it next to his car so it will `` accidentally '' shit on its hood, 
  in case you were wondering , the greek feta world war 's battle of canada [ has been won ] ( http://news.yahoo.com/europe-greece-wins-feta-cheese-battle-canada-162045568.html ) :p next battlefield : united states of america, 
  i know what you mean those damn tombstones where really asking for it, 
  / r/europecirclejerk is this way, 
  woah , a chart of something bad that my country is last for a change, 
  we 'll pacify them with our relaxed way of life and winning personality, 
  its a shame we do n't get to play against each other , beating portugal never gets old ^ ^ we 'll ^ ^ never ^ ^ let ^ ^ you ^ ^ forget, 
  i remember my mom telling me the same thing , she said they had a saying `` sell kid , buy datsun '' , meaning they would sell their babies to people that could n't have their own and they would buy a truck with that money now whether it 's true or not i have no idea , it just seems relevant enough to mention, 
  so what you 're saying is you used to write in [ unown ] ( http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100413020652/clubpenguinfanon/images/f/fa/the_unown_hereby_decree.png ) ? 
  an online friend i had from denmark told me he was actually getting paid to be a student , it sounded pretty cool to me , do you still have that ? 
  when eagles cry, 
  nah we have cyprus, 
  i vote for gyroman , his special power is to summon and eat delicious food then pass on unpaid debts to the next generation he can also fuse with the serbian superhero pe\u010denjeman to create the super saiyan pe\u010denjyroman , whose special power is to remove kebab from the balkans, 
  the greek way to happiness : step 1 : grab your family/friends and go to a good [ taverna ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taverna ) step 2 : get some meat ( gyros , lamb , steak , chicken , kokoretsi , souvlaki , whatever you want ) obligatory step 3 : [ greek salad ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_salad ) step 4 : profit !, 
  there is no ??? 
  step here , this is guaranteed to solve all your life 's problems well ... until you have to pay anyway edit : i just realized i forgot to mention drinks , so make this step 3.5 : order your favorite alcoholic drink and since i 'm editing this anyway i suppose my choice would be steak with some wine , a greek salad and some fries if they do n't come with the steak ( it depends on the taverna but mostly they do ), 
  i am , i always have a glass of water on my desk when i 'm using the computer ^ that ^ movie ^ was ^ so ^ bad, 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.fimes.gr/wp-content/uploads/mixaloliakos-gagnam-style2.jpg ), 
  there 's some ( old ) people in greece that wish we still had a king , the last one we had was in power until the early 1970s when the military junta fell , some of those people will also tell you they want the junta back too , it 's stupid but you do hear old people saying `` we need the junta back '' sometimes \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  we also need to deliver the message that nobody is above the law , you ca n't just do whatever you want gd was directly involved with the murder of an innocent person , we ca n't just let them get away with it because they 're a political party , if we do that then there is nothing stopping them from killing 10 people next time , we need to stop this shit now before it becomes even worse, 
  do what you think is best , you know better than me about your situation , i just said that in case you did n't know about it, 
  you do n't have to stay for military service , you can leave now and not have to do it , if you return to greece later you can pay off some months of your time so that you do only 4-5 months ( i do n't know the minimum ) , and i think if you 're old enough you do n't have to go at all, 
  i lost it at the james bond shit, 
  a table with a lot of food on it , salads , meat , some ouzo or something, 
  thank you , people are too busy trying to point out the difference between left wing and right wing extremism and they forget that it does n't really matter where you belong as long as you are a piece of shit that does harm to others because they do n't agree with you, 
  if you come to greece in the summer like that then you will be more white than most people because of sunburn, 
  ** greece ** [ on telecoms ] ( http://www.on.gr/en/products/residential/double_play/on_double_play_24gr.html?category=double_play ) marketed speeds : 24/1 mbps [ what i get , straight from the router ] ( http://i.imgur.com/brwaxtz.jpg ) 30 euros/month it 's a double play connection , meaning its not just internet , i get unlimited free phone calls to people in greece and reduced charge to other countries , there are faster speeds than 24/1 , some companies offer vdsl that 's up to 50mbps download for the same price as i am paying now , but i ca n't get it where i live so i am stuck with this, 
  some say that it was really important to germany 's eventual defeat because the battle of greece and the battle of crete delayed operation barbarossa ( the russian campaign ) by 6 weeks , pushing it closer to the winter i do n't know if we 're just trying to make ourselves feel better or it really affected the outcome of that fight but i 'm proud of my country 's actions nevertheless, 
  so true , i 've gotten really spoiled and do n't drink anything but wine ( well i drink champagne in new years and celebrations ) , my uncle makes his own red wine and he actually locks the barrel when me and my cousin are celebrating birthdays, 
  we also beat italy when they tried to [ invade us ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greco-italian_war ) in 1940 , it was really important cause during that time the axis was looking like they were going to win the war and a small nation like greece standing against them and actually winning showed that they can be beat , it is n't really known because of all the battles that happened during world war 2 but we got our 15 mins of fame through some churchill quotes and [ swedish power metal songs ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtax3fl-uzo ) of course it did n't last long since [ musolini pussied out and called the germans ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_greece ) , at which point the enemies were just too many and the uk could n't send enough help so greece fell in about a month , still we put up a fierce resistance and hitler was impressed so he ordered that every prisoner the german army had taken must be [ released immediately ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_greece#homages_to_the_resistance ) , i suppose that 's something right ? 
  generally i 'd say as a people we always were pretty good at war , but there 's only 11 million of us so i do n't know how much it matters if , say , world war 3 breaks out tomorrow, 
  step 1 : wrap a kebab in pita bread , just like you would a normal gyro step 2 : put anything else you want in the gyro like fries , tomatoes , tzatziki sauce , onions , ketchup , mustard , carrots , etc , gyros are really flexible with what you can add to them step 3 : ??? 
  [ actually ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mongol_invasion_of_rus' ) the jihadists have no chance though, 
  growth is too mainstream for us, 
  it 's the reapers , it 's always the reapers, 
  i 'm more worried about all the criminals in the us government and its `` defense '' programs, 
  you could say that guy had ... ( \u2022 _ \u2022 ) ( \u2022 _ \u2022 )  \u2310 \u25a0 - \u25a0 ( \u2310 \u25a0 _ \u25a0 ) balls of steel, 
  since you ca n't really tell by the map , [ here 's the greek one , and some others we used to have ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_emblem_of_greece ) the image on wiki is actually a transparent . png which means you can photoshop it on top of anything without screwing up the image with white in all the blank space it has , i did n't check any others but it 's probably the same , you can have fun with that, 
  people keep posting maps of europe like this and everybody forgets cyprus, 
  true , some free burgers would n't be that bad , too, 
  [ remember by disturbed ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaptzgtdweg ) , it 's not the kind of song they are known for which i guess is part of the reason i like it ? 
  gyromancer here , can confirm, 
  it has n't really affected my daily life much , other than the fact that i rarely eat out anymore but i notice it in other ways , like not going anywhere for holidays or when something breaks or stops working , you do n't have the spare money to replace it , etc then again i kinda have it easy cause i do n't consume anything addictive like coffee , cigarettes , alcohol or drugs , not even coca cola , i guess people that do will definitely have to cut down on those things , though i do n't consider that a bad thing honestly, 
  oh good , the loneliness was killing me / s, 
  [ history ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_civil_war ) has [ shown ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pelloponesian_wars ) that we only fight civil wars right after we finish a war with another country first , and sometimes maybe while we are in the [ middle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_civil_wars_of_1824\u20131825 ) of a war , so you 're out of luck unless you can get somebody to invade us first, 
  bad olive oil ? 
  that 's it , its on spain, 
  we stopped the persian empire , alexander started the macedonian empire , lots of contributions to science , mathematics , philosophy , theatre , art , etc but all that is second place , our greatest contribution to humanity is greek cuisine, 
  you guys were too drunk to come vote , so the russians beat you, 
  best beach i 've ever went to , it 's just an amazing place , lost one of my sandals to the sea cause i 'm an idiot though xd, 
  that 's when sites like this come in handy http://10minutemail.com/10minutemail/index.html, 
  i do n't pay much much attention to sports in my country but i know there was [ another black greek basketball player ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sofoklis_schortsanitis ) , who has taken shit from gd before , gd will shit talk just about everyone if it will get them attention, 
  you have just been banned from / r/murica, 
  i know it 's bad , i said it is did n't i ? 
  but junta is completely different just because i 'm not gon na go out on the streets and protest for an anarchist and suspected terrorist does n't mean i like it or that i think it should happen , i just ca n't sympathize with the guy, 
  the guy locked in is suspected of being in a [ terrorist organization ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conspiracy_of_fire_nuclei ) , during the junta you could go to prison because you wore something red and they took you for a communist things may be bad now but they are nowhere near as bad as then, 
  actually i 'm not sure if there 's any official system , but everyone just calls before 11-12 am morning , then midday until about 3-4 pm i guess and then its afternoon until darkness falls , of course the sun does n't set until its almost 9 pm here at this time of the year so i 'm not sure how that works, 
  as much as i would like for alternative solutions i can understand why that wo n't happen , i would n't want to pay for someone else 's debt either ... 
  that depends , are you a hot female tourist ? 
  well i do n't know if what they 're showing now is from brazil , i do n't watch them but i knew they had stuff like that before so i assumed the ones airing now are the same , due to the crisis there are almost no greek series being made anymore , so there are a lot of stuff from other countries , especially turkey and whatever countries the hispanophonic ( is that even a word ? ), 
  soap operas are from, 
  i hate how it takes a crisis like this to get anything done , but hopefully tourism and this will help the people, 
  kids ' movies , anime/cartoons and brazilian soap operas are dubbed , at least most of them , everything else is subtitled afaik, 
  your speed depends on the distance of your house to the [ dslam ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/digital_subscriber_line_access_multiplexer ) , unless you live really close to it you 're not going to get the speeds you are paying for , this is normal and it is n't like your isp is ripping you off by giving you less than what you pay for , it is the max they can give you the advertised price is the highest speeds you could possibly get with that plan , but the max speed that you will be getting depends on how far away you live from the source, 
  we use pegi for videogames , i have no idea if we have anything for movies , if we do i do n't think anyone cares cause i went to see lord of the rings the two towers and terminator 3 with a friend when i was like 10, 
  yes but you ca n't go online cause xbox live \u2122 is n't currently available in your locale . 
  sooooo , enjoy your free 24 hours !, 
  soooo , if everybody just shut up and said `` nah its k americans , feel free to spy on our citizens all you want '' that would be strength ? 
  strength is not the word i 'd use ... how about cowardice ? 
  the way to prevent teen pregnancies and stds is education and awareness , if nothing else porn only makes things worse if your only idea of sex is from porn , just teach them damn kids how to have safe sex , if parents are n't going to do it then school , you can have special classes or give away condoms or informational pamphlets or whatever , its nice to pretend sex is not a thing at high school and ignore the issue and all but at some point they 're gon na have to deal with it, 
  maybe they do n't think we 're important enough to spy on for the nsa :p, 
  now maybe but there are no wars between eu countries so we do n't need big armies , its just wasted money if a war starts there will surely be drafts and focus will change towards military spending , but yeah its beside the point what i mean is there is no reason to start a mini world war when everything is going so peacefully, 
  sure if the entirety of europe united for this america would lose but i do n't want to be `` collateral damage '' from drone # 245431 , i 'd rather we all just live and see if we can fix things differently, 
  the reason is simple , its not because it is in their mission to stand up for some other random broadcaster that got shut down , but in cases like these people need to help each other because who knows if at some point down the line the same thing is n't going to happen to them ? 
  if that time comes they sure would want support from others , its easier to convince people when the whole of europe is with you rather than if you 're alone , [ read this poem if you want cause i 'm not great at explaining things ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_they_came ... ), 
  sounds tasty, 
  oh plz no , we do n't need a war on peace, 
  is n't this kinda pointless anyway ? 
  i mean if someone wants to have sex with their pet how would the law know anyway ? 
  i mean unless you go online and say `` hello guys this is my pet dog bj\u00f8rn watch me have sex with him '' i fail to see how they would know what is happening in your home , unless they 've been taking lessons from the nsa or something though if bestiality porn production was n't banned then it will have to be now if the act itself gets banned, 
  aaaand we redditddos 'd it ( or at least i ca n't open it ), 
  * two days later * breaking news : reddit hands over information about users subscribed to or posted in / r/restorethefourth to the us government , official comment : we had no idea the us government existed, 
  not sure about that , they say that they do n't filter results based on what you like http://dontbubble.us/, 
  skype belongs to microsoft, 
  `` umm guys ... we accidentally the economy '', 
  greece would be that one guy that hits on all the women in the party , fucks the host 's girlfriend and runs away before anyone finds out , preferably also taking some of the food with him, 
  we have adsl ( up to 24/1 mbps ) and vdsl ( up to 50 mbps i think ) mostly , not many people have vdsl though cause you need to be really close to centre where you get the internet connection from for it to be effective , the prices are about the same at around 30-40 euros/month for unlimited internet and phone, 
  i know what you mean , i never had a problem cause i do n't overeat during the holidays but i know some people have to go to the hospital cause they just forget to stop , i think it 's silly and i do n't really feel sorry for them , i mean , if you go to the hospital for eating too much then you really had to try to do it, 
  as far as i know there are n't any videos of the assault but it was done publicly in front of many eyewitnesses so nobody can deny it happened i saw a video of him after the attack on tv , he was being held against the wall by two bodyguards and they were asking him if he was going to pull the gun out ( he can legally carry a gun cause of his mp status , though that 's probably been revoked after this ) , then they forcibly dragged him outside, 
  i have a bit of a hungover and ca n't really remember anything other than the incident with the golden dawn mp trying to punch a mayor a couple of days ago , the mayor 's bodyguard blocked him and he ended up hitting a 12 year old girl in the face this week was the holy week of the orthodox easter , that means no school or work for most people , after 00:00 fasting officially ends and people always go out to clubs and stuff , more car accidents than usual happen at this time cause some people just do n't want to take a taxi or want to show off or whatever stupid reason and just drive drunk , in the morning it is customary for families to gather and roast a lamb , usually that means gathering in a house with a backyard and roasting the lamb on a [ spit ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spit_\\ ( cooking_aide \\ ) ) , we 're doing this right now and in 2-3 hours it will be done , it takes a long time and if you do n't have a spit that rotates automatically you have to be rotating it manually the entire time, 
  on a similar note , a mp and the spokesperson of golden dawn once assaulted a female communist party mp publicly on live television and it ended up being great for their popularity, 
  so i guess i am the only one who got bosnia and herzegovina ? 
  time to stop eating gyros and eat some kebab, 
  who cares about europeans , we must save europe !,

  ok but what do i tell them about jesus and his family being 100 % greek or that the best universities in the world have only greek people ?
