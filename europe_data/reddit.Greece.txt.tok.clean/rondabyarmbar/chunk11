  i want to say greece , but i also do n't want to badmouth my country . . 
  btw , no reason to get salty about some internet comments . 
  if it messes your day , turn your pc off and do something else . 
  the world is not over and / r/europe is not what matters in this world . 
  cheers, 
   whilst having literally no reason for it . 
  i could name several reasons : traditional ( british ) unwillingness to support the eu 's common decisions , constant criticism of continental european countries for so called anti-british decisions , criticism of poorer eu countries ( romania , poland , greece ) , frequent us ( british ) vs them ( rest of eu ) rhetoric , historical reasons . 
  all that builds hate . . 
  honestly i could go on . 
  ( by the way i do not agree with those arguements , i 'm just presenting them )  i 'm honestly getting sick of how much `` fuck the u.k. '' sentiment we 're getting on this sub well , imagine how greeks felt/fell whenever we are mentioned . 
  or how turks or russians currently feel, 
  pretty sweet copper coffee set you have there !, 
  loukum ( loukoumi in greek ) also means sweet, 
  7 secs for normal dose , 10secs for a lungo, 
  yeah they do actually . . 
   asuracenturix he was called kakofonix in greek , which translates to badvoice-ix !, 
  and that 's basically why an eu army has no support in greece . 
  our main threat is turkey and the eu has done little to support us ( btw i do n't agree 100 % with this position , but that 's the mentality ), 
  if belgians dress manekken piss as a russian peeing prostitute to honor trump . . 
  i 'd be so happy, 
  we 've already shot down a few and no wars yet ;-) [ link ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/208734/article/ekathimerini/news/turkish-court-wants-trial-of-greek-pilot-for-allegedly-shooting-down-fighter-jet ) [ 2 ] ( https://theaviationist.com/2015/12/30/aegean-sea-dogfight/ ), 
  last normandy veteran . 
  very few greeks participated in d-day . 
  then . . have you welcomed baby jesus in your life brother ? 
   the amount of hipsters going into pagan religions is going on i 'm sorry . . 
   i mean , they are automatic my family made the mistake of switching to automatics many years ago . 
  the other side is very very comfortable :-(, 
  tarriffs to european cars will lead to counter measures i.e tarriffs to american cars . 
  also are n't there a bunch of european factories in the us ? 
  they will also be affected negatively and thus his initial plan of securing jobs will fail . 
   we burn as a sacrifice to the old gods !, 
   russians are christians . 
  your old gods did not help you in the past and they will not help you now . . ( / s sorry i could n't contain myself ), 
  the only list where greece is doing ok . . :-(, 
  i 'm pretty sure the eu is well protected from another greek crisis and not in the mood for another one of tsipras ' blackmails . 
  it 's a mystery here as well . 
  maybe he did it to gain some popular support because he has plans for early elections . 
  maybe he wanted to regain some lost votes from the islanders and pensioners ( they were supposed to receive those funds ) . 
  maybe he did it to reduce the complaints by his deputees . 
  maybe he wants some leverage on the eu - imf stand off . 
  maybe he 's a total idiot . . today , he announced to have a parliamentary vote on those measures , and the voting process will not be secret ( each deputee will publicly anounce his decision ) , in an attempt to blackmail the institutions and the opposition whom he accuses of being `` against the pensioners '' . 
  what 's even funnier it 's that the proposed measures , even if voted , would have a minimal effect , since the terms are very strict . . 
   that 's not feasible for greece , unless you want to start killing everyone who attempts to cross the border . 
  honestly , the refugees are/were coming from 3-4 islands - the ones closest to turkey . 
  these passages could be policed , rather efficiently . 
  nevertheless , even if we stop a refugee boat , we have to rescue them . 
  it 's a legal obligation . 
  unless we go full australia and turn them back , which is probably illegal, 
  where do you pay 3 euros for gyro ? 
  2.5 max, 
  yup a lot of them returned after the collapse and had some favourable laws voted for them e.g reduced military service , cheap property in northern greece . . during the recent stuff in crimea manyof them tried to get greek passports too, 
  greek . 
  why would we operate in english ? 
  meh . . putin could 've used more resources in harder times to actually achieved that . 
  in reality i do n't really think that this will have any actuall effect, 
  3rd + generation greeks still live in russia , ukraine etc. 
  very small population and not really close to greece really . 
  the budweiser fron cz is awesome . 
  i recommend it to everyone, 
  afaik the eu is pushing third states to treat all eu - members in the same manner, 
  greeks also kiss the left side first , unlike the rest of northern europe . 
  that perplexed me a lot during my master abroad, 
   elafonissos deer island for the rest i could n't find any info, 
  i think schauble said something similar to jack lew . 
  including the `` we can give you greece , if you give us puerto rico '', 
  nah , with syriza in gvt the rioters will stay at home, 
  hey at least we do n't mind stuffing our asses with things . 
  we 're not butt-phobics, 
   while their debt remains , payments will be suspended . 
  cool , but the debt still increases if it remains in euros and greece returns to drachmas . 
  the suspension of payments would actually be terrible when the debt rises, 
  same here , clearly a political prosecution which btw was sped up during syriza, 
  fyi : 1 ) if he was found guilty of faking the deficit in 2010 , that would mean that all the european agencies also faked their numbers and greece is not actually in crisis 2 ) after the latest trial ended , some members inside the courtroom yelled `` glory to greece '' ( zito i ellas ) 3 ) the troika demanded , and succeeded in forcing the greek gvt to pay georgiou 's legal fees in order to give the latest money tranche 4 ) the main accuser of georgiou is an ex stastitician who among other things considers `` greece to be under german occupation '' , `` that the deficit was n't as high and it was in fact one of the lowest in europe at 4-5 % '' and all off it was a deep plan of the europeans to control greeks [ sauce ] ( http://www.iefimerida.gr/news/87195/%cf%80%ce%bf%ce%b9%ce%ac-%ce%b5%ce%af%ce%bd%ce%b1%ce%b9-%ce%b7-%ce%b6%cf%89%ce%ae-%ce%b3%ce%b5%cf%89%cf%81%ce%b3%ce%b1%ce%bd%cf%84%ce%ac-%cf%80%ce%bf%cf%85-%ce%ad%cf%83%cf%84%ce%b5%ce%b9%ce%bb%ce%b5-%cf%84%ce%bf%ce%bd-%ce%b1%ce%bd%ce%b4%cf%81%ce%ad%ce%b1-%ce%b3%ce%b5%cf%89%cf%81%ce%b3%ce%af%ce%bf%cf%85-%cf%84%ce%b7%cf%82-%ce%b5%ce%bb%cf%83%cf%84%ce%b1%cf%84-%ce%b3%ce%b9%ce%b1-%ce%ba%ce%b1%ce%ba%ce%bf%cf%8d%cf%81%ce%b3%ce%b7%ce%bc%ce%b1 ), 
   it is not possible for a greek to be stripped of his greek citizenship it is very possible, 
  i could talk for ages about the smiles . . macron 's quirky / naughty smile , melania 's huge crest smile , brigitte 's awkard smile and donnald 's `` i 'm the boss here '' . . 
  overall a nice , undirected picture , which is rare for trump . 
  love it !, 
  p.s baise ouais is fuck yes ? 
  they do n't teach curse words in french class :-(, 
   people throwing grenades at their mother-in-laws ca n't blame them fam . . 
  nato ? 
  more like no to imf ? 
  more like i 'm not f who ? 
  more like who cares i think i have a few more, 
  very dangerous to drive as well , especially while on motorcycles edit : crap syntax, 
  strange . . we in the south close our shops in the winter . . 
   well she is serbian . 
  you 've never been to serbia have you ? 
  merkel wore that light green jacket when she visited greece in 2014 [ source ] ( http://www.tovima.gr/politics/article/?aid=582438 ) on a earlier visit in greece in 2007 she wore the tan jacket [ source ] ( http://www.triklopodia.gr/2014-07-20-113436/ ) p.s i found all that in two clicks , merkel does n't seem to own many different outfits, 
  so greece has 11 subs . 
  countries of similar size do n't even come close : portugal : 2 , belgium & nl : 4 . . heck we have more subs than italy ( 8 ) and germany ( 6 ) . 
  i know it 's the size and capabilities that are more important but still p.s also 4 zubr class hovercrafts for the lolz ( although i think only 1 is operational ), 
   sleep out in the hallway at the hospital because it 's too packed . 
  i thought only greece did that !, 
  shit , if sweden has n't solved the `` beds on the hallways '' problem , we 're hopeless, 
  was she also too tall for regular non-dutch baby beds ? 
   not to mention that he 's also the guy from home alone 2 : lost in new york . 
  what 's bad about that ? 
  it 's a very good family movie . . 
  oh yeah , quality of the steel deff matters .
