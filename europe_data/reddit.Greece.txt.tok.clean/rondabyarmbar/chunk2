  the recent m.o.u was voted with the support of nd , pasok , potami so tsipras could form a coalition gvt with them , that could last for 1-2 years . 
  although no polls have surfaced yet , i do n't believe the left platform will have a major impact , lafazanis etc do n't have the power to enter the parliament not to mention that they 'll be attacked and criticized by everyone . 
  as for nd , ca n't tell for sure , but their current leader ( albeit interim ) is very good , experienced and he could lead the party to the elections . 
  tsipras is very powerful and in a sense it 's a smart move to call elections while his popularity is still high , i think he could even score 151 seats in the parliament, 
  tsipras simply wants to put aside the radicals , aka the left platform and govern without them . 
  he could simply ask for the support of the opposition but he chose to hold elections instead, 
  thought you were done with syriza and greece ? 
  nope , now it 's the fun part, 
  the countries you listed have a very restricted jus soli , unlike the us , so an immigrant kid born in france will not automatically take french citizenship, 
  a small tldr : - greece received 158k migrants from january 1st to august 14 . 
  - 50k people arrived only in july , compared to the 43k that arrived in 2014 ( the entire year ) - '' total number of refugees and migrants crossing the mediterranean this year to some 264,500 , including 158,456 to greece , approximately 104,000 to italy , 1,953 to spain and 94 to malta '', 
  the diplomatic immunity does n't apply to traffic laws, 
  no way that 's true ( although plz be true ), 
  new democracy ( the conservative right wing party that won the previous elections . 
  if i recall correctly it was syriza , n.d then potami ( greek liberals , pro europe , although somewhat unclear policies ) , then golden dawn ( the nazis ) edit : according to that poll syriza had more votes than the january elections and their partner anel , did n't make it into the parliament, 
  syriza and tsipras are still ahead, 
  i think someone in the r.n is probably laughing now and saying : `` hahah i ca n't believe they fell for it ahhaahh '', 
  i presume pkk has a different meaning in greece than turkey , that 's probably why mention them along the kurds . 
  i 'll keep your proposal in mind though and thanks again for the answer, 
  thanks for the answer . 
  do you think the pkk attacks are actually pkk or could they be daesh and erdogan is blaming the kurds for political motives ? 
  ( tin foil hat on ! ), 
  is it me or have the terrorist attacks increased in turkey ? 
  are there more isis attacks/attempts or is it pkk ~ ~ and kurds ~ ~ ? 
  or both ? 
  any turkish redditors that can shed some light ? 
  edit : kurds part, 
  syriza will not exactly collapse , they radical leftists will probably leave and tsipras is still very popular, 
  just a small tl : dr of the current situation : the greek parliament approved the bailout program , although only 118 syriza mp 's * voted for it . 
  this means that tsipras has lost the majority in the parliament . 
  it is rumoured that he 'll call a censure motion next week to judge whether or not his party will support him . 
  the opposition will clearly vote against him . 
  nevertheless it 's almost certain that he 'll call for early elections in september or november . 
  * the greek parliament has 300 seats . 
  syriza has 149 seats and with the support of 13 anel mp 's they have the majority, 
  and i was only stating facts, 
  tldr of the australian system : stop migrant boats mid-seas give them food , water , supplies , point to indonesia and let them go . 
  if they do land , arrest them and imprison them to remote pacific islands outside of australia to die of diseases without the chance of getting assylum . 
  if they 're lucky they get raped and beaten up too . 
  did i say that even the un raised concerns about the conditions ? 
  yeah they do . 
  no i 'm not joking , sources [ 1 ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/22/could-australia-stop-the-boats-policy-solve-europe-migrant-crisis ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-11-11/un-committee-flags-concerns-about-australian-policy/5882190 ) [ 3 ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/08/opinion/australias-rigid-immigration-barrier.html ), 
  i did n't claim the translation was wrong , i do n't speak turkish ;-d i just wanted to clarify who did the talking, 
  is that the ones filming saying that or the migrants at the end ? 
  how fucking dense are you ? 
  constantinople was occupied by french , italian and british troops from the end of ww1 until 1923ish . 
  france also attacked southern turkey in parts of modern day syria and irak . 
  a part of eastern turkey was also attacked and taken by armenia . 
  and then there 's greece in asia minor . 
  you can call the battles that led to the creation of modern turkey , liberating , disastrous , or anything you wish, 
  from the foreign forces that were occupying their territory , i.e greece , italy , france , uk and armenia, 
   i honestly do n't know at all why syriza acted the way they did !, 
  simple . 
  they put the party above the country . 
  tsakalotos ( the current finmin ) , a few days before the referendum claimed that the reason for it , was that it would prevent the desintegration of syriza ( which will come eventually ) . 
  plenty of syriza deputees still mention the importance of keeping syriza intact . 
  yet noone mentions the destroyed economy and the numerous problems we are facing right now ( immigration could be another major issue ), 
  to anyone wondering , in the 2nd picture , if you zoom , you 'll see a `` no ttip '' on the hill, 
  the funny thing is that the irs ( the greek version ) does catch people and they do impose big penalties . 
  however since there 's no money the fines simply can not be payed . 
  there were several bn euros of unpaid fines until last year . 
  tax returns are currently frozen since there 's no money to pay them back . 
  so you 'll have to wait several months for a tax return . 
  they may not be deducted if the rules change again . 
  to eaborate on his bullshit , he could 've decided to reduce the salaries of the ministers and the deputees ( around 8k monthly ) or even reduce the numbers of the minister 's assistants ( i believe they are entitled to 18 ppl ) . 
  yet he did n't do anything but criticize the eu . 
  yes, 
  greek one is wrong, 
  all the prices have lowered , however the houses in islands still maintain their value . 
  appts in athens have lost up to 50 % of their price, 
  yeah it 's not as if syriza managed to create a new recession that would cost up to 10bn euros on the greek gdp or anything . . not to mention unemployement is increasing again and around 40bn euros left the greek banks . 
  sure , it 's definitely not syriza, 
  i thought your king 's summer home in greece already caused problems, 
   v tried to save your country , not sink it . 
  in politics , what matters are the results not the intentions . 
  with the exeption of a few loonatics in gr/eu politics , i think all of them were working towards a good solution . 
  in the end the solution was bad obviously, 
  well , you blame the eu , i blame the greek gvt ( more ) and the eu ( less ) . 
  as for your example with portugal i obviously agree . 
  i do n't believe that the -1 % decrease in greek unemployement in late 2014 and the primary surplus is an amazing achievement , it 's shit actually , but the current situation is even worse . 
  i also dislike varoufakis for his vanity and his passion for interviews . 
  i trully believe that his term was an attempt to gather material for a best seller and for that i despise him, 
  ok how about the -2 % to -4 % recession that 2015 will have ? 
  what about the 1 % primary deficit instead of the 1 % surplus that 2015 will have . 
  what about the 37bn euros that left the greek banks from november 2014 to this day ? 
  what about the 2,8 bn euros that the greek budget loses ** weekly ** due to the closed banks ? 
  what about the 60.000 businesses that plan to move to bulgaria ? 
  what about the fact that the greek economy returned to a recession and the next 2-3 years will probably be worse than before ? 
  what about the hospitals that are running out of medicine , including the only children 's cancer hospital , since it 's impossible to buy anything nowadays ? 
  what about unemployement increasing again ? 
  all these `` achievements '' were made by syriza , tsipras and varoufakis . 
  now please tell why i should keep supporting them . 
  oh and those are facts , not my opinion , they were posted by the parliament 's budget office a few days ago ( [ source ] ( http://www.pbo.gr/%ce%94%ce%b7%ce%bc%ce%bf%cf%83%ce%b9%ce%b5%cf%8d%cf%83%ce%b5%ce%b9%cf%82/tabid/199/artmid/4160/articleid/7822/%ce%a4%ce%a1%ce%99%ce%9c%ce%97%ce%9d%ce%99%ce%91%ce%99a-%ce%95%ce%9a%ce%98%ce%95%ce%a3%ce%97-%ce%91%ce%a0%ce%a1%ce%99%ce%9b%ce%99%ce%9f%ce%a3-%e2%80%93-%ce%99%ce%9f%ce%a5%ce%9d%ce%99%ce%9f%ce%a3-2015.aspx ), 
  clearly you have no idea about greek politics or any clue on economy . 
  you bought the v man circlejerk that he managed to sell so well . 
  funny thing , it 's syriza that always called for courts and treason charges on nd and pasok . 
   varoufakis might be a flawed idealist but he did at least try his best and acted according to his beliefs good for him . 
  now since his plans obviously failed , and the economy is destroyed will he face any charges ? 
  the capital controls and the closed banks have him to blame, 
  he couldnt fire savaidou .
