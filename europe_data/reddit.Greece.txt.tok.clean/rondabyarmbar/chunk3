  shes in charge of a semi independent agency . 
  the finmin cant do anything, 
  he has access , the troika does n't, 
  yeah my bad , i think it was an open debate or some kind though, 
  hmm apparently they told him to not reveal such plans in an open meeting with 70-80 people since nothing would remain private and his response was that he 'll deny everything . 
  i think his vanity will destroy him, 
  fyi the `` plan '' part starts around the 5th minute,

  the tweet is not even a denial , can you read ? 
  clearly you have n't heard what trolling is / s, 
  well since varoufakis denied it , he must be right . 
  it 's not like he has denied every fucking thing since his appointment . 
  including the rumor on capital controls which would never happen in a union, 
   or i seriously underestimated varoufakis ~ ~ naivety ~ ~ stupidity ... 
  the guy talked to the telegraph and confirmed this plan https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3eoii6/varoufakis_reveals_cloak_and_dagger_plan_b_for/ctgz7d8, 
   he had the authority to order both the ministry and the greek banks to do as he would like , no . 
  thankfully . 
  he 's the finance minister not god . 
  he needs approval from the pm , the parliament and even the eurogroup for some things  he would n't need to hack the tax registry numbers because the finance ministry already has every single one of them because they crate and manage the damn things . 
  that 's why we still ca n't combat tax evasion i guess . .  it 's just continuation of the scaremongering propaganda we 've been force-fed for quite some time now . 
  like the ones that talked about capital controls and closing the banks ? 
  there you go bae [ mr varoufakis told the telegraph that the quotes were accurate but some reports in the greek press had been twisted ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11764018/varoufakis-reveals-cloak-and-dagger-plan-b-for-greece-awaits-treason-charges.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter ), 
  you know he confirmed these claims right ? 
  pretty sure it would be unconstitutional and illegal under eu law too, 
  well his plan b was to hack the tax numbers of all greeks and distribute an alternative currency which no one would accept . . good effort , bad execution edit : slightly illegal too, 
  nordics ? 
  are romania , poland , france nordics ? 
  i though it was the greek flag ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_greece ), 
  he was probably bullshitting you tbh . 
  firstly there are no large radar units in evia , maybe he was in a small unit with limited capabilities . 
  evia is not really militarized . 
  secondly , all incidents with turkish ships are reported . 
  by all i mean all . 
  source : my military service , `` chasing '' a frigate . 
  thirdly :  maybe 100km off pireus , then left that 's pretty far actually . 
  do you mean 100m ? 
  tovima is pasok now ? 
  firstly turkey violates airspace even within the 6 mile line . 
  turkey is the only country that doens ' t accept the 6-10 difference . 
  hence the constant violations of the airspace . 
  no other country does it . 
  want a source ? 
  quote what i said troll, 
  sure let me check which countries have a casus belli on greece . . 
  surprise , only turkey, 
  your atrocities against litteraly every ethnicity in turkey , besides turks , prove your point, 
   and turkey rejects this claim . 
  something the rest of the world accepts, 
  the usual criticism on belgium was that it is a boring , cold and monotonous typical w.european country with little to offer . 
  belgium is obviously not like greece where there 's a nice beach or a historical monument in every corner but in belgium you kinda have to look for the nice places . 
  e.g brugges is an expensive tourist city but ghent is a lovely and cheaper alternative . 
  the tourist guides do n't say that . 
  as for brussels i completely agree . 
  the expensive rents are also a big negative . 
  what surprised me the most however ( in a negative sense ) was the criminality and the ghettoish feel even in expensive areas . 
  the prostitutes in avenue louise for example were totally shocking to me , and i 'm no stranger to prostitution, 
  kinda cool , decent park , meh good enough for me :-), 
  i did my master in brussels and i honestly had a great time . 
  despite what everyone said about brussels and belgium , i thoroughly enjoyed my time there, 
  noone has mentioned atomium in brussels ? 
  wtf is going on in that place ? 
  i was more puzzled than dissapointed really, 
  hopefully not enough to piss of the russians and not give us those sweet sweet rubles, 
   greece is addicted to debt . 
  providing greece additional loans is like giving drug addict more drugs / s, 
  hahaha i missed that thanks for pointing it out !, 
   the general attitude of greeks on this ** sub ** is probably a good indicator you should 've added a / s at the end, 
   to help some ** orthodox ** country too butthurt over our orthodoxy superiority friend ? 
  ha i got the reference, 
  what makes you think that i 'm not ? 
   wow , really ? 
  greece blackmailed the eu to include cyprus in that enlargement . 
  so much for greek `` solidarity '' . 
  sauce ? 
   so you want them to pay you for letting them into the eu ? 
  that 's exactly what i said . 
  our `` yes '' to their membership costs a few bn each . 
  it was in the treaties , read them  people were sympathetic to your cause until you started blackmailing the eurozone . 
  i did n't vote for syriza pal , i do n't agree with their strategy that created more problems . 
  now if you think that all greeks should suffer because of a stupid gvt , then good luck . 
   and then when they come asking for financial help to pay off the debt from living comfortably while we suffered ... and then you say fuck off . 
  which is what i would say if it was another country in the position of greece . 
  but why do you want other people to suffer too ? 
  i understand the emotional response in an individual level , however you ca n't allow politicians falling into such a rhetoric . 
  this is what breeds hate in a union where we 're supposedly equals . 
  wow !, 
  a russian military drill at kaliningrad ? 
  it 's as if nato does n't do the exact same thing in the baltics , in poland , in germany , in turkey , in romania , in bulgaria . . 
  yeah because russia is at the polish border preparing to attack, 
  that 's why i said solidarity when it suits us . 
  i did n't hear the baltics complain when nato and eu countries sent jets to monitor their airspace . 
  or i could even argue that poland and the baltics did benefit of the greek solidarity when we did n't veto their eu membership back in ' 04 , at a time when they were probably behind the european standards, 
  meanwhile she 's begging for nato and eu support to prevent a russian invasion . 
  solidarity when it suits us . 
  awesome union we have here, 
   to stop turkey and greece ? 
  and britain failed misserably . 
  not to mention that the british authorities were n't so . . friendly to locals . 
  stock market might not open tomorrow . . it 's not clear when they will, 
  it 's still 60 a day , but at the end of the week you can get 420 , if you did n't withdraw anything the previous days .
