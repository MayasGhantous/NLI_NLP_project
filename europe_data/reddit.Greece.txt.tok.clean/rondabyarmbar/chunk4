  to give more info . 
  capital controls will ** still ** be in place though, 
  is this a coup ?? 
  i 'm confused, 
  erm you had to change the name of the airport since the kavala airport in greece had the same name already . 
  it was n't an act of appeasement . 
  also , gligorov payed by greeks ? 
  lol man, 
  heck even greek unis allow inmates to enroll in a program . 
  maybe it 's something similar, 
  in that last picture of him it kinda looks like he does, 
  how bad is criminality in bulgaria that he needs to carry a pistol ? 
  are there any mob-type shootings ? 
  i had apple puree with chicken in belgium . 
  that would 've been unthinkable in greece, 
  investing in real estate in greece might be a bad idea . 
  the market was destroyed due to the crisis and i honestly do n't trust real estate anymore . 
  i do n't expect the prices to fall a lot more , but due to the current situation , i do n't expect it them to rise either . 
  nevertheless some expensive areas maintain their prices even in the crisis . 
  the prices in athens do n't fluncuate a lot either . 
  the expensive areas will be expensive , the cheap cheap . 
  there 's rarely a sudden increase in an area due to sudden popularity it might make sense to invest in an island like mykonos , but the prices there have n't reduced a lot . 
  this website has an english version and could give you an indication on prices http://www.homegreekhome.com/en/homepage good luck, 
  ok firstly thanks for the gold , given the fact that this is a trollish account i will use the power of gold for the benefit of redditors . 
  just give me a few hours to sleep because it 's 3am here and i 'm working tomorrow . 
  i 'll respond in a few hours, 
  the usual excuse is [ innocent passage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/innocent_passage ) although , imho innocent passage is not really respected . 
  turkish frigates have even reached andros in northern cyclades under this excuse . 
  it 's in the greek media all the time unfortunately, 
  meanwhile we have n't even recognized kossovo as an independent nation . . our ~ ~ finmin ~ ~ minister of foreign affairs is not a smart man, 
  do they mention anything about warship entering greek territory or nah ? 
  shhh . . have you been latvia lately?shhh, 
  the 100k apt would 've been double that , or more pre-crisis . 
  prices for smallish apts in central athens have reduced dramatically . 
  keep in mind that there are `` hidden '' costs when renting or buying . 
  a 400euro apt could end up costing ~ 100euros more , if you include heating bills , electricity , communal costs etc. 
  i 'm sure canada has similar `` hidden '' costs . 
  for places in greece , i obviously recommend athens , not only because it 's a great city but due to its infrastructure . 
  the biggest airport is in athens , the biggest port , the metro etc. 
  it would also make sense to use athens as a base and then travel around the country or in europe . 
  furthermore , athens has everything . 
  you could stay in southern athens and live next to the beach . 
  central athens to be close to center and shops/bars etc. 
  crete would also be a nice play to stay but with a small airport and bad infrastructure it would make your life harder . 
  thessaloniki is nice too and the city has a more laid back attitude ( too laid back imho ) . 
  smaller islands are pretty nice too , but they tend to be a bit `` dead '' during the winter . 
  not to mention some of them lack necessary amenities i.e doctors , hospitals etc. 
  visa-wise prepare yourself for a long procedure . 
  a few years ago , you could make a 250k investment in greece , ( even buying an apt ) and get a green card . 
  not sure if the rule is still there though . 
  greek here . 
  the costs are somewhat lower than northern/western europe but not as cheap as bulgaria or romania . 
  a 2 bedroom apt in central athens will be around 300-400 euros monthly , without electricity etc. 
  the prices to buy an apt of the same size will be 100k max . 
  if you really want a mediterannean feel , you could rent in some of the bigger islands , although prices may be higher . 
  however getting a job , in greece will be an issue , and i 'm not sure about visa requirements . 
  good luck, 
   accounting tricks ( again ) to present a surplus how are we surviving right now without a surplus ??? 
  magic ? 
  i agree with you . 
  it 's impossible to secure a good deal at this point and yes our options were a bad deal , a very bad deal and a catastrophic deal . 
  tsipras took the 1st option . 
  i support it . 
  concerning the ship owners it 's more complicated . 
  the actual ** ship ** owners do n't have their ships or capitals in greece but abroad and they are not taxed here . 
  what we have in greece , is mostly the service part of the industry . 
  these ones could change their base in a week and the country would lose income taxation of the workers . 
  i do n't agree with the policy but it 's all we can do for now . 
  the deal does have some good reforms in it , but some ares are not dealt . 
  taxing church property is not mentioned and that 's a lot of money . 
  i just hope that there will be some political stability and cooperation between the political parties for the next 2-3 years . 
  we can not handle more elections and more instability at the moment . 
  afterwards we could discuss about a debt relief , which is also very important . 
  haha my bad , it was n't directed towards you, 
  do you even economy ? 
  you 're wrong in every sentence, 
  that kinda changes the meaning of the term default does n't it ? 
  argentina defaulted a decade ago and they are still paying someof their debt . . 
  np , you can edit your post on top if you want to, 
  the problems we have now will be 10x times worse if we leave the eu . 
  simple as that . 
  the debt will increase with a national currency too ( the debt is in euros ) , and we will be unable to sell any gvt bonds . 
  we will have no funds even for simple payments . 
  the situation is bad , but it would be even worse outside the eu and outside the ez, 
  i blame the creditors too , do n't get me wrong . 
  nevertheless , some initial proposals they made , were far less extreme than those we have today . 
  tsipras could 've agreed on a bad deal in march but he thought ( did he ? ), 
  that he could completely reverse the situation . 
  it was clear to everyone that it was impossible , but the missed it . 
  i blame syriza members too , for pushing him ( and the country ) to the edge, 
  debt forgiveness will not magically happen with a national currency either . 
  the greek debt is in euros and if we return to a national and devalued currencly , the debt will increase . 
  also if the economy is not restructured , it will not handle a national currency either, 
  the majority of greeks are still pro euro . 
  translation : brutus who wanted kougi . 
  and now he 's enjoying the sun in his nice swimming pool . 
  g.v and his wife d.s in their home in aegina . 
  in his paradise he returned friday afternoon abandoning the parliament on a nationwide outcry . 
  p.s kougi was a city that was burned during the greek revolution , it was used by the defmin as a strategy towards the european partners, 
  short answer : yes .
