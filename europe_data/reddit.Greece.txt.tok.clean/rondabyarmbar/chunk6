  the ones in greece are stuck here , end of story, 
  i love how slovenians are so warry of migrants , yet no one has passed or stayed there . 
  do n't worry guys , we wo n't fuck you over , you can sleep peacefully, 
  davutoglu looks like that uncle that always has presents and games for you when you visit . 
  i ca n't hate the guy . 
  he even bought tsipras a koulouri ( simit ? ) !, 
  but yeah he 's horrible, 
  then the english will use archers !, 
  i 'm confused ? 
  sorry but the wiki page is a bit outdated ( not your fault ) . 
  out of the 4 zubr class for example only 2 are ( semi ) operational and the last 2 might be used for parts, 
  it weird to include ships that are rotting in port in salamina or are waiting for funds to be upgraded . 
  in any case your list is wrong . 
  you include the ship \u039c\u03a5\u039a\u039f\u039d\u0399\u039f\u03a3 \u03a122 which was destroyed in a fire years ago . 
  tthe navy is still considering whether or not to fix it.the sub \u039c\u0391\u03a4\u03a1\u03a9\u0396\u039f\u03a3 ( s122 ) is still being built . 
  \u0391faik many more are not even able to sail, 
  reserve in greek navy terms means rotting in a port until we have money to fix them, 
  i count at least 10 ships that are not in use / are permanently decomissioned . 
  amazing article / s, 
  uncorfimed reports close to the austrian pm , state that faymann is mad at tsipras for not inviting him at a recent bbq in athens , so he retaliated with the recent measures involving the migrants :-( (, 
  waiting on our deus ex machina . . ( plz come here soon , not funny anymore ), 
  we could donate lesvos and chios to you guys if you 're up for it . 
  the catch is that you have to take the refugees too tho, 
  personally i 'd prefer we stage another referendum so i can show my sick dance moves [ reference ] ( http://www.tsantiri.gr/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/xort3-656x410.jpg ) / s, 
  we are slowly becoming a failed state unfortunately . 
  we 're packed with refugees , our economy is ( again ) in shit , the government is either powerless or lacking motivation to work and our partners are against us . 
  it 's worse than what we faced last summer, 
  i do not trust the source 100 % either . 
  it 's a tabloid newspaper and the article sounds like an exagerated attempt to portray you as the bad guys . 
  the average european is n't living in a palace either, 
  i do n't like royalty for two of reasons actually . 
  firstly the negative experience that we had with our kings ( it can happen to anyone ) , secondly the fact that they gain a position strictly thanks to their birth , not thanks to their education or achievements - the whole thing seems very undemocratic and medieval . 
  hey the average greek is unemployed not working minimum wage !, 
  had . 
  two royal families , both horrible, 
  my impression after meeting dutch students was different , but i still do n't think the average dutch can afford a private plane flight to his summer home in greece, 
  we could agree to disagree . 
  i 'm obviously very anti-royal , due to our shitty royal family , so it 's not like i understand your admiration . 
  still your king 's summer home in greece looks pretty dope, 
   their lives are n't easy born in a palace . 
  free transportation with limos , private jets , helis . 
  no need to actually work . 
  even when they work is not actual `` work '' . 
  their lives must be hell / s  every time they do something slightly near the law and they have to publicly apologize unlike the rest of us who might get arrested  they need to behave and act proper in public even if they do n't want to like everyone in a public environment  to of our princes actually served in the special forces which is n't exactly easy . 
  good for them , but i doubt anyone would push them as the rest of the soldiers are . 
  who 's going to give you pushups when your daddy is the fuckin king ? 
  anyways i 'm biased obviously . 
  our kings were/are assholes and i could n't imagine a horse parade for the king 's birthday in greece with the crowd cheering for them . 
  fuck them i say . 
   they do n't live an easy life , oh come on !, 
  the average european , working minimum wage , living in a tiny appt with 3-4 housemates unsure about his/her future is living a tough life . 
  not the royal family member born in wealth , with a secure paycheck and future , with a summer home in some paradise . 
  i do n't have a problem with royals , but their life ** is ** easy, 
  communists agree to lower salaries , pensions , privatize public assets and cooperate with nato ? 
  also that you for proving to me that you have absolutely no arguments, 
  well you can take more people than greece , because you have a higher gdp , a functioning state , you are not in a recession for 6 years and your unemployement is not 27 % . 
  you also do n't have to deal with 800k people arriving in your islands . 
  other than that yeah , i totally do not get it either / s, 
   ** literally ** no financial burden the patrols by the coastguard ? 
  free the cost of processing them and giving them papers to travel ? 
  free the costs of feeding them and moving them to temporary camps ? 
  free the cost of having the international railway system blocked for days by migrants in northern greece ? 
  inexistant the cost of providing them medical care ? 
  free shit everything is free in greece, 
   what makes you think they will keep coming ? 
  news that they are stuck in greece will travel fast and they will likely stop coming , perhaps many will get on a boat and go back to turkey . 
  or cross the greek - bulgarian border which , unlike the greek - macedonian one will not be guarded . 
  or the greek - albanian border . . or take a boat from western greece to italy . . do you guys really think that migrants will simply say `` well the border is guarded , not much we can do , let 's go home now '' ? 
   my country has also taken more asylum applications per capita than greece . 
  what a surprise !, 
  i wonder why someone would pick finland instead of greece / s, 
  1 ) lauch not yet implemented . 
  2 ) 20k places , even though we 've received ~ 1 million of them . 
  yeah that 's very helpful, 
  i ca n't wait until they kick us out and we simply say : '' fuck off , we wo n't stop any migrants from crossing , it 's not like you gon na kick us out of the schengen twice '', 
  from your links : 1 ) 473 million : `` these funds will be allocated over time until 2020 '' ( my note : approved not yet allocated . ), 
  2 ) emergency money : `` the eu warned that the assistance will be limited to those who have been properly screened and fingerprinted '' with all the greece bashing / r/europe sees , i would expect better shitposting about my country . 
  mediocre, 
   you can put them in camps on greek islands unless we decide to build something huge , with the current capacities that greece has , that might be impossible . 
  lesvos for example received about 200k refugees , while the population of the island is around 80k !, 
  the island has a small and inequiped hospital , few policemen , bad infrastucture with regular problems with electricity , sewage and waste management . 
  can you imagine what will happen if the island 's population doubles without providing the necessary means to accomodate them ? 
  whoops, 
   `` there 's a big problem in greece , big problem , no money , '' says omar . 
  no shit omar , we know, 
  eventually the albanian border might also seal , although the terrain is mountainous and very difficult to patrol . 
  therefore migrants will still cross into albania, 
   if a country can not defend its borders , then it is directly on its military . 
  is anyone attacking greece atm ? 
  what is the military supposed to do , shoot the migrants ? 
  legally we can only help them to go to land , and process them . 
  we ca n't even put them in jail , so they can easily leave the country if they wish  shutting greece out of schengen seems a very reasonable approach . 
  very reasonable / s if that happens the migrants will magically stop arriving in greece / s, 
   2 ) do nothing and the country gets 1-2 million muslim migrants this year . 
  that is over 10 % of the population . 
  the country 's infrastructure & services will fail . 
  hello golden dawn ? 
  the migrants wo n't stay in greece . 
  they 'll flood the northern borders , find weak spots and go to northern europe.calais v2 in greece essentially . 
  if that does n't work , they 'll take a boat from western greece to italy and continue north again .
