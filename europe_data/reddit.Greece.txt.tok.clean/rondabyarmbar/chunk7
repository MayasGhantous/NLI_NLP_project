  the greek infrastructures btw are already failed . 
  unemployed greeks still have no free healthcare and are fucked in case they get really sick . 
  what i presume will happen is that we 'll be forced to adopt measures otherwise they 'll threaten with financial pressure , i.e no migrant camp , no next tranche . 
  mouzalas ( the minister ) is n't a member of syriza , he 's a doctor ( an obgyn ) with a private office who 's participated in several `` doctors of the world '' and `` msf '' programs around the world . 
  he was picked by the caretaker gvt due to his experience in dealing with refugees and simply kept his post after syriza was reelected . 
  i 'm laughing with the british journo asking the minister to repeat what he said . . 
  i 'm afraid the greek accent is n't very understood in bbc ;-d, 
  7th floor dude likes it minimal ;-d lady at 6th floor built a nice fort though, 
   temperatures are going to range from -20 to -30 celsius degrees for reference , during my military service in greece , whenever the temperature was close to 0 c , we would stay indoors and the guard duty time was reduced . 
  i have horrible memories of freezing my ass in -15 celcius , doing squats to warm myself , and hugging a stray dog for heat ( stupid dog left after a bit ) . 
  i would probably die in finland !, 
   any idea what they 're trying to accomplish with their actions towards greece ? 
  they constantly violate the greek airspace , mainly to show that they do n't recognize all of it as greek . 
  it 's a violent form of protest . 
  they also deny submitting flight plans when entering the athens fir . 
  oh and since 1995 , there 's a casus belli in case we increase the length of our territorial waters . 
  but yeah , nato allies, 
  reading `` illegal '' and `` newspaper '' in your post i thought you were going to suggest a very ghetto abortion method via newspaper . . 
  i 'm relieved, 
  true story ? 
  also very possible op, 
  is having a baby for 9 months not going to interfere with her menstrual cycle and become uncomfortable ? 
   here 's a thought , how can greeks have so much pride if they ca n't even maintain a functioning country without loads of outside support ? 
  hey , we were proud even before the crisis and the borrowing you know . . 
  would n't it be cheaper and easier for greece to just let all the migrants pass and go to germany ? 
  the proposed eu - coast guard will not be created to guard greece but to guard the rest of europe . 
  you missed the comma, 
  probably my mistake . 
  i changed it, 
  mcribs are not sold in greece ;-( (, 
   is this a last attempt to earn at least something ? 
  probably . 
  i do n't think an improverished prostitute will make any significant amounts of money . 
  a high class escort , sure , but the random woman will not, 
  tldr : the journalist misquoted a survey and such incidents do not occur in greece . 
  translation by me and google prof. . grigoris lazos denies the report in the times of london titled `` greek students have sex for food '' , which carries his statement saying that greek female students are turning to prostution in order to feed themselves . 
  the report , which according to the professor , is apparently based on a misunderstanding of the author , offers easy `` food '' to the readers of the newspaper based on stereotypes and exaggerations spread abroad on the effects of the crisis in our country . 
  mr. lazos says in `` to vima '' he never said something like that in the newspaper as the long research in the field of prostitution in greece has come to no such conclusion . 
  `` i do not deny that this would have happened , but i think we are talking about insignificant sizes . 
  however i have not recorded it `` says mr. lazos . 
  according to a report in the british newspaper , greek women today , are dominating the domestic prostitution industry , displacing those of eastern europe . 
  sex offered in greece is one of the cheapest in europe . 
  there is clearly an increase in the rates of prostitution in our country , says mr. lazos in `` to vima '' and the figure is around 12 to 12.5 % overall and clearly linked to the crisis . 
  `` this figure is not insignificant when one realizes that this increase is not followed by any reduction of their respective populations , '' says mr. lazos . 
  he also states the existence of a number of almost 300 men in the prostitution ring in greece and can not calculate the percentage of child prostitution . 
  `` there are children but fortunately in such cases the police have an aggressive attitude , '' he says . 
  lazos generally adds that the special feature of recent years is the extreme impoverishment of women involved in prostitution . 
  `` the state has unfortunately decided to ignore the phenomenon , there 's no welfare . 
  in greece when you talk about prostitution , you deliver everything to the free market `` emphasizes characteristically . 
  p.s i actually took some courses under this prof while studying in greece . 
  he 's the only specialist in the field of prostitution in the country and i never imagined that he could have published something so wrong . 
  i was right . 
  furthermore , he 's a great guy with plenty of stories to tell edit : some translation errors, 
  the author forgot to specify that the owner of the sandwich has to be greek . 
  that 's why you run out of luck !, 
  but seriously the articles is bullshit, 
   that the turkish pilot sounds quite stressed towards the end that 's probably a radar operator and not the pilot tbh, 
   when was the last time you shot down their plane or they shot down yours ? 
  although in 2006 a turkish and a greek plane collided and the greek pilot died,

  even the wikipedia page has it wrong pff, 
  personally i would add `` l'etranger '' ( the stranger ) rather than `` la chute '' but i guess it 's a personnal preference . 
  also , random fact , most of the books you mentioned were necessary for my french classes and / or sorbonne exams ( the language tests , not the uni ) . 
  from my experience montenegrin cuisine was pretty good . 
  they also have a local prosciutto which tastes fantastic and is a lot cheaper than the italian ones . 
  fish was fantastic and super cheap when i was there, 
  thanks . 
  although that legislation was designed by the troika and very little was designed by greek politicians . 
  just a fyi, 
  huh , true . 
  maybe they need a break from the sun, 
  that should n't have happened , but it does n't prove anything , other than a bored guard . 
  they should have checked his passport, 
  i mean , no offence to genevans . . 
  but it 's a holiday in geneva , not ibiza . . 
  tbf that 's a typical terrorist attack , fairly frequent in athens , around high value targets ( embassies , banks etc ) . 
  i do n't think it 's particularly directed against france or french people . 
  hey do n't you think we forgot about you guys !, 
  mama merkel is the main pillar of europe atm . 
  do n't you dare vote for someone else !, 
  plus , with all the new wall building technologies ( thanks to the mexican wall ) , you might find better solutions to the water problems . 
  so win win for nl, 
  good idea !, 
  you could even sail to croatia and finish stannis 's job ;-d, 
  you could do a nice summer tour of finland and the baltics . 
  roumania , bulgaria could be easily visited even with interail . 
  but why corfu ? 
  al - baghdadi did nothing wrong - 4chan 2055, 
  constantinople march intesifies ... 
  il duce is a douche, 
  for similar reasons we do n't celebrate the ww1 armistice , which is also a weird thing, 
  he was n't in politics back then, 
   at least the uk has the self respect to accept the financial consequences of leaving the eu , greece should look there for example . 
  350 mil drachmas for greek hospitals if we leave the eu !, 
  top kek bro, 
   michael flea lol . . 
  but google translate was correct . 
  his name is michael psylos , psylos means flea, 
  great thanks,
