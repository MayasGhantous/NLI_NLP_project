  honest question . 
  what if someone claims to be younger than 14 , apart from scans ( that are not used in every country ) is any way to verify the claim without legal documents ? 
  then go to another country !, 
   r/europe will be happy to tell you about the ecnomy of scale and how this does n't matter . 
  hahahahahahahahahahahahaha no . 
  i competely agree . 
  i was commenting on this :  the very act of separating off gays from marriage and calling their unions something else makes them unequal . 
  civil unions are not exclusive to gay couples , they do n't call their union something else , they do n't allow marriage . 
  now i agree , this is wrong , just wanted to clarify this little detail . 
  there were even news about offering them [ free legal help ] ( http://www.naftemporiki.gr/story/1132745/mnimonio-gia-dorean-nomiki-boitheia-se-prosfuges-kai-metanastes ) funded by the ccbe ( the article is in greek , but you get the idea ) , not to mention free healthcare . 
  at least a `` thank you '' would be better than saying `` your country is poor , i want more '' . 
  thanks , it is a pain on mobile . 
  we are talking about mostly non-syrians anyway . 
  more than half of them are n't refugees . 
  see , here in greece we have many genuine refugees ( along with many assholes ) . 
  when those people travel to germany or france they need to start being treated like economic migrants . 
  the burkini ban is stupid . 
  of course i would prefer if there were no burkas or hijabs , but forcing people to get rid of them is against democracy and freedom of expression . 
  deporting criminals has nothing to do with freedom of expression and is the only reasonable thing to do . 
  seriously , albanians are really secular and many even changed their religion in the blink of an eye in order to marry . 
   it is like nazism merely killed 20 million people 100 years ago , but meh , let nazism still be a valid movement in europe no , it is like saying that because the nazist killed 20 million people , the current generation of germans is still to blame, 
  i agree , but you got it slightly wrong.civil unions are there for both gay and hetero couples , it is not something `` specifically made for gays '' . 
  i do n't get this , it is not like the kids have anywhere better to go and gay couples are unable to provide as much as hetero couples can . 
  i have to say this , you guys make such excellent food i am glad we `` borrowed '' quite a few recipes . 
   i did not want to be a nazi , they are bad , i learned all my life . 
  and they still are , this scared me . 
  i felt like a insanely cruel person . 
  the problem in a nutshell . 
  of course nazis are bad , but criticizing immigration policies do n't make you one, 
  this is a stupid ban , but it is all that people have to show their disdain so it is only reasonable to support this . 
   sucks for you . 
  i was commenting on that part . 
  do you want tsipras too ? 
  we will make you a special offer 2 for 1 , claim your prize now to get the wombo combo of feta + the original greek yoghurt . 
  what the fuck is this supposed to mean ? 
  is this a way to tell me i can whine all i want because seriously , you are the only one whining here . 
   this `` burkini ban '' is fucking ridiculous . 
  yes  you know what we should be banning ? 
  fat hairy men in fucking banana hammocks . 
  everyone has to follow the same set of rules , that is what is wrong . 
  uniforms exist for the reason , hell even the name implies a set of homogeneity , if they refuse to wear it for whatever reason then this is obviously their problem ( and by `` their '' i mean absolutely anyone who wants to be treated differently for a stupid reason ) . 
  that is like saying you can have mohawk if you are a lawyer or you can operate a patient wearing pyjamas . 
  we live in a society based on simple rules everyone has to follow . 
  no exception made . 
  would you see anywhere in mena country that cross is `` made part of the uniform '' ? 
  why should people enforce their beliefs on us . 
  i am in favour in believing to whatever floats your boat , but this is n't simply `` freedom of religion '' . 
  tolerance of the intolerance should not be named tolerance . 
  can i ask where did you get that from ? 
  i do n't doubt it , but i must have missed this as the article left me believing the contrary . 
  that is terrible :( stay safe . 
  i do n't doubt this , i am arguing that there are obviously `` frenchmen '' who do not feel french at heart . 
  so , germans should learn the language of people living in their country instead of the citizens of germany learning german ? 
  did you forget the / s tag or are you being serious ? 
  [ wow , this is actually a thing ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/russian-man-marries-pizza-because-6846784 ), 
  indeed . 
  i am sharing the recipe in case anyone is interested . 
  ## ingredients for the soutzoukakia : * 1 kg mixed ground meat * 3-4 cloves of garlic * 1 tsp cumin powder * a bit of olive oil * pepper * tomato sauce * 1\u00a01/2 cup breadcrumbs or half a loaf of stale bread soaked in water or red wine * sugar * cinammon ( optional ) ## how to : * mix all the ingredients and shape into oblong soutzoukakia ( just like the first picture ) . 
  * heat the oil in the frying pan and fry for 3-4 minutes just enough to change their colour to light brown . 
  * add the tomato sauce , a little cumin powder , salt , pepper , a little sugar in the tomato sauce and a little water . 
  * let them cook over medium heat for half an hour . 
  enjoy with rice or mashed potatoes . 
  not wanting gays to parade = killing gays for being gay i am not saying either is correct , but obviously one of the two is the better option, 
  hmm ... closer to [ this ] ( http://www.gastrotourismos.gr/cache/files/9329fd720a217c3521a459e3c13f4008dcc5c050.jpg ) ? 
  do you mean [ soutzoukakia ] ( https://s4.postimg.io/lzvy6l06l/soutzoukakia3.jpg ) ? 
  since hearing many stories first-hand people glorifying the ussr make me sick . 
  you would be surprised . 
  most greeks have a really low tolerance to cold . 
   abnormal : deviating from what is normal or usual it fits the definition , the question remains , why should we care as long as it does n't affect anyone else ? 
  exactly , why should we even have an oppinion on this ? 
  just fuck off and marry whoever or whatever floats your boat.marry a pizza if you want i do n't care . 
  problem is , we are europe :(, 
  you are right , i totally disagree with the content of this post , but it is in no way downvote-worthy ( like `` he is right though ... '' ) . 
  i wish more subs allowed for healthy debate instead of being an endless circlejerk . 
  yes , but most of the athletes there are the best of the best and it usually comes down to slight diffetences , so having more athletes would give you a better change of winning . 
  that ' t true , but one the other hand we could n't send that many eu athletes . 
  well , keep in mind the metals are bronze + silver + gold combined , so if three eu citizens were to finish in the first three places that would only amount for one metal . 
  greece is one of the most [ diverse ] ( http://img.youtube.com/vi/v_aefn27_a8/maxresdefault.jpg ) countries . 
  that will probably deter everyone, 
  i agree . 
  it is easy for every reasonable being that you can fuck whoever you want , but abortion is tricky . 
  that seems like the ideal solution . 
  people would n't worry about integration and the genuine refugees could really be safe until the situation in their home stabilizes . 
   you seem to give a lot of flying fucks , that was your whole issue . 
  i do , just not for being called a racist  there are always women afraid to go out . 
  but you shut them off , marginalized them and discarded their experiences completely by labelling them `` hysterical feminazis '' who `` hate men and the patriarchy '' . 
  most of my `` alleged feminazi friends '' do call men misogynistic and they do say the word patriarchy at least five times a day . 
  are there many men perpators ? 
  undoubtedly . 
  however refugees do commit [ disproportionately more crimes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na9yjrqtwg0 ) ( sources in the description ) . 
  all i am saying is that instead of realizing that [ there is a problem ] ( http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/01/its-not-only-germany-that-covers-up-mass-sex-attacks-by-migrant-men-swedens-record-is-shameful/ ) we call each other `` nazi '' , `` commie '' or `` racist '' . 
   pretend to care about womens safety ? 
  i must be an idiot considering i am a woman ... 
  yep , the news is the ethnicity of the offenders . 
   there is plenty of food -- but what there is ? 
  it is not good . 
  i need cigarettes  `` in afghanistan , we have this thing called bolani [ a stuffed flat bread ] and we eat it with tomatoes and potatoes ... and the fruit juices ... it was all so yummy '' , she said longingly . 
  `` but here we have to eat the food they give us , '' she added , looking thoroughly glum at the prospect . 
  ( to highlight the fact that she is not syrian )  `` maybe the food will be different for iftar . 
  it has to be different .
