yatsenuk and svoboda 's proposal for a new banknote of 1000 hryvna with bandera on it . 
  is that true , though ? 
  yes . 
  is n't it strange it 's the eu commissioners making these statements when supposedly we are the ones begging the eu for money ? 
  tarbatu je estonia !, 
  yeah , i am a shill , you got me . 
  ever wonder why you are the only ukrainian getting heavily downvoted in this sub ? 
  a random redditor accuses chomsky of being brainwashed . 
  hahahahahahahahahahahhahahahhahahahahaha . 
  if anything , chomsky would be the brainwasher . 
  the only words in russian i know is `` gaspaza '' , `` da '' , and `` narodnaya '' . 
  thanks for the compliment though . 
  i love how your argument is a ** hypothetical ** us invasion of [ nicaragua ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/contras ) or [ venezuela ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_venezuelan_coup_d%27%c3%a9tat_attempt ) . 
  reddit is really funny sometimes . 
  we 're all mongol brothers here . 
   what if us it 's not `` what if '' buddy . 
  it has happened , countries have been ruined so that the us wo n't lose an inch of geopolitical or economic influence . 
  bay of pigs , cuban missile crisis , greek civil war ( first use of napalm b incendiary bomb ) , pinochet coup in chile and numerous others . 
  the budapest and prague interventions by the soviets were the other side of the same coin . 
  they 're not the unimaginable tragedy you people think they are . 
  i mean the prague invasion had like , what , 70 dead ? 
  in the same year the mexican police killed 300 students just because they protested the olympics . 
  pinochet killed and disappeared thousands of people in a few months . 
  feel free to get your dose of western democracy , but allow us to be more skeptical . 
  the comments in this thread are pure ad hominem and butthurt . 
  chomsky is well-spoken and his arguments in this video are far from conspiracy theory , whether you agree with them or not . 
  well , you 're the most pro-american country in the world and it 's the economist , i 'd expect you to be at least a couple points higher than norway . . 
  so ... [ thatcher uk  ( http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20130413_cuk400.jpg?1365694334 ) +100 democracy points . 
  [ putin 's russia  ( http://33.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m07vfr4zc31qd65vgo1_400.jpg ) -50 democracy points . 
  [ assad 's syria  ( http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/521f50bcecad04bb0dff5314-960/bs1znjhimaaxdhu.jpeg ) -200 democracy points . 
  wow , do you believe every bullshit subjective ranking you see posted on the internet ? 
  golden dawn are split between the nazi worshipping they practice when among themselves and the nationalist face they present to the public . 
  for the inner circle of the party there is no comparison , hitler is above everything , even the greek revolution . 
  there are some quite comical photographs of private meetings of gd members wearing all kinds of nazi uniforms and insignia , for example . 
  ` normal ' greek nationalists have indeed been pro-russian , there was even a supposed prophecy during the ottoman rule that `` greece would be saved by the blonde nation '' , meaning the russians . 
  all that changed during the soviet period when the same nationalists feared that `` greece would be drowned in a slavic sea '' . 
  that 's a great story , thanks for sharing . 
  the greek partisans , although not as influential as the yugoslavs , were one of the greatest resistance movements in europe . 
  apart from the armenians you mentioned , they included jews who fled the cities to survive , italians who defected after italy 's surrender , even germans belonging to the [ * bew\u00e4hrungstruppe 999 * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strafbattalion#bew.c3.a4hrungstruppe_999 ) ( wehrmacht penal unit ) . 
  you should check [ her ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lyudmila_pavlichenko ) , also ukrainian , female and badass . 
  obviously , it 's the daily mail . 
  although it would n't be surprising if most of the participants looked ugly , poverty and ugliness go together , for a lot of reasons .

  yeah . 
  or i do n't know , germany in 1940 ? 
  conquering 4-5 countries in a year must qualify as more aggressive than the half-assed proxy war russia is engaged at the moment . 
   when you keep the meat in for a long time , it will expire and the quality is not always the best . 
  i love these weird eastern european proverbs . 
  golden dawn are not openly pro-kremlin , they are nazi opportunists . 
  they 'll say anything to hide their true nature and fool unsuspected people . 
  they have made some pro-russian comments but they were pro-maidan too , especially identifying with the right sector/svoboda crowd . 
  as evidenced by some ukrainian nationalist blogs ( `` ukrainian crusade '' , etc ) , the admiration goes both ways . 
  my grandad fought in the albanian front of the [ greco-italian war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greco-italian_war ) . 
  i always asked him if he killed any italians and he always avoided answering me . 
  he achieved the rank of sergeant or sergeant major , \u0399 ca n't recall exactly . 
  i remember a story : while advancing into an albanian village , they found a house where some retreating italian troops had hidden . 
  the greeks asked them to come out and the italians refused . 
  they only reluctantly decided to do so when my grandad threatened to throw a grenade through the chimney of the house . 
  he always claimed that italian pows were generally good , peaceful folk who did n't want any part in mussolini 's plan to restore the roman empire . 
  also , two of my great-grandfathers fought in the [ greco-turkish war of 1919-1922 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greco-turkish_war_%281919%e2%80%9322%29 ) . 
  srebrenica was between bosnians and bosnians but you 'd get arrested in germany if you were a member of mladic 's army . 
  just saying , i am not comparing the two incidents . 
  there are pictures of him casually strolling among the maidan/right sector crowd while the building is on fire and people are burning and/or getting shot inside . 
  the russians claim he posed with corpses too but i have n't seen these . 
  every fucking time russia is discussed some american or canadian will jump in to remind us how irrelevant russia is . 
  maybe it 's not that irrelevant seeing you people always feel the need to talk about it . 
  damn , do n't make me sound like the stupid nationalist greek shit i have been hating all my life :p ok sure , macedonian it is . 
  there are no `` friends '' in international politics . 
  even within the eu , as the eurozone crisis has proven . 
  also , everyone is underestimating russia 's capabilities . 
  i advise you to take a look at the map . 
  edit : as for assad , you make it sound like it 's a terrible thing . 
  the us have [ these guys ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/03/politics/9-11-attacks-saudi-arabia-involvement/ ) as their middle eastern allies . 
  i 'll take assad all day long . 
  hate to be that guy , but calling the language macedonian is kind of meh because macedonian already existed and it was a greek dialect . 
  slavic-macedonian is more appropriate linguistically . 
  imo we should propose and they should accept north macedonia and be done with this shit . 
  so they are finland 's mongol bros :o come on , you even have a city called turku !, 
  sure , whatever makes you feel better i guess . 
  [ the obvious ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ancient_greek_religion ) . 
  we even convinced the romans and gauls [ to use our system for a while ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/interpretatio_graeca ) . 
  it was nice before those pesky germans came along ^ ^ / jk, 
  so , when did the portuguese become so conservative ? 
  the social-democrat and conservative parties polling at 35-40 % , i mean wtf portugal ? 
  are n't they the ones that brought you into this mess in the first place ? 
  wtf are you even talking about ? 
  portugal entered in 1986 , cyprus in 2004 . 
  woah , buddy . 
  a portuguese making `` lazy greeks '' jokes ? 
  you know you do n't have the best reputation yourselves , right ? 
  yep . 
  `` olof palme '' after the swedish prime minister who got murdered , `` kara\u0111or\u0111e of serbia '' , `` square of argentine democracy '' with a statue of san mart\u00edn , mutiple streets and squares after jfk , a statue of truman next to the us embassy , `` el alamein '' and `` rimini '' streets and obviously multiple streets and even a whole suburb are named after lord byron . 
  was n't tito croatian ? 
  or is this a joke ? 
  just googled them and they belong in the liberal europarliament group . 
  i doubt they can be much pro-russian when they are in one of the mainstream europarliament parties . 
  are they liberal in the economic sense ? 
  wikipedia says `` centre left/populist '' . 
  yep . 
  the ancient greek word is '' \u03b8\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1 '' ( thyra ) , which actually has the same etymological root as `` door '' .
