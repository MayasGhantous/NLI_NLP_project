  you just have to ask , 
  he 's being downvoted because people are too proud to admit they in fact bailed out the too-big-to-fail german and french banks disguised as greedy greek pensioners and cleaning ladies . 
  [ `` americans for limited government '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/americans_for_limited_government ), 
  i just checked the wikipedia page for the uk-eu referendum and the last 2 polls have completely different results , in the first ( ipsosmori ) it looks like yes is winning by a landslide , in the second ( yougov ) it 's a lot closer . 
  your thoughts on this ? 
  also , how would you say the whole greek drama is affecting the eu referendum discussion in britain ? 
  romania , ukraine and the rest have * completely * destroyed corruption , have n't you heard ? 
  they 've even volunteered to lend us their tax police !, 
  we can only be compared to sub-saharan africa now , mate . 
  it 's time people stopped thinking of nations as if they were households , with one unified will and thought process , that voted in the same way , were uniformly corrupt and tax evading , etc. 
  the vote breakdown from yesterday was the most polarised of all time in regard to class structure . 
  in the most wealthy suburb of the country ( ekali ) people voted 85 % in favour of yes while in the most poverty stricken area of athens ( piraeus b ) 72,5 in favour of no . 
  i pity the journos working overtime tonight digging up all his ancient interviews , articles and videos in case they need to portray him as an `` extremist communist '' in the future . 
   tsakalotos has been against greece being a member of the eurozone since before it existed . 
  in 1998 he wrote a paper on the destructive effects the eurozone in it 's current/then design would have on greece . 
  seems like a sensible man to me . 
  do you have a link to that article ? 
  i am sure he was considered a lunatic by the greek academic establishment then for not wanting greece to ` join in the party ' - much like everyone who was against the olympics was a miserable traitor . 
   i do not think this is one that 's going to budge to creditor demands ( lengthening the suffering he predicted would happen 17 years ago ) being against the euro * then * is n't the same with wanting to leave * now * . 
  ok , he is a clown , a joker , a psychopath , a narcissist . 
  he 's gone . 
  how is schulz behaving in the partisan way he did ok by eu standards ? 
  i am 26 so according to / r/europe 's version of greek reality i am prime for retirement and life in some villa in mykonos . 
  where do i sign up ? 
   btw i was n't joking about romanians and reading , if only more greeks had the same habit . 
  i do n't see a juncker resignation . . 
   one nation 's democracy blackmailing 26 nations ' democracies . 
  let 's keep this quote for the next time poland or latvia bitch and moan when the eu asks them to take in 200 immigrants . 
  why are you speaking like british gentry ? 
  it 's a function of how much power you have as a country , all the morality bullshit and `` standing by the rules '' is pure hypocrisy . 
  let 's see how tough the germans and the dutch are going to be when cameron comes demanding exceptions to the ten commandments of the eu treaties . 
  i never thought i would find myself rooting for conservative british politicians . . 
  if you think the rise of fascism in any european country , even smaller ones like greece or hungary , is irrelevant for the future of the eu project you are deluded . 
   now it only receives 700euros extra i knew romanians like reading , did n't know you were into science fiction though . 
  his [ ( distant ) uncle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thrasyvoulos_tsakalotos ) was quite famous . . 
  talk about beating a dead horse . 
  amazing how / r/europe still believes tsipras is asking putin for money . 
  katyusha is a common tune for political , football and other chants in greece . 
  has been for 70 years now . 
  if we sing to the tune of tipperary does it mean we are pro-british imperialism ? 
  politicians make * plans * ? 
  conspiracy !, 
  the yes side . 
  were private tv stations playing 24/7 telling people to vote against russia in crimea ? 
  when was the last time the head of european parliament , which is supposed to represent all the european mps and not act like a german minister , called an elected politician of another country a `` clown '' ? 
  so the next time an eastern european demands better living conditions we can bring the africans to lecture them , amirite ? 
  you can always count on the eastern european mujahideens of austerity to provide the stupid comments . 
   just said no to cut on spending that 's simplistic and ultimately wrong . 
  we have cut hard . 
  it has n't worked . 
  is there a word other than * populism * for these half-truths that are repeated ad nauseam ? 
  he thought you were icelandic . 
  lmao this conversation is golden , i am upvoting everything . 
  you are like a modern day hyperborea for us greeks . 
  we do n't know exactly where you are on the map or what you * really * do , but we have heard you 're great guys . 
  ^ ^ except ^ ^ when ^ ^ we ^ ^ mistake ^ ^ you ^ ^ for ^ ^ ireland, 
  we produced banks too . 
  and exported them to the balkans . 
  yeah , let 's appoint some technocrats already !, 
   yanis called the european programme in greece `` the biggest cock up in economic history '' . 
  and ? 
  can they argue that it was correct or all they got to say is `` boo-hoo !, 
  yanis is lecturing us again ! '' ?? 
  are european politicians really that sensitive ? 
  average wage ? 
  where can i find this average wage of 1004 euros ? 
  highly doubt anything like this happened . 
  i was in syntagma square both on friday and yesterday and there were hundreds of foreign journalists and tv crews hanging around and no one gave a damn . 
  and they certainly were n't afraid of the crowd , we were asked like 10 times to speak to journos . 
  no , only the first one , [ otto ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/otto_of_greece ) . 
  the rest were `` of greece and denmark '' . 
  if the baltics want into nordic maybe we can give them our deposed gl\u00fccksburg monarchs . 
  if you make schulz shut up we 'll do the same with varoufakis , 
  i only quoted varoufakis to show how he meant the word ` terrorism ' . 
  i explicitly said that \u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1 translates to terrorism . 
  i also said terrorism has a more narrow meaning . 
  should we also accuse the washington post for writing the eu wants to destroy greece or the guardian for writing this is financial carpet-bombing ? 
  that 's the live feed of choice for me , i agree they are better than the others . 
  it 's disappointing because they are trying to find a balance between supporting anti-austerity greeks but not pressing too hard on the eu because most left-wingers in the uk are pro-eu . 
  also , their primary correspondent in greece , helena smith , is outright right-wing and biased in her reporting . 
  she claimed tuesday 's pro-yes rally is the largest she has seen in greece ffs . 
  the devil is in the details . 
  the rather more liberal meaning makes a ton of difference . 
  come on , have you never heard of mega channel accused of ` terrorism ' ? 
  no one blinks an eye . 
  thank you . 
  if only more of your compatriots and other northern europeans understood that most greeks did n't want the bailout in 2010 and the debt restructure in 2011-12 . 
  \u03a4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1 translates to terrorism but it does n't have the same meaning . 
  here it basically means ` campaign of fear ' . 
  the guardian has been quite disappointing with checking their sources and accurately portraying things that happen in greece for the last few days . 
  ** edit ** : wow that 's a lot of responses . 
  as others have pointed out , ** fearmongering ** or ** scaremongering ** is an even more accurate description of the word 's meaning . 
  would someone in the us accuse fox news of terrorism/terrorising/terror ? 
  here it is extremely common and not just by left-wing commentators . 
  ** edit 2 ** : the ** relevant ** part from the interview ( emphasis mine ) :  `` what brussels and the troika want today is for the yes [ vote ] to win so they could humiliate the greeks . 
  why did they force us to close the banks ? 
  to instil fear in people . 
  and *** spreading fear is called terrorism *** . '', 
  it 's disgustingly pro-yes . 
  a major news station ( antenna ) called a relatively affluent suburb of athens ( chalandri ) `` the new north korea '' , just because its mayor said he supported no .
