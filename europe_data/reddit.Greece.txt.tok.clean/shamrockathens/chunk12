  the students vote 83 % for no and 13 % for yes . 
  a facebook group for my school with over 1000 members held a poll and the results were very similar . 
  it 's clear that the young people are overwhelmingly for no . 
  also , in both public * and * private employees the no vote is ahead . 
  the only social groups where yes is ahead are pensioners , housewives and businessmen ( though it makes no distinction between employers and self-employed ) . 
  the girl with the blue hair though . . 
  \u0399 think this ship has sailed . 
  imf 's decision to release its debt analysis today , former ec president romano prodi 's and renzi 's quotes , also today , show that the eurozone kicking out greece is very unlikely . 
  also , the insane media propaganda in favour of ` yes ' in the greek media ( trust me , you ca n't comprehend how bad it is unless you 're greek ) and insulting statements such as the one by martin schulz today have done a lot of harm to the ` yes ' camp . 
  schulz is going to get a lot of bitch-slapping by juncker . . 
  hehehehehehehehehehe thanks obama !, 
  they wo n't allow you to hold a referendum though . 
  try it . 
  please , 
  nice straw man there , but i wo n't bite . 
  the nsa wikileaks , the imf leaks and many other documents , books , etc released since 2010 clearly show that merkel , schauble and co constantly contradict themselves , lie to the greeks and lie to the german voters about the viability of the greek bailouts . 
  if you ca n't accept it that 's your problem . 
  the opposite is also true . 
  most here are right-wing when it comes to economic matters . 
   if they sign everything we will be again here in a few months , maybe a year . 
  i am starting to believe those who say this is deliberate on merkel 's behalf . 
  they really do n't want a long term solution , they want the ez to be in crisis_guardian_live_feed_omg_it 's _ happening mode every few months . 
  the constant fear of a grexit keeps the euro low which helps german exports . 
  yeah ... not believing him . 
  i was n't blaming the americans , i was just anticipating the knee-jerk reaction . 
  it 's the economics version of `` if you like immigrants so much maybe you should take them in your house '' . 
  inb4 `` if the americans love greece so much maybe they should pay for their debt ! '', 
  which guys ? 
  the `` yes '' side in greece loooove rajoy 's ~ ~ anti-greek ~ ~ anti-syriza propaganda . 
  do n't people in spain understand that * if * podemos were to take power in spain , alone or in a coalition , they 'd be in a much better position to negotiate than greece ? 
  i mean you 're spain , you do n't need greece to find examples or counter-examples . 
   greece 's negotiators were encouraged or maybe mocked by the troika to hold a referendum in may if they thought they could not accept the deal . 
  they did not call one . 
  i am going to need a source on this one or else i call bs . 
  edit : no worries , just found it ( [ http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/11/eurozone-greece-schaeuble-idusb5n0vd02620150511] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/11/eurozone-greece-schaeuble-idusb5n0vd02620150511 ) ), 
  what about papandreou 's proposed referendum in 2011 ? 
  in an eerily similar way with what is happening today the reactions were : - you crazy bro ? 
  - this is a bad decision because reasons . 
  - i am going to tell you when to hold the referendum ( sarkozy ) - i am going to tell you what the question of the referendum is going to be ( merkel ) - please cancel it i also found this gem ( emphasis mine ) :  dutch prime minister mark rutte said the cancellation was a good decision amidst possible ** eurozone impatience with greece ** . 
  `` it was ** a bizarre proposal ** . 
  we think it 's of great importance to the eurozone that we prevent greece from going bankrupt . 
  but in the end , ** the euro is more important than greece 's membership of the eurozone ** . '', 
  but yeah , let 's just pretend it 's the arrogance of varoufakis and tsipras that 's to blame for europe 's stance . 
  ( this is n't a jab at you just because you 're german , i respect your opinion even though i do n't agree most of the time and i 'd like to hear what you think ), 
  and how do you think the debts of other countries are produced ? 
  by peace and prosperity ? 
  our debt basically dates back to the war of independence and all the major defaults happened after catastrophic wars . 
  the formatting of the letter was a big issue only on this sub because the guy who opened it did n't have adobe reader installed . . 
   personally , i think this one is likely the most authentic :  http://pbs.twimg.com/media/ciwieymw8aam1ho.jpg you just wanted to post this shit meme , did n't you ? 
  no need for a throw away account man , you 'd get buried in karma . 
  oh boy , you 're brave :p, 
  [ lol ] ( http://polandball.cc/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/dt1wetf-600x1672.png ), 
   when it 's so that the us as an actually sovereign nation/financially sound one guaranteeing the efficacy of its security apparatus to guard the entire western world 's financial and social interests remains as such , yeah , sure . 
  you do realise this is totally subjective , right ? 
  can anyone find an actual resolution/announcement by the council of europe regard the greek referendum ? 
  a press release [ in their website ] ( http://www.coe.int/en/ ) ? 
  anything ? 
  have the country members voted ? 
  if not , mr. general secretary should take his personal opinion and stick it up his arse . 
  the pope already weighed in . 
  we are patiently waiting for greenpeace , the security council of the un and eurovision to offer us valuable advice on how we should vote . 
  i am sure you are equally critical of the us government when they say fuck off to the un and other international organisations . 
  `` lol , we 're not going to question the legitimacy of a referendum in great fuckin ' britain . 
  greece on the other hand ... '' - council of europe, 
  much like most countries . 
  if / r/europe wants to be governed by ultra-majority governments they are free to move to russia or turkey #hehehehehehe, 
  because we live in a capitalist system . 
  the rich have the power . 
  sure . 
  but still , it 's not like the simple people in greece have the power to enforce such measures by themselves . 
  why do n't the americans change the ridiculous tax evasion of the 1 % ? 
  why do n't the british tax the multinationals ( starbucks , etc ) that have been evading billions ? 
  [ here is a bloomberg article for you ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-06-12/syriza-seeking-greek-shipping-billions-seen-risking-60-000-jobs ) . 
  notice the blatantly pro-shipowner tone of the headline and the article . 
   `` you can not squeeze and tackle a person that is in international shipping trade and finance and say , ` i will tax you , ''' said restis , who controls a fleet of more than 200 vessels . 
  `` the answer is ` sure , tax me . 
  find me . ''' [ bloomberg , 2012 ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-06-12/syriza-seeking-greek-shipping-billions-seen-risking-60-000-jobs ) i ca n't find jean-claude * `` friend of the people '' * juncker or any other eu official in the article protesting against greek capitalism . . 
  but ok , let 's forget about the past 5 years . 
  i sincerely hope this particular bullet is included in the final agreement and the government tries to tax the shipowners . 
  i am sure the eu institutions will help us when they change their flag and settle in rotterdam and oslo #not, 
  when was it a commitment ? 
  when did the troika visit athens for their monthly reviews of the programme and said `` gee , i see you have n't taxed the shipowners . 
  i 'm going to cut the funding '' ? 
  never . 
  you 're so ignorant it 's not even funny . . 
   uhm . . it is an actual term for providing loans to greece and icluded in the ` yes ' . 
  umm ... 
  i 've been living in this country for 26 years and i 've closely followed what 's happening since 2010 . 
  it never happened in 5 years of memoranda and obedient greek governments , it 's not going to happen now . 
   ah , that 's the proofs !!!!!!!!!! 1111 !!, 
  there is no need for ` proof ' , the fact that latsis and the rest of greek big capitalists remain not only untouched but in fortune 500 lists and the such , while the country is in shit , is proof enough . 
  as i wrote in another thread :  many employers in greece are threatening lock-outs or have already started giving unpaid leaves . 
  others are heavily pressuring their employees vote ` yes ' and to attend the ` yes ' rally today . 
  in a big law firm - which coincidentally had business with greece 's privatisations - they even told their interns : `` you do n't need to actually work this week , just convince as many as you can to vote ` yes ' '' . 
  and it 's not from hearsay , but from sources very close to me . 
  why ? 
  if you have n't heard that many , many employers have been doing this since saturday you must live in another planet . 
   the shipping companies actually support putting a tax on them ? 
  to the point of forcing their employees to go and demonstrate for putting a tax on them ? 
  while the government has been opposing doing that ?
