  \u03a4he shipping companies are n't going to be taxed in the event of a ` yes ' vote and a deal with the creditors . 
  the troika never actually pressured to tax them . 
  it 's just cheap lies and propaganda by juncker and co for the european taxpayers . 
  in fact , juncker 's predecessor barroso [ was a personal friend of latsis ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getdoc.do?pubref=-//ep//text%20wq%20e-2010-4761%200%20doc%20xml%20v0//en ) , greece 's largest shipping and banking tycoon . 
  adonis georgiadis , former maritime minister , new democracy mp and probably the most hysterical proponent of a ` yes ' vote , has repeteadly argued against the left-wing for no taxes to shipowners , because otherwise they `` can just change their flag and leave the country '' . 
  implying the eu represents the interests of the working people . . 
  many employers in greece are threatening lock-outs or have already started giving unpaid leaves . 
  others are heavily pressuring their employees vote ` yes ' and to attend the ` yes ' rally today . 
  in a big law firm - which coincidentally had business with greece 's privatisations - they even told their interns : `` you do n't need to actually work this week , just convince as many as you can to vote ` yes ' '' . 
  you 've been copy-pasting the same comment for 2 days now . . 
  please stop spamming . 
  ` europe ' ( more accurately : the eurozone ) was in it from the start . 
  they wanted greece and other small countries in the ez to set up shop . 
  if they were genuinely angered at greece in 2010 , they should have let us default . 
  but they did n't , because the banks that they serve would lose billions , so instead they went with the bailouts that transferred the debts to european taxpayers . 
  ireland was the star child of the neoliberals during the 2000s as well , with the myth of ` the celtic tiger ' . 
  no , this happened in 2010 . 
  read the fucking article . 
  just what we needed in this sub , more ignorant americans with their dank memes . 
  according to timothy geithner . 
   if ordinary slovaks would have any real power , they would strangle greeks long time ago , and kicked them our from eu , without any ceremony . 
  lmao . 
   the thing is , what this has showed is that europe is more than willing to come to the aid of it 's members when they are in trouble . 
  yeah , right ...  the europeans came into that meeting basically saying : `` we 're going to teach the greeks a lesson . 
  they are really terrible . 
  they lied to us . 
  they suck and they were profligate and took advantage of the whole basic thing and we 're going to crush them , '' was their basic attitude , all of them ... . 
  amazing how this article fails to mention the massive difference in cost of living between greece and these countries . 
  edit : -11 score , no replies . . 
  it seems / r/europe 's eastern european circlejerk got a little mad from the lack of attention to russia and decided to focus their hate on greece instead , 
  thank you . 
  good luck to the portuguese people !, 
  kke also suggested to add a 2nd addition , to ask `` do you want a complete secession from the eu '' . 
  i would n't suggest that personally . 
  it would get 70 to 90 % no anyway . 
  sorry , but kke 's proposal is a role playing game , not a referendum question ...  pps . 
  also the neutral `` do you want our or theirs ? '', 
  would also give syriza 's almost 90 % because the opposition would just say `` yours of course , it 's only slightly better '' but that would n't trap people to to their loaded question and accuse them later to be `` agents '' of the `` evil foreigners '' . 
  the only problem being theirs ( syriza ) proposal was rejected , even though it was quite similar to the troika 's and not one bit socialist . 
  the troika 's proposal as put in referendum was `` take it or leave it '' . 
  interesting , thanks . 
  why are the left bloc and communist party so low in the polls ? 
  your personal preferences aside , would n't it be logical for them to get the protest vote from how the 2 major parties handled the bailout ? 
  every referendum is biased . 
  uk 's referendum is biased towards leaving , scotland 's the same . 
  if they were n't biased there would n't be a referendum in the first place . 
  wow , i did n't know geithner 's account of that g7 meeting . 
  sch\u00e4uble is one nasty piece of work . . 
  are the socialists in portugal anti-austerity ? 
  i have n't followed portuguese politics much lately . 
  is kirchner ` extreme left ' though ? 
  and yeah , that 's why i said leftist and not left-wing or radical left . 
  they 're not socialists or communists , but the imf is a forbidden word in latin america . 
  another low point for the spd . . 
  they should really change their name at some point . 
  it 's a disgrace to the fine men and women that have been members of the spd since 1863 , some of them jailed and murdered for their beliefs . 
  you are correct , i edited my post . 
  still , really poor choice of words from juncker . 
  \u0391re we against wikileaks now ? 
  i edited my post btw , because i ca n't find a source . 
  [ from the guardian live feed ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jun/29/greek-crisis-stock-markets-slide-capital-controls-banks-closed-live#block-5591351de4b06a6b6a3f7f15 ), 
  everyone is emotional about something . 
  have you seen the hysteria in this sub regarding ukraine-russia ? 
  or immigration ? 
  being emotional about your country 's economic future is far more normal than being emotional about the future of christianity and white race in europe . . 
  * sincerely yours , * * jean-claude juncker , angela merkel , antonis samaras , mariano rajoy , pedro coelho , enda kenny *, 
  he 's unbelievable . 
  even now , not a word of self-criticism or regret . 
  and threatening greece with economic * suicide * in a country that has suffered ~ ~ 11,000 ~ ~ a high number of suicides since 2010 . . 
  especially since estonia , latvia , slovakia and the rest of the small countries with no political/military clout are going to be the last to get anything back , if at all , in case of a greek default . 
  luckily the ec ca n't overrule national parliaments for now . 
  what he probably meant is that such measures were in no way passable by the current greek parliament . 
  raising tourism vat to 23 % * in the midst of tourist period * is insanity . 
  it could n't be passed by this or any other parliament . 
  and the creditors knew this . 
  and it worked so well that almost all * latam * american countries now have leftist , anti-imf governments ... 
  it 's going to be close . 
  there are n't actually any new polls after friday 's announcement so we do n't have a clear picture yet . 
  that 's different than saying `` greeks were showing off then and they 're playing victims now '' . 
  do we blame the homeless brazilians too , just because brazil got the wc and the olympics ? 
  here is a taste of european freedom , romania . 
  [ and the greek left back then was against the olympics from the start . 
  ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sis6pv-zhzc/u-ywzq5b26i/aaaaaaaahbk/72je6gdz2cq/s1600/synaulia_afs.gif ) i do n't remember the eu having any objections . 
  the same pasok government that organised the olympics was the one that got us into the eurozone . 
  and please stop addressing greece and the greeks as if we are a monolithic entity with one voice and one opinion . 
  you do realise the first bailout was forced on us ? 
  the creditors had 1000 times more to lose than greece . 
  so spare us the moralistic bullshit , they were n't helping greece then and they 're not helping now . 
   amend and implement the legal framework for the declaration of assets and financing of the political parties what has the financing of political parties have to do with anything ? 
  that sounds like * mucho populismo * by the ec . 
  does the european commission publish the list of lobbyists in brussels and how much they pay its members and europarliament mps ? 
  there is no official source for that because that 's direct meddling in a sovereign country 's internal affairs and near treason for the greek politicians participating in these talks . 
  but the willingness of the european socialist party to shamelessly ditch their historic member pasok and accept the neoliberal potami in their ranks speaks volumes . 
  i saw some anxious faces coming to work , but i find that people are a lot more composed and cool than the pictures of atms suggest . 
  and even among those queueing up to get some cash there a lot who say they 're going to vote `` no '' . 
  we shall see . 
  they were also going to propose a solution for the debt . 
  lmao . 
  what stopped them from doing so in the last 3 years ? 
  being liberal in some social issues such as gay marriage and immigrant rights is not the same as being left-wing .
