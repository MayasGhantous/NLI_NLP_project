  reddit user / u/savannajeff is an example of this . 
  find me one major difference in economic matters between social democracy , christian democracy and liberals in the last 20 years in the eu . 
  the european social democracy can be described as centrist at best , nowhere close to left-wing though . 
  no he is n't . 
  they just got mayors elected in madrid and barcelona some weeks ago . 
  which , coincidentally , is about the same time we stopped seeing all the * `` podemos are dying '' * articles in / r/europe . . 
  the troika insisted on 23 % vat for the islands . . 
  relax , senator mccarthy . 
  source ? 
  \u0399 found the number 614.053 for 2013 and i am sure there are even less now due to all the retirements . 
  in 2013 that accounted for 11,4 % of the workforce , way lower than sweden ( 30 % ) , denmark ( 29 % ) , france ( 21,4 % ) , uk ( 17,8 % ) and only slightly higher than ireland ( 11 % ) , netherlands ( 10,7 % ) and germany ( 10,2 % ) . 
  yeah , it 's so united in the migrant issue . . 
   it is the ultimate humilation being told not to spend more than you earn . 
  you have no clue . 
  the greek debt is public , not private . 
  the greek people were spending very much according to what they earned . 
  now go and play your stupid fantasy videogames because obviously you know shit about real world economics . 
  it did n't happen 5 years ago because the eu and the imf with the help of papandreou forced the first bailout down our throats . 
  they wanted it more than we did . 
   in hides the fact the proposal of syriza is almost identical to troika 's yet it only asks `` do you want troika 's proposal '' which directs people to negative feelings and the government 's ` no ' . 
  if that 's the case then why did the institutions not agree to the government 's plan ? 
  700 000 public servants ? 
  is that what you think is the number in greece ? 
  oh man they 've been feeding you some real shit . . 
   here 's my take what happened . 
  `` here 's my take on what happened , based on my complete lack of knowledge on greek matters , that i formed by browsing reddit and reading a couple of articles on the internet '' . 
  i think so . 
  yeah , we got debit cards . 
  i do n't own a credit card , i use a simple card to get money from the atm . 
  i am against credit cards in general , having lived the glorious 2000s with their easy credit ( and debt ) . 
  it 's going to be a long night in the parliament . . 
   austerity does pay off what that does even mean ? 
  it 's a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
  obviously , if you set the basic income at 300 $ there will be many companies willing to invest and `` austerity will have paid off '' . 
  i am not talking about ireland here , i am talking about the general meaning of this claim that 's being repeated ad nauseam here . 
  is that what the eu is about ? 
  a race to the bottom for the working people ? 
  in that case , tough luck , china and india are going to win in the long term . 
  thanks . 
  these freak cases of people not working , etc can be found everywhere . 
  i 've heard first hand horror stories from countries like germany or norway , both in the private and the public sector . 
  the difference is that greece 's economy has been scrutinised 24/7 for 5 years , with the exact goal of finding such cases in order to make the headlines of the news for propaganda purposes . 
  lol , people do n't have cash on them all the time . 
  if he was caught getting 10000 euros or something like that , sure , point the finger . 
  but if i want to go for a drink later tonight , i 'm going to have to hit an atm and get the 50 euros i mentioned in the other post , because i do n't have any cash on me . 
  more like [ * non , je ne regrette rien * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3kvu6kgp88 ), 
  shit clich\u00e9 rating : 100, 
  as opposed to such titans as hollande , rajoy and monti/renzi . 
  because implementing cuts , stealing from the poor and kicking people out of their houses is the ` tough road ' . 
  bull . 
  shit . 
  maybe we should call that senator with the mafia connections to help us out , lol . 
  the difference being papandreou was the one who got us into this fucking mess . 
  he tied our hands behind the back and handed us and the future generations over to the creditors ( which were mainly ** banks ** then ) . 
  i hope there are trials for papandreou and co once things get calmer . 
  also , the left back then ( both kke and syriza ) criticised papandreou , but still said that if the referendum took place , they would vote `` no '' . 
  the frenchies ( dsk , sapin ) now express second thoughts over greece 's treatment . 
  what a spineless bunch . 
  \u0399 am defiantly keeping my 50 euros in the bank . 
  * raises fist *, 
  implying that the pro-memorandum parties had a majority ... because they sure as hell did n't . 
  if this was about us ngos everyone here would be like `` lol conspiracy theorist gtfo '' . 
  that 's some ridiculous cold war hysteria getting upvoted here . 
  russia is funding greenpeace and hippies to destroy american culture !, 
  no former yugoslav in the title ? 
  `` swedish is n't a race ! '', 
  3 and 6 are betrayed by the accents , 
  that 's true . 
  although i remember they were cozying up to the supposed ` democratic opposition ' . 
  [ source . 
  ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/04/russia-far-right-nationalists_n_1075687.html )  `` stop feeding the caucasus '' was one of the catchphrases of friday 's march . 
  it was printed on banners and repeated by speakers -- including popular anti-corruption whistleblower alexander navalny , who originally came up with the phrase . 
  i do n't believe there are any far left militiamen on the ukrainian side . 
  but it 's true that on the rebels ' side there are internal conflicts and different factions , for example mozgovoy , who i do n't think was murdered by kiev . . 
  those evil ruskies . 
  what are they going to do next ? 
  bomb the us with books on climate change ? 
  [ needs more greece .

  no point arguing in these threads , mate . 
  they only exist for that reason . 
  they supposedly start as anti-putin , then someone will mention how russia was also responsible for ww2 and they devolve into eastern european nationalist circlejerks . 
  germany would n't invade poland if britain-france did n't pull down their pants in munich and in the spanish civil war . 
  it was made clear to stalin that the west did n't want an anti-axis alliance with the ussr , so they did what they thought was best for them . 
  just check reddit . 
  it 's probably the same people anyway . 
  how can vice have so good documentaries yet so shitty articles ? 
  [ it 's uncanny ... ] ( http://files.newsnetz.ch/story/2/6/1/26169416/1/topelement.jpg ), 
  it 's sad the only reasonable anti-eu criticism in britain comes from ukip . 
  i really hope labour splits and a decent left-wing party comes out of it . 
   this blog is a rather ` extreme ' and biased that 's the shitty state eu politics have come to . 
  mainstream , centrist , keynesian economists such as mcwilliams and varoufakis are considered extreme . 
  well , the eu is making it very difficult for the pro-eu brits to support it at the moment . 
   forget tourism abroad . 
  that would be the least of their worries , many ca n't even afford to go to the islands . 
  the spaniards , portuguese , italians and many others at this point are just waiting for bad boy tsipras to take one for the team and veto sanctions so they can resume normal relations with russia . 
  ah , the classic passive-aggressive `` we do n't really care about you '' by the american redditors of / r/europe . 
  so that 's why obama was ready to intervene on monday if the negotiations failed , right ? 
  unemployment benefits : nah , not really . 
  you have to be registed as having been employed for some time to be eligible for unemployment benefits , and that 's pocket money which only lasts for some months .
