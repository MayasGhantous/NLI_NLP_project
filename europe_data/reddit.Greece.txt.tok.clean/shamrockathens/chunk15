  huge pension system : it 's only huge exactly because there are n't really any other benefits for people of older age . 
  so they just put everything under pensions . 
  they have even slashed the private \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 ( complementary ) pension funds , which is money our parents paid for from their pockets . 
  tourism : is it really an advantage to have tourism as your main money maker ? 
  the vast majority of us do n't have a room to let in mykonos or santorini - heck , i have n't even * been * to mykonos or santorini . 
  strong welfare state : again , not really . 
  the ` unmarried daughters ' and similar weird laws are the exception , and they only created those to have some kind of benefits without calling it a benefit . 
  the northern countries have welfare states we have n't imagined here , not even during the supposedly ` party years ' . 
  the only reason you know of all the ` unmarried daughter ' stuff is because every single cornercase of the greek economy has been scrutinised for the last 5 years . 
  greek right-wing newspapers and tabloids like the bild find one greek old lady who exploited a loophole to trick the system and try to generalise it , it 's propaganda . 
  they 're salty because of euro 2004 . 
  greek tourism in portugal boomed back then ^ joking ^ guys ^  seriously though , there is only like one guy who is a troll , the rest are reasonable even when they 're pro-austerity and most of the portuguese users are supportive and sympathetic towards us greeks . 
  i find that 's true for all of the southern nations , including ireland which is a honorary southern country . 
   employment benefits , a huge pension system , booming tourism , a strong welfare state , etc. 
  lol . 
  edit : sorry for the unconstructive `` lol '' , but it 's hard to try and seriously argue when you have such a distorted view of today 's greece . 
  i am going to post a longer commentary on the article 's points later . 
  oh yes , it 's huge here . 
  the church has really tried to keep it relevant too , what with finding obscure saints in christian history with ancient greek ( i.e. 
  pagan ) names . 
  did you know there was a [ saint alexander ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_of_constantinople ) ? 
  apparently there are [ plenty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_alexander ) , even a pope !, 
  not really . 
  they may be more popular in that area ( for example dimitrios in thessaloniki or spyros in corfu ) but most children are given the name of one of their grandparents . 
  the pre-socratics were the real shit though . 
  the tombstone of logic is you believing and propagating all those bullshit ` leaks ' . 
  no wonder all the greece-bashing crowd is upvoting you . 
  `` all of a soodden '' . 
  is that english ? 
  you are western . 
  or southern , when you 're in an economic crisis . 
  because that 's the western world 's boogeyman now . 
  [ relevant cartoon by joe sacco . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2015/jan/09/joe-sacco-on-satire-a-response-to-the-attacks ), 
   drinking alcohol is not an attack against muslims . 
  giving women equal rights is not an attack against muslims . 
  and drawing mohammed is not an attack against muslims . 
  one of those things is not like the others . 
  how is lowering my salary as an employee in the private sector going to help the greek state to pay its public debt ? 
  when romanian cs and ee universities rank better than the greek ones come tell me that greek engineers are n't worth their salary . 
  or when romanian medicine universities stop accepting all the greek wannabe-doctors that could n't get in the greek public uni . 
  you 're a poor troll . 
  `` serious eli5 '' when it 's obvious you just want to peddle petty jealousy and hatred . 
  they 're downvoting because you are clueless . 
  competitiveness is completely different than `` growing your own food '' . 
  1 ) i 'm going to reverse the question : why do n't romanians ask for more ? 
  salaries in the private sector are a function , among other things , of the negotiating power of labour . 
  i 'd guess the romanian trade unions are weaker than the greek ones . 
  2 ) what has the greek * public * debt got to do with what my employer , which is a * private * company , is paying me ? 
  if the company i work for is making a profit , why should n't they pay me a fair salary ? 
  3 ) the logic of the lowest common denominator that some users have reminds me of why the eu leading powers chose to expand eastward : [ social dumping ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_dumping ) on a european level . 
  thanks . 
  does `` radikale venstre '' really mean `` radical left '' ? 
  what 's up with that , danes ? 
  yep . 
  nordicism is a hell of a drug . 
  * `` first comes a full stomach , then comes ethics . 
  really ? 
  seriously , why do n't any normal swedes use reddit and we get all the * politically incorrect * misanthropes ? 
  prices jumped through the roof in one night when we joined the euro . 
  it is n't a dominant narrative , but it 's not totally unheard of either . 
  for example , [ this recent article in * die welt * ] ( http://www.welt.de/geschichte/article142305296/griechenland-zerstoerte-schon-einmal-europas-ordnung.html ) basically claims that because modern greeks are supposedly a mixture of byzantines ( sic ) , albanians and slavs , they ca n't possibly be trusted and that western europe has once again been betrayed by its misguided philhellenism . 
   in reality all other member states would still be free to meet without greece and institute sanctions anyway . 
  in reality , once the first member state decides to lift the sanctions , all the other skeptics will follow . 
  italy has already mentioned the sanctions as a bargaining chip in the immigration debate . 
  they knew very well those numbers were unreachable . 
  projecting gdp * growth * while implementing austerity and cuts everywhere ? 
  come on . 
  their intention was to sugar the pill for the greeks and to help the government to pass the measures . 
  do you have the projections for ireland ? 
  were they accurate ? 
  what about r\u00f3is\u00edn murphy ? 
  good work . 
  let 's bookmark this for the next time we are asked for ` proof ' that the imf has been bullshitting the public since 2010 . 
  it 's like the millionth time an article has been written about it though . 
  can someone from italy eli5 the whole mafia-illegal waste industry that 's been going on in napoli ? 
  and i 'd prefer living in monaco , if i had the money . 
  hehehehehe, 
   `` greek grammar with dutch words '' more accurately , * ancient * greek grammar . 
  we have n't had no dativ in greek for a long time . 
  / r/portugal in denial i see . 
  you 're not an island !, 
  the eu and the governments of its leading countries . 
  and the imf . 
  salaries do n't match productivity . 
  if this were the case then salaries should have exploded in the last 30 years . 
  yeah , it 's always the greek people 's fault in this sub , but somehow you are the ones constantly bitching about evil russian occupation non-stop . 
  case in point : your reply to / u/neutrolgreek . 
  you preach about self-responsibility to the others but when it comes to your own country 's shortcomings , you 're blaming someone else . 
  as for your simplistic version of greek history , yeah , how lucky we were to be the first who joined nato . 
  we got ` rewarded ' with a 7 year dictatorship and the invasion of cyprus . 
  italy was ` rewarded ' with bombings , false-flag operations and the destruction of all its political parties which brought forward the berlusconi era . 
  de gaulle must have been so stupid to pull out of the military branch , if only there were the eastern european nato-mujahideen of / r/europe to put him in his place . . and please tell me , how many billion euros have the eastern european countries received by the eu ? 
  a lot . 
  but whenever anyone mentions that : `` muh russia , muh ussr '' . 
  it was sarcasm . 
  i thought it was obvious but given the number of downvotes , i guess not . 
  * `` the wogs begin at calais '' *, 
  when we 're talking about immigration , the only border countries are italy , greece , bulgaria , spain and malta .
