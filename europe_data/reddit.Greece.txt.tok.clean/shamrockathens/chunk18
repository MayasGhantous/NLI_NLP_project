  heh , same thing here . 
  `` lock up your grandparents '' is a joke whenever we have elections . 
   looks west ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
   the majority of americans probably could n't even find their shitty little backwater on a map . 
  and you 're proud of that ? 
  also , it 's not like the `` shitty little backwater '' attacked the us , it was the opposite that happened . 
  southern italian bros keeping it real . 
  if you have the money/credit card , get nba league pass . 
  they offer monthly subscriptions and a subscription just for the finals . 
  you can watch on your tablet and you can set final scores to ` off ' so that you can watch the match in the morning after it has finished with no spoilers . 
  although unfortunately sometimes the generic news page will have an image of curry smiling or something and you 'll have a clue of who won = /, 
  just do n't show exhibit c to the slovenians . 
  because the us automobile industry lobbied hard to ditch the trains in favour of cars . 
  barroso is regularly chilling in [ latsis ' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spiros_latsis ) yacht . 
  that 's why we laugh every time the eu is angrily telling us we should make the rich greeks pay . 
  also in europe , although it 's unclear where cia 's involvement ended and nato started . 
  coups in cyprus , greece , turkey , plus [ gladio ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_gladio ) was a thing . 
  this would be considered / r/conspiracy material today , but it was a reality during the cold war . 
  still singing slavery 's praises ? 
  i remember seeing a group of violent polish anarchists in a party in athens ( exarchia , for those who know ) some years ago . 
  they were very anticommunist though . 
  would you use the poster 's nationality as an ad hominem if he were from another country ? 
  or are you just going for that sweet greece-bashing karma ? 
  i see how stefanos ' comment can be seen as kind of racist but i have n't noticed such sensitivity when the joke is concerning muslims for example and the person making the joke is from a random northern european country . 
  as opposed to timothy snyder who has no agenda whatsoever . 
  also the little fact that while hitler and mussolini were causally praised by western media , politicians , aristocracy , industrialists ( anyone remember `` in italy the trains run on time '' or henry ford ? 
  ) , the ~ ~ ussr ~ ~ communists and socialists were the first ones to * actually fight * hitler , in spain . 
  or when lithuania happily accepted vilnius as a gift * from the ussr , * after * the molotov-ribbentrop pact . 
  * more precisely , in exchange for soviet military presence in lithuania, 
  and what about the women ? 
  both are well-known facts in this sub , comrade , 
  is it true that anyone who dared tackle putin is going to be executed ? 
  r/stormfront leaking again . 
  you are welcome !, 
  ha , did n't know it was so famous . 
  you mean those who are of russian ethnicity ? 
  hardly what comes to someone 's mind when talking about immigration in today 's europe . 
  they 're immigrants because you 're still in denial and deny them citizenship . 
  those russians are n't going to leave , populations have been moving from one place to another for thousands of years , both peacefully and by force . 
  if you want to be advanced and nordic you should probably make them proper citizens . 
  unless you 're going to kick them out , give them incentives to leave or make a population exchange * a la * greece-turkey . 
  it seems to me that the eastern european countries want all of the eu 's benefits without any of the negative consequences . 
  bonus points because they have already done it . 
   romas and jews murdered by the soviets we know about the expulsion of ethnic germans ( which also happened in non-communist countries such as the netherlands and czechoslovakia ) but when did the soviets murder roma and jews ? 
  the clash - london calling, 
  for sweden : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj_9cinkkn4, 
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uopzrgbjzxq * cringe *, 
  bella ciao is my favourite italian song . 
  stuff like eros ramazzotti is too cheesy for me . 
  except when it comes to immigrants . 
  the italian cinecitt\u00e0 used to be big . 
   again , nothing wrong with being an economic refugee , but they 're about as `` genuine refugees '' as greeks fleeing from their incompetent government . 
  no it 's not the same . 
  greeks do n't live in fear of crazy guys cutting their heads off . 
  i do n't understand how a ` genuine refugee ' is supposed to not look for a job when he safely gets to another country . 
  many of those people from syria are civilised and educated folk . 
  because dismantling the public power company , which is the biggest company in the balkans , makes no sense . 
  also , the private sector companies that tried to participate in the distribution of electricity to households a couple years ago proved to be conmen and are now in trial . 
  also not greece , when we have a soviet-style communist party scoring 5-10 % and the neonazis of golden dawn with equally high percentages . 
  i am also curious how left they would consider syriza to be . 
  is there mandatory military service in belgium ? 
  defense budget does n't say much if you do n't have personnel and if you take into account we already have a shitload of weaponry . 
  not to mention other factors that would be important in a war such as terrain , etc. 
  btw i do n't share reddit 's hard on for military porn and i hate the fact that i 'm getting conscripted next year , but i think rankings such as this one and the various pisa educational ones are very iffy . 
  if you watched the * americans * you would know , 
  especially when the dutch person starting it sets the good example by only thanking his 3 germanic buddies . . :p, 
   continental europe still has n't forgiven us for iraq . 
  sure there was outrage and huge demonstrations against the war in 2003 , and blair is not exactly loved , but from what i have seen in the british media you seem to bring it up more frequently than continental europe . 
  nice . 
  russian patriotism is old-fashioned and pompous and can be easily ridiculed in the eyes of a western audience , as shown by oliver . 
  but yeah , i think the americans are just as patriotic , in the good or the bad sense . 
  dammit \u0399 knew i forgot someone . 
  contribution to eu does n't take into account the long term changes in economies , free trade agreements , etc. 
  sure , germany has paid a lot of cash for the eu funds but they have also profited immensely from having a huge market for their products . 
  it 's not like japan had a choice . . 
  just waiting for the first comment on how thracians were ancient greeks/bulgarians/romanians / albanians/serbs for the shitstorm to begin . 
  just shows that the newer members take the eu more seriously than they should , lol . 
  the crowd was laughing at russian hyper-patriotism when the us are just as bad . 
  the star spangled banner is played before every other nba game ffs . 
  `` the next highlight is brought to you by the american navy '' , `` let 's show support for our boys in iraq !! '', 
  etc , etc. 
  the germans and france want a conflict with russia ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  the nordics are n't even in the eu and/or nato so i do n't see how there can be a common army with them . 
  just going to leave this here ...  on 19 september 1939 , vilnius was seized by the soviet union ( which invaded poland on 17 september ) . 
  ** the ussr and lithuania concluded a mutual assistance treaty on 10 october 1939 ** , with which the lithuanian government accepted the presence of soviet military bases in various parts of the country . 
  ** on 28 october 1939 , the red army withdrew from the city to its suburbs ( to naujoji vilnia ) and vilnius was given over to lithuania . 
  a lithuanian army parade took place on 29 october 1939 through the city centre . 
  the lithuanians immediately attempted to lithuanize the city , for example by lithuanizing polish schools . 
  before giving history lectures , the lithuanian government can maybe explain why some years ago [ they prosecuted old jewish ladies with war crime charges ] ( http://www.thejc.com/news/world-special-reports/the-holocaust-survivors-facing-war-crimes-trials ) . 
  those ladies were young girls during the war and joined the soviet partisans in order to save their lifes and yet the lithuanian state prosecutor saw fit to accuse them of being nkvd spies . 
  also accused was [ yitzhak arad ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yitzhak_arad ) , a lithuanian jew and the former chairman of israel 's holocaust museum . 
  \u0399 will never not upvote this . 
  all i could see was italian girls :p, 
   victory day is celebrated on 8th may in europe , we did it yesterday . 
  it 's the same celebration , the surrender of german forces in berlin and defeat of the third reich . 
  that 's why the british and the other western countries send delegations to moscow and vice versa , or at least they did before they discovered in 2015 that putin is a bad man . 
  maybe the baltic countries should finally decide whether it was good that the nazis were defeated or not . 
  for example , the lithuanian government stated some days ago that `` we did n't participate in ww2 and therefore victory day means nothing to us '' . 
   some of them were forced to join the axis due to soviet agression .
