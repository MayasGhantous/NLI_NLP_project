  hmm , i do n't see how this is related to what i wrote , but anyway . 
  i agree that modern greece relies too much on its ` ancient glory ' for its image and yeah , in a cultural sense modern greece is much more related to the byzantine empire than to ancient greece . 
  descendants of the ottomans ? 
  not really , those few who had converted to islam were sent to turkey as part of the population exchange of 1923 . 
  the scale is massively different . 
  also , judging from most people here , poland and the neighbouring countries actually welcome ukrainian immigrants so i do n't see how this can be compared to italy or greece . 
  i thought we were talking about immigration . 
  europe herself was a phoenician ( lebanese ) princess , ironically . 
  no , they claim the current german government is not really german ( whatever that means ) and that merkel is a communist controlled by the jews . 
  spain , italy , greece and bulgaria are realistically the only border countries . 
  edit : and malta, 
  [ tinos ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tinos ) apparently has a catholic majority . 
  some other islands have catholics too , relic of venetian and frankish rule . 
  balkans begin with fyrom . 
  [ we follow the slovenian system . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwdrhqnz9lo ), 
  we use ` europe ' like the british use it , except we are part of the continent :p, 
  is that tinos ? 
  i thought syros had more catholics . 
  he is hated now that his opinion is perceived as being somewhat ` pro-greek ' . 
  i am sure when he was the boss his words were taken as gospel here . 
  so juncker , eternal head of eurogroup , dictator of luxemburg and current commission president , is one of the bad guys now ? 
  sorry , did n't get the memo . . 
  just do n't mention * 300 *, 
   and how will you deal with the corrupted policemen who supported gd ? 
  are there some nice good old purges in the services ? 
  ha , one can only dream . 
  the greek state apparatus has been notoriously continuous in its hard-right beliefs since at least the 1940s - the nazi collaborators were freed and armed in order to fight the left-wing resistance groups and then they became part of the state . 
  i did n't vote for syriza , exactly because i do n't think they have the political will to make any drastic changes in these areas . 
  the coalition with anel , on one hand served the immediate need to have a parliamentary majority , on the other hand can be seen as a wink of the eye to the aforementioned traditional state structures ( church , military , police , etc ) . 
  although the whole anel issue has been blown out of proportions by the media . 
  they do n't have much say in the critical areas of government , they have stressed numerous times that they are primarily anti-austerity and not right-wing and even on the social issues they are just talk , they do n't have any ` street presence ' , if you know what i mean . 
  and even in these social matters imo they are less extremist than laos , with which both ( former ) major parties collaborated in the past . 
  the opposite is also true . 
  especially since ( some ) ukrainians try to distance themselves from everything russia or soviet related . 
  i agree it 's a commont sentiment today , but the school books still idolise venizelos who was the major proponent of the campaign . 
  it 's basically more about what they do n't say than what they say . 
  [ dude ... ] ( https://www.google.gr/search?q=%cf%80%ce%b1%cf%80%ce%b1%ce%bd%ce%b4%cf%81%ce%b5%ce%bf%cf%85+%ce%b1%cf%81%ce%b1%cf%86%ce%b1%cf%84&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=740&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=zty0vzgmgoem7abcrohicq&amp;ved=0cacq_auoag ) we also recognized israel in 1990 or something . 
  also polish , which is tragic given the country 's history . 
  yeah , i am not gon na comment further on that or i 'll be called a * greek nationalist * ( lol ) or * russian shill * . 
  gold does n't mean anything , just that there is some idiot with enough money to spend on virtual thingies who agrees with op . 
  ... which the media have tried to spin as : `` syriza is pro-immigration , so that 's why immigration has increased '' . 
  i was referring to [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lake_tuz ) . 
  as a greek leftist i would very much like to agree with your comment , but the truth is the prosecution was initiated by the previous right-wing government in order to outlaw gd and get all their voters . 
   surely that was n't something the top echelon planned out . 
  that would be anyone 's initial thought , but as it turns out from checking their phone records , the gd group which murdered the rapper got the approval to do so by a gd mp , who in turn got the approval by michaloliakos ( leader ) himself . 
  oh we know very well how much of a joke the spd has become . 
  ( not because of their stance on the greek crisis , in general ), 
  yeah , but it would also be nice to start learning of the atrocities the greek army commited while advancing and the scorched earth policy it followed while retreating . 
  we had no business trying to conquer the fucking anatolian desert . 
  noone speaks of it , like noone speaks of the slavophones and their persecution . 
  there are [ slavic pagan festivals ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/koliada ) that are celebrated from kastoria to ukraine and poland and yet if you google about it you only see hilarious claims that it has roman or ancient greek origin . 
  the netherlands were n't part of the soviet union . 
  the czechoslovaks started expelling germans before they became a people 's republic . 
  and i am sure the poles had no problem taking prussia and kicking the german nobility out . 
  claiming the local populations of these countries were somehow forced to hate the germans by the ussr is the worst kind of revisionism , altering the past because in the present those countries are in better terms with germany than with russia . 
  it 's not like the western powers have issued long-winded , heartfelt apologies for their interference in other countries ' affairs . 
  the difference is that the soviet union is dead so everyone tries to stomp on its corpse while the us are still world police and noone dare call them out . 
  in before ` whataboutery ' comment , 
  wow , you are brave , haha . 
  germany and italy i can see your point , but why france ? 
   1 ) myth of friendly russia ( you havent shared border with them and you dont want to share border with them in the future ) . 
  could n't the ~ ~ serbians ~ ~ serbs claim the same about muslims/albanians/croats / etc ? 
  `` oh you talk about the rights of muslim minorities but you do n't share a border with albania '' . 
  different size of course , but the logic is the same . 
  \u0399 am sure there were innocent victims , but there is a common narrative among eastern european users here that before the russians came their respective countries were paradise on earth . 
  still searching for your lebensraum ? 
   over 15 000 people primarily from the intelligentsia were murdered while the communists came to power . 
  and how many were murdered in bulgaria , greece , yugoslavia while bulgaria was part of the axis ? 
  it 's the weekly `` gib back pru\u00dfen ! '', 
  r/europe thread for the anti-russian ( * not * anti-putin ) bigots to masturbate to . 
  nothing to see , really . 
  edit : once again the replies are anti-greek hatespeech . 
  proof that the only reason these threads exist is to rally r/europe 's bigots . 
  ` disambiguation ', 
  i am sorry , is mentioning nuland and her cringeworthy comments considered putler propaganda now ? 
  the fact that the us government have n't bothered to replace her is amazing . 
  we had been buying weapons from germany and france way before the loans started . 
  no we do n't , but it 's funny seeing this question asked when the government is considering buying russian missiles but not when we were buying german submarines . 
  because the previous imf projections were so correct . 
  politicians can be removed and convicted . 
  bankers are generally immune . 
  it does n't . 
  russia is n't any different than other european countries in that aspect . 
  and inside the russian political scene , it is n't only putin who is hypocritical , the russian opposition has casually participated in anti-putin rallies along with russian nazis ( who are believed to be the most violent in the world , btw ) . 
  \u03a5eah , maybe my phrasing was n't the best . 
  what i meant to say was that they did n't choose those symbols because they have an obscure , archaic origin but because they refer to nazism . 
  swastika can be found in a lot of ancient greek stuff but noone paid any attention to it or cared about it before it became the nazi symbol . 
  this is bs . 
  nazi congresses like the one in st. petersburg have been happening for decades now all over europe . 
  a recent example is the congress hosted by the italian neofascist forza nuova in milan , where golden dawn , npd and other nazi parties participated . 
  an interesting difference with nazi symbols is that the neonazis are constantly trying to hide it . 
  golden dawn have been repeating ad nauseam that the hitler salute is of greek origin and that their symbol was n't chosen because it resembles the swastika but because it was ancient greek . 
  similarly the azov guys in ukraine claim the wolfsangel symbol is just a traditional , mythical , whatever ukrainian symbol . 
  on the other hand , leftists and communists are usually proud to demonstrate the hammer and sickle . 
  maybe it does n't say much about the symbols and ideologies but it surely says a lot about the people bearing them . 
  yeah , those ungrateful bastards . 
   especially recently with crypto-communists like gerhard schroeder or merkel ( to whatever extent crypto can apply to her ... ) . 
  u wot m8 . 
   they were only allowed to enter because of misleading information .
