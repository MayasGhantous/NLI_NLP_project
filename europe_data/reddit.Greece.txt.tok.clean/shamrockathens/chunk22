  how dare you not know the order in which the glorious baltic states sit on the map ? 
  95 % , feckin latvia and lithuania . 
  yeah , it 's always ironic seeing germans and austrians being so cocky about them pesky balkans when they have brought so much shit to the region for the last ~ ~ 2000 ~ ~ 200 years . 
  i do n't have data on ddr 's economy and even if i had most people here would dismiss them as cooked . 
  my comment was meant to stress the fact that even in the socialist bloc there were pretty big disparities , just like there have been big disparities in the capitalist world . 
  i am aware of these articles . 
  i also remember one from the bild with the title `` in griechenland regieren jetzt die judenhasser '' . 
  the thing is , these articles were published in the first days of the papademos government and then when papademos passed the austerity measures laos was forgotten . 
  it 's also kind of ironic that voridis , which die welt 's article specifically mentions , went on to become a member of the new democracy party , an mp and a minister . 
  tbf i ca n't blame the european media when it was the greek media that put so much effort in whitewashing voridis ' and laos ' pasts . 
  why do n't you show me the articles where the media are criticising the blatant nationalism and populism of laos ? 
  that was the point of my comment anyway , not how well the greek governments were perceived in general . 
  and i do n't need a citation to prove that syriza has garnered a hell of a lot more negative press compared to the previous pasok/nd governments , anyone who has n't lived in a cave for the past 5 years knows this . 
  you 're wrong . 
  maybe now , but not while they were in power . 
  papademos was doing everything the creditors wanted . 
  as far as the other pasok/nd governments are concerned , they were frequently praised , now they are scorned because they are finished politically and useless to them . 
   a particular impression caused the attitude of slovenia , which decided not to participate because it sees itself as a country of central europe , but not in the balkans . 
  lmao . 
   having a nationalist and populist party such as anel in a coalition is utterly dangerous . 
  an even more nationalist and populist party ( [ laos ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/popular_orthodox_rally ) ) was in the papademos government , which was basically forced by the eu after the whole papandreou-in-cannes debacle ( much like what happened with monti in italy , both were technocrat bankers ) . 
  but you obviously do n't hear about that anywhere in the media , because that government was ` good ' while the current one is ` bad ' . 
  thanks !, 
  i 'm going to show them to my mother , she was studying in bucharest at the time of the earthquake . 
  she probably was close to where this picture was taken : http://estost.photoshelter.com/gallery-image/romania-life-1975-89/g0000e5xgbtlgc7w/i0000gx40p8_yrv8, 
  from 0 to 3 seas , well done serbian brothers !, 
  i laughed at * porca miseria * . 
  well played , well played . 
  afaik there are going to be representatives from a lot of eu countries , just military and not political . 
  romania has to be the worst of the european socialist bloc countries , along with albania . 
  on the other hand , i think eastern germany was better than many developing capitalist countries in terms of living standards ( work , food , education , etc ) . 
  these posts are meaningless . 
  you could try and ` prove ' anything by cherry-picking the right photos . 
  i could make an imgur album `` greece in the '50s during marshall plan versus now with syriza government '' and you 'd think greece was a living hell back then ( it * was * pretty bad actually , but that 's not the point ) compared to the present . 
  black/white versus colour photos also reinforces that feeling . 
  btw my mother studied in romania in the late '70s so please do n't lecture me , i know how bad the situation was . 
  according to r/europe , the red army was totally russian when it did bad things , but it was totally multiethnic when it did good things . 
  i have seen many ukrainians here angrily correcting russians who claim that russian soldiers won ww2 . 
  yeah , that 's the picture i have too . 
  the germans were confiscating everything after 1943 , in greece there was even a battle between partisans and the german army in order to protect the crop of thessaly . 
  [ wikipedia article for those who can read greek . 
  ] ( http://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/%ce%9c%ce%ac%cf%87%ce%b7_%cf%84%ce%b7%cf%82_%cf%83%ce%bf%ce%b4%ce%b5%ce%b9%ce%ac%cf%82 ) it 's sad that while germans are reminding people about what really happened , some polish users , from the nation most negatively affected by nazism , are defending the nazis just to make russia/ussr look worse in comparison . 
   there were no ukrainians before 1917 and their language and culture were invented by the communists and lenin specifically . 
  there is truth in that . 
  the czarist regime did n't recognize the existence of a ukrainian nation and language and it was actually the bolsheviks who encouraged the printing of literature in the ukrainian language during the 20s and early 30s . 
   during the 1920s , [ 60 ] under the ukrainisation policy pursued by the national communist leadership of mykola skrypnyk , soviet leadership encouraged a national renaissance in literature and the arts . 
  the ukrainian culture and language enjoyed a revival under ukrainisation as part of the soviet-wide policy of korenisation ( literally indigenisation ) . 
  [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukraine#inter-war_soviet_ukraine ), 
  i am pretty sure # 2 , # 3 , # 4 are basically true . 
  slavic bruthas for evah :d, 
  nah , if anything it 's the opposite . 
  there was not much mixing with turks ( because of the muslim thing obviously ) , persians never really settled here and neither did the north africans . 
  southern italians and sicilians are much more mixed in that sense and some of them look swarthy even by greek standards . 
  on the other hand , people that definitely inhabited greece were the slavs , the aromanian vlachs and the arvanites ( albanians ) which is the reason there are so many exotic-looking greeks with blonde hair/blue eyes . 
  still whiter than gypsies / jk but seriously , contrary to nazi racial myths and popular view , the `` aryans '' ( indo-europeans ) were n't as white as the swedish or the finnish are today , they were darker . 
  much of northern europe 's dna comes from indigenous hunter-gatherers of northern europe and not from the `` aryan '' invaders/neolithic farmers . 
  unlike most americans * , everyone browsing r/europe knows the context of the 1999 bombings . 
  serbian crimes do n't make those acts any less controversial . 
  * as a child during the bombings in easter of 1999 , i was going on a trip with my parents to italy and next to us on the plane there was a group of americans trying to place yugoslavia on the map . 
  it was really funny . 
  i would n't say clark is a stranger to controversy . 
  he did bomb the chinese embassy and other civilian targets during the 1999 bombings of yugoslavia . 
  yeah , these guys are basically robots . 
  i saw djiselbloem ( sp ? ), 
  in a dutch satirical show and he was kinda laughing , and i was like `` wtf ? 
  this guy actually has feelings ? '', 
  you 've been arguing on the greek debt crisis for 3-4 years ? 
  and it used to be worse than this ? 
  lmao , i admire your courage . 
   but in the western world its a statement . 
  its saying : hey !, 
  hey !, 
  hey !, 
  look at me !, 
  i am following x !, 
  look at me !!!, 
  have you considered the possibility that their husbands/parents/brothers force them to wear this stuff ? 
  these are very patriarchal cultures . 
  even if he did , this excuse could be used by any authoritarian or dictatorial regime ever . 
  `` why do you need x party/freedom , we already have you covered : wink : '', 
  he also outlawed the spd . 
  you are the one who went on a rant dude . 
   on the fringes of europe lol , you are more eastern than we are , and northern than britain . 
  on your east you have russia which * you * do n't even consider european . 
  just because you have finland and the north pole above you does n't make you the centre of europe . 
  i think they moved one of their network infrastructure departments here . 
  at least 10 people i know have been hired by nokia . 
  in general , we ( developers , it , telecommunications etc ) are the only sector that has little trouble finding a job in greece at the moment . 
  good post . 
  shame noone is going to reply to it , as most people here view russian redditors as mindless drones ( ` serf mentality ' ) , shills or western-loving good guys who agree with everything the west does and so we accept them . 
  a thoughtful anti-putin russian who tries to explain things instead of demonising and saying putin is literally hitler ? 
  we do n't want that kind of shit in here mate . . as for the racial thing , it 's a sad truth that not only do we have rampant russophobia ( parroting the old nazi theories that russians are not european but asiatic savages , claiming russia has n't offered anything good to the european civilisation - lol ) , but even anti-slavism , with people refusing to identify as slavs or eastern europeans , claiming instead they are ` central european ' , ` western ' , ` nordic ' , etc. 
  many balts even refuse the fact that their people and languages shares a common past with their slavic neighbours . 
  and all that self-hating stuff is very different than being anti-putin and wanting your society to become more advanced and similar to western europe . 
   the crisis was caused by greek irresponsibility yeah , lehman brothers , that world-famous greek company . 
  that sounds familiar . 
  in greek there is volvos ( \u03b2o\u03bb\u03b2\u03cc\u03c2 ) with similar meaning . 
  kinda off-topic , but nokia has been hiring many people in greece . 
  i guess we are considered cheap educated workforce now . . 
  what i meant to say is that whether an organization is terrorist or freedom fighters depends on context and outcome of its struggle .
