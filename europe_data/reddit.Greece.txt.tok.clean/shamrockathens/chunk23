  the anc of south africa was considered terrorist by the uk even until the last years of the apartheid rule . 
  the kurds of pyd/ypg fighting the isis in rojava are a communist terrorist organisation according to the turkish state .

  the core eurozone members are not eastern european and they do n't give a fuck about ukraine when it comes to the greek debt . 
   name one eu country which is negotiating similiar deal with russia . 
  no need to negotiate because they already have such deals in place : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nord_stream, 
  yeah , because estonia is totally who greece is negotiating with . . 
  so greece doing what half the eu countries secretly want , i.e. 
  restore economic relations with russia . 
  unlike what reddit seems to believe , russia is not heading towards an economic collapse anytime soon . 
  lol , all the governments worldwide are doing these trips on behalf/along with private businesses . 
  counterstrike would be fine , it 's those pseudo-strategy games that have done the most harm . 
   neither greeks nor communists are known for their gorgeous look wrong and wrong . 
  greek , english . 
  i can read and listen to german pretty well but i have n't spoken it in years . 
  the [ communist party of bohemia and moravia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communist_party_of_bohemia_and_moravia ) got 15 % in your general elections , that does n't seem like `` fringe extremist '' to me .

  destroying stomachs since 1957 !, 
   russia is like this cancerous growth from the east historically they have been more european than you . 
  you want to present them as ` asiatic savages ' but they actually speak a european language for starters . 
  one could say they are even * more nordic * than you as their ancient state was founded by the varangians/vikings  not to mention they have contributed much more to european culture than estonia or finland . 
  i know it 's hard to accept , especially in this subreddit , but you are not the centre of the world . 
  no love for italy and the balkans ? 
  :p i pick sicily . 
  nah , they 're usually doing a lot for this kind of stuff . 
  the amphipolis tomb fiasco is a recent example . 
  yes , but it is mainly an upper and middle class phenomenon . 
  private and public sector employees could n't evade taxation even if they wanted . 
  most who comment surely are n't , but i bet there are lots of americans lurking and voting . 
   i 'm very happy that western european colonialism does n't get glorified except by some revisionists . 
  you must not browse r/europe or r/worldnews regularly then . 
  how is the russian eastward expansion and conquest of urals-siberia different from the us expansion to the west ? 
  do the us need to undergo `` decolonization '' too ? 
  damn , i get it your are anti-russian , but trying to give the credit for stalingrad to the us is absurd . 
   zero outside help what does that mean ? 
  germany had allies too , they used the romanian oil fields , they used slave-labourers to work in some of their factories , they took forced loans from conquered countries like they did in greece , they stole gold , they stole the harvest from farmers etc. 
  also known as being * `` more royalist than the king '' * . 
   ** gallic ** nation threatens to blow europe 's ** franco ** - german axis apart so ... are they gauls or franks ? 
  wtf daily telegraph writer ? 
  in greece we call french people * galli * , so no such problems :d, 
   there are lots of left-wingers who are against the eu for political reasons , just as there are left-wingers who are in favour of retaining a nuclear deterrent . 
  yeah , it 's interesting that in the uk pro-eu is considered a leftist position . 
  reading the guardian and other traditionally left-wing publications , they seem to have a very idealised and nostalgic view of the eu . 
  unfortunately , the main reason farage has gained so much support is that there is truth behind his anti-eu rhetoric . 
  it 's sad that the left has abandoned reasonable anti-eu rhetoric and left it to ukip and the conservatives . 
   fascism and communism are twins . 
  so much so , that if national-socialism is considered a kind of fascism , so shall be communism . 
  that 's just plain wrong . 
  fascism in italy and nazism in germany came to power partly in order to crush workers ' movements , trade unions and socialist/communist parties . 
  that 's why the business classes in italy and germany supported them and funded them . 
  this is n't even comparable . 
  i am sure the vast majority of serbians are nostalgic towards the tito era . 
  and it 's not without good reason , considering 1989-1999 was how it was . 
  no , it 's just r/europe is obsessed with taking kaliningrad from russia . 
  who gets it , it does n't matter . 
  here we go again ... 
  those `` jobs '' exist for thousand years . 
  it 's called agriculture . 
  [ educate yourself !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neolithic_revolution ), 
  that 's basically the same thing russia is claiming though . . 
  it 's pretty common here to use the hands while speaking , like in italy . 
  i do it all the time instinctively . 
  imo he should n't have bothered to deny or confirm . 
   ukrainians killed jews when the nazis controlled ukraine , germany accountable . 
  nice straw man there . 
  germans were n't the only ones accountable , locals in ukraine , romania , baltics , even poland actively participated in the pogroms and the genocide against the jews * . 
  there is a well-known incident in latvia ( or lithuania , ca n't remember ) where even an ss officer was shocked by the brutality of the locals . 
  of course many eastern europeans here deny it/don ' t mention it and only blame germany and russia , but that does n't change the fact . 
  * this happened everywhere obviously , i only mention eastern european countries because they are relevant to the discussion, 
  here we go again ... 
  ah , the mythical italian anarchists . 
  they participate in our riots too , according to the greek police . 
   yep , occupation by russia is disgusting , almost like a wwii . 
   occupation by russia was worse than the german atrocities during ww2  concentration camps are nothing plus comments by redditors with usernames such as [ `` einsatzkommando '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/einsatzkommando ) . 
  the anti-russian sentiment here is disgusting . 
  and there is a big difference between being anti-putin and being anti-russian . 
  i also love the double standards : bringing up koenigsberg/kaliningrad and calling it a `` german city '' is ok , but any greek claims for ww2 reparations are outrageous and stir up nationalism from ancient times . 
  to be fair , most german replies here have been cool , it 's mostly eastern european nationalist crazies and some blatantly neonazi british accounts that are posting the aforementioned quotes . 
  national debts are also a continuous thing , they did n't magically appear when greece joined the euro . 
  the greek national debt dates back to 1830 . 
  i am sure that if other political parties had their own active subreddits they would be equally awful . 
   ( fopo ) greece it 's just greeks that have * emotional reactions * against germany and never the opposite , right ? 
  yeah , imagine if we went over to r/canada and started calling canadians names because harper is an asshole . 
  i mean the very fact that we hardly ever hear about the 1848 revolutions indicates what i wrote . 
  compare it to the us celebrations of the civil rights movement or the civil war , for example . 
  1789 is flat out considered a precursor to stalinism . 
  reminds me of the story of [ kurt vonnegut ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurt_vonnegut ) who was an american pow in dresden and then became a famous writer . 
  * slaughterhouse-five * tells the story of dresden and is a masterpiece . 
  apparently many eastern europeans think that mogherini is communist and pro-russian . . 
  i mean wtf , she is a typical eurocrat from what i 've seen of her in the news . 
  absolutely . 
  i find it interesting that the current mood among european elites is to disassociate themselves from 1789 and 1848 . 
  they were bourgeois-democratic revolutions against feudalism and monarchy after all . 
   why are there russian nuclear silos in ukraine ? 
  because ukraine was an integral part of the ussr , second only to the russian ssr . 
  they were n't a satellite state like poland or artificially annexed like the baltics . 
  people tend to forget that russia , us , israel , even france , germany , italy are countries with a significant arms industry , and those weapons that cost millions of dollars have to be used from time to time . 
  well said , sir .
