  i agree with your argument in general , but afaik east germany used to have a big industry . 
  it was de-industrialized after 1989 , i read somewhere that 3,5 million industrial jobs were lost for the east germans after the so-called reunification . 
  did greece get southern bavaria in exchange for the forced loans , looting , destruction of infrastructure ? 
  were there greek troops occupying berlin ? 
  west germany did n't even bother to convict nazis who commited war crimes in greece ffs . 
  yeah , but what about finno-ugric languages ? 
  they can not even into common etymology for mama !, 
  \u03a4he greek word for rose is '' \u1fe5\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd '' , which has the same root as in the rest of languages . 
   not really . 
  it is not that long ago when caucasus was burning and russian army was engaged to bitter fight in chechnya , dagestan , etc. . . last time they fought without external assistance and caused massive damage . 
  just think how much damage they would do with external assistance . 
  not to mention that it would n't really cost much for the west ... ** gulf arab states would gladly fund it , israel and other third party countries would provide weaponry , islamists communities around the world would gladly act as foot soldiers ** . 
  sounds like syria . 
  you get gyros only if you help us remove kebab . 
  after britain and france had refused to form an anti-fascist coalition with the ussr against nazi germany , because they hoped hitler would destroy communism . 
  also : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/munich_agreement just sayin ' . 
  history books in the us teach you that the ussr started ww2 ? 
  and yes , the equation of the crimes of nazism and communism is the official view only in the baltics and some other former warsaw pact countries . 
  not even the eu agrees to that . 
  that version of history ( [ `` double genocide '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/double_genocide#holocaust ) ) is only mainstream in the baltics . 
  stop repeating it like it 's some universal truth . 
  it 's not . 
  in fact , most jewish organisations have condemned you for this revisionism , especially after lithuania tried to arrest jewish holocaust survivors as war criminals ( [ true story ] ( http://www.thejc.com/news/world-special-reports/the-holocaust-survivors-facing-war-crimes-trials ) ) . 
  edit : of course i am getting downvoted , the eastern europeans who are a majority here love to play victims and wo n't ever accept the horrific crimes some of their ancestors commited against jews and others . 
  so , islamist afghanistan being a hellhole compared to soviet afghanistan means they should have stayed , right ? 
  you also unleashed ww2 . . til . 
  in what order ? 
  thank you based luxemburg . 
   the equivalent in germany would be as if a minister belonging to a junior coalition party went to a local party committee and told them `` do n't worry about the greeks , we 'll put them in their place and if they do n't do exactly what we want we 'll kick them out of europe '' . 
  so , the csu . 
  this is hilarious . 
  keep the greece-hate going man , it 's admirable . 
  nah , no need to actually read stuff on russian politics , we know everything already / jk, 
  it 's not in the same market as spain , italy , turkey , greece , croatia . 
  yeah , austria , the famous summer destination . 
  are you american by any chance ? 
  yep , same with greece . 
  wan na join the varangian guard ? 
  you 'll get rich and return to scandinavia with much gold ^ ^ ^ or ^ ^ ^ die, 
  russia being an eternally evil empire is already the dominant narrative in these places so most would n't have a problem bringing up the cossacks . 
  but mention belgian congo , churchill 's india or french algeria and things change . 
  the election threat is mostly directed at his opponents in greece . 
  syriza could easily have a clear majority if elections were to be had in the next few months . 
  the funny thing is that you are n't getting downvoted for the congo-ukraine comparisons , but because you 're bringing up colonialism . 
  most people here do n't want to admit europe 's horrific crimes and genocides apart from hitler and stalin , who are the ` easy ' targets . 
  we have a bunch of frankish and venetian castles in the peloponnese . 
  [ mystras ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/84155394.jpg ) is pretty cool ( byzantine ) . 
  the best preserved must be the [ knights castle in rhodes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palace_of_the_grand_master_of_the_knights_of_rhodes ) : [ photo 1 ] ( http://i269.photobucket.com/albums/jj68/bogdanovskaya2/greecerhodescastletagsofia-art.jpg ) [ photo 2 ] ( http://romeonrome.com/files/2000/10/rhodescastle.jpg ), 
   german culture had immense effect on imperial russia . 
  any examples other than catherine the great ? 
  i do n't think the czarist regime was a fan of german enlightenment or any enlightenment for that matter . 
  russia was basically a feudal country until 1917 . 
   but in the 20th century it was nothing but wiped out . 
  complete paradigm shift . 
  total eradication . 
  you know marx and engels were german , right ? 
  lenin considered germany to be the most important country for the international revolution , there was a failed but massive socialist revolution in germany and the kpd was popular prior to 1933 . 
  and then there was this country called ddr for 40 years . 
  basically you 're pulling stuff out of your ass . 
   ha , tell that to the greens ... forgot the greens !, 
  they 're right-wing too :p  but , traditionally , the `` right wing/left wing '' dichotomy is carved out along social policy , not economic policy . 
  i think that 's more relevant in america , where the only difference between democrats and republicans are ` culture wars ' regarding abortion , gun control , evolution vs creationism , etc. 
  in the us the economy has been pretty much left-out of the public debate for the last decades . 
  only now are they starting to reexamine workers ' rights , minimum wage , trade-unions , things that are obvious for europeans . 
  from an economic point of view , they are all right-wing . 
  sure , some of those ( liberals , spd ) are more left/liberal in social matters but it 's the economy that 's the most important part of a party 's programme . 
  yep . 
  the most educated greeks unfortunately emigrate . 
  and i guess we are more liked than the cypriots , 
  seriously , how are those stories any more believable than ukraine being a nazi junta ? 
  propaganda is bad , unless it 's western propaganda of course . 
   death star [ dammit , i knew they were up to something . . ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/death_star ), 
  cdu , csu , liberals and afd are all right-wing . 
  spd is supposedly centrist but has followed right-wing policies . 
  well ... 
  most greek students and workers abroad are hard-working and well-liked so it makes sense . 
  \u0391nd sorry for beating you in euro 2004 , you had the best team and deserved to win it . 
  greeks in the western coast of turkey had been living there for 2,500 years . 
  but we fucked up trying to take ankara after ww1 and they were forced to flee . 
  shit happens in history , if every country tried to ` reclaim the lost homelands ' mankind would be in a perpetual state of war . 
  mocking putin is the easiest way to free karma . 
  because gorbachev was a fool and trusted the us and the west germans to not meddle with eastern europe . 
  yeltsin was even worse . 
  russian leadership could have abolished socialism and the ussr satellite states without turning the country into a mess and an eldorado for corporate vultures and oligarchs . 
  putin is so popular because yeltsin was so shit , basically . 
   the only possible resolution now is a violent one . 
  oh look , reddit 's armchair generals are at it again . 
  the various german groups had presence almost everywhere in europe , that 's not an argument . 
  gib back marseille !, 
  yeah , lets paint a swastika on our helmets and wear ss wolfsangel insignia to troll those pesky russians . . noone else could ever feel offended , right ? 
   you say that like ** you ** can just decide to not ever take part in wars . 
  are we talking about countries or people ? 
  because i have the feeling that the armchair generals of reddit are all for a war as long as it 's the poor kids and the mercenaries who are fighting for the glorious homeland . 
  exactly , it 's because they 're kids . 
  middle-class , educated , video-game loving kids . 
  military service is compulsory in greece , if they had any idea what life in the military really looks like they would n't want any part of it . 
  i am sure there is a lot of criminality in the tough faroese ghettos . 
  that 's some metal gear solid shit right there . 
  says the ukrainian with the eu flag . . 
  czech republic and the usa are n't in a state of civil war at the moment .
