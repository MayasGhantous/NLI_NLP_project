  in reddit the civil war is presented as being solely the result of russian aggression . 
  that 's where i got that . 
  so are you saying ireland is n't the only country bordering a big country on the east and the atlantic ocean on the left ? 
  because everyone tries to hide the fact that there have been huge divisions in the ukrainian society , in order to present the donetsk situation as a result of just russian aggression . 
  just check the election results of svoboda in western ukraine , the results of the communist party in eastern ukraine , and vice versa . 
   a cultural divide within the country ehm ... that 's precisely what u/ramosspaceball 's post was meant to show . 
  there has been deep cultural , ethnic , political , religious divide in ukraine . 
  claiming this divide has been miraculously healed because poroshenko got 50 % in the last elections is short-sighted and wrong . 
   just another leader taking office . 
  poroshenko is exactly that . 
  he 's no outlier , he has been part of ukrainian 's political and economic elite for a lot of years . 
  if only the latest elections matter , then surely greece is allowed to not pay its debt . 
  we never had corrupt governments , we always voted for syriza !, 
  i agree . 
  but to be fair , there are like 5 countries in the whole world that have n't been invaded by britain at some point . 
  i see what you did there . . let me inform you we 've been enemies since at least [ 395 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alaric_i ) !, 
  damn , it must be nice to only have * one * historical enemy . 
  lol this is going to get downvoted/ignored to oblivion . 
  yeah , let 's erase 25 years of history just because it does n't fit our narrative . 
  rip . 
  a hero . 
  also , many people forget that ussr , even though it had socialist economy and a single-party system , was still a human society and as such had actual criminals in it . 
  not everyone imprisoned in the gulag system was a dissident . 
  a topic in reddit involving both greece and the bosnian war . 
  what could possibly go wrong ? 
  because saying the soviets were worse than nazis is the new cool . 
   seems the greeks have woken up from their afternoon nap . 
  i 'll keep this up though , i should get more upvotes after they settle in for the early evening nap . 
  u mad bro ? 
  maybe next time . 
  http://ukrainiancrusade.blogspot.gr/ but why accept the simple explanation ? 
  it 's obviously kgb behind it !, 
  yep . 
  `` collaboration between the public and the private sector '' ( \u03a3\u03cd\u03bc\u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\u03be\u03b7 \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03cc\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5 \u0399\u03b4\u03b9\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd \u03a4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03b1 ) , that 's what those projects are called . 
  i was referring to the whole nordic obsession , no disrespect to estonians . 
  i have heard your women are beautiful , 
  greek capitalism has been quite dominant in the balkans and greek companies used to be active in those countries . 
  also , there are strong ties between greece and serbia , and bosnia is part serbian , so . . 
  no , [ the germans were the ones bombing them ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_deliberate_force ) . 
   the german luftwaffe saw action for the first time since 1945 during operation deliberate force . 
  nice karmawhoring , though . 
  inferiority complex much ? 
  yugoslavia was n't in the middle east . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greece%e2%80%93bosnia_and_herzegovina_friendship_building unfortunately it was more of a donation to the greek construction company that built it . 
  needs more nordic master race . 
  ok , i hope you are right . 
  i prefer these `` kids '' than the northern european xenophobes who most probably hate both the immigrants from magreb and the immigrants from the med countries . 
  as if the pegida folks absolutely love greeks , italians , etc. . 
  you accepted adams as a legitimate player when you signed the agreement in order to keep ni in the uk . 
  you ca n't have it both ways buddy . 
  the only reason labour 's pr seems worse than the tories ' is that every misstep by corbyn is taken out of context , twisted and amplified x100 by the media . 
   the shadow chancellor called for ireland to be united by `` the ballot , the bomb and the bullet '' ... 30 years ago . 
  i 'd take `` united ireland '' over `` hang mandela '' any day of the week . 
   you realize immigrants are n't animals ? 
  they are people . 
  stop treating them like beasts who run on instinct gr8 b8 m8, 
  well , at least they got expelled . 
  did the tory party expel its pro-apartheid members or did they get knighted ? 
  antisemitism in europe is endemic . 
  it was n't brought by muslims , on the contrary , extreme islamists often use antisemitic tropes of european origin . 
  your point is shit . 
  especially given the fact that you do n't give a fuck about the homeless people and you just use them as a cheap argument . 
  wow , the cheapest argument ever made . 
  also , do n't you feel like a hypocrite still having this eu flair when you obviously do n't believe in any of the eu 's humanitarian values ? 
  this subreddit does n't have a problem with american articles as long as they reinforce their beliefs . 
  the irony is that the sub full of americans and trump bots since the last few months , who only post about immigration , of course . 
  what `` controversial '' issue ? 
  you mean the fake rape accusation in cologne ? 
  turns out the media waiting on the police reports before starting a witch hunt was the right thing to do . 
  i bet the elders of zion and george soros had a hand in that , amirite ? 
  it was clearly their god given right that their countries managed to sneak into the eu 10 years ago . 
  they really tried very hard for that , as opposed to these entitled immigrants . 
  lmao . 
  `` they went through hell '' ? 
  did your friends risk their lives crossing the aegean , walk the whole of europe in foot and stay for months in shitty camps ? 
  `` how dare they try to to get to the west when there are millions of eastern europeans that have n't yet migrated ?! '', 
  it is a military band . 
  insignia of army officers and of \u0393\u0395\u03a3 . 
  triggered !, 
  maybe if we did n't treat them as undesirables then fyrom would n't have grounds for such claims . 
  same story with the muslims in thrace : we 've been treating them as ` others ' and undesirables for decades , then complain when they turn to turkey for help . 
  what does it mean to be a slav ? 
  they speak a slavic language . 
  genetics are a completely different story . 
   the other 85 % would be paionian , since ancient macedonia did not include the vardar valley . 
  population genetics laugh at these miniscule distinctions . 
  slavic macedonians and greek macedonians are really close genetically . 
  you are correct . 
  linguistic differences exist but anyone who tries to use genetics as an argument is a fool . 
  i believe there are a lot of ( slavic ) macedonian people in canada , at least that 's what my dad has told me from his time living there . 
  a lot of them from the greek side of the border too . 
  is that accurate ? 
  stamkos the hockey player sounds like he is one of those . 
  rigas was ahead of his time . 
  you conveniently forget to mention the fact that a slavic macedonian minority actually exists in greece . 
  they are probably more macedonian than most of the greeks who live in greek macedonia currently and who mostly came from pontus and anatolia as refugees . 
  there * is * a slavic macedonian minority in greece and it has been treated terribly for the last 100 years . 
  arguing that this minority does n't exist is as laughable as claiming alexander was a slav . 
  member of the eu when it benefits us , `` sovereign '' when it doesnt . 
  `` you are n't a true leftist if you wear any brand-name clothes or drink coca cola ! '',
