  what happened to `` they are n't really syrians '' ? 
  this sub has gone full stormfront , that 's what happened . 
  heil / r/europe !, 
   as a greek living in germany , you 'd be shocked at the absolutely vitriolic attitude many fellow expats have for the germans . 
  even when working for them and earning x5 the money they would back home , the anger is there . 
  but its mostly shared in private , among ourselves . 
  sure , just like all the german landlords refusing to rent their apartments to greeks in the last 5 years . 
  or the people badmouthing `` the damn foreigners '' in the cafes in german , thinking we ca n't understand them . 
  it 's mutual , 
  syria and iraq are the * centres * of a terrible regional conflict . 
  how the fuck can you compare them to brazil in ww2 that was thousands of miles away from the battles ? 
  `` no way you are making australia home . 
  australia is home only to descendants of english convicts that came here 200 ago and are so maladjusted for the local climate that they get skin cancer '', 
  that 's the most stupid argument i 've ever read . 
  there was never a land battle in scotland during ww2 , only air raids . 
  seriously , this comparison is so bad it 's laughable even by trump supporter standards . 
  everyone here think they 're middle eastern experts suddenly . 
  how the fuck do you know if he 's actually in danger or not ? 
  triggered much ? 
  sure , just like the poles were responsible for ww2 because they fired at those german troops . . 
   now , it was likely `` far right '' , but that is 100 % conjecture . 
  yet it 's yelled here . 
  lmao , this sub man . . 
   until it turned out a balkan gang threw it / r/europe , now with double the bigotry !, 
   there are about 100 cases on record , not `` hundreds '' . 
  ah , no biggie then / s, 
  there is no `` we as in europe '' . 
  i do n't have anything in common with edgy racist kiddos from denmark . 
  implying serbia was the cause for ~ ~ the ~ ~ ww1 ... 
  people say it 's unusual , but i do n't think it 's that unusual . 
  it 's well documented in political history that discontent is on the rise when the economy starts growing again but people do n't feel the change in their pockets . 
  they are n't extreme left . 
  from what i know they are associated with an extreme history of sorts ( troubles , etc ) but their social and economic policies are not extreme at all . 
  all i see is a bunch of rich fucks laughing at the public health system . 
  if i was a poor person in britain i 'd be pissed off , english tradition or not . 
  i generally enjoy the banter in the british parliament but cameron has turned it into an eton students union dick waving contest . 
  yeah , looks like this thread attracted all the tory immigrants from / r/unitedkingdom , lol . 
   his advisors are not particularly savoury either , you 've got someone who is an ira apologist , you 've got the hamas supporting , the criminal ( arsonist ) and if that unsavoury enough you have a wife beater for the economist . 
  and the tories have their king saud supporters , their cocaine lovers and their pig fuckers , among many others . 
  as for apologism , the conservatives supported the fucking apartheid until the bitter end , but that fact seems to go forgotten by the venerable british media . 
  you make it sound like labour are the only party ridden with scandals and controversy , they are n't even no1 , really . 
  so corbyn `` hates '' britain ? 
  that 's the new line ? 
   in my opinion sanders has much more credibility . 
  he comes across as more a pragmatist . 
  that 's because in the us the system is set up in a way that radical change is nigh impossible . 
  jewish left simply means that , historically , there have been jews participating in leftist politics , either in israel or abroad . 
  the article you 're looking for is probably this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jewish_bolshevism the first sentence :  jewish bolshevism , also known as judeo-bolshevism , is an antisemitic canard notice the top-right corner :  part of a series on antisemitism, 
   which they wo n't because morality . 
  or , you know , we just ** do n't want to ** ? 
  what is it with reddit and lack of empathy ? 
  george soros a marxist ? 
  alright , this thread has reached new levels of stupidity lmao . 
   was n't left created by jews ? 
  on wikipedia everytime you go back in time to the first left movments it is more than half jews that organised things . 
  not sure if this belongs to / r/topmindsofreddit or / r/internethitlers, 
   as a moderate top kek . 
  what a load of bollocks . 
  is it a coincidence that all these articles about the imaginary antisemitism of the left have started appearing during the last years , when the major european right/far-right parties such as front national have shifted from antisemitism to anti-islamism ? 
  it 's sad and disrespectful to jewish history , imo , that the israeli right and a minority of jewish intellectuals have been teaming up with conservatives in the us and the far-right in europe . 
   well germany 's 1979 entry in the eurovision contest was called dschinghis khan there 's been a greek cover of this song and it 's great , 
  maybe they should n't have started 2 world wars . 
  yes . 
  glorious secular / r/europe now uses the word of random orthodox priests to justify its racism . 
  came here just to check the thread titles hoping that the sub may have gotten better but nope , still stormfront shit . 
  immigrants and refugees are an easier target than the catholic church . 
  glad we agree that people can in fact be offended . 
  jesus , i do n't have anything against poland . 
  it 's just the `` je suis whatever '' and `` muh !, 
  100 % freedom of expression '' rhetoric that i find ridiculous . 
  and to be clear , even if wearing communist symbols was a-ok , i still would n't do it . 
  because i am not a jerk and i am sensitive to polish people being offended by it . 
  i do n't like `` offending for the lolz '' . 
  i was talking about the ` muh free speech ! ', 
  reactions in this thread . 
  the top comment compares this to charlie hebdo ffs . 
  so exactly what happened with the `` rape of europe '' cover . 
  why the cries about censorship then ? 
  from another comment of / u/yeezysaves :  bilal hadfi , m al-mahmod , ahmad al-mohammad , brahim abdeslam , chakib akrouh , abdelhamid abaaoud , samy amimour , omar ismail mostefai , foued mohamed-aggad . 
   the `` french '' & `` belgian '' nationals . 
  i will never understand racists who pretend to like black rappers . 
  cognitive dissonance much ? 
  seriously , i want to know if freedom of expression would apply to me wearing a `` hammer and sickle '' t-shirt in the centre of warsaw . 
  would the police protect me and my right to free speech ? 
  good thing they did n't depict them with hooked noses . 
  i wonder , if this were catholic priests groping children in the magazine 's cover , would it be allowed to come out ? 
  or is ` the freedom to offend ' just a vehicle to sugarcoat the modern versions of * der st\u00fcrmer * ? 
  europe was a princess from lebanon , according to ancient greek mythology . 
  just saying . 
  no problem my friend . 
  you know `` germans '' means both men and women , right ? 
  english nouns are ungendered . 
  but sure , if you think `` gay jokes '' are funny or original go ahead . 
  east germans were said to have the best sex though . 
  plus , the gender imbalance started happening after 1989 . 
  egypt is under a secular-ish military dictatorship right now . 
  supported by the us and the eu , no less . 
  if it makes you happy , there were some german neonazis in greece yesterday , hoping to meet their `` comrades '' from the golden dawn party . 
  let 's just say they ended up meeting the doctors and nurses of the greek healthcare system instead , 
  immigration of that scale * is * a bad thing , because it means lots of people have lost their homes , jobs , way of life , etc.
