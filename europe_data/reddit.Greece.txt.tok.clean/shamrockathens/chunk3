  who gives a shit ? 
  well , i am not an expert in belgian and dutch politics , but the whole flemish/walloon language situation that has lead to language/regional political parties and inability to form a normal government looks equally hilarious to me . 
  it 's the new racist myth of reddit : `` we ca n't accept more refugees because they are young males who wo n't get laid ^ ^ [ citation ^ ^ needed ] and will start raping our blonde women '' . 
  conservative means protecting the status quo . 
  a christian europe * is n't * the status quo any more though . 
  calling him a [ reactionary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reactionary ) would be more correct . 
  says poland , with 0 % immigration . 
  and usa , with lower population density on the planet and the majority of immigration being skilled . 
  yeah , you guys are * totally * not racists ^ ^ / s, 
   super extra virgin . 
  seems like the consumer will be the first to `` touch '' it . 
  this is starting to sound kinda creepy . . 
   there are archived signed orders commanding extermination of all polish people on the territory of ussr , and we know how they were carried out . 
  you existing is proof enough that in fact they * were n't * carried out , if they existed in the first place . 
  but hey , if you hate the ussr and your country 's socialist past so much why do n't you voluntarily abandon all the disputed german/polish lands the red army conquered ? 
  no we are not . 
  yesterday was stalingrad day so you had to go out and create 30 threads shitting on russia and ussr . 
   someone claims that the killing of jews was somehow worse than the crimes of stalin well i am sorry to break it to you , but that 's the consensus western view on 20th century history , not the russian or greek one . 
  even the eu commission clearly said they did n't believe these can be equated . 
  and it 's not due to lack of knowledge on the crimes of stalin . 
   not only jews ( he killed them too ) . 
  but i thought bolshevism was a jewish conspiracy , why were they persecuting themselves ? 
  claiming `` they had the same plans '' and `` did the same things '' is just false . 
  like factually , historically untrue . 
  if the ussr had their * generalplan west * regarding poles and baltics , well , they had 45 years to implement it and they did n't . 
  however horrific the katyn killings were , it was n't `` the same '' with auschwitz and treblinka . 
  you do n't need to rewrite european history to point out stalin 's crimes . 
  it was n't just the left , there are many mainstream political parties in western and southern europe that feel disturbed by eastern governments ' repeated attempts to force the `` nazism and communism are the same '' ideology down their throats . 
  if it was just the left it would 've passed . 
  also , why is the `` european '' in european left in quotes ? 
  nazism was collectivistic , til . 
  if you are saying they did `` the same things '' you are seriously trivialising the holocaust and the systematic extermination of slavs , your people included . 
  the auschwitz survivors that got liberated by the red army certainly would n't agree with you . 
  i 'd say you are doing your country 's history a great disservice with comments like that but oh well , what do i know . 
  eastern europeans with an agenda like yourself have become the ideological commissars of / r/europe and everyone who does n't agree is a `` russian shill '' or a `` commie pinko '' and should be driven out . 
  shut up you pinko commie red !, 
  i do n't know what / u/stuarts _ fs 's post history is , but the vast majority of those from east europe bitching about ussr every day are the same who bitch about immigrants . 
  hypothetical immigrants of course , because estonia and poland have 0 % non-euro immigration exactly because of their soviet past . 
   most german soldiers actually paid or asked for food/drink/etc . 
  they were mostly polite . 
  no shit , your country was allied with hitler . 
  it 's impressive how you are constantly trying to portray yourselves as the real victims of ww2 in these threads . 
  maybe , just maybe , if you did n't try to destroy stalingrad and genocide slavs alongside the nazis , the russians would n't show such vindictive and criminal behaviour when they fought back . 
  stalingrad was the bloodiest single battle in the fucking history of mankind , did you expect to be treated with roses after you lost it ? 
  no but you can only theorise until it 's proven to be a fact . 
  i mean in italy 60s through 90s there were so many scandals and conspiracies uncovered that would be considered prime tinfoil-hat material today . 
  freemasons , the cia , nato , communists , fascists , the mafia , the political system , it was all there . 
  hehehe . 
  but seriously , if anything the czechs deserved it more than both of us . 
  lol he is n't self-centered , it 's a fact that 90 % of moderate russian users has been driven out of / r/europe . 
  and he is totally right that reddit tries to play progressive when it comes to russia/isis/whatever when in fact it has become a hub for all kinds of reactionary bullshit such as mra and anti-immigration . 
   a right-wing yale historian with an axe to grind against left-wing politics who is n't even very well accepted in the wider historical scholarly circles on some opinions due to his political bias . 
  heh , could that be [ stathis kalyvas ] ( http://politicalscience.yale.edu/people/stathis-n-kalyvas ) ? 
  he is a joke of a historian . 
   the plans for having a communist uk . 
  what ? 
  the reason stalin 's purges started ( maybe as a pretense , but still ) were his disagreements with trotsky , the primary among them being socialism in one country vs world revolution . 
  stalin was a cruel pragmatist , he never planned to establish soviet rule in britain . 
  the `` russians coming with skis through alaska '' myth was convenient for 1950s us but there was never such a plan . 
  nothing makes sense in the above comment , that 's the point , 
  georgia says hello . 
  the opposite of what happens with mykonos/malia/kavos with drunken tourists . 
  `` what do you mean it 's in greece ? '', 
  ehh , we are kinda famous and unique , for good or bad reasons . 
  before the crisis everyone would start reciting homer or say something about football , euro 2004 and all that . 
  now they are probably showing sympathy or bad mouthing us behind our backs . 
  on the other hand noone is going to guess we are greek tourists if you do n't tell them as much . 
  it 's always `` are you from spain/italy ? '' . 
   they 'll say something like `` oh , you 're croatian ?!, 
  i have a serbian friend , his/her name is _______ '' lmao , that 's totally true in all levels ( suburb you live , etc ) . 
  for fuck 's sake , we are 30,000 people living here , stop assuming i should know everyone . 
  they * were * occupied for a brief period of time by greece , britain and france . 
  under the treaty of sevres , turkey/ottoman empire was supposed to be a protectorate . 
  \u266b * iron like a lion in zion * \u266b, 
  tbf from the looks of it greece-italy-france-spain have fucked every other mediterranean country in the ass . 
  that the marxist terrorist organisation [ 17n ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolutionary_organization_17_november ) was actually controlled by [ pasok ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/panhellenic_socialist_movement ) / the communist party/the secret service/the americans . 
  today , that syriza is actually an instrument of the americans/the russians/the germans . 
  a conspiracy theory does n't necessarily have to be false . 
  in athens too . 
  the communist party was a major force in france and italy . 
  also , the labour party in the uk ( which btw beat churchill shortly after the war anyway ) was quite pro-ussr and a lot more leftist than it is today . 
  clearly , you should stop applying videogame logic to world politics . 
  do n't worry , common sense is n't popular in these threads . 
  people like him believe politics are some kind of videogame . 
  press the button to drop the bomb , no problem . 
  they do n't understand churchill would n't last a day in office after a decision like this . 
   they shoud ' v started dropping those on ussr 's cities until they agree to pull back to 1939 borders . 
  lmao , this shit getting upvoted shows how much the eastern european nationalist circlejerk has taken over / r/europe . 
   waning global influence russia and china went from backwater semi-feudal state and punchbag colony , respectively , to major industrial world powers under socialism . 
  itt : baltic users saying `` fuck you corbyn '' and british right-wingers claiming to be worried about labour 's future under corbyn , when it 's clear that labour is going to pasok-level obscurity under the blairites . 
  ah , i see we 've already started the psychanalysis of corbyn here in / r/europe . 
  just like tsipras was a * firebrand ideologue * and clearly a * deluded lunatic * who 'd never compromise , amirite ? 
  it 's the same with all countries that have a large diaspora overseas , mainly in the us and australia . 
  the irish thing is well-known because of saint patrick 's day . 
  these communities try to pronounce their ethnicity and culture in order to stand out from the others * and that can look really funny to the people living in the homeland . 
  at least the irish have assimilated more than the italians and the greeks . . * to be fair , historically the reason they stuck together so much was n't to stand out but for self-protection . 
  the us was a wild place when those people got there . 
  interesting combination of username-flair , heh . 
   the congress of vienna trying to fix europe in the same way the european council now does that comparison does n't do the european council any favours . . 
   i went in a holiday in greece this summer , and i did n't get a receipe for anything in athens you 're getting receipts ~ ~ literally ~ ~ almost everywhere and it has been this way a few years now .
