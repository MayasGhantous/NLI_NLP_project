  and i do n't agree with banning symbols or ideologies , by the way . 
  if someone is dumb enough to carry around the swastika and '' '' `` traditional '' '' '' runic symbols the joke is on them . 
  from wikipedia :  latvian left-facing swastika or thunder cross dates back to bronze age . 
  it is widely seen scratched on the surfaces like rocks , weapons and pottery as a protector sign . 
  so the same way you find it scratched in ancient rocks everywhere in the world . 
  which means it 's not a national symbol . 
  a court is n't where political arguments are settled . 
  can i sue pasok for not really being socialist ? 
   and swastika is latvian ethnographic symbol fairly often used in folk art with no political connotation , them defending it means far less than it would in other countries where it is used exclusively as nazi symbo not this argument again . . 
  the swastika is ** not ** a latvian/german/greek / roman/other _ ancient_european_culture ethnic symbol . 
  it 's not even a pagan religious symbol . 
  it was a decoration . 
  if you are n't a jainist , hinduist or budhist you are n't allowed to use that excuse , sorry . 
  that 's because they only use these symbols as a wink-wink for nazi nostalgics . 
  it 's the same with golden dawn here . 
  `` i am only using the swastika because it was used in ancient greek art . 
  do n't you dare say it has * anything * to do with the nazis ! '' . 
  yep , totally buying that / s, 
  did you even read the wikipedia article you linked to ? 
   all for latvia !, 
  was a ** nationalist ** [ 1 ] and ** far-right ** political party in latvia  after a ban on symbols similar to the nazi swastika or the soviet hammer and sickle in 2003 , members of the organization protested outside latvian parliament with ethnographic symbols bearing reversed versions of the swastika associated with the nazi regime . 
  all for latvia !, 
  leader dzintars raivis defended the protest , arguing that `` the swastika is by no means something hitler thought of . 
  basically a map of mountains for southern europe . 
  lmao . 
  the nerve of some people . . 
  clearly they should stay in syria and die so that eastern europe stays mulsim-free . 
   john chrysostom , archbishop of constantinople he was syrian , heh . 
  did n't know her , interesting .

  these photos do n't do the anti-muslim crowd any favours , let 's just leave it at that . . 
  compared to where , exactly ? 
  obviously you do n't see that kind of nationalism and bigotry expressed at american sports , but i remember a story about steve kerr ( his father was killed by an islamic group in lebanon ) where the opposing college 's fans were chanting `` plo , plo '' to taunt him . 
  a rational response , at last !, 
  i agree any european muslim going to fight in syria has no business returning to europe , at least not without an interrogation of some kind . 
  why do n't they focus on fixing their faulty system of handling cases of radicalised muslims instead of blaming the refugees ? 
  is it so difficult to cross-check immigrants and refugees against a european database of people with known associations with terrorist groups ? 
  why do n't they work with syria ( assad regime ) , lebanon , turkey , etc on this ? 
  i mean ffs , half of the perpetrators of the last two attacks were people known to the authorities . 
  surely we can do something about this before starting to do background checks on syrian refugees travelling across europe with their families ? 
  exhibit a :  we said a lot of them are terrorists , which this evidences . 
   all paris attackers identified so far are european nationals , according to top eu official exhibit b :  can you not read ? 
   it 's unfortunate that people like you get to vote . 
  yeah . . 
  i say let 's wait when there is proof that even one of the perpetrators was a syrian citizen . 
  i agree , it 's sexist to assume they were all males . 
  are ordinary romanians responsible for antonescu and causescu ? 
  the salt is real . 
  they felt * so * vindicated , waving their dicks around and demanding apologies by everyone who is pro-refugee . 
  then it looks like multiculturalism works in eastern europe . 
  that 's because they do n't have any muslims , lol . 
  why is it ` terrifying ' ? 
  it 's sad and it might make you feel uncomfortable , but you ca n't make reality disappear just because it makes you feel bad . 
  that 's the standard version of history in the west . . 
  no doubt there are horribly bigoted passages in the qu ` ran . 
  but i dislike this post-9 / 11 trend of westerners ` studying ' the qu ` ran and trying to find justifications for modern islamism in there . 
  the old testament is just as horrible , but no serious scholar should look to it to find answers about israel 's current foreign policy . 
  no , what he claims is that these people do n't even read the qu ` ran . 
  they read wahhabist manifestos and terrorist manuals that attempt to ` explain ' and ` modernise ' jihad for the modern world . 
  these people are much more influenced by [ qutb ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sayyid_qutb ) than they are by muhammad . 
  i am not sure this is worse than all the calls for deportation of 2nd and 3rd generation muslim immigrants who are french or belgian citizens . 
  i mean , dismantling the ghetto and allowing for more mixed neighbourhoods is n't a bad idea , but it 's funny that these calls are coming from the racists now . 
  if i remember correctly , this guy was sold twice to al nusra by the so-called moderate factions of the syrian opposition . 
  these are the people the us and france have been allied with in the syrian civil war . . 
  this is the elephant in the room . 
  today the g20 met in turkey and were involved in serious discussions about isis , when the main problem ( as a kurd user wrote in / r/syriancivilwar ) is that turkey refuses to close its border to isis . 
  this is the main factor keeping isis functioning as a state . 
  so we have a nato member having open borders with the islamic state . 
  how absurd is that ? 
  typical case of how a reddit circlejerk is constructed out of thin air . 
  first , someone mentions that their social media contacts are `` blaming the victims '' ( ? ), 
  and `` post anti-western stuff '' . 
  then , a ` murican with an axe to grind decides , for no apparent reason , that they were * specifically * maoists . 
  not socialists , not liberals , not dreaded sjws , they were * maoists * . 
  after that obviously the usual suspects are triggered and start valiantly swinging their swords against the imaginary foes they themselves created . 
  i feel sorry for the innocent french victims , hell i could easily be among the crowd attending the rock concert if i was living in paris . 
  but i ca n't help but feel grateful that greece has stayed away from the mess in the middle east and has maintained good relations with the arab people . 
  even though the extremist islamist madmen are unpredictable , noone here is afraid that a blind attack could happen in athens . 
  same with germany , even though many criticise merkel 's immigration policy , it certainly helps improve germany 's image among the muslim world . 
  let 's hope it stays that way . 
  it 's even worse than that . 
  the us , uk and france were so anti-assad at the beginning of the syrian civil war , before isis became the international boogeyman , that they more or less fought alongside al nusra front ( = syrian branch of al qaeda ) against the regime . 
  one of the charlie hebdo brothers was actually interrogated by the french authorities at that phase but was let go . 
  and let 's not forget that if it was n't for the british parliament 's rejection the uk would have engaged in bombing against assad , so de facto helping the rebels of all factions . 
  these are the inconvenient facts that most analysts and journalists tend to forget . 
  i would n't give a shit about trump if it were n't for people coming into / r/europe and claiming anyone who laughs at him is an idiot . 
  trump is shit and his opinions are shit . 
  occupy a swath of land in syria and relocated refugees there ? 
  genius !, 
  obvious trolling is obvious . 
   `` what they should do is get all the countries together , including the gulf states , which have nothing but money . 
  they should all get together and they should take a big swath of land in syria , '' trump said . 
  `` they should do a safe zone for people where they could live . 
  and then ultimately go back to their country , go back to where they came from . ''  the billionaire real estate developer and entertainer also reiterated the u.s. should limit the number of the refugees allowed into the u.s. `` 10,000 , i 'm not thrilled , but maybe . 
  200,000 people ? '' he asked . 
   `` this could make the trojan horse look like peanuts if these people turned out to be a lot of isis , '' trump declared . 
  these sound to me like the ramblings of a mad man , sorry if i have n't caught up with the current zeitgeist of this sub . 
  far-right ` muricans coming here and claiming anyone who disagrees with trump is an idiot .
