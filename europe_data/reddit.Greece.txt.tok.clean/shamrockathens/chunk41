  no  latvians ? 
  no  slovenians ? 
  yes  bulgarians ? 
  yes  ( fyro ) macedonians ? 
  yes, 
  then in the first half of the 20th century it 's chaos again !, 
  there are netherlands-born players playing in the euro ? 
  damn , misery needs company = /, 
  sure , adi . 
  ha did n't know that , til, 
  the soviets voluntarily left your country . 
  remind me how the nazis left austria , 
  that sounds eerily similar to the excuses some ussr nostalgists use for the holodomor , you know . 
  you are right . 
  and i say that as a greek person with the name of alexander . 
   the death of 10s of millions on their hands billions !, 
   regimes just kilometres away had all the freedom in the world not even the most deluded ` murican or eu federalist would make such a claim . 
  i see you 're conveniently forgetting the expulsion of jews from spain . 
   over the entire world huh ? 
  beating the old woman was a dick move but maybe she should n't have been walking around like she is the imperial ambassador in a colonial country . 
  or baltica , like the beer !, 
  `` please mr. farage , we are good , white people , not like these fucking gypsies '' . 
  they want to be [ house negroes ] ( https://www.google.gr/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=5&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahukewjnvdjhpyfnahvmbsakhrzxcwmqtwiimtae&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3fv%3dznqe9nukzvq&amp;usg=afqjcngjju1i1vwd0ktsid_0iiv1hjcp0w&amp;sig2=r_jlay_g6dhchftidwffkg ) basically . 
  kinda similar to how some 2nd generation albanians joined golden dawn to beat up pakistanis . 
  it 's sad , actually . 
   those coming from cultures with repressed sexuality and medieval gender views so kinda like redditors, 
   if certain groups have a much higher propensity to commit sexual assault why should you allow them to settle in your country ? 
  i was n't aware there were so many us middle class frat boys willing to emigrate to europe . 
  as a greek i find it amusing when people from countries such as the us or ireland claim there are n't any syrian refugees . 
  it 's obvious they do n't have a clue yet they keep on posting their bullshit copypastas they picked up from some internet shithole . 
  lmao please tell me you 're joking, 
  they 'd probably consider you a filthy wog . 
  if you go searching for friends in these political parties i pity you . 
  rule of thumb : if a person is shitty and racist towards one group of people , he is more likely to be shitty and racist towards other groups as well . 
  have n't you fucked off to voat yet ? 
   i think the germans were right in saying that the craziest plans came from jews ( morgenthau and kaufman were both jews ) . 
  well the nazis certainly knew how to recognise a crazy plan , they had mastered the art . 
  lol you probably have n't heard of the morgenthau plan then, 
  the same exact argument could be used for muslim countries like saudi arabia , just change the word ` orthodox ' with ` muslim ' or ` sunni ' . 
  bill gates ' house and a whole peninsula of greek land , exaaaactly the same . 
  these monks are allowed to do their murky business in this ` private property ' only because the greek state allows them to . 
  what are they going to do if the greek state seizes the church 's assets ? 
  sue it in the european court of human rights ? 
  some people here believe they are living in pre-1789 europe . . 
   but there is a year imprisonment if you try to sneak in as a woman  and who is going to enforce any sort of punishment on mount athos ? 
  there are n't any female monks . 
  did n't you read the fucking article ? 
  are you really from israel ? 
  how could you be so naive to believe these shady dudes are your friends ? 
  most of them were openly antisemitic until the early 00s then switched to anti-muslim rhetoric to get more votes . 
  they are more to the right than the mainstream far-right parties in europe since they are practically gders . 
  the article title tried to reflect this , albeit in an awkward manner . 
  what exactly is it that you do n't understand ? 
  probably because the / pol / memes are more convenient for them than mentioning that this is golden dawn 's sister party , i.e. 
  or they can just call them what they are : neonazis . 
  well i do n't remember all the far-right saviours of europe protesting the invasions . 
  it was the damn commies who did that too . 
  not to mention some eastern european countries now vehemently opposed to taking in any refugees gladly participated in said invasions . . 
  lol . 
  still living in 2013 i see . 
  funny how the `` we must listen to what the people want ! '', 
  argument is only used about far-right voters though . 
  the complete absence of any mention of the huge strikes and demonstrations in france is pretty telling . 
  defending saddam ? 
  looks like you mistake corbyn for ronald reagan . 
  anyone who supports trump does n't need smearing . 
  the `` secret schools '' is a myth though . 
  maybe that 's because germany actually paid for their past mistakes and learned from them . 
  unlike your country that got it easy because the soviets wanted to show good will to the west . 
   this did not lead to the mass settlement of one group in another group 's homeland . 
  what ? 
  a big part of the neolithic populations were middle eastern and mediterranean in origin , even in places like ireland or sweden . 
  [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pre-modern_human_migration] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pre-modern_human_migration ) [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neolithic_europe] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neolithic_europe ) contrary to the racial myths of the 19th and 20th centuries , civilisation in the ancient times moved from south to north and from east to west . 
  and even closer to our times , have you heard of the [ migration period ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/migration_period ) ? 
  mass resettlements of populations have been happening all the time in human history . 
   that is thick coming from the descendants of hellenic greek national city states . 
  ancient greece did n't have nation states , it had city states . 
   nation states are older than empires . 
  what ? 
  there were no nation states at the time of the persian , macedonian or roman empires . 
  people did n't think in those terms back then . 
   and races are older than species . 
  so the human races ( if such thing exists anyway ) are older than the human species ? 
  so should the scientists stop researching because their results are too `` pc '' for you ? 
  sorry that the historical evidence contradicts your 19th century ideologies about nation states and races . 
  i am not sure you understand what 's the london transport board . . 
  damn muslims , after stealing our jobs they want to steal our racism as well !, 
  yeah , it 's mostly anti-islam jerking and `` deus vult '' memes . 
  i mean , the french were butchering their colonies until 50 years ago . . 
  in switzerland itself women did n't vote until 1971 . . muh medieval culture !, 
  good questions and i do n't think there are definitive answers , but here are some guesses :  the north coast of aegean sea that 's the macedonian and thracian regions , which may not have been inhabited by greek tribes at the time the events of the iliad took place . 
   the north-west that 's epirus , and the reason is probably the same as above . 
  of course , it may be the case that homer just did n't know about those places . 
  also , bear in mind that there were numerous tribes back then that did n't leave much written history behind them ( illyrians , thracians , dacians , etc ) and they were all leaving in those areas around greece . 
   the central mainland greece central mainland greece is full of mountains , it 's never been densely populated . 
  yeah , the thread title is bullshit . 
  izmir was and is more greek than istanbul , whatever that may mean . 
  i mean , it 's doubtful whether constantinople was greek even before the ottoman conquest , it was the capital of a multinational empire that called itself roman and the only greek element was the language used . 
  no matter what nationalists say , there was no greek national identity in 1453 . 
  berlusconism .
