  the white nationalist viking wankfest is hilarious and sad . 
  the vikings were n't what you think they were . 
  you mean the [ rus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rus%27_khaganate ) ? 
  that 's not ` viking ' unless we use the term extremely liberally . . 
  look , this guy murdered 6 innocent people , but let 's not forget who 's the real monster here : / u/norrisobe / s, 
  i agree , both need to be dealt with . 
  you 're defending a terrorist who murdered innocent people , you 're the one who 's clearly insane . 
  you need help . 
  bissonette , dylan roof , that psycho from sweden . . looks like a pattern to me . 
  if you consider homophobia such a big problem ( which it is ) , why do n't you start by convincing your orthodox christian compatriots , who no doubt are far more numerous than the muslims in serbia ? 
  i 'm not picking on you or your country btw , i 'd say exactly the same if a greek was arguing that muslims pose a threat to lgbt rights here . 
  that 's how it started but it 's not why it became a world war . 
  the germans and the other major powers had been preparing for a war ( schlieffen plan , etc ) for imperialistic reasons . 
  westerners say that all the time , who knows , maybe one day they 'll believe it themselves , 
  black metal used to be pretty big during the 90s and early 00s . 
  you still see the occasional weirdo with a burzum shirt in public, 
  do you consider cyprus to be in europe ? 
  the dutch treated ethnic germans similarly . 
  and the czechs started doing it even before the communist government took power . 
  there are some ( quite disturbing ) videos and photographs from prague after its liberation that show how much hate the czechs felt towards germans at the time . 
  blaming it on the soviets is dishonest . 
  what alesia ?!, 
  '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_history_of_italy_during_world_war_ii ), 
  you tried it . . 
  they know they 're not getting out alive . 
  especially in this case , it 's convenient for the turkish anti-terror units to just kill him , for obvious reasons . 
  how is this `` jakubmarian '' data always so faulty ? 
  eurostat is garbage if it 's indeed their data . 
  in greece the percentage is ** a lot higher ** than 2 % . 
  a second foreign language after english is obligatory and even though most kids still choose french , german should be at least 20 % . 
  these maps are shit . 
  ancient greeks looked mediterranean not `` nordic '', 
   this is having a token black guy in every other scene because of reasons . 
  where does the black celtic blacksmith come from ? 
  like having a token northwestern european in films about the ancient mediterranean world ? 
  oh wait , in these films * every one * is played by british or wasp american actors, 
   the opposite representation ( light skin egyptians and so on ) always trigger reactions except it has n't ? 
  did you see reactions against `` 300 '' , `` troy '' or alexander '' ? 
  and it is n't new , this has been happening in every movie or tv show set in ancient greece , rome , egypt , palestine since 1950 . 
  ancient greeks and romans did n't look like brad pitt and gerard butler , jesus was certainly not blonde and blue-eyed . 
  so yeah , * it is * culture stealing and historical forgery . 
  if you have a problem with bbc 's videos you should have with traditional hollywood as well . 
  thanks !, 
  personally i 'd love to live in the netherlands just for the cycling but yeah if you are n't used to it it can get dangerous, 
  thank you very much !, 
  i 'll pass on the information and send you a pm if she has any questions . 
  greeks are found everywhere indeed , lol . 
  cheers !, 
  do the ny times report sexual harassment incidents perpetrated by ethnic germans ? 
  ha , my sister is going there to study next month . 
  any advice ? 
   ottoman imperialism was motivated religiously . 
  lol that 's your brain on videogames , people, 
  lol , you 're romanian . 
  you 're a living proof this never happened , otherwise you 'd be muslim now . 
  is he against bosnians and albanians moving to czechia ? 
  yeah , he `` pissed them off '' by taking a selfie with a serbian girl , which * she * asked for , and who the serbian attackers did n't even know personally, 
  lol @ the downvotes . 
  turns out the serbian instigator of the fight made a racist remark about henderson to the serbian girl , who he did n't even know . 
  frankly , i hope they include the racist motivation and throw the book at them * and * to the bar owner and any greek employee that got involved . 
  fuck them . 
  that 's the same argument erdogan uses against the `` gulenist terrorists '', 
  why would you want to warm up a snake in the first place ? 
  west indies ? 
  just racist , privileged shitheads pretending they 're ` rational intellectuals ' with some stormfront-level arguments . 
  human nature my ass . 
  his/her ancestors had rape and pillage as a source of economic development , maybe we should discriminate against dorky danes because human nature does n't change , you know ? 
  the hypocrisy is astounding . 
  they pretend like they do n't understand that these people just want to live their life in the best way for them and their families and allude to some greater `` plan '' to genocide the white christian population . 
  i 'm sure these are the same people who lament the germans getting kicked out of their colonies in east prussia or whatever . 
  they sure as hell were n't wanted there !, 
   citizens are basically doing the thing that governments have been doing for 10,000 years , keeping foreigners out . 
  your knowledge of history is shit mate, 
  this thread was always going to shit , this is / r/europe  if you grew up in a country where people are not accustomed to adhering to legally binding contracts then i do n't want you as a tenant that 's like the definition of racism . 
  `` i do n't like their * culture * , you know what i mean ? 
  nudge nudge wink wink '' . 
  imagine if germans were n't taught about racism fron an early age . . 
  those happened in the 20th century , not at the time of the `` muslim conquest '' , they happened in anatolia and not southern europe and were more about turkish nationalism than islam . 
  especially insulting since most isis victims are muslims themselves . 
  why the fuck would an indonesian , nigerian or filipino muslim feel the need to apologise to christians about islamic terrorism ? 
  i wonder how many of those who chastised the muslims on this thread have participated in * any * demo in their lives, 
  you basically answered this yourself . . why would a turk or a kurd or an indonesian or a nigerian muslim feel the need to protest against islamic terrorism perpetrated by isis and al-qaeda ? 
  he does n't feel they 're part of his community and in most cases these terrorist attacks are against muslims . 
  it 's like asking greek orthodox christians to participate in a demo against protestant/catholic violence in n. ireland . 
  sure , they could grab some land in siberia in 1941-42 but they 'd get their asses kicked eventually . 
   i do n't think you can label muslim conquests into north africa , ** southern europe ** , persia and india as anything other than genocide . 
  wtf are you talking about , there was no `` muslim genocide '' in southern europe . 
  the only countries that converted were bosnia and albania and there 's hardly any turkish dna found in any of the balkan countries which means their populations were largely left untouched . 
  this paragraph could easily be from an onion article . 
  pure comedy !, 
  so when are the eastern european countries going to apologise for their treatment of the refugee crisis ? 
  i 'll be waiting . . 
   the initial suspicion would be the debilitating after-effects of the debt crisis , although the earliest gii report i could find was from 2009 , putting greece more or less at the same level compared to the balkans and to the rest of europe . 
  hundreds of thousands of young greeks have emigrated to richer countries in the last decade , many of them university graduates . 
  our education system is strong but there 're no jobs here . 
  also , businesses do n't take many risks . 
  well , makes sense , most of our potential innovators have emigrated to richer countries . 
  if it 's some weak-ass children 's explosive sent by an obscure left-wing group -  terrorism if it 's neonazi skinheads terrorising refugees and throwing molotovs into camps -  not terrorism, 
   the only rightwing terrorist attack in the eu during 2016 was committed in the netherlands , yes . 
  this is incredible , i 'm not sure if the report 's methodology or the countries ' anti-terror laws are to blame .
