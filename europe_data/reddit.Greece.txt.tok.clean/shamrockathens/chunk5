  because they do n't open their shops on sundays , duh . 
   the germans and the finnish still agreed to give money for free to a nations of people who does not pay taxes , spinster daughters of public administrators get a special pension , people retire at 50 and fake jobs are invented as reward for clientelism . 
  so you 're basically proposing torture ? 
  nice . . 
   the greeks seems to have forgotten , but the people who picked up the bill did n't . 
  you obviously do n't know what you 're talking about ( big surprise , i know ) . 
  the greek pension funds got ravaged by the psi , as did thousands of greek small-time bond holders . 
  m o r a l h a z a r d, 
  dude , are you aware we are in the same position as italy ? 
  and this , ladies and gentlemen , is what happens when a thread gets to the front page . 
  also wiretapping our politicians - before it was cool . 
   everyone hates greece who is somehow still part of europe . 
  what are they going to do , cut the land along our borders to remove us from the european continent ? 
  what / u/squiksquik said . 
  this ` joke ' has been beaten to death , freedom of expression has been exercised , those who were supposed to be offended were offended . 
  i guess they are also tired of far-right clowns like geert wilders hijacking their cause . 
  hey guys . 
  what 's your opinion on euro 2004 ? 
  do you think you did a good job hosting the event ? 
  we would blame france too if she were n't so irrelevant . 
  i just looked up the wikipedia page , and in fact you had more victims than i remembered from earlier research . 
  so yeah , definitely not a cakewalk , sorry if that sounded insulting . 
  i edited my previous post . 
  i know present day germans hate their nazi past . 
  i wanted to stress why some people find it hard to forgive . 
  there are people still alive today who had their relatives killed in mass executions and burnings of villages . 
  my grandpa barely escaped a blockade that would 've sent him to a forced labour camp in germany . 
  i could * understand * those people if the present situation brought them bad memories . 
  it 's easy to forgive when the german occupation was ~ ~ a cakewalk ~ ~ relatively easy for the ethnic dutch , compared to other countries . 
  the soviet union did n't care to establish a people 's republic in greece . 
  the red army could easily take greece if they wanted but stopped at the bulgarian border . 
  the greek communist party could participate in the post-war democratic process in the same way their italian and french counterparts did , but the brits and the greek far-right monarchists did n't even want that . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/30/athens-1944-britains-dirty-secret ) is a recent article from the guardian on these events . 
   phoenicians started out as greek colonists phoenicians were ... phoenicians , they were n't greeks . 
  we even took our alphabet from them - alpha and beta are semitic words . 
  majority of those who arrive on the greek islands are from syria , that 's what i wrote . 
  you 're right , i forgot about them . 
  yeah , look at that propaganda war against spain and italy !, 
  not in the aegean islands . 
   carthage was ethnic roman/latin before the islamic invasions what ?!, 
  ** edit : ** to clarify , do you mean the period of roman carthage ? 
  do you have any source that the original phoenician ( punic ) population was displaced and carthage was resettled by romans ? 
   [ berbers ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/algeria_women%27s_national_volleyball_team_at_the_2012_summer_olympics_%287913969288%29.jpg ) in algeria and tunisia can look similar to other ethnic european groups such as greeks , and there is a legacy of ethnic greeks and other ethnic europeans living in the area for thousands of years . 
  greeks do n't look like that . 
  i know the image of ` wogs ' in australia and nz is prevalent , but you got to try harder man  media portrayal is a bitch : before frank sinatra most americans did n't know italians could have blue eyes . 
  even the irish , who are among the palest people in europe , were n't considered white and were typically portrayed with ape-like features in british cartoons . 
  also , historically , greece had very little connection to carthage and the berbers . 
  dna connection is pretty much zero . 
   we do n't really know where they 're coming from , as many of them do n't have any passports or anything . 
  except we * know * the vast majority of them are syrians . 
  if these are accurate , it shows that the propaganda war against greece was in full mode * way * before syriza won the elections . 
  do you mean historically ? 
  that has to be because of britain 's support for the greek monarchy , general meddling in greek affairs , the bombing of athens in 1944 and because of cyprus . 
  personally , i find these ` surveys ' to be complete bullshit . 
  what does it even mean to ` like ' another country ? 
  i may have a negative opinion of the current british government , churchill or colonialism , but i like british people and culture . 
  not even 10 % of the wider public know or understand his achievements in linguistics . 
  i only know very little even though i 've studied theoretical cs . 
  he is omnipresent because clearly a lot of people are interested in his opinion on political matters . 
  compare him for example to watson ( of dna fame ) , who has tried to express his political views but noone cares about it , even though his academic achievements are more prestigious than chomsky 's . 
   krugman was banging for the oxi vote in that referendum when he should have realized how much of a bad idea it was to begin with , and he should have said so . 
  except that 's not what krugman wrote . 
  that 's pretty much it . 
  btw , the last few days there has been a mccarthyist campaign against varoufakis and the left platform of syriza in the corrupt oligarch press . 
  which tsipras either orchestrates ( through leaks ) or at least encourages . 
  truly disgusting stuff for a supposedly left-wing party . 
  anti-stalinists my ass . 
   even though einstein 's idea of doing science did n't include blog rants . 
  [ well , about that ... ] ( http://monthlyreview.org/2009/05/01/why-socialism/ ), 
  latvians hate him !, 
   remember croatian linguistic slavic purism in place of many serbian loanwords from greek and latin , as well as english so , if i understand correctly , it was croatia that initially had more pan-yugoslav nationalist views rather than serbia ? 
  that 's interesting . . 
  i do n't know , will they be less than the `` leftists put her there to force merkel in a bad spot '' comments from the previous thread ? 
  do n't believe the polls . 
  polls ! = vote . 
  this poll looks heavily cooked - which is the norm for greek polling companies . 
  looks like slavic-baltic brotherhood to me ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  if you stay out of the euro you wo n't have to find out , hopefully , 
  unless you were planning to go literally to southern lakonia , do n't worry . 
  greece is pretty big , 
   the west bank stopped being a center of conflict some 30-40 + years ago , and is a completely safe and decent place to live in since the oslo accords . 
  [ arguably before that ] [ are you even serious ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_intifada ) jenin , nablus and ramallah are all in the west bank . 
  not being the living hell that is gaza does n't mean the west bank is a normal place to live in . 
   considering her young age if she were from the west bank she would just grow up in a normal arab neighborhood . 
  so now we 're talking specifically about the girl ? 
   people from the west bank for one have no trauma or whatever to deal with . 
  i see we 've gone from cynical insensitivity to ridiculous false claims in this sub . 
   indeed , ordoliberal economist hans-werner sinn of the university of munich argues in his 2014 book the euro trap : on bursting bubbles , budgets , and beliefs that the `` european central bank has become too accommodating and that its plans to buy sovereign debt are illegal '' . 
  additionally , he argues that the eurozone bailouts during the eurozone crisis have `` created moral hazard , allowing feckless mediterranean countries to get away with minimal reforms and only limited fiscal discipline '' . 
  sounds like your typical present german politican . 
  is this supposed to be a real argument against the left ? 
  lol . 
  to be fair , the byzantines had executed [ a little anti-catholic pogrom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacre_of_the_latins ) some years before the 4th crusade . 
  well , a lot of young people have left , but you have to understand it 's more difficult than in most other eu countries . 
  we are kinda alone here , we do n't have major european capitals 2 train hours away , so you can only realistically visit your family 3-4 times a year . 
  we do n't have a ` brother nation ' we can easily hop to , apart from cyprus ( which also has economic problems ) . 
  we do n't have english as our mother tongue and strong communities abroad , like the irish . 
  but yeah , that 's what he 's going to do if shit hits the fan . 
  there is no generous ` social system ' here .
