  that would definitely make his acceptance to skyrocket . 
  they will be able to vote in embassies and consulates , no ? 
  yeah how dare they ... unite ? 
  if you take switzerland for example you will notice that although it has a terrible geography , it is surrounded with very rich and productive areas which makes the infrastructure to improve the communication was really worth it . 
  on the other hand the areas far in the south have a terrible geography and their only option is to connect with areas that are already far away from the center of the continent . 
  this sounds exactly why old block of flats in athens look like crap . 
  i guess these regions are just more far away from the core and combined with a troublesome geography that makes infrastructure rather expensive in some cases , this could translate to great challenges . 
  actually sch\u00e4uble was the first to raise questions regarding the handling of the refugee crisis . 
  it 's not right that he did n't say anything . 
  he was skeptic right from the beginning . 
  [ they do their best ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:afghanistan_opium_poppy_cultivation_1994-2007b.png ) ... to increase it, 
   i do n't see why you think all these people will suddenly flood into france . 
  i do n't mean that many of them will flood france but surely many of them will flood greece, 
  i hope france also plans to take serious measures to help the countless immigrants of this war, 
  i have read [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/127a9i/how_similar_is_the_greek_golden_dawn_party_to_the/ ) some really good opinions regarding what will happen if golden dawn comes to power, 
  here is a good reason for greeks to hate you : http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/529932.stm, 
  right , by adopting the same wages with bulgaria , our economy will become as good as theirs, 
  so you propose us to vote for the parties that get lists that contain bank acounts in switzerland and do nothing with them ? 
  ( when germany , france and spain got several milions with the same list ), 
  no they ca n't share the same hero as long every balkan nation has its own ` great idea ' ( the ambition to expand ), 
   it has also split local residents , some saying the money could have been spent more wisely on the construction of new apartment buildings , factories or roads , and others claiming the project is a matter of national pride . 
  wow , sounds really familiar , like um . . athens 2004 ( i do not imply that athens got even uglier than it was ) but sounds like a great waste of money . 
  judging from what happened in athens and generaly the monstrous coruption in the balkans i bet that the constructor is probably a good firend of the goverment or something like that gaining shitloads of money , the goverment reassures its re-election in the future and the people becomes poorer . 
  it is also worht noting that for two years the official state was searching to find which department of the state had the original list . 
  after they realized that it was lost , venizelos the ex minister of fiance said that he had a copy and sent it to the prosecutor for economic crimes . 
  most people now believe that venizelos and other ministers of fiance just hid the list and the journalist was prosecuted because he revealed this secret, 
  disregarding what the ruling was , do you think it is logical ? 
  or you just agree with the ruling jsut because rt disagrees ? 
  [ people like jimmy wales , the wikipedia cofounder have a different opinion ] ( http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/06/extraditing-students-for-copyright-claims-jimmy-wales-says-its-wrong/ ), 
  i wonder why you are getting downvoted . 
  that was exactly what i thought as well, 
  it 's still better compared to giving the nobel peace prize to barack obama just beacause he is n't george bush, 
  it wo n't happen . 
  they just prohibited any protests or public gathering that may happen tomorow in athens . 
  from here : http://www.zougla.gr/greece/article/dimero-diadiloseon-enopsi-tis-afiksis-merkel, 
  you do n't know what you are talking about, 
  there is one i really liked : `` you confess in facebook that you murdered an immigrant and nothing happens . 
  you satirize a priest and you go straight to jail '', 
  according to the [ official press release of the police ] ( http://www.astynomia.gr/index.php?option=ozo_content&amp;lang=%27..%27&amp;perform=view&amp;id=20338&amp;itemid=965&amp;lang= ) he was `` arrested flagrante delicto '' accused for `` malicious blasphemy and revile against the religions '' after many users around the world reported his account of facebook to the unit against the cyber crime, 
  the question is if the goverment wants such data ( especialy for the mps ), 
  i live in greece and i have seen exactly this in utlra natioanlists and fascists, 
   if you run out of money , then you run out of money keep in mind that even when money is scarce there are people who will do everything to steal the money and they will be protected by the politicians . 
  this is why people protest : www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/znauf/greece_is_riddled_with_corruption_but_a_study/, 
  of course cause most people may believe that the current situation is caused by a few old people who receive the pensions of deceased relatives, 
  feel free to host them, 
  but when the number or jobs is decreasing , making firing easier only worsens the problem, 
  may i assume that france also offers to take care of all the immigrants that will be forced to flee from their homes ? 
  exactly . 
  the point should n't be to just cut expenses to reduce the deficit but fix all the structural problems that cause the uncontrollable spending . 
  greece has already lost 30 % of its gdp the last years and the goverment still plans to reduce wages/pensions in public sector . 
  for example it would be really great and effective if there were a pan-european mechanism for dealing with corruption that has monstrous size in greece and other crisis-hit countries . 
  i really wonder what is going to happen if the crisis hits germany . 
  will they join the anti-austerity countries or they will just start blaming everyone ? 
  it 's funny that the article is about immigrants and racism and your answer is full of hate, 
   yeah , how dare they wish for a better life ? 
  it 's fucked up how entitled these immigrants are !, 
  do you volunteer to offer them a better life in your country ? 
  another point that i forgot to mention is that they even claim the macedonian part of greece . 
  and i 'm not talking about what one or two extremists believe . 
  i 'm talking about what they learn at their schools, 
   so are bulgaria , albania , serbia , kosovo that bothered about the naming issue or is it just greece with a problem ? 
  bulgarians share the same opinions with greeks about this issue as parts of macedonia belong to bulgarians as well, 
  i understand that they live in the region called macedonia . 
  i also understand that they want to be called macedonians ( but i believe that this is not right ) . 
  but i do n't understand why they build statues all around skopje with themes from ancient macedonia . 
  he is claming that they ca n't have all the rights on a region that is shared by three countries . 
   they hate the bulgarians and think they 're better than them orly ? 
  that 's new to me  they hate the turks for stealing their ancient territories its more correct to say that the last centrury greek people were forced to leave places where greek people lived for many centuries : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/population_exchange_between_greece_and_turkey  and hate the americans probably cause that 's what 's popular nowadays we also hate them for backing a military junta in greece something that bill clinton admitted in 1999 : http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/529932.stm, 
  not to mention that the photo is several months old, 
  it feels like i just read an article about greece, 
  it indeed is n't really reliable but it seems they just show the results as measured for avgi ( the newspaper that is run by syriza ) . 
  i doubt that these measurements are unreliable, 
  lets hope it wo n't end up like this : http://www.zerohedge.com/news/eur-soars-most-october-2011-greek-announcement-here-what-happened-after, 
  really interesting infographic . 
  could you also describe the positions of each party ? 
  ( i 'm especially interested to understand what this democrats '66 means ), 
  by far the greatest part of the letter :  they ( the greek politicians ) are so aggressively stupid that they still believe there will be a ` later ' for them to dominate, 
  did you read the next paragraph ? 
   that same construct is falling apart unstoppably , and the repercussions of its demise will prove a toxic solvent for the whole european project . 
  under these circumstances , `` a loose interpretation of the rulebook with the assistance of some creative macro-accounting '' will simply not do, 
  the question is are there any other routes except more integration ? 
  the part of the debt that belonged to the private sector was haircuted and converted to the english law which means it is impossible to default on it again, 
  why are you repeating the propaganda ? 
  from what i know most hardcore corrupted pasok supporters , supported new democracy this time, 
  and golden dawn a dinosaur that was just reborn ... 
  those have already been saved by the psi . 
  greece now owes mostly to the ecb and other european states edit : and the imf, 
  independent greeks and democratic left are more likely to form a coalition with the coalition of the radical left . 
  as for new democracy it may be supported by the panhellenic socialist movement and democratic left, 
  results from skai.gr : syriza 31-25 nd 30 -- 25 pasok 15 -- 11 independent greeks 9-6 democratic left 9-6 communist party of greece 7 -4 golden dawn 7 -4 also note that these are not results from exit polls, 
   unsealed and counted this . 
  however selected electoral centers will transmit the results via special cell phones so in about 2 hours ( 9pm gmt +2 ) we will know the results with 0,5 % accuracy, 
   the notion that greece can avoid reforms and avoid the responsibility for its debt is pretty unrealistic neither syriza nor new democracy say that reforms are avoidable, 
  this article ins n't different from articles like this : http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-06-14/central-banks-warn-greek-led-euro-stress-threatens-world beware !, 
  the evil greeks are about to destroy the world !, 
   your country needs a functioning state at last . 
  thus , it is governed ordered , we recommend the new democracy so they are suggesting us to vote one of the two parties that brought the state in this condition . 
  this makes it even worse cause from what i understand there are two posibilities . 
  they expect that either new democracy is tranformed in a magical way starting colecting taxes from the rich people who never pay taxes and somehow make the public servants they employed to work efficiently . 
  or they expect that new democracy will just execute orders from the lenders on how to run the state,
