at the time i was in school not much was taught about the northern tribes apart that they were bloodthirsty barbarians and alexander whooped their asses . 
  then albanians are noted again during the war of independence , as used by the turks for their cannon fodder . 
  then you pretty much fade into irrelevancy again , with a footnote about your independence , then a side note about hoxha in modern history . 
  it 's [ this image ] ( http://imgur.com/s3vh8in ) which has been posted in reddit a few months ago .

  they have an air force ?!, 
  in a local one perhaps , but not anywhere else . 
  and under the table of course as the legal age to start working is 15 . 
  kids can work below that age provided it 's `` light '' work only . 
  btw that is n't red tape , it 's the [ european directive 94/33/ec on the protection of young people at work ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catid=706&amp;langid=en&amp;intpageid=209 ) . 
  i was targeting the `` more innovative companies '' to showcase that there are already companies innovating in the field , rather than the old fashioned method of hailing a cab . 
  and truth be told , knowing both our countries problem with the crippling unemployment , i still would n't want thousands of uber-like drivers unleashed in the streets competing in a price war with regular taxi drivers . 
  everyone would lose from it , with the exemption of uber . 
   `` what should be done about the youth being disillusioned with politics ? 
  pm samaras gives his perspective . '', 
  he still has a month left to give me my free wireless wi-fi internet . 
  there are two start ups in greece who implemented the same concept as uber , only they use licensed taxis instead of a random dude with a car . 
  you can ask for a taxi from their phone or web app , and you can choose from a variety of drivers and vehicles . 
  i only use this service to call a cab and i never had a problem with it . 
  the problem is that they seem reluctant to move to the european markets .

  [ i would n't mind some hot ottoman action . 
  great scenery , much sightseeing to do especially if you like religious artifacts . 
  getting in can be a problem though assuming that you are not an eastern orthodox . 
  you have to obtain a permit and only 10 non orthodox males can get one at a time .

  but seriously it 's impossible to start listing the beaches there , and i wanted to keep it to lakonia . 
  some general guidelines i posted about meteora a few months ago :  keep in mind that the monasteries in meteora have [ strict visiting hours ] ( http://www.kalampaka.com/en/meteora/monasteries.asp ) . 
  also you have to count in the time that will take you to ascend/descend . 
  i do n't think you can visit them all in a single day . 
  you should at least visit the holy monastery of great meteoron ( the biggest one ) . 
  as for the others : the holy monastery of varlaam is the second biggest , but i do n't think you should visit it unless great meteoron is closed , also the same applies for the holy monastery of st. stephen . 
  the monastery of the holy trinity is a small one and climbing it takes time ; however you are rewarded by the great view . 
  i personally liked the holy monastery of rousanou/st . 
  barbara , it is fairly easy to get to and because most tourists are concentrated on the larger monasteries above , it has a serene atmosphere . 
  note that females are required to wear non-provoking clothes ( deep necklines , shorts , tank tops , basically anything that exposes too much skin ) to enter the monasteries , usually they give you a long shirt to cover exposed legs , but it is better to plan ahead and wear proper attire . 
  start from [ kalamata ] ( https://www.google.gr/maps/@37.0471807,22.1305011,13z ) . 
  drive through the [ taygetos passage ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le3vsvnncia ) , see the [ chasm ] ( http://imgur.com/h8ljqbo ) in which the ancient spartans threw their prisoners . 
  if you like trekking taygetos is amazing . 
  before you reach sparta stop at the town of mystras and tour the [ mystras palace ] ( http://imgur.com/utqjt9n ) . 
  leave sparta and continue south , and you 'll reach the quaint little town of [ gytheio ] ( http://imgur.com/movluqw ) . 
  after gytheio continue towards the traditional and vibrant town of [ areopoli ] ( http://imgur.com/wea34ah ) . 
  visit the [ diros caves ] ( http://imgur.com/yrofxlz ) and take the 40 min boat tour through them . 
  drive on and wander through the fortified [ tower villages ] ( http://imgur.com/8bnut96 ) of mani . 
  at the end of the road you 'll reach [ cape tainaron ] ( http://imgur.com/kvhwlmz ) . 
  the remains of of the death oracle of poseidon are near . 
  backtrack to gytheio and continue to the medieval tower town of [ monemvasia ] ( http://imgur.com/wesna7l,jul9tes ) . 
  end the trip to the relaxing island [ elafonisos ] ( http://imgur.com/ikaa189 ) , with its [ great beaches ] ( http://imgur.com/a/wunjs ) . 
  i 'm not sure why you are talking about her , but she has her own subreddit / r/nessadevil ( nsfw ), 
  / r/eurogirls ( nsfw ), 
  so it 's a slow day and i started reading the reference she cites for the above quote ( mpaltsiotis l. , etal , the greek minority in albania ) . 
  he states that greece tried to inflate the number of greeks in albania , not because of territorial disputes ( even though greece had wanted to annex north epirus , that ended after ww2 ) but to exert pressure in albania for the rights of the greek minority because they were pretty crap during hoxha and berisa . 
  he also states that greece tried to establish a client relationship by offering a greek origin paper . 
  the term he used ( \u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u03b2\u03ac\u03c3\u03b7 ) basically means that the government does you a favour and in return you vote accordingly . 
  so the greek state offered greek papers to albanians so that they would in exchange vote for those who helped them , and specifically the greek party in albania . 
  that of course backfired spectacularly because those who left albania for greece had no intention of returning just to vote . 
  you could get greek papers by either money ( plain old corruption no surprise there ) , or by an oral test in the vlach language with a known speaker of that language , the so called `` vlachmeter '' . 
  they also used another retarded way of calculating the minority by giving greek status to anyone who was orthodox christian . 
  edit : to answer your first question `` is there any territorial claims on south albania '' , i would have to say that there are none . 
  also the law has changed since 2001 when this paper was written and albanians can legally work in greece with their albanian names . 
  `` currently occupied territory of yunanistan '', 
  the paper you linked just reaffirms what i said : stigmatized albanians seeking to avoid discrimination from the greek communities adopted greek names , greek language , and orthodox religion . 
  she also links to cases in italy , turkey , and australia where albanians try to hide their nationality , and are absorbed into the dominant culture . 
  also i found this phrase which describes that perfectly : ` ku \u00ebsht\u00eb shpata \u00ebsht\u00eb feja ' - ` where the sword is , there lies religion ' . 
  are you sure about the name changing ? 
  if i remember correctly you have to transliterate your name to greek characters in order to get official papers ( something like arthur becoming \u0386\u03c1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1 ) . 
  also in the past a lot of albanians used greek names and claimed that they are from north epirus , i 've even met a few guys saying they are north epirots and not albanians . 
  that was because there was a discrimination against albanians , so with this way they could claim a greek descend and avoid any discrimination . 
  also / r/balkanpolitics, 
  25th of march ( or 17 depending on who you ask ) the day we declared independence from the ottomans . 
  it 's a national holiday meaning everything is closed and usually there are school and military parades .

  look at [ this quote ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frank_miller_%28comics%29#personal_life ) . 
  which sides are you talking about ? 
  the 300 is no more real than batman or daredevil . 
  it was not very surprising considering that frank miller was behind it . 
  i mean look at sin city , or batman in the dark knight universe . 
  also he is the same same guy who produced [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holy_terror_%28graphic_novel%29 ) . 
  his comics are always gritty and dark and 300 is no different . 
  see the persian empire and the crime syndicates in sin city . 
  also see how he depicts the villains in his works : xerxes , two face , joker , the beast in the elektra universe etc. 
  in most of his works the bad guys are always monstrous , inhumane . 
  that said i would love if he could create stories based on the grimdark world of w40k . 
  300 is movie , which is based on a comic , which is based on a book , which is loosely based on historical events . 
  if you wanted to see historical accuracy you chose the wrong film . 
  there are also many picture subreddits . 
  no buffering once it loads !, 
  half of my house is in the `` no signal '' zone , and the other half is in the `` emergency calls only '' . 
  there are very specific spots where i must stand so i can even make a phone call , let alone connect to the internet . 
  connectivity wise i 'm fucked . 
  my maximum speed is 5 mbps .
