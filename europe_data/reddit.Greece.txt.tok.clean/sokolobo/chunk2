  i live in athens btw . 
  we have four of them . 
  greece stronk can into military badass-ness . 
  just a little nitpicking here : greek market for doctors is over-saturated . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/health_systems_by_country#greece ) wiki entry we have the largest number of doctors per population of any oecd country . 
  other sources [ 1 ] ( http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/health/physicians/per-1,000-people ) , [ 2 ] ( http://gamapserver.who.int/gho/interactive_charts/health_workforce/physiciansdensity_total/atlas.html ) , put us at 4.4 physicians per 1000 people ( 2001 census ) , while [ this ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sh.med.phys.zs?order=wbapi_data_value_2010%20wbapi_data_value&amp;sort=desc ) report raises the number to a staggering 6.2 . 
  this comes as a remnant of a past mentality , where the doctors profession was seen as solution to financial difficulties and also respect from the local community to the family which raised a doctor . 
  this forced many children of past generations to try with any means necessary to become doctors , either by studying their asses off , or migrating to other countries where acceptance to a medical school was easier ( mainly romania , hungary , bulgaria , serbia etc. 
  ) , and then coming back to try the certification exams . 
  meanwhile nursing was seen as an inferior profession , and as such greece is plagued by an awful shortage of nurses , with [ this ] ( http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/health_glance-2011-en/03/07/index.html;jsessionid=2b80lp8o6ttee.x-oecd-live-01?contenttype=&amp;itemid=%2fcontent%2fchapter%2fhealth_glance-2011-26-en&amp;mimetype=text%2fhtml&amp;containeritemid=%2fcontent%2fserial%2f19991312&amp;accessitemids=%2fcontent%2fbook%2fhealth_glance-2011-en ) report showing less than one nurse per physician , and 3.3 nurses per 1000 people in a 2009 census ( it is important to note that the number was 1 nurse per 1000 in 2000 ) . 
  overall brain drain from financially struggling countries is a bad thing , however there is simply no future for a lot of doctors in greece , so it is probably for the best to migrate .

  i like that someone put greece on sicily . 
  surprise recolonization !, 
  greek here . 
  while i was studying i knew albanians , serbians and turks ( and a few cypriot turks ) . 
  i think that between normal people ( not some super nationalistic idiots ) , turks and greeks can become really good friends , as our cultures are very similar . 
  also albanians i knew had a very nice behaviour , nothing like the albanian circlejerk we had going a while ago . 
  serbians looked a little more detached , and hanged out with their fellow countrymen . 
  the whole thing was probable caused by an off-comment made two years ago by an epidemiologist , when the minister of health was presented hiv/aids infection rates in a conference . 
  the data presented the amount of newly registered hiv infections and media blew it out of proportions by turning it into a percentage . 
  in numbers : injecting drug users ( idus ) registered cases were 10 ( 2,13 % ) in 2009 , 15 ( 2,83 % ) in 2010 , and 213 ( 26,04 % ) in 2011 . 
  the media played on the change between 2010 and 2011 and sensationalized every title with `` 1500 % increase in aids infections ! '', 
  ( i wo n't even mention the fact that they keep changing hiv with aids ) . 
  in 2012 the amount of idus registered with hiv were 506 ( 47,83 % ) , and in 2013 230 ( 29,04 % ) . 
  i guess they took the 2012 number and conjoined it with the comment that idus are deliberately injecting themselves with contaminated needles . 
  in reality the frequent hunts for drug users during those years , and the crippling of the budgets of the organizations responsible for the care of idus , made them unable to procure clean needles , and forced them to share . 
  but seriously why fuck it up with ketchup ? 
  if i 'm too bored to make a proper sauce i just burn the pasta with some butter , and put some grated cheese and pepper on it . 
  it 's still delicious . 
  yeah sorry about that , i was very interested in machine learning when i was studying , in particular with association with nlp and hci . 
  however i was disappointed by the lack of interest and the availability of jobs , so concentrated into something more `` mundane '' ( dbs ) . 
  the advances are amazing in this field , sometimes i wish i was born in a country like the us where i could devote myself to this . 
  please read the first link about the contribution of the shipping industry to the greek economy and society . 
  do n't keep repeating the same things over and over again . 
  also please read up on the tax rates . 
  by your logic we should have became something similar to the cayman islands . 
  tax rates were never the problem . 
  the problem was/is a very corrupt bureaucracy who required constant bribing . 
  i do n't believe you will find any greek ( except those who were getting paid of course ) who disagrees with a much needed purging of the corrupt officials . 
   what has happend ? 
  probably they were `` invested '' into favours . 
  see above . 
   you could have your industry and tax it at this time and age do you seriously believe that any company is going to invest in creating an industry and supply chains to greece ? 
  when you can easily pay a chinese slump factory and have everything produced at a fraction of a cost ? 
  i am not talking about existing industries like ikea as you said , but to create a new one . 
  do you believe that if we combat down corruption ikea will open a factory in greece ? 
  bmw ? 
  pirelli ? 
  anyone ? 
  infrastructure , industry and investments . 
  something greece does n't have . 
  many profitable companies have left , and those that stayed behind are driven into extinction . 
  case point : our very profitable textile industry . 
  here is another link : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_tax_rates things are n't as simple as you make them out to be . 
  it is pretty telling when a company decides to leave greece and move to another country with higher taxes . 
  oh btw here is another link about the taxation on the shipping industry : http://www.pwc.com/en_gx/gx/transportation-logistics/assets/choosing-profitable-course.pdf, 
  mining , oil and forest industry can not leave a country . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  you can not take a forest and move to another country to pay less taxes . 
  shipping is a global industry any company can within hours to jump ship and move somewhere more favourable . 
  and as i already said they already contribute 7 % of the gdp , plus many more contributions to the society . 
  alienating the shipping industry would be a suicide .

  i had a cretan gf who often slipped back to her dialect , and after a while i could almost understand what she was talking about . 
  when i hear cypriots speaking though , its like noise with a few recognizable words . 
  i also get the feeling that when you speak with a greek , the words are forced through your mouth , like you are thinking how to say something , then speak grudgingly . 
  it is disconcerting to say the least . 
  apart from all the stuff already mentioned : i ca n't understand half the time they talk . 
  they have weird names . 
  they used to take the first name of their father as surname ? 
  the same as the nordic - son , - dottir ? 
  i had a few buddies in eldyk ( greek army in cyprus ) and they told me that the women there were obsessed with their appearance . 
  they would put on excessive amounts of make up even for a short walk .
