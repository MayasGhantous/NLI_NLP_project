  i know a lot of cypriots who work here and i could n't tell them apart from other greeks . 
  cypriot pita with gyros !, 
  i do n't like haloumi though . 
  they are really conservative . 
  however those who live a few years abroad seem to overcame this . 
  even though i do n't pay attention to the `` greece + cyprus = one country '' talk , one image that has stuck in my brain is the cypriots waving greek flags , in the massive celebrations when we won the euro in 2004 . 
  that is assuming no new austerity measures are introduced . 
  else we will continue into the downward spiral . 
  even with the current optimistic predictions , we should expect to reach before-crisis employment levels no sooner than 2025 . 
  talk about a lost generation or two . 
  we have around 28 % unemployment right now . 
  there is no safety net for those people . 
  meanwhile the `` flexible '' work contracts are trending with people barely making enough to survive ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydesyrzpwk8 ) . 
  how will these people survive until , lets say , 2020 ? 
  where is the tzatziki and the tyrokafteri , aka the throat lubricants ? 
  also i enjoy more inviting friends over and firing up a glorious bbq . 
  that way you can have the perfect excuse for consuming vast amounts of beer . 
  `` but honey it 's hot out here '', 
  you mean the tutorial island ? 
  my theory is that they were under surveillance from when they were just a thug group . 
  we are n't going to get better sources now unfortunately , probably in the next days , we will know what really happened . 
  i heard on mega that they were monitored from way back . 
  i 've no idea if is true or not , we 'll probably find out in the next few days . 
  i heard in the news that incriminating evidence produced by unauthorized spying ( by the agency , not everyone ) is usually accepted in courts . 
  maybe there is a special law about criminal and terrorist organizations . 
  it 's both evil and good . 
  good because they can expose info on situations like this , evil because you wonder what else are they listening into without authorization , and if they are being manipulated to hide worse secrets . 
  apparently the greek intelligence agency has been monitoring their communications without court order . 
  i thought it is interesting , i did n't expect them spying on an elected party . 
  it 's almost if our rulers copy paste each other in their incompetency . 
  at least yours managed to impose a tax , ours would still promise a tax free income if the troika did n't twist their arm . 
   there 's fear that the taxed owners will take the measure to the court people are pissed here too , because they took tens of thousands of euros in loans a few years ago , by looking to make a profit in the long run based on the promises of the government , and now this tax is going to bankrupt most of the small and medium producers . 
  greece here : there is a charge of around 15 euros per mwh for renewable sources . 
  however it does n't cover the costs of producing the energy as it is too expensive . 
  we would eventually have to pay 23,5 euros per mwh in order to close the deficit in the budget allocated for renewable power . 
  why so much you could ask ? 
  get this : our amazing politicians in one yet display of brilliance , in order to spur the `` green growth '' frenzy that we had a few years ago , decided to offer fixed prices , and tax free income to anyone who produced clean energy , for 25 years . 
  they started working everyone up to a frenzy with favourable loans , encouraging the people to invest in photovoltaic panels . 
  now they are talking about imposing a tax on that income , but we would still have to pay for all the money lost with this crap , with increased energy bills . 
  i very much enjoy neda ( [ \u039d\u0395\u0394\u0391 ] ( http://www.nedabeer.gr/ ) ) beer which is made in a microbrewery in kalamata . 
  two alternative zombie/comedy/satire movies , which are my favourite greek productions : * [ the evil ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ike0yhu5hky ) , ( [ imdb ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0813129/ ) ) * [ evil in the time of heroes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh5q55154po ) , ( [ imdb ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1314242/ ) ), 
  if you believed what the pm said , i have a bridge to sell you . 
  to be fair kla ( aka uck ) is n't an organization you can proudly display on a t-shirt , unless you are an ultra nationalist .

  unfortunately all european basketball subreddits are dead , and the rest of them cater to nba . 
  the interbasket forums are highly active though , and are my go-to place for any information about european basketball . 
   mostly thanks to greek diplomacy [ `` in 10 years no one will remember this dispute '' ] ( http://imgur.com/4gfposo ), 
  greece here , speeds are heavily influenced by your distance to the dslam , so you have a small group of people who are satisfied with their connection , and then varying degrees of frustration and anger . 
  for the record : [ ote ] ( https://www.ote.gr/en/web/guest/service-listing?redir=1&amp;lastlayoutid=18&amp;p_l_id=44418&amp;p_v_l_s_g_id=0 ) 24/1 speed , at 36 euros actual speed , around 5/700kb it sucks . 
  you make a lot of misguided assumptions , and i 'm just going to leave it at that because it just sounds like a broken record now . 
  but things are not as black and white as you paint them . 
  i 'm sorry to say it , but there is a big cultural difference that you northerners will never be able to understand . 
  in all the assumptions you made you never realised that greeks first and foremost blame the corrupt political system and each other . 
  all the hate started with the anti-greek media attention from the rest of europe . 
  you never realised that the economy made a sharp turn from agricultural to services , skipping the middle steps . 
  that instead of building necessary infrastructure most loans and funds have been embezzled by few . 
  that direct tax is the major contributor to gdp and not just one tax . 
  that despite whatever you may hear most greeks actually have been paying their taxes and will never see a cent of the money you pay . 
  so spare me the typical lazy , incompetent , tax dodging , irresponsible greeks propaganda , because it really does n't affect me , and i have gotten quite bored with it . 
  and frankly i believe the last three messages to be meaningless . 
  ( oh yeah sorry i do n't actually know what taxes they were paying during the junta years ), 
  i doubt war was ever a possibility . 
  though if the trade embargo had continued for a few more years we would be seeing a different picture now . 
  * comedy relief, 
  we talk fast ? 
  i was under the impression that you guys talked fast and threw in a few made up words to confuse everyone else . 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmndvhejo78 bonus : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qh0dwhdvx60, 
  you are replying to subjects i have n't even mentioned . 
  is tax evasion widespread ? 
  it is . 
  were we able to cheat on income tax ? 
  no way , unless you were paid under the table , or were self employed . 
  i explained why greece has such a low tax to gdp ratio , and why even if we could magically eliminate evasion and raise the taxes up to the nordic level we still would n't be able to compete . 
  as for the history , greece has been in default nearly half the time since independence . 
  between the wars with turkey , the balkan wars , the civil wars , and the world wars , the monarchies and the military dictatorships , greek economy never really had any time to recover and develop , and was instead in a state of perpetual default . 
  the last default started in the great depression of 1932 and ended in 1964 by virtue of american aid packages from when the country was demolished in ww2 . 
  when the rest of europe was going through industrialization , greeks were more concerted in killing the foreign enemies , and each other . 
   low taxes most of us could n't dream of i did n't follow the rest of the thread , however this is n't true . 
  [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tax_rates_of_europe ) . 
  in addition to that income tax , there is also a 16 % tax applied at payroll every month for social security ( plus a few other recently implemented taxes which i ca n't remember now ) . 
  despite this greece has one of the lowest tax to gdp ratios in europe , and is relying on indirect taxes to supplement the gdp . 
  denmark and sweden are the the best `` performers '' in tax to gdp . 
  [ source for 2011 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/taxation/gen_info/economic_analysis/tax_structures/article_6047_en.htm ) . 
  however the large unemployment , along with the fact that many employed greeks receive minimum wage ( or less ) , our tax to gdp will never be as high as i.e. 
  sweden because the majority of the population will be at the lowest tax level . 
  this is why greece has turned to indirect taxes ( which are easier to cheat ) in order to supplement the gdp . 
  tl ; dr : we pay less taxes than you because we are paid less . 
  btw even with those tax levels , i bet an average dane or swede has way more disposable income than a greek . 
  they are a small , landlocked , fledging nation . 
  a large percentage of their population is albanians . 
  they need something to give their population a strong sense of nationality , so they will fight for their country . 
  if they did n't have this history their nation would have been quickly swallowed up by either albania or bulgaria or even greece . 
  however their ultra-nationalist propaganda is going to backfire on them . 
  i do n't know about the serbs , but the rest of their neighbours do n't like them very much . 
   somehow won the uefa cup once ( ? ), 
  it was the euro cup in 2004 .
