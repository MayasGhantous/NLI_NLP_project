  i forgot germanos which started out as a battery shop , but evolved as an all things mobile ( smartphones , tablets ) store with a few other electronics . 
  i think that after merging and taking the role of oteshops , they have become one of the biggest retailers in greece . 
  greece : supermarkets : * carrefour - marinopoulos * vasilopoulos * lidl * sklavenitis electronics/appliances : * plaisio * kotsovolos ( owned by dixons ) * media markt general retailer : * jumbo * praktiker fast food : * goodys * mcdonalds, 
  in greece this has been happening for a while with aepi ( something like riaa ) , which forces every store that has the ability to play music ( even a simple fm radio ) to pay royalties . 
   arms depots were raided by the general population , putting 100,000 's of ak47 's into their hands . 
  thanks for that guys , about half of them ended up in greece ( i have fired with a few ) . 
  / r/balkanpolitics, 
  in urban areas property ownership is usually clear . 
  in suburban areas it can become messy . 
  however in the mani area the article is using as an example , property ownership is chaotic and probably is an outlier . 
  borders are poorly defined ( e.g. 
  my property is from that big rock to this tree ) , and different families often have grazing rights , passing rights and access to wells . 
  this complex ownership comes from past , where water was scarce and farmable land was a treasure to be protected by the family who owned it . 
  it made sense for a family to trade grazing rights to another family in return for milk or meat , or give allied families access to their water . 
  krattr the same arguments were brought up before and no one listened . 
  everyone is caught in this stupid circlejerk started by pagkalos , which was merely a way to divide the population into a us vs them . 
  turn the private sector against the public , and keep people divided so even harsher measured be implemented . 
  any time someone tried to bring logic into this argument , they were swept by the overwhelming `` omg 1 million public servants , fire them all '' , and stories by the ineptitude of someone at some service that someone went some time ago . 
  these lay offs will not even make a dent in the budget , nor will the efficiency improve in any organization . 
  furthermore the `` old guard '' will keep their positions , continuing to not give a fuck about the work they do , and dreaming their vacations for when they retire . 
  what they really needed to do was to look at every organization at a case by case basis , push forward a plan to modernize the sector , eliminate the vast bureaucracy , and implement a kind of internal affairs division to keep the employees in check . 
  i get the upper left panel , but how are the other three broken up ? 
  what does the legend mean ? 
  also what is batman doing in the bottom panels ? 
  are they ? 
  if you have to pay someone let 's say 1000 $ and he offers you to reduce the price to 900 $ , in return of a receipt for 200 $ , what would you reply ? 
  what would the majority reply ? 
  i 'm using big numbers to make my point clearer , vat evasion still happens , hell i was offered a reduced price last week while buying a 90 $ suit . 
  also i was n't referring to income tax , but other taxes like the tobacco and the car tax which decreased in revenue . 
  how many times have we heard that the minfin executives are troubled by the lower than projected revenue of a tax ? 
   ~ 7 % decrease in income from vat - which means there 's at least a 7 % decrease in consumption in greece ... or more vat evasion . 
  a positive one is the decrease of the tobacco and alcohol tax income by 33 % , which means that now we smoke and drink less . 
  of course it is not seen as a good thing by the government since they are calling it a [ black hole ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=el&amp;sl=el&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.kathimerini.gr%2f4dcgi%2f_w_articles_kathremote_1_21%2f03%2f2013_489141 ) . 
  wages are slashed , unemployment is on a steady increase , people are flocking to receive food aid packages , a large number of the population is now below the poverty line ; yet our politicians keep expecting increased tax income , and are baffled when it is way below from what they expected . 
  also the habit of storing leftovers for the next day . 
  our food is easily stored in the fridge . 
  and usually i just feed the cat if there is little food left . 
  while i agree with what you say , i was talking about the privatization of public assets like eydap , opap and the like . 
  energa and the other power companies were a poor effort to open up a previously state run monopoly , that turned into a quick money grabbing scheme . 
   this should be studied on a case by case basis and from teams of economists that 's just common sense , but i think in reality they will be sold to whomever supplies the most `` oil '' , after they have been devalued to hell . 
  this video reminded me of dark angel . 
  tax evaders are trying harder , and even those that were not , are contemplating it . 
  meanwhile those who ca n't , get ass fucked . 
   we bought 2 german submarines are they floating correctly ? 
  if it 's an especially cold day i resort to drip brew ( green jacobs ) . 
  a lot of my countrymen also prefer [ frappe ] ( http://imgur.com/s3hd3gz ) and [ `` greek '' ] ( http://imgur.com/ycimtj9 ) coffee , but they do n't sit well with my stomach . 
  usually we do n't have a problem with what coffee we are drinking , as long as we take our time to enjoy it . 
  [ solar water heating ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/solar_water_heating ) is already widely used in greece . 
  it 's quite efficient too , you get free hot water for about 3/4 of a year . 
  solar power is another story though . 
  yes , but would n't the private company be happier if they could sell the 212 for a higher price ? 
  the government did n't block a trade , they just told the private company what they should leave out of a trade . 
  btw i was replying to this :  how is the german government even involved , apart from formal approval of weapons export ? 
   right , ` we ' forced you to buy our stuff although ` we ' knew about ` your ' situation . 
  makes total sense to sell goods to a person who can not afford these goods , just to create a situation where you have to give that person money and accept cut in debt so that that person might have chance to get rid of his debt . 
  i have three articles which i found after a quick google : [ one ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/mar/21/greece-austerity-measures-military-spending ) , [ two ] ( http://www.defensenews.com/article/20120305/defreg01/303050004/eu-lawmaker-france-germany-pressured-greece-avoid-defense-cuts ) , [ three ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/less-healthcare-but-greece-is-still-buying-guns-6257753.html ) . 
  the tl ; dr of those articles is that greece was pressured into maintaining its defence budget despite the massive reforms and budget cuts happening everywhere , because greece is one of the largest importers of german and french weapons . 
  the government should still have a say over what gets traded . 
  see the wiki article above , the 214 submarine lacks some classified technologies from the 212 submarine . 
  a government is n't going to give away their classified technologies until they develop something better . 
  the article says the extra fee will apply to tablets and phones . 
  still stupid but when you dish out 700 $ for a new iphone the extra 10 $ fee will barely bother you . 
  if it 's applied to other storage media however , it 's a sure way to crash the hdd market . 
   open a beer bottle with a bayonet ftfy, 
  while i do n't know about austria , in greece you can be deemed unfit for military service if you have permanent problems ( heart diseases , spine problems , deafness , blindness , disabilities ) , psychological problems ( behavioral disorders , anxiety attacks , maladaptive behavior , schizophrenia ) , and drug users . 
  if someone is overweight , he is generally deemed fit for service , but depending on the case he may not bear weapons , or participate in exercises . 
  usually military life for these people can be considered hell . 
  now if someone is so much overweight that his health is in danger , he is unfit for service . 
  obesity usually comes with a variety of other health and psychological problems , that fall into the above categories of those unfit for service . 
  you have to factor in more variables to determine whether a high tax is bad or not . 
  for example the cost of living vs the available income after taxes . 
  if you make 30k per year taxed at 60 % and i 'm making 10k taxed at 40 % , you are still much better off even with the higher tax . 
   is the lack and willingness of paying said taxes all of those reasons add up to that . 
  there are many households now that their only option is to evade or starve . 
  also for the last decade the majority of greeks firmly believed that all their tax money were being squandered away to useless projects , just to make corporations and politicians rich . 
  i 've actually heard the quote `` why should i pay the tax , so we can buy another sunken submarine ? '' . 
  even before the crisis people used to take the moral high ground to justify the tax evasion . 
  or as the saying goes `` i 'd rather buy peanuts and feed the pigeons , than pay that '' . 
  it is very difficult to turn such a society into tax payers . 
  i ranted a bit ; in the end i agree with you that high tax is n't a bad thing , however when dealing with such corruption and a deeply ingrained belief that tax evasion is good , cranking up the taxes is the wrong way to deal with it . 
  do you really want to compare the infrastructure , welfare , social security , and organization of those countries you mentioned with greece ? 
  if you are in a place where you would n't smoke , then you also should n't vape . 
  that 's the rule i 'm following anyway . 
  as someone who switched recently i 've started to despise the smell of cigarettes . 
  even the light ones which did n't bother me before , now make want to claw my nose off . 
  35 to 40c is normal during the summer in the south . 
  extreme heatwave would probably be above 45c . 
  in general it is a period of time where the daily temperatures exceed the average maximum temperatures by at least 5c . 
  for example in [ 2003 heatwave in france ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/canicule_europe_2003.jpg ) . 
  now i 'm curious . 
  what kind of pastry things are you talking about ? 
  sweet or salty ? 
  i could have replied with those ones but i 'm not satan . 
  google returns 1 hectare = 0.01 km ^ 2 so 16,377,742 km ^ 2 = 1,637,774,200 hectares . 
  the far eastern federal district has 6,215,900 km ^ 2 so 621,590,000 hectares . 
  the amount of shields you 'll get is n't worth it . 
  latest reports i 've seen were saying that mikel and coffee island are giving starbucks a run for their money . 
  which does n't surprise me in the slightest because every mikel i 've seen is filled to capacity .
