  looks like lybians are going to smell something burning today , sorry guys :( also if you wait a few hours you could see the fires through the [ eosdis worldview ] ( https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/ ) . 
  you can use premeditated or deliberate . 
  yeah i just had a look at the mapporn thread and there is some disagreement with the map . 
  [ the video in question ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjkqwscwoh8 ), 
  these places are suburban though and far removed from the usual protest spots . 
  i pass through that area daily and ca n't ever remember a protest happening . 
  the map is simply incorrect . 
  there is no way in hell starbucks is more popular than everest and grigoris . 
  just look the amount of stores each brand has . 
  also starbucks is facing some stiff competition from mikel . 
   tsipras has to listen to justin bieber for 46 hours while on heavy drugs . 
  that 's too easy . 
  remove the drugs to maximize the torture . 
  yes you are correct . 
  it 's more expensive to keep remote islands supplied so by reducing the vat they can provide goods with the same prices as the mainland . 
  it 's official tomorrow the government will validate the pms decision for a referendum the following sunday . 
  the referendum will ask if the people want to accept the latest proposal of the institutions . 
  edit : tsipras will ask draghi tomorrow for a few days extension to the program so that the banks wo n't face liquidity problems . 
  edit : according to the news merkel was surprised by this decision , but agreed to it if the question is euro or not . 
  also the referendum will be validated as urgent national matter , because referendums for fiscal matters are prohibited by the constitution . 
  gemista straight out from the fridge . 
  and the venetians . 
  you 've never driven in greece . 
  left lanes are occupied by those who think are going fast enough or those who have expensive cars and think they are entitled to the lane , middle lanes are for the slow drivers and the peasants , right lanes are passing lanes or if there are trucks and buses on the road the emergency lane becomes the passing lane . 
  [ gyros is love , gyros is life . 
  i can live without air but not without gyros . 
  mortgage not any more , there was a 30.000 cap for debts between private entities ( such as banks ) , but it was abolished in 2010 i think . 
  there was a 5.000 cap for debts to the public , but it was recently raised to 50.000 and started excluding any debts to the welfare funds . 
  this is the incident that happened in 1996 : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imia/kardak, 
  yes it 's a never ending cycle . 
  both countries would have to agree to lower their defense budgets or it would be pointless . 
  we almost went to war in the nineties ( while both being in nato ) before the americans came and put an end to it . 
  and so the great souvlaki vs kalamaki , and tyropita vs mpougatsa-tyri debates would be ended . 
  whenever you say na !, 
  my hands instinctively try to move to a double-moutza position and it 's very confusing . 
  erm your line is similar to mine . 
  the only difference is that i pay for the cheaper 8mbps line instead of the 24mbps . 
  maybe you meant to reply to the guy above me ? 
  you can also add a few drops of chilly sauce if you want it more spicy . 
  also if you want another experience try the mayo , ketchup , cognac , salt , white pepper combination . 
  fries belong only in chicken gyros and chicken-bacon pita . 
  i always found tzatziki with fries a dreadful combination . 
  2 parts mayo , 1\u00a01/2 parts ketchup and 1 part mustard . 
  i thought we had already solved that problem with the goody 's pink sauce . 
  ew we get florida ? 
  look at mr fast speed internet over here . 
  i have an 8mb line and the best i get is 5mb and a healthy dose of disconnects . 
  or as the ote technician put it `` your copper network is so messed up , your only hope at better internet is if somebody bombed the area and we had to lay new cables '' . 
  actually a few years ago they called me to proudly announce that they had doubled my internet speed from 4 to 8 for free . 
  i told them if they were kidding me since i was n't seeing any difference in speeds . 
  then they tried to sell me an otetv package lol . 
  it wo n't be a tax decrease since the price of food and the utility bills will increase . 
  those are now taxed at 13 % vat , and if it is raised at 18 % it will really hurt low income households . 
  [ greece ] ( https://youtu.be/flr2yp9vixc ) rough translation : somewhere in some country it is now raining but i do n't care because here it is always sunny . 
  why not ? 
  just rename it to kostantiniyye , or the original name byzantium , and we shall create the new ere . 
  or to keep it correct the new eastern roman confederation ( erc ) . 
  no mate , we are not high enough level to deal with your fauna . 
  he probably means athens , it is after all the largest albanian city . 
  also please do n't feed the troll , just observe it in its natural habitat . 
  [ here you go ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nrefv2r.png ) , by the user / u/dman9797 , [ x-posted ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/1xfs94/the_world_divided_into_regions_with_a_gdp_of_1/ ) from / r/mapporn . 
  the world divided into areas of a gdp 1 trillion dollars . 
  does n't matter , after med . 
  union annexes the area it will be called new roman empire . 
  my apartment has more people than sealand . 
  can i get i5 by smoking pot ? 
  not enough mcdonalds , mobility scooters , and deep fried butter would be my guess . 
  personally i would like a european nba complete with drafting and all that . 
  it would allow us to create and retain talent and boost our teams to an even better and more competitive environment . 
  they are butthurt because powerhouse teams are ignoring the newly created champions league by fiba and continue to compete in euroleage and eurocup which are owned by eca . 
  damn dude you are lucky , kapesovo is a very picturesque little village . 
  the stony streets , the traditional style buildings and the stunning mountain views makes a killer combination . 
  unfortunately i did n't get much time seeing the place because i wasted too much time in mpeloi , and had to rush back out of the mountain while i could still see the trail . 
  walked through the streets a little then ate sweets at sterna . 
  i probably have some recent pictures of the village , i 'll update if i find them . 
  but seriously i would consider booking a room there when i visit zagori again . 
  i have yet to see our implementation of the tpd , but for the time being you can still buy stuff from local e-cig shops or order online . 
  albania is more famous for its organically acquired mercedes . 
  jk jk here is joke : there is a greek , a french and an albanian in a plane . 
  suddenly the french says `` we are now flying over paris '' . 
  `` how do you know ? '', 
  ask the other two . 
  `` i just put my hand out and touched the eiffel tower '' . 
  some time later the greek says `` we are now flying over athens '' . 
  `` how do you know ? '', 
  ask the other two . 
  `` i put my hand out and touched the parthenon '' he replies . 
  a little bit later the albanian says `` now we are flying over tirana '' `` how do you know ? '', 
  `` i put my hand out , and someone stole my watch '', 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/epirus_%28ancient_state%29 you should n't really confuse modern disputes and nationalities with entities that existed 2500 years ago . 
  not the same alexander . 
  the one that proved his greek origin was the alexander i around 150 years before the time of alexander iii ( the great ) . 
  also demosthenes was the one bashing the macedonians , and that is also the origin of the word philippic to mean a damning speech . 
  no , if you are referring to the insulting gesture known as mountza or faskelo , this is n't the correct way to do it . 
  you need to move the palm towards a person , as if you are throwing something , and all the fingers need to be extended . 
  see this documentary showing the correct form and variations of the technique : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0vpc99_t-c, 
  according to the 2011 census there are 480000 albanians living in greece . 
  it has been estimated that as much as 650000 legal and illegal albanian immigrants have lived here . 
  we use the bear one too .
