she 's against gay marriage too . 
   some students flag burning has n't happened since the referendum week where it was the eu flag being burnt , not the german and in absolutely no way the french . 
  there might be an ill feeling towards the german * government * around but that comes up only in periods of political uncertainty and turmoil . 
  france has been an ally since ... i think always . 
  honestly there are greeks who blame france ? 
  first time hearing this . 
  and i know quite a few people here . 
  the practical brit in action . 
  please do, 
  just do n't fucking let it pass . 
  the majority of young americans are against him . 
  and full of confusion and anger . 
  for once , do n't let it pass please . 
  stand up your ground and do n't give it up . 
  laughed more actually, 
  no idea how to deal with this so i 'm just laughing hysterically for the past 2 hours . 
  any better ideas ? 
  november 15th , 2016, 
  greek here . 
  since the early 70 's ( i think ) it 's mandatory to learn english at school , but most if not all students take private lessons too . 
  mostly all young people speak english and as for the previous generation i 'd say more than half of them speak it fluently or can hold a conversation . 
  generally you can get around easily throughout the whole country if you speak basic english . 
  many people ( ~ 30-35 % ) speak a 2nd foreign language , with french being traditionally the most popular and german taking the lead during the last 5 years , also some speak italian , and spanish has recently become quite popular too . 
  muslim greeks in ( western ) thrace speak turkish along with greek . 
  i 've also met elderly people who have some basic knowledge of italian and german since the occupation period in ww2 . 
  spot on , but there are as many opinions on terrorism elimination as there are ass holes , the band is no exception . 
  he does n't seem like the thinker type anyway . 
  that was utterly moronic and there 's no doubt about it . 
  but going to a concert does n't mean respecting the musicians ' views on life or politics or anything else - you just go there to enjoy the music . 
  as fas as i know he does n't * promote * gun possession through his music and eodm are not a political-oriented band anyway . 
  if they were to have a concert in bataclan again people would just go there to dance - as it should 've been a year ago . 
  on their interview for vice jesse hughes said [ the exact opposite ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n74hbrrfnic ) edit : about 19:10, 
  that 's awesome although , ok sting is great and all but if it was the eodm to have the first concert there , that would be so great . 
  \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 means provocative , there 's some kind of logic behind this translation :p, 
  i actually did n't know that until some months ago and damn , it 's food for thought . 
  but to be honest in greece the fighting did n't officially stop until 1949 . 
  ok , i 'm triggered . 
  question : do you see any litter on the street in this video ? 
  because i fucking do n't . 
  what did you expect him to do , one man all by himself , grap a piece of cloth and some chlorine and start scrabbing the street ? 
  there is a service in the municipality of athens with people using water tracks to clean the streets , usually late at night . 
  not to mention that you 're forcing a huge generalisation with absolutely no evidence . 
  try harder next time . 
  allow me to disagree . 
  the mistake you 're doing here is that you 're trying to form a general rule for a matter that depends on the circumstances . 
  and you also assumed that the russian students implied the ukrainians were speaking ' a dialect of russian '' , which i never said happened . 
  surely , it is easier for a ukrainian to talk casually with a russian from a town near the border than with a russian from yakutia . 
  this is exactly why i said there is a [ continuum ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/language_continuum ) . 
  having said that , the students of both countries were * actually chatting * , which means that , indeed , they could understand each other . 
  so , in this case we have a high degree of mutual intelligibility . 
  but only in this case . 
  taking for granted that this degree applies to any encounter between russians and ukrainians is as incorrect as it is to say that russian and ukrainian are two totally different languages . 
  and as always the truth lies somewhere in between ( and it is circumstancial ) . 
  that it why the graphic you attached here is not to be taken seriously - because , apart from the fact that the sources are not mentioned , it is an approximation beautified in order for complex linguistical concepts to be roughly ` accessible ' . 
  it was not my intention to get all political and i would like to avoid it . 
  i just shared a story i had once found funny . 
  i meant it concerning the degree of intelligibility , not the distinction of the two languages . 
  linguistically speaking , there is a much higher degree of intelligibility between ukrainian and russian than there is between norwegian and swedish or dutch and german . 
  moreover , the distinction between the three east slavic languages ( russian , belorussian and ukrainian ) is recent enough not to take that degree of understandment lightly . 
  although i learned all this long after the erasmus students were here . 
  there is a continuum between russian and ukrainian so i have no reason not to believe them , since i do n't know what part of russia they were from . 
  not much unfortunately . 
  they have a really cool coat of arms . 
  there are many greeks in odessa even to this day . 
  i had a classmate in primary school who was ukrainian and he had just come to greece but he learned the language relatively fast ( and that 's something to admire ) but he could n't pronounce the \u03b8 / th / sound and instead of athina he was saying afina . 
  or instead of theos ( god ) he was saying feos - and he wrote that way too . 
  funny thing is his name was ostap whose greek form is * eustathios * , with a \u03b8 , and pretty much he could n't spell his own name . 
  :p another thing i remember , some years ago we had a group of ukrainian and a group of russian erasmus students in the university of athens , i remember the russians saying `` we understand the ukrainians almost perfectly but they keep claiming they speak a different language '' . 
  i had found that to be rather funny . 
  they kill people . 
  what the hell . 
  are you blind ? 
  they are under investigation but they have deep connections with the greek state and they can postpone their trial forever . 
  there is an entire movement in greece with people who are trying to get the trial going and put them in jail already . 
  the greek justice is slower than a turtle and more corrupt than you could ever imagine and the bureaucracy causes delay , and on top of that the eu is ** by the law ** funding a political organisation that actually kills people . 
  the eu is funding ** killers ** . 
  ** by the law ** . 
  if that 's the context in which golden dawn is considered a legit political party legally operating then take your justice and stack it up your ass , cause i do n't want it . 
  learn to observe the truth with your own eyes and stop eating chewed food . 
  you have stopped your brain from working . 
  you live in your tiny pink cloud thinking the eu is a holy place where everything functions . 
  well , it 's not . 
  if you do n't know jack about them how do you know they 're not a criminal organisation ? 
  explain this to me please . 
  because for someone who does n't know you seem a bit biased here .

  in yesterday 's attack no one was harmed and the antifascists were aiming to destroy the building , nothing else . 
  fountoulis and kapelonis knew what they were getting themselves into . 
  that being a criminal organisation . 
  apart from the fact that two people were killed ( the only dead gders ) which is something sad to begin with , i ca n't feel the slightest bit of sympathy for them . 
  in an ideal world golden dawn would be illegal and those two would be in jail before they were dead anyway . 
  having said all that , ** stop fucking normalising fascism , for heaven 's sake . 
  yes , they literally kill random people just because their skin is dark . 
  yesterday they beat the shit out of a random guy in a street close to their headquarters just because he `` looked leftist '' and they `` thought '' he might be responsible for their shop being destroyed . 
  the guy nearly died . 
  what are you trying to justify ? 
  they are still not illegal despite their criminal record , they are supported and favored by the police and the state closes its eyes deliberately . 
  and they still march and riot and pretty much do whatever the fuck they want . 
  somebody has to close their mouth . 
  jesus christ , have n't you got tired of saying this bullshit on the loop for the last 7 years ?
