  did greece cook the books ? 
  yes , it did . 
  did the eu know the books were cooked ? 
  yes , they did . 
  are the problems that greeks face today all created by the cooking of the books ? 
  no , they are n't . 
  it 's been 7 years of recession . 
  and nothing is getting better . 
  with the eu 's help . 
  and you keep missing the whole picture and put the blame on the books ? 
  unemployment in germany diminishing while it 's broadening in southern europe . 
  why ? 
  must be the fucking books . 
  i was watching this live at a local gambling house and the amount of laughter was out of this world . 
  some people were fucking mad but most of them were laughing their lungs off . 
  you 're welcome , mate . 
   i hope so too . 
  keep it going !, 
  the actual effects of brexit may be uncertain , but at least for the time being the forecast is kinda [ optimistic ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2017/jan/25/how-has-the-brexit-vote-affected-the-uk-economy-january-verdict ) . 
  if you do n't like the word , just keep in mind that * nothing is falling apart * as most people in this sub were predicting in the post-referendum paranoia . 
  about the growing of the eu economy , well , allow me to disagree . 
  union-wise the numbers are only slightly improving but at a national level i 'd rather say that inequality is broadening : [ euro area ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/indicators ) , [ germany ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/calendar ) , [ spain ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/spain/indicators ) , [ france ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/france/indicators ) , [ greece ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/indicators ) , [ portugal ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/portugal/indicators ) [ and guess who has the strongest economy right now ] ( http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/economics/british-economy-worlds-strongest-after-brexit/news-story/6c225590e522cbf8830e602b21c9ac31 )  nobody hopes for a downturn that is actually not true , in fact , brexit turning out a success would be disastrous for the eu . 
  it would basically prove that a country can survive outside the union . 
  pro-eu demonstrations are taking place the last week around cities in europe to boost sympathy towards the union - but unfortunately we only see western europeans demonstrating . 
   naive happiness over meaningless data does n't change that . 
  by that logic , `` the eu being prosperous '' is meaningless data too . 
  i did n't say that the numbers revived the prosperity of the british empire or anything . 
  i 'm just not really fond of this empathy towards all mentions of the uk * not yet destroyed by brexit * . 
  everytime someone brings up brexit and the news are not bad enough for their liking people feel the urge to say `` the worst has not come yet '' . 
  just , chill out please . 
   whats your point ? 
  nothing happened yet . 
  that 's exactly his/her point , actually . 
  that all the doomsday scenarios that are speculated since the referendum was announced are proven wrong , and everyone automatically rushes to postpone the day of the apocalypse , when it 's obvious that things get actually better . 
  it 's almost like some people ** want ** the uk to collapse just to feel personal satisfaction for their dystopian predictions . 
  speaking for myself , i really like the way it sounds . 
  vergilio ferreira and jose saramago and the prettiest romance language, 
  yes , and no one was there to maintain what was created thanks to the marshall plan , because the labour shortage was * massive * . 
  germany desperately needed people . 
  you forgot / s. 
  since the 50 's it 's been the immigrants who work your factories and are responsible for a large amount of your gdp , sir . 
  immigrants basically rebuilt germany after the war . 
  do n't be so arrogant because it 's fucking disgraceful . 
  edit : aaand of course i 'm downvoted . 
  anyone defending immigrants gets blindly downvoted here even if he 's speaking the truth . 
  your bigotry is just sad . 
  it seems my grandfather and his brothers and thousands of other men from italy , spain , turkey etc were just enjoying holidays sunbathing on the bank of rhine back in the day . 
  you have unfortunately forgotten . 
  dude , what the actual fuck ... 
   if people have lost some basic abilities of critical thinkinking , it is not my guilt . 
  your guilt is for ** perpetuating the problem ** . 
  you posted this article in order to create false impressions . 
  you put a title beclouding basic information that change ** entirely ** the issue addressed in the article . 
   i have no other agenda than irritate them and make their minds to start function again , and it is good that you feel offended by it . 
  you are not going to do that by hiding information , but from what i can see you do n't even wan na do that . 
  you just want to create havoc over an issue you ** misrepresented ** deliberately , and add it up to the already twisted views people in this sub have expressed over time . 
  you subtracted the logical connection in the words of the president . 
  in the beginning i felt offended by the blatant expediency of the title , now i feel offended for having you say you `` woke me up '' somehow . 
  you hid the truth and you 're playing victim to me because `` all you wanted to do was to wake people up '' ? 
  yeah , good one . 
  your vulgarity is profoundly disgusting . 
   that were ** some of ** the words of monseigneur le president . 
  ftfy you did n't change them , you just did n't bother to write the whole sentence . 
  you know that hiding information is misrepresentation and do n't play dumb to me , because you did it on purpose . 
  you knew what kind of impression people would get from your title because it is a heated subject . 
  i did n't say you ca n't have your own opinion . 
  i said that you ca n't freely push your agenda without being judged about it . 
  people in this sub usually come to false conclusions judging only by the title , and all i asked is that when you decide to spread news you should accompany your articles with an * accurate * title , not with one that includes your views on the matter because doing so is dishonest , to say the least . 
  your personal opinion on the issue does not interest me at all . 
  what the hell people , these comments are so idiotic . 
  do you ever bother to read the article ? 
  also , op , you ** should ** include the whole sentence in the title because the meaning it conveys now is misleading . 
  complete and utter bullshit . 
  i visit exarcheia for the last 8 years and , being a woman , ** never ** in my life have i felt threatened by anyone or anything . 
  neither me nor my female friends . 
  not even my male friends . 
  i 've seen people being hurt by policemen and only on heated days like anniversaries or something . 
  exarcheia is a vibrant neighborhood , multicultural , hosts many cultural exhibitions , cafes , bookstores , etc. 
  you can have yourself misinformed and convinced by the media about the alleged `` dangers '' and so but please do n't spread false information of the sort `` visit only during day '' because it 's disgraceful . 
  this is a heated subject and a matter of perspective . 
  russian and georgian pontioi are documented as `` greeks in russia '' and `` greeks in georgia '' respectively ( on the same note we say greek americans or greeks in germany etc. ) . 
  they are diaspora . 
  and specifically at the time of the ottoman empire they were considered greek . 
  anyway , i understand that many have been assimilated in the countries they live and why one might consider them russian or georgian etc. , but what 's important is the identity they themselves have chosen . 
  and at the era of this guy kosti , pontians in turkey were thought to be greeks . 
   not greek . 
  could be pontian . 
  i suppose ... badly phrased ? 
  rum ( romioi ) are the ethnic greeks of near east and anatolia . 
  i do n't know what you think you 're saying , pontians are greeks . 
  even if the guy was pontian ( which is something you assumed ) , erm , he 's greek . 
  allegedly iran is supporting financially hezbollah and has been likened to al-qaeda and taliban . 
  i can think of a handful of countries that would see iran as a major threat if the allegations are true . 
  having said that , canada , uk and romania being among these countries is hilarious to say the least . 
  edit : guys , it 's not my imagination . 
  [ iran has been accused for having ties with aq and taliban ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iran_and_state-sponsored_terrorism#alleged_al-qaeda_ties ) . 
  i never said i agree :p, 
  this must be one of the most fucking scoldingly arrogant bourgeois comments i 've ever read in this sub . 
   greece is what happens when you do n't have some austerity every once in a while . 
  you are completely delusional .
