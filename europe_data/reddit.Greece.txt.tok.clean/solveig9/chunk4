  especially after an entire century of wars and dictatorships throughout this continent . 
  ** especially ** when collective amnesia leads to [ this kind of situation ] ( https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96c17d626a9dd3cce93458d79efda7b84133bd0b/0_198_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?w=1920&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=73837551c40863cee49895e66faa0b8f ) . 
  fascism is unfortunately taken lightly where it should be condemned and eliminated almost automatically . 
  i am trying to tell it as it is but it seems that whatever farage has ever said is not enough to call him a fascist . 
  honestly , i 'm scared to know what it takes for it to be obvious to everyone . 
  i like my words to be precise . 
  if you have any remarks on their meaning being `` outdated '' then you 're free to correct me . 
  your generic cynicism though is unproductive . 
  he 's a desperate populist demagogue , scapegoating minorities and immigrants and ~ ~ leaching ~ ~ leeching to people like trump and lepen to gain spotlight . 
  i do n't need to have a degree in political science to spot the fascist here . 
  no , i was * not * . 
   how is farage fascist ? 
  [ a brief introduction ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuejc6dlryi ), 
  a fascist idiot being ridiculed while talking pompously is the kind of shit i like to see in this sub . 
  oh , so the issue here is whether we 'll die by a shot in the head or by waterboarding ? 
  according to the erasmian pronounciation , you should say `` beta '' and `` molon labe '' . 
  but greek speakers pronounce words with the contemporary pronounciation because , essentially , it 's the same alphabet . 
  i 've never heard a greek say `` beta '' for example , and even when foreigners pronounce it this way it sound a bit off to my ears , but it 's because i 'm a native speaker . 
  erasmian pronounciation corresponds to ancient greek , so maybe it 's correct to say `` molon labe '' because it 's an ancient saying , but , i do n't know , vita is a letter we use today , every day . 
  same goes for \u03bc and \u03c4 . 
  to be honest , there are 2 pronounciations , the ancient and the modern , in the first case it 's beta , mu and tau , in the latter it 's vita , mi and taf . 
  it 's a matter of preference . 
  there is no right or wrong way , really . 
  just do n't pronounce modern phrases the ancient way . 
  if he was at risk of not having a fair trial in greece or being treated brutally , then it would be the right thing to do . 
  my feelings to his actions would be irrelevant when there is a legal process required to be followed . 
  i 'm definitely not defending anything erdogan has ever said , on the contrary , it is you all who do n't understand that when an entire legislative system overlooks the reality and encourages `` the wrath of the people '' to take over , we 're talking about normalising brutality . 
  this is after 2009 you 're talking about . 
  i do n't give two fucks if it was turkey who claimed him , or usa or china or zimbabwe , it has nothing to do with that , it has nothing to do with him being a criminal or not , for me personally it simply has to do with ** my ** country not chickening up and defending a human being when it is more than obvious that if you give him up he 's going to suffer all the tortures of the world . 
  what he has done is irrelevant , when ** a state ** throws a man in the hole with the lions , humanity has failed . 
  it has nothing to do with the crimes one has committed or not , it has to do with basic human rights and what a country does to protect them . 
  feel free to downvote me all you want . 
  and this is exactly why we did n't handle the crisis with ocalan the right way . 
  anyway , ideologies aside , let 's say that i ca n't even imagine how he must 've felt when he learnt he 'd be brought back to turkey - and how much he must 've have suffered afterwards . 
  that alone is enough . 
  yes , i wholeheartedly believe that not protecting ocalan was a terrible mistake . 
  [ at least we 've learned from the past ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abdullah_%c3%96calan ), 
  * indochine * was my first thought . 
  also , * days of glory * . 
  * out of africa * * amistad * by spielberg , great film . 
  * zulu * with michael caine . 
  quite old but a classic . 
  on the top of my head . 
  sorry i ca n't get you the links , i 'm on mobile . 
  i ca n't thank you enough for this . 
  ok , did you do the math ? 
  you must already have the results , given how confidently you claimed that germans received less money per capita than ** anyone else ** in europe . 
  i 'm waiting . 
  first of all , the link is in german , which i 'm not obliged to speak , and i should reply to you entirely in greek but i 'll try to be kind to you at least . 
  what i 'm trying to say is that germany received money after its lost in ww2 and , according to the link you kindly provided me , those money were 1412 millions of dollars . 
  and it 's primarily because of this money that germany developed so much economically . 
  this does n't seem like a ` cultural advantage ' to me , rather a materialistic one . 
  lastly , your link does n't show the per capita number either . 
   germany received less money from the marshall plan per capita ** than any other european country ** . 
  respond to yourself . 
  [ not quite exactly ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/marshall_plan.svg ), 
  could you be more specific ? 
  what areas of culture define economic success for a nation ? 
  maybe you mean [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marshall_plan ) , by any chance ? 
  what does that even mean ? 
   yeah yeah yeah , do n't look at us , look to the others , but please not at us . 
  we are soo innocent , right ? 
  its always one excuse after the other . 
  this is exactly what you are doing on your behalf right now . 
  nobody in greece says they 're completely innocent but you keep claiming you are . 
  not to mention that your generic ` culture rant ' is extremely offending given the fact that it is more than obvious that you do n't know jack about greek culture . 
  full on . 
  we drink a lot of raki and tsipouro , which is similar . 
  the serbs , too , drink [ rakija ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rakia ) . 
  it 's a thing in the balkans . 
  during the civil war many communists were exiled to ikaria and communism kinda stuck with the locals . 
  the islands are traditionally more liberal than the mainland but particularly in ikaria the communist party gets its highest percentages in all greece . 
  and thus it has become a popular summer destination for greek students who are affiliated with leftist political groups . 
  it 's a great place to go camping , 100 % weed friendly and generally the atmosphere is very laid-back and relaxed . 
  [ check here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edwvuo9gqum ) to grasp the image - it 's from a traditional festival ( we call them ` panigyri ' in greek ) , one of the many that occur every day throughout the island ( and greece in general ) in the summer . 
  food , music , alcohol and all that jazz . 
  i do n't know what it is but it 's the best so far . 
  i suppose it 's ... broken ice ? 
  if the modern city does n't share the same location where the ancient one used to be , and there are ruins , we have to distinguish them somehow . 
  this is the nicest comment i 've ever read in / r/europe , i can totally relate to you . 
  really , thank you for this . 
  it was very heartwarming . 
  why is it such a bad thing to devote time to help people in need ? 
  you 're talking of volunteering like it 's a waste of time . 
  have the taxes you 're paying gone up during this whole time your country provides shelter to refugees ? 
  it 's a genuine question . 
  nobody knows when all this will be over . 
  it can go on for years . 
  if i were a refugee i would n't want to put my life on hiatus for an indefinite amount on time . 
  people are having children in the camps , getting married , you know , life goes on . 
  they feel the need to settle down somewhere , even temporarily . 
  let 's put them in an artificial coma then , until the war is over . 
  he seems like he 's about to say something extremely serious and then he just lags . 
  that and bailey 's laughter for me . 
  bloody hell , steven . 
  that 's very nice . 
  however , forgive me if i 'm wrong , i thought armenia is landlocked , is n't that right ? 
  8 out of 13 regions of greece ( and among them the most populous ones including all major cities ) have a ratio of healthcare personnel  400 per 100.000 inhabitants and still somehow we have one of the shittiest healthcare systems in the eu . 
  and the same is happening in bulgaria . 
  it 's just sad .
