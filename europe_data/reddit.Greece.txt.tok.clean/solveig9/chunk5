  this is clearly butter on the liberals ' bread . 
  i just made this phrase up , as a * possible example * . 
  i 'm not defending it . 
  relax . 
   the suicide rates are inflated because of very low population you know , one could attribute the low population to the harshness of the soviet years . 
  you get me know ? 
  now , it 's been ** 180 ** years since we gained independence . 
  anyone who might assume i 'm muslim or that i speak turkish are simply uneducated and i do n't give two fucks about what they think of me . 
  and i would n't be surprised to hear people confusing me for a turk since due to the many years of the turkish occupation we exchanged many cultural ideas , language , genes , whatever . 
  it is natural . 
  now , imagine how much more natural it is for the world to label you as ex-soviet , considering the fact that you left the union ** 26 freakin years ago ** . 
  this is too recent to get overlooked . 
  unfortunately until the era changes and something really serious happens , like estonia leaving eu or the west cooperating with russia etc , you will be considered ex-soviet . 
  other than that , soviet does n't mean russian and to the people who take you for a russian , you should tell them to go fuck themselves , plain and simple . 
  i know you speak estonian and have grandmas and not babushkas . 
  but for the media and for politics it is very convenient to classify your country and the rest of the baltics as ` ex-soviet ' . 
  as they do with ` the balkans ' , or ` pigs ' , or ` the nordics ' . 
  people like to name things . 
  especially when the names give political connotations . 
  it is truly unfortunate . 
  because you stopped being a soviet republic ** recently ** , because there is still a schism between russia and ` the west ' and because people like making correlations and forcing generalisations . 
  ` lithuania was soviet so * it is justified * that they 're not happy and have the highest suicide rate in the world , * it is justified * that their economy is unstable and they rely heavily on other eu countries ' an example of a simplified statement about the relationship between lithuania 's current situation and its past . 
  it is oversimplified but not entirely false . 
  of course , it is not entirely true either . 
  it 's a stereotype . 
  it 's not my fault that the world is harsh , people . 
  personally i do n't even use the term `` former soviet republic of lithuania '' or whatever . 
   an illegal occupation does n't change when we became independent . 
  an illegal occupation is one of the few things that determine whether the country is independent or not . 
  that 's because when a country is occupied , that means it 's not independent . 
  edit : grammar, 
  ok then , i see . 
  i do n't want to start a heated argument here . 
  from what you 're saying i understand that it 's clearly a matter of perspective . 
  i mean , you 've been collectivised , heavily militarised , tens or maybe hundreds of thousands immigrated to the west or were deported to labour camps , you went through perestroika and glasnost , and after the dissolution you transitioned to a market economy and you started privatising rapidly . 
  this sounds like an ex-soviet state to me . 
  and there 's nothing wrong with being one , given the progress you 've made since the 90 's . 
  you were * occupied * by the soviets , whether this occupation was recognised or not is a sad detail in the political interest conflict between east and west . 
  but you were being administrated in a very soviet-like style for a long-ass time , and when you regained the opportunity to govern your countries the world was not the same it used to be in the 30 's . 
  this is what i mean by ` new state ' . 
  i completely understand the reasons you dislike the label `` ex-soviet '' and you may be right in demanding to repeal this description , but please do n't tell me you were not soviet because `` it was not recognised by the west '' . 
  greece is not a new state , but an ill one which despite being hella old does n't really know how to govern itself . 
  this is a different story . 
  the difference is that greece is independent since 1827 while estonia since 1989 ( correct me if i 'm wrong ) . 
  you are technically a new state . 
  poland was nazi for 6 years . 
  estonia , lithuania and latvia were soviet republics for more than forty . 
  i know that for most people from the baltics any reference to communism or ussr can trigger angry reactions , but why deny the history of your country ? 
  i mean , it has happened . 
  your administration was soviet for many years . 
  you and 15 more people who upvoted you seriously think tsipras is a communist . 
  a * communist * . 
  please open a fucking dictionnary . 
  that 's right , you 're mixing up hellene and helen :p * helen * most possibly means ` bright ' and is connected to * selene-\u03a3\u03b5\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7 * ( = moon ) , although this is still disputed among linguists . 
  * hellene * is disputed too but it is generally accepted that it 's derived from some pre-hellenic language . 
  the meaning is changing constantly through the ages . 
  what is clear though ( for the time being ) is that the two words are not connected , primarily because doubling the \u03bb ( l ) ca n't be explained linguistically . 
  alas , if only such simplistic statements gave answers . 
  fun fact , in greek the word for ` orange ' is \u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03b9 ( portokali ) , and comes from the word ` portugal ' , because it was portuguese merchants who introduced it to the ottoman empire from china . 
  edit : i just looked it up , it 's * porteghal * in persian and * portakal * in turkish too :p, 
  that 's a pretty nice map . 
  i always thought the etymologies of ` sakartvelo ' ( georgia ) and ` t\u00fcrkiye ' were too obvious but turns out i was wrong . 
  it is also speculated that ellada ( greece ) is a pre-hellenic word , from one of the languages spoken here before the indo-europeans came . 
  ukraine 's etymology though : / edit : dear finns , it is said [ here ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dxxzosfsium ) ( implied , rather ) that the word * suomi * comes from the finnish word for swamp ( suo ) . 
  is that generally believed ? 
  it 's a reference to the peloponnesian war ( 431-404 bc ) , where athens and its allies fought against the peloponnesian league , a coalition of some greek city-states , among which some islands too . 
  the peloponnesian league was led by sparta ( ancient name : lacedaemon ) . 
  the most decisive battle took plake in syracusae , sicily , and the spartans won . 
  the war is considered one of the most important of the ancient greek world . 
  we have the same percentage as japan ? 
  this is the shock of the day . 
  dude , thanks for this comment . 
  really . 
  [ true love ] ( http://luben.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/cm9vh4dwyaafasv.jpg ) also til that a group of `` to potami '' mps organised a party to celebrate the victory of hillary clinton some 3-4 days ** before ** the election took place . 
  and [ those guys are in our parliament ] ( http://www.thetoc.gr/images/articles/1/article_58156/upl54d37a039493f.jpg ) . 
  welcome to the bipolar republic !, 
  i 'm really happy for portugal . 
  we too have won a euro and then some months later the eurovision . 
  i hope this turns out well for you guys , not like it did for us , and that more good things are yet to come . 
  i honestly do n't understand why this should be so interesting or awe-inspiring . 
  it 's not like he 's 20 or something . 
  the way i see it is just that people love to name things and the phrase `` the youngest leader in ( enter country 's name ) 's history '' is quite a catchy one . 
  there is no deep or actual meaning ( especially since it does n't reflect to his political views anyway . ), 
  we did back in 2011 , [ did n't end quite well ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlvml5ih2qs ) . 
  lol the downvotes . 
  [ must 've hurt quite a bit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azhvd0ks7es ) : /, 
   overwhelming majority of people wants the best for everyone . 
  no , overwhelming majority of people do n't give two fucks about how the neighbor 's doing as long as their ass is safe and good . 
   the online advantage will help curb many additional costs which essentially means that , when the auctions will take place online , there will be no sabotaging . 
  as of now that auctions are public , syndicates and citizen protection organisations are desperately trying to prevent the despicable sellout of properties which are often the main residence of their destitute owners . 
  even notaries are on strike resisting to cooperate , but it seems that when it comes to strain the poor , there 's always a way , right ? 
  just plain fuck you , i 've got nothing else to say . 
  shame . 
  an economic crisis that was triggered by greek mismanagement and dragged by european officials who had interest in keeping it alive , which is essentially what creates unemployment in greece but surplus of work positions in western europe . 
  like europe is 100 % innocent about the stretching of our crisis , man . 
  yeah , we were completely alone in `` solving '' it . 
  the point is to be able to work in your country . 
  europe is not a federation . 
  i want to work in my country , i ca n't , but you tell me now that i should be happy that i ca n't , because there are other places i can go . 
  seems so comforting .
