i am well aware that he left syriza , but can you you tell me which party did he form and what percentage of the votes did that party get in the last greek elections ? 
  how about you take a minute and google the results of the last greek elections in order to learn that varoufakis ' party won the elections ? 
  lol , no, 
  ahh , yes . 
  i forgot to say that we greeks ** did ** fuck up big time . 
  major reforms have to take place here in greece . 
  but you forget that not everyone was living the dream . 
  there were , and still are , many people ( admittedly not most ) that are getting fucked . 
  some people indeed `` deserve to be treated bad '' but for the last 5 years they are not !, 
  not everyone has the same ** exact ** share of responsibility and the last 5 years have not been equally shitty for everyone . 
  justice must be served but that 's not what is happening these last years . 
  and i also do n't understand why the bankers , that were giving out loans like there was no tomorrow , bear absolutely no responsibility and they have to be saved no matter what the cost is . 
  exactly . 
  oh , but i am partying . 
  it 's just that i have so much fun watching all of you guys going crazy about syriza ( `` dem commies '' , `` kick 'em out now '' , `` they took our monies ! '' ) . 
  throwing all that mud at them without even once actually seeing what they say and what they suggest ( varoufakis specifically ) and then criticize that . 
  i wonder why none of you does that ... 
  thanks for not answering though . 
   they do n't have to follow the eu 's plans why the hell should they ? 
  is n't that what they were doing the last 5 years ? 
  where did that get us ? 
   and in return they do n't get the eu 's money . 
  we 're gon na have to wait and see about that one ...   ... thats like ** me ** ... ** my neighbor ** has to pay ... if ** i ** just stay ... ** i ** still get the money but ** my ** neighbor suffers the ol' `` a country 's economy is just like a household . 
  ai n't nobody need ` conomic sciences and such , my grandma had figured out everything ` bout ` conomics many decades ago ! '' . 
  that 's the spirit son . 
  keep it up . 
   greece did n't have to accept the bailout funds from the imf at all . 
  right . 
  there were n't any guns pointed at anyone ...  debts were written off in 2010 and 2012 . 
  there were n't any debt 's written off in 2010 . 
  and the ones in 2012 were too little too late . 
  but who cares about the debt when the conditions attached to the `` bailouts '' are bound to destroy the economy ? 
   the eu has a 2 billion programme for unemployed young greeks . 
  [ this one ? 
  ] ( http://www.aa.com.tr/en/economy/481397--eu-to-give-greece-2-billion-for-economic-boost ) i do n't , the eu is moving too fast , maybe they should wait another 5 years and see what happens . 
  ** / s **  perhaps you could explain what more help greece should become perhaps ** you ** can explain to ** us ** [ this one ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/jobs-growth-investment/plan/index_en.htm ) . 
  why are they doing this ? 
  why so ~ ~ late ~ ~ early ? 
  i like the fact that propaganda can come only from one side ( syriza ) and not the other one ( eu ) . 
   promissing the impossible and then realizing that they ca n't deliver on their promises this reminds me of something ... about some `` bailouts '' and their conditions that were supposed to bring growth or something ? 
  anyone remember that ? 
  and now they 're doing something called qe and talk about a european investment plan ? 
  what happened to austerity guys ? 
  interesting last paragraph . 
  yes , of course . 
  treating symptoms is the best course of action we could possibly follow . 
  look mate , i 'm not going to explain every little thing for you to understand it . 
  i said tanks and subs as an example in order for the geniuses like you to get the goddamn gist . 
  obviously , this did not happen ... 
   greece does n't have many achievements to show . 
  i simply told you what we have to show . 
  same excellent purchase decisions ( among other excellent decisions ) , for which no one ever said : `` hmm , that does n't look like it 's gon na end well . 
  maybe we should stop giving them all that money ... '' . 
  that 's simply not true . 
  we have a lot of german tanks and cars and submarines . 
  we are some of the best customers of germany . 
  you know germany , with their amazing export-driven economy ... 
   yes most of the money did not go to greece ... but why should it ? 
  exactly !, 
  the money had to go to those hard-working and good-willing bankers that have to be rewarded for their hard and honest work , no matter what !!, 
  those poor bankers were tricked by those treacherous greeks into giving them money !, 
  do n't get me wrong . 
  the greek society has a lot of problems that have to be addressed . 
  when we started firing all those civil servants i was kinda glad that that 's what was happening . 
  turns out it was n't . 
  5 years later and we are in worse position from the one we started . 
  worry not though !, 
  [ european commission 's fast reflexes are going to save us all !,

   two weeks ago , tsipras was standing safely on morale high ground when he rightfully demanded compensations from germany for the forced greek loans by the nazis . 
  and how exactly did that turn out for him ? 
  everyone was saying that tsipras is playing the nazi card to extort more money , thus germany must not yield . 
  and standing on morale high ground does n't really help our economy . 
   now , he turns around and tries to get close with the one country in europe/asia that annexed ... 
  i know it 's kinda fucked , but did anyone tried to consider why he does that ? 
  that maybe he feels that he is in a very bad situation ? 
  it does n't seem so ... 
  lol . 
  so much butthurt in this thread !!, 
  indeed , for me it 's cheap lie , for many greeks though it 's the sad sad truth . 
  it 's bureaucracy . 
  learn to spell . 
  i had 100 $ . 
  i was between buying food for a month and paying for electricity , water , etc. 
  or paying my taxes . 
  now i 'm a tax evader . 
  i really like it when you say things i have n't said . 
  i really do !!, 
   suddenly stop importing german products i never said that . 
  i said not being able to import . 
  i wonder how come and you did n't notice that ...  just to support your anti-german bias of course , whatever you like . 
  lol . 
  care to enlighten me as to why the ez was constructed ? 
  you seem to know everything and have a solution about everything . 
  yeah ... about that ... it was millions after all . 
  800 million . 
  germany is a `` well functioning smooth machine '' as long as there are countries able to consume its products . 
  if those countries stop consuming germany 's products then the `` well functioning smooth machine '' will run out of oil and die ... 
  it is obvious from our conversation that you have absolutely no idea how economies work in a global level . 
  i suggest that you read a little bit about keynes , bretton woods , surplus recycling and beggar-thy-neighbour policy .
