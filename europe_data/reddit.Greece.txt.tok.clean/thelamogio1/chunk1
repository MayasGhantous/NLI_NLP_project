did i hit a nerve ? 
  anyway , have fun committing genocides or whatever it is your people are fond of doing ... 
  not all countries lack the morals to get rich by making deals with isis like turkey does . 
  [ reminds me of this ] ( http://new1.fjcdn.com/large/pictures/d7/4f/d74fbe_5484681.jpg ), 
  all tourists entering greece will be handed a brochure which will inform them that weed is illegal here and they should n't bother asking where they can get some ( come on people !, 
  you come here on vacation !, 
  instead of sitting in you hotel room smoking pot you can go to the beach , talk to a girl , drink a beer , visit a museum or at least eat a souvlaki ... you know something other than weed all day long ! ), 
  it asked me to disable adblock ... guess i will not read the article, 
  here are some sayings and expressions from greece and their meaning ( some may be a bit vulgar ) . 
  * `` the liar and the thief are happy only for a year/the first year '' : your shitty behavior will initially benefit you , but soon you will have to answer for it . 
  * `` he produces fat even from the fly '' : when someone overworks others or makes them pay a lot for something when they should n't . 
  ex : - i went to a restaurant and they even charged me for a glass of water !, 
  - what did you expect ? 
  the people who run the place make fat even from the flies !, 
  * `` the children of the wise cook before they are hungry '' : if you are smart you plan ahead . 
  * `` he wanders around like an unfair curse '' : he goes around places without any purpose or goal . 
  * `` the smart bird is caught by its beak '' many otherwise smart and/or powerful people often have very obvious weaknesses that can be exploited easily . 
  * `` you are going to fart on my testicles '' : a common response to a threat , it means that you are going to get fucked and the only resistance you will put up is farting . 
  ex : - i will kick your ass bitch !, 
  - yeah sure , you will fart on my testicles !, 
  * `` he became a turk '' : he got very very angry * `` he pretends to be chinese '' : tries to avoid a question by changing subject or playing stupid but being very obvious about it ... like a greek trying to pass as a chinese . 
  * `` he pretends to be a duck '' : in greek ducks are supposed to go `` pa pa pa '' and one ( childish , or over the top ) equivalent to `` nope , no '' is saying `` apapapapa '' . 
  it sounds very childish and guilty so when you say someone pretends to be a duck you mean that they are actually bullshiting you . 
  ex : did you ask him if he ate my chocolate ? 
  yes , but he pretended to be a duck !, 
  * `` we must present the blind 's right too '' : we must be fair to everyone . 
  * `` fatme shat herself at yeni mosque '' something of no concern to me happened usually in response to hearing news that you do n't care about . 
  ex : - justin bieber revealed that he is gay !, 
  fatme shat herself at yeni mosque !!, 
  * `` a priest ? 
  a priest ? 
  you will have to wait in line '' : all people are equal , you do not deserve any special treatment . 
  * `` whoever hurries , trips '' : do n't rush things * `` the fly grew an asshole and shat all over the world !, 
  '' : some people go overboard when they get even the tiniest amount of power in their hands . 
  * `` each hand washes the other and both the face '' : we have to work together if we are to do great things . 
  * `` the cunt can tug a boat '' : many men only think with their dicks , women can use that to their advantage . 
  * `` crazy women and sluts have good fortune/marry well '' : sort of the equivalent of `` good guys finish last '' but for girls . 
  i hate gd with a passion but i would find it very rude if someone talking to me called fyrom macedonia . 
  sun tsu = macedonksi, 
  while i hate gd as much as anyone whose grandfather fought the nazis i believe that this time that gd is right . 
  the reporter was either ignorant or wanted to provoke them . 
  greece has a naming dispute with fyrom , either understand that or gtfo, 
  how i feel about the other southern europeans ? 
  well most of you were [ family at some point ] ( http://wps.ablongman.com/wps/media/objects/262/268312/art/figures/kish_02_34.gif ) does your people have a shitty habit ? 
  well , you can safely blame it to our influence !, 
  joking aside i really like you all !, 
  i especially like the albanians , the bulgarians , the french and the spanish , mainly because i have met more people from these countries than the rest . 
  i have n't encountered anyone hating germany . 
  most people are pissed with tsipras and his fooling around and many are disappointed with eu not providing a clear solution that all members follow, 
  whenever i am convinced that the left wing are the kings and queens of idiocy , the right wing always sweeps in and steals the crown for themselves !, 
  i sometimes hear people refer to them by color ie `` how much does it cost ? 
  gim me a blue and we are fine ! '', 
  also instead of saying for example `` a twenty euro bill '' many people call them a twentyeuro ( \u03b5\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03b1\u03b5\u03c5\u03c1\u03c9 ) , a fiftyeuro ( \u03c0\u03b5\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b5\u03c5\u03c1\u03c9 ) etc like in a single word . 
  aka : how to make political asylum switch from being a democratic and humane action into a joke, 
  fire on boats filled with unarmed civilians , women and children obviously ... you know the christian/european/humane thing to do !, 
  `` you call 100 $ a bribe ?!, 
  make it 500 $ and then we talk again ! '', 
  [ bitch please ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/unemployment-rate ), 
  the czechs are very smart and likable people , how they elected such a fool for a president is beyond me . 
  sorry but you are wrong here . 
  greece : often the biscuits will be shared between the visitor and the host unless the host has something else available . 
  usually the host would also give the visitor a gift as well . 
  fun fact : in villages it is not uncommon to go for a visit empty handed and leave carrying a couple of bags full with treats , fruits and vegetables produced by the host . 
  unless we take into account drug addicts ( who can not easily find employment ( even in thriving economies ) and would do anything in order to afford the next dose ) the study is completely out of touch with reality . 
  the sex trade in greece is dominated by foreign girls who offer sex for as low as 10-20 $ ( women over 50 years old ) to 50 - 100 $ + ( fit 20-30 year old women ) . 
  there are greek women who work as prostitutes but they are a small minority and are actually quite sought after .

  us/russian/eu weapons manufacturers, 
   crusader syndrome i like that term , they should include it in the next version of the dsm !, 
   they can ask far less money than a young greek what a country with a gigantic youth unemployment problem ( 49 % ) needs right now ... 
  everything is fine ... to be honest i am proud by how we are handling the situation . 
  i mean even when the capital controls began and everyone got scared , people just formed peaceful lines at the atms and everything was as usual ( for the people at least , business lost a lot of money because of this retarded measure but this is another story ) also while there are some demonstrations , they are not dangerous and usually contained at a specific area at the center of athens ( the police usually cuts traffic to this area during demonstrations , which means that you have to really go out of your way in order to even see protesters !, 
  i really like the flag of wales ... [ it has a fucking badass dragon on it !, 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/flag_of_wales_2.svg/2000px-flag_of_wales_2.svg.png ), 
  yep , the ship owners would simply switch their fleet flags to a country 's that will not tax them anything , the same day the law is passed . 
  the med diet + sun combo seems to be still doing wonders even if we do our best to die by constantly smoking and driving like mad men all the time !, 
  officially in greece beer is called \u03b6\u03c5\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 ( brewery in greek is \u03b6\u03c5\u03b8\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03af\u03b1 for example ) however everyone uses the word \u03bc\u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1 ( bira ) when refering to the drink itself . 
  some manufacturers use either name or [ both ] ( http://kosmarket.gr/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/5202382900038-2.jpg ), 
  where is thaaat ?? 
  oh my god , they cooked `` elderly couple pasta '' ? 
  i 've heard about police brutality but never expected it to evolve into cannibalism !, 
  not to mention that in order for the swimmers to bother to call the police he was doing something that annoyed them a lot , like taking creepy photos of girls in their bikinis without asking for permission for example . 
  i think that you are right , [ they ] ( http://moufanet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/20150324124434_img_57361427195991.jpg ) have silly vehicles just [ like team rocket ] ( http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/d/d0/bw130_error_3.png ), 
  and everything was organized by team epsilon ( lol they sound like a pokemon villain ), 
  to be honest i was mainly referring to their computers , for a gamer on the pc the same money could buy you quite a beast . 
  the phones are ok and i liked the iphone i used to have but ever since i got my first high end android device i decided that apple was no longer for me . 
  [ hoplitodromos ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/hoplitodromos_louvre_mn704.jpg ) is more appropriate if people want a martial-like sport included in the games . 
  i call them shitty because they sold out their customer and also because the prices of their products are not proportional to the hardware they offer . 
  ( this is of course if your reply was because you are a fan of apple . 
  if this was a veiled attempt at a '' hurr durr pay debtz poor greek '' jab , please do fuck off ), 
  fuck apple and their shitty overpriced phones !, 
  we still have pirate bay and the next site that will replace kickass sooner or later , such arrests are pointless if you ask me . 
  edit : btw fuck apple for handing over tirm 's information to the feds . 
  why does turkey always feel the need to involve us in their bullshit ? 
  [ palpatine approves ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/9/9a/palp_trustme.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20070114040526 ), 
  you post 2edgy4u crap about bootlicking and blowjobs , you call me a `` little greekling '' and then are still able to call me immature . 
  seriously , thanks for making me laugh buddy !, 
  you have a point and it may possibly cause more lynching or beheadings like i heard already happened shortly after the coup failed .
