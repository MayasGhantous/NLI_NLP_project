  [ hehe thnx man !, 
  nah , unfortunately i do n't think they will , unless we raise enough global awareness for this crime . 
  this area is a huge vote pool for the government . 
  corruption at its finest ... 
  lol , thnx i am too lazy to read the formatting guide for reddit :p,

  i knew something like that was happening but i did n't know how to search about it . 
  thanks man !, 
  yeap , is it me or are we heading towards a chinese type of labor relations in europe ? 
  yeap probably they were shooting at them for intimidation . 
  this area of the country has a history in immigrant abuse , treating them worse than animals . 
  i am trying to find a more updated article in english . 
  current condition is ~ 200 men shot with shotguns by 3 supervisors 28 men injured 4 in critical condition 8 in serious condition 16 slightly injured if i find something more updated in english i will edit .

  modern greece has many things in common with ancient greece . 
  for example we still have slaves . 
  the exploitation of immigrant workers by wealthy farmers goes back a decade or so . 
  crete is well known throughout greeks for its amazing beaches . 
  chania is well known throughout crete for its beauty . 
  check this out . 
  dammit , 56 days left till i move permanently there once again !, 
  too fkn long time !, 
  :( on topic , my best videos of promotion was some years past with these series of videos http://youtu.be/wfiaistvyea ps chania rulez !, 
  indeed they have . 
  is dutch similar to german ? 
  i too , am considering to learn a foreign language ... i thought about japanese , but now you say it i never thought of dutch , 
  wtf are you saying ? 
  do n't put words into my mouth !, 
  this conversation is not who 's fault is for the worldwide economic crisis , its about cretans being economically independent when they are based on their own land and that its bullshit when you use the collective blaming against a country/island or whatnot . 
  and by the way , i do n't give a sh * t about syriza anel or any other moronic political party, 
  yeah right 1/4 , these sites should better make it 3/4 for one man , and be even more critical against that . 
  are you freaking serious ? 
  you want me to write you down all the nd/pasok high members of chania ? 
  i only mentioned that worm because he is now appointed in a committee that strives for `` clean politics '' ... there are many worms like him but for sure not 20 thousand cretans !, 
  get a grip of yourself !, 
  i need to see that kind of statue xd, 
  having read all that , i see we agree that there is no real journalism in the most of greek press but rather a misguiding populism . 
  but if you do n't see the oppression to the press i.e. 
  the arrest of vaxevanis and the threats of his life , the dismissal of journalists from the national television channels because they did a report that revealed some evidence against some popular mps in the government or some others made a witty comment about a minister , the death threats of journalists who wrote an article revealing the corruption and the bribing of officials from a wealthy shipowner from the shipowner himself ! ), 
  and many many other examples then i do n't know what to write to convince you ... 
  hehehehe !!, 
  i am doomed to see my failures :p, 
  i understand that you confuse shit for truth and truth for shit you poor misunderstanding little man . 
  i insist saying what i said , and now i see you can read greek , go ahead and read this magazine article http://www.koutipandoras.gr/33561/%cf%80%cf%8c%cf%83%ce%bf-%ce%bc%ce%b1%cf%81%ce%ba%ce%bf%ce%b3%ce%b9%ce%b1%ce%bd%ce%bd%ce%ac%ce%ba%ce%b7%cf%82-%ce%b5%ce%af%cf%83%ce%b1%ce%b9.html if you are not willing to give money and buy this magazine , let me tell you that confirms exactly what i told you : government officials ripping off greek state of its money and pensions in order to feed their own lackeys and mafia criminals in the island ( with various ways , including these social welfare pensions and eu money abuse , which you do n't say that those syndicalists are now high positioned in the offices of prominent government mps -- btw nice independed sites you provide me for information , i can see your sources and can understand your ignorance and bias ) i really hope gd members will become extinct in the following years , as well as ignorance and stupidity ... 
  one of the greatest offends in a traditional wedding table is to be `` called upon '' by name receiving a good fortune wish and not respond immediately calling another of your choosing some wish and emptying your cup of wine with one gulp ... this custom results in a domino of drinking wine too quickly and getting drunk really fast !, 
  i have lasted for 6-7 rounds i dont remember exactly :p, 
  http://content-mcdn.imerisia.gr/filesystem/images/20120613/engine/imerisia_large_t_1061_43390772_type12128.jpg this happens when you let nazis run free ... one mild photo of thousands of victims in the past 5 years of the rise of greek neo-nazis, 
  so to you , humans should live heating frozen genetically modified premade meals made by multinational corporations , living in grey tenements 20 families in each to be close to work , work 14 hours a day 7 days a week and paid slightly more than a months rent in that cages , getting yelled at by their employers and complain to other people that they live too well ? 
  because the vast majority of cretans in my age around the chania municipality live similar to the following routine at this time of year : they wake up early ( 5-6 ) to attend their affairs at fields/hotels/taverns / goats , get the job done * around 1-2 hours after noon and either help their relatives/friends to their work or go for a walk to the beautiful countryside/go for a swim , return to their owned home which normally has a garden/porch drink some raki and get ready to eat the things i wrote before . 
  at afternoon , they plan tomorrows actions and work , after that they go to `` cafenio '' to drink some coffee or raki and listen to lyra playing till the night begins to fall http://youtu.be/xprg7kdhnse * and by `` getting the job done '' i mean that these people produce more money using their land and their islands beauty , without being depended on governments funds and eu programs ( which all those years was being advertised , but only 5-10 % of those funds was delivered !, 
  the rest being lost to corrupt government officials and their lackeys , the same who now support austerity measures against greeks ) ps at the city there is less free time , most work on service areas and they end work depending their own schedule so usually they dont have the time to help friends/family . 
  but they still manage to be independent from decadent `` big city life '' as you imagine the normal life of modern people . 
  hmm , lets hope that this initiative is a start for a change , 
  dammit !, 
  sorry i am a bit new to reddit , 
  amazing !, 
  just posted a question here about this kind of journalism !, 
  i wanted to ask you , is a common thing for dutch society to crowd fund an idea in order to support independent journalism ? 
  the only funny thing is that these few serious journalists do n't need to be focused all day long with those accusations . 
  they said it or implied it once or twice and after that , the work of these journalists was filtered away from public , especially in the tv , internet newsportals and radio areas . 
  the criticism they claim to use against memorandum and low acceptance governmental choices , is nothing than a cover from the people . 
  they use criticism only when it is convenient for the government and when they are sure that wo n't have any effect ( i.e. 
  before the vote of each memorandum they bombarded the people with what would happen if the government did n't chose to accept it and filtering out all those `` heterodox pundits '' you mention , closing all different opinions and making it seem the only way ... while after some time , many `` journalists '' furiously criticised the government for voting it and the `` bad germans '' for the woes of every poor greek ( while a few months ago the same openly supported this option-madness or goebbelism ? ) ), 
  its the same type of journalism that spiegel does when it writes for lazy greeks , spanish and portoguese ... in greece this type of corrupt journalism its widespread in the 99,99 % of the media . 
  searching for a convenient scapegoat to use and changes it depending on the situation . 
  using no facts , no evidence , just find someone to blame . 
  when they ca n't cover anymore the greek government and remain `` media that care about the truth '' , they criticize with minimum damage made possible and invite in a `` panel talk '' some of those people you mentioned and many government elements and in a ratio 1:4 . 
  for instance last time i tried to watch a video at youtube from varoufakis in a greek tv station programme they had him to defend his opinion against 5 government positioned people who were constantly driving the conversation off the cliff !, 
  when it was varoufakis turn to talk , the programme host `` journalist '' would let him speak for about 20-30 seconds and after that would say to him all the time to please `` hurry up '' and `` others need to speak '' , then about a minute later would take his turn and give it to another who constantly talked for about 12 minutes !!!!!, 
  a nice report from reuters . 
  http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/17/us-greece-media-idusbre8bg0cf20121217 after that , reuters was considered an `` agent of evil '' by greek mass media , in many panel talks , while they did not made one reference to the existence of this article . 
  some months later they returned to normal , citing reuters as a trustworthy news source ... no comment ... 
  10 years in chania my friend ... cretans know how to live ;d, 
  yo do us a favor ... take your supremacist friends and join them in the bottom of the sea . 
  i go to sleep now , when i wake up i hope you have deleted your filthy post, 
  so you want to see the real cretan delicacies heh ? 
  start with staka ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roux#cretan_staka ) accompanied by french fries and dakos ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dakos ) order a salad , you have the tough choice between palikaria ( mixture of beans http://www.cretan-oil.gr/index.php/en/recipes/palikaria-or-polisporia ) and the traditional choriatiki ( http://www.agora-restaurant.gr/gr/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/greek-salad-new.jpg ) time to start feeling a bit hungry , continue with chochlius boubouristous ( escargots made the cretan way  and drink some cretan raki with some sigglino ( smoked meat -- http://www.paterakisfamily.gr/images/cretan5.jpg ) , waiting for the main course to arrive for the main course i strongly recommend soupia with maratho ( squid -- http://i52.tinypic.com/2vb1tom.jpg ) to taste something fresh from the sea ... unless you want moaar meat !!!, 
  then you should get arnaki with kolokithakia ( lamb with zucchini http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_lpcxnkxci_w/tatxwy1uv5i/aaaaaaaabme/a2tckfdttqw/s1600/dsc06557.jpg ) after this its time for relaxation and zen contemplation to get ready for the deserts ... mizithropita with meli ( pie with honey ) and traditional pecan pie with raki syrup ... 
  this was my typical meal whenever i had the opportunity to visit my friends granparents at chania ... i begged them to stop feeding me , but they were very oppressive :p if you want i can write you a couple of things about the alcohol down there , 
  i 'm sure you will have a wonderful time . 
  if you visit chania municipality you should definitely visit elafonisi at the south and balos at nw ... pretty far from the city but worth travelling there , 
  i lived 10 years in chania , creta . 
  from my friends at the island i was informed that the people that went to defend those who were being beaten/harassed from gd cretins , were a mixture of a wide political range ( communists from kke/antarsya , anarchists from rosa nera , bystanders who were taking a walk in the evening at the old harbor , waiters etc ) that makes me extra proud, 
  no way !!!, 
  no comments ... 
  just to clarify , the `` little mermaid '' was a mp candidate ( sorry , i do n't know how to edit title ), 
  yeap the story is old as the time itself ... but things got worse lately when the few neutral remaining journalists were chased and marked as `` traitors '' `` untrustworthy '' and `` agents of evil foreigners '' . 
  even at social networks such as twitter , different opinions than the official status about anything are bombarded by hired trolls, 
  in greece these `` rumors '' are widely known and considered a fact . 
  the only thing that forces guardian to put that word is the fear of lawsuits ... anyway the real danger is the intent of neo-nazi expansion in the world using the economic crisis as excuse !, 
  well those wealthy greeks were never poor self-made capitalists . 
  they were close friends of all past and recent governments and they made their fortune by leeching greek state 's resources and employing thugs like golden dawn prominent members to silence dissidents .
