  so no problem for them to use them once again to spread fear and distrust in greek society, 
  salonica ... the city for us guys to live :d, 
  epic prank is epic, 
  greek investigative journalist kostas vaxevanis was awarded the 2012 index on censorship journalism award , sponsored by the guardian . 
  this is an extract from his acceptance speech, 
  i strongly disagree with you . 
  money could be loaned with different terms . 
  do n't forget that germany was in the same situation in 1953 . 
  in that time , there was an agreement on german external debts ( london agreement on german external debts ) in which the debt of germany was cut of and the country was given significant help to recover . 
  i should point out that , in countries included , were spain , greece , ireland etc. 
  countries that now have the same problem . 
  also you say that the current situation is the fault of the major unions because : 1 ) with strikes forced the government to slash wages rather than to fire civil servants . 
  but with narrowing the solution with only 2 options , you overlook the most important option . 
  tax the rich oligarchs of greek society ( something that greek government does n't do because it works for them ) so as you see ( 1 ) were just trying to pressure the government to do the right thing 2 ) they resist the total liberalization of greek economy . 
  i respond with the example of privatization of british rail . 
  not only the system made the life of passengers a complex nightmare , but also led in a dramatic increase of fatal train accidents . 
  i am saying that not everything is working for the best when is privatized . 
  so as you see ( 2 ) were trying to protect the decency of public state . 
  to reform greece is difficult , but not for your reasons . 
  its difficult because the governing politicians are corrupt beyond measure and the union where this country is into , is acting like a loanshark, 
  so beautiful , cant be ignored , 
  i did n't say that germany is to blame for the failings of greek state . 
  government of germany is acting like an usurer , using its votes in eu parliament to force loans , with terms that even shylock would not imagine , instead , for example , signing a debt relief treaty ... that policy led europe and its million citizens in a terrible crisis . 
  and that 's why i blame german government, 
  there is a difference between being altruistic and colonizing every european nation in the name of european union i agree that our politicians are the worst , 
  eurozone is now demonstrably controlled by german power . 
  and that german power seems much more interested in german interests . 
  to the point where they can use the eurozone to take money from other countries . 
  to translate , germany uses the eurozone mechanism to take money from russia . 
  government of germany bullies freely for some time now . 
  merkel governs germany as for growing up http://jp3.r0tt.com/l_0966ee80-681c-11e1-92c2-65e861b00003.jpg as for `` shitty country '' http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_u7w5oabrwjc/turkb7qtyei/aaaaaaaaaba/zzvf4uqboyi/s1600/mpalos1.jpg, 
  damnit , last time merkel was up for re-election , she crippled greece ... now she tries to cripple cyprus . 
  thank god there is no other greek official speaking country in the world for her next elections, 
  well then , fire them all !, 
  well i hope they will follow the `` do-it-like-iceland '' way of solution http://youtu.be/21cuq8ye6wc, 
  russian-germanic game of chess ... interesting, 
  and a little bit more than worse :p, 
  well , lately there is some tension in northern greece with canadian officials and companies because they are trying to destroy some forests and amazingly beautiful landscapes in order to build some gold mines ... but we still love canadian people :d http://youtu.be/xuihivv2trs, 
  i am sorry if i was giving the impression that this article had evidence that absolves greece ... i was trying to point out with this article that it was n't greece 's fault , but the economy 's fault in general for the whole eurocrisis, 
  exactly !, 
  as i was commenting in another post : in greece its an oligarchy rather than a monarchy . 
  whoever controls the media , controls the country and doesnt pay taxes one of the last journalists in my country has written a very interesting short article about his situation in ny times ... feel free to read http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/opinion/greeces-rotten-oligarchy.html?_r=0, 
  :p hahaha ... i downvoted you , now upvoted !, 
  sorry but you were very convincing man !, 
  why , thank you for your kind wishes !, 
  die you american scum !!!, 
  :p yeah i know what you mean man ... xd, 
  yeap , my serbian friend ... that happens when you built a giant but you provide glass material for the legs , 
  dear fellow european , it was not greece 's fault ... 
  this article by bbc explains it better ... free market destroyed , media convinced http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16290598 ( it has also nice pictures/graphs :d ), 
  in greece its an oligarchy rather than a monarchy . 
  it is true , as another greek guy said , that whoever controls the media , controls the country one of the last journalists in my country has written a very interesting short article about his situation in ny times ... feel free to read http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/opinion/greeces-rotten-oligarchy.html?_r=0 if you want some names , try bobolas , angelopoulos family , latsis , vardinogiannis , kokkalis btw another interesting article http://www.businessinsider.com/the-wealthiest-greeks-2010-5?op=1, 
  fellow anarchist , capitalism happened http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%e2%80%932013_irish_financial_crisis edit : same thing that happens in greece , spain , italy , portugal etc. . . 
  do n't pay attention guys ... they have their own problems in their government and they try to stir their population eyes to a more `` ethnic glory '' propaganda ... http://news.yahoo.com/least-22-people-injured-macedonia-riots-220940082.html also its in favor of greek politicians also to continue the dispute , as greeks are very unhappy with their government . 
  here journalism is dead long ago ... http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/29/greek-journalists-warn-press-freedom, 
  you are mistaken my friend , for the last years we are running a surplus , and we have n't taken any money since last july . 
  as for the `` poorer '' part , poorer than what ? 
  my luckiest friends are getting paid 580/month for 10 hour a day jobs , i am currently getting paid 320/month for 4 hour a day job ... i have seen many in the brink of suicide out of pride , cause they could n't pay their montly expenses , hear about friends who commited that ... do not tell me of getting poorer please !, 
  you do not know poor !, 
  edit : feeling grumpy , i woke up at 5:30 to commute to work ... 
  this has two meanings , i will go with the positive one , 
  both opinions are exaggerations ... it 's not the end of the world after all , 
  i work part-time as a customer service phone agent for a greek number catalog company , so in 4 hours i speak with around 240 greeks and give telephone numbers . 
  today 80 % of my calls were about bank numbers mostly by elderly folk ... the astonishing thing is that even when almost all of them were angry with the banks ( they were cursing at them , a common thing in my job ) , most of them were optimistic with a prideful attitude . 
  for instance after i gave a telephone number of a bank to an old lady calling from salonica she said `` to hell with them ( she meant the bankers ) !, 
  if the `` no '' wins it will be a second politexneio ( refering to [ athens polytechnic uprising ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/athens_polytechnic_uprising ) ) after i finished my job , my commute passes through many bank atms , and i saw people with worried faces , also mostly elderly , who had their savings book at their hands ... to conclude , all of my friends and family are both worried and happy for this turn of events and hope that `` no '' will prevail , even if it takes us out of eurozone . 
  warning wall of text that explains the serb/greek friendship stuff : the notion of a special relationship between greece and serbia and a feeling of attachment due to historical and cultural factors has been fostered at least since the formation of the greek and serbian national states in the 19th century in the public discourse of both countries . 
  depending on the political upswings and downswings , this discourse saw different tides : in times of co-belligerence as it was the case in the balkan wars , it served the interests of the foreign policies of both states , whereas it was ignored during and after the greek civil war against the background of tito \u201f s support for the greek communists . 
  although historical examples of positive stereotyping of the other existed , it was not until the yugoslav wars in the 1990s that the idea of a traditionally contingent friendship was constructed and perpetuated in the greek and serbian media . 
  within the context of an `` ever-lasting and existing friendship '' , the shared orthodox faith and byzantine heritage , the pioneering task in the `` national uprisings and fights '' against the ottomans and the co-belligerence in different wars as well as dynastic relations were defined as determining factors . 
  on this ground a `` common destiny '' and `` special emotional solidarity and proximity '' between both nations was postulated . 
  thus , the sympathies and the support of the majority of the greek public for the \u201e serbian side \u201f during the 1990s , which became evident especially in the huge amount of humanitarian aid from greece to serbia and the serbian population in bosnia and croatia , were interpreted as `` historically determined '' and `` natural '' . 
  as a striking example , the visit of radovan karad\u0163i\u0107 to greece in 1993 epitomises the idea of a traditional friendship connecting two `` brotherly orthodox nations that have always fought together on the same side '' -- a discourse that is still evident and widely spread in the internet and among greek-serbian friendship circles . 
  at this time an outcast in western europe , the greek orthodox church invited the leader of the bosnian serbs to athens , where he was warmly welcomed in the piraeus stadium by a huge audience , among them prominent political dignitaries . 
  on the occasion of this visit , he made a statement that became a dictum : `` everybody is telling us to lay down our arms because we are alone . 
  we say no , we are not alone . 
  we have with us god and the greeks ! `` the discourse of the `` greek-serbian friendship '' is embedded in larger debates about the logic of friendship and enmity , group building processes and media techniques to emotionalize public opinion . 
  therefore , ideas , rhetorical strategies and protagonists have to be placed in their social and cultural contexts in order to identify how these contexts relate to the circumstances of their emergence , their inner dynamics and their respective mutual influences . 
  hence , the `` greek-serbian friendship '' in the 90s has to be examined within the context of the end of the cold war and the breakup of the old state system . 
  this period did not only mark the beginning of a transition process in the former socialist states , but also in greece . 
  the turmoil on the greek northern border , the fall of the iron curtain and the collapse of yugoslavia in the 1990s , witnessed a reheated outbreak of scenarios of threat to the established geopolitical order and fear of instability that were triggered in the public discourse in greece . 
  against this background , milo\u0161evi\u0107 \u201f s serbia served as a projection screen for the social and emotional insecurities and anxieties of a majority of the greek public . 
  being the biggest and most influential yugoslav republic , it was imagined as a guarantor for stability on the northern border , someone reliable and well-disposed to the `` greeks '' , thus narratives of the `` brotherly serbian nation '' that were prominent at different periods of time , were reactivated . 
  a wide range of greek citizens united especially around the image of the serbian leader slobodan milo\u0161evi\u0107 , reaching from the extremist right with a pronounced orthodox nationalist attitude to the extremist anti-american orientated left . 
  in the imagination of both parties , `` the serbs were fighting our battle '' . 
  in the eyes of the former , the `` serbs '' were defending orthodoxy against `` the muslims '' in the bosnian war , in a kind of remake of the battles against the ottomans . 
  in the eyes of the latter , milo\u0161evi\u0107 as a socialist was resisting the `` western imperialists and capitalists '' . 
  it is important to point out that in this context the term `` friendship '' is not considered as a socio-psychological concept , but rather as a rhetorical attempt or a discursive praxis that aims at conferring stability and continuity to the political upswings and downswings of the relations between two actors . 
  what lies beneath , is the guiding idea that a `` traditional , historically conditioned and everlasting friendship '' between nations does not exist , but only fragments of discourses that are reactivated and newly composed at certain times , in certain contexts , by certain actors and for certain reasons . 
  the `` greek-serbian friendship '' in the 1990s is a striking example of creating a selective image of history and affiliation through rhetorical strategies based on the `` emotional '' in order to construct a historical continuity that is interpreted as `` traditional `` . 
  many people in this subreddit have asked how is it possible for the news media to be so corrupted here in greece . 
  this reuters report from december says it decent enough . 
  i would like to ask , what is your country 's opinion on greek media and what is the level of state control/involvement in media at your country ? 
  sorry for article repost , i just wanted you to see how the situation in greek media is and compare it with your country sry new redditor , here is the post http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/17/us-greece-media-idusbre8bg0cf20121217, 
  http://www.tovima.gr/en/article/?aid=510920 http://youtu.be/yfm1dkamuiy, 
  politics are retarded my friend , fyrom is not a name but a reference for a name , until a solution accepted from both sides is agreed . 
  the acronym fyrom ( former yugoslavic republic of macedonia ) logic is basically similar with the logic of the naming of tafkap ( `` the artist formerly known as prince '' ) for me its the same if you call it macedonia , upper macedonia , kebab or kermit ... the only ones that are getting stronger by this dispute are the far-right extremists in both countries and the merchants of memorabilia for alexander the great . 
  well , where i come from we call it informally skopje , taken from the state 's capital . 
  for formal use the acronym fyrom is widespread .
