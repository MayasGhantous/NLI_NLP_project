  and if it is n't any of the former , it 's omission/involuntary bias resulting from lack of time : the news outlet must put out the news before anyone else , if it wants views and money . 
  you can not ` win ' . 
  kudos to journalists and ` soft ' sciences types , i could never stand this constant flux and imperfection . 
  nah , it 's more like a natural personal tendency of not taking any human being , past , present and future , to his word . 
  i get disappointed less and avoid risk . 
  or there might not be such a law that words equal intentions , and that is valid for mandela as is valid for every single human being . 
  as a pessimist , i would say that we should n't make statues out of people at all , because everyone , sometime , somewhere , was an asshole . 
  it does n't matter if you know , they do . 
  considering that leaders rarely state what they actually think , there is no way to determine objectively what is speculation and what is not in that case . 
  it is n't ` hard ' science . 
  i think the chancellor conveniently ignores the possibility that nelson mandela might have accepted the scholarship under the ` take the money now , fuck the system from the inside later ' * principle . 
  in which case , the students truly follow his example . 
  state-owned media is a good failsafe against influence from private financial or foreign government interests . 
  i would n't want them to disappear completely . 
  hell , if our recent referendum has showed anything , is that literally every single one of our private stations distorted the polls for the ` yes ' vote . 
  and there are people who still believe that the media is not the fourth estate . 
  it 's idiotic to burn your own state media , when there are countries that do n't hesitate morally to broadcast their propaganda out and inside your country ( rt , rfe/rfl , e.t.c. ) . 
  it 's warfare on a media level , and honestly , i am disappointed that the european union does n't have an effective propaganda station of its own , instead always having to rely on the us-run rfe/rfl . 
  ( unless the eu is a puppet project of the us , and i have n't received the memo ) . 
  successful confrontation does n't make much impact to you , what can i say . 
  they are free to ignore that advice , because this is a society of free-willing people , not the fucking army . 
  the police confronts the intolerance of muslim culture pretty good . 
  nothing happened to europe . 
  lock up the few shitheads who do this . 
  they will adapt , or learn the hard way . 
  no need for pseudosociological crap theories about ` what happened to europe ' . 
  with respect to your two friends , two does n't describe the whole . 
  encouraging the fleeing will only make things worse . 
  far-right antisemitists win from this . 
  got ta maintain the * status quo * of the world 's industrial area , if we want our iphone cheap . 
  pesky human rights for chinese natives get in the middle of it , would n't want them getting self-aware and demanding better wages . 
  keep your cancer on 4chan . 
  i see that the news narrative in this subreddit is `` evolving '' . 
  france 's chief rabbi who opposed this kind of defeatist attitude ( and arguably , superior to a local teacher leader ) is n't even mentioned now . 
  whoever pushes these news is trying to actively scare the french jewish population , imho . 
  i am pretty sure that they could n't bring a house or a car with them across the aegean in the first place , you may want to pick examples that make logistical sense . 
  the businessman is trying to give them hands-on experience in a simulation , before it is too late . 
  what kind of paranoid theory of indirect responsibility is this ? 
  i despise stalin , but saying that he is responsible for dead soldiers and civilians killed by the nazis , is like saying the police is responsible for any murder that is happening . 
  would you blame churchill or roosevelt for uk 's or usa 's dead too ? 
  good on the rabbi , shame on the teacher . 
  defeatism just allows the shitheads an easy win . 
   space defense program putin trying to pull off a reagan , lol .

   ^ ( * nobody tell ryanair a god damn thing . ), 
  because you watched a show in english , catering to an english-speaking audience . 
  it would be weird , costly and difficult to follow if the producers had decided to cast non-english-spreaking actors and produce english subtitles for their screentime . 
  tl ; dr : it 's not you or a phenomenon , it 's the bias you get from the format of the show . 
  the title had a secondary false meaning to me : `` the situation in iran , after it established offices in europe '' . 
   that or my english need improvement . 
  you do n't even need parts in some cases . 
  there are blank revolvers that only have a small iron piece , welded inside the middle of the barrel , as protection . 
  you just need proper knowledge and a lathe to remove the piece , rifle the barrel and turn the gun into a normal revolver .

  who needs guns , when we can burn our forests to oblivion ? 
  having a global leviathan has its pros : you can not tax evade by fleeing with your capital to another country . 
  that political unification is of course bad news for pump-and-dump businessmen . 
  do n't mind me , just dropping some evil , federalist , unifying food for thought , instead of bickering about the way by neighbor should treat its goat : * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_super_grid * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_sea_offshore_grid * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/isles_project, 
  it 's really sad that we have to resolve on unearthing cold war events to make our present selves appear good . 
  there is no easy commie scapegoat to blame anymore . 
  man the fuck up . 
  you too . 
  i do n't have much experience with germanic languages , so i ca n't tell you .

  poor areas . 
  more like ` secular countries that stick the finger to the church ' vs ` countries where the politicians submit to the blackmail of the church ' . 
  it 's pseudocode . 
  if ` security of nation ' | | ` security of union ' = true then give ( life ) ; logic of collective security checks out . 
  i try to say that it is a good start , but not enough . 
  i prefer to skip pretext , and go straight for the bullshit . 
  it 's what makes economies go round . 
  a student builds his bio with a non-issue , the institution gets pr , nationalists consolidate as the opposing force . 
  a game where everyone wins except society . 
  it 's like observing a symbiotic relationship of parasites . 
  never send an artist to do a lawyer 's work . 
  unfortunately no . 
  because someone has 1 ) to pay the countries that keep them offshore 2 ) the countries/barriers must be willing to take the burden and keep them offshore for you . 
  isolationism does n't work , it 's just a pretext for avoiding competition . 
  it 's state capitalism . 
  the state gives employment to teachers . 
  the teachers did n't formed a commune by themselves , so it is n't socialism . 
   btw , since mastercard bought ec , they 've been trying to force companies to accept credit cards , too , and increased the fees . 
  why are we taking our news from a malaysian website ? 
  where people see a disaster , others see an opportunity . 
  capitalism , fuck yeah !, 
  i tend to skip ethics and words and follow the money , it just comes natural after years in a monetary crisis . 
  political science newsflash : you can not live a comfortable civilized european life , if the peripheral country that supports you or acts as a barrier goes to shit . 
  you do n't exist in a vacuum . 
  any type of ethical argument is hypocritical , because it does n't frame the issue in its real basis . 
  it 's not hard to observe that framing the issue around the very existence of the scholarship is not monetarily beneficial to any of the involved sides ( student , university , supporters of rhodes ' nationalistic/colonialist legacy ) .
