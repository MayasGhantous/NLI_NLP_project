  russia warns western diplomats not to fuck with ukraine and it 's russian-friendly government . 
  us hawks decide to fuck with established spheres of influence anyways . 
  also , '' [ fuck the eu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/victoria_nuland#leaked_phone_conversation ) '' ( apparently because they do n't want to have any fucking part in the classic imperial-building tactic `` external enemy/new territories as distraction from internal problems '' ) . 
  `` omfg , i ca n't believe russia materialized their threat . 
  reeee . '', 
  i do not know if corsica has laws that override national ones , but iirc in france you are n't legally allowed to take a photo of someone without her or his permission , burkini or not . 
  probably the most butthurt government in current existence . 
  here 's one reason i can think of : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:orthodoxy_by_country.svg, 
  yes , paranoid , exclusionary and undemocratic . 
  after the end of the civil war in 1949 and up until 1967 , the greek state , with the help of the allies , excluded from public life everyone suspected having `` communist '' tendencies , meaning anyone ranging from communist to social democrat . 
  it is you who needs to do some reading , and not just the parts that are convenient to your biased narrative . 
  what putin does is n't an excuse for other countries to do the same shit . 
  a paranoid perception of subversion , which ended up not being supported by historical documents . 
  and before that , a deep right-wing state , excluding from public life democratic people and ` evil commies ' alike . 
  freedom like this ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_military_junta_of_1967%e2%80%9374 maybe , just maybe , it is westerners who actually remember what `` freedom '' means , unlike the whitewashed propaganda version that you like to be fed . 
  also they do n't defend putin , but rather criticize what is a distraction from internal problems , by using an external enemy as a scapegoat . 
  whether this distraction is russia or ` dem turrorists ' . 
  itt : people not realizing that it 's a new kind of nationalism , eu nationalism , vs the old-style nationalism . 
  and once established , as dangerous as the us , ussr or prc nationalism . 
  that 's why nato never shares 100 % the same information that the core countries have with the peripheral ones . 
  there are layers of information sharing . 
  they are n't idiots , they have learned from similar geopolitical shifts in the past . 
  the peripheral countries will always be susceptible to the pressure , propaganda and disinformation of the middle east and russia . 
  maybe start from here and look at the sources then , since of course i , an anonymous person on the internet , have no credibility : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war#theories_for_motivation, 
  yes , because for the matter to come into military escalation , it means someone in diplomacy fucked up . 
   they probably ** teach ** people ** to ** rise in the system and embezzle some funds later . 
  ftfy, 
  no , because i do n't have money aside to burn at rent , food and housing while i work for free . 
  neither a daddy or mommy able to pay for my adventure . 
  on * the other hand , i am pretty happy that people have n't resorted completely to idiotic militarism , as a venue of escape for economic problems . 
  no one deserves to die for the money of big banks and businesses . 
  if you are a boss ? 
  definitely . 
  i am pretty sure that the gulf states , and more generally , islamic states are doing their part in this global , supposedly united nations issue : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/refugees_of_the_syrian_civil_war how about not deflecting our own responsibility in the issue ? 
  * i do n't see a separation of left and right-wing in that graph . 
  * i guess if you do the killing and torturing of civilians in a western-backed or - tolerated dictatorship by the thousands , it does n't count as `` immoral terrorism '' and does n't make it into the graph . 
  graphs and infographics , the new way to do lies after statistics ( tm ) . 
  we do n't have that right . 
  it 's actually a heated debate in the parliament at the moment , because they are amending the voting law . 
  the government wants to allow 17-year olds to vote as well as turn the system into fully proportional , but they do n't want to allow vote-by-mail ( probably because their requested polls show that the opposition will profit from it ) . 
  renovation and maintenance is n't free . 
   you do n't burn down the plantation when you do n't like the slaves ftfy, 
  you can not properly establish bias if anonymity is used . 
  the author , their agenda and her/his past opinions matter . 
  the economist hides their bias because they write all their articles anonymously , under the guise of `` tradition '' . 
  ( edit : syntax correction ), 
  instead , the only rational ^ \u00a9 recipe for a growth economy is to demolish whatever still barely lives , without putting something in its place . 
  i am not much into glass and metal monstrosities . 
  a rebuilt neoclassical city would be much better aesthetically . 
  ah yes , the big scary kremlin boogeyman . 
  as if the incompetent establishment of the union and of the individual countries does n't do a perfectly fine job breaking up the union themselves . 
  legality changes according to a society 's morals . 
  whoever says that the law is immovable and discourages any change , is most likely profiting off the legal status quo . 
  please tell me how evil sweden controls predominantly epp-dominated europe . 
  europe politically and economically is controlled by right-wing parties , and the response to that was even more right-wing parties . 
  if you wanted to paint the aggressors as victims , you failed spectacularly . 
  except when you go after the easy and safe speck of sawdust , when there is a hard and dangerous beam to hunt down . 
  then you diminish the crimes yourself . 
  if a drug dealer has sold you a drug 30 years ago that was legal back then , but in the meantime it was made illegal ( cluster treaty 2008 ) and you kill someone today ( yemeni civil war 2015-now ) with it , who 's fault is this ? 
  the original drug dealer 's or yours ? 
  talking about major buck passing . 
  `` the saudis ca n't do no wrong , they are no-knowing-better indigenous people who just drop clusters from jets . 
  it 's the fault of the evil colonialist brits again '' . 
  do you think that yemen or saudi arabia will ever man up to their responsibilities and care for their own citizens , with this kind of twisted thinking ? 
   continue selling to the person who is slaughtering people except they do n't sell cluster munitions anymore . 
  this particular ammunition that amnesty international found is dated from the 70s according to the article , long before the cluster treaty got in effect ( 2008 ) and long before the war ( 2015 ) . 
  it is the fault of whoever currently owns the ammunition and chooses to use it instead of destroying it , and it is a 100 % clean responsibility . 
  the yemen war started in 2015 . 
  these weapons were manufactured in the 70s . 
  unless the brits are god damn oracles , a ) they could n't predict back then that the weapons * would be used this way and b ) the cluster munitions treaty was n't even in effect . 
   what 's `` extreme right wing '' to you ? 
  ethnic `` purity '' is a good place to start . 
  in this regard the far-right everywhere want the same thing : a homogenized nation-state `` clean '' from other ethnicities or where other ethnicities are b class citizens , only allowed to serve the a class . 
  in the case of the ultra-nationalist israeli government , pesky human rights treaties and international observers hold the `` progress '' back . 
  apparently you have no knowledge of diplomacy and west-israel politics est. 
  israel always played the populist christian right in their favor and always combated `` liberals '' in universities opposing their apartheid-like policies . 
  in the israeli-palestinian conflict , the side opposite to the one of haaretz 's has learned to use the best weapon : the pen . 
  hard evidence like camera recordings from army and police brutality , public discourse and activism . 
  the israeli government of course does n't like it one bit , so they do stuff like that : try to discredit the `` mind '' that operates the pen . 
  in a level more serious than a twitter activist , they do this in university politics at the other side of the pond : iirc two jewish university professors lost their tenure for daring to criticize the israeli government . 
  this apparent alliance of the israeli government with the far-right in europe is opportunistic and short-lived . 
  they support anti-right activists in europe because combating racism is of course a common goal in both societies . 
  just not the anti-right muslim activists that use the subsequently gained social capital as a weapon against them . 
  the enemy of my enemy is my friend , and all that jazz . 
  in our referendum , employers were * threatening employees that if the `` no '' was to win , the business would close and they would be left jobless . 
  psychological blackmail in favor of `` yes '' . 
  some employers tried to save the day by claiming that they were `` joking '' . 
  conservation of money  conservation of everything else . 
  this is a propaganda video by a radical organization ( look up hizb ut-tahrir ) . 
  edit : got downvoted in an instant after posting this comment . 
  what 's up op , are you here on a mission to provocate ? 
  it is an isis propaganda video . 
  yeah , * sure * . 
  i am not the one who 's top comment is a dog-whistle marking the subject as guilty , under the pretext of ` explaining the situation ' . 
  if this guy was in ` enemy ' russia and was charged by the state , everyone in here would have reflexively gotten to his side . 
  flex you war cocks boys , it 's double justice standard time . 
  that 's what the prosecutor says . 
  he is not yet convicted of anything . 
  when did irrelevance stop political persecution ?
