  so as a citizen of a eu country , you wo n't be able to travel between eu countries without first showing your passport to the agents , unless you are military , in which case the pesky civie agents have to let you through no questions asked . 
  service guarantees citizenship , would you like to know more ? 
  what a nice liberal democratic union the right-wing hardliners slowly want us to turn into . 
  very questionable if it is the same threat as in the cold war days , and anyway , that does n't justify no one to turn everything into propaganda 24/7 in a neutral subreddit . 
  get your own / r/rightwingloonies subreddit if you want to jerk off your warhawk so hard . 
  and you are not a `` moron on here '' , just from the other side , because ... ? 
  also and in more general terms , we call morons here and there , a `` democracy '' . 
  the `` morons '' of the other side have every right to use their vote to stop you and any other `` moron '' , on this . 
  we do n't trust them because of their `` solution '' they * force * through blackmailing to cut off the mechanical support we need ( since we still are unable to normally get loans from the markets ) . 
   socialist bullshitters da comrade , it is well known that before the crisis we had a people 's revolution that seized all the means of production . 
  it was n't real capitalism ^ ( tm ) . 
  my doctor saved the scratch on my leg , by chopping my entire leg off . 
  10/10 , would recommend his private practice again . 
  it 's a slur for the failures of `` pro-free market '' reformers and it is global , not us imported . 
  it absolutely makes sense in europe , since we have tons of parties being pro-market reform , some of them long-dominant and in government . 
  i think the `` wait ... '' was ironical . 
  pretty sure that white supremacists and nazis are one and the same in the `` hatred and extermination of non-whites '' department . 
  stephen miller in the present does n't have the same motivation . 
  it does n't have the `` common hatred '' element he mentioned , but it does have the `` same nation as the intended targets '' element he mentioned ( stephen miller being jewish ) . 
  much more absurd and interesting to study than just pointing an example of the many non-jewish collaborators of the nazis , who did n't only have opportunism as their motive . 
  jewish ghetto police is a much closer case : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jewish_ghetto_police, 
  neither elstat or eurostat made the aformentioned law , which is essentially an implementation of the eu-imf imposed programmes . 
  can we get a single day in this subreddit that we do n't use every other only superficially political post , as a platform to stick it to the `` evil russkies '' , red scare revival style ? 
  you people have become super predictable and boring . 
  we talk about it alright , just in a way that not everyone likes ( one of the tax heavens of europe ) . 
  they might not have official nation-state power to prevent you , but their people will most definitely create a new wave of terrorists , as payback to your power-tripping . 
  people here are most definitely predisposed to hate ngos and throw around every bit of dirt against them whenever and wherever they find it , because the ngos ' humanitarian work is an obstacle to their `` vision '' of using the official state power to `` protect the west from the ` invaders ' '' . 
  aka , throw every western value out the window , drown them before they reach the shores , bully in a colonial fashion foreign weak countries to pay or take care of the problem , e.t.c. 
  it is organized , not just a circumstantial hate bandwagon . 
  `` facilitating mass immigration '' , the newspeak way of `` we ca n't get your for being a decent human being that upholds our very own values regardless of our obsession over money and tribal-like racism , so we get you in legalese '' . 
  behold , our supposed western moral advantage over dictatorships . 
  in the context of processing refugees from war zones , middle eastern countries surrounding syria have taken loads more than the entire west , eu and us , combined . 
  non-alternative , inconvenient fact . 
  who says it * still * is n't right-wing crazies throwing dirt at ngos , just because the mission of the latter goes against the nationalist gated community vision they have for europe ? 
  oh , that 's right , the very same agenda-pushing crazies . 
  the suffering is created by the insistence of people being liberal with freedom ^ ( tm ) exporting , but conservative when it comes to paying for the blowback of the exporting . 
  not by msf or any other not being a psycho or voting for psychos . 
  seems pretty dishonest to frame this as an `` eu ( directly electable democratic parliament + undemocratic/indirectly electable commission + totally undemocratic central bank ) vs democratic parliaments + governments '' question . 
  either have it the same ( eu parliaments vs national parliaments ) or have `` more '' to counterbalance on the `` national side '' , e.g. 
  trust in the national central banks . 
  `` we will make stazi look like a fucking kindergarden . '', 
  -- post-cold war western intelligence services , apparently, 
  macron is good for france alright , the problem is he is good for only the 1 % of france . 
  same goes for your favorite lepen : just the typical history textbook fascist/bad cop , when the good cop/macron shit does n't fly anymore . 
   solidarity when it comes to shoving migrants down e. europe 's throat . 
  ... as opposed to shoving migrants down the countries ' of entry throats . 
  the wrong is that using force is justified against threats . 
  refugees are n't threats . 
  because that 's not how pragmatically protecting borders works . 
  the inevitable result of most countries being isolationist and unwilling to pragmatically , not just as a nice gesture , share the burden . 
  by the way , that 's nothing compared to what the immediate neighbors of syria have gotten . 
  poland gets the same hate that every other isolationist/pro-fortress-policy government gets . 
  most people still love migrants . 
  it 's the shitheads who have forced their way more into mainstream and also the result of conservatives trying to appease them/keep them as voters . 
  they were vocal since the very start . 
  except the guy in the second picture , depicting the government , is not the same one that put up the fence . 
  next thing you 'll tell me is that we , here in the free world , live in glorified oligarchies , not democracies of the ideal , direct type . 
  it keeps the temporarily embarrassed millionaires under control of the true millionaires . 
  i wonder if supposedly sovereign and free afghanistan will accept them , as is international law ... oh wait , we are the effective government over there too , under force of guns . 
  of course they say ` yes ' to everything . 
  colonialism : most definitely not dead , just whitewashed 24/7 from the media as ` caring for freedom ' and other bs . 
  the stated part of the reforms is that , the implemented one is to leave the biggest fishes get away while their burden is placed upon the innocents . 
  and to slash the functional parts of the state , not the crony ones . 
   you litteraly swam in uk/france/germany 's money for 30 years and you want me to pity you for 5 years of austerity and reform ? 
  * i * swam or a top e.g. 
  do you know what ` distribution ' means or you only see money in terms of absolute amounts flowing ? 
   and what did we just do ? 
  we just kicked out every single politician that was working the last 5 years . 
  but you ca n't ? 
  that 's pathetic to keep putting on other 's your fault . 
  grow a pair . 
  the elite is n't only the politician-figurehead . 
  you kicked out nothing by voting in a banker , financier and member of the old system . 
  it 's the exact same way , that you desperately try to brand in a professional liar/marketer way , as ` new ' and ` fresh ' . 
  what ** you ** do n't understand is that when i and a million others have done our part and even more , we are not anymore responsible to bear the weight of those who continue to charge everyone for their expensive lifestyle . 
  democracy has its limits when it comes to money . 
  i ca n't vote out the elite circle which has to pay its past wrongdoings , if it wants to see the country back on its feet . 
  they have the most money , they have the most responsibility . 
  that 's actual balance : proportionality . 
  my personal account is balanced , i never took any loan i did n't repay , i keep all my money here to be taxed and i was n't in debt until some fine rich gentlemen asked me to pay for them too . 
  yes , * most definitely * is not my fault , and i have the evidence to support it . 
  what about you and your buddies ? 
  tell that to your non-vulnerable buddies getting their banks bailed out on public dime , the businessmen getting generous subsidies and every elite hoarding otherwise-productive and taxable wealth in tax heavens . 
  vulnerable people are n't in fault for the dirt of the cronies that you prop up through the policies that you support . 
  ... so judging by the effects of the policy you support , you equate the state to be the vulnerable people getting shafted , not the well-off business and financial interests profiting from its subsidies and cronyism . 
  restoration of trust seems to be dependent on whether any government accepts to brutalize the most vulnerable and firesale public property . 
  [ hollande . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/10/francois-hollande-pushes-through-labour-bill-with-special-decree ), 
  they made a ton of labour law adjustments favoring business at the expense of workers , before that . 
  the visa is the newest cherry on the top . 
  sure , please tell me how the things the previous governments were doing were * totally * different than what supposedly new banker and business executive macron is doing . 
  * illusion * of change . 
  it 's the worldwide dominant dogma . 
  if only formalities and bureaucrat-level participations in institutions made the base ( the people ) support something ... 
  so just a repeat of `` business owners first , employees might as well die '' dogma that has gone from bad to worse . 
  i wonder how this will play out for the nth time . 
  i prefer [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/gxrnenqyg7i?t=300 ) , it suits more the type of people i have seen uttering it . 
  they are perfectly free to develop a weedkiller or pesticide which keeps food security without negative consequences . 
  the ` truth of the matter ' is that they do n't care to do that , instead they try to go the bribe/lobbying way . 
  fucking us up .
