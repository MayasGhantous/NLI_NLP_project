  if no receipt , take what you were given and leave . 
  if they resist taking it , leave anyway , time and goods wasted for the business . 
  greece : * santorini island blackout , local electricity production plant failed . 
  shop owners plan to sue the national electrical company . 
  * passenger dies , fell off the bus after a brawl with the conductor . 
  shitstorm about people dying due to strict ticket checking practices enforced because of austerity measures . 
  your country is balls . 
  ice-frozen vodka . 
  do n't carry $ 10k cash on you . 
  greece : most people live in cities , so a typical residence building looks like this : http://imgur.com/gzjw3m8, 
  olympics should n't be tied to politics . 
  the spirit of the ancient games was for city-states to put aside differences , stop all wars and participate in the games to strengthen ties . 
  boycotts are unacceptable , no matter the issue . 
  they try to use the games as political leverage . 
  it will have the effect of further alienating russia from the rest of the world . 
  gay rights wo n't get better if the russian people perceive that they are tied to foreign interests . 
  change comes from within and the other countries should stop interfering ; russia is a sovereign state . 
  prism had deals with the eu countries ' intelligence agencies , to provide data to it . 
  us and eu countries are together in the scandal , only the uninformed believe that the eu is innocent . 
  us would n't be able to touch a email between greece and germany , if it was n't for the cooperation of both greece and germany ( which it was ) . 
  what no politician in every part of the world does n't understand , or pretends to not understand , is that you can not regulate the internet unilaterally as a country . 
  laws with international reach and a body with the authority to enforce them are necessary . 
  we should push our politicians to start discussing international treaties and an actual enforcement of them on the un level . 
  honestly , i do n't see a solution to this problem except of that of a world government . 
  that 's good . 
  german data law spectacularly failed to prevent `` friendly cooperation '' between germany 's intelligence agency and the us prism program . 
  why should the eu shape it 's data protection system based on a failed system ? 
  filters are a good thing , but the `` default-on '' way of implementing them is wrong . 
  isps should implement filters , be obligated to inform the parents when they sign the connection contract and in regular time periods that such filters exist , and do everything in their power to assist the parents if they want to activate the filters . 
  but banning everything from the start , making the system opt-out ? 
  i suppose it 's being done because nobody in their right mind would report themselves as an illegal immigrant to an official , even if it 's the country 's statistical authority . 
  you are a savage and you paint the rest of us in bad light . 
  it 's his right to receive a fair trial . 
  also the last time we executed someone was during the fucking dictatorship . 
  it 's irrelevant who is the head of government . 
  they want you to believe it 's relevant so that you think that things can change simply if you change the head . 
  from the french revolution till today , every country in the western world is run by big capital . 
  the big capital took the power from the royal nobility . 
  no historian denies that . 
  and all this play that our eu leaders pull off , complaining about you guys spying us , is just a pretext so we the eu citizens can feel vindicated that our leaders have balls . 
  when the next war starts , we will bury every difference and share the sweet black oil of a poor middle eastern or african country together . 
  then wonder why they hate us and keep suicide-bombing us . 
  then play the good samaritans by sending humanitarian help . 
  retreat , rinse and repeat . 
  * the west is the best ... *, 
  their dark beer is damn good .

  dae get a feeling that he does n't believe what he says ? 
  his language tone is pompous . 
  i think / r/newreddits is better for that , you get to know subreddits before they even have content . 
  disadvantage is that it is n't automatic , if nobody promotes their subreddit there you ca n't know about it . 
  there should be a new subreddits ' feed instead of the function you describe . 
  i already have 4chan 's / int / if i want shit threads with loaded titles . 
  let 's not turn / r/europe into the same direction , shall we ? 
  pol pot was close to the dream . 
  north korea is yet to catch up . 
  everything is easier if you are giving advice for someone else 's property . 
  i will ask the mods about it . 
  this is what i see : http://imgur.com/xpnydrf, 
  the wikipedia article does a good job on explaining the past and current situation : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antisemitism_in_greece, 
  i thought it was a world-wide thing , no ? 
  do n't delete your comments and then claim things you did n't write . 
  you characterized him as `` lukewarm '' and `` mainstream '' , things that he obviously is n't , no matter which one of the three sources you choose to trust . 
  it had to be done because he tried to sell him as a down-to-earth person . 
  linking to contrarian sites demonstrating that he is regarded as a conspiracy theorist even by them , was the fastest and most direct way to disprove it . 
  i had to verify with conservapedia , just for you . 
  nope , still conspiracy theorist : http://www.conservapedia.com/alex_jones, 
  diverse yugoslavia was doing pretty good , until they decided for some reason that apart is better . 
  it 's as if nationalism is an autoimmune disease . 
  the moment it gets in you , you start bashing the heads of former friends in , for ` honour ' and ` purity ' of the race/nation . 
  i would rather have no ` honour ' , than this shit . 
  fun shameful historical fact : some members of our far-right golden dawn party participated in the srebrenica massacre . 
  it 's always funny to witness bullies trying to paint themselves as victims . 
  nonsense . 
  / r/anormaldayinrussia is an accurate picture of your country , you are just a putin shill . 
  warning to fellow europeans : alex jones is a far right conspiracy nutter . 
  #lentil - tomato ( or `` red '' lentil ) soup ## ingredients * 300 grams lentils * 2 medium-sized dry onions , finely diced * 3 garlic cloves , finely diced * 2 matured tomatoes * 1 tablespoon tomato paste ( ~ 10 ml ) * 3/4 tea cup olive oil ( ~ 143 ml ) * 2 laurel leaves * 2 tablespoons vinegar * 1/4 sweet-spoon sugar ( ~ 1 g ) * 1/2 sweet-spoon oregano ( ~ 1 g ) * salt & pepper ## execution 1 . 
  peel and grind the tomatoes . 
  boil the lentils in a pot filled with water that barely covers them , for 5 ' ( from the moment the mix starts boiling ) . 
  strain them , wash them and discard the water . 
  in a pot at medium heat : saut\u00e9 the onions and garlic with the olive oil , until transparent . 
  add the lentils and continue saut\u00e9ing for another 3 ' . 
  add tomato paste , grind tomatoes , laurel leaves , sugar , oregano , salt , pepper and cold water , so the height difference is 2 -- 3 fingers ( 2 -- 3 cm ) above the previous mix . 
  mix again . 
  cover the port and boil at low heat , stirring frequently so the mix does n't stick to the bottom and burns up . 
  if necessary to prevent this , add water . 
  the resulting mix should have an appearance close to hummus , but not totally uniform . 
  it should absorb all the excess watery liquid but at the same time it should be soft , i.e. 
  ` done ' , not ` raw ' . 
  towards the end of the boil , add vinegar . 
  ## serving serves 4 persons . 
  accompany with raw salad or olives .

  if this is a gamble , does this make us the house ? 
  also , congrats on the cheesy reiteration of if , it is in high demand after the recent mission impossible film . 
  i have just one question for you ... are you ready ? 
  what a load of b. 
  from all the parties that managed to get in parliament , they have probably the most uncorrupted politicians and voters , without going to the retarded nazi extreme of golden dawn . 
  my doubts are if they are competent .
