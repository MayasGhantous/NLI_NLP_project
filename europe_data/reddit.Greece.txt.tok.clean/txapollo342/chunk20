  reddit does n't love monsanto , * public relations managers * being foreign bodies to its community do . 
  we should n't bash the people who are affected by them . 
  just providing a counter-example to the claim that everything can be decided without taking into regard the public 's opinion . 
  was n't interested in the details . 
  if it is n't body bags , in may be another thing that makes initially favorable public opinion to swing and thus have decisions cancelled . 
  a decision not being made by polls does n't mean it is 100 % certain to end by a decision not being made by polls . 
  [ non-interventionism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-interventionism ) does n't mean [ anti-americanism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-americanism ) ( or [ anti-europeanism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-europeanism ) , for the novel variant of ` support our troops or you are a traitor ' bullshit our own warhawkish elite pushes ) . 
  also not all are old established interests , benefiting from the maintenance of how things are . 
  we open our hearts and bring * refugees * in need , who * happen * to be muslim . 
   they are good people , they do not force anyone to convert to islam . 
  they definitely like lgbt people . 
  our own brand of neonazis do n't mean to force anyone when they hit refugees , immigrants and their supporters , or lgbt people . 
  it 's merely free speech for god and mein kampf . 
  reality is n't pleasant . 
  reality is n't also worse than `` reality '' . 
  `` elimination of massive mountains of bureaucracy for all '' is nothing but a pro-business rhetoric . 
  what they actually do when in power is to push all the bureaucracy to the common folk . 
  same with taxes : they cut only the business ones , with common folk having to bear more of the burden . 
  just because they were n't in a government with their own distinct party does n't mean they are n't inside every `` non-pro-business '' party , pushing their agenda . 
  yeah , everything is going great for eu cohesion with pro-business liberals getting their way . 
  source : brexit , rise of far-right and far-left everywhere . 
   to me , what leaves me bitter is that is seems their release of sensitive docs are always hitting one side . 
  maybe only one side is careless enough ? 
  the ugly truth is that right-wingers and right-wingers-with-left-disguise everywhere cheer when their profitable business of dropping bombs on the countries of origin thrives , but do n't want anything to do with the unprofitable collateral/refugee consequences : that 's for the suckers/most neighboring countries to burden . 
  i am pretty sure that genociding a whole civilization is n't fair punishment for it practicing human sacrifice , as you imply . 
  in economics as well as in hawkish foreign policy , tories and labour-blairites have become identical . 
  makes absolute sense to vote for labour under corbyn , now that the blairites have been marginalized . 
  it 's a reduction from $ 1.01 / mb to $ 0.0092 / mb , which converts to a reduction from $ 1.13 / mb to $ 0.010 / mb . 
  just their time-honored tradition of trying to shoehorn their way into current cultural trends . 
  time for a [ nazi punks fuck off ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nazi_punks_fuck_off ) for the current age . 
   sure , but according to the narrative us is a dictatorship , while turkey is a free democratic country just with a bit too strong erdogan . 
  just because someone `` won '' the race to dictatorshipland first , does n't mean others do n't run the same race . 
   evidence-based policies right-wing policies whose predictions the evidence themselves have brutally ridiculed , iteration after iteration , but you still insist that they are evidence-based ? 
   i could just demand and my fantasies would materialise like magic . 
  nothing like that , just mildly social democratic pragmatic policies , the ones that so called social democrats have abandoned in favor of being the paneuropean conservatives ' sidekicks . 
  `` best legacy of thatcher '' indeed . 
  you ca n't grow an economy when you treat the workers like shit , causing them to immigrate . 
  have fun trying to find skilled workers as an le enlightened macron - or new democracy-voting employer , if no one sticks around . 
  how about `` problem not solved , because pragmatically no mildly leftist policy of our platform was allowed to be implemented by our european central bank and international monetary fund overlords '' ? 
  you can play dumb and pretend that external powers do n't impose their will , all you like . 
  so he is n't a liberal , but the most classic conservative one can find . 
  `` true colours '' means he pretends to be a liberal up until he clarifies what type of liberty he wants : for the workers or for the employers ? 
  syriza and generally any left-wing party ca n't improve a nation 's situation solely by its own actions , when it is virtually extorted with instant death of its nation , by the right-wing european institutions . 
  i guess you can be sadistically happy about that , as well as you local greek similarly-minded friends . 
  it suffices that he keeps dead silent when asked the relevant hard questions about what he is going to do with ` socialist ' structures and institutions . 
  `` it seems that the people do n't like it one bit that we neoliberals take away every ` socialist ' right they have ( free public healthcare , education , welfare . 
  ) , to the point of voting to crash this union with no survivors . 
  what should we do ? 
  `` double down on it . '', 
  -13 for daring to insult our corporate overlords . 
  nice . 
  neoliberals showing their true colours . 
  no surprise .

  fair exchange , if you ask me . 
  i admit that i am not informed about the entities described in the document . 
  just about the layers claim , from a yesterday 's reddit thread in which it was debunked . 
  some would say that the foreigner was above the law , so he was served with an executive decision . 
  * depardieu * roy jones jr * edward snowden yeah ... that last one is n't in the same category as the first two . 
  but nice way of putting everyone in the same category , to push the agenda that whistleblowers are the threat , instead of our own corrupt politicians that they expose . 
  goebbels 10/10 . 
  edit :  as kasparov said : '' it 's a standard propaganda ploy to troll the west and to deflect attention from the economic problems and lack of rights in putin 's dictatorship '' so is our own version of it . 
  the `` blame russia '' for every current problem we are facing , from austere economic policies to immigration , is very fucking real . 
  * your employer has n't paid you for months ? 
  suck it up , putin is at the gates !!,

  because le pen , trump or any other `` non-systemic '' candidate worldwide did n't have their own fair share of dirty laundry being exposed . 
  totally . 
  / s and i am using `` non-systemic '' in quotes because all of them prove to be the most systemic candidates , once they assume office . 
  so the fears about the whole western civilization collapsing on itself due to external interference , are merely a f.u.d. 
  tactic to scare people into remaining in the bipartisanship grinder . 
  what if you are n't a patriot , but just want tax-evading and tax-avoiding `` patriots '' like and around macron pay what salary they owe you , for months ? 
  -- dirty internationlist/globalist left-winger, 
  scanning a document by using ocr can have a non-merged pdf as a perfectly valid result . 
  it is n't any kind of proof of fakeness . 
  given that a candidate with no traditional big party backing and/or millions of euros/dollars/rubles / wans of backing from oligarcs , has no chance of ever holding office , the ` democracy of equality ' principle simply does n't exist . 
  are you a public official of the likes of macron , le pen , trump , hillary , putin , xiaoping , e.t.c. ? 
  then yes please , i most definitely want to see them . 
  you sign up for a position of power , you give up your ` common citizen ' privacy . 
  simple as that . 
  your average ` redirect the conversation to be about the whistleblower instead of the corrupt subject of the leaks ' is n't much better , either . 
  or ` redirect the conversation so as the people do n't notice that both candidates have identical right-wing economic policies , both fucking them over ' . 
  or all those definitely russkie western media organizations : https://wikileaks.org/-partners-.html / s, 
  itt : accounts losing their shit over supposed interference from the far-right , while they get hundreds of upvotes and support for their equally batshit stance that we should n't hold a candidate accountable for his corruption and antisocial stance , just because ` muh red scare whistleblower ' . 
  or about the actual policies of both sides , which are identical in fucking the poor and the middle class over . 
  being left-wing , wanting to maintain wages , pension , free public healthcare , education , welfare , e.t.c. ? 
  literally stalin , because you are n't falling for the ` lesser evil ' rhetoric of supporting the neolib macron fuckhead over the paternalist-danger le pen fuckhead . 
  or the neolib hillary fuckhead over the paternalist-danger trump fuckhead . 
  or every other right-wing neolib fuckhead against the right-wing paternalist-danger fuckhead , in every bipartisan electoral system , internationally . 
  it is n't about baggage , it is about having to legitimise either a neolib or a paternalist , who both intend to fuck healthcare , pensions , wages , education , unions , etc. 
  up , to court to their big business and banking supporters . 
  the only winning move is not to play . 
  conflating anyone wanting communist/socialist things like free public healthcare , education and welfare with wanting literally stalinist communism , also does n't work . 
  somewhere , a self-described `` liberal '' apple fanboy reads this on his `` designed in california , made in china '' device , circlejerking with others as being better than those ` le literally fascists ' .
