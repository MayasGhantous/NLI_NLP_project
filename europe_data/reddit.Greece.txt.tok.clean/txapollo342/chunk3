  syriza voters have the unique quality of being ex-pasok . 
  their holier-than-thou universe would implode if their leader agreed to cooperate . 
  perhaps they wonder why would you secretly talk to members of an extremist party , before imprisoning them . 
  ^ ( nowhere is safe from the baneposting . ), 
  this is n't a `` left '' vs `` right '' frame , it 's a `` corruption '' vs `` no-corruption '' frame . 
  you will be surprised if you study closer what type of politicians and voters left pasok and hijacked syriza , once it became apparent that the former started going against their interests . 
  same for smaller conservative parties . 
  they come from former nd . 
  and the situation is n't likely to get fixed , because the most energetic , uncorrupted and educated ( the young people ) do n't stay and try to fix the situation , but are constantly getting disappointed and keep immigrating abroad . 
  regardless if they lean towards the left or right . 
  and pol pot , you need a vessel to brew the stew in . 
  conveniently ignoring that the ` conservative ' 1990-1993 government increased the debt equally at half the time , by hiring their voters in the public sector and making deals with ` private endeavour ' businessmen . 
  in spirit and practice your typical conservative crony capitalism , with none of the petty ` left evil welfare ' excuses . 
  i did n't expect anything different than a one sided-analysis , to be honest . 
  it 's pretty apparent from the graph that there is no causation . 
  both ( pasok-papandreou ) and ( nd-mitsotakis ) appear to have skyrocketed the debt , and both tried to keep it in check ( pasok-papandreou , pasok-simitis and nd-karamanlis jr. ) . 
  if you were to establish a causation , it seems a more probable theory that joint eu-greece policy is to blame : that debt started skyrocketing once greece joined the eu , and went out of control with the global recession . 
  * ( but in every sunday lunch around an nd family table , you will hear how those dirty green and red socialists are to blame for every evil that has befallen this country , because our home-grown well-dressed republicans can never be wrong ) . 
  experience says that investors love their bipartisanship . 
  they do n't care which two parties are in power , as long as the situation is stable . 
  they will be more worried with syriza or nd not forming a majority government , rather than syriza itself . 
  it was a situation similar to syriza . 
  they governed for 5 years , the economy blew around 2009 , then they threw the hot potato to pasok and went into the background , to avoid impeachment . 
  only now it was a 7-month syriza government instead of a 2-year pasok one . 
  the more things change , the more they stay the same . 
  got ta love the way cowards and `` smart guys in the room '' operate . 
  they managed to throw the hot potato to pasok a little before it blew , and avoid impeachment till this day . 
  things will be a-ok for these smart guys in the room . 
  how to do flexible and realistic geopolitics , that will have a good end result for you : not .

  hmm ... something 's fishy . 
  good luck guarding that . 
  if conflict history has demonstrated anything , is that $ 10,000 worth of modern tech can be defeated by a $ 1 stone age piece of tech . 
  case in hand : existing pictures of refugees using clothes to neutralize the barbed wire 's spikes . 
  the good side of it is that we do n't have to deal with the fallout when something goes wrong and people die or property is damaged . 
  we are prophylactic ( maybe to the extreme ) . 
  we have godwin 's law , but things like this indicate that there should be a law stating that the level-headedness of a public forum is inversely proportional to its popularity . 
  shame . 
  his bros down south ragequited after they lost a shit ton of money and the insurgency still would n't back down , in case you want a recent history lesson .

  hello mr. trump , it seems you lost your way . 
  may i suggest a good hairdresser and an airplane back to the rep. primaries ? 
  i 'll have you know that i shaved my head last week because it is more economical to visit the hairdresser less frequently , and also wear black t-shirts everywhere , because black looks cool . 
  i also bought this cool armband that has a [ meander ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/meander_%28art%29 ) on it .

  quite an improvement to manage to fuck up the country every 50 years , instead of every 20 . 
  until your king cockblocks a perfectly social democratic government because of communist paranoia , and allows the army to take over . 
  then tries to fix things , and fails too . 
  and the rest of western europe and the us allies do nothing . 
  in fact , they give their blessings and make business partnerships . 
  then it comes out of the realm of moronic leftwing conspiracy , and hits you at the face with the force of reality .

  bonus : or when your king does not allow the country to join the allied cause during ww2 and supports the prime minister/greek version of hitler , because he is german-born . 
  or when your king does not allow the country to join the allied cause during ww1 , because he is german-born . 
  generally , when your king acts irrationally against national self-interest , just because of his heritage and subsequent frame of mind .

  they are at 6 % while the second and first party are around 25 % . 
  even though the major parties ca n't form a government on their own , they are still calling the shots , and no one wants neo-nazis in the government ; they are under an informal quarantine . 
  now , now . 
  this is perfectly fine .

  because it 's hard to place an advertisement written in arabic in a danish newspaper , or in any other country 's newspaper along the route of the travelling refugees ... 
  that logic simply indicates that the result is unpredictable , because the polls can not be trusted . 
  nothing more , nothing less . 
  metron analysis , the company that predicted 49 % to the ` no ' vote and 46 % to the ` yes ' vote , with the end result being 60 % to 40 % . 
  just to freshen up your memory . 
  and the general public somehow still has the impression that polls are objective , scientific and trustworthy . 
  top kek . 
  polls that predict a tie when the end result is a 20 % difference ( referendum , end results 60 % vs 40 % ) are called ** lies ** , not `` inconvenient '' , and their companies ** untrustworthy ** . 
  it 's impossible to sugarcoat it , you are just making a fun of yourself .

  the shit were we are supposed to believe automatically georgian ( that fucking domain ) or nato ( radio free europe/radio liberty ) propaganda sources just because the russian ones ( rt ) are so bad that they are ridiculing themselves ? 
  i mean come on , the world is not black and white , you do n't have any obligation to believe the opposite side by reflex .

  google maps helps demonstrate what will happen * if * russian troops where there , nothing more . 
  you need to establish if there are russian troops there at all , something that this epitome-of-bias source can not do . 
  we think ourselves as europeans , and find it strange if we are left outside of europe while our neighbouring countries are participating . 
  that 's what she said , not sure how you are twisting this like we are aryans or some similar bs . 
  not to mention , the prefect of attica is a municipal politician , and her word is n't of the same importance as the one of a national politician . 
  they deal with menial issues like trash collection or light fixture replacements .

  upvotes and downvotes are supposed to judge submissions , not the redditors . 
  they do have a sign language interpreter , but i am not sure if sign language is global . 
  a dedicated translator to english for live sessions would increase the cost , but not so much in my opinion . 
  you are on the internet , on an anglophone site where everyone is writing under a nickname . 
  always assume that a us kid bored from summer vacation is trolling you with an eastern european flair flag , than an actual eastern european . 
  if in doubt , check submission and comment history . 
  and do n't pay attention to 0-day accounts with no history . 
  the most recent article i read as an argument for this , said the ( greek ) banks took all the money . 
  the local news for the past years say that banks do no give loans , so it 's apparent that whatever money greece is getting , it does n't trickle down to the people .
