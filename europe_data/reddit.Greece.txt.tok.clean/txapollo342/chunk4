  are people 's dreams in shambles everywhere in the world after a global economic crisis ? 
  are they angry and wish to hang you as an example ? 
  do n't worry , the external enemy ^ \u00ae solution is here !, 
  just pity them against each other , take their focus off you !, 
  external enemy ^ ( \u00ae ) , keeping the rulers of every country safe and sound , * est. 
  * civilization 's origins . 
  i find it hard to believe that an educated person like krugman insulted entire countries . 
  he is critical to austerity policies and nothing more . 
  are you sure that it is n't you who calls latvians and lithuanians names or character-assasinates krugman , with that little `` basically boils down to '' strawman argument ? 
  paul krugman posts critiques of austerity . 
  in the case of estonia , a short , data-based , graph ass-wiping of the austerity `` triumph '' that the right-wing media were claiming as a validation of neoliberal policies . 
  the `` triumph '' being a recovery to a worse level than pre-crisis . 
  the estonian president got somewhat butthurt over that , i guess he was a proponent of those policies . 
  i understand , it 's harsh seeing your theory getting ripped apart by the experiment . 
   it 's about who screams loudest . 
  it 's about making the poor eat each other before they start eating their masters , actually . 
  good ol' war and external enemies . 
  * basically every leader telling their population `` we are not responsible for the hardship you are enduring all these years by our own hand , suddenly its the fault of the greeks who dared to say ` no more ' just last week . 
  go shout at them . '', 
  judging from op 's title , various politically incorrect subreddits and the 1000 + liveleak comments taking it at face value , it was quite successful . 
  * [ grabs popcorn ] *, 
  valuing union political identity over temporary fiscal problems or separate national identities . 
  it boils down to whether you put a political union over fiscal , and nationalists do n't like these ideas . 
  you do n't see the us kicking out poor states , it supports them . 
  we voted on an openly published proposal stemming from months of negotiations . 
  the referendum text is [ out there to read for yourself ] ( http://www.referendum2015gov.gr/en/why-a-referendum/proposal-of-the-institutions-to-the-greek-government-full-text/ ) . 
  not on a tabloid-like statement of `` gib moar monis '' . 
  or the ~ ~ herders ~ ~ planners can stop being so inflexible and think about the possibility that their plan is faulty , and in need of adjustment . 
  then the ~ ~ sheep ~ ~ people will be able to follow the plan . 
  it does n't matter if it was void , it was still a product of months of negotiations , and forms the basis of further negotiations . 
  so by having a vote on it and judging from the relative percentages , everyone sees without doubt or media bending how well received such policy is by the people , and plans accordingly . 
  brussels understands this , it 's up to them to propose the same bad deal and get angry again after a few months , when people have no wish to follow through . 
  a democracy does n't have infinite leverage and can not force its people to follow or not resist to a plan , no matter how good it seems or how well-designed it appears to its creators . 
  who makes the effort needs to be specified . 
  no matter how perfect a plan drawn from a government and its partners seems , it can not be implemented in the real world if people actively resist it . 
  it needs to be redesigned . 
  in other news , north korea viewed from space is completely dark at night . 
  many advance in ecological friendliness . 
  wow . 
  the new berlin wall will be erected in the case of grexit , when people will try to flee the bankrupt country , economically resembling east germany . 
  what a populist truth-twisting piece of shit . 
  the bad putin will come and eat our pride white children if we give the greek freeloaders leniency . 
  --  / r/europecirclejerk, 
  a better economic deal that will prove that we are a political union , no matter how bad things are . 
  and marginalize nationalists and separatists once and for all in this continent , who use this hard stance as weight that the eu is heartless to its members . 
  putting them in the same historical trash can as us confederates . 
  best korea lives only on great leader 's eternal gratitude , why should greeks have it better ? 
  lepen and farage are always right ( like / pol / ) , immigrants are going to eat our children and greeks are lazy moochers . 
  and i am not racist , * butt * ... balance : restored . 
  that 's nice . 
  we did n't vote no to europe , and we did n't vote to be associated with bigots like lepen and farage . 
  ^ ( amount of downboats : how many white righters ' jimmies i am rustling ), 
  they can put pressure , but they have no effective way to enforce it . 
  countries can be fined for violations . 
  the problem is , they can ignore the decisions and just keep paying the fines using taxpayer money . 
  case in hand for greece , we keep using landfills as a waste management system . 
  we had ( probably still have ? ), 
  the same law , nicknamed `` hood-law '' . 
  it 's illegal to cover your face in public . 
  the police used this in the past to prosecute protestors . 
  because apparently it 's an act of terrorism to defend against generous use of tear gas , you are supposed to sit and inhale like a good citizen . 
  certain types of poisoning or carbon monoxide asphyxiation are two methods that i can recall right now . 
  there are non-violent ways to commit suicide . 
  the problem is that depression comes hand-to-hand with suicidal thoughts , while cancer does not . 
  you can not tell easily if the wish to die is a result of the depression or not . 
  in the case of cancer , you wish to die as a result of the physical pain . 
  stay polite . 
  we do not understand the mind as excellent as we understand the body , in my opinion . 
  euthanasia should be reserved for physical diseases until we improve that understanding . 
  this opens the way to abuse of the law , the state might prefer euthanazing people instead of dealing with the increased cost of mental healthcare .

  the proof is one funny image and a few seconds of video away . 
  do n't resort to ad hominem . 
  the central bank of greece has an official voluntary account , maybe they need to take notes on the execution  http://www.bankofgreece.gr/pages/en/other/publicdebt.aspx, 
  on the opposite , the middle class is hit , the lower classes do not even have the luxury of $ 60 to withdraw per day . 
  i think we can work out a deal , send us your surplus furries and we will send you our surplus civil servants . 
  * members of antarsya , a greek fringe far-left anti-eu group never elected in parliament , burn euros outside of local eu offices . 
  he makes a remark on a government slogan , and i respond to him by saying that a panic is bad regardless of political preference . 
  too much football mentality . 
  it 's really sad that you and others cheer and spread pictures like this , like it 's not bad regardless of political opinion . 
  context : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_wiretapping_case_2004%e2%80%9305, 
  his speech even contained a mention to hard-line conservatives refusing to accept the failure of neo-liberal policy , or to accept measures aimed towards the rich . 
  i am not the one that accuses everyone of being a party follower all the time , yet he posts straight news releases of his party whenever something big happens . 
  read this and understand the damage that you are causing : https://www.bostonfed.org/economic/ppdp/2012/ppdp1207.pdf, 
  except you are not spreading truth , you are spreading a feeling . 
  learn to distinguish . 
  i am supporting taking decisions under calm . 
  you are an active part of the problem , spreading panic both here and in / r/greece by screenshoting what the media wants to show . 
  today lots of pensions and wages were deposited . 
  it 's normal for people to queue outside atms in days like this . 
  mainstream media are presenting live video feeds with sensationalist captions like `` dramatical developments '' . 
  scum of the earth . 
  just the easily manipulated ones . 
  today is pension and wage paying day . 
  without previous photos for comparison , this only looks like a bank run . 
  it seems to be a referendum on whether to accept or reject the creditors proposal . 
  in order to legitimize the austerity counter-proposal ; a permission to break the election promise of no austerity . 
  it 's all about how the question will be formed , and the campaigns beforehand . 
  it 's too early to tell . 
  mind you , that `` yes/no to austerity '' proposed spin comes from certain anti-eu politicians , it 's not sure that the government will listen to them and pose the question in this way .
