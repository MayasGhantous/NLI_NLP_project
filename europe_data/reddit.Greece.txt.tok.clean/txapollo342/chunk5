  for lots of people in greece , it is not . 
  that 's why syriza got elected in the first place , they promised euro without austerity . 
  they want this referendum to legitimize the austerity measures and for permission to break that promise . 
  edit as reply to you edit : it seems that they will propose a yes/no to the creditors proposal , to legitimize the counter-proposal . 
  i am hearing the statements of some syriza 's politicians , and they say that the question is accepting or not the proposed measures . 
  so it seems that it will not have the yes/no to euro character , but a yes/no to austerity character . 
  he 's not wrong . 
  he is n't talking about us starting a world war , we all know that from a military standpoint this is ridiculous . 
  he is talking about moderates being marginalized and an authoritarian government coming to power , i.e. 
  what happened in germany before ww2 . 
  golden dawn and people like the conspiracy right-wing nut defence minister are waiting around the corner for yet another disappointment of the people by their government . 
  what you are talking about , / r/europe is a flowery place of objectivity , where you can get an accurate picture of the european community 's thoughts , without any external influence .

  my family has always bought low ( few days fridge life ) or `` high '' ( htst , few weeks fridge life ) pasteurization milk , so i do n't have the habit of buying scm , evaporated or uht for myself . 
  i only buy it for the welfare basket in supermarkets , along with other shelf-stable foods . 
  i prefer to buy evaporated milk and sugar separately when i do this , to give the recipient family the option to sweeten their milk if they want to .

  `` hey guys , we have this gigantic nightmare in the room !,

  mocking is not progress . 
  you do n't progress anything when you mock someone , either by drawings or by cursing over the internet . 
  there are lies , and there are partial lies . 
  this typical partial lie in the dirt-rubbing race against greeks , is spouting an impressive-sounding percentage , without stating the statistical variance of the population it represents , or comparing it against something . 
  the point is to show the terrorists that we do n't care . 
  they love this type of stuff because they keep them at the spotlight ( and gang-ho politicians like this one ) . 
  the solidarity of shitheads is mutual . 
  because provoking hate and islamist extremists , when you see that they are taking the bait , is comparable to all this stuff you mentioned . 
  i am sure that this thread will be an example of moderation , and not brigaded at all by various non-european white rights subreddits , to make an impression about us .

  1984 is accurate in the sense that every power , not just putin 's russia , had been building artificial external enemies hastily in fear that their poors will devour them . 
  textbook history . 
  rich conservatives try to spin 1984 like it 's against communism , when it actually holds up pretty strong against any type of oligarchy . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euromaidan#public_opinion_about_euromaidan :  according to december 2013 polls ( by three different pollsters ) between 45 % and 50 % of ukrainians supported euromaidan , while between 42 % and 50 % opposed it . 
  the biggest support for the protest can be found in kiev ( about 75 % ) and western ukraine ( more than 80 % ) . 
  among euromaidan protesters , 55 % are from the west of the country , with 24 % from central ukraine and 21 % from the east . 
   polls also show that the nation is divided in age : while majority of young people are pro-eu , older generations ( 50 and above ) more often prefer the customs union of belarus , kazakhstan , and russia . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/member_states_of_nato#member_states_by_date_of_accession : fourth , fifth and sixth enlargements of nato since 1999 are former members of the warsaw pact . 
  it 's a significant port with good infrastructure and history . 
  i did n't say they were completely cut off from the black sea . 
  there is a ceasefire now , although low-intensity actions like the one op pictured are continuing . 
  what a civil and constructive comment . 
  sevastopol has a sizable port , that is what i meant . 
  russia wanted to maintain control of that . 
  the referendum was most definitely made up , but you do n't see any resistance on the map at these areas . 
  and a ceasefire is in effect , although fragile . 
  the fact that the ukraine countryside was neutral or pro-russian during the euromaidan and that yanukovich asked for russian intervention before being exiled are major factors for the invasion . 
  russia was threatening against nato deployment near its borders for a long time , they did n't wake up one morning and decided it was a good day to invade ukraine . 
  yeah , you found it , all these people are paid by putin ... 
  except `` russia is at the doorstep '' is exactly the ridiculous simplification that is to be avoided . 
  they supported the rebels , they took crimea , they had their referendum and the conflict lowered in intensity . 
  russia does n't want to invade the whole of ukraine , they wanted a port access to the black sea and they feared they would lose it when ukraine turned pro-eu . 
  we sanctioned them and we reinforced ukraine . 
  i think a sense of measure on our own part is required . 
  and , let 's face the reality , ukraine is not capable to retake crimea by military : [ look at the orange spots on the map , that 's where the fighting is ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:map_of_the_war_in_donbass.svg ) .

  no , i am implying that geography and self-sufficiency do not have a linear relation . 
  i do not know about that . 
  since the green revolution of norman borlaug yields have exploded , so it is possible that we are self-sufficient . 
  the present effect of our geography is that we ca n't compete economically with flat countries like ukraine . 
  i do n't know about soil quality , but yes , greece is mountainous . 
  80 % of the country 's surface is mountains . 
  thessaly is the only big continuous area suitable for farming . 
  we have n't researched terraforming yet . 
  we are still two wonders away from that . 
  maybe we should ask help from the us . 
  this is n't accurate . 
  the opposition to an armed forces tv station stems from the proposal of the minister of defence to establish such a station . 
  it is n't related to ert , the hellenic broadcasting corporation . 
  people oppose it because an armed forces station has been associated in the greek collective consciousness with censorship and authoritarianism , since the 1967-1974 military dictatorship . 
  greece had an armed forces channel during the 1967-1974 military dictatorship . 
  it was disbanded after its * fall , with the technical know-how and equipment being transferred to the hellenic broadcasting corporation . 
  it left a bad imprint in the national conciousness , because people associated an armed forces television with censorship and authoritarianism . 
  the current minister of defence proposed to establish an armed forces channel . 
  if i remember correctly , under the rationale that the armed forces do n't have a public outlet to show their work . 
  this awakened the aforementioned bad imprint .
