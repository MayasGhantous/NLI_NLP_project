the irony ... 
  imagine one of the piigs voting in their parliament something like that . 
  mayhem . 
  please , the only thing that selling ote did was pushing down the prices as it stopped being a corrupted organization making mostly one person richer ( kokkalis ) while keeping us in the dark age of the internet . 
  we still rely mostly on copper lines and vdsl ( that was selected as the next `` best '' thing instead of going to fiber to ensure a steady broadband future up to par with developed countries ) is far away from being broadly available to consumers . 
  third one is the same with the subtitled one . 
  you assume an attack based on allegations of a fisherman out of a video that 's shit . 
  i never said that was n't a greek coast guard ship . 
  in the subtitled video the scenes start before any `` attack '' . 
  according to the subtitles at least . 
  try again ? 
  maybe because the narration of the `` fisherman '' is out of a turkish propaganda book ? 
  can you point me to the video at the second where the greek coast guard `` pops '' the boat ? 
  you ca n't because it 's `` cut '' at very specific points to satisfy the narrative . 
  pathetic . 
  and news sites picking this up even more pathetic . 
  do you have a source for that ? 
  the numbers i 've seen reported go from 100 to 200.000 . 
  always talking about greek citizens . 
   what ? 
  it might be against the geneva convention or something , but i am pretty sure turkish people moving to cyprus for more sunshine does not constitute `` genocide '' . 
  lol . 
  sorry , that 's the only reply i genuinely had to that . 
  i would n't say greeks hate people from fyrom . 
  only some nationalist s would carry hate like you mention it . 
  greeks keep investing in your country and the general commercial relations are more than fine . 
  cool story about bureaucracy but your latter comments do n't make sense . 
  economic progress , territorial integrity and historical accuracy are both important on their own accord and any `` trolling '' as you mention it or mass propaganda wo n't change historical facts dear neighbor . 
  suddenly inventing a cultural identity has a cost . 
  besides that though , the [ agency for electronic communications ] ( http://skopje2014.prizma.birn.eu.com/obj.aspx?id=42 ) building looks quite tacky and ... weird . 
  i hope all these expenses wo n't affect future budgets much . 
  now i crave some halloumi and seftalies . 
  dammit . 
  you can make saganaki with halloumi . 
  saganaki is a process of making a fried cheese appetizer dish . 
  that graph is a bit misleading since the relative ownerships percentage in greek population is quite high . 
  almost 1 in 2 greeks might have ownership of a `` village '' house - even if it 's abandoned for decades . 
  60.000 owners with swiss franc mortgages were affected when franc stopped being pegged to euro . 
  franc mortgages were n't ** that ** popular so you can imagine the total numbers . 
  [ according to this ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2013/12/09/greek-banks-find-mortgage-ban-exploiters/ ) , mortgage loan owners protected under the 1st house non-foreclosure law are 200.000 ( or were so , in 2013 ), 
  exactly , i grew up drinking uht milk ( 90s ) and we were the exception of a family . 
  people were weird like `` you store your unopened milk out of the fridge ?! '', 
  ah , an example of fine journalism . 
  greece limits the shelf life of ** fresh ** milk to five days . 
  not milk generally . 
  there is also 1-day milk sold . 
  a lot of consumers prefer fresh milk . 
  and it 's a matter of competition between local milk producers and cheap milk imported . 
  ( due to logistics , fresh milk is usually greek ) no wonder why netherlands was the one country mostly pushing the `` milk reform '' . 
  we import rioters now ? 
  sigh . 
   paying taxes is not optional . 
  everyone has to do it . 
  ** everyone ** with the ** ability ** to pay taxes have to pay taxes according to that ability based off of their incomes . 
  in this case , the system is unfair . 
  a fair tax system would lead to less - * low level * - tax avoidance . 
  a strong tax system would minimize the - criminally level - tax evasion that 's the majority of the tax black hole . 
  a currency union requires mostly a fiscal union ( with transfers ) which is more or less a collective policy union on fiscal ( and related ) matters . 
  what you fail to understand about the hashtag you sarcastically mention is that there was a request of a technocrat government again to replace the current one . 
  and that 's where the sovereignty issue comes to play . 
  i hope it wo n't come to a time where russia collapses and you get overwhelmed with illegal immigrants and you face a similar situation . 
  where is your source ? 
  greece has n't gotten any money from the bailout since summer 2014 . 
  the bailout many were up to 90 % used to re-finance or rollover loans . 
  get your facts straight and quit your own bullshit . 
  do you have any sources whatsoever for everything you claim ? 
  `` major impact of budget '' you mention , yet the `` humanitarian crisis bill '' that syriza passed created a havoc ( got warned it will be perceived as unilateral action - confirms the varoufakis quote ) and it would have a maximum - true - $ 500 million impact over the year . 
  would n't a tax reform cause a major impact as well ? 
  provided it was n't successful at the first 1-2 years . 
  it was mentioned above `` close loopholes of tax system '' - and there 's the problem . 
  due to additional over additional legislation the greek tax system is complicated as fuck which allows the loopholes . 
  it needs to be completely rewritten . 
  the parliament indeed is responsible for lawmaking but most major bills come from the government party and a major law is n't just `` we voted it , good job '' , but a more complicated process until it 's on effect . 
  [ yeah , okay ] ( http://media2.giphy.com/media/fml0fgaxvx1em/giphy.gif ), 
  i 'm obliged to quote varoufakis :  the most frustrating part is that these negotiations are taking up all our energy and time . 
  and moreover : the institutions are telling us , ** if we legislate before we reached a comprehensive agreement this will be seen as a unilateral action ** and it will blow up the negotiations . 
  one of the very first things i said to my eurogroup colleagues was , ** why do n't we push some of the legislation we agree on -- the taxation system ** , the anti-corruption rules -- through parliament and meanwhile continue the negotiations ? 
  and i was actually told a number of times if i dare to suggest this again this would constitute reason to settle the negotiations . 
  bold are mine . 
  [ source is here ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/sections/euro-finance/varoufakis-greeces-creditors-have-turned-negotiations-war-315247 ) - i have n't found any ez official contradicting what he said there . 
  after i replied , i wondered why you were being downvoted in some one sentence replies . 
  now i can see why . 
  most the other posts cover more or less the general idea . 
  about greece , i would say that it 's a matter that has n't been handled that well . 
  afaik roma are n't homogeneous and different tribes ( ? ), 
  behave , develop differently . 
  thus , we have a lot of roma communities completely integrated and - although suffering some discrimination - part of the society . 
  the problem is the communities that are still camps and generate a lot of crime . 
  some might say that it 's due to poverty , but truth be told , there have been numerous police interventions where people tent-like housing were hiding tons of money ( procured illegally : drugs , human trafficking , child beggary schemes ) there are parts of athens suburbs that people try to avoid roma . 
  it 's racist , but having seen with my own eyes what can happen if you 're not alert ( on purpose running in the middle of the street to get hit , gang following to ask for money ) i would n't be quick to judge . 
  but there is a lot of racism in other aspects , e.g. 
  schooling , where whole communities deny roma children entry to the schools . 
  tl ; dr : there is discrimination and poor behavior towards roma , but it 's not so unjustified due to people personal experiences , but this is such a vicious circle . 
  yes . 
  there is no other human possible way they reached lesbos in this example . 
  although i agree with you partially , just look at the map . 
  you think it 's just a coincidence that greek islands off from turkish coasts are bloated with refugees ? 
  or . . would turkey claim `` perhaps the went to egypt and sailed their boats north '' ? 
  learn the difference between in arrears and under default . 
  your whole comment is a hateful mess .
