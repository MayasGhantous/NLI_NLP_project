  perhaps you 're describing yourself ? 
  yeah , after the greek finance stability fund ( with bailout funds ? ), 
  spent 11bl to save the bank and had 95 % of shares which then allowed to change hands for less than 3bln ... eurobank stronk . 
  * should n't the tax system be reformed to decide where to hire whom ? 
  it 's been crippled by the last 2 governments ( not that it was running smoothly before ) * there have been such news , it should stop . 
  * 5 month ruling party , they just got advantage of the lagarde list and it 's still too early for everyone to know what are they doing with it ( besides the published prosecutions/arrests ) * let 's go again , no major reform could have been done during negotiations as it would be considered unilateral action . 
  i can refer you also to tsipras secondary speech on why not much have happened yet . 
  is n't this new bailout supposed to be a ** 3 year program ** ? 
  it would make sense measures that expand to a longer span of time to procude a higher number of `` savings '' for the budget . 
  i stopped reading after :  after greeks overwhelmingly voted against troika 's terms for extended debt relief assistance the world is holding its breath clearly has no idea what he 's talking about . 
  `` extended debt relief assistance '' ... 
  oh now you 're worried about that ? 
  not when ireland and greece were fucked for the same reason ? 
  ( and cyprus too ) unless you 're referring to just the german taxpayer and not about the european taxpayer . 
  ugh , i do n't know , would you ask the same if the picture sequence - from guardian ? 
  - was about french vs romanian wine ? 
  each country - or specific producers - produce things of variant quality . 
  in installments or as one sum ? 
  the thing is , most greek businesses are classified as `` really small businesses '' with 1 to 10 employees ( including freelancers/contractors ) and they already have liquidity issues , no access to credit lines and an ongoing reduction of income due to greeks having reduced incomes themselves . 
  perhaps that helps you see the problem i 'm describing with competitiveness . 
  excellent chart . 
  because we all know that bailout loans were distributed to each person so a per capita comparison makes so much sense from a statistical standpoint / s, 
  op is a bit confusing on that part . 
  he 's referring to the proposed 100 % tax-advance for next fiscal year . 
  currently stands at 55 % . 
  basically , this kills small business liquidity and it 's based on the idea `` look , we assume you 're gon na have same or more profits next year , so pay up in advance '' . 
  yeah , it 's not like taxes are raised by the textbook , but in business reality , is double taxation because you 'll keep paying this advance . 
  greek businesses need to be competitive they said . 
  sigh . 
  well , no , not directly . 
  greek banks will be insolvent without ela liquidity . 
  which means the banking system will collapse . 
  after that , a new currency is down the road and possibly ( 99,99 % ) a missed payment towards ecb ( july 20th ) that will be an official default . 
  you got ta love twitter . 
  so much confusion . 
  from what i could gather : the discussion today was on the proposal that greece submitted midweek ( july 1st ? ), 
  before the referendum which was based on the junker proposal after the referendum was announced ( june 28 ? 
  i ca n't recall , i 'm confused as well ) . 
  the above was never discussed on the eurogroup because they wanted to wait to see the referendum results . 
  you can become a country then . 
  republic of lickmypoulenc, 
  economically speaking , it 's mostly our fault . 
  but you know , we did n't cause a fucking global crisis , it was the other way around and we got exposed the most due to the decades of irresponsible government spending and troubled economy . 
  should have posted at / r/greece but ... dude . 
  mykonos , is like a different country inside greece . 
  of course have cash on hand but you wo n't have any issues there . 
  also , especially due to mykonos having more tourists from abroad , acceptance of cc is widespread . 
  ( also , if a shop with a visa/mastercard logo declines to accept yours , they can be fined , it 's against their agreements ) have fun . 
  [ a bit older table from eurostat until 2099 ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=lfsi_exi_a&amp;lang=en ) - [ 1970-2012 xls data from oecd ] ( http://www.oecd.org/els/emp/summary_1970+values.xls ) 62.1 vs 61.9  40 % of the greek economy is the public sector . 
  do ** you ** have a source for that ? 
  if you 're referring to number of public sector workers , it 's about 12 % of labour force population . 
  that article has been rebuffed before in 2-3 topics . 
  it talks about the majority of public sector workers that indeed had outrageous early pension benefits . 
  average age of retirement between germany and greece is the same . 
  what inflation though ? 
  we 're getting into different waters . 
  for 2014 , it was 0.4 % , way lower than the +2 % ez target . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  add inflation ( or internal deflation ) + interest on those loans and the math is a bit different . 
  and more complicated . 
  also , gross domestic product does n't mean that the greek government has `` $ 242 billion '' every year and decides where to spend what amount . 
  trolling much ? 
  a large part of a whole generation has emigrated during the crisis . 
  estimated numbers are from 150 to 200.000 , most with higher education , causing a brain drain . 
  if that continues , well , then , greece is doomed , not because of a shaky banking system , but because there would n't be enough production force to take over and re-start the economy . 
  that 's not a viable solution . 
  i was honest saying kudos !, 
  we voted no on a referendum about a specific proposal that - according to our government - was `` take it or leave it '' from the eurogroup with certain austerity measures that would n't include any future debt relief/restructuring as it was promised back in 2012 . 
  we did n't vote no on a question like `` do you want to pay back any debt ? '', 
  it 's really a complicated matter . 
  a potential debt relief tied with a bounce back from greece would n't harm the creditors in the long term . 
  a debt relief can have many forms . 
  dear maher_98 , i suppose that the 98 sets your birth year ( kudos if you 're a tax payer already btw ) so i would n't judge your lack of knolwedge on what has happened to greece . 
  i would n't expect my 16y old self to be fully informed about economic developments in my country , nor any other country . 
  similary to the irish people 's suffering , we have suffered too . 
  i could give you numbers , graphs and everything related in between but the truth is just that : the suffering would continue for the average greek on a strict austerity path . 
  what makes you think that we did n't cut budgets , we did n't lay off public servants ( with our health system taking a huge hit ) or that taxes were n't raised ? 
  ( the inability to collect all of that tax is a matter that needs to be of focus )  yes , but they are not paying it off its immature really i 'm quoting also this comment of yours . 
  do you really think that it 's a matter of `` greeks being immature '' and not wanting to pay back ? 
  greece have n't received any help since last summer while the economy - with a tight austerity plan still in place - kept plummeting and nothing was improving ( unless if you count some negligent growth that did n't even last more than 2 quarters ) . 
  [ here is the official imf press release ] ( http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2010/pr10130.htm ) that was part of the additional funding of imf reserves to increase lending capacity due to the global crisis . 
  excuse me ? 
  are you saying that czech republic loaned imf ? 
  you got a source for that ? 
  or ... are you confusing this to the czech participation to the imf reserves , that translates into the voting power your country has ? 
  because that is 1 bilion euros . 
  almost as much as greece has participated with to the imf reserves . 
  [ imf member quotas and voting power ] ( https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/memdir/members.aspx ), 
  he has taught in 3-4 universities in the past . 
  texas , uk , australia ( and greece ), 
  amen . 
  someone else said it too . 
  they 're not even relevant to this situation . 
  i would take it and debate if e.g. 
  portuguese people posted as a comparison and we 'd have a nice debate . 
  the only source of this is the telegraph . 
  greek news sites reference them . 
  i am skeptical there was no coverage since this happened ( friday ) also , on friday , there was only an incident with a small group anarchists/extremists trying to stirr things up , perhaps the crew was caught into that ? 
  generally tv crews got hate because throughout the referendum preperations they were everywhere , outside banks , central squares painting a really depressing image with their reporting . 
  i 'm sorry but i do n't really get your point .
