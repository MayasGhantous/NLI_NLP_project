  you 're mixing common currency with a common ... basic hourly wage and cost of living ? 
  a common currency does n't dictate an automatic similar cost of living or similar wages . 
  what a lot of people miss when analyze how greece or other south eu economies impact the euro , is that they keep/kept it low . 
  and a lot of northern eu countries got really benefited by this with their exports due to a strong economy . 
  ( with germany abusing it to the limit with a 7 % of gdp trade surplrus and keeping internal spending and wages as low as it could ) the problem is n't the euro . 
  the problem is how the eurozone is structured . 
  truthfully , if it 's to stay the same , it should be a `` strongeconomieseuro '' . . ** but ** then they 'll have an expensive as fuck currency and their competitiveness would plummet . 
  a coin has two sides , 
  well , fuck you back . 
  but just you , czech republic still gets love . 
  * had * . 
  but not similar . 
  really expensive , yes . 
  not exit polls . 
  there we no exit polls conducted . 
  these are opinion polls/surveys conducted by companies during the weekend by phone . 
  by law they were n't allowed to publish anything after friday . 
  all polls that were done perhaps during the weekend show a slight margin win of `` no '' ( oxi ) by 2 % to 6 % . 
  those are n't exit polls , nor official results . 
  those are survey companies result projections .

  so , i did some digging , because it would be illegal if those were members of the electoral comittee . 
  [ it was tweeted by a guardian reporter ] ( https://twitter.com/daniel_howden/status/617698167283404800 ) these are polling representatives of the `` oxi '' . 
  i would assume that there are polling reps of `` nai '' on the opposite side of the room . 
  the law allows each party ( in this case of the referendum , each `` answer '' group ) to have reps in each polling station to oversee , object or make notes about the process . 
  so i do n't think this is something illegal . 
  you can see the bench is n't one that 's part of the process to go vote . 
  i 'm not sure if the `` oxi '' papers on the desk are up to the law letter but they are allowed to have those stickers . 
  during general elections , party reps have their party stickers . 
  propaganda strong . 
  i would be in for some control and mostly , oversight of the greek government but ... not like it was done during the troika visits . 
  we had some technocrats , out of touch with reality , coming every 1-3 months saying `` huh ... our program is failing here and here , cut more here '' the eurogroup might not want to outright ` punish ' greece , but some proposals coming through them have a bit of punitive feeling . 
  because troika said that any major reform/new law would be considered a unilateral move from the greek government . 
  the government is been tied to the measures , agreements , and imho ca n't function properly for the past year . 
  ( of course the blame is on both sides for things dragging out this long ), 
  well , greece does n't have to actually pay all of the debt . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  the key is to keep servicing your debt and - in the case of greece - have a plan to reduce the debt to gdp ratio to keep it sustainable . 
  to do all the above , you need some growth along with changes . 
  otherwise , you cut , you cut , and cut and you end up with 175 % debt-to-gdp compared to the 110 % you started with . 
  why were n't they broke though ? 
  how could this be . 
  greeks with money ? 
  they should have honeymooned to a lot less expensive place , perhaps after permission . 
  hell , why did they even got married ? 
  perhaps to get them tax breaks after starting a family . 
   the current government did nothing and refuses to do anything and they also said they wo n't do anything , while doing nothing , plus they 're secretly plotting to do nothing / s, 
  what i would ask regarding your 1 ) based on the imf report is what do they include in the november 2012 framework . 
  are the imf failed projections included to render greece not sticking to that framework ? 
  i 've only made a quick read to the report . 
  it mentions the opportunity through falling interest rates and also the failed privetization targets . 
  i 'm so glad that those targets were n't met . 
  a delusional plan that would make greece lose even more . 
  it involved the privatization of public water/sewage company ( see uk 's example ) , privatization of deh ( power ) , elpe ( greek petroleum ) among others . 
  all profitable . 
  and with the example of opap ( betting ) privatization that went through gaining pennies ( ~ $ 650m for 33 % while the annual profits were $ 1b ) , thanks , but no thanks . 
  it also mentions the ... `` lower economic growth '' . 
  possible rephrasing here is the shrinking of greek economy , every year , contrary to what imf had forecasted . 
  as for your number 2 ) - i would personally prefer a gradual debt relief . 
  or a relief tied to reforms and growth ( what varoufakis had proposed since he took office ) . 
  a real growth coming from a structurally reformed economy . 
  no sane person - with knowledge of the greek system - would want a huge debt writeoff and us being able to re-borrow again at will . 
  syriza wants to reform - if they can actually , that 's a different story - but should be allowed to , as during the negotiations , big reforms were held back until * everything * was agreed upon . 
  again , my comment is for the sake of the argument under the op text we 're commenting upon . 
  if it was a finnish mp i would use them as an example . 
  imho , nothing is over . 
  i personally do see a preliminary agreement reached , a referendum going 55-60 % `` yes '' and a change of greek government under the same parliament for the time being . 
  my example scenario above was to prove my point and i 'm not saying directly that this is the official german government speaking . 
  thus i added the ps , but oh well ... 
  okay . 
  let 's take this assumption : tsipras betrayed the trust of other eu leaders - but mostly germany 's - with certain actions and varoufakis is persona non grata because of his rhetoric . 
  right ? 
  right . 
  how would you feel if in 10 years , france , under this hypothetical scenario , held a really important key to something that would affect the german economy dearly and there were talks for a positive outcome . 
  and then , french government said `` nope , nothing for your people unless you eject your government '' . 
  ** how democratic would that feel to you ? 
  ** * mind the gap between being a democracy , and acting in respect of democratic values . 
  * i ca n't wrap around my head how after incidents like these - if it 's true - i see a few users comment `` but germany ca n't dictate the whole eu policy '' or `` it 's not germany vs greece '' or `` it 's not like germany elected your government '' * ding ding ding * ps : i have nothing against germans and i do n't support any conspiracy theories . 
  the above serves to prove a point . 
  it might be that if it had flexible funding . 
  it has fixed funding for 1.6 b euros . 
  so , to me , it 's more of a symbolic crowdfunding campaign as it wo n't reach the goal and no money would be collected . 
  imo he 's an ambitious politician and could lead greece successfully , * buuuut * ... syriza right now ( the party he 's head of ) is a puzzle of far-leftists that want out of the euro , ex-pasok members , randoms from other parties that wanted some piece of the cake called government and some other incompetent mps that ca n't even understand what running a country is like . 
  in between , there are a few decent politicians around him but i do n't think their voice can be heard `` louder '' than the rest of the bunch . 
  the above is why we 're fucked . 
  there is a shortage of decent and competent politicians . 
  the alternatives of pasok+nd is like going back to your torturer and asking for more of the medicine that lead the country here . 
  i wo n't even mention potami . 
  just ... sigh . 
  going back to tsipras , i believe he tried his best keeping a balance while working towards a solution during those 5 months . 
  perhaps he broke under internal party pressure , perhaps he just ca n't handle all of this . 
  there are a lot of things we do n't know . 
  i am a bit reserved currently . 
  there we go again , i have to repeat myself . 
  varoufakis was against capital controls and perhaps his stance is opposite to those completely ( given his tweet ) but he did n't order the capital controls himself . 
  the banking sector under the central bank of greece had a meeting and decided - logically - that since the ela is n't going to be capped up , it 's the only solution . 
  varoufakis had the ability to deny the request but was pressured by the chairman of bog ( `` accept or i quit '' ) which would cause even more instability . 
  so ... you are the ones competing with lower vat in tourism . 
  6 % vs 6.5 %  a lot of countries have that lower vat rates for certain categories . 
  greece ai n't special or benefited any differently by certain vat categories .
