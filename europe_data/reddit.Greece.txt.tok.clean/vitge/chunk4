  also , why do you confuse vat with corporate tax ? 
  the thing that you do n't know is under our current system , corporations/small businesses pay 100 % of the due tax plus 55 % of the next year 's tax as an advance . 
  it 's a miracle idea the from 2013 tax law that works under the assumption that you 're gon na have more profits next year so just give us the advance now so we can have more liquidity . 
  so , i , too believe that it 's 2 ) which will kill whatever small business sector there 's left . 
  so , this is n't true ? 
   standard vat rate : 23 % ( jan 2011 )  reduced vat rates : 13 % foodstuffs , agricultural supplies  reduced vat rates : 6 % foodstuffs , books , pharmaceutical , medical , newspapers , hotels , passenger transport  portugal drops 2015 vat hike [ source ] ( http://www.vatlive.com/vat-rates/european-vat-rates/eu-vat-rates/ ), 
  since op above has n't responded , i call dibs on your invitation and i 'll show your printed comment to the immigration office < 3 thanks !, 
  and your point ? 
  we actively ** want ** to pay more ? 
  we should bargain for prices ? 
   you would need around 2,338.81 $ ( 10,286.55 lei ) in athens to maintain the same standard of life that you can have with 7,200.00 lei in bucharest ( assuming you rent in both cities ) . 
  this does n't fit your views for a complete comparison ? 
  that shows you 'd need +40 % more money to maintain a similar lifestyle . 
  ( even if that auto-calculated example the `` lifestyle '' threshold is stupidly high ), 
  sure , you take 1 indicator that shows that to you and you turn this around . 
  ignoring all the main indicators that have a percentage comparison . 
  i can do the same with a berlin - athens comparison , with `` better '' results . 
  when incomes go down really fast , does n't mean that the prices of consumer goods or services will follow at the same pace . 
  especially when you rely on imports for many categories . 
  but what are the romanians or former soviet block users of / r/europe gon na comment now ?!, 
  y u do dis . 
  seriously , the amount of such comments the past month - mostly - is ridiculous . 
  if yes/no referendum options had 50 % each before the juncker speech , it just got shifted towards 70 % `` no '' . 
  amateurs . 
  greek government & ez , bunch of crazy monkeys . 
  thankfully - some bank branches will open for pensioners - i do hope not just for today & that this wo n't result in people trying to rush in under panic even though they 're not pensioners just to get money out . 
  head of bank of greece ( stournaras ) requested the capital controls after a system banks meeting and said that if the request is n't granted by varoufakis he will quit . 
  who said anything about photoshop ? 
  you do n't even get what i 'm talking about . 
  i ca n't take adonis seriously . 
  both adonis tweet image and the 4 above ( including the one from 8 months ago or something ) are from the national bank of greece atms . 
  along with piraeusbank is the biggest bank with less atm points and with a lot of pensioners having their accounts there . 
  there have always been lines in their stores and atms , ** always ** . 
  glad that someone else noticed that as well . 
  the whole debt restructuring/plan for sustainability in the long term request bundled in this deal was always out of the question . 
  suddenly , it was in the discussion ... right . 
  all of the bailout money are under british law . 
  ( so , ~ 80 % of the debt ), 
  surely . 
  the eurogroup will decide . 
  we 'll know for sure in a few hours . 
  the question will be for something that 's currently on the table ( unless eurogroup decides it 's not anymore ) how naive can you be to think that syriza could only propose cuts , based on what the creditors demanded ? 
  the best bet was a mixture of both spending cuts and taxes to balance the taxing system , ** only ** if there was an inclusion of some debt restructuring in the deal . 
  this is what 's all about . 
  we need to have surpluses to maintain debt repayment but we ca n't do it for long without a debt structure that will allow the budget to breath in the longrun to ensure growth . 
   2.3 editorialising is not acceptable . 
  editorialising is simply the act of inserting an opinion into a ( submission ) title . 
  you should , in most cases , use the title on the page you are linking to . 
  however , in the case of youtube , you may have to be inventive and attempt to create an nonpartisan and neutral title if the one the youtube video uses is clearly partisan and bias . 
  welp . 
  the mode they show images from an atm with a queue the more panic they create to those watching whom in turn they queue to their closest atm just in case . 
  my dad just called me and asked me to go withdraw some money `` just in case '' because `` people are lining up to get theirs '' . 
  it 's not a bank run . 
  but it is spreading fear . 
  re-read my comment . 
  i did n't say that noone is there because they 're afraid the atms wo n't have money tomorrow or on monday . 
  at the same time , i ca n't expect all those with the padofles ( flip-flops ) to have the critical thinking and patience to not rush to an atm . 
  ( an example , i have nothing against flip-flops or people wearing them ), 
  for fuck 's sake . 
  the fear mongering by the greek media right now - as always before - is outrageous . 
  people were lining up at the atms way early this evening because pensions were being deposited due to the weekend before the end of the month . 
  of course there are people at some atms forming lines , of course some are not pensioners but it 's friday night . 
  i was just out for a dog walk , one of the biggest banks had a line of 2 people . 
  the other 8 people . 
  this is about a whole agreement on fiscal measures with both the ez and the imf on board . 
  [ a nice - imo - recap on the story so far by paul mason can be read here ] ( https://medium.com/@paulmasonnews/tsipras-goes-for-referendum-on-5-july-bf4c58d02534 ), 
  the constitution does n't allow a referendum on fiscal matters related to a voted law . 
  this is n't the case . 
  this will be a referendum for an urgent national matter . 
  ( [ analysis by a greek lawyer ] ( http://elawyer.blogspot.gr/2011/10/blog-post_31.html?spref=tw ) on the matter - it 's in greek , not sure if google translate will make sense ), 
  the ela liquidity is tied to the program greece is currently in . 
  if this is extended while the referendum takes place then the support to greek banks will continue . 
  ( this is what tsipras asked now ) now if the program officially ends at 30th of june without any extension , yes , ecb will pull support . 
  there is no default if the imf payment is missed . 
  there is a whole process ( i think up to 3 months ) for a payment to go from overdue to a state of * default *, 
  i have a strong feeling that the majority will vote for the offer as it 's the way to stay in the ez . 
  chain of reactions tho : since syriza is for `` no '' , if there is an alternate result , i see a strong chance of elections . 
  will they be able to rectify the deal in between ? 
  i just love how with your first comment you call tsipras an arrogant prick , but not 10 minutes later , you appear to be exactly that . 
  just a small correction . 
  the `` hardouvelis email '' was a * proposal * towards the creditors that would cover 2015 based on their demands ( which were greater already ) . 
  and it did n't address a lot of creditors demands for reforms . 
  it was a proposal by nd to quickly wrap up things , get funding and go back to discussions for longterm measures . 
  comparing the ~ 8bil of the syriza proposal - rest of 2015 and 2016 + - ( which i do n't like at all ) with that , is like comparing apples with oranges , and it has recently become an easy argument by nd party members . 
  you misunderstood . 
  there are several people arriving e.g. 
  by boat through turkey that have no identification whatsoever and usually claim they 're afghan ( older days during the war ) or syrians so they can claim asylum . 
  the same way dijsselbloem had said that a debt relief/restructuring was certain to happen at the end of the 2nd program but then changed to a new promise tied to surpluses ? 
  as i said ... 
  i have no faith , nor courage to hope for much . 
   according to the minister , greece received $ 360 million to build asylum capacities i 've never heard of that that before . 
  i do know however that $ 360 million were to be spent by amif during 2014-2020 for such expenses . 
  ( throughout europe )  kali\u0148\u00e1k stressed that italy , for example , is a safe country , but the migrants want to go further . 
  `` why do they push themselves on to france and then to britain ? 
  it 's not just an honest effort to save their lives . 
  italy or turkey would do . 
  well , this sums the whole article . 
  of course , greece and italy should just cover the whole mediterranean sea and be the watch dogs while frontex is underfunded and not so efficient . 
  by the way , where should we sent those undocumented people that wash up to southern eu shores ? 
  what a crazy ride .
