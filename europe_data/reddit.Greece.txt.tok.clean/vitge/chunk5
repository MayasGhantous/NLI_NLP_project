  i 've lost any faith i had to ez ( yeah , i 'm perfectly aware this is imf-led counterproposal ) playing with the future of generations like it 's a stock shorting game . 
  at first ez said imf is needed because otherwise measures would be too harsh , now the `` game '' is turning around , ez is the `` good guy '' . 
  i see no light . 
  greece is fucked either way , too bad noone had the balls in 2009 to pull the plug and get done with this . 
  50 % change that you 're trolling . 
  did you open the article link ? 
  the monument is tiny and it 's a municipality initiative . 
  each municipality has their own budget , with deficit or not it 's different than the ** central government ** budget that has to handle the ** state debt ** . 
  this is n't a greek thing , that 's how it works everywhere . 
  your question could easily be up to par with something like `` how can greeks spend money on roads when their country is in debt ? 
  just go with dirt roads '', 
  under the alliance any attack would be a violation of article 1 . 
  more than that , i think the nato security council decides what actions will be taken if there is an invocation of article 5 by the attacked member . 
  yes . 
  the kept putting off the auctions/licencing scheme . 
  it 's one of the most evident cases of corruption and the ties between media and pasok+nd are very strong . 
  i do n't know how the justice system ( higher court ) could intervene in this case . 
  the enforcement of that law/tax + licences auction is part of the latest syriza proposal to the institutions . 
  easily . 
  they gave away `` temporary broadcasting licences '' since 1993 with the inception of commercial tv channels . 
  most tv `` oligarchs '' had close ties with the majority parties . 
  same deal with a 2010 tax on tv ads , 20 % per ad . 
  got postponed every year although it was supposed to help the budget during the crisis . 
  good banks , bad people . 
  and that argument whenever anyone says anything about how irresponsible banks were before the crisis is just bullshit . 
  key ez people knew . 
  others cooked the books here and there as well . 
  the current head of ecb is a goldman-sachs former director . 
  [ numbeo data for athens ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/city_result.jsp?country=greece&amp;city=athens ) can give you a good idea . 
  quick comparison shows us up to par with tallinn in prices ( a bit more expensive ) while the average purchasing power is lower . 
  ( that is , if you 're fully employed ), 
  the 100 installments law is not for the oligarchs . 
  is mostly for people that kept being taxed absurdly or with their small business failing since or before the crisis . 
  varoufakis stated last week that he proposed moving forward with separate issues ( taxation reform , they seem to have an agreement there ) but creditors were n't okay unless a ** complete deal ** is reached . 
  replying also to / u/islanda _ 1973 - that bill 's real cost was too little to affect the budget deficits but ** still ** there was strong opposition and the greek government was ** threatened ** that voting for it may be considered unilateral action . 
   and moreover : the institutions are telling us , if we legislate before we reached a comprehensive agreement this will be seen as a unilateral action and it will blow up the negotiations . 
  one of the very first things i said to my eurogroup colleagues was , why do n't we push some of the legislation we agree on -- the taxation system , the anti-corruption rules -- through parliament and meanwhile continue the negotiations ? 
  and i was actually told a number of times if i dare to suggest this again this would constitute reason to settle the negotiations . 
  iirc the lower limits for full pension is now 67 and for reduced 62 . 
  that 's since 2013 and it was on a rise since 2010 ( gradual rise ) so i do n't know what exactly you 're saying . 
  are you referring to state employees ? 
  there are examples of those getting `` premium '' rules for pensions ( including age limits and benefits ) but hey , usually they ca n't be fired so that 's not what you meant . 
  a reform in the pension/social security system that you say had to be done from the beginning is one of the most difficult to do ( properly ) . 
  a lot more since the pension funds lost a lot of money in our ... * bailout * it basically has to be remodeled because due to years and years of complicated laws there are loopholes left for people to take advantage of the system . 
  the 23 % vat at energy proposal is like a big fuck you from our creditors . 
  ** everything ** will go up in price ( besides the direct burden in an energy bill ) . 
  like it was n't expensive enough already for the average employee to make it month by month . 
  * reforms - operation `` you wo n't survive '' . 
  the graph is indeed awful . 
  and in my search i could only find only one useful website with data ( eurostat - national stats as sources ) i 've made a table ( their charts suck ) with [ pensions expenditure as a % of gdp - eu28 - for 2008 & 2012 ] ( http://www.pordata.pt/en/europe/search+environment/table/5689702 ) . 
  this shows why the bloomberg graph is misleading . 
  in 2008 ( crisis beginning ) greece was really close to the eu average on that indicator . 
  the absolute value of pension spending went down . 
  it 's the gdp that went way more down that creates this 17.4 %, 
  but that 's the problem though , i 'm pretty sure it 's illegal for fiba to say `` oh , hey , those with euroleague guaranteed contract can do whatever , the rest , you have no choice '' . 
  a lot of teams chose eurocup instead of champions league because it is a valid pathway to compete to euroleague at some point . 
  additionally , the prize money of `` champions league '' are laughable , even eurocup ensures better income , not just with prize money , but due to attendance . 
  fiba has gone batshit crazy . 
  the company that handles the port - and its % was sold - was n't losing money . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.olp.gr/en/investor-information/economical-reports ), 
  the imf wants their money back . 
  while pushing for wrong policies since the beginning . 
  they may claim now `` more cuts , less taxes '' but if the math does n't add up , they just do n't care . 
  greece leads also the charts for spending cuts . 
  you know what 's the difference tho ? 
  it does n't fucking work if the economy and the gdp keeps shrinking !!!, 
  when the economy shrinks by 25 % and you do a spending cut of 20 % you 're still worse gdp % wise where you started of . 
  and the imf is discussing what ? 
  the percentages for greece to pay back . 
   knick knack reforms and bullshit the fact that greece is on the top of oecd rankings in reform responsiveness for the last 7 years is bullshit too ? 
  of course the imf does n't need to explain themselves . 
  they already did that after their failed projections during the first program greece was under and after admitting they fucked up with what they pushed for . 
  it baffles me how some people think a country can actually do deep and fast reforms while it 's economy is on freefall for almost a decade and while the creditors/imf are pushing for reforms that will improve the economic framework , they also blood-suck the citizens dry leading to less economic growth . 
  if this is n't a misleading title , i do n't know what is . 
  um , i hate to assume but most greeks mention the `` public sector '' we mean the bloodsucking part of it . 
  the public service sector with people not going to work and still getting absurd wages while could n't be fired , etc , etc. 
  most of the people left in camps ca n't vouch for their own refugee status either . 
  you see the problem ? 
  yesterday a dozen young people from pakistan got arrested in lesbos trying to pose as asylum seekers with fake documents . 
  maybe now you ** see the problem ** ? 
  reply again when you can distinguish between `` refugee '' , `` migrant '' ( and then the subcategories regarding the legality of each category ) different people , different rights , different laws that apply . 
  what are you even on about ? 
  people in piraeus suddenly appeared in the port ? 
  they have been processed before coming to piraeus . 
  why are n't you telling also that they refuse to leave the port ? 
  because they 're hoping they 'll get somehow transportation to eidomeni to cross to fyrom ? 
  let 's not start with the eidomeni camp where the ... not in detention crowds have rioted since yesterday and all the organizations abandoned the camp . 
  not maybe , you are definitely wrong . 
  makeshift camp you mean , not a detention facility . 
  turkish media propaganda stronk . 
  they 're not there to supervise anything , they will participate alongside greek forces and frontex to the process of counting , validating and escorting deported immigrants back to turkey . 
  same number of greek police officers ( immigration dept. ), 
  will be placed across ( turkey ) in reception port cities . 
  is that gross values ? 
  before or after bribing costs ? 
  ( `` cost of doing business '' in accounting international format ) ^ / s, 
  at 1:40 you can see the greek army `` badge '' . 
  and most of them have officer insignia on their arms . 
  city of athens band has red top / black bottom uniform . 
  this is probably the military school band ( evelpidon ),
