  there is only one recognized government over the cyprus island . 
  what turkey wants and what turkey does is their thing . 
  the republic of cyprus includes all cypriots . 
  turkey does n't give a fuck about turkish-cypriots . 
  they took as excuse a wrongdoing ( fueled by greek junta and nationalism ) and did something three ( not literal comparison ) times worse . 
  [ fyi , cyprus before invasion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_invasion_of_cyprus#/media/file:cyprus_1973_ethnic_neutral.svg ) ( purple is turkish-cypriot enclaves ), 
  defending a nation 's history and culture is n't a childish thing . 
  ^ ^ unless ^ ^ you ^ ^ got ^ ^ only ^ ^ 100 ^ ^ years ^ ^ of ^ ^ it, 
  actually , you 're generalizing . 
  maybe you know it . 
  maybe the majority knows it . 
  the issue is n't who knows it now , the issue is that with their [ skopje 2014 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skopje_2014 ) they 're trying to change that . 
  `` trip to macedonia - explore the modern land of the ancient kingdom '' - then you have more and more people eating up propaganda and history altering `` lessons '' - and hey , they 're named `` macedonia '' - it must be true . 
  also , north korea is a world power that enjoys prosperity and kim jong-on is just misunderstood . 
  ( this is where we start saying preposterous stories , right ? ), 
  an eu member state , do n't worry , you do n't have to know them all . 
  rest of the world is enough . 
  difficult to find the actual text in english , [ source mentioning the agreement here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek%e2%80%93turkish_relations#illegal_immigration ), 
  your government is ultra-nationalists and hillbilly scholars ? 
  or , wait , all of your governments ? 
  skopje `` alexander the great '' airport ? 
  `` warrior on horseback '' statue ? 
  ( with the subtle vergina shields ) the ... macedonian arch ? 
  you confuse a country name with local places . 
  apples with oranges . 
  those places do n't claim ancient macedonia history or say people that `` modern kentucky english is based on ancient macedonia language '' . 
  never forget the 25 % of albanians . 
  they would n't like that . 
  yes , it was a sudden decision . 
  based completely on cultural propaganda motivation to become `` relevant '' . 
  who would care about `` vardar '' ? 
   macedonia has been macedonia ever since it was a roman province . 
  [ why , yes , historical maps agree completely ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:roman_empire_map.png ) / s and your comparable example is wrong . 
  it 's more like if malm\u00f6 was an ancient swedish kingdom that expanded over the current danish state and suddenly a part of denmark split and self-proclaimed as `` republic of malm\u00f6 '' and tried to claim its history . 
  there is a bilateral agreement ... since 2001 or so . 
  turkey did n't respect it . 
  `` what , these guys ? 
  no , they did n't come from here , we ca n't take them '', 
  close enough with 40 years of military occupation though . 
  do n't tell me that erdogan would n't do the same in cyprus . 
  i do n't think he was referring to the turkish people . 
  more like , the turkish republic , the state . 
  `` interested in fucking up greece '' is what he said , not `` yeah fuck greece '' . 
  well , if turkey was n't interested in fucking up greece then why did it push their absurd demands related to aegean `` disputes '' in the nato ? 
  such as : - it should be called `` nato air space , not aegean air space '' - no use of greek names , just use numbers for small islands - nato ships should n't dock to dodecanese islands ( based on turkey 's claim of a demilitarized zone - based on a treaty greece signed with ... italy after wwii ) - disregard of the athens fir and consequently denial of recognition for greece sovereign airspace - claiming once more half of south aegean as turkish search & rescue area . 
  you can actually call us hellas , as we are the hellenic republic . 
  you use greece because it comes from the latin term deriving from roman times . 
  as for your comment , it does n't take the center stage of any policy debates . 
  it did , when fyrom was formed . 
  then a single politician failed badly ( was made prime minister and was our previous one . . ) and since then fyrom politicians are the ones juicing this for their own propaganda or any other goals . 
  they actually have the same url with a different permalink mask and i 'm getting downvoted . 
  wow . 
  actually it was ** two diplomats ** confirming the news story you linked . 
  that 's how journalism works in all the civilized world . 
  one source gets confirmed by another source - via the journalist as due diligence . 
  but also , what you linked , ** had nothing to do ** with turkey finally accepting back illegal immigrants coming from their soil - while did no such thing for a couple of decades now that bilateral agreements existed . 
  that 's by 80 % the same article [ you posted ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/48lhww/ankara_denies_turkey_is_blocking_natos_aegean/ ) a few hours ago enriched with a statement by the turkish foreign ministry spokesperson . 
  but with a `` better '' title . 
  hurriyet daily news rss ? 
   `` we do n't feel it necessary to respond to the comments , the source of which we do not know and which are obviously fabricated and most probably aimed at creating provocation , '' turkish officials told h\u00fcrriyet daily news on march 2 yeah , why are they anonymous ? 
  do they have any turkish journalists that helped with their anonymous story ? 
  not asking for me , but for my friend recep tayyip . 
  you 're not even making sense anymore . 
   forgetting that the greek defense minister threatened to flood germany with refugees and jihadists little less than a year ago . 
  in the middle of the grexit crisis , a right-wing populist politician made a threat that you 've taken out of context . 
  which was officially labeled as not the position of the then greek government the day after . 
  but feel free to continue your hate fueled greek bashing . 
  neutral while [ aligned with italy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zog_i_of_albania#relations_with_italy ) ? 
  a counterattack is n't an invasion ... as well as a sudden dislike towards italians , because albanians thought they would n't deliver the `` great albania '' after their defeat to greeks , ca n't be called a resistance . 
  ( actually mentioned in the doc around the 38th minute ), 
  under the law of war we would fight back if we were invaded . 
  now ... under other conventions ( you can google them ) we are obligated to help people that claim asylum and return them if they are not refugees ( to ? 
  turkey that does n't accept them back or to countries from which they do n't have papers from ? ), 
  that ca n't happen in the middle of the sea while they 're sinking their own boats . 
  again , it 's easy to judge when you 're surrounded by mountains . 
  it 's not as simple as you wan na impress to present it . 
  because if it was , eu would have solved it . 
  as a union , not as finger-pointing individual countries with no working solution . 
  i 'm not gon na go into the financial aspect of your accusations much but greece is paying . 
  if we were n't paying back we would n't give a fuck - saying fuck fuck fuck makes a comment bolder i guess . 
  i do n't mean any disrespect but your comment made me laugh . 
  not to mention that greece has asked for help before . 
  as italy . 
  and we 're not talking after 2014 . 
  for a few years now . 
  but then it was n't an influx of 1.000.000 , it was 5-10 % of that and eu did n't care that much . 
  by your financial logic , greece is also at fault because they did n't hold the smyrna ( izmir ) region as administrators after wwi , now turkey would n't have all this sea border with us to let refugees/immigrants cross !, 
  sorry we fucked up and are basically bankrupt and our budget is run by the ez - i understand that 's inconvenient for our lovely union partners at this point . 
   greece knows damn well where the boats are originating from yet they do n't enforce their own sovereignty . 
  there is a moral obligation of the world to help not just eu , but help has its limits to are we going back to greece invading turkey to put the boats back where they came from ? 
  hey , i do n't object , maybe with the whole eu we get constantinople back !, 
  help has limits , eu countries have limits , ** except ** greece . 
  greece has no limits , you can buttfuck greece all you want and it 's all their fault after all with their fucking geopolitical position . 
  tough luck / s, 
  uh , we destroy them ? 
  they do just before they arrive . 
  that 's the reason of so many deaths . 
  they sink either on sight of coast guard or just before the ~ ~ sore ~ ~ shore so they ca n't be forced off the land . 
  the logistical question is more appropriate for turkey imho . 
  ah , a threat .
