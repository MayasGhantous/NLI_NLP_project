  portugal ) people keep forgetting that a lot of factors outside greece 's control during the start of the crisis lead to the final outcome . 
  ( careful , not talking up or down greece 's own fuck ups ), 
   if australia can successfully police 10 ' 000 km of ocean border , do n't tell me greece ca n't police a miserable 500km of inland sea borders . 
  it 's funny that you compare australia and greece to make your point . 
  how much of that 10 ' 000 km ocean border ( sic ) leads to a ** viable ** location for immigrants to go to ? 
  and with what distance to be covered to reach them ? 
  and how many ** viable ** entry points the aegean has ? 
  you 're comparing apples with freaking tomatoes using fancy numbers . 
   mind you that when germany wanted to send a border force in southern europe , italian and greek government where vetoing it on the grounds of sovereignty saying that financing it would be a better solution ( i do n't expect you to have heard of this in the greek media neither ) . 
  are you talking about the border force that would `` protect '' greece north borders ? 
  to keep immigrants here instead ? 
  because that 's the only proposal that was rejected and was posted here . 
  ( i do n't rely on greek media , do n't worry )  this attitude and the level of corruption is exactly why nobody takes the italian gov seriously in the eu and why merkel went straight to ankara with her euromonies bypassing the greeks . 
  yeah , merkel went with `` her '' euromonies to turkey because turkey can be trusted to do it 's job policing their own borders . 
  * sure * . 
  it 's not like that there are hundreds of known turkish smugglers that do crossings to greek islands for a living without being stopped . 
  [ it 's not like turkey allows very easily people from various countries to get an e-visa and worsen the flows towards greece .

  communism . 
  the ... low countries ? 
  care to elaborate ? 
  do n't be sorry , politicians will always be politicians . 
  beer for everyone !, 
  the issue was n't that much for immediate improvement for the average greek but for the economy not to take such a downfall that my kids will pay for those actions . 
  as i 'm paying for my parent 's actions . 
  i 'm referring more to the long term damage . 
  and when we argued ( regardless of nationality ) during the height of the `` grexit '' crisis in / r/europe against the `` bailout '' plan as it was carried on , we got attacked with arguments how greece does n't know , `` this is the only way '' and blah blah . 
   when it was decided to restructure private debt ( psi ) the `` haircut '' was great for the creditors compared to others , because `` others '' is a bit generic here i just want to mention here this includes greek banks and greek social security organisations . 
  you seem a bit confused . 
  what does greece being in eu has to do with allowing turkey to patrol our waters - all that while they ca n't stop the flow from their end - ? 
  you sound a bit bitter for some reason . 
  lol . 
  you 're welcome to stay within the u.s. borders . 
  i beg you . 
  where and from whom was that question `` raised '' ? 
  ** we offered greece new eurodac machines and greece is refusing to take our help . 
  have you thought that it was a package deal that initially was rejected because of the authority the ... inner border staff that was offered would have ? 
  you 've already separated eu and greece in your comment , let 's just blame greece completely . 
  easier . 
  how else i 'm gon na attract turkish downvotes ? 
  i kept the title of the video as close to the title by cnn and decided to just add this : on [ 1:01 ] ( https://youtu.be/bri3cfr8vki?t=61 ) he 's asked by the news anchor about turkey 's violations of greek airspace - the transcript is : question :  the greek pm accused turkey of violating greek airspace , how does nato react to that ? 
  answer :  i think we have to remember , that turkey is on the frontline of a very unstable and difficult situation in syria and ... iraq . 
  and of course for turkish to be so close on the border of all the fighting , all the killings and all the military buildup from the russian side which we 've seen there during the last weeks or months . 
  it creates a very special situation and this was not the first time , we 've seen it before . 
  beauty pageant contestant level response . 
  haha , are you for real ? 
  you showed no proof for anything besides turkey 's claims and you supported that with a book with a historic background of the aegean dispute . 
  in [ this comment of mine ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3uialx/turkish_fighter_jets_violate_greek_national_air/cxf9k2t ) there are links of wiki entries for international ** laws ** to back my comments . 
  you even invoke again international law , the law of the seas when turkey has n't signed it or follows it unless it 's in their interest . 
  the rest of the civilized world , has signed it up to an absolute majority of un members . 
  all that you 've done is throwing insults and getting personal because you ca n't back your claims . 
   go ahead and continue believing what your government is telling you . 
  i 'm sure all of the world other than greece misunderstands the international law , you confuse greece with turkey . 
  we do n't have erdogan . 
  nor a regime that kills to silence . 
  it was 1936 , not 1938 . 
  big difference . 
  [ here , i highlighted for you ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hw55rhu.jpg ) because apparently you ca n't see the previous page . 
  it invokes the law of the sea from 1936 which is n't current . 
  only turkey does n't recognize and objects to greece 's claims . 
  my sources provided enough evidence for people to see it . 
  you claim i 'm lying when i 'm quoting current international laws that your country has n't signed or wants to follow . 
  keep throwing personal insults at me and downvoting to hell , that 's your level . 
  getting agitated and showing your true colors ? 
  read your link and see that the 6nm claim from turkey is from sea of the law from 1938 . 
  not my fault you ca n't read the examples or look up the current sea of the law . 
  i guess you ca n't do a simple google search and i have to quote everything :  ** by international law , the notion of a country 's sovereign airspace corresponds with the maritime definition of territorial waters as being 12 nautical miles ( 22.2 km ) out from a nation 's coastline . 
  ** [ airspace definition ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/airspace#horizontal_boundary ) thank you for loving it . 
  sigh . 
  the fact is that we claim 10nm . 
  another fact is that you threaten with war and recognize 6nm ( for us ) . 
  a third fact is that under law we can go up to 12nm . 
  all these 3 are facts . 
  how you interpret them , is your personal opinion . 
  because turkey has threatened with war ( casus belli ) in case greece applies it 's rights and extends to 10nm ( which is what greece wants ), 
  you 're quoting a book from ** 1938 ** against the law of the sea which came in effect in ** 1994 ** , and replaced ** 1958 ** laws based on ** 1982 ** convention . 
  we have 2015 . 
  do the timeline math . 
  to give you a refreshment , about us :  in 1988 president ronald reagan issued executive proclamation 5928 , which officially increased the outer limit of u.s. territorial waters from three to twelve miles ( 54 fed . 
  this limit also applies to puerto rico , guam , american samoa , the u.s. virgin islands , and the northern mariana islands . 
  ps : i love how this book and quote exists in many comments in / r/europe . 
  propaganda strong . 
  hey neighbor , show me some sources for that ? 
  ** because , i , too , can use bold to make a claim that i 'll leave without sources ** . 
  but the truth is that [ under international law of the sea territorial waters may extend up to 12 nm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_convention_on_the_law_of_the_sea#unclos_iii ) provided that passages exist - e.g. 
  in case of many greek islands that would cutoff access to international waters . 
  the thing is , [ turkey has n't signed the convention on the law of the sea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_parties_to_the_united_nations_convention_on_the_law_of_the_sea#other_states ) ( along with some handful of countries ) therefore , it 's a bit ironic you talking about ** international laws ** i 'm talking about waters - yet , the law of the sea extends to the ** airspace ** above territorial waters . 
  edit : amazing how my replies further down are downvoted to hell . 
  erdogan 's lackeys are moving to / r/europe, 
  the dispute is n't just about airspace , but also about territorial waters and those two are connected as the violations often are used to mock and challenge by the turkish side . 
  [ there is a declared casus belli warning ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aegean_dispute#territorial_waters ) from turkey over this . 
  it all falls under the [ je m ` en fous ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zamanfou ) mentality . 
  you 've said the same thing twice in the thread , the first time was with a wikipedia link . 
  maybe you omitted it this time because of this :  in the second invasion campaign , turkish forces invaded and held on to one third of the island , resulting in effective partition of the island and secession of those parts of the island under its military control . 
  ** hence , the serving invasion is regarded as a violation of this treaty . 
  ** not to mention , the article that was `` invoked '' to justify the invasion mentioned - even in the case of a last resort unilateral action - a restoration of the status set by the treaty , not creating a new puppet state with occupying forces . 
  that 's not treaties work . 
  turkey did n't * allow * anything . 
  although i do n't agree with / u/chesterakos below , it 's not about the discipline , it 's about trust and fairness . 
  greeks never had trust to the state , it 's a complicated issue that goes way back .
