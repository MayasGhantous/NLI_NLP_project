nazi collaborator ! = evil nazi . 
  also , nazi collaborator and opportunistic nationalist are not mutually exclusive . 
  it 's not personal . 
  he 's just trying to rationalize his policies that are destroying the health system . 
  let me tell you about our own [ glorious army ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cybjguq.jpg ) . 
  another fun fact : the greek war of independence actually [ started in romania !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_war_of_independence#danubian_principalities ), 
  `` soon '' ? 
  where are they hiding ? 
  that 's a reason for holding a position , not for trying to demonise the opposite position . 
  it 's a sad truth . 
  discussion around greece 's presence in the eurozone is almost criminalised . 
   the gypsys have been caught red handed this time and who knows how many times they have done this right , the `` gypsys '' did it . 
  all of them together . 
   eastern europe gives me hope - at least whites are fighting . 
  where you norwegians were , when group of blacks raped 14 year old white girl , and she suicided after ? 
  probably eating herring with cold faces . 
  / r/europe upvoting this guy . 
  anticommunism to the rescue . 
   he wrote already in may 1942 : `` the german soldier with weapon in hand is not a man for us , but a fascist . 
  we hate him [ ... ] when the german soldier gives up his weapon and surrenders , we will not touch him with a finger - he will live . '', 
  what a monster . 
  yes . 
  for example in january an immigrant was murdered , two people were arrested and leaflets of the gd were found in their homes . 
  there was no solid proof because their connection with the party was never further investigated . 
  good answer . 
  calling the nazis left-wing is as absurd as calling the anarchists right-wing . 
  hitler was supported by the big capital and promised to support them in return and crack down the worker movement . 
  see for example the [ secret meeting of 20 february 1933 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secret_meeting_of_20_february_1933 ) . 
  it 's not the first murder , it 's the first that has been directly traced back to them . 
  they praised hitler and nazi germany in their magazine and called themselves national-socialists until 2012 when they entered the parliament and started calling themselves nationalists . 
  here are some covers of their magazine : [ 1 ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-i8u-qqwr27y/t2fdzvm1f4i/aaaaaaaaboy/1uysyvkgfha/s1600/prd_xa_aug.sept1982.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-daejlo0_vic/t16coqcfovi/aaaaaaaabgk/1b4-do-rp8a/s1600/ekswf-prd-xa_mai-ioun2007_ioul2006.jpg ) , [ 3 ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-x1besihqolc/t1-kyussj5i/aaaaaaaabjc/gxvcvjuf6nk/s1600/prd-xa_ian1987&amp;ioul1991.jpg ) . 
  calling them far-right is euphemism . 
  they are nazis . 
  dismiss the officers that have covered or cooperated with the neonazis ? 
  the title is misleading . 
  they are not going to outlaw them , they are going to outlaw their `` assault divisions '' and their criminal activity . 
  it seems that there 's proof that the order for the murder came from their leadership , from an mp specifically , so some of them will probably face charges the following days for being abbetors to the crime . 
  if there was any justice here the leadership of the golden dawn should be tried as abettors in hundreds of crimes . 
  instead , ** one day after the murder ** we have [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh9clujnmte ) , fascist thugs attacking antifascists behind the police . 
  just for you to know how deep the relations between fascists and the greek state are . 
  fuck you . 
  there is a similar topic in greece concerning gold mining in chalkidiki . 
  here 's a [ photo ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lfzkddp.jpg ) of a large demonstration in thessaloniki against mining 2 months ago . 
   what 's the difference between exchanging a bread for an egg and labour for money ? 
  the difference is that the bread can not produce new products , only labour can . 
  when you are selling your labour power you sell your ability to produce new products . 
  the problem is that the employer does not give you back the full value of your products , but keeps some for himself . 
  that 's the theft . 
   so either the people who voluntarily accept to work for somebody or the people who voluntarily accept to buy for someone are willing to be robbed ? 
  people who work for somebody accept to be robbed because they have no choice , that 's the only way they have to make money , by selling their ability to work . 
  that does n't negate the fact that part of the result of their labour is stolen . 
   tell me , when two brothers buy lemons from their aunt 's garden and sell them to their mates after school , from whom are the stealing ? 
  what part of `` trade is not theft '' did you not understand ? 
  here 's an example : i employ 10 workers that make shoes . 
  they make 100 shoes in a day . 
  i sell them for 1000 . 
  i invest 200 of them back to the company , keep 300 for myself and give 500 back to the workers for their salaries . 
  so i make money from their labour , from the value that their labour produces . 
  that 's theft . 
   that 's the abc of being a communist , and what puzzles me is how some people can be still be so stupid to believe in this shit . 
  it seems like you are ignorant and proud of it . 
  it 's late here , bye . 
  oh you really do n't get it . 
  trade is n't theft , waged labour is . 
  profit in general is n't theft , employer 's profit is though , and he does n't steal it from the consumer that buys the product but from the worker that produces it . 
  this is the abc of marxism but you still reject it knowing nothing about it . 
   admit that bourgeoisie , under the capitalist mode of production , `` created more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together '' . 
  at one point of its development , yes . 
  at least when you quote marx , use it in his own context . 
  for marx capitalism is only a historical stage of the human society that , like any other , had a beginning and will have an end . 
   even such delusional characters as karl marx marx was delusional but the bourgeois social sciences still ca n't explain where does the profit of the employer come from ( hint : it 's stolen from the worker ) . 
   capitalism is a necessary ( though not sufficient ) condition for a free society to exist capitalism can be politically more or less free , democratic or dictatorial . 
  but it 's a dictatorship in the field of economy by default . 
  anyway , i 'm still wondering why the victims of , let 's say , colonialism do not deserve to be remembered by the eu . 
  so , your point is . . ? 
  and capitalism . 
  that 's the problem with austerity . 
  it does n't reduce only the expenses , it reduces the country 's income too . 
   greece - 156.9 % [ good to see that the rescue plan is working . 
  ] ( http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ma7smgo4211qaa34so1_400.gif ), 
  59,2 % in young people ( < 25yo ) beat that , spain !, 
  heard by whom ? 
   there are still some people , that take huge income and do nothing yes , the bourgeoisie . 
  _ twist _ ... they commit suicide after freud treats them . 
  i wonder why this is getting downvoted . 
  it 's been proven that 50 % of the policemen in athens voted for the neonazis . 
  this is not the first incident of racist violence in the same area . 
  there is an ongoing campaign to boycott the companies that support these producers : #manolada #bloodstrawberries, 
  [ damn 1978 . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_greece_%281822-1978%29.svg ), 
  my father was born in 1943 . 
  greece is connected only to accountants , which is not true at all . 
  if i was to choose a profession that still can make a descent income i would say computer programmers . 
  you know that i do n't represent the greek state , do n't you ? 
  have austria faced national conflicts , ethnic cleansing and war over the last 25 years ? 
   greece should be ashamed for bullying little macedonia for all these years . 
  while i agree with this point , you should really consider that the other side is not innocent at all . 
  nikola gruevski 's nationalism does not help at all . 
  turkey has already `` helped '' cyprus enough .
