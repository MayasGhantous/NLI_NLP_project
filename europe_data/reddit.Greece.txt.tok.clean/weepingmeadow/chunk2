  fucking lazy brits , they ruin our . . erm . . greek teaching classes !, 
  oh balkans , please cut this bullshit already ... 
  nazis are cretins , end of story . 
  we are virtuous and benevolent while they are disciplined and aggresive . 
  what are we doing to defend ourselves ? 
  yes , i rememeber the colonies you are talking about . 
  i think we lost them all from those bloody romans . 
  good to see some secular thought at these hard times . 
  haha true , the title `` riot dog '' has been awarding to a few dogs in athens , but i think the one in the photo i posted is not one of them !, 
  it would be impossible to ban a large demonstration . 
  the police sometimes bans protests around important government buildings , which routinely leads to conflicts like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gcfdyte.jpg ) ( check the cool dog ) . 
  [ ok . ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wh39zotrm ), 
  original post is 03/2013 and still greece shares the same color with the uk . 
  til cyprus adopted the national anthem of greece . 
  greece is the same color as the uk and the us . 
  i wonder how accurate this is . 
  the word * greece * derives from the latin graecia , which derives from graecus , the mythological son of zeus and pandora . 
  that was adapted by the romans , though , in ancient greece `` graici '' was just a specific tribe in epirus . 
  the greek name for greece is * hellas * ( hellada in modern greek ) . 
  hellen , according to greek mythology , was the son of deukalion ( in other versions zeus ) and pyrrha and the patriarch of all greeks , after a cataclysm ( similar to the noah story ) wiped out the population of earth . 
  the word hellene ( greek ) came to mean pagan during the christianisation of the eastern roman empire and greeks adapted the name romioi ( a variation of `` romans '' ) during the middle ages and the ottoman rule . 
  the word hellas/hellene revived during the war of independence in the 1820s . 
  another interesting story is that the turkish name for `` greek '' , * yunan * , is derived from the ancient greek word ionian . 
  ancient ionia was part of the western coast of minor asia . 
  the full stories behind all these names are even more complicated , with multiple ancient sources ( such like homer , hesiodus and aristoteles ) . 
  there is a [ detailed article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/names_of_the_greeks ) in wikipedia about this . 
  noone mentioned the name ** europe ** . 
  according to greek mythology europe was the daughter of oceanus ( means ocean ) and tethys . 
  there is this famous story where zeus turned into a beautiful white bull and abducted europe , swam with her on his back to the island of crete where he revealed his true identity . 
  there is a depiction of this story in the greek version of the [ two euros coin ] ( http://i.colnect.net/images/f/1274/343/2-euro-europa-abducted-by-zeus.jpg ) . 
  greek police [ celebrated the date ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0ofztr2.jpg ) by [ invading a village ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=53mt_dzls3a# ! ), 
  and tear-gasing a school : /, 
  confirmed . 
  liberal ! = left, 
  they can hire people to fight for them . 
  it 's a political matter and it must be solved in political terms , i agree with you , except in one point :  if you take away the people 's support , golden dawn is nothing golden dawn acted like a gang before they gain popularity . 
  we need to keep the nazi gangs out of the neighbourhoods , and , as you probably already know , the police is willing to help on that . 
  bulimic on a strict diet . 
  it 's often seen as `` clashes between the two fringes '' , but what should we really do ? 
  sit back and watch the nazis gain power ? 
  big cities look like tumors o_o, 
  [ well ... ] ( http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/oct/21/turkeys-nemesis-greece-new-friend-to-israel/?page=all ), 
   partners like the troika that will buy us some time to do our reforms yeah , that will totally work . 
  apart from the later developments , with the crisis and all that . 
  the `` european identity '' in greece has always been artificial . 
  some parts of greece have been under ottoman rule for more than 5 centuries and you ca n't erase that legacy just because some politicians decided that `` greece belongs to the west '' . 
  ofcourse greeks do n't feel `` eastern '' or balkan either , \u03c4hey think they are some uninfluenced entity that fell from the sky ( while at the same time we entertain ourselves with music like [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eu__ztjd9e ) ) . 
  akel is social-democratic nowadays . 
  you see , that 's the problem with nationalism . 
  one country 's nationalism feeds the other country 's nationalism and so on . 
   painting modern greeks as `` non-greek '' or related to ancient greeks , even though university dna studies have proven the opposite when the other side makes a ridiculous claim , e.g. 
  `` we are direct descentants of [ voukefalas ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bucephalus ) '' , your response should n't be `` no , i am a direct descentant of voukefalas '' . 
  it should be `` yeah sure , whatever '' . 
  greeks have several cultural bonds to their past ( the language being the most important of them ) , but there is a serious problem with the claims on greek racial continuity . 
  most modern greek macedonians are refugees from the former ottoman empire , today 's turkey , at the early '20s ( my humble self is a good example , google `` kars '' to see where that place is ) . 
  history in our case is not neutral , it 's used as a tool for political causes . 
  that 's why disagreements between countries in our modern world should be solved in political terms , not historical or racial pseudo-scientific aspects . 
  our borders have been moulded through terrible wars that should never occur again . 
  i was born and have lived all my life in greek macedonia , currently thessaloniki . 
  yes , there are also greeks that identify themselves as macedonians , what 's the problem with that ? 
  greece 's stance in the `` fyrom problem '' is retarded as well . 
  everybody is calling them macedonians , get over it . 
   sorry but putting greece in the same category as russia/mexico is crazy ... that ... and egypt ? 
  wtf ? 
  egypt had 800 + deaths during the 2011 uprising . 
  the violent protests in greece that were overexposed by the western media had only one incident that resulted to 3 deaths when some retarted hooligans burnt down a bank . 
  do some research , greece is safe for tourists . 
  i will constantinople the shit out of you , biatch . 
   this guy is talking about kozani , his jurisdiction . 
  the context implies that he is talking about the whole operation . 
  `` i want to thank all the personel that cooperated for the persecution , the officer that directed the operation , the officer from imathia and all the personel that really put their lives in danger in order to arrest them without having any injuries or any other problem '' . 
  i do n't see how the `` 4 arrested but only 3 tortured '' is an argument for anything . 
  the case still makes sense . 
  the police officers that directed the operation talked to the media right after the events , ** before ** the public outcry for the photoshopped photos emerged . 
  they state that there was not a conflict but only a disarmament during the arrest . 
  the 3 robbers had probably light injured during the arrest , but were brutally tortured later . 
  the supposed investigation on this , done by the police , is a joke . 
  the last time when the greek police `` investigated '' itself , it concluded that a random guy [ heavily beaten ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-erbfofdou7g/txzowdtlrli/aaaaaaaaa6g/sdvmatrqho8/s1600/augoustinos-dimitriou-01.jpg ) by secret policemen was ... injured by a flowerpot . 
  here is the video ( in greek ) : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ulfwduakas edit : at 10:00 he says `` i want to ~ ~ help ~ ~ thank our personel for managing to arrest them without having any injuries or any other problem '' . 
  not exactly the same . 
  because everybody knows that big corporations , especially the military industries , have absolutely no relations with any government . 
  that would make sense if it was n't germany that sold these submarines in the first place . 
  this comment is legit . 
  ok , greek here . 
  this article is a huge misinformation . 
  the nazi rally did not have tens of thousands participants . 
  it 's considered a major failure by everyone here , except themselves ofcourse . 
  * the police ( widely friendly to the neonazis ) estimation was ** 3,000 ** protesters . 
  * `` proto thema '' , a major political newspaper , also friendly to the neonazi party posted [ this photo ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-csrsgckyb2s/uq576puicri/aaaaaaaafxq/xnha1w7ts14/s1600/09197047bca7bb687286aa32cec5abe9.jpg ) from their demonstration . 
  they are not enough to take over both streams of the street . 
  * in their own website , [ this ] ( http://www.xryshaygh.com/resources/images/news/imia-05.jpg ) is the best photo they could post . 
  it 's a close panoramic photo of the small square they used for their protest and as you can see that 's a few thousands . 
  * the demo is even smaller from a demo they organised in 2010 , when their party had < 0,50 % in the elections . 
  50,000 was just their own ridiculous estimation . 
  please fellow redditors , stop advertising the neonazis , we have enough problems already . 
  it 's called `` revolution '' when it 's done by the people . 
  when it 's done by the army it 's called `` coup '' . 
  i am . 
  the government is clearly and openly promoting a far-right agenta to distract the people from their economic problems and to blame the immigrants , the left etc etc. 
  the immigration policies of the government is exactly the same with golden dawn 's agenta , imprisoning immigrants in concentration camps etc.
