  i 'm betting ( at least ) 50,000 by sunday midnight . 
  awkward jokes about that cameron sex revelation ? 
  um , dude , i do n't think you want our pm on your side for a negotiation ... 
  i 'd say i 'm in except it involves hearing all the songs ... 
  and yet still not as bad as rakintzis !, 
  [ a bit more context ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/207050/article/ekathimerini/community/refugee-conditions-in-greece-deteriorating-says-angelina-jolie ), 
  i sincerely hope you had that text ready for copy/paste and did n't come up with all of that just now . 
  when i first heard about this debacle from twitter i imagined he had was just reading the thread on his phone during the interview , hence the blunder, 
  your last sentence is reddit in a nutshell . 
  ... i laughed . 
  then i gave you a shameful upvote . 
  thanks for the tips !, 
  i really need to get around visiting crete sometime . 
  well yes , lots of shops have fosters , how is this news ? 
  yeah , were you meant to post a picture mate ? 
  did n't see the original post . 
  my twitter feed kind of exploded over this . 
  apparently this is the main dissenting voice against erdogan 's government . 
  journalists are tweeting they 're preparing their ` last issue ' ( as in of free speech ) . 
  i 'd love to hear turkish redditor perspectives on this . 
  really , in english ? 
  that sounds strange to me . 
  everything is subtitled in greece ( except cartoons ) but the subtitles are greek . 
  nazi cunts . 
  my nephew got named ypatios . 
  old men names are a plague . 
  now that would be a name to be saddled with . 
  picturing some mum yelling ` agamemnonaki ' at the playground . 
  an english friend of mine was astonished that i have friends named olympia and penelope . 
  they 're rather common names . 
  i 've met a few socratis , achilleas and odysseas over the years too . 
  ah , shows my ignorance . 
  those sound delicious too . 
  and i think i will pm , 
  seriously . 
  journalism at its finest !, 
  it 's absolutely gorgeous and i had a fantastic time , but i rather enjoy the madness of london . 
  well your flair threw me . 
  i was surprised by how tasty black pudding is . 
  i expected it to be very fatty and tasteless , but the good stuff has a very complex , satisfying flavour ( still too unhealthy , but damn , it tastes good ) . 
  i was recently in yorkshire and had a proper yorkshire pudding . 
  makes the london ones look pathetic ... 
  french food is phenomenal . 
  i particularly love tartiflette , onion soup and confit de canard . 
  anything italian , really . 
  i love the simpler pasta dishes ( not the ` drowning in cream ' international intepretation ) , and i 've found rather tasty napolitan-style pizza in london . 
  i 'm going to barcelona this summer , so i 'm very much looking forward to all the tasty chorizo , paella and all the tapas !, 
  tartiflette is the bomb . 
  i 've made it a few times , though not with lard . 
  the best ones are in santorini if you ever go . 
  a variety of news sites , reddit and for greek news i have a twitter list of journalists and commentators . 
  yes . 
  they were delicious . 
  this makes me very happy i opted to celebrate nye by having some friends for drinks / food at home . 
  yeah , my friend is catalan and she was telling me . 
  even had a fucked up kids book where the kids beat the log so that it ... shits the gifts out of sheer terror ? 
  you mean that mini cocktail sausage ? 
  yes , and it 's taught as fiction . 
  actually , no . 
  from their pov al qaeda are filthy casuals . 
  a very well researched article on the subject : [ what isis really wants ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/03/what-isis-really-wants/384980/?utm_source=sffb ), 
  it 's not his best work , and i normally like oliver . 
  so did you use this post to take a random dig at the economic crisis in greece or did someone give you that greek phrase as an accurate translation ? 
  as the leader of the opposition ? 
  how ? 
  the whole tweet , in context : `` we await identification of the person targeted in last night 's us air attack in syria . 
  it appears mohammed emwazi has been held to account for his brutal and callous crimes . 
  however , it would have been far better for us all if he had been held to account in a court of law . 
  these events only underline the necessity of accelerating international efforts , under the auspices of the un , to bring an end to the syrian conflict as part of a comprehensive regional settlement . '', 
  or their teens . 
  18 year old me in a uk uni got quite a shock upon being informed those teen girls with prams were not , in fact , babysitting their siblings, 
  whenever i 'm back in greece from london , i always weird out the shop keeps by saying please and thank you too much ( read : at all ) . 
  i also had a bizarre reaction of a friend looking at me like i 'd grown a second head when i suggested we meet for a drink at 7pm . 
  anything earlier than 9/10 makes you a day drinker with an alcohol problem . 
  also , though this is more of a london thing than a uk thing , i nearly cried when i went to my mum 's apartment because of how huge it seemed . 
  but then , my bulgarian friend tells me london people think she 's some kind of millionaire because her flat in sofia is 80 square meters . 
  i also got people randomly talking english to me because they assumed only a tourist would walk around in sandals and a sleeveless top in late october . 
  it was 25 degrees !!, 
  yes i did . 
  that 's what happens when i post after only one coffee i still have n't read it , embarrassingly . 
  i read a lot of his books when i was 14 , and it was a bit too heavy for me at the time . 
  i should get on that . 
  the iliad and odyssey something more recent , anything by nikos kazantzakis ( who happened to have translated the odyssey into modern greek ) . 
  my personal favourite is [ christ recrucified ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christ_recrucified ) though he 's more known abroad for zorba ( because of the film ) and the last temptation of the christ because of the controversy . 
  as [ u/tundur ] ( / u/tundur ) said , there is n't really a ` dating ' culture in most european countries ( that seems to be changing a bit with online dating sites or even tinder ) . 
  generally people do the deed and fall into a relationship , or just skip part b. 
  and obviously while details vary a lot between western/eastern/northern europe etc , a lot of the things i see referenced on reddit ( having the ` exclusivity talk ' / x number of dates before sex/having to plan really elaborate and expensive dates/the friendzone , among others ) are not really a thing . 
  not sure whether it 's a thing in the us style or whether it is a reflection of the typical redditor who might not be the best authority on courtship rituals . 
  the weird , rigid rules and extreme stereotypes involved in us-style ` dating ' . 
  thanks !, 
  i 'm embarrassed to say i have n't been to zagorohoria , but friends ' pics always blew my mind . 
  i 'm kicking myself as i 'm abroad now and it 's harder to pop over . 
  [ zagorohoria ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=zagorohoria&amp;es_sm=93&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=795&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cdaqsarqfqotckyr6ddv-8gcfcttggodgcqjiq#tbm=isch&amp;q=zagorohoria+hike&amp;imgrc=-yfifvwetxrrmm%3a ) a selection of villages with stunning views and diverse hike trails . 
  for a more unusual hike , [ meteora ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=zagorohoria&amp;es_sm=93&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=795&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cdaqsarqfqotckyr6ddv-8gcfcttggodgcqjiq#tbm=isch&amp;q=meteora+hike ) is worth a go-it 's the one with the monasteries growing out of mountains . 
  a lot of islands are good hiking destinations . 
  i ca n't recommend specifics because i 'm more of a ` ie in the beach and just swim to get my daily exercise ' kind of girl . 
  that might have been the case when the coast guard was doing ( highly illegal ) pushbacks . 
  the coast guard is not even there most of the time ( too many boats ) . 
  there is literally no reason for people to risk drowning or hypothermia , especially those on the wooden boats ( they are more expensive as they are perceived as safer , and therefore have a disproportionate amount of elderly , children , women etc ), 
  actually [ the upper deck of the boat broke off ] ( http://www.itv.com/news/2015-10-29/what-we-know-about-latest-migrant-boat-sinking-off-greek-island-of-lesbos/ ) , but hey , let 's not let facts get in the way of circle jerking , eh ?
