  i do n't think it would . 
  it would mean that germany has to admit that the griechenlandrettung was a joke . 
  it would mean that now germany has to help greece for real , as now reforming can be done because there will be nothing left . 
  amidst the recent politcal climate , this is political suicide for merkel and schaeuble . 
  and not only cb analysis for greece . 
  globally it would be a disaster . 
  * let 's exchange for some trees *, 
  you make it sound like its an easy thing to do . 
  to leave the ez , there needs to be almost complete debt write off and economic help . 
  otherwise you would have a economic and subsequently humanitarian catastrophe, 
  that 's true . 
  but on the other hand it 's like saying `` oh , they do n't do as we please , which is quite distressing for us . 
  let 's put a gun on their head '' . 
  it just shows there are no talks happening between greece and creditors , there are just orders and threats, 
  would you say really `` the majority '' ? 
  would n't the * western * part being much smaller than the eastern , rural part explain the current situation and all the admiration from erdogans people ? 
  barely anyone was aware of it . 
  thanks to erdoyawn for pointing this out, 
  i am equally disgusted and impressed by your comment, 
  more about it http://typographica.org/on-typography/roof-kerning-in-amsterdam/, 
  yea clearly we should try harder, 
  here is a list of at least what i expect : - stop blaming greece for what is happening - actively help greece and turkey on their borders and start filtering out people who really need help and bring them in an organized manner to germany or any other country - put pressure on turkey to handle part of the situation - explore and invest on other options in building housings or even entire settlements in turkey or anywhere for refugees to be save ( um , sounds a bit utopian , but one can dream ), 
  question is : was the haircut bigger than the interest they got ? 
  eitherway , whatever happened , it was for the benefit of the banks . 
  that 's the announcement of varoufakis new movement in case you were not aware . 
  lets have a constructive discussion . 
  edit : you can watch it here in case you missed it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cd4owt05-zm, 
  this is so old , it makes me feel like i should look for a life insurance, 
  greeks do the same , but on one film they manage to spoil the ending the shawshank redemption -  \u03a4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03b1\u03af\u03b1 \u03ad\u03be\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 : \u03a1\u03af\u03c4\u03b1 \u03a7\u03ad\u03b9\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5\u03bf\u03c1\u03b8 -  last exit : rita hayworth sadly r/europe does n't allow spoiler tags :(, 
  nevermind  it could be interpreted as `` all people that speak greek are idiots '' but ignore me, 
  do i get an underlying meaning in what you just said ? 
  oh god , the woman that talks is most probably the greek equivalent for oprah ( \u03a4\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1 \u03a3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5 ) , probably a lot worse and annoying than her . 
  really annoying voice, 
  what you described as autocracy sounds like any western government to me . 
  i did n't see him labeling it as `` left-wing '' and could n't find anything like that on the announcement . 
  yes , full body scans and metal detectors . 
  thats exactly what i want to experience before every concert, 
  i know a lot of non-sensible , hot-headed people and i would n't like the idea of them being able to aquire a weapon . 
  free access to weapons would only make it easier for everybody to create such situations like tonight . 
  oh my ... there come the ridiculous opinions, 
  once most jobs are replaced by robots and most people will be unemployed , you will be the first one to feel the rage . 
  the way the uk government is propagating their beliefs ( cut benefits , everybody should work ) there will be huge problems ahead that will affect everybody, 
  2016 must have been the weirdest year of all . 
  stay tuned for the showdown tonight, 
  if it 's wrong it should be forbidden !, 
  the moment it is not , the lawmaker is as guilty about what happened as the offender is, 
   most of the bank bailout money went to greek banks to prevent a systemic meltdown of the greek banking system . 
  and subsequently a meltdown of european banks, 
  well , i think the music was n't dramatic enough , i am not convinced, 
  worse . 
  this surplus looks good on the screen , but it has been made on the back of the less fortunate , whether it be normal middle class citizen or mid-sized companies . 
  those are the ones that are dying one after the other in order to achieve this . 
  while we do balance the budget nicely , there are people not planning anymore to have a family or to open a business and achieve anything that would develop our state further . 
  thus i think such a budget might not be sustainable in an ever shrinking country . 
  sounds more like a `` good cop bad cop '' approach , both following the same trail . 
  germany has been the `` bad cop '' before , so they are now playing it nice . 
  i do n't see how they would have any benefit on being soft with the uk, 
  beautiful city , visited many times and have wondeful memories !, 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/14/jean-claude-juncker-denies-alcohol-problem-during-interview-in-w/ i do n't know if he has an alcohol problem and i do n't care , but this is reddit so we do make jokes ( and circlejerk ) from time to time, 
  let 's see if it 's early enough for him to not be drunk, 
  you need cause you got to pay those taxhikes, 
  this feels good - i want to see him burn ( not literally ), 
   * only *, 
  is that the state television ? 
  geographically yes, 
  erdogan is the european kim jong un it seems . 
  not sure if funny or scary, 
  a gas leak ? 
  i ca n't imagine what would happen if a whole team gets involved into a terrible accident . 
  til there are national flowers !, 
  what national thing else is there that i do n't know ? 
  already sent the bill to aunty merkel, 
  organized ( more people involved ) vs. not organized ( just a random psycho ), 
  this is not supposed to be a statistically accurate map, 
  the eu is actually working hard to achieve an imbalance to attract skilled and unskilled staff to larger economies ( see the whole southern to northern europe migration ) . 
  wages have fallen drastically in those countries due to austerity, 
  so where is the catch ? 
  did lots of people leave the country ? 
  lots of contract and part-time work ? 
  i am actually happy with the responses here  it would be definitely good for us, 
  or any uk worker in any eu country and any eu citizen in the uk . 
  what a shitshow, 
  re : video linked not everybody is married to a german or resided in 20 years in germany , so not much of a comfort for them, 
  all of that while you might have to pay for all the damage ( uncertainty of market , companies running away from the uk ), 
  you are absolutely right . 
  still the way the `` leave '' campaign stated this information was purposefully to deceive the public that the money will go straight into nhs , despite the actual working not saying any of that . 
  farrage had nothing to do with that though, 
  i find it hard to believe 1 + million people had that thought, 
  they have no plan, 
  whoever will be alive by then, 
  yes but their economy is bigger because they rely a lot on the economic relations with the eu . 
  the problem with someone leaving that club is instability , something you would n't have if you never been a member in the first place . 
  switzerlands economy grew organically ( with some help of their fin businesses ) , uk needs to somehow navigate to there , and it will take time . 
  all the uncertainty caused now will cost them though, 
  i am starting to feel sorry for the folks there, 
  same with greek . 
  her voice sounds bland, 
  i wonder how much this will prevent anything . 
  these people must be severely intoxicated to do what they do, 
  i am glad our lord schaeuble is happy with our progress .
