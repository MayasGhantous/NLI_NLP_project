no , i 'm not supporting it . 
  this is like opening pandora 's box . 
  well , tbh i really can understand germany : it has in no way been setup ( after ww2 ) to lead europe . 
  and this shows . 
  the luger was fun . 
  still remember the very nice anatomical grip it had . 
  yes . 
  i 'm from crete and literally everyone there owns ( illegally ) a gun . 
  i 've fired : sig sauer , beretta , ak-47 and a luger from ww2 . 
  ps : during my army service , i 've also fired with the heckler & koch g3/a3 . 
  is this the same aguirre as in werner herzog 's movie `` aguirre , wrath of god '' ? 
   i know about that yalta napkin , we were the 90 percent su influence who put greece in the western world , by 90 percent margin . 
  [ here is the actual napkin , in churchills handwriting ] ( http://cassidyglobalcoldwar.weebly.com/uploads/5/0/6/9/50698393/859250969.jpg ) . 
  [ here ] ( http://cassidyglobalcoldwar.weebly.com/percentage-deal.html ) a more readable version . 
  well , hindsight is 20/20 and back then the situation was really complicated . 
  communists started the resistance against the nazi occupation of greece ( other non-communist groups joined them at some point ) . 
  after the german occupation , the communists saw themselves as the legitimate rulers of greece with which other groups naturally disagreed ( e.g. 
  the exiled government of greece ) . 
  at some point the communists were controlling all of greece except the syntagma square in athens but they still managed to lose . 
  this led churchill to visit athens , while ww2 was still ongoing . 
   how can a greek not thank the heavens every single day his country remained with the usa after the war ? 
  one reason for this is probably because of what happened after the civil war . 
  after the civil war , when the right wing won , a pogrom started against all communists or anyone having any relationship with a communist . 
  the greek communist party was outlawed ( it was legalized again in 1974 ) . 
  communists went on trial and were exiled ( to islands such as [ makronisos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/makronisos ) and [ gyaros ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gyaros ) most notable example is mikis theodorakis ) or executed ( most prominent example is [ nikos beloyannis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nikos_beloyannis ) which caused an international campaign against his death sentence led by prominent figures such as charlie chaplin , jean paul sartre , pablo picasso . 
  beloyannis is depicted in picasso 's sketch called `` man with the carnation '' ) . 
  if you had any relationship with communists ( sibling , brother , father , cousin etc ) , you were basically outcast : you could not study , could not get any work . 
  my father in law for example , had to change his name in order to be able to study in greece , because his father was member of the communist resistance group during ww2 . 
  my uncle had to study in italy because one of his aunt was married to a communist and no greek university would accept him . 
  that leaves deep scars in a big part of society . 
  do n't get me wrong : i 'm not trying to portray communists as the good persons here ; i 'm just trying to say that there was a great divide in society and the situation was really complicated for at least 3 decades after the civil war . 
  yes , greece had a [ civil war from 1946 to 1949 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_civil_war ) . 
  in essence , right and left ( communists ) wing fought over who will rule greece after ww2 . 
  right wing won , but until today the issue is still not completely resolved . 
  yes , sounds funny in german as well !, 
  i saw the movie in german in the early 80s ( `` hasch mich , ich bin der m\u00f6rder '' ) when i was in germany . 
  in greece , he is known , but i would n't say that he is popular in the way he is in germany . 
  it 's a pity though because i always found his explosive character super funny . 
  i guess you mean the `` non !, 
  dialog ? 
  in crete , we have the love story of erotokritos and aretousa , which is the central theme of [ `` erotokritos '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/erotokritos ) a poem written by vikentios kornaros in the early 17th centrury . 
  the poem is today still [ very popular in crete and verses of this poem are sung on almost any occasion ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldslpkmwu4s ) . 
  i live in the western part of greece ( mainland ) . 
  up until now nothing has changed and daily life goes on as usual . 
  but we 're way off their main route . 
  do n't know whether they plan to set up refugee camps here though . 
  di you have a reference for this ? 
  because leaving an island requires a ship and as far as i know they do register while boarding . 
  it 's perfect . 
  this scene http://youtu.be/4uv6hvmrmdk, 
  the proper way is like [ this ] ( http://www.ypaithros.gr/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/%ce%bf%cf%8d%ce%b6%ce%bf-696x522.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://www.athinorama.gr/lmnts/articles/2005083/ouzo4.jpg ) . 
  and definitely like [ this ] ( http://www.greek-islands.us/lesvos/ouzo.jpg ) !, 
  first thing that comes to mind is the gem\u00fctlichkeit with which they socialize . 
  it permeates the social life in austria in coffee houses , restaurants etc . 
  have n't seen this in any other german speaking country and i liked it very much . 
  me too !, 
  in greece christmas preparations starts also rather early ( mid/end november ) and follows more or less the pattern of other western christian countries in terms of commercialization . 
  in religious terms though , easter is a much , much bigger event than christmas with all the appropriate festive celebrations . 
  this includes the traditional [ spit-roasted lamb ] ( http://image.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/157912/157912,1303858633,3/stock-photo-lamb-roasting-on-a-spit-for-the-greek-easter-76027930.jpg ) , the [ burning of judas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burning_of_judas ) and in some parts ( e.g. 
  island of chios ) you may see [ rocket wars ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pijfpzx88i ) . 
  me too . 
  lived there some time and liked it very much . 
  well , this was the referendum question in greece on june 25 , 2015 , on which we all had to vote : '' * should the plan of agreement be accepted , which was submitted by the european commission , the european central bank , and the international monetary fund in the eurogroup of 25.06.2015 and comprises of two parts , which constitute their unified proposal ? 
  the first document is entitled ` reforms for the completion of the current program and beyond ' and the second ` preliminary debt sustainability analysis * '', 
  that 's interesting !, 
  thanks . 
  is spain 's congress of deputies the place where the 1981 attempted coup d'\u00e9tat occured , [ shown in this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcc0_8i0cys ) ? 
  greece - public spending . 
  interesting observation . 
  looking at the history of central europe , i personally always thought that it was a rather reasonable consequence to host major official eu seats - like european commission , council of the european union , and european council - in brussels . 
  in the past , that area has really seen some tough sh * t. 
  in general you 're right . 
  that 's why i say it 's a `` sentiment '' rather than an strong opinion like in say catalonia . 
  crete was united with greece in 1913 . 
  from 1898 until 1913 it was more of less a separate state ( or more precisely it was an autonomous part of the ottoman empire ) called the '' [ cretan state ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cretan_state ) '' . 
  there is today a general sentiment among the population that crete should or could be independent . 
  there was even a [ movement that in 2012 was advocating a referendum ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2012/01/28/is-2012-the-year-cretans-decide-if-they-want-out-from-greece/ ) to separate from greece . 
  but tbh i 'm not sure how the population views such official movements . 
   was it up to greece to defeat the third reich ? 
  oh no , wait , they were just supposed to sacrifice themselves and millions of their citizens to make a point , right ? 
  imho , what greece did wrt italy and germany during wwii are among the few things that make me proud being greek . 
  it tried to do what it could do . 
  and with respect to italy it scored the first victory against the axis . 
  if you ask me , that 's not bad for a small country . 
  i 'm sorry but just to make this clear : are you suggesting that had greece joined the axis , this would have saved greece 's jewish population ? 
  edit : forgot `` saved '', 
  well , ca n't we then claim europa as our first extraterrestrial colony ? 
  did n't they have an insider that would give bild the news ? 
  i think at some point even lothar matth\u00e4us was working that way for bild . 
  i definitely agree with that . 
  i 've also problems in conceiving the term `` good journalism '' in today 's world . 
  i do n't think that he calls it `` journalism '' . 
  he emphasizes this :  gewisser journalistischer praktiken anyway , bild is imho a different kind of beast . 
  personally i strongly resist calling it a newspaper and what they do as journalism . 
  i do n't know how to call it but it 's not journalism . 
  basketball and football . 
  ca n't really choose one . 
  both are immensely popular . 
  we have them as well . 
  `` shitty posh '' is quite accurate actually ...
