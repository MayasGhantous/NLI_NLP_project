  but that means you 'll never experience what it is like to hear the real voice of say marlon brando in the godfather movies , al pacino 's and robert de niro 's voice in heat , clint eastwood 's voice in dirty harry etc. 
  granted , germany has imho almost perfected dubbing but can you imagine say seeing j\u00fcrgen prochnow as `` der alte '' or herbert gr\u00f6nemeyer or martin semmelrogge in `` das boot '' and not speaking german ? 
  i think that would take away something from their respective roles . 
  the stone on the right of the lamppost has a pretty nice inscription : `` for peace freedom and democracy never again fascism million of dead admonish '', 
   all because some bavarians are pissed about traffic jams during the summer time . 
  are these traffic jams that bad ? 
   but can anyone say a bad thing about austria ? 
  nope !, 
  that 's why they say : bella gerant alii , tu felix austria nube . 
  btw our current minister of health is an md and smoking ( everywhere ) . 
  [ here he is smoking ] ( http://static.in.gr/webstatic/2cc070bd83ac54824a558d213ac18077.jpg ) inside the ministry during a press conference - the sign behind him reads `` ministry of health '' ) . 
  they have surplus but it 's definitely not huge . 
  surprised to see that you mention aegean in your list.i 've flown aegean many times and am always very satisfied . 
  but are they at the level of uae or lufthansa ? 
  not in every country . 
  in greece for example , this did n't happen . 
  in fact most collaborators joined the civil war on the side of the government fighting against communists . 
  greece still struggles with that issue . 
  and he is doing it properly , [ according to this tutorial ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-8gswzqdbm ) . 
  [ october 28 is also a public holiday ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_holidays_in_greece ) in greece . 
  they mostly sell jewellery , watches and fashion accessories , not so much clothes . 
  they have a presence in some european countries ( e.g. 
  uk , france , spain ) and asia . 
  i think it 's `` augschpurg '' , 
   well greece since joining eu in 1986 ( if i 'm correct ) greece joined the eu in 1981 . 
  o wow . 
  he 's doing his revolution i guess . 
  always has this question : is his comb-style deliberate ? 
  edit : his instead of this . 
  yes . 
  but sch\u00e4uble on the other played the bad cop pretty well . 
  merkel often tried to alleviate sch\u00e4uble 's statements . 
  it 's a perfect duo imho . 
  why is it that all bad greek guys are called stavros ? 
  you probably forgot the church of crete , which is semi-autonomous under the jurisdiction of the ecumenical patriarchate of constantinople . 
  even in the early-mid 80s - when i was a teenager - metal was very popular in greece . 
  still remember many of my classmates were huge into it . 
  no but sounds interesting . 
  the wine is not for sale though : it 's just for his own and the family 's needs . 
  yup . 
  my father makes his own wine ( and so does everyone in my village in crete ) . 
  exactly . 
  they are delicious . 
  nowadays it 's `` do you have enough money for ____ ? '', 
  insert really anything above : internet , food , drinks , clothing , mobile phone , gyro etc, 
  looks like greeks are pyromaniacs ? 
  at my university there 's a wall which has written on it : `` the only university that enlightens is the one that burns '' o_o, 
  the name `` meteora '' means actually hovering . 
  the word `` meteor '' has the same meaning . 
  wine made from riesling grapes are always one of my favorites !, 
  i would like also to visit mongolia . 
  a place with such kind of music http://youtu.be/p_5yt5ix38i must be epic . 
  btw was n't bulgaria before wwi nicknamed as `` prussia of the balkans '' due to their victories and rapid economic growth ? 
  i would highly recommend to you henry petroski 's book `` to engineer is human : the role of failure in successful design '' . 
   joseph goebbels delivered his sportpalast speech for me , probably the most scary speech in history . 
  still remember l\u00f6wenzahn . 
  peter lustig was a cool guy !, 
  augsburg is such a beautiful city !, 
  lived there for many years long time ago . 
  still remember that augsburg has one holiday that applies within the city limits only . 
  i think it 's called peace festival celebrating the peace of westphalia in 1648 . 
  i do n't know if this was just my experience but streets were empty after 21h which i found nice actually . 
  lol seems so !, 
   until you remember vanitousis in greece maybe you mean varoufakis here ? 
  must be the view from the electra palace hotel in thessaloniki . 
  remember that view when i had breakfast , 
  i think it was paralyzed by a gunshot wounds . 
  lepanto is a small greek town that today is called [ nafpaktos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nafpaktos ) although lepanto is also used . 
  nafpaktos [ has a statue of cervantes ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/dslewis/4157694379/ ) in the old venetian harbor , as a memorial to his participation in the battle of lepanto . 
  sure , that 's an absolutely correct observation . 
  but on the other , if someone asked me in 1945 , who would live until the 2000s the personal secretary of hitler or a randomly chosen secretary i would probably say the latter taking into consideration the treatment junge would have got from the allies and the stigmatization . 
  again that just my naive reasoning . 
  what strikes me is the fact that people that were very close to high ranking nazi officials lived so long : traudl junge died in 2002 at age 81 , leni riefenstahl died in 2003 aged 101 . 
  not only that but he also seems to put the eu on par with former soviet union . 
  yes , i too like that album a lot . 
  septic flesh is definitely worth a try ( although i think they spell their name nowadays as septicflesh ) . 
  yup , it 's quite popular here with a lot of bands . 
  rotting christ , septic flesh , firewind , necromantia are some of the most popular ones . 
  sure . 
  but i meant that traudl junge herself appears in the film . 
  the person speaking at the beginning of the video i linked to is gertraud junge ( i think it 's from an earlier interview ) . 
  what strikes me the most is the fact that she is still alive . 
  there are many people who were very close to high ranking nazi officials that lived quite long ; traudl junge for example comes to mind , hitler 's last personal secretary , who died in 2002 and [ appears briefly in the movie `` der untergang '' ] ( https://youtu.be/stlaxpmvyvg?t=22s ) . 
  but it 's enough to look wealthier than the robbers . 
  it was bombed during wwii mainly because there were many factories like the man factory that made ( and still makes i think ) diesel engines for ships and submarines ( btw the a in man refers to augsburg ) . 
  during these bombings the town hall which [ had the golden hall ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/augsburg_town_hall#/media/file:goldener_saal-augsburg.jpg ) was completely destroyed . 
  was living in augsburg many years back . 
  it 's a very beautiful town . 
  hope everything goes well !, 
  is n't also heinrich boell 's book `` die verlorene ehre der katharina blum '' actually referring to bild ? 
  iirc boell himself said that the newspaper mentioned in that book is bild . 
  she was quite famous in greece . 
   and as usual , the whole greece did nothing wrong schtick . 
  they never did , apparently greece did a lot of things wrong . 
  but i do n't think that 's the point here . 
  the issue here is quite specific : german officials say there were no eurodac data for this person . 
  greece says there were . 
  btw i do n't like this finger-pointing game at all . 
  yup , valid point . 
  otoh , if there is no hell , then it 's really forever :(,
