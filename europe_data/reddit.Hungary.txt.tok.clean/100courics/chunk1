uh-oh it 's better to summarize the situation like this : we have seven neighbors , only two of which we no longer have any land claims ( slovenia & croatia ) . 
  pre-wwii european architecture was absolutely stunning . 
  it 's a shame that so much of it was destroyed . 
  in capitals like prague , bratislava and budapest , we now see such beautiful buildings combined with the ugly blockhouses of socialist realism . 
  it 's a damn shame . 
  in our capital , they were supposed to `` temporarily '' house a few hundred thousand for no more than fifteen years . 
  and here they stand , almost seventy years later . 
  man i wish we could get rid of that crap already . 
  for anyone who wants to check out the nightlife , go to the five-story club in prague . 
  went to that place three years ago with friends ; one of the greatest times i had outside my own state . 
  as its name implies , there are several stories , each with its own party . 
  it 's weird , too ; during the day , the building it 's located in is like a market and a museum . 
  we had no idea how we were supposed to find this club we heard about . 
  when we went back at night , boom !, 
  there it was , true to its name . 
  expect club prices on beer ; also , go there with girls \\ boys ahead . 
  dont creep on girls there : one girl smashed a fucking beer mug in an english guy 's face when he tried for the third or fourth time to score . 
  nyt writing the one-sided pov like it usually does . 
  hungary was no angel , but jews fled to hungary from the entire region because it was the only state which did n't send them to the concentration camps all the way until mid-1944 when a german-backed coup took place in the regime . 
  ffs at least mention both sides of historical events . 
  nobody say anything, 
  i 'm sure there are going to be tons of comments of general changes , so i just want to highlight one : the change of the uk 's status regarding the eu 's `` internal market '' . 
  the uk is not a net beneficiary from the eu 's budget , one of the chief reasons for its euroskepticism . 
  however , i can only assume that british companies make up several times that amount through profits on the continent thanks to removal of tariffs and trade barriers . 
  if the uk leaves the eu , it could still request to be in the european economic area to have access to the internal market . 
  however , it would then still have to have its laws compatible with eu regulations - another driving force behind euroskepticism . 
  if the uk wanted to remain in the eea , it would still have to hear brussels 's nagging it dreads so much . 
  if the uk left altogether , several of its industries may severely contract due to the elimination of an entire free trade area from its prospects . 
  britain was always better off in this sense from the continent , because it had an empire and then a commonwealth to stick with , as well as its bff status with the us . 
  still , i 'd think twice about a move like that if i were them ... 
  give us roughly 150 years worth of reparations for being the executioners of our freedom three times . 
  massive issues transcending classes countrywide --  mainstream parties lose credibility for failing to solve them --  new party can claim to have a solution which ca n't be refuted since it has not yet been in power --  new party is elected since , by not having been in power , it did the least amount of damage to the state 's economy . 
  it has been a well-applied formula over the past two centuries . 
  the only variation is the outcome ( whether its solution actually works or not ) . 
  master trolling right there, 
  well in our case many of the stadiums were built from public funds rather than sponsorship even though most people wouldve preferred something like infrastructure renewal/construction . 
  focusing a football fields is a classic communist tactic to keep the people ( mostly right-wingers ) content . 
  or at least that was the situation here . 
  i thought the stupid shit our leader did was n't contagious . 
  assemble peace in the middle east with 12 easy steps, 
  lies !, 
  i see no moose, 
  umm [ ceu ] ( http://www.ceu.hu/academics/degrees/masters ) is the most notable economics school from here . 
  i do n't know if any of its grad programs are explicitly political economy-based , but i thought i 'd post it anyways . 
  hope it helps, 
   i dont really know a lot about tibor navracsics , but if he is a fidesz member , then he is for sure a good guy !, 
  wow , guilt by association - a truly democratic move right there . 
  do you really want to go down this road ? 
  daniel cohn-bendit has been linked to acts of pedophilia . 
  should we then assume that the entire green coalition in the ep is made of pedophiles , because they wo n't distance themselves from him ? 
  how about you , when knowing nothing about a political party and google it , leave these things to the people living under these parties who can draw proper conclusions on the character of individual politicians  edit : once again , some members of the tolerant community have shown that they prefers self-righteous twats who know nothing about the topic they dive into over logical arguments so long as they agree with them . 
  well done . 
  tibor navracsics is n't anti-semitic , i have no idea where you got that from . 
  seeing as many of his colleagues are jewish i do n't know how that would work . 
  he is actually one of the extremely few logical members of the governing coalition . 
  this `` question '' was filled with hatred ; comparing wass to hitler just showed that this person had 0-10 % of an idea of what he was talking about . 
  the amount of butthurt in his spewing of hatred actually made me uncomfortable for a moment to see that he is in position to ask any kind of questions . 
  tl ; dr navracsics is n't anti-semitic and questioner has absolutely no idea what he 's talking about . 
  the first picture would be hilarious if there was a `` justin bieber concert '' caption to it,

  you da real mvp, 
  the slovaks are going to be pissed when they find out we share yet another word, 
  that has since been amended to a maximum ceiling of 700huf/month ( which of course everyone is going to reach , so it 's not really a `` maximum '' , rather the `` regular '' ) .

  i lost my shit at the comments lol, 
   we would be better off if we joined austria again . 
  they could surely govern this awful country better than our current representatives . 
  1867-1918 best time in hungary 's life, 
  why so relatively high in finland ?

  if this actually goes through , the hungarian government will alienate at least half of its own following ( the half not made of pensioners ) .

  my goodness , if you take the word `` illuminati '' and take out the `` m '' and subsitute `` d '' for it , then take out the first `` i '' and everything after it , then add `` france , '' the word actually turns into `` france '' !,

  [ secret speech made by socialist pm ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferenc_gyurcs%c3%a1ny%27s_speech_in_balaton%c5%91sz%c3%b6d_in_may_2006#obscene_and_offensive_excerpts ) had a few people up in arms about it, 
   yes , it 's a small difference , but it will grow bigger in time , as slovakia will be getting closer to austria and hungary will fall . 
  lol [ slovakia gdp growth by year ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/slovakia/gdp-growth ) [ hungary gdp growth by year ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/hungary/gdp-growth ) four four years , hungary 's gdp expanded at a higher rate than slovakia 's so stop pretending like your state is wealthier . 
  gdp per capita is one indicator and if that 's what we go by , then the opposite of what you say will actually happen , since the hungarian gdp in growing faster . 
  your government seems to be borrowing a lot of money . 
  [ in just four years ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/slovakia/government-debt-to-gdp ) , slovakia 's debt-to-gdp doubled . 
  [ whereas in the same time frame , ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/hungary/government-debt-to-gdp ) hungary 's stayed largely the same . 
  and we started out in 1990 with one of the worst government debt rates in the whole eastern bloc . 
  sorry to break it to you , but your gdp growth is based on government borrowing ( as reflected by the drastic change in debt-to-gdp ) whereas ours is n't ( since the debt stayed the same ) . 
  meaning no , you 're not wealthier , and that will show in 5-10 years when your government will accumulate a 100 % dgdp ( if it continues to borrow at that rate ) . 
  where all europoors , slovakia is marginally better off right now due to government borrowing . 
  no amount of orban or jobbik will make that different . 
  edit : link, 
  hungary is 7th most seeked , and fifth-highest approval rate ? 
  i thought we were still a transit state . 
  take orban out and what then ? 
  jobbik is thr second most popular party now . 
  nobody thinks about that .
