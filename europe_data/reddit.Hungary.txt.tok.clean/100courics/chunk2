  hungarians have clearly shown that they want no more of the left-wing parties ( with the exception of lmp ) so who are the western allies gon na place their bets on ? 
  sure get rid of orban , then what ? 
  ponta 's administration next door is riddled with corruption , yet [ he was in the us just last month ] ( http://mpnewyork.mae.ro/en/local-news/1585 ) . 
  let 's face it : orban administration is directly opposite ideologically to obama 's which is why the clinton group has a massive hard-on for anything concerning hungarian affairs . 
  as comparison , look at gyurcsany 's cabinet . 
  no less riddled with corruption than orban , yet the relation between the two countries was fine . 
   now , most americans will agree with you on that what is being said is wrong , but will staunchly fight for the right to speak freely . 
  maybe until the late 90s that was true , but not since bush/obama . 
  as the nsa scandal showed in your country , most people just do n't give a crap anymore because their lives are too comfortable so they wo n't go out and force their congress to impeach the president once the nsa scandal burst . 
  i respect the american notion of defending freedom of speech til death , but i think the people 's will to protect it is fading . 
  and your politicians know that which is why they keep encroaching upon it . 
  in the future\u0375 should there be : - more eu - same amount of eu - less eu in terms of state-brussels power sharing ? 
  people in this country should learn how to czech . 
  euroskepticism is too vocal , and the government needs to shut the fuck up about displacement of sovereignty . 
  hungary is one of the largest beneficiaries of the eu budget , but the constant nagging is starting to piss off the brits and germans who provide most of the funds . 
  many czechs are also euroskeptics but they are much smarter about it . 
  for the mpst part , they dont say much , just smile , accept the massivr funds and piss off . 
  thats what we need to master : take the money , smile and totally not give a shit about european matters so long as the funds keep coming . 
  we can remaib euroskeptics inside , just not voice it and get the money . 
  this way , everyone gets what they want . 
  could n't [ not post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/hungary/comments/2iyna7/romania_1_1_hungary_we_got_the_goal_weve_been/ ) about it in [ r/hungary ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/hungary/ ) immediately after it ended . 
  fun fact : the word `` shakhter '' sounds a bit like the hungarian word * szatyor * which means `` bag '' . 
  you can imagine how boringly-funny that seemed to hungarians when a hungarian team drew them for cl qualification a few years back . 
  why does n't russell brand give away 99 % of his paycheck to public works programs ? 
  easy to talk to the rest of the world from up there . 
  finns , calling out the real issues, 
  for anyone looking at the weird pattern on hungary and croatia , it 's because of the countries ' constitutions . 
  hungary recently ( 2012 ) explicitly put it in the constitutions that marriage is between a man and woman , but the state allows civil unions for gays . 
  croatia followed by adopting a similar law last year ( i think ) . 
  ps : as someone put it earlier on a thread , very good , little croatia . 
  now gib reunion and access to adria pls, 
  ahh yes , good ol' times when the kid who was baptized was n't allowed to attend university 18 years later . 
  umm , interesting ... i 've never heard of anyone in hungary - local or foreigner/tourist getting sick from hungarian tap water . 
  we have a bunch of springs where the water is diverted from . 
  we have an olof palme boarwalk in budapest . 
  most people , including myself , have no idea who this person was and what he/she did that 's relevant to our history :d, 
  that fan looks like he has atoned for his mistreatment of the player , and is certainly ready to change his ways in the future, 
  we have to lead europe in something . 
  we do n't need economic prosperity or capable military . 
  we have most linguistically-homogenous and stubborn country , so ha !, 
   the world congress of families ( wcf ) , a us-based evangelist group that has already done so much to ruin uganda , has teamed up with the kremlin to parachute into estonia huge quantities of money with which to browbeat , bully and blackmail parliamentarians , with which to spew out tens of thousands of automated provocative hate-speech emails , nothing like some good ol' fashioned `` i 'm tolerant with everyone who supports my view '' - type blog entry to start the day, 
  handball and water polo are the most popular sports here after football . 
  [ this would be interesting though ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/goose_pulling ) . 
  courtesy of the inventive medieval dutch, 
  there 's a szekely ? 
  show yourself !, 
  yup, 
  even our pm did n't ask the crimeans or anyone to accept the russian annexation, 
  do n't know how the author managed to miss this bombshell and talk about the menial budapest/bucharest issue instead . 
  [ this is the only up-to-date photo i could find of our military in action ] ( http://gb.fotolibra.com/images/previews/593533-old-kazakh-soldier-street-musician.jpeg ) . 
  brace yourself , hungary 's enemies !, 
  poor lithuania the only country to not make massive gains in the region . 
  haha would n't be a r/europe conversation without such a post, 
  waiting for `` suck it sweden '' posts from danes, 
  107 % of voters in a certain district agree with # 3, 
  crossing the mid-atlantic ridge is going to be a bitch for them, 
   the worst part though , is that real madrid and barcelona wo n't play in the same league . 
  i do n't think barcelona would leave the primera . 
  it would kind of be an as monaco in the ligue 1-type situation . 
  9/10 lada 's will survive the war . 
  should use them instead of t-72s, 
  have n't heard that joke more than 5 million times, 
  hey austria , share some of that solar power with the brothas, 
  a busy day for eastern europe, 
  i 'm all for a law like this , but how is it implemented ? 
  like how could you enforce it ? 
   you should be worried about jobbik , not random rednecks in the rural south yeah , coming from a swede whose country just voted in a far-right party that 's just as bad as jobbik . 
  yeah you guys definitely have the right to talk . 
  how many deaths has jobbik been responsible for over the eight years it has been around ? 
  wow , my goodness !, 
  let 's see if your jobbik can hold out for eight years without causing death ... edit : also , i just found [ this neat article ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20140923/loophole-lets-neo-nazis-onto-swedish-councils ) on r/europe posted not long ago . 
  yeah no you guys are definitely in the position to criticize jobbik . 
   have you even been to the us ? 
  yes , yes i have . 
  i lived there for a year , and it was enough to see what happens in most states south/southwest of washington dc . 
  i 'm not saying the us is any more racist than the average euro country , but 4 % is pure bs . 
   maybe look at your own country a bit instead of hating on the us what , is that supposed to be some kind of insult at hungarian racism ? 
  hey man , nobody died in hungary due to racism / `` social equality '' recently . 
  i also ca n't think of any sharia police units being formed here . 
  i also ca n't see muslim-nonmuslim clashes here . 
  how about in malmo ? 
  i heard life is very interesting over there this time of the year ... 
  that 's only if orban drops out . 
  it 's not impossible , seeing as what happened after the earlier 2008-09 orban sex scandal . 
  we now know that americans live in a serious case of denial or mastered the art of lying . 
  i think orban has the best chance . 
  but , on the other hand , orban has also been gaining popularity . 
  and of course we can not forget that orban too is in the race . 
  so , in overall , my prediction for chances of winning are 65 % / 25 % / 10 % for orban/orban/orban . 
  should be an exciting one in 2018 . 
  surprise irish reunification !, 
  or surprise anschluss of ireland by the uk !, 
  either way , someone 's bound to have a shitty day . 
  yay !, 
  it 's a family reunion !, 
  noe just make sure nobody tells serbia . 
  hey , you guys had your phase with heider , now let us ride this one out . 
  why do n't we just reunite ? 
  problem solved, 
   european norms seeing as scotland was just allowed a referendum on not only autonomy but independence , it seems that a referendum on autonomy would seem compatible with `` european norms '' .
