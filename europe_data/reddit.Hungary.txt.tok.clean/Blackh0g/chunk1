/ r/europe is just polandrectangle really, 
  was n't that about armenians ? 
  this is kinda like a reverse genocide . 
  a fuckocide if you will . 
  it was just a reasonable thing to assume that you are english given the context i think . 
  probably . 
  post was deleted , so i do n't really remember that well . 
   it 's nice that you assume i 'm english as well . 
  you have a uk flair, 
  rising sea levels will also make their country harder to keep afloat . 
  that 's what she said . 
  horse slavs  vampire slavs ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  i believe quality of life also has a large share in it, 
  it would take a really long time to bring nk 's economy up to sk 's level as well . 
  i kinda find it funny how the entire continent is nearly one giant german flag . 
  to be honest a war against russia would end up in a big chunk of roughly europe looking landmass covered in 10 meter thick glass, 
  uh , i 'd rather not get beaten up . 
  ooh , so that 's what we are gon na do today ? 
  we are gon na fight ? 
  afaik inbreeding only comes in when you are marrying very close relatives , sisters , brothers and parents . 
  so if i were to dress up as a giant deodorant and rob a bank , no one would believe it happened ? ^ ^ / s, 
  snap , turkey is one big motherfucker, 
  [ sorry , i had to . 
  i just had to . 
  god damn it i 'm a man jim not a doctor ] ( https://youtu.be/qd5mqjvhw9c?t=27s ), 
  you are a lovable kind of moron thank you, 
  i do n't think the eu could do that . 
  only the usa has enough power projection in the world to stabilise that region . 
  maybe russia . 
  but then , russia . 
  why not ? 
  now , i do n't wan na appear weird or anything , but suddenly some bdsm polandball images popped into my head reading that last sentence . 
  ~ ~ when meeting with world leaders , ~ ~ trump ~ ~ always looks like he has ~ ~ no ~ ~ idea what he 's doing there . ~ ~, 
  you know , that woman who murdered girls and bathed in their blood . 
  and skulls . 
  do n't forget the skulls . 
  rename capital to holy terra . 
  adopt high gothic as the official language . 
  begin unifying the techno barbarians . 
  proclaim the god emperor the eternal ruler of mankind . 
  i was making a joke about how trump tries ruin the usa 's healthcare system so the rich can get a tax cut . 
  being overly nationalistic leads to pretty god damn horrific things , and i get that . 
  i dislike nationalism pretty god damn heavily myself , but abolishing national holidays , because they instill some patriotism and nationalism is like banning alcohol consumption . 
  not a good idea . 
  it will achieve the polar opposite . 
  instead he will take your healthcare away / s, 
  it is celebrated because it was a defining moment of hungary . 
  it paved the way to the dualism and somewhat of a cultural golden age of the country . 
  the gripen has very good bucks per flying hour compared to other jets . 
  last i heard they plan to start doing this in the late 2020s, 
  inflatable habitation modules . 
  there are also some ways to create something like cement from the regolith on the moon . 
  would n't a combined eu army cut down on r&d costs a lot ? 
  for example you would n't have to develop and upgrade a bunch of different mbts , afvs , ships , etc. 
  the amount of time i spend trying to decide whether i see an italian flag or a hungarian flag hoisted the wrong way is somewhat embarrassing . 
  you guys know how to pork good . 
  all clay belongs to us, 
  in what way are they are worse ? 
  i know that they have n't had as much practice as the us military , but i have n't heard any major screw ups from them lately . 
  not trying to sound like a german fanboy or anything , i 'm just curious . 
  was n't there some talk lately that if germany reaches that 2 % gdp military spending nato obligation thing they will have the biggest military in the eu ? 
  oh boy , i hope this ai n't gon na be another sad moment for our continental love fest . 
  sadly we do not have fancy brazilian characters here at orbanistan , all the euromonies for it got stolen :( ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  sorry , i meant no offense . 
  i would say sorry in your language , but i do not know any brazilian ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  honestly at this point there should be at least one billionaire playboy ( * squints at elon * ) who dresses up as a flying mammal and slap these people . 
  like seriously . 
  ya poor , poor spanish slavs ^ ^ / s, 
  and family means no one gets left behind, 
  i feel like we are living in a game of vic 2 and someone just made liquor unprofitable . 
  it could , it would be just harder for demagogues to turn a democracy into a dictatorship, 
  i 've heard that people who stay active longer , kinda `` delay '' getting old . 
  essentially when you stop working or doing things you enjoy the aging gets much faster . 
  i completely believe that to be honest , i have relatives at both end of the story and the one who is active is way more happier and younger looking despite them being nearly the same age . 
  yeah , the slowly reverting back into toddler-level part is the scary one . 
  reading about these really old people , i always think about how utterly terrifying it is to grow old . 
  * to grow so old . 
  yeah , k\u00e1d\u00e1r was mostly sane and not hellbent on making everyone 's life a living nightmare . 
  funny thing though , i remembered a story about a hungarian spy who `` prevented '' wwiii by notifying the cia that the hungarian intelligence acquired information regarding nato forces and had the codes to defuse the nuclear mines placed along the west german border .

  iirc the hungarians could only use them in a case of nuclear war basically . 
  [ they were removed in the late 80s . 
  ] ( http://articles.latimes.com/1991-04-23/news/mn-494_1_nuclear-weapons ), 
  we have nuclear reactors since the '70s . 
  funny thing , hungary was once a `` nuclear power '' . 
  we had some soviet nukes stored here and the hungarian army * could * use them in a `` ohshiettheworldisending '' scenario . 
  i mean , what 's fishy about this ? 
  hungary wanted to buy a small nuclear reactor , iran was the lowest bidder . 
  end of story . 
  it 's probably for a university and the reason the government goes with iran is because they are the cheapest option . 
  it 's probably for scientific purposes , i 'd guess . 
  imperator invicta, 
  there 's a shooter called warhammer 40k space marine , that was pretty okay . 
  there 's also a warhammer total war game , they are currently developing the second one . 
  some of them have at least nice [ cinematics ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3w3xehpsis ), 
  mutti invicta, 
  does alaska have unpronounceable places that damages your environment then ? 
  i thought our alaska was finland or norway, 
  i thought the uk was the texas of europe, 
  look , you can find certain slates that have such a low porosity and permeability that it takes hundreds of thousands of years for a drop of water to move meters in the stone .
