you cant do it . 
  they dont use the official border crossings . 
  they just travel to the border then walk through at a field . 
  the army cant do shit since they are not allowed to shoot . 
  fascist ? 
  fidesz was always a centre , centre-right party at max . 
  having common sense makes him fascist in your eyes . . its just shows how much you have no idea about him . 
  call him egoist or something atleast that would be somewhat right . 
  the serbs were busing them to us for months and while we did n't like it we still tried to enforce the laws and we registered good percentage of them . 
  croatia just mass dumps everyone to the hungary border without registering so it 's not like they have to care for them for a while . 
  i try to understand the views of leaders like the austrian chancellor but i just ca n't . 
  5000-10000 are coming daily . 
  a month ago it was 2000-3000 . 
  it 's clear that the numbers are increasing every day . 
  `` let all of them pass '' . 
  what are they going to do when 20000 will come every day ? 
  it 's almost like they want to flood europe with migrants with the sole purpose of changing europe 's ethnicity . 
   hopefully now that we are over the quota talks are we ? 
  they agreed to distribute 160k . 
  what happens to the rest ? 
  6000 are coming daily . 
  will they meet every month and agree on expanding the quota every time ? 
  i just do n't see the point of this whole decision . 
  i do n't think the countries that voted no against the mandatory quotas are turning their back to italy or greece . 
  hungary wants to organise an eu army to help defend greek borders . 
  we are willing to help with funds and also with manpower . 
  but the eu is not a federal state and they shouldnt have accepted the mandatory quotas without unanimous vote . 
  every sovereign country should have the right to decide if they want migrants or not . 
  v4 countries have hundreds of years of history together . 
  for example [ louis i of hungary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/louis_i_of_hungary ) was a hungarian , polish and also croatian king . 
  lot of hungarians consider poles as brothers . 
  [ no ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ly3k0/disputed_eu_migrant_plan_voted_in_eu_ministers/cvah0tn ), 
  atleast the eu [ managed ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ut85vrg.jpg ) to make the hungarian-slovak relations better . 
  because we would be a front country then with huge capacity of camps ( 50k + ) where we should register and then distribute them . 
  we are n't the first eu country they enter so these camps should n't be in hungary . 
  in my opinion eu should build these camps outside of eu . 
  if he keeps his word then there is nothing wrong with representing the majority of the people . 
  that is exactly what a politician should do . 
   without the eu you 'd be dealing with this crisis by yourself . 
  noone wants to stay in hungary . 
  these economic migrants only want to stay in rich countries , like germany , sweden etc. 
  this why the eu wants mandatory quotas . 
  about the big eu help , we got like 10 million euros from the eu but we spent like 200m on the migration crisis . 
  why it is so hard to understand that we do not want illegal immigrants ? 
  they are not refugees , they travelled through turkey , greece , macedonia , serbia . 
  all of these countries are safe . 
  after they leave the first safe country which is turkey , they are illegal migrants . 
  however if other eu countries want them then take them but dont fucking force us to take them as well . 
  god bless the slovaks and this man . 
  yeah they did publish the results . 
  more than 1 million people filled out the survey . 
  90 % of them thinks that eu 's migration policy have failed and that we need stricter regulations and we need to send back everyone who entered hungary and the eu illegally . 
  few more decisions like this and majority of hungarians would n't mind leaving it either . 
  stop implying that the rich western countries are not getting anything from the eastern countries . 
  what about the hundreds of thousands of workers that are working and paying taxes and boosting the western countries economy ? 
  what about the huge marketplace the western companies are getting without having to pay duty ? 
  you did n't answer my question at all . 
  whats the fucking point of relocating 160k migrants when 6000 are coming daily ? 
  they relocate 160k then what happens to the 180k coming next month and so on ? 
  are they are allowed just to go anywhere they want to ? 
  because on this issue only one view is reasonable . 
  whats the fucking point of relocating 160k migrants when 6000 coming daily ? 
  theres no sense in that . 
  even the migrants will not accept that . 
  like how they gon na accept it that some of them have to stay in hungary , romania while others can be in germany , france , etc. 
  6000 coming a day and they forced countries to relocate 160k . 
  what a genius plan lol . 
  i guess they will have to meet again a month later to agree on 320k ... 
  the eu can fuck off . 
  we will hold a referendum about this 100 % . 
  orb\u00e1n and fidesz is democratically elected and out of 25 years they had in the national assembly they have been in the opposition for 16 years yet the far liberals label them as an authorian party . 
  they are not any less democratic than our previous government . 
  the fuck is wrong with the western left parties ? 
  slovakia has a centre-left government yet they have been pretty reasonable the whole time about the migration issue . 
  protecting your people and country from illegal migrants is considered a racist , far-right thing to do ? 
  if they label fidesz as that how the hell are they gon na call jobbik ? 
  if you do n't know shit what im talking about then why are you even replying to me ? 
  yeah wanting to preserve and defend our country and nation is a far-right thing to do in your sensitive little liberal heart . . 
  well gyurcsany is a well known traitor and anti-hungarian and you sound like one too . 
  i do n't have anything to debate with you , as i already said you are not any better than the hungarians who are living abroad therefore they deserve the citizenship just as much as you . 
  does n't mean jackshit if they are not living in hungary , they are hungarians so they should have the right to hold the citizenship if they want to . 
  citizenship does n't mean that they also have to have a right to vote . 
  it 's like listening to gyurcsany . . 
   they are just as hungarians as the ones who live in post-trianon hungary . 
  you are a disgrace if you do n't think this way . 
  lol like 20k out of the 30k are only like office workers or they are doing something that has nothing to do with actual soldier tasks . 
  and they dump them to germany . 
  everyone should be happy . 
  the migrants get to where they want to , serbia , hungary , croatia and austria does n't have to deal with them for a long time and germany can welcome them as mamma merkel is waiting them . 
   see above . 
  southern slovakia still has hungarian [ majority ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/slovakia_2011_ethnic.png ) i 'm not kidding . 
  compare [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/ethnographic_map_of_hungary_1910_by_teleki_carte_rouge.jpg ) with the map i linked . 
  would have been the fairest borders . 
  i agree but it 's a dead agreement nowadays , noone really cares about it anymore . 
  almost every country used forced assimilation . 
  just like how there was [ slovakization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slovakization ) and [ romanianization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanianization ) too . 
  in 1910 30.2 % of the population of slovakia was hungarian . 
  in 2001 it was 9.7 % so i guess they did their job too . . 
  it just was n't fair . 
  southern part of slovakia was 80-90 percent hungarian at the time of trianon .
