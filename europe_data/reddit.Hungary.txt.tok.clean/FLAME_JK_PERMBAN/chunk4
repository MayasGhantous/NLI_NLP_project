   a syrian claiming asylum in finland would not be decline either . 
  that 's not true at all . 
  in hungary 133 585 applied for asylum until 25st of august . 
  39 % of them were syrians , total of 39 981 . 
  since ** all ** of them had to travel through ** safe ** countries , like serbia , macedonia , greece , turkey , only less than 300 of them got granted some sort of refugee status . 
  this is unmanageable . 
  merkel 's statement that every syrian will be granted refugee status is a suicide to europe . 
  even if they grant them it , they should n't have said it publicly . 
  every illegal migrant just sees it now that they have a chance . 
  they know the eu asylum system is collapsing and more and more will come just to abuse it to get into europe . 
  a fresh [ picture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wendw2q.jpg?1 ) from the hungarian border . 
  they just arrived to abuse the system too . 
  ok i checked it , it 's 86 % . 
  still huge as fuck . 
  between 1st of january and 25th of august 157 000 illegal migrants entered hungary , 133 585 of them applied for asylum . 
  also heres a list of migrants sorted by their nationality : * 33 % syrian * 27 % afghan * 18 % kosovian * 9 % pakistanis * 4 % iraqian * 2 % bangladeshi * 1 % iranian * 1 % congolese * 1 % palestinian * 1 % nigerian * 3 % other [ source ] ( http://alfahir.hu/megtudtuk_innen_jonnek_a_bevandorlok ), 
  very true . 
  we only inherited the land temporary , to develop it and maintain our culture , heritage and then to pass it to our descendants . 
  by taking huge amount of people with different culture and language we are risking all of these things . 
  95 % of the illegal migrants who entered hungary already applied for asylum . 
  but they do n't want a refugee status here , as they want more money , free housing etc. 
  they only apply for asylum because if they tell the police that they are refugees , police ca n't arrest them for illegal border crossing . 
  they only abuse the european asylum system to get into eu . 
  we are not handling them awful . 
  we do n't want them . 
  they are n't coming because of safety reasons , they were safe in turkey , greece , macedonia , serbia . 
  they just want more money and welfare . 
  they crossed all of these countries illegally , they broke laws , and then they want free housing , food and money ? 
  i have to work for all these things why should we give them these from my tax money ? 
  that 's totally unfair . 
  we are sheeps because we are against them ? 
  i would call the people helping them sheeps . 
  they rather help illegal migrants from all over the world than helping hungarians . 
  what a shame . 
  by taking large amount of people with different culture and language you are risking your culture and nation in a long run as majority of them are not going to integrate . 
  just look at big european cities where there are muslim/migrant districts only and even police are afraid to go there . 
  you want that in hungary too ? 
  are you sure ? 
  because trains are going from nyugati to debrecen . 
  we will take the austrians then when they will have to flee from their home country because of migrants . 
  why are you comparing people who wants to deport them with ss ? 
  israel is doing it right now , why dont you compare them to israel ? 
  israel told migrants to go back to their countries or they will be put in a prison in a desert . 
  where is the outrage ? 
  one of our biggest tragedies . 
  we have n't been independ since then . 
  worse thing is we could have won it as we had the military power to stop them . 
  the main army led by the king himself did n't wait for the transylvanian and for the croatian army and this lead to ottomans almost numbering twice as many as hungarians . 
  we had our good share of success too even though things are n't the best now , but we are still here and this is what matters the most . 
  so your point is everyone who lives in romania are romanian ? 
  do you think the ones who fled knew what will be the end of the revolution ? 
  unless they had superpowers they didnt know how long will the revolution last . 
  at the time when they fled basically a war broke out with soviet tanks and army moving towards budapest . 
  also you seem to do n't know shit about r\u00e1kosi 's reign . 
   approximately 350,000 officials and intellectuals were purged under his rule , from 1948 to 1956 . 
  r\u00e1kosi imposed totalitarian rule on hungary -- arresting , jailing and killing both real and imagined foes in various waves of stalin-inspired political purges . 
  it 's ridiculous to think that they only emigrated because of the economic conditions . 
  i hope you are not serious . 
  you should be proud to be a hungarian . 
  sz\u00e9kelys are hungarians . . 
  yeah we will never accept the quota system especially when were are under heavy pressure . 
  just yesterday more than 3200 illegal migrants entered the country . 
  do n't be a victim of the leftish media . 
  they do n't report these kind of things so you have to get your own sources . 
  you ca n't define it that easily . 
  and it was n't something you can invent . 
  actually there are more than one theories of nationalism origin . 
  for example :  from a political or sociological perspective , there are two main perspectives on the origins and basis of nationalism . 
  one is the primordialist perspective that describes nationalism as a reflection of the ancient and perceived evolutionary tendency of humans to organize into distinct groupings based on an affinity of birth . 
  the other is the modernist perspective that describes nationalism as a recent phenomenon that requires the structural conditions of modern society in order to exist . 
  also even laws were made in middle ages that revolved around nationalism . 
  for example the main pillars of the hungarian golden bull of 1222 are : * hungarian properties can not be given to foreigners . 
  * no jew or ismaelite can hold a public position ( job ) . 
  the nobles of the chamber , those working with monies , tax collectors and toll-keepers may only be hungarian noblemen . 
  * if foreigners arrive in the kingdom , they must not receive honors and public positions without the royal council 's approval . 
  in the 16th and 17th century when the middle part of hungary was under ottoman rule the hungarians refused to have children with non hungarians . 
  big hungarian cities even discriminated the ones who did not keep themselves to that . 
  we are saying the same . 
   would be like today syrians moving from isis occupied territories to safe western areas in the country i mean it would be like syrians from east syria moving to west syria . 
  for what else they want to go to west ? 
  for safety ? 
  they were safe in turkey , greece , etc. . 
  nationalism is the only way to preserve our history , values and culture . 
  without it and with uncontrolled immigration no country and nation has a future as over time you become a minority in your own country . 
  just look at kosovo , that land is an ancient serb land . 
  ottoman rule , then shitloads of albans went there and now serbians are minority . 
  east germans fleeing to west germany would be like today syrians moving from isis occupied territories to safe western areas in syria . 
  but they travel through several safe countries just to get better welfare . 
  are you guys for real ? 
  comparing east german refugees to syrian ones ? 
  they were occupied by soviets . 
  they didnt cross over 5 + countries illegaly ( while being safe ) like the syrians . 
  they just moved in their own country . 
  a german had every right to live in germany , being it west or east . 
  theres a reason its called germany . 
  i do n't know where are you from but if i would have to choose between a syrian or eritrean or a hungarian i would choose the latter 10 out of 10 . 
  i do n't have anything common with a syrian but i share almost everything with a hungarian . 
  it 's not superiority i just love my country and nation more . 
  are you implying being nationalist is bad ? 
  nationalism is what made countries survive for centuries .
