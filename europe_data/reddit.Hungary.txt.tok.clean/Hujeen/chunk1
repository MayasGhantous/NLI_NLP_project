we take the anti-islam party they could counterbalance our anti-jewish party, 
  i think he meant us , hungarians . 
  true most of us did n't react to anything . 
  well wealthy people probably have their own cars and find it easier to pay for gas . 
  i think if this law make rich boys get on trains , then it 's a benefit for the enviroment , and in the long run , everyone !, 
  the goverment came up with the idea of [ taxing the internet ] ( http://www.portfolio.hu/en/economy/hungary_to_impose_internet_levy_in_2015_tax_plans_show.28561.html ) . 
  there will be a demonstration later today . 
  last week it came to light that the usa have banned six individuals from visiting her soil . 
  there was an article about this in a pro-fidesz newspaper which tried to twist the story . 
  it backfired however , because before that nobody knew about the bannings . 
  now there is a [ huge scandal ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2014/10/22/hungary-confronts-obama-administration-over-travel-bans/ ) , because the six individuals are suspected to be goverment officals , one being the head of the tax office . 
  what is even more disturbing for us that the usa claims that they are corrupt . 
  which very well may be true as last year there was a [ whistleblower ] ( http://atlatszo.hu/2013/11/08/whistleblower-claims-corruption-in-government-enables-large-scale-vat-fraud-in-hungary/ ) who claimed that the tax office intentionally turns a blind eye to vat fraud . 
  also this week we commemorated the heroes of the 1956 revolution against the soviet union . 
  meanwhile there was a [ law proposed ] ( http://budapestbeacon.com/economics/hungary-clears-way-for-southern-stream-gas-pipeline/ ) which would allow the goverment to build the southern stream even if the eu forbids it . 
  so all in all just another week in orb\u00e1nland . 
  it was well know by the government that \u00d6kot\u00e1rs helps other ngos financially , without charging interests which is technically not financial activity . 
  besides the government first targeted for unauthorized party funding , then embezzlement then now for handing out money . 
  kehi ( the audit office ) is grasping at straws to find something that they can pin on \u00d6kot\u00e1rs . 
  besides the documents they seized are not related to their alleged illegal financial activity rather they are all related to the 13 ngos the ** government listed ** as left-wing sympathisers . 
  the list contains watchdog and monitoring organisations who revealed embarrassing corruption cases for basically all parties , feminist and lgbt-organisations and organisations who work for democratic rights ... 
  we keep in mind  but unfortunately everybody is in the state of indifference right now, 
  new article : http://www.liberties.eu/en/news/putinization-hungary, 
  autonomy okay , honestly i do n't really care about politics , just do n't have stupid or corrupt ones , or at least not as stupid and corrupt as ours . 
   i 'm a little nervous about orban wanting to `` liberate '' you with tanks in the future . 
  :p do n't worry hungarian army is ill-fitted , we spend less and less on military each year ( which i think is not a problem ), 
  good to know  i hear that you have great internet speeds , cheap liquor and food , and beautiful landscape . 
  what else ? 
  that 's not true . 
  for example our government made a tax which targeted the largest non-partisan tv channel . 
  that 's a harsh thing to say about a country . 
  but once you pass the criteria you can basically roll back into an autocracy, 
  the spanish foreign minister said that they `` would consider it '' , they do n't rule it outright , but when it comes to the decision they probably at least obstruct it if not veto it . 
  neigh , rules are rules , especially if we talk about such a burocratic organisation as the eu, 
  i think yes . 
  nope , because spain would veto it, 
  they wouldnae be part of the eu !, 
  they would n't be part of the eu, 
  lol turkey never join the eu, 
  thanks i did n't know , 
  of course we have , but law hardly matters , because the current government has unlimited power to impose its own ideology . 
  okay then fidesz is clearly a liberal party because it was the youth party for szdsz  we do have a coalition government : fidesz-kdnp . 
  for all intends and purposes it 's one party . 
  can you name one policy which is different between the two ? 
   the socialists/communists every well-written critique from right against the socialist was about how neo-liberal were . 
  calling the communist is like calling orb\u00e1n fascist - stupid . 
   so , i 'll ask again , who would do a better job of the candidates offered ? 
  what 's your problem with lmp ? 
  you only mentioned their unpopularity -  so ? 
  to be honest i would want a coalition government , or fidesz to self destruct and be replaced by a reasonable right-wing party . 
  i hope everything is understandable from my translation , but if you know hungarian feel free to come up with your own !, 
  in my personal opinion it 's really scary stuff that they retroactively change documents just to appease the prime minister . 
  i find the line `` it 's a communist thing to say that the stadium of felcs\u00fat was built from public funds '' very funny and sad at the same time . 
  i thought that this would be interesting for / r/europe as a ` slice of life ' kind of news from hungary , and if the subreddit is interested i 'm willing to sometimes translate interesting articles . 
  we have a shitty government . 
  i know it 's up to us to do something about it , and hopefully we will , but up until then i ask for your opinions , encouragement and/or sympathies . 
  yeah i agree , it 's basically goes like this : build a school for romanian students - you did good for the 88.9 % of the population build a school for hungarian students - you did good for the 6.5 % of the population if you want to be popular you always target largest demographic groups first . 
  gladly ... if i can be your prime minister !, 
  the west is declining , do n't forget !, 
  territories where ethnic minorities are in a majority are usually the last priority when it comes to governmental spending . 
  sad but true . 
  well this is [ not the first time ] ( http://atlatszooktatas.cink.hu/keleti-nyitas-a-foldrajzversenyen-es-meg-hogyan-1567912612 ) this happens . 
  what is interesting and scary though that probably there is no direct governmental orders or pressure behind this , just simply servilism to the ruling ideology . 
  some people just like to parrot ( what they think is ) the leading politicians ' view . 
  this is what leads to cases like this . 
  of course it certainly has a lot of do with the ruling party ( fidesz ) . 
  they try to build a ideological/cultural monopoly with governmental funds . 
  that 's why they do n't like the norwegian funds , because it clashes with the nationalistic , and so-called christian hegemony of theirs . 
  if you want to teach democracy come to us , lots of us like nordic guys , 
  what do you mean active relationship ? 
  besides none of the ngos - of which the goverment offically listed as `` problematic '' - are related to lmp , they are mostly pro-transparency , pro-democratic , anti-corruption , lgbt and pro-women 's right agencies . 
  only one of them is actively opposing the goverment ( kr\u00e9tak\u00f6r - an art workshop ) , but they do it on certain cases , for example when ngos are threatened . 
  nope nope nope !, 
  they did n't give out the money to lmp . 
  they did give out a lot of ngos that have similar values but none of the money ended up in lmp . 
  what are those values ? 
  liberalism , environmentalism , equal rights . 
  i do n't see a problem with supporting any of these . 
  it makes sense in the [ context ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/02/us-hungary-norway-funding-ngo-iduskbn0ed1qw20140602 ), 
  more like having a new foreign factories ( audi and mercedes ) works, 
  which ones ? 
  because stadium sure as hell wo n't sustain themselves, 
  because if you can be fired for writing or publishing an article then you do n't have freedom . 
  do n't you understand ? 
  if you they can pressure you into not writing articles then it 's obviously violated . 
  well he is not being politically incorrect , he is being stupid . 
  just imagine if obama would shut down the times because it reported on the nsa story . 
   obviously the voters . 
  first time 52 % , then second time 47 % with gerrymandering ... so they do n't have the backing of around half of the country who voted . 
  obviously this , by your definition , would suggest that today 53 % of the hungarian population is unpatriotic and should have no power whatsoever . 
   supermajority twice is no dictatorship . 
  it 's not , however the kind of power centralisation they 've been doing will lead them there . 
   fidesz does everything wrong , but if they just get one thing right and that is stripping the old elites of influence that is great . 
  then we strip them of influence as well if they get too bad . 
  yeah because if they have all the power , surely we can strip them from it . 
  basically you think the problem is that there is a mafia and you would replace them with a stronger one who are in control with the whole coutry . 
  great solution , good job . 
  well you just said it 's justified using the same reasons that any dictatorship would use . 
  who decides who the ` normal patriots ' are ? 
  wow , just wow .
