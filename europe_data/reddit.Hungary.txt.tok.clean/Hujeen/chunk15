  do n't you have like a flemish nationalist party ? 
  are n't they at least energic ? 
  no , but somehow you still got in . 
  show us !, 
  i am not sure i follow . 
  you are degrading people who protest , while adding nothing to the discussion . 
  yeah , sorry our government is a bit of a dick . 
  to be fair in iraq the government and the sunni militias are on the same side ( for now ) . 
   however , let 's not forget this is very complex subject and when one country tell other countries how to behive regarding they migration politics ( actually , all politics ) that 's worrying and i tell you why - because it clearly shows that eu is not a union , it 's trying to be dictatorship and the dictators here are the the biggest countries ( economicaly speaking ) . 
  say if 21 are for and 5 are against is it a dictatorship ? 
  we disagree . 
  jobbik is at worst like ukip , fidesz is going bnp . 
  there was a case recently when somebody peacefully protested and he was followed by authorities until his home and was asked for his id . 
  also there was an autocrash involving the head of the pm 's office , where a woman died . 
  a person commented on an article saying that he wished the politician died instead . 
  authorities tried to find he , but could n't . 
  there are a lot of similar cases , but these two are the most resembling your story . 
  also you ca n't deny the holocaust and the crimes by the soviet regime in hungary . 
  i afraid it 's not uniquely british ... just this is where it finally pops out . 
  breitbart - 10 % percent of the time it 's right all the time . 
  why ? 
  it 's not the same . 
  if they investigate and prosecute it 's fine by me . 
  i got it  but i would have still got it if it was more subtle , 
  is n't there a german equivalent to 5th avenue ? 
  this is a pretty average week in politics in hungary . 
  unfortunately society is so fractured that the government can get away with everything without a dent in their popularity . 
  do you support national sovereignty or only if it 's your nation 's ? 
  ** government funds ` ngo ' that always supports the government 's position ** * turns out that the government via the state-owned utility company give half a billion hufs to an ` ngo ' called forum of civic alliance ( c\u00d6f ) . 
  this is n't too surprising because c\u00d6f never disagreed with the government position and organised huge `` peace rallies '' in support of them . 
  but this story shows the hypocrisy of the government who wants to brand ngos which receive foreign contributions , because they claim that those ngos do n't represent the civil society .

  ceu 's hungarian operation was made unlawful by a recently passed law which was fast-tracked through the parliament . 
  government-linked website ( 888 . hu ) did some digging after lov\u00e1sz 's statement and found out that he has american citizenship ( which is not surprising considering he had an academic career in the us ) . 
  they found this information in lov\u00e1sz official english cv and wikipedia page , but in their article they wrote like the mathematician keep this information secret .

  sorry to hear that . 
  does po have inherit problems , though ( corruption , cronyism ) ? 
  there is always a first . 
  it 's not left-wing it 's liberal . 
  that 's america . 
  to be fair , the walls were not built to keep anyone out ... 
  checking passports and processing an asylum request is not the same thing . 
  also your story confuses me . 
  you live with a syrian refugees who had a fake syrian passports ? 
  if it 's common knowledge then the authorities also know this and they have ways to authenticate documents . 
  while i do n't fault you for your skepticism , i do n't see why the authorities would not double-check everything . 
  that 's why they have state of emergency , then ? 
  because they are so safe ? 
  your feelings are not reality . 
  if you have proof contact the authorities . 
  they have more knowledge than you , and believe me they are more than happy to prove someone is not from syria . 
   yes they claimed it . 
  http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/07/kurdish-group-claims-revenge-murder-turkish-police-150722132945249.html i was wrong then . 
   isis is dying hopefully you are right . 
  to the other points : i see no ypg-pkk link , because only as far as i know turkey says there is such a link . 
  for example the us says there is n't . 
  isis was there since 2014 at the turkish-syrian border . 
  did turkey do anything then ? 
  why not ? 
   sure how about do some empathy and critize ypg-pkk too then ? 
  i called them a terrorist organisation . 
  do i need to further criticise them ? 
  do i have to hold turkey to the same standard as a terrorist organisation ? 
   what happened was turkey refused to aid kobane 's defense and isis blew up bunch of pro-pkk kurds in suruc which pkk blamed it was orchestrated by turkey to with no evidence and literally murdered police officers in their sleep . 
  do you have any evidence that the pkk leadership ordered those attacks ? 
   your entire argument rests on `` but they fight isis my live is more important than yours so leave them alone '' . 
  nope . 
  isis kills more turks than europeans last i checked . 
  i believe eu ( which is founded in 1992 with the maastrict treaty ) is the manifestation of european values . 
  it 's a value the eu is founded upon . 
  okay i bite . 
  first of i think we should agree that kurdish people need rights as a minority both in syria and turkey . 
  secondly i would say that the ypg is really good fighting with isis , so maybe leave them to fight ? 
  regarding pkk it is a separatist terrorist organisation , something the european countries has a lot of experience with ( ira , eta ) . 
  it was also negotiating peace and had a ceasefire with turkey before the military started to bomb kurds in syria . 
  so i think there is no wonder why turkey is criticised over these issues . 
  is the free movement of europeans not a value ? 
  maybe . 
  but . . did you ever hear the tragedy of darth plagueis the wise ?
