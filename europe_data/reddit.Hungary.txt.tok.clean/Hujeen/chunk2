  `` everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression ; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference , and impart information and ideas through any media regardless of frontiers '', 
  idependent from the goverment , so the goverment should n't be able to interfere . 
  sure , sure that makes it right then, 
  state capture, 
  so you are saying it 's better that hungary has to take all of them ? 
  i like you , 
  hungary could take like 5000 in quotas . 
  our goverment wants to take no-one . 
  i want you to prove that there is no invisible pink unicorn . 
  after the hungarian revolution , around 1000 hungarian combantant entered austria , most of them with military gear . 
  they were granted asylum . 
   if you pick up arms and fight a government you are an extremist , does n't matter if you are on the `` right '' side or not . 
  great logic comrade , you are now , the moderator of / r/pyongang !, 
  `` identity of nation '' lol , is it a new white supremacist buzzword ? 
  yeah because if we take 5000 of them , there will be like 10 million of them in two years so they outnumber us !, 
  let us be afraid !, 
  how is turkey ? 
  how is lebanon ? 
  well those who are in lebanon or turkey do n't cross the border . 
  also because you are fucking lucky to live in europe not in some shithole . 
  [ un chief : most reaching europe deserve to seek asylum ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/un-chief-most-reaching-europe-deserve-to-seek-asylum/a-18702400 ) and orb\u00e1n says no to refugee quotas . 
  it 's the mass hysteria induced by the goverment controlled media mostly . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2015/09/07/germany-thinks-its-fucking-great-or-something-hungarian-pm/ ), 
  more people are willing to register in austria than hungary , so yes . 
   but you know how crap our bureaucracy is . 
  i mean , even for hungarians ... 
  but western media does n't say hungary is overwhelmed , they say this is outright malice and deliberate brutality . 
  it would be forgiveable if they at least tried . 
  how many people were in keleti from the goverment ? 
  according to some reports only 2 . 
  anyway the goverment did everything to be as arbitary as possible . 
  * `` you have to go to camps '' * `` okay you can stay at the railway station '' * `` you ca n't ride on trains to w. europe '' * `` okay , maybe you can '' * `` no you ca n't and we wo n't even let you into the railway station '' * `` oh now you can go on the station , but all trains are cancelled . '', 
  * `` that train with the german flag on it ? 
  yeah sure go on it '' * `` now you will be detained in a camp , lol '' * `` you want out ? 
  here are some buses '' * `` sorry no buses for you , but you can take train '' * `` you have to register ''  anyway , yes this is part of the chaos and unpreparedness . 
  but how can you prepare for such a thing in the middle of the city , with people who are determined to stay and wo n't allow being transported to the real refugee camps with real supplies ? 
  who was the cause of the unpreparedness ? 
  the politicans were saying that a great migrant wave is coming , yet they did n't do anything . 
  your point is ? 
  maybe they can ask russia for a war . 
  they seem eager, 
  turkey , serbia , macedonia or greece is not considered safe for asylum countries as per un, 
  is `` crush hate-speech '' not a valid sentiment ? 
   they say there 's no water 30 meters from the water fountain . 
  i met a lot of refugees who did n't know that tap water here was even drinkable . 
   at the same time , i have to say , yes , there was confusion and slowness from hungary . 
  sometimes refugees had to wait long times at registration camps , so they got impatient . 
  maybe the goverment should have hired more workers to deal with registration instead of running anti-immigrant billboards . 
   fact is , there was n't a single case of police brutality against refugees . 
  [ there was ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/reporters-notebook/migrants/hungary-refugees-pepper-spray )  there was no lack of food and supplies in the refugee camps , but they did not want to go in there . 
  why ? 
  first of they were n't given directions , secondly they did n't want to register in hungary , which given the goverment 's rhetoric is understandable . 
   but actually budapest built so called transit zones , where they have access to water , mobile toilets , showers etc. 
  how many showers for how much people ? 
   austria takes no refugees they do . 
   orb\u00e1n is the demon , when slovak pm fico refuses accepting muslims into slovakia hungary refuses to accept any refugees , and orb\u00e1n specifically came out against muslims . 
   hungary builds a fence it 's akin to the iron curtain , but if spain , bulgaria or the uk construct similar things , that 's perfectly fine . 
  nobody said that they were fine . 
  criticism of [ spain ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/06/spain-security-morocco-territories-immigration ) , [ bulgaria ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/bulgaria-under-fire-over-anti-refugee-border-fence.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=69269&amp;newscatid=351 ) . 
  calais a different case completly because it seals of private property which is also highly dangerous for refugees . 
   but you know , hungarians are the assholes , where no attack happened . 
  no attack at all . 
  except some violence against individuals and when football fans throw petards bombs among refugees . 
   he only said that most of them are economic migrants , since they leave safe turkey , the eu member greece , and serbia where there 's no war either . 
  the un does n't consider this countries safe for refugees . 
   and even some of the rapid decision changes in the way the refugees are handled ( board trains - do n't board trains - now again yes , albeit only domestic ones ) were due to germany 's policies everything is the fault of germany . 
   were there misunderstandings , confusion , shortage of interpreters ( the latter is much better now ) ? 
  sure , there were . 
  was this also the fault of eu , germany or whose ? 
  it 's the goverments . 
  they did nothing , nothing to help refugees . 
   i would really want germany/austria to come forward and tell hungarian authorities what is expected by them , on a practical policy level . 
  i thought orb\u00e1n said that hungary is a soverign nation , so why does he need someone to tell him want to do . 
  also quit whining and stop parroting the offical propaganda as if hungary were the victim here . 
  our goverment is uncooperative , uneuropean and deserves every bit of criticism . 
  this is the same goverment who said that we are half-asian who ca n't cooperate willfuly but only if there is enough force to coerce us into . 
  well syriza in a bad shape , but they might win the election , do n't write them down !, 
   1 million of people more on social benefits every year sure because they ca n't work , do n't want to work , and such , amirite ? 
  that the world media is controlled by liberals ( mainly george soros ) and is biased againts our perfect conservative goverment . 
  every criticism of any legistation hungary recieves from brussels and the venice commison or anywhere is actually the opposition scheming who ca n't even organise themselves here , but on an international level they are like an unstoppable force . 
  the other one is more recent , that the current immigration crisis was intentionally constructed by usa to fuck up europe and the cia or other secret agencies are actively handing out money to migrants to get here . 
  also the public media is controlled by the goverment . 
  which is basically proven . 
  but they mostly used by separatists , are they not ? 
  it 's hard to draw a direct comparison , because it 's a complex issue . 
  yeah irredentism is stupid , and people who claim it are usually dicks . 
  however , on the other hand there should be autonomy for hungarian people in slovakia or romania . 
  however i think that they can only achieve this on their own , because people in those states might feel themselves threatened if we push them to do it . 
  well the nazi comprasions are probably a little far . 
  more like if they had wwi relics or maps of germany with the old borders . 
  or if a foreign politican had some photos of basque/catalonian flags published while visiting spain . 
  27 or 18 ( eurozone ), 
  i think it probably has to do a lot with the fact that historically romanians , slovakians and croatians who were living in the kingdom hungary had a common slav identity and were accepted as such for the most part . 
  although i 'm not an expert . 
  interestingly a lot of different ethnicities were totally assimilated : the jasz people , the izamelites , the kylfings ( norse or finnic people ) and the kabars , probably more . 
  maybe . 
  or the country would have collapsed because there is not enough people in it . 
  a lot of hungarian kings invited different groups to the kingdom of hungary out of neccesity . 
  if there was n't for agressive hungarisation they might have been assimilated on their own , or at least had a `` hungarian '' identity besides there own . 
  wow that contradiction never dawned me .
