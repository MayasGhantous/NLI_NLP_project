  of course it increased , because we have now an audi and a mercedes factory just in hungary . 
  but now eastern european trucker and delivery companies will be forced to pay * western * wage . 
  imagine the outcry from example audi if they were ** forced to pay the same for a worker in ingolstadt and in gy\u0151r . 
  ** they now force us to do the opposite thing just to eliminate competitions for western companies and if the companies go bankrupt here where do you think the workers and jobs will go ? 
  that 's right , to almighty germany . 
  i 'm not sure about the history , but `` t\u00f3t '' means slovakian in hungarian . 
  it 's not used for serbs , croats , slovenes etc. 
  `` t\u00f3torsz\u00e1g '' just means the country of the t\u00f3ts . 
  ( like germany is n\u00e9metorsz\u00e1g , france is franciaorsz\u00e1g , italy is olaszorsz\u00e1g and so on . ), 
  aye , `` southern slav '' does explain it , thanks . 
  looked it up , [ t\u00f3th is the 4th most common ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_most_common_surnames_in_europe#slovakia ) . 
  so it 's still in `` use '' too . 
  i always wondered how come horv\u00e1th became the most common surname in slovakia . 
  it 's not that it 's hungarian ( 7/10 most commons are of that origin ) . 
  but why croat , why not t\u00f3th for example . 
  ( horv\u00e1th means croatian , if somebody did n't knew . ), 
  so destroying the only place where eastern europeans can compete with western companies . 
  competition with western companies led to the still infant eastern european industry die after being forced to compete directly with we . 
  which led to a massive industrial decline . 
  looks like direct market competition is only good if it favours western europe . 
  rev\u00edzi\u00f3 \u2122 ^ any ^ time ^ now, 
  another episode of getting upset about nothing . 
  we have exchanged our gold for currency too . 
  however if i remember correctly we have diversified it , not just euro . 
  another map where the butthurt belt is clearly visible . 
   0.3 yuck , at least the czech have only 0.9 too , so it 's okay . 
   as we do n't surrender or compromise if you believe statistics about how many people would be willing to defend their country , we would surrender faster than france in ww2 . 
  machines are just a piece of metal without people operating them . 
  pacifist populations wo n't win wars . 
  brass\u00f3 belongs to romania today , therefore he had only the purest daco-thracian blood in his veins , not even a drop of hungarian . 
  / s  in 1452 he originally offered his services to the byzantines , but emperor constantine xi could not afford his high salary ha !, 
  did n't know this piece of history though , thanks for sharing . 
  hungarian cannon ? 
  what did we do now again . 
   rue de constantinople deus most definitely vult . 
  only 436 ? 
  stop being a bigot !, 
  okay , so first of all . 
  the atlantic is on the same level if not lower than breitbart . 
  that being said . 
   in reality , orb\u00e1n 's `` refugees '' have been moving to hungary , and budapest in particular , for years . 
  a small clique of identitarians , or aggrieved nationalists from sweden , the united kingdom , the united states , france [ no ? ], 
  ( http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scottish-fascist-booted-out-hungary-10519747 ) also we ca n't dictate who lives here and who does n't . 
  unless you want us to forcefully remove them . 
   ** far-right ** fidesz party ??? 
  journalism at its finest . 
   prioritizing the preservation of `` hungary for the hungarians . '' as every self respecting party should in their own countries . 
  i doubt you take this article seriously either . 
  looks really modern that 's for sure . 
  expected something a lot more ... habsburg-ish ? 
  cringy people who roleplay as fascists . 
  good riddance . 
  because those lands were inhabited by russians . 
  the only reason it belonged to ukraine was because brezhnev draw them that way during some vodka induced conference . 
  thinking the soviet union will never fall anyways . 
  anyways , the `` they broke the law so we will broke them too '' is not an european way of solving problems . 
  so ukraine is allowed to do illegal things and should not be critized , but the same rules do not apply to russia ? 
  edit : if it was / s , proceed as usual and feel free to laugh at my lack of ability to see sarcasm . 
  if-if-if . 
  what ** if ** next day i learned to fly ? 
  is m1 now suddenly responsible for everything everyone is saying ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rose_revolution how should i ? 
  it was a tool to damage the soviet control in hungary and the rest of the eastern block . 
  which was eventually good for us , but not for the soviets . 
  after a rebellion in 1711 hungary was allowed to keep her constitutional autonomy , had a diet , national assembly etc so it 's not like it was `` just '' austria . 
  but yes you are partly right ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ :(, 
  croatia under ** austrian ** monarchy for hundreds of years severely triggered . 
  was soros described as a jewish parasite by m1 or not ? 
  it 's funny because in this case he supported the georgians to suppress the abhkaz and south ossetian people . 
  in your twisted `` case '' he would have supported the soviet union in 1956 . 
  you can see the borders . 
  organisations which were sponsored by him helped to increase tensions . 
  yes , you are not being antisemitic if you quote something from the main kampf while writing an article about it . 
  do you think people are communist if they quite from der kapital ? 
  what kind of lala land do you live in ? 
  yes they did say that khamenei described soros as a `` zionist multi-billionaire '' . 
  on irans topic ( * which was a 20 second at most * ) they have quoted new york times there . 
  where they have discussed how did organisations sponsored by soros broke out a rebellion in georgia . 
  which damaged irans leadership . 
  what kind of viewpoint are you talking about , what they said was factually correct and they did n't say that soros is a `` zionist multi-billionaire '' . 
  just quoted what the ayatollah said in a new york times article . 
  what you stated in your first comment was false and deceiving, 
  yes , american media quoted all of trumps ridiculous shits too , that does n't mean they agree with it . 
  a , they have quoted a religious head , not the supreme leader . 
  b , the source used by that part was the new york times stop spreading bullshit . 
  they just test their battle readiness/response time . 
  that 's not what happened . 
  they did a report about organisations that try to influence politics in different countries . 
  ( something that was factually correct , regardless of the intentions behind the report . ), 
  on iran it noted that the previous leader said those organisations worked against the government . 
  that was a small part of the report , they talked about it for less then 20 seconds , 2 sentences . 
  i could n't open the link for some reasons on my mobile or mac , anyways ... 
  it 's really good and all that foreigners support the idea that they are free migrate into our societies no questions asked . 
  now let 's ask the natives . 
  they will sit there , circle jerk about muh evil jooz and that is the end of it . 
  if the elections were held today he would still win by 2/3 , the second party would be jobbik . 
  so he does n't need such help . 
  also i doubt a little insignificant country like ours would influence such decisions . 
  keep your tinfoil hat in the drawer for now . 
  there are clubs for a bunch of weird shit and conspiracies .
