  2 thousand people are protesting for a hour in a city of 1 million . 
  on sunday . 
  i think orb\u00e1n will be fine . 
  well said , sadly you will be down voted , this is r/europe after all . 
   yes it is . 
  and are you saying it 's somehow ok to do it ? 
  you said we are not a democracy because fidesz did some * minor * garrymandering . 
  usa does it alllll the time . 
  is it a democracy or na because of that ? 
  that was my question . 
   they wanted to change the law to prevent a person being prime minister twice . 
  so either you are lying , or you just took over the lie that the constitutional court said . 
  like i was saying , they are actively trying to prevent people from hearing their voice . 
  you would have to alter the ** constitution ** for that , not just enact a law which says * muh we hate orban so only 2 terms * . 
  it 's not like the party had any support it was just a campaign stunt . 
  i trust the constitutional court more than you in these matters . 
   how do you know what the people wanted or did n't want ? 
  maybe the majority wanted the olympics . 
  now we will never know . 
  the government denied the democratic right of the people to have a vote on the issue . 
  and they did this just because they were afraid of the political damage should the people vote unfavorably for them . 
  you know who is afraid of the people ? 
  dictators . 
  did every nation made a referendum about organising the olympics or no ? 
  it became clear that it would be a financial burden , many people were against it and it became clear that another city will probably win it . 
   last year 's migrant thing was also about soros ? 
  they blamed that on him too , for a good reason . 
   their freedom does not remove the responsibility of hungary to treat human beings with dignity . 
  even if they are voluntarily in concentration camps , those are still concentration camps . 
  you should ask yourself why do they still remain in horrible concentration camps if they are free to leave ? 
  perhaps the alternative is even worse ? 
  we treat them with dignity , those `` terrible '' concentration camps are not bad at all . 
  too good for my liking in fact . 
   perhaps the alternative is even worse ? 
  yes it would be terrible for them to move back to their shitholes and not suck the swedish or german welfare system . 
   i will run you over with a car but it will be sloooow , so it 's ok . you can run into me at 1/km an hour , i 'll be fine . 
  the electricity is not lethal in it , so i do n't get your point . 
   even if you have no empathy with people who are suffering , hungary is signatory to several treaties which require it to treat refugees with dignity . 
  the next time historical situation changes and we become the side that is suffering , we will need to hope there will be people who wo n't remember how we behaved now . 
  i have empathy with people who are in syria trying to defend their homeland . 
  i do n't have empathy with people who just came there to live off the achievements of european people . 
   how will be remembered probably as a nation who did n't become a minority in their own country by 2100 . 
  yes . 
  yes , see above . 
   germany , because we are a drain on its economy . 
  we are n't damaging merkel too much politically , so she tossed us into the garbage only now , and now 2 years ago when orban started shitting all over our allies . 
  the workers we provide are good for their economy . 
  the things we buy are good for their economy . 
  the factories they can set up here are good for their economy . 
  there is a reason we are in the eu and it 's not rainbow and sunshine . 
   so the majority did n't give a fuck about this non-issue . 
  maybe fidesz should concentrate on hospitals and education and improve the lives of hungarian taxpayers , instead of always fighting an invisible foreign enemy . 
  ** half ** of the people voted , more did n't because 1 , we knew it will be an easy +80 % no . 
  2 , aaaaall of the opposition said to be absent . 
  how is it not the majority , this has been the hot topic since 2015 . 
  what are you even talking about ? 
   the us electoral system is different from the hungarian , so your comparison makes no sense . 
  it 's different , but garrymandering is garrymandering . 
   does n't matter how small a party is . 
  technically , i myself should be able to start a referendum . 
  the court should only ensure that the question is valid , and then let me try and collect the 100 thousand signatures . 
  that 's all the court is supposed to do . 
  currently , it effectively blocks every question that does n't suit the party . 
  they wanted to hold a referendum to change the constitution . 
  the court ruled that they are not allowed to do that , \u00e9rted ? 
   they opposed the referendum with tooth and nails , and when it became inevitable they pulled the plug and denied the people its voice . 
  yes they did , but did n't go through with something the people did n't want , explain me how is this dictatorship . 
   that sentence makes no sense . 
  you said we find new enemies every year , this soros thing has been going on for a while . 
   read the comment i was replying to . 
  op was saying soros met with some eu guy which means the guy is soros ' puppet . 
  i satirized the same with putin and orban . 
  i see . 
   tell me 1 instance in the last 1000 years when it was good to keep russia close ? 
  for us ? 
  probably never , cause we were at the wrong side of the dick every time . 
  but for various nations ? 
  many times . 
  we should not say collectively fuck russia just because germany demands it . 
  if it 's not in our national interest , we should not . 
   you do n't know what most people would do . 
  polls are clear . 
   do you care if people are treated like animals by the hungarian government in hungary ? 
  people whom we have nothing in common who despise our culture ? 
  not the slightest bit , they are free to leave anytime they want so stop branding them as `` concentration camps '' . 
   wrong . 
  the law says it will be the government 's fault . 
  try putting up an electric fence yourself and see what happens when you fry someone . 
  but it 's not leeethal . 
   you really should reevaluate how important we are . 
  hungary is an insignificant little shithole with less than 10 million people , and a drain on the eu economy . 
  of course we are not a heavyweight . 
  but the german industry needs ee badly . 
   drain on the eu economy eu economy ? 
  most certainly . 
  but it 's profitable for germany so who the hell cares . 
   proof ? 
  last i checked , the referendum failed because not enough people were interested in the issue . 
  yes , not enough people because the whole opposition boycotted it to be invalid and the results were obvious from the start . 
  even tho they did n't want to vote yes either , because that would 've diminished the remaining support they had .
