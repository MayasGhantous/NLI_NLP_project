  vw had record sales in 2016 despite the diesel scandal , people care about quality , not pollution . 
   the solution is easy : abolish this eu directive . 
  in that case , refugees would n't have a need for human traffickers and could just pay to use legal , cheap and safe methods to reach the eu . 
  there they can claim their right to legally apply for asylum and trained eu officials can determine if their request is valid or not . 
  problem solved , no human trafficking anymore . 
  next month : 300k africans have arrived to italy without papers , more to come . 
  sorry for being personal , but your naivity never fails to amaze me . 
  which cee does ? 
  yeah i would like to see a bunch of european men die so that arabs can fuck their countries up yet again in another 5 years too, 
  and it will all go away because people like you enable others to abuse the system . 
  well good thing is that at this pace countries will not uphold said convention for long . 
  traffipax , or trafi short, 
  and what will happen in 50 years ? 
  will we bring in even more people to sustain this even bigger population ? 
  this solution is not sustainable in the long run, 
  what goal post are you talking about ? 
  i do n't deem it to be just , i just accept that we have tried and lost . 
  the ussr * could * come in and fuck everything up . 
  we were powerless to resist for long , yes . 
  what determines `` extreme left '' and `` extreme right '' ? 
  does the trashing of hamburg counts as one offence ? 
  not all of africa , but a significant portion of it . 
   colonial powers need to fix the mess they 've created in africa so they have no reason to leave africa anymore . 
  no , they absolutely do n't have to . 
  they however should if it 's in their interest , in case they do n't want to do it , they have every right in this world to stop it and shield themselves from the consequences . 
   letting them come to europe is a temporary relief it 's not a relief for the european people thus should be stopped . 
  ** european ** union should do what is in the interest of the ** european ** people , not what their feels dictate them . 
  this is not natural selection . 
  it is self inflicted disadvantage that you practice because some politician/media figure , filthy rich and with access to a ton of resources , told you so . 
  in geopolitics you make what is most beneficial for * you * , not by some moral guidance invite people whom will be a disadvantage and drain on your resources . 
  the reason you left it because your argument will be reduced to moral relativism which will eventually boil down to `` give up your resources to x because that is the * right thing * to do . 
  '' , thus being incredibly easy to attack . 
  uhh , what is this drivel ? 
  germany and france will take back cohesion funds if they want to , but we will and should do whatever is possible to stop that . 
  let alone that it is in the interest of germany too to keep the east in the union . 
   why should we give them money if we get nothing in return ? 
  most of the investment we have done so far with the aid were fooling around . 
  sure , we have to secure our mines and such on the continent but theres no need to give aid and transparent shit like these where we do n't have to . 
  because of scums who were thinking like me is why europe as strong as it is . 
  we lost , we payed the price . 
  i hate soviets and people who like communism . 
  what about it ? 
  so what ? 
  any major nation has the right to fuck up whatever shithole they feel like and then shield themselves from the consequences . 
  those nations have already received a lot of money from us anyways to rebuild their countries . 
  now they will starve and maybe die ? 
  too bad , not my problem and we should not damage out countries in the name of some greater good . 
  the right attitude when you are able to shield yourself from it . 
  luckily europe is shielded from africa with a sea and narrow crossing points . 
  therefore if theres will to keep them out , there is way . 
  do n't you have supermarkets to loot in hamburg ? 
   africa requires massive investment to dissuade immigration why ? 
  why should we give them money if we get nothing in return ? 
  are we some kind of hostages ? 
  immigrants ca n't be stopped at the border . 
  you just need the will to do it instead of playing around . 
   where do you think they will go ? 
  who cares ? 
  not our responsibility to care for the whole world . 
   orban is a nzi because how he is supressing the media care to give examples ? 
  yes , but no many families go to uk for 2.50 an hour . 
  mostly young men or women . 
  who would go to uk for 2.50 an hour ... at that point you might aswell stay in hungary and make that much . 
  because reddit would n't be reddit without daily bitching about drumpfie ^ im ^ sorry, 
  redditor for 3 minutes , commented 2 minutes ago . 
  really gets the noggin joggin, 
  i 'll help flucht out , 5 minutes this time . 
  i do n't get it , what will antifa will gain out of this ? 
  other than trashing the city and maybe looting . 
  what 's the point ? 
   to the other way around . 
  i do n't think that western europe not safe , i 'm fully aware that sweden is not some shakira worshipping wasteland , like some people do , but i do think that both `` parts '' are very safe . 
  that is if you do n't walk into areas where fucked up people live , but that is true for sweden , or any country for that matter . 
  gypsies are hungarian citizens so we ca n't deport them . 
  they are our baggage and have been for quite a while now ... 
  gypsies , so yes in a way immigrants . 
  gypsies , i thought that was obvious . 
  why else would be afraid at night ? 
  you 're afraid being robbed , attacked etc. 
   why do people come all the way from debrecen to do their violence in tat\u00e1rszentgy\u00f6rgy , by the way ? 
  no , tat\u00e1rszentgy\u00f6rgy has plenty of people why northeastern hungary is shit already . 
  not for long with that austrian military on the border . 
  who would be affected ? 
  in most of hungary there are no people who are prone to do violent crimes , budapest is mostly safe too expect one district , northeastern hungary would be bad for me yeah . 
  i would love to see how and where this was conducted regardless . 
  that 's all . 
  i suspect it was just budapest who lived in shitty districts . 
  portugal confirmed not european , shall we call the moortugal from now on ? 
  the point is the most heavily `` colonised '' countries came out far better off then not-colonised ones . 
  if you ca n't dismiss this by cherrypicking . 
  somalia is n't doing bad because of colonisation , but because of constant civil wars after europeans left . 
  the most developed countries on that continent are the ones which were most heavily colonised in the past . 
  think of south africa , nigeria . 
  rhodesia used to have the highest number of black middle class in africa and was a rich country , look where are they now . 
  by this logic people should be organising whites only festivals too ... jesus people are fucking stupid . 
   51-60 % where was it asked , in the middle of the desolate indian wasteland that is called northeastern hungary ? 
  going to need a source on that . 
  edit : source was provided after i commented , but i still do n't believe that it would be 50 % , unless they asked it in some shitty part of the capital or the afore mentioned region of hungary . 
  i 'm not saying it 's false , i just do n't see how 50 % is real , [ especially when by the global peace index we are 15th in the world . . ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_peace_index ) ahead of sweden , germany etc. 
   ethiopia was n't free from outside influence .
