  congratulations to the czech and slovak guys . 
  keep on growing broskis . 
   syria still grows huh . . 
  they have received 44.87 % of the votes , jobbik received 21 % and egy\u00fctt ( all leftists parties together . ), 
  i do n't care enough to look it up , but i guess of we count people who did n't vote i doubt macron would have passed 30 % either . 
   so , according to the health authorities of portugal , from january 1 to june 11 , 2017 , 327 cases of hepatitis a were registered , of which 91 % are men who have sex with men . 
  well , * technically * they are not wrong then . 
  russias homophobia is still despicable though . 
  we have opposition , jobbik , mszp and so on , people simply do n't vote them as much as they do for fidesz , femen is hardly an opposition to anything . 
  by an author who is heavily biased against orb\u00e1n . 
  pro-refugee ( he thinks we should let in everybody . ), 
  and pro-everything liberal yadda yadda . 
  has no answers to things , just `` muh orb\u00e1n '' . 
  he is no saint and i would like to see somebody else in his seat , somebody less corrupt but that 's not going to be the equally if not more corrupt left with their `` the rich should be paying ! '', 
  slogan ( yes , this is their slogan . ), 
  my favourite part was about how we sentenced that muslim guy to 10 years and how we have `` armed militias '' on the border with only a few weeks of training just so that some people can satisfy their hatred for refugees . 
  that was funny , or the one about the poor poor gypsies , not sure which one is more ridiculous . 
  his name is \u00c1rp\u00e1d `` schilling '' , memes write themselves . 
  they were funded by him , when he stopped it they became much less vocal , i hope they will be gone forever . 
  if they would have been funded by joe or jane , i would have said those . 
  haha that 's hilarious , thanks !, 
  they went downhill since soros stopped funding for launching femen israel , should be gone forever . 
  he deleted the comment , what did it say ? 
  you could say , but you ca n't provide any source on how much western companies profited off the accessibility of the hungarian market , just raw number on how much money we receive . 
  t. the guy who pmd me some random romanian bozgor shit . 
   too bad we 're also closer to the americans than you are , so what remains in father vlad . 
  good for you then my little brown friend , but i would prefer the eu over muricans every day . 
  i can hardly provide a link since there is no `` how much western companies profited in hungary in 2017 . '', 
  audi manufacturing here had a profit of 14 meuro profit only . 
  given that most of the profit not only comes from they manufacturing here , but being able to sell and buy goods inside the country without tariff . 
   then why you guys do n't ask for leaving the union ? 
  you know why ? 
  because you know that what you just said is utter bullshit . 
  if it 's bullshit then refute it . 
   http://ec.europa.eu/budget/fts/index_en.htm here you can see how thousands of millions of euros are poured into hungary from the eu . 
   the amounts of money which flow out from my country to the western europe in forms of dividents is massively more than what we get in the forms of eu funds . 
   the amounts of money which flow out from my country to the western europe in forms of dividents is massively more than what we get in the forms of eu funds . 
   the amounts of money which flow out from my country to the western europe in forms of dividents is massively more than what we get in the forms of eu funds . 
  i 've copied it three times , maybe it will get through what i have written above . 
  so virginia was granted by england to make up its own rules , still as part of their colony . 
  is that it ? 
  what about the rest of the 13 states ? 
  no it 's not . 
  the idea of freedom is timeless , but that idea is much older than the usa . 
   our system of government long predates our independence from britain . 
  but you were not self-governing in 1620 were you ? 
  this is what you stated and this was false . 
   you said `` washington dictates . '', 
  washington dictates = / = washington is a dictatorship . 
  the idea of freedom and guns predates the us of a too . 
   regardless , there 's no dictatorship . 
  did i say there was ? 
   1620 the american revolution started in 1775 , you declared independence in 1776 . 
  could you not edit each of your comments three times in the first 1-3 minutes and make me look ignoring part of your answers or do i have to ''  '' the whole of your comments every time before i reply ? 
  you did it twice already . 
  as if you did n't know under washington i meant the us , just like when in international politics people say london or berlin stated this or that they mean the uk and germany under it , respectively . 
   in our entire 400 years of government . 
  us was founded in 1600 til, 
  then what is it ? 
  the west has massively economicaly profited from the eastern expansion , germany and france probably more than any other western european country , the amounts of money which flow out from my country to the western europe in forms of dividents is massively more than what we get in the forms of eu funds . 
  at least they managed to get 5 of them out of trouble . 
  good to know we are doing our own thing finally and not what washington dictates . 
   and are you seriously hoping to be the west 's sweatshop ? 
  is that the ambition there ? 
  do better !, 
  at the moment we can work with what we have , if you make it harder for a hungarian construction company to do work abroad , you just took away an option from them , that 's it . 
  hungarian worker has an option to be employed by western companies if he chooses to do so . 
  where ee can compete is price . 
  this is how ee owned companies have a competitive edge . 
   african and gay ? 
  wrong and wrong . 
  you stated in one of your comments you were a black gay guy from cleveland . 
  you deleted it just like the second thing i linked in my first reply . 
  [ anyways , here it is how you think genociding whites is the `` solution '' . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/againsthatesubreddits/comments/6i5gpa/rphysical_removal_praises_antimuslim_terror/dj57twk/ ) again , calling me triggered while i 'm not will not get you far broski  it 's not like digging through your posts was a tiresome duty , like i said a goldmine of hypocrisy and bitterness . 
  10/10 would browse again . 
  yet when hungarian companies are outcompeted by western companies and thus hungarian people are layed off , should we tax or prevent western companies access to our markets ? 
  protectionism goes both ways . 
  did i say it triggered me ? 
  i just find it hilarious that an african gay guy comes to r/europe of all places to complain about muh racism . 
  while in another thread stating how muslims are a lot less homophobe then europeans . 
   no , if you 're opening a public business , you serve the public . 
  and that includes people your bigoted ass might not like . 
  stalked you a little , cause people like you are always a goldmine . 
  `` gay white men are ** unfortunately still white men ** , and are just as prone to not recognizing their white privilege as straight white men . 
  there 's a discrimination problem within the gay community , lgbt poc are often overlooked and disregarded . '', 
  [ link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/shitredditsays/comments/6imt1j/homophobia_in_the_black_community_can_not_even/dj7p9dk/ ) `` shut up white boy . '', 
  [ link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/blackpeopletwitter/comments/6im3im/ayyy_lmao_shout_out_to_my_space_nias/dj7fhpz/ ) also your ideas about how poor arabs are just fighting against evil zionists jews and how it makes things justifiable in r/islam really gets that nogging jogging too . 
  good . 
  na , that is their '' '' `` football '' '' '', 
  tl ; dr : people with similar backgrounds tend to stick together . 
  more news at 11 . 
  no he is not , but still an unpleasant person who tries to meddle in internal politics . 
  yes , orb\u00e1n needed a punching bag , soros gyurika is a saint and obviously wants the best for the european people . 
  europeans are and none of them want turkey in the eu . 
   not sure why was hungary let in to begin with . 
  same people , same culture , same religion . 
  the only european thing about turkey is the land west of istanbul . 
  down vote me , idc wo n't make it any less true . 
  you might not like their program , but they are the only one who have one .
