  what 's the worth of your privacy when compared to the unbridled truth that a candidate to become one of the most powerful people in the world did everything in their power to rig the race ?

  the whole idea of covering up women roots from the idea that if a man gets horny it 's the woman 's fault . 
  there is no greater objectification of women in the world than in the islamic world . 
  it 's symbolic of extreme misogyny . 
  no shit . 
  hmmmm ... who on earth would want central europe to become more friendly with russia ? 
  i 'm convinced the only reason trump said that mexico would pay for it was because it would distract the world from the ridiculous proposal that is the wall itself . 
  if you say `` i 'm gon na build a ** huge ** fuckin ' wall '' then people will jump in to talk about how unrealistic it is . 
  if you say `` i 'm gon na build a ** huge ** fuckin ' wall and mexico 's gon na pay ! '', 
  then everyone will instead jump in to talk about whether mexico would or would not pay for it .

  i hate that i wrote so much over something i hate to discuss, 
  `` the _______ are _______ that hate our ______ ! '', 
  fill the spaces in however you want . 
  fine , let my clarify myself . 
  i 'm upset that the trump administration was brought up . 
  if a post pops up on this subreddit and it 's to do with something that the trump administration said or did concerning europe , that 's entirely reasonable . 
  the problem i have here is that a conversation about a simple map meme somehow turned into a criticization of the trump administration . 
  i 'd rather not hear about him so damn often . 
  the `` alternative facts '' meme sprung up in an interview with k. conway in which they were discussing falsehoods said white house press secretary sean spicer . 
  just because trump himself did n't say it does n't completely take him out of the subject . 
  also , the interview in which the meme originated did involve trump quite a bit . 
  `` you did not answer the question of why ** the president asked the white house press secretary to come out in front of the podium for the first time and utter a falsehood ** . 
  by bringing up the alternative facts meme , someone else brought up the trump administration . 
  i know that that 's a conway quote , i just think it 'd be nice if a fifth of all threads did n't turn into something about trump . 
  goddammit , why are we going from meme to trump ? 
  do n't fucking do that to strangers .

  i do n't like it mainly because of the ` ia ' at the end . 
  it makes it sounds silly . 
  i feel like saying that most middle eastern and north african muslims are conservative is an understatement . 
  also , i do believe trump 's ban placed a priority on religious minorities to help them get in from those countries . 
  well it sounds silly .
