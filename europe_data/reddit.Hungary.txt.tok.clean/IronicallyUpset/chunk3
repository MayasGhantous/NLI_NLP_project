  i 'm surprised , i did n't expect the pvv to be quite so high up . 
  god bless, 
  exactly what i mean . 
  how do you convince a man he is wrong if he is already so convinced that he believes his god will let him into * heaven * for doing such a thing ? 
  really , number three ? 
  you ca n't convince a fanatic of how he 's wrong , never mind one so fanatical that they 've already committed a massacre . 
  i 'm reminded of a saying . 
  `` you can be so open minded that your brains fall out . '', 
  i 'm liberal , but all these stupid fucking politicians are pushing me further and further right . 
  this perfectly summarizes why i 'm against accepting migrants and refugees from the middle east and north africa . 
  you 're blind if you ca n't see that they 're coming from societies that perpetuate everything we fought against for so , so long and you 're delusional if you think they 'll try to integrate . 
  fucking deport them . 
  that link is gold . 
  binge it . 
  very true . 
  there 's a big difference between criticism and outright hate speech . 
  however , when criticism is banned , you know the world is fucked up . 
  i thought that the msm * was * biased ? 
  did n't they say again and again that trump had like a 0.8 percent chance to win or something to discourage trump voters ? 
  i had even heard that during the clinton and sanders debates there were polls asking the audience who they thought won and in most debates the majority thought sanders had won , while the msm kept going on and on about clinton 's `` victories '' . 
  trump is trash , but lots of people thought that he had even one or two good ideas . 
  either that or they just hated hillary to death . 
  or cognitive dissonance . 
  fuck those people . 
  let free speech be free . 
  we need a new crusade .

   eurabia ? 
  it 's good that terrorists are being caught , but i 'd much rather live in a world where no terrorists are caught because there is no terrorism . 
  i think it 's very good that it 's happening , but very , very bad that it ** has ** to happen . 
  * thank god *, 
   one-sided liberal propaganda the pot calling the kettle black . 
  yes . 
  god help us . 
  why the fuck is cyprus split ? 
   implying the french are gay i wo n't disagree . 
   ( christian ) roma gypsies `` i asked god for a bike , but i know god does n't work that way . 
  so i stole a bike and asked for forgiveness . '', 
  thanks, 
  it 's alright , coincidentally it makes them look like even bigger dicks . 
  i think it 's a group of people who would count as victims in a hate crime , like the disabled and gays .

  the russians have a notorious black market for cheese .

  why not both ? 
  they will ** never ** integrate . 
  taking them in in the first place was a massively naive mistake . 
  now , all we can hope for is deportation . 
  thank god, 
  the quran is supposed to be the literal unabridged word of god , while the bible is a collection of books of various genres that are all divinely inspired in some way . 
  the bible contains violence in its histories but that 's not supposed to be a promotion of violence , any more than the song of solomon is supposed to be a promotion of comparing your wife 's breasts to castle towers . 
  i 'm not a turk mate , i 'm a shitposter .

   said he regretted the decision of the three member state `` ** not to show no solidarity ** and to ignore our repeated calls to participate in this common effort '' .
