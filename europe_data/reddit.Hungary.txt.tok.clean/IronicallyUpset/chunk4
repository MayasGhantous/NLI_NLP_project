  holy shit , for a second i thought everyone was sitting * beside * their spouses , not opposite them . 
  the age differences are wild, 
  it 's good to suspect but not without evidence . 
  contrary to popular beliefs about soros , he 's * not * a muslim-lizard-jew-from-jupiter . 
  i 'm copy-pasting this from another thread . 
   in 1998 , soros , whose aggressive currency trades were blamed for destroying the thai and malaysian economies in the asian financial crisis a year earlier , turned his attention to attacking hong kong markets . 
  on that occasion , hong kong , backed by beijing , faced him with an unprecedented hk$ 118 billion stock-buying spree to prop up stock prices and defend the currency peg in august 1998 . 
   `` many are worried that soros could attack china , the yuan and the hong kong dollar as he did to ... the baht , but i do n't think he still has that power . ''  the people 's bank of china controls the onshore yuan market and carries huge influence in the offshore yuan market in hong kong , making it hard for soros to develop shorting strategies against the currency , he added . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/1906325/how-beijing-and-hong-kong-sent-billionaire-george-soros-packing ) or , you know : [ here 's how george soros broke the bank of thailand ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/how-george-soros-broke-the-bank-of-thailand-2016-9 ) [ 1997 asian financial crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_asian_financial_crisis ) not shady enough ? 
  it gets better . 
   dr. mahathir has reserved his most trenchant comments for global currency traders , particularly george soros , an american currency hedge-fund operator and philanthropist . 
  even before their invited speeches at the world bank-imf annual meetings in ** hong kong in september 1997 , dr. mahathir derided mr. soros and other currency speculators as wealthy people who use their money to force developing countries `` to submit to the dictatorship of international manipulators . 
  '' ** mahathir expressed his own country 's interest in a more international economy but one with protection `` from self-serving rogues and international brigandage . '', 
   ** george soros , whose open society foundation funds anti-slorc burma activist groups in the u.s. and other countries , was one of the most vocal opponents of the country 's admission into asean . 
  ** perhaps unsurprisingly , conspiracy theorists claimed that soros ' actions in the currency market led to the collapse of the thai baht on july 2 and the subsequent fall of other asean countries ' currencies . 
  this was likened to a similar speculative attack soros led on the british pound sterling in september 1992 .

  because for some reason soros acting in a manner akin to war-profiteers , which he also is , is never met with the condemnations the transgression apparently warrants .
