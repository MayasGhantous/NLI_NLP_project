  his 3 brothers fell , one near debrecen torn apart by artillery fire . 
  i know about my ancestry , but i am also proud slovak :p  my ancestors were deported from ungv\u00e1r / uzhhorod after wwii , but as far as know they were ethnic hungarians . 
  damn , latvia has balls, 
  yeah i know how these transformations work . 
  everyone skews the results to favor them . 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_transylvania#/media/file:northern_transylvania_ethnic_map.svg ) shows the same thing in north transylvania . 
  also , the danube as a natural border makes a lot of sense , but the linguistic border is much farther north even [ today ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:slovakia_2011_ethnic.png ) , after slovakization . 
  i honestly ca n't understand what the people thought when they drew this border . 
  it kept the same minorities but turned the situation the other way around . 
  yes , because romanians cant pronounce ` prst ' . 
  ( hungarians could n't either , we dont use that word fortunately ) . 
  we use \u00fc to make it pronounceable , for example the city brno we call br\u00fcnn, 
  also , horthy refused to let hitler move troops through hungary to invade poland in 1939 . 
  exact quote \u201e i would sooner blow up the rail lines than to participate in an attack on poland . '', 
  i agree that you guys needed a country , that 's cool , but why did you take the areas that were hungarian majority in the south ? 
  the areas which were ceded back in 1938 . 
  ( not zakarpattia ), 
   even though religion does n't really play a big part in politics . 
  though they banned shops being open on sunday so that `` people can go to church '', 
  he said the old buildings werent rebuit . 
  probably soc-real buildings were built instead . 
  i know , like in hrvatska . 
   as i said lot of languages have this syllabic r. sanskrit has it too , as in vrkas ` wolf ', 
  i guess dialectal differences . 
  some people pronounce it with a schwa , others do it without it . 
  that is phonologically a syllabic consonant, 
  no , in slovak there are long syllabic consonants :  / r , l / can be syllabic : / r\u0329 , l\u0329 / . 
  when they are long ( indicated in the spelling with the acute accent : \u0155 and \u013a ) , they are always syllabic , e.g. 
  vlk ( wolf ) , prst ( finger ) , \u0161tvr\u0165 ( quarter ) , krk ( neck ) , bisyllabic v\u013a\u010da -- v\u013a-\u010da ( wolfling ) , v\u0155ba -- v\u0155-ba ( willow-tree ) , etc. 
  from wikipedia , slovak phonology for the forvo you sent , it 's definitely [ kr\u0329tek ] , i do n't hear the schwa there, 
  oh i did n't know that though ... 
  so it 's not a true syllabic r ? 
  is the long \u0155 in slovak a true one ? 
  are there any languages with true syllabic [ r ] s ? 
  but , would n't this be pronounceable in slovak like `` kvrv '' or `` cvrv '' ? 
  with the ` r ' being the vowel ? 
  ( i know in welsh w is a vowel but in slovak , czech and and a bunch of other languages ` r ' can be a vowel too , right ? ), 
  do n't worry it 's not a problem  ( also heatwaves are shit , i can relate to that ), 
  it 's okay , 
  but hungarian has no compatible languages ; _ ; ( aside from some random siberian people ) that doesnt mean we are so different a culture . 
  poland , because the traditional friendship and everything . 
  austria and croatia because shared history , and the neighboring places : slovakia , zakarpatia , transylvania and vojvodina because theres a bunch of hungarians there so i kind of naturally feel connected to them, 
   you can speak a different language than english as your mother tongue i dont know in what world you live in but in europe almost everybody speaks it as a second language , its specifically the us where its their first language, 
  no hungary ? 
  im disappoint, 
  he has nationalism cb ... 
  well the purpose would that people dont try to live and be rich off of politics . 
  it happens way too much here in hungary that politicians do jack shit but get a lot of money for that, 
  let me introduce you to the [ french revolutionary calendar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_republican_calendar ), 
  aka revised trianon . 
  i 'm okay with that . 
  and every politician must be payed minimal wage . 
  makes sense . 
  thanks , 
   isis  in egypt what did i miss ? 
  i thought they were syria & iraq ? 
  i stated directly that i was talking about the word singer . 
  i know that there 's a lot of words that have / \u014b\u0261 / , but there 's a lot which have simple / \u014b / intervocally too , like singer / si\u014b\u0279\u0329 / , but not finger / fi\u014bg\u0279\u0329 / . 
  i wanted to point out that / \u014b / is a phoneme in english so it would not be too difficult for them, 
  you do n't really pronounce the g in english either , so in si ** ng ** er it would be same as in finnish , except it would n't be a geminate . 
  ( this is an accent thing though , some do pronounce the g ), 
  the weird thing is , this is n't even a negative thing . 
  people just should n't dislike other dialects , which say things differently . 
  i think `` i mostly hear it at work '' kind of implies it . 
  people disagree with the fact that you heard these words ? 
  what, 
  why are people downvoting you ? 
  all you said was that you do hear these words . 
   th\u00e9 spotted the french, 
  exactly, 
  / r/nocontext, 
  but the hungarian word comes from one single root ` szent ' with affixes and suffixes . 
  ( i cant parse it myself though , fellow hungarians plox ), 
  that does n't mean your native langauge ca n't be related to arabic . 
  [ maltese ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maltese_language ) is . 
  for all 2 of them ? 
  and for budapest it 'd be vienna \\* shudder \\*, 
   slovakia , hungary , and romania together also sounds like constant infighting , tho . 
  i think it should be something like , everybody keeps their armies as is , but it will all be called divisions ( not sure about terminology here ) or the eu army , which can be relocated if needed . 
  so a local part of the army is always headed by its respective state , but the eu would get to overlook them . 
  nope , it comes from the exact same root as every other indoeuropean langauge on the map, 
  also we invented computers , pens , matches , dynamos , non-euclydian geometry , hospital hygiene , radio , also nuclear bombs , and carburetors , rubik 's cubes and transformators . 
  also hungarians designed the ford model t , vw beetle , lots of alfa romeo and ferrari cars , some lunar rovers and the sojourner rover on mars . 
  there 's a shitton to be proud of . 
  e : i 'm not bragging , just demostrating to my fellow hungarian what to be proud of . 
  you guys are cool too, 
  rekt, 
  plus both dakotas, 
  emojis that are gay couples, 
  just curious  i know circassians exist , ( thanks to eu4 ) , though i did n't know how many of them existed today  it 's pretty cool to see you around , 
  i 've never seen a circassian flair before ... are you circassian ? 
  it 's because hungarian and basque have different origins than other languages , but have loanwords from the same origin e : / u/dinapati beat me to it ... 
  that 's very misleading though . 
  it 's teh-ya or with an american accent teh-yo with a short ` o ' like in ` hot ' . 
  though all this shit would be unnecessary if people bothered to learn [ ipa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_phonetic_alphabet ) : [ ` t\u025bj\u0252 ] . 
  i ca n't understand why it 's not obligatory to learn it in school . 
  well , til, 
  p\u00e1linka is better . 
  i 'm gon na steal this, 
  exactly .
