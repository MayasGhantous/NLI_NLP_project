  i think he meant poland as in the nationstate , not the medieval kingdom, 
  the point would be to make a system in which they ca n't . 
  i 'm pretty sure you 're not aware what worker ownership means . 
  it 's when you work and * are n't * forced to give away part or most of what you produce . 
  which has not been tried , and especially not been the case in the eastern block , as such it 's silly to make such assumptions . 
   and i 'm pretty glad it isnt , tbh you 're glad that you have to give the value of your work to a company ( or the state , whatever ) and have no control over what they use it for , alright . 
  idk . 
  communism is when the workers are in control of the means of production . 
  saying that this was the case in the eastern block , that 's the nicest meme, 
  well the most important part would be to seize church property such as churches and mosques . 
  they could be used as homes for the poor and homeless and refugees maybe , better than having that brainwash thing go on on a weekly basis, 
  exactly , but that is a technicality . 
  for a layman , that is still a genocide, 
  / r/operationstreisand, 
  shit , sorry , quoted the wrong part :  according to the legally binding verdict of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia , federal army and serbian police after the nato bombing of yugoslavia 24 march 1999 , systematically attacked villages with albanian population , abused , robbed and killed civilians , ordering them to go to albania or montenegro , burning their houses and destroying by their property . 
  [ 40 ] within the campaign of violence , albanians were mass expelled from their homes , murdered , sexually assaulted , and their religious buildings destroyed . 
  serbian forces committed numerous war crimes during the implementation of `` joint criminal enterprise '' whose aim was to `` through the use of violence and terror , force a significant number of kosovo albanians to leave their homes , across the border , the state government to retain control over kosovo '' . 
  [ 27 ] ethnic cleansing of the albanian population is performed by the following model : first the army surrounded a place , then followed the shelling , then the police entered the village , and often with them and the army , and then crimes occurs ( murders , rapes , beatings , expulsions ... ) . 
   numerous war crimes were committed by serbian military and serbian paramilitary forces during the yugoslav wars . 
  the crimes included ** massacres , ethnic cleansing , systematic rape , crimes against humanity and genocide ** . 
  the international court of justice , cleared the republic of serbia of direct involvement in genocide , but found that it had ** failed to prevent mass killings , rapes , and ethnic cleansing ** . 
  [ [ 31 ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/idusl26638724._ch_.2400 ) ] from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbia_in_the_yugoslav_wars#war_crimes ), 
  legal definition of genocide :  `` article ii : in the present convention , genocide means any of the following acts committed ** with intent to destroy , in whole or in part ** , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group , as such :  ( a ) killing members of the group ;  ( b ) causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group ;  ( c ) deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part ;  ( d ) imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group ;  ( e ) forcibly transferring children of the group to another group . 
  what happened in kosovo was the same as a genocide , but their intention was not to kill them all , just kill most and force the rest out of their homes and out the country . 
  the definition of a genocide is the same , just without the intent of sparing some . 
  it is a technicality, 
  i agree with you here , but why do you keep on arguing with him here ? 
  its not like youre gon na change his view, 
  this is a technicality . 
  doing killings and rape and arson is still good enough reason for them to declare independence and in laymans terms it could be called a genocide . 
  pretty much every party named such a generic name like `` national party '' is just populists . 
  just look at the us . 
  `` republicans '' and `` democrats '' , like wtf . 
  how can one say so little with a party name, 
  same, 
   `` i do n't like you , but the law protects your rights , well , we 'll amend the law '' . 
  i was under the impression that this is how it works everywhere . 
  when people do something they should n't , you make a law, 
  what disclaimers ? 
   similarly to hungary and the huns . 
  to be fair though , hungarian is an exonym only . 
  roma is an endonym that many gypsies do n't even like to be called as, 
   germany undertook to reduce its armed forces to no more than 370,000 personnel , no more than 345,000 of whom were to be in the army and the air force . 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_on_the_final_settlement_with_respect_to_germany#treaty ) meant to say big military btw . 
  idk about romania but in hungary language classes for hungarian native speakers are not in any way suitable to non-native speakers . 
  ( i mean seriously , a non-native speaker would n't leran a single word of hungarian , we usually just study grammar and spelling ) we have a way different type of schooling for non-native speakers for this very reason , known as hungarian as foreign language . 
  i 'm not counting them as something that left the eu , when it did n't even start trying to leave . 
  yeah . 
  the british government has always been trying to boycott the eu trying to get closer and closer, 
  you give great examples of why it is great to be rich in america . 
  maybe you should focus on the incredible inequality instead , which is highest in the developed world in america . 
  being poor there sucks way more than it does elsewhere, 
  totally . 
  a sort-of-country of 500 million people and the largest combined gdp in the world , wouldnt be able to make a competent army , from two already-competent armies * and * the powerhouse that is germany ( which on its own is literally not allowed by the us to have a good military ) ... 
  but youre a 100 % sure that it would be just a pathetic little army , comparable to the current estonian army , amirite, 
  i mean are the heads of actually important things like the army and diplomacy and cia and stuff also changed during an election ? 
  the what ? 
  idk i started to call many things from different countries jobbik . 
  i mean what is le pen in france at its core ? 
  what is afd in germany ? 
  i dont see a reason to make a distinction there, 
  its pretty unfortunate . 
  the member states have too much power, 
  it might be called that , but that is absolutely not a category . 
  you teach a language differently to native speakers than non native speakers . 
  if you do the latter , its called teaching it as a foreign language . 
  literally no one knows these days . 
  i thought they preferred the term globalism, 
  oh yes the great balkan cities of venice and milan, 
   how different was us culture from uk one in 1776 ? 
  just enough so that the french could make them a country by financing their efforts for autonomy and/or representation, 
  especially the comment sections amirite ? 
  i 'm getting me some popcorn in here, 
  if there 's one business that 's gon na prosper for a long time , that 's the irredentist map business in the balkans, 
  he has an extremely competent team behind him regardless , it 's not like he 's gon na do everything diplomatic himself . 
  he can fail , i 'm not saying he is n't gon na , but let 's not make it out like he already did, 
  nation is a cultural construct , not a political one . 
  nation * can * be a political tool , just like religion can , but that does n't make it political in origin . 
  then do n't blame the fucking eu for it . 
  the eu would have a great army , the individual armies sucks absolute ass , every single one except france and the uk . 
  i do not support small countries like my own to spend more on the military for no reason . 
  the eu army , sure , but that is n't a thing yet . 
  maybe help it become a thing if you want that to happen, 
  i think if they befriend trump , they wo n't care anymore , and the baltic might be a bit more safe ( since they are part of nato , which counts as us 's personal sphere of influence ) , as they would n't want to upset the us, 
  that they * do n't want to be called slovak * , that takes some explaining usually . 
  much like when you 're offended that your country is n't holland but the netherlands , you also need to explain them . 
   erdogan the ruler of a tiny economical power is dictating the eu what to do , and the eu accommodates him . 
  since the eu did n't ( yet ) get the power to do anything about that ( no common foreign policy ) , therefore the member states are at fault for this  all the eu had to do was stand up to him , blockade the turkish point of departures . 
  of course , for that the eu would need approval from the member states , which they do n't give them . 
  you expect them to do things they are n't capable and/or allowed to do . 
  why did n't the vatican save the christians in isis territory ? 
   the eu is at peace essentially because the us is financing most of nato . 
  the us is maintaining fiercely its sphere of influence , which for some reason is more important for them than their own citizens ' well-being . 
  whatever . 
  by the way , again , the eu is * not fucking allowed * to have an army or foreign policy , or unified policy toward its own member states . 
  so this stuff is a burden of the member states  the baltic states could be invaded at any moment by russia nah  the eu could n't dream of moving a finger without a support from the us guess fucking what , the eu ca n't move anything because * it has no army * . 
  again , thanks a lot member states, 
  you might be right . 
  though their attitude and especially to assimilation and integration makes them look more french/american-y . 
  i get it that you can assimilate and become < any nationality  in a few generations ( or even the same one , though that takes serious effort ) , but that 's not the same as getting citizenship , or being born here .
