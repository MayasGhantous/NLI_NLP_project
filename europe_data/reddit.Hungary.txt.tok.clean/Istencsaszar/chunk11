  xenophobia is the grammar nazi approved word , but racism works just fine . 
  technically ? 
  xenophobia/xenophobic is the word you 're looking for . 
  though tbh racism can be used that way too, 
  ceau\u015fescu jokes used to be popular too, 
  pls do n't vote them ** fidesz-kdnp ** : conservatives and christians . 
  their name is misleading ( fidesz - union of young democrats , in reality it 's a party of old conservatives ) ** mszp ** : general left-wing party . 
  ** lmp ** : green-liberal party ** egy\u00fctt ** : supposedly a leftist coalition against fidesz , which nobody relevant joined ** dk ** : a leftist party of a previous mszp minister ( gyurcs\u00e1ny ) who lost the trust of most citizens because of a scandal . 
  he is popular among the elderly . 
  ** k\u00e9tfark\u00fa kutya p\u00e1rt ** : ( two-tailed dog party ) joke party which promises free beer for everyone and a space station . 
  they make a lot from donations which they use to parody the government 's manipulative ads . 
  [ like this one ] ( http://40.media.tumblr.com/a505fd0a216e8f50be0a86d4112b7732/tumblr_inline_nrhybmsy7q1t5ld5u_1280.jpg ) . 
  i advise you to vote them , they 're the only promising of the bunch, 
  scientific studies . 
  but this is not a scientific study , it 's more like a political survey . 
  in those you would ask people from different areas you 'll get very different results . 
  500 answers which are most likely from the same area do n't represent it accurately no matter how hard you 're trying . 
  asking 500 people is no way representative of 10 million . 
  they asked 0.005 % of the population and make statements about the entirety of it . 
  yup , this survey totally proves that hungarians are anti-semitic non-europeans who should not be eu ... 
  believe it or not i could go around in town asking people and get completely different results . 
  you have a hungarian family ? 
  great . 
   does that mean you know more about hungarian society as whole than someone who lives in it and was born into it ? 
  the study you have shown does n't even tell how many people they asked , yet it states as a fact that 3.4 million people are anti-semitic . 
  not sure why they downvote you , it really is an old symbol . 
  i knew i was n't the only one, 
  thank you for telling me what the society i live in is like . 
  it 's good to know that the society i was born in is actually `` deeply antisemitic '' despite my experiences . 
  ( also do you even know why there are so many jobbik and fidesz voters ? 
  because the left side here is incompetent . 
  they are fractured into a myriad little parties , which makes people strategically vote for jobbik , just to avoid a fidesz victory , which turned out to be complete shit ), 
  i meant something like ` freedomize china ' or ` fuck commie rooskies ' war . 
  so something that 's really major , and/or could hurt europe . 
  we should stick to them being allies for as long as possible i think, 
  no we should n't . 
  the fact that europe can become a superpower on its own does n't mean we should n't stay allied to the us . . ( unless they start some stupid ass pointless war , obviously ), 
  that was an attempt by like 3-4 retards , not the government ... also it was never taken seriously . 
  it was mostly to satisfy jobbik voters and deter them from voting jobbik and instead vote fidesz . 
  also , please stop acting like a butthurt retard . 
  if anything , your unconditional hate towards hungary is showing . . 
  they do n't * want * to integrate . 
  they were raised in their own social circle , and were taught that they were supposed to steal and live off of that . 
  and they do , with success . 
  they do n't want to work , to have a job , to integrate . 
  they want to continue their life as is , which is unacceptable by our social standards . 
  the real virtuous circle you 're talking about is more like this : poverty  stealing  social isolation  more stealing  more isolation . 
   a goverment that supports anti semitism tell me more about our government please . 
  dont feed the troll ... 
  i think you misunderstood his comment . 
  he pointed out that in the us there are n't even natives left to complain about their land being given away, 
  i like liechtenstein ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  so true . . 
  lets get to the happy end already, 
  no , is wrong . 
  hungary must not into gender, 
  i did n't say poland was more sober , 
   ** ethical crusader **  spies on others to prove his point . 
  great ethics you got there, 
  relevant username, 
  nope , he 's drinking with poland but he 's so drunk he does n't even realize where he is . 
  definitely . 
  romanians do n't trust hungarians , hungarians do n't trust romanians . 
  i 'm not surprised at all that romanians do n't support autonomy . 
  i do n't really do . 
  probably i was overreacting that . 
  well , indeed they did coexist peacefully . 
  ofc they were foreign rulers and they drafted all the children but what they really cared about was taxes . 
  they did n't even force the religion . 
  this is a part of history which i learn at school , so i believe i know what i 'm talking about here . 
  generally the ottomans were seen as better than the habsburgs later ( excluding the ah monarchy because at that point we were almost independent ), 
  greater hungary supporters are all morons though . 
  they are generally jobbik supporters ( aka nazis ) . 
  they like to ignore that croatia-slavonia was n't even an integral part of greater hungary , it was autonomous and virtually no hungarians lived there . 
  i agree with the relations thing , too . 
  generally in hungary children are taught that trianon was a fucking disaster , and especially now orb\u00e1n made a memorial day to `` remember '' trianon every fucking year . 
  i do n't know why . 
  you 're right about this most definitely , and i agree . 
  romanians were not tolerated by the church and generally the nobles . 
  but . 
  the point i was trying to make was that before the age of nationalism the people did n't think of any land as their nation 's land , so the average person would n't think it 's x nation 's land where everyone of y nationality should n't be there . 
  back then the idea was less about nationality , they knew this was z king 's land , which they could use , and the fact that the guy next door just so happened to be of a different nation than them , they cared much less . 
  ( not the same with religion though . ), 
  obviously not the same way as in modern times , i 'm not saying there were n't xenophobics then , but in those times xenophobic hatred was much less common because of the lack of nationalism/nationalistic ideas ( i may be completely wrong though . 
  i 'm really interested in romanians ' views on this subject ), 
  well , different people tolerate different levels of advertisement . 
  in my opinion this was a little too much . . 
  i do n't see why this is relevant for now though . 
  i was trying to make a point which was about the medieval society , yet you 're constantly talking about the habsburg rule in transylvania . 
  the very article you just liked says this :  although eastern orthodox romanians were not permitted local self-government like the szekelys and saxons in transylvania and the cumans and iazyges in hungary , the romanian ruling class ( nobilis kenezius ) had the same rights as the hungarian nobilis conditionarius . 
   the szeklers and romanians were not regarded as newcomers ( colonists ) in transylvania , and were granted partial privileges . 
  i understand the point you 're trying to make and yes , romanians were treated terribly in the 18th and 19th centuries , but when i 'm talking about the middle ages i 'm talking about that , the middle ages . 
   second-class citizens . 
  in the medieval ? 
  like , in the feudal system ? 
  what rights did hungarian peasants have that romanian peasants did n't ? 
  ( i ignore upper classes because that was like 2-3 % of society and they had all the rights ), 
  do you have any counter-examples ? 
  i think it 's unnecessary to advertise that sub so obnoxiously . 
  it 's a good sub , anyone who wants to go there will .
