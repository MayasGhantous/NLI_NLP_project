  it does n't really make it as special as olympia imho, 
  i ca n't imagine how bored they must 've been to do this, 
  yeah , exactly . 
  budapest basically had a civil movement to get the government withdraw from the olympics or at least organize a referendum . 
  tfw the intellectual circles in budapest are better than paris or la. 
   to athens why in the world would it be athens ? 
  it should be olympia if anything, 
  yup, 
   they filmed it themselves . 
  they caught a guy , he allegedly had contacts with terrorists . 
  they brought in a hollow tube and a barbwire . 
  they put a tube inside of him . 
  in his anus . 
  then they put the barbed wire inside this tube . 
  then they took the tube out . 
  then they were slowly pulling the barbed wire out . 
  when i saw that video and realized they had already brought the tube and the barbed wire i broke . 
  yeah , this basically convinced me that russia needs to invade chechnya again , or at least overthrow kadyrov somehow . 
  north of the caucasus though , so technically europe . 
  though chechnya is the place where the `` technically '' in `` technically europe '' applies the most, 
  i like how well it 's showing that there 's literally nothing interesting on the great hungarian plains, 
  i did n't read it either but afaik it goes with the old legend that hunor and magyar were two brothers from whom the huns and hungarians respectively are descended . 
  i 'm not entirely sure tho, 
  that is n't a bad idea either, 
  it 's possible that it 's that way etymologically , but my version would make it symmetric . 
  oh , right ... but you 're special slavs < 3, 
  you slavs never interact with us , that 's why you do n't see this side of ours, 
  why ? 
  have you ever heard of this thing called a joke, 
   if i write \u0433\u0435\u043d\u0430 instead of \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430 , do i then write \u0433\u044a\u0435\u043d\u0430 instead of \u0433\u0435\u043d\u0430 ? 
  yeah , exactly  i had no goal to get rid of diacritics . 
  ha\u010deks make it look slavic . 
  okay , that 's your decision , i was just pointing out that it would make it look and sound interesting ( in my opinion at least ), 
  i 've been looking at the wiki page on russian phonology , it says that those are not phonemic distinctions , so you could do something like substitute every \u0448 with \u043a\u044c and every \u0436 with \u0433\u044c . 
  so for example instead of \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430 , you 'd write \u0433\u0435\u043d\u0430 . 
  and the other way round , instead of \u043a\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c , \u043a\u044a\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c . 
  and then you transliterate * this * , instead of the original . 
  you could easily get rid of two letters with diacritics this way . 
  damn , op , should 've used the fact that / k / and / g / do n't have soft variants ( or at least ignored the exceptions ) and made / \u0283 / and / \u0292 / their soft variants . 
  could 've made a really interesting romanization . 
  orthodox is n't even supposed to be cyrillic , that should be the greek alphabet . 
  it was heretical even among the orthodox, 
  and ? 
  you could still read mongolian for example . 
  see - it 's useful, 
  there . 
  i would 've found it hard to believe if there were n't any turks, 
  the gesta claims that they are descended from the huns directly, 
   where ? 
  a shitton of places . 
  [ here ] ( http://bibviz.com/ ) 's an entire website dedicated to it, 
  the bible contradicts itself a lot , so it would only make sense for the church to contradict the bible too , since that 's what the bible also does, 
   demographics :  arabs : 55 % , kurds : 45 % and there 's not a single turk in the province ? 
  i do n't even understand why people feel the need to do this . 
  i would understand from hardcore conservatives , maybe , since their ideology is closer to it . 
  but from liberals of all things ? 
  just no, 
  the politicians do n't give a shit if the people starve . 
  plus , they 'd only need to feed 50 % + 1 person . 
  that 's the name in english . 
  lake constance . 
  that 's not something you can just change, 
  how . 
  explain to me how the fuck will the entire population die because there 's too many humans ? 
  we do n't even have the stickers here anymore, 
  local crime, 
  this sounds like something out of the commie era in hungary, 
  now you 're the one being naughty maybe you deserve a bit of spanking too, 
  this is n't how you make me come to mommy, 
  i 'm sure you can figure it out, 
  what do you mean ? 
  what are you on about ? 
  the censuses in the 1960s were made by hungarians ? 
  nice one, 
  this is a typical case of the `` who is n't with us is against us '' mentality . 
  we are n't talking about budapest . 
  oradea , satu mare and cluj were hungarian majority until the ceausescu era . 
  look at the actual census data on the wiki pages of each city, 
  even those that have another citizenship as well ? 
   you say `` nation '' , i say `` ethnic group '' . 
  no , you still say nation for one particular ethnic group . 
  not by ignoring my entire point either, 
  `` the french do it too so that makes it true '' the french constitution is the very embodiment of the cancer that is hardcore , religious nationalism . 
  this is one of the dogmas of nationalism . 
  you go around telling people this bullshit the same way the fucking church goes around telling people that god is real ... your entire reasoning is `` hey see it 's written here '' ... and then you refer to another document that also writes the same fucking bullshit . 
  that 's not how facts work , this is a textbook example of appeal to authority , which is a pretty severe logical fallacy, 
  oh you sweet summer child , you are n't very skilled in the arts of corruption , are you ? 
  you are literally arguing that some guy who wrote it down that `` everyone is romanian '' makes it somehow fact ? 
  well , so did most of the balkans actually , and hungary, 
   my problem is with using a different color when mentioning `` nation '' in the title . 
  i guess that 's just nomenclature , though . 
  in hungary for example the minorities are called nations . 
  although it seems unfair that a romanian born in hungary ( yes , those exist ) can be romanian by nationality , but a hungarian born in romania ca n't ... and this excuse :  we 're defined by constitution as a ( single ) nation state . 
  is just downright stupid . 
  `` some law says that you are infact < not what you are  '' ... laws do n't change facts, 
   the szekely origin is unknown and they are first mentioned in the 15th century sz\u00e9kelys were mentioned in the gesta hungarorum , early 1200s, 
   cluj , oradea , satu mare are all filled with hungarians from the villages ... what are you on about ? 
  all three of those cities were hungarian majority until the 1970s . 
  no hungarian peasants moved there , in fact it was specifically the romanian communities that moved en masse into cities during the communist era . 
  well stop funding it then,
