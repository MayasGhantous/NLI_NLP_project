  the eu ib a nutshell is a yuri ? 
  i can get behind that, 
   i think that the eus main problem is that member state citizens did n't get to vote in . 
  yes they did, 
  you are literally asking people to do what is worse for them, 
  i wonder - does that mean that nintendos will be cheaper ? 
  i ca n't tell you how much i loathe this `` all positive '' naming . 
  fucking tell it how it is : yellow stands for `` absolute shit '' and orange for `` even more shit '', 
  i would n't think less of a company for that , quite the opposite actually , as i could see they see their employees as human beings and not barbie dolls they can play dress up with . 
  the way it goes is that no one gives a shit, 
  we have turkey on our border and russia, 
  fidesz 's program is `` we will continue '' , while everyone else 's is basically `` we are not the fidesz '', 
  this is such a fucking meme , man . . oh no it 's ** the germanz ** ... you 're basically talking about them the same way feminists do about `` the patriarchy '', 
  it would actually achieve the exact opposite result, 
  i do n't think that 's really the case . 
  i 've seen more patriotism from western europeans than non-neonazi eastern europeans ... 
  i do n't think it 's a majority anymore . 
  certain countries like czechia and estonia are majority atheist for example . 
  i would guess that it would be plurality christian , but then again we 're basically in the dark in that regard because certain countries do n't let anyone make the statistics, 
  they do n't even have a fucking program , give me a break ... and they 're not new either, 
  bus drivers are supposed to be professional ? 
  yeah , i 'm saying that slavery is a different concept . 
  regular capitalism , i.e. 
  capitalists paying workers less than the value of their labor and profiting off the difference is not the same as slavery, 
  this . 
  people should really stop calling ordinary capitalism slavery . 
  they were still butthurt about 1703-1711, 
   why do you think it 's the only organization that can guarantee freedom of movement ? 
  well , yugoslavia clearly also could , while we 're at it . 
  are n't hypotheticals fun ? 
  freedom of movement is absolutely not obvious . 
  these countries are not in the eu, 
  to the other neighborhoods ? 
  and then how would they travel ? 
  there 's not just `` border gore '' , the areas would be disjoint and there would still be massive minorities in each country, 
  anyone who has one of those is already in western europe or planning to go there, 
   not hating just trolling !, 
  obviously . 
  i was too :p such is life in eastern europe  you should farm orban and his clique for it . . oh . . wait !, 
  i was thinking of buying him one for his birthday or something, 
  you dropped this : \\ \\, 
  it 's politicians ? 
  then i suppose you do n't have any spines ? 
  it would tell me that the guy actually bothered to look through what flairs there are and chose one to represent him, 
  yes, 
  if they 're a few days old account then it does , no flair is almost definitely a troll account and not all flair choices are nations at all, 
  nobody here does that , unsurprisingly you 're an 11 day old account . 
  troll harder, 
   we are not becoming german servants is not `` criticism '' , no matter how you stretch the meaning of that word . 
  it 's quite simple idiocy, 
  you are shitposting with no flair and expect to be taken seriously ? 
  honestly , they do n't really look good . 
  like , at all . 
  potato quality does n't help either, 
  because there 's a limit for how long a straight can be on an f1 track , and the whole straight would be too long . 
  goddamn norway, 
   armies . 
   lithuania pick one, 
  i think `` thank fuck '' is a viable alternative . 
   thank ** god ** hmm, 
  we 're gon na need a subreddit for that ... / r/rfpba ? 
  i do n't see the problem, 
   how can there be too much water in a drink . 
  well if it 's alcoholic then it 's pretty obvious how , or if it 's a syrup, 
  no , i 've just seen it like ten times already, 
  i wo n't even click that , it 's so incredibly obvious what it 's gon na be, 
  why do they eat pizza with fork and knife wtf, 
  as much as this is a fun meme , it 's not true . 
  english spelling has its rules , and `` z '' can never ever be pronounced / s / or / \u03b8 / . 
   redditor for 10 days, 
  pro tip : if you 're question starts with `` am i the only one '' then the answer is almost definitely no . 
   ps : adopt the euro !, 
  i wish, 
  consuming is not necessarily consuming actual products . 
  you can also consume services, 
  i would rather enjoy the last few days when the weather is still bearable here . 
  if one is a soldier , do they just expect not dying ? 
  can we get these annoying spellchecker bots out of here ? 
  they just spam irrelevant shit everywhere ( also inb4 some uncreative asshole comments '' / r/botsrights haha u dum '' ), 
  zaragoza looks way more disgusting tbqh, 
  because it 's spelt as it 's pronounced in english, 
  i am technically catholic , actually, 
  a different part of the track , but yes, 
  nope, 
  eli5 what is corpus christi ? 
   leftists are free to deny and openly do so the mass murders of the marxists all over the 20th century no we 're not , idiot, 
  tbqh that was even more annoying than this, 
  i think what i was referring to was that people just say `` bosnian '' , like it means much ... 
  especially if they also mix it up with bosniak, 
  i think even that , they just define it by their location . 
  so if you happen to be born there , you 're that and that 's it , maybe you just need an address in the respective administrative division to be considered one . 
  i think in english you do n't make a difference between the citizen of a country and a person of that nationality . 
  it 's incredibly confusing, 
  you should n't either , it 's fun ... the others just do n't get it, 
  you like to do friendly banter a lot , i suppose some people just think you 're insulting them ? 
  idk, 
  lol i can see why that would be the case, 
  that 's actually a blessing : think about it , the terrorists wo n't think to attack us either, 
  yup . 
  seems legit,
