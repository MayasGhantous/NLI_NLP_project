  where would you put the corsican word then ? 
   board games that are usually red vs blue . 
  real board games are white vs black, 
  you 've probably been called a romanian though, 
  yeah i do n't think that would even be considered news anymore . 
  orb\u00e1n is doing the whole corruption thing without hiding it anymore . 
  he knows full well that the other parties are too incompetent to matter so he knows he can get away with it, 
   dunajskej stredem that 's like , practically hungary though . 
  btw no , have n't seen the photo and i do n't care either . 
  i 'm more concerned with his friendship with putin, 
  also vend = slovene, 
  nagy does n't mean tall , it means big, 
  the link was still purple for me from the last time it was posted . 
  ... they found two types of land , and named them accordingly, 
  yeah . . we hate you too , foreigners, 
  same with the hungarian one !, 
  corruption bros ? 
  yeah , alternatively . . i find the more popular etymology more likely , which is that it comes from latin, 
   ogre comes from the word `` hungarians '' , since the magyars were among the most savage barbarians to ravage europe . 
  like , which ones ? 
  also til, 
  yeah but that part was added later . 
  the original name of the place is simply * porn\u00f3 *, 
   if humans `` save '' the trees then it 's no longer a primeval forest . 
  if human let the trees fucking die then it 's not a primeval forest anymore either . 
  not even a regular forest, 
  and [ her\u00e9d ] ( https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/her%c3%a9d ) , literally `` your testicle '' and [ porn\u00f3ap\u00e1ti ] ( https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/porn%c3%b3ap%c3%a1ti ) , which i think does n't need explanation, 
  fyi it 's pronounced `` nad\u030ckutas\u030c '', 
  why is white with a black background ? 
  xkcd is supposed to be black text on a white background, 
  so , who 's the mongol now , slovakia ? 
  yup , it 's peking no doubt, 
  i know that feel bro, 
  running some small country must be such a chill job . 
  is the assistant with the silly walk included ? 
  enforcing something in a voluntary system is an oxymoron . 
  you either enforce it , or it 's voluntary . 
  international law is voluntary , so it 's a joke , cause there 's nothing to enforce it . 
  i do n't plan to enforce anything , since i do n't care . 
  just the government one . 
  the rest is fine, 
  and that is also why international law is a joke . 
  yup, 
  you mean maria theresia ? 
  i think we made up for her by providing her . . khm . . royal consorts, 
  this constant spamming of `` content '' about dna stuff is getting increasingly creepy, 
  goddammit , now you stole someone else 's rightful karma by replying to yourself . 
  seen this like four times already, 
  they 're like the north korea to our south korea, 
  it 's one in 10 . 
  not at all unlikely, 
  i mean clearly . 
  how did i not notice that before, 
  that would create bordergore , which is against international law . 
  colonies are always welcome, 
  the other banates which were also run by south slavs are not represented . 
  they just took one of the many banates . 
  most likely your arguments would also apply to the others . 
  and to the actual kingdom of croatia, 
   why has n't it been filmed into a this is sparta type movie yet ?? 
  because we 're eastern europeans bro . 
  nobody will ever make that movie . 
  the local film industries are shitty and anything they would make would basically be blasphemy , and the west just does n't give a shit . 
  also they want to see eastern europeans as racist and subhuman , they do n't want to see anything positive about us . 
  this was like , the golden age of feudalism . 
  pretty much every place was autonomous , because every feudal lord had some sort of autonomy . 
  in hungary for example every county at the time was autonomous, 
  tbf there was no autonomy for romanians back in the day either . 
  he means that his ancestors are a map, 
  [ mfw ] ( https://i.redd.it/1cxdiownkiry.jpg ), 
  you have autonomy so chill, 
  yup . 
  and what 's displayed as `` serbia '' here was actually just the banat of macs\u00f3, 
  ** arouses ** moscow 's ** ire ** . . what the fuck , media . 
  ca n't these people write like a normal person does ? 
  to say that they make themselves look like cunts is an understatement here, 
  we are n't claiming anyone , they 're not subjects , they 're people , and and as such they call themselves what they want to call themselves . 
  and they clearly call themselves gypsies, 
  loving the language = / = studying in it . 
  would you rather have your potential top minds of the entire world study in your language and never get to shine , or have them study in a different one which would enable them access to much much more than your language ever could . 
   language is not just a tool for communication yes , yes it is . 
  especially in science , where different languages do n't matter , the actual matter that you study is the important part . 
  pretty much true for any language . 
  oh no , how dare they make those poor ** students ** learn something ?? 
  those fucking savages ? 
  i 'm not a nationalist in any sense of the word , but i do want latin back . 
  no , they can literally just put `` hungarian '' there . 
  it 's that easy, 
  gypsy . 
  that 's what they put on the census to `` nationality '' . 
  this is the same in hungary btw . 
  it 's probably the dumbest and most pretentious thing in the world to both assume that they are a nationality they clearly fucking are n't and even go as far as to think that you 're doing them a favor by considering them that . 
  like , does n't the fact that you think that you 're doing them a favor by considering them romanian/whatever else make you racist ? 
  these people are essentially assuming that it 's a courtesy from them to allow others into their superior culture . 
  not a coast ( c\u00f4te ) and not made of gold ( or ) . . voltaire would have a field day with this, 
  that 's pretty much always like that . 
  pretty sure , yeah . 
  the other version is to make little circles with your finger, 
  you posted this twice, 
  i think you meant to reply to someone else,
