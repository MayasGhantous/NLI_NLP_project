  well , it does both . 
   no , i am arguing that the majority of eu population should have an easier time in the eu ... by arguing about something that the majority of the eu 's population would never have to deal with either way ? 
   representatives of eu still come from all the countries yeah but no country would send a non-english speaker , so that means it 's still easier to get into the eu parliament from an english-speaking country , because you wo n't have to learn any language . 
  making laws is already ridiculously slow , so who gives a shit . 
  it 's not we have a quota for how many laws to pass , now do we ? 
   a non existing language being this triggered by the language our entire civilization used for centuries  none of your arguments make any sense other than your imaginary `` it would be kool '' . 
  you are literally arguing that speakers of certain language should be privileged and have an easier time with the eu . 
  this way , a speaker of a non-english language would need to work a lot harder to get into a good position in * the entity that fucking runs the eu * . . with latin , everyone has to work the same amount, 
  yes , i did . 
  i can type pretty much anything in latin if you give me enough time and the internet . 
  people who are paid to do it can too , unless they 're braindead, 
   actually learn it to a point where they are fluent since it 's laws they are writting , misinterpretations are not an option . 
  dictionaries exist , you know that right ? 
  they do n't need to be fluent whatsoever , as they would never have to utter a word of latin . 
  wiktionary has all the conjugation you will ever need and there 's wifi everywhere . 
  not that huge waste of money . 
  you would be translating to one more language , 31 instead of 30 ( ish ) . 
  but it would eliminate the need for debates about language really easily . 
  would you rather deal with a le pen-esque populist crying about how `` anglophone culture is taking over glorious european culture '' , or take this , rather easy option ? 
  what if china booms even more than it already did and mandarin makes english obsolete ? 
  then what you have is - once again - the eu would be , with its choice of language `` making the job of bureaucrats harder for no reason '' . 
  but no one needs to speak it , only the bureaucrats who make the laws and shit . 
  lawyers already speak latin pretty often , so it 's absolutely not an issue . 
  why would the average people need to speak latin because it 's the language laws were written in and were translated from ? 
  that 's like saying all christians have to speak aramaic . 
  for multiethnic countries a neutral language is needed . 
  english is not it , nor is any of the other eu official languages . 
  latin was official language in almost all parts of the eu at some time , so it 's pretty much the most neutral you can get, 
  official languages of the eu are just the collection of what the member states suggested . 
  i.e , choosing any of those would instantly be a dick move towards every single other one . 
  bureaucratic stuff should probably be in latin for example when the eu gets a constitution ( hopefully soon ) , then it should probably be in latin and translated to other languages from that, 
  if we counted second language speakers as well though , english would come first probably, 
  nice flair, 
  relevant flair, 
  i thought nazi collaborators were executed after ww2 , no ? 
   what nationalism is -- it 's an ideology of the dominant nation within a territory that purports its superiority over other nations . 
  that means other nations adjacent to it are lesser but also other , smaller nations that live on its territory are also considered second-class citizens very well put , though i would also add a clause about civic nationalism , wherein they outright deny that other nations can exist within their territory . 
  well in terms of irregular ass shit , the romance languages are king . 
  italian also has a similar thing ( e\u0300 stato is the simple past of both * essere * and * stare * ) . 
  also * ero * ( i was ) * sono stato * ( also `` i was '' ) * fui * ( also `` i was '' ) in hungarian we do n't have that much irregularity in words , mainly because the conjugations and the extra stuff you can add to the words are more extensive , so it 's more crucial that the root is fixed . 
  we have one thing though that might be interesting for you , the infinitive of our `` to be '' is always * lenni * , except in one very special case , in the very special phrase , * vanni van * ( `` as for being , there is '' ) , which you use when something * is * there but is n't as good as one might expect . 
  this is because the equivalent expression can be used with any verb , but it requires the verbs to start with the same sound in order to sound good . 
  there are some forms where you can conjugate with the other root to get a different meaning : ** vol ** t - ( he/she ) was ** le ** tt - ( he/she ) became, 
  hungarian , verb * lenni * ( to be ) ( \u00e9n ) ** va ** gyok ( i am ) ( \u00e9n ) ** lesz ** ek ( i will be ), 
   som of then were probably never used in a conversation outside of a mental asylum , but still . 
  eh , i would say that almost any grammatical form is instantly recognized by any speaker and they would be used too , if situations in which they would be needed would ever present themselves, 
   some common verbs takes from different roots we have that in hungarian too , the copula * lenni * takes forms using two different finno-ugric roots . 
   ` hearty welcome ' and a ` cordial reception ' literally mean the same thing , using germanic or latin roots respectively in hungarian you can do this with just the finno-ugric roots . 
  * sz\u00edv\u00e9lyes \u00fcdv\u00f6zlet * means the same as a * meleg k\u00e9zfog\u00e1s * or a * kedves k\u00f6sz\u00f6nt\u00e9s * or whatever else you happen to come up with . . synonyms are not unique to english, 
  except , the case endings do n't mean anything on their own and are never used in isolation, 
  that 's not how that works . 
   we do n't have separate prepositions , they go after the word . 
  same , though we mostly use the cases instead of prepositions, 
  way better than the stupid ass bourgeois holidays like `` the kings birthday '' or whatever . 
  did n't mean to , sorry, 
  that 's where you 're wrong buddy . 
  russia officially calls their minorities national minorities , which means they 're a different nationality , aka , not russians . 
  first , many hungarians living therr have hungarian citizenship , second , there is barely any conflict , unless some cunt comes around telling them they 're romanians . 
  that 's 1984-tier fucked up , and insanely nationalistic . 
  h comes from finno-ugric k , h\u00e1bor\u00fa is of disputed origin . 
  most think it 's ultimately related to the word hab ( originally meant wave ) , which is related to finnish kummuta, 
  ... now you speak a world language and everyone understands your language anywhere you go , unlike glorious hungarian which only a select few can ... it 's really fun , you 're missing out man, 
  yup . 
  almost all of these are used, 
  / r/firstworldproblems, 
  it 's educational content, 
  ca n't say it 's unreasonable ... plus it 's easier for the guys already know finnish, 
  everyone and their mother learns chinese and japanese , these are your usual hipster languages to learn . 
  hungarian is like , advanced hipster, 
   megkuty\u00e1sodotts\u00e1g\u00e1\u00e9ilag the worst part is , this is almost comprehensible even . 
  if you modify the \u00e1\u00e9 to a simple a , then i can legit imagine the word being used irl , something like :  hogyhogy visszaj\u00f6tt megn\u00e9zetni a macsk\u00e1j\u00e1t ? 
  fun ? 
  because indo-european languages are basically copies of each other so why bother learning effectively the same thing over and over again ? 
  uralic is a bigger family than finno-ugric , it 's not the same thing, 
  probably that . 
  we have the same situation in hungary as well, 
  because it 's better to avoid a conversation that is pretty much bound to be toxic, 
  do n't summon him, 
   as long as it 's done democratically i do n't think anyone will not recognise it . 
  not really . 
  this is politics , the only reason anyone does anything is to further their own personal interests . 
  seconded, 
  orb\u00e1n is n't intelligent , ever listened to any of his speeches ? 
  war , poverty , corruption, 
  weirdos, 
  depends . 
  they only need one token woman , and that spot might already be filled, 
   as a woman i 'm definitely pro women being locked up you are now a moderator of / r/mensrights, 
  sure , but it 's probably enough to do the basic stuff and give everyone some useless job . 
  may 1st . . the day of labor ? 
  sounds legit, 
  it 's just a few days off from may 1 , what 's the point, 
   chinese unemployment rate wow , communist country manages to keep unemployment low ? 
  what a surprise, 
  why does their parliament look like a classroom though, 
   nothing controlled by force is your own . 
  please do n't tell me you believe this unironically, 
   i do n't see any reason why a communist country ca n't have pride in their national identity and put the success of their own people first . 
  because they do n't , it 's completely detrimental to the very core of communist ideology . 
  it 's `` workers of the world , unite '' , not `` workers of a particular area , unite '',
