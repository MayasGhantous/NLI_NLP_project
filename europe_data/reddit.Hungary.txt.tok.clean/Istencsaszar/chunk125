   the upper class establishment representative ? 
  both were upper class as fuck, 
  probably depends on your skin color and other factors . 
  that 's not harassment . . 
  harassment is when they `` randomly select '' people for cavity searches and shit, 
  nasty . 
  rest in peace, 
  * insert relevant marx quote *, 
  and puerto rico as well, 
  [ working link here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guernica_ ( picasso \\ ) ), 
  nice whataboutism . 
  i 'd mistake you for a putinbot if you did n't have the flair, 
  prime minister , naturally, 
   which country does orban represents since 2010 ? 
  he does n't , that 's the presidents job  why is orban still in power ? 
  there has n't been any other guy anyone would 've wanted to vote for, 
  [ brezhnev-k\u00e1d\u00e1r is a much more iconic duo ] ( http://kep.cdn.indexvas.hu/1/0/295/2958/29581/2958124_8c0480810aa1f36dcf5ab0826d6dc91e_wm.jpg ), 
  thanks for demonstrating what typing on qwerty feels like . 
  naturally , the only logical keyboard layout , yup, 
  yeah, 
  it 's not really a productive idea to put any sort of labels to large groups of people like that in the first place , so, 
  it 's the gay propaganda guys !!!, 
  ! 44 ukraine is fascist confirmed !, 
  who does n't hate their workplace ? 
  orb\u00e1n = / = hungary , unlike what western media might lead you to believe, 
  pretty sure the situation is similar to hungary there as well : ie . 
  the educated people in the capital and maybe the major cities are smart enough to protest and all that, 
  still not ideal . 
  we could endorse the glorious phonetic spelling and swap `` european '' to `` yuropean '', 
   genocidal islamist run by some psycho  `` still better than muh worstoppressioninhistory ah '' slovakia_irl, 
   one ca n't mention islam in a negative context without fear of the ban hammer ? 
  criticism of retarded ideologies was never banned here, 
  elections are in 2018 fam , not 2020, 
  what about it ? 
  it 's a fence . 
  it would 've been placed there no matter where the border is . 
  he changed flairs because of a bet involving le pen winning the first round, 
  sweden is like capitalism city fam, 
  did sweden adopt the american education system ? 
  i do n't even remember the borders ever mattering, 
  that paris though ... 
  totally not a result of centuries of extreme centralization, 
  it 's a religion , it 's ok i guess, 
  the ideological background is scary , not the map . 
  maps change all the time , it was n't something you could do much about anyway, 
  we do n't really have enough data to be able to tell . 
  it 's likely that it was almost exactly 50-50, 
  you sure man ? 
  quick google search found me [ this ] ( https://islamicvirtues.com/2013/12/12/superiority-of-the-race-of-arabs-over-non-arabs/ ) and [ this ] ( https://irrationalislam.wordpress.com/2012/08/27/the-arabs-are-superior-in-islam/ ) . 
  did n't many arabs migrate from the middle east proper to the maghreb ? 
  especially during/after the conquests ? 
   misusing islam i believe the quran has some passages where it states that arabs ( not muslims , arabs ) are superior to others . 
  i remember reading that anyways  muslim = / = arab and vice versa obviously, 
  nope , it 's totally a name a normal black guy would choose for his permanent account :p, 
   insane levels of kurwa high kurva energy, 
  sounds awfully similar to the use of * kurva * and * geci * in hungarian, 
  thought they were usually called maghrebi arabs, 
  savage, 
  the guy literally has `` negro '' in his username . . 
  this was already the case when nationalism was much bigger , remember hitler also supported the little nazis in other countries , even if they were actually untermensch like croatia . . 
  kek, 
  so you 're saying that iceland should be removed from the map ? 
  that 's the only one that is n't mainland europe, 
  but would n't that mean that they think the irish are also british , therefore you would also take their opinion into account ? 
  yeah this is the family friendly version, 
  london is the city with the second most hungarians in the world, 
  they also played the soviet anthem and the internationale ( ironically , naturally ) ... 
  holy fuck i loathe the politicians that banned it so much . 
  i 'm so glad people got them to repel that bullshit law, 
  workers ' rights pls, 
  i know i 'm gon na regret talking to a religious nut , but let 's see : you know that the workers who work on sundays get to have their own days off on some other day , right ? 
  interesting . 
  in hungary this plant is called * n\u0151szirom * , which means `` woman 's petals '' . . 
  i mean that is pretty pervy too if you ask me, 
   and having a lot of sex well i 'm hooked . 
  where do i sign up ? 
  does n't stop pedants from bitching though , unfortunately . 
  do n't know how the fuck this happened but i got merkel ... though most of the questions did n't have an option i would 've agreed with wholeheartedly at all, 
  i ca n't comprehend how you came to this conclusion from what he said, 
  welp , none of them appeal much , the s&d seems acceptable , the others are either nutjobs or completely meaningless, 
  love how the badlinguistics is always upvoted while the only sane voice is downvoted to shit . 
  is n't that like , against the hippocratic oath anyway ? 
  or anyone else for that matter, 
  in a sane world that dad would n't see his kid again, 
  no , it 's obviously a finno-ugric loanword in baltic . 
  okay , sure , that 's fair, 
  i do n't think considering anything `` sacred '' is a good idea . 
  fired and forever remembered as a grandmaster of trolling . . 
  i 'd say it would be worth it, 
   remoaners kek the salt, 
  jesus , how is this controversial even , what the hell reddit . 
  you post this literally every other thread, 
  no , they are nationalities . 
  lol, 
  unacceptable . 
  ungarn must be in there, 
  i should read the comments i reply to, 
  yeah i know , but i believe that 's a pretty modern loanword , and there 's an older version that does come from the same root as `` hungaria '', 
  yeah, 
  people ca n't hate you when they do n't know you exist,
