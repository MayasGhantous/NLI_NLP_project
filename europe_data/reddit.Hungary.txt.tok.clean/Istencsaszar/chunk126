  inb4 triggered slovaks, 
  orb\u00e1n is just a [ napoleon from tesco ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wvr2p35soe&amp;ab_channel=b%c3%b6d%c5%91cstibor ) anyway, 
  or a girl orb\u00e1n . . whichever you prefer :p, 
   i must compensate my height with a strong personality . / s so you 're saying you 're like napoleon, 
  yeah but from an extra small 19-year old girl . . that must some high-pitched angry dog , much like ours, 
  we have a similar thing with slovak and romanian for example ... 
   the illegal sanctions on russia  illegal that 's such a buzzword these days . 
  not really a thing to be triggered this hard by , though . 
  it 's just some official state bullshit , in the end, 
  no it 's not the constitutional official language , no, 
  iran , saudi arabia , turkey . . 
  it 's perfectly fine to say that the gypsy language is one of hungary 's official languages, 
   it 's incredib ** i ** le i read that in a wonderful italian accent, 
  there 's gon na be such a fucking massive religious war , god dammit, 
  yeah , true , but also do n't forget that we had pretty huge limits to being able to vote , most people could n't vote in fact ... 
  i think it 's very fair to blame the ruling class and the rich of the era for the stuff that happened . 
  of course , they were hungarians , but the average peasant or working class hungarian/other nationality could never influence anything, 
  there were lots of interesting ideas as to how it could be made to work , sadly it was run by a bunch of ultraconservative fucks, 
  no there is n't , stop, 
  well it was kind of a massive disaster , yeah, 
  there , much more realistic already . 
  i always when people said that someone is `` spinning in their grave '' they meant around a different axis, 
  nice try bourgie, 
  shitty forced meme . 
   trotskyite  flair : * empress * does not compute ... ^ ^ ^ ^ fuckin ^ ^ ^ ^ bourgeois, 
  fidesz made it so that the only free tv channels in the country are the state channels . 
  he closed the main opposition newspaper, 
  hey that 's nice , sounds a bit like austria-hungary, 
  a welcome addition to my reaction faces folder, 
   i 'll take the british or the french was the british/french rule in egypt particularly bloody ? 
  eh , the world is pretty much broken already , china westernized, 
  which is what i would do if i wanted to be safe , yeah . 
  well yeah , to me it stood out because you used antioch to refer to it and not antakya ... in most media you would hear the turkish name only for some reason , even though the english one sounds a million times better ( not that antioch was in the news or anything , just the fact that western media overfetishizes using the native name for everything like it 's more culturally appreciative or some shit like that ), 
   antioch as a ck2 player it 's nice to hear that name once in a while , 
   reputable  newspaper choose one, 
   50 $ a year vpn definitely not paying money for that, 
  not really . 
  democracy is when you also suffer when other people are stupid and you were right all along, 
  i wonder whar that sounds like irl, 
  well they stopped those god damn heretics from killing good catholics at least / s, 
  really ? 
  i would n't be proud of that , but suit yourself, 
  nobody expects the reformed inquisition, 
   reformed eh , heretic either way , what 's the difference ? 
  damn protestant/greek catholic adult, 
  sure sure, 
  maybe you 're right, 
  what does he teach ? 
  why ? 
   that 's because usually people from your link are from a. . . flowerly ethnic background . 
  damn , you totally got the wrong impression of that pic , damn . 
  i was hoping you 'd have seen the series this is from ( you totally should btw ) , but this is a reference to [ snoopy ] ( https://az616578.vo.msecnd.net/files/responsive/embedded/any/desktop/2015/09/19/635782207663144808-1764026973_6af7fdfae164f7ecffa8161888a720be.jpg ) , come on now ...  kid whatever you say ... grandma ;p, 
  you 'll need me as a prosecutor , really ? 
  do i have to expect being called in to trials in romania regularly ? 
  also , why the floral clothes ? 
  `` it was possible for me to '' , `` i could do it '' , `` there was a chance '' ( in the sense `` i had a chance '' ) , `` there was an opportunity/possiblity '', 
  i 'm gon na have to disappoint you there , i 'm not gon na become a psychiatrist . . not a professional one anyway . 
  ( i can be something like [ this ] ( http://community.ew.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/episode-11-diane-patty.png ) though ) also , why would you need so much psychological help anyway ? 
  you do n't look like the type of person who would need it that much , i may be wrong though, 
   what 's so european about figuratively extending `` have '' to things that one does n't physically possess ? 
  while i do n't know , maybe i speak a non-ie language and pretty much every phrase that does the equivalent of that is non-native word-to-word translations from ie ? 
   `` who will run for president ? '', 
  `` i will run for president ! '', 
  `` who is running for president ? '', 
  `` i 'm running for president ''  `` how good will that taste ? '', 
  `` what is its taste like when it 's done '' , this obviously does n't work in english but i assume that 's how it goes in languages with no future tense, 
   i 'm sad . 
  lolol that particular combination of words makes me think you 're not * really * that sad :p, 
   tons of languages have such a concept as the accusative case , even outside of the ie family . 
  can you please comprehend what i wrote next time ? 
  i said ** the fact that it 's marked on all of them ** , ie . 
  on the pronoun , adjective and noun  it 's \u015di , not \u0161i . 
  makes no difference , you 're just a pedant . 
  also hugely ironic that a language thats supposed to be universal cant be typed on my keyboard . 
   but metaphor is hardly unique to indo-european again , comprehend what i 'm saying goddammit  i 'm not sure exactly what you 're referring to by this . 
  do you mean the possessive pronouns ? 
  the accusative on the pronouns ? 
  the fact that pronouns agree with nouns in case and number . 
  also the fact that nouns are pluralized after a word specifying their amount , now that i think of it . 
  those are some weird ass indo-european-inspired features . 
  at least you can still feel like a kid ... enjoy it while you can, 
   will happen in the future without having to specify exactly when it will be done that 's what the word `` later '' is for, 
  well then you have no word for `` it '' , the problem was n't solved , hell it just got worse, 
   an accusative case that 's marked exactly the same ( always by adding the same morpheme on the end ) on every noun and pronoun , as well as on adjectives the fact that it 's marked on all of them is pretty much indo-european already . 
   verbs that conjugate only for tense but not for person or number ( okay , i think danish and afrikaans have that ) english is also pretty much that with the one exception in the 3s and for the copula  no grammatical gender ... except the aforementioned `` li / \u0161i '' and the - ino ending , which are pretty much copied from ie languages . .  participle suffixes basically the latin thing  agglutinate implying that people actually do that . 
  the agglutination is incredibly niche . 
  on the other hand , we have the verbed possession ( havi ) , the case system , insane amounts of indo-european style phrases ( havi okazon for example ) , the conjugated personal pronouns , the whole `` prepositions '' thing , etc etc. 
   \u011ci exists ... `` it '' exists in english too , it 's actually even more disrespectful than the other two, 
  you can also say to that question - `` no , but i 'm doing it tomorrow '' - still works, 
   yeah ... not many people are shorter than me unfortunately . 
  is n't that actually good for girls ? 
  like , more guys to choose from if they want a guy that 's taller ... 
   you 're smaller than me . 
  well i 'm not tall but i do n't think you 're taller than i am :p  a damn smart one though . 
  you have called me a kid way too many times , it 's not justified at that age, 
   i 'm doing it means you 're doing it right now . 
  not necessarily . 
  that can refer to the future as well . 
  `` so are you going to germany in the end ? '', 
  clearly does n't refer to the present for example .
