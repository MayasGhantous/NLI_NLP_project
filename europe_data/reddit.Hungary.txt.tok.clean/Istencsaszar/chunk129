  english has completely useless words in this regard . 
  i would personally use nationality instead , but that is just misunderstood as `` citizenship '' . 
  ethnicity is misunderstood as `` race '' , so you have no way of actually expressing that concept . 
  literally 1984-tier, 
  is n't that literally the most common fetish ? 
   occitan did n't expect that to pop up here , but i have to agree . 
  occitan sounds amazing . 
  also a blatant copy of the 1956 hungarian revolution one, 
  it makes look like a pretentious asshole . 
  `` may your arms and legs break '', 
  i do n't think most people give it this much thought, 
  i do n't think we were gon na get rid of it the easy way anyway, 
  neither had any sort of effect . 
  both were stuff i heard on the news, 
  to be able to help with this , we should first recognize and be aware of our current situation . 
  which is undoubtedly that we are not on the economic and social level that we should be on . 
  that 's not about a city afaik, 
  they 're not foreigners, 
   this discussion i 've seen this exact discussion like a million times on reddit , i 'm not masochistic enough to actually read all these comments . 
  you said that you would be fine with changing the name of eurasia for whatever reason -  it would n't matter since no one would use that word , same way no one uses this one, 
  like , look at the answers here . 
  do you seriously think that i would believe some government office over actual people ? 
  do you regularly use the word eurasia , like , ever ? 
  i can literally not imagine any context where it would be useful, 
   i have no problem with a new name that would be fine by everyone . 
  implying anyone ever uses the word eurasia in any context besides this, 
  you know that governments will wildly overestimate the danger of being in certain places so that they ca n't get shit in the ( incredibly rare ) case that someone gets hurt ... they have literally no interest in providing accurate information there, 
  such people do n't exist , it 's pointless to even talk about . 
  knowledge of the language and academic qualifications . 
  basically these are the criteria that i would put for aspiring citizens . 
  you should go to paris . 
  those guys do that all the time . 
  like holy shit , literally stepping in front of a car without batting an eye, 
  does a russian 's brazilian sound portuguese ? 
  at least your username is relevant, 
  not european though, 
  [ this one , obviously ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iumb9e_zsy&amp;ab_channel=%23misshmusic ) ... there 's one made by some foreign guy too but meh, 
  just ... why, 
  well look , i 'm not jewish and the current government is n't really different from the one during the early stage of ww2 . 
  so for me that would n't exactly matter, 
  english , german and italian, 
   using j in latin reeee, 
  the old hungarian alphabet, 
  not this april , two years ago, 
  tfw you want to contribute to the chain but the alphabet you wan na use is not supported by reddit : /, 
  the closer it is to austria , the richer, 
  me too , i went there in april . 
  it was still unbearably hot \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  idk maybe somewhere in the northern mountains ? 
  that overpriced piece of shit restaurant chain next to their highways . 
  whats the name , march\u00e9 or something ? 
  all of them, 
  italy , with the ciabatta bread, 
  honestly , it does n't harm anyone , so why not ? 
  the only questionable part is whether it should be taxed or not , but i do n't think it matters that much . 
  the thing is , the taxes would only make politicians richer, 
  well the thing is , on * our * countryside , people would n't give a shit if it were n't legal , either , so it 's easier and cheaper to just not make it illegal, 
   we have government-owned liquor stores , you have to visit those if you want to get anything with an alcohol content of over ... meanwhile in hungary your neighbor brews p\u00e1linka with 80 % alcohol content and it 's legal, 
   retarded just because it 's not the case in your country ? 
  it 's worse than the laws in my country . 
  also i was assuming it 's something like 18, 
  well that sounds retarded , but okay . 
  from what age can you ? 
  okay i might have exaggerated a bit ( actually i have no idea of laws ) , but i know that you can be punished for stuff like vandalism , theft , assault , murder , manslaughter etc from 14 onwards . 
  14 is also the age of consent , basically the from which you are responsible for what you say . 
  and also the age at which you can get a license for a scooter and agricultural vehicles . 
  ( which includes the exact same course as getting the license for a car btw ), 
  dude a 14yo is exactly as responsible as an adult for their actions . 
  there 's no point in depriving them from rights if they share the same responsibilities anyway, 
  yeah here too , i actually did that at 14 , too, 
  i would support them wholeheartedly if they could secede and remain part of the eu . 
  in fact one of the most important things the eu should try to achieve is to make that possible for these two nations . 
  however , for now , we should maintain this ( unfavorable ) situation for the sake of the eu 's integrity, 
  this is literally what nomenclature means, 
  in hungarian that is not called carpathians , only the ring around the basin is the carpathians . 
  the middle parts are the * erd\u00e9lyi-k\u00f6z\u00e9phegys\u00e9g * ( transylvanian [ medium-high ] mountains ), 
  yeah , the rest of the carpathian basin . 
  and the parts that are populated by hungarians are a political issue , yes, 
  kaposv\u00e1r has 598.23 / km2 ( only because it includes a bunch of woods in the north and south , no idea why ) somogy county is barely barely populated at 52/km2 , i believe it 's the least dense county in the country hungary has 105.3 / km2 on average, 
  it 's pretty good but overpriced af, 
  here too, 
  no but it would be better that way, 
  besides the paid citizenship thing for `` investors '' , i have no problem with it, 
  legend, 
  it 's a present problem m8, 
  you think i did n't get that it was an eu4 reference ? 
  i have you tagged as `` fascist '' from earlier o_o, 
  because the eu is not a singular state unfortunately , just a bunch of rather incompetent countries, 
   i would like to vote for pro-european party but with tough anti-immigration policy from third countries . 
  these parties are non-existent i would like to start such a party tbqh, 
  fidesz ( center-right ) -  ex-horthyist pensioners mszp ( center-left ) -  ex-communist pensioners jobbik ( far right ) -  `` concerned '' citizens , also neonazis and `` revise trianon '' types of people all the others -  literally no one, 
   students who are in the same year are organized into 3-5 classes and those classes take all subjects together . 
  no , that is not true . 
  often for the mandatory pe classes the entire grade has the class together , for foreign language classes they often mix different groups together , and you * can * choose one class you want to study more of ( `` fakt '' )  math is one subject , and we go through the different topics depending on what is prescribed for what year . 
  so we do n't have `` algebra '' true for the most part , though i for example go to the math faculty where we have a separate algrebra and geometry classes  there is quite a lot of homework in hungary usually not very enforced though , in my experience . 
  most teachers do n't give a shit whether you do it, 
   i think the situation might worsen a bit between us and hungary . 
  yeah , unfortunately the same will be true between slovakia and hungary . 
  there would still be nato presumably so there would n't be any wars, 
  either [ the suicide song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p50esux_qie&amp;ab_channel=ilonap%c3%a9tern%c3%a9koncz ) or a song of the mulat\u00f3s genre , like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6eegj7isvy&amp;ab_channel=beszota ),
