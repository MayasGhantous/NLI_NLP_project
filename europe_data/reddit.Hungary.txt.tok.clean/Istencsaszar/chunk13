  that 's a pretty brutal contrast to be honest , in hungary there were no pictures of our dictator everywhere , and in the 1980s you could legally go to west once a year . 
  there were some limitations to how much money you could bring with you there , though . 
  the whole system was like a fucking joke for most of us ( who has n't been accused of participating in 1956 or nazism during wwii ) . 
  in the 1980s there were legalized opposition parties even , those parties were the leaders of the things happening 1989-1990 . 
  also , the west germans were let in to meet their east german families . 
  ( i 'm not trying to brag about it or anything , just for the sake of contrast . 
  i think it makes a huge difference if you have a guy with good intent in the seat of state leader . 
  i think k\u00e1d\u00e1r did a lot to make the communism and being the puppet of the soviets better . ), 
  so in romania communism was that bad ? 
  in hungary you could literally say bad stuff about the government and joke about it, 
  i ca n't give exact data , but from my experience , quite a lot . 
  not really , the soviets actually built a lot of industry and housing in the communist states, 
  releasing nation removes cores iirc, 
  i like your username, 
  faith in humanity = restored, 
  well , the uk did approve scotland . 
  and spain almost approved catalonia . 
  sure , if 1. , a democratic enough turkey ( who atleast , you know , treats greek cypriots like human beings ) 2. , the referendum would be approved and 100 % not manipulated 3. , south cyprus approved , then sure . 
  i accept that they wan na join turkey ( i do n't accept leaving the eu though ), 
  yeah , i get it now . 
  :d i just misread your last sentence before but now i get what you wanted to say, 
  why ? 
  the crying about the russia vs ukraine tension is because aggression , not that we just simply dont like the rebels or something . 
  the european value we 're talking about is the peacefulness of something . 
  we oppose aggression and war . 
  we try to arrange the situation so that it creates the least unrest and aggression towards everyone . 
  that accepts wanting to dismantle countries that simply dont work , but not a big country molesting a smaller country because putin says so . 
  ohh , sorry , i misread this part :  pkk has declared that it has nothing to do with marxism like 2 decades ago . 
  i thought it was something like , the pkk has nothing to do with the communists from 2 decades ago . . sorry, 
  why would a kurdish person against the kurds themselves ? 
  i do n't see why this is against any european value, 
  why is it un-european to think that a country , which is an artifical human-made entity should not exist ? 
  communism = / = ussr and friends ' regime . 
  fidesz has two thirds of the votes , man . 
  everything they propose will pass, 
  i like your username, 
  you guys are basically like poland in wwii, 
  pirate parties are not joke parties . 
  that 's about accurate though, 
  polan can into rich, 
  uhh , what you just said makes no sense . 
  i kind of understand that you do n't know but the hungarians were not even near mongolia or central asia ( they were in the southern parts of modern russia and ukraine ) , and there 's no evidence of any contact with them . 
  the debate is about the name . 
  as hungarian native i can assure you that there are no native words for any spirits . 
  none . 
  so the only option was to borrow a name from neighbors . 
  this sounds good . 
  let 's start a kickstarter for a m\u00e1laga-ceuta tunnel, 
  why ? 
  because we did n't have any words for alcoholic drinks ? 
  hungarians were steppe nomads before we settled down in the carpathian basin , so we just did n't have a word for that ( we did n't need it ) . 
  so how could we give it hungarian name to start with ? 
  we did the same with every alcoholic drink ever . . ( beer 's \u00f6r ' from persian/indian , wine ` bor ' from turkish , rum ` rum ' from english etc etc ), 
  til the us is polish, 
  hungarians have a shitton of slavic names . 
  very basic words in hungarian like `` family '' come from slavic langauges . 
  why could n't a name of a drink come from them too ? 
  transylvania ... ( pls romanians do n't hurt me it 's a joke ), 
  linguistic grouping = / = ethnic grouping = / = regional grouping . 
  i say this as someone who is obsessed with linguistics himself . 
  things are not that bad yet , though after the 2018 elections i think you will get medal for it . 
  pls hungary vote agaist jobbik ... pleez, 
  i think he was joking . 
  please tell me he was joking . 
  i wan na believe he was joking, 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mod3lwluqiw ), 
  there 's a cornwall flair doe, 
  gibraltar-morocco sounds doable . 
  but for that i 'd say morocco would have to westernize, 
  turku-aland-stockholm would be nice too, 
  hungarians are typically always complaining about something , so i 'm not surprised at all xd, 
  shitty weather lovers , unite :d, 
  i would n't downvote you , but if you insist ... / s, 
  what about hungarians ? 
  ok , i get it now . 
  thanks , 
  how do you know ? 
  bosnians have a lot of muslims among them , because ottomans ... so that can be a muslim name totally, 
  but what about my hard-earned post karma ? 
  ; _ ; do you want me to lose all of it, 
  not even to them lol , they just use these things to farm votes edit : also , correcting my original comment :p, 
  yeah i think i can say everything i would want to :p ( / s ), 
  croatians do n't have these heretical schr\u00f6dinger 's diacritics either  habsburg 's kissass how dare you insult the glorious emperor, 
  in croatia they do n't draw these little u 's on top of the letter like pul\u0103 . 
  you ca n't fool me , dirty heretic, 
  or maybe i just knew what pula meant ... :p its not rocket science , nor catholic theology, 
  im so proud of myself because i understood that, 
  should n't it be dr. \u00d6sterreich 's ointment ? 
  [ yeah ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/category:hungarian_terms_derived_from_iranian_languages ) , a [ lot actually ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/category:hungarian_terms_derived_from_persian ), 
  exactly . 
  russia would 've continued to occupy crimea even if the referendum didnt happen . 
   angels on horses would make sense if our brothers are [ these guys ] ( http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/civilization/images/9/98/winged_hussar_ ( civ5 \\ ) _ art.jpg / revision/latest/zoom-crop / width/480/height / 480 ? cb = 20130315224650 ), 
  * imperialists  as opposed to hungarians , a nation of literal angels, 
  its just amusing how none of these maps would ever say the obvious ; that oil languages = french dialects and oc languages = occitan dialects . 
  the level of denial of even the existence of that language is literally soviet propaganda tiered . 
  it matters because we can say that romanians were nothing more than aggressive invaders if we were here first ( because they labeled all their conquest as ` reconquest ' ), 
  i know a longer version , but with respect to the `` lets not talk about this rule '' , i 'm just gon na [ link it ] ( http://www.viccesviccek.hu/trianon ), 
  khazars , finno-ugric people and bulgarians, 
   king leslie this is the funniest part,
