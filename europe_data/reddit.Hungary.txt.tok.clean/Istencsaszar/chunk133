  yup . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oz0npco.jpg ) masterpiece was on / r/europe not so long ago for example, 
   that is against the constitution . 
  it 's a shit constitution , then . 
  google translate is garbage though , as expecting it was wrong again, 
  thanks , 
  when someone calls you out for cursing with the words `` how are you speaking ? 
  '' , then it 's pretty common to say `` sz\u00e9pen , magyarul \u00e9s \u00e9rthet\u0151en '' , which means `` in beautiful , well comprehensible hungarian '', 
  well , on one hand , they 're these `` important '' pieces of our culture , the importance of which is blown way out of proportion by mostly the right wing . 
  on the other hand , they really can be good , because they are sung by pervy old men , and that 's funny as shit . 
  but then again those somehow never make it to the cultural festivals , only the crappy censored or cherrypicked ones, 
  [ google ] ( https://www.google.hu/search?q=k%c3%bcrt%c5%91skal%c3%a1cs&amp;rlz=1c1gigm_enhu562hu562&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiy8zp0rqzuahudxrqkhwbhbqqq_auicigb&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=794 ) . 
  it 's really soft pastry which is covered with some sweet ass stuff, 
   not knowing what k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs is, 
  pick is probably the best salami brand in the world , but i do n't think salami is originally hungarian , think it 's italian maybe ? 
  while they 're also solving a rubiks cube, 
  it is that, 
  i mean technically , if you plan to leave all the best bits , then sure, 
   p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt can be eaten with fork no you do n't , wat, 
  yes , i think that the counties of hungary should be at least somewhat autonomous . 
  centralization is insanely detrimental to everything except budapest, 
  the cinque terre are bit of a detour , and when i was there it was ultra crowded . 
  it looks great otherwise , but it 's gon na be crowded , and the train there is gon na be even more crowded . 
  or , if you want to go to the beach then rimini is the usually recommended place , though i 've never been there myself ( been to florence , barcelona , rome and venice tho ), 
  you can easily afford to miss it . 
  seriously . 
  hang out in florence on the way from venice to rome instead, 
  there 's no such thing, 
  wait , there are places where it 's not like that ? 
  heard the song name but the song maybe once or twice . 
  ca n't even recall the tune nevermind the lyrics, 
  single ready to mingle, 
  are you guys making this up spontaneously or is it just some reference i 'm not getting, 
   i only address women by m ` lady . 
  what are you , a bourgeois ? 
  obviously you should be using ` comrade ' . 
   socialism is a somewhat radical ideology , be it democratic or not - i.e. 
  it is n't part of the mainstream . 
  depends on the country . 
  speak for yourself, 
  austria , naturally, 
  tbqh i do n't think they would have much moral qualms against that, 
  what ? 
  obviously he implemented them to discourage people from joining leftist groups . 
  he outlawed leftist parties then literally implemented their very programs, 
  yes they are lol, 
  and skype, 
  \\ #thecommieswerebetter, 
  we do n't even have an equivalent for `` the netherlands '' , so too bad for you, 
  they have a bigger ego , that 's basically it, 
  no , but violent cartoons do play on tv, 
  english and german , mostly . 
  in my school there 's also italian spanish and russian available , also i believe latin too , but then again no one wants to learn that, 
  is it really though ? 
  loli is distributed via the internet , so you have to directly search it to access it . 
  whereas violent cartoons on tv are worse , because you may access them randomly as well, 
  it 's nobody 's business what people do in the privacy of their homes , alone, 
  what is an upperhouse even, 
  so you actually proclaimed that you will actively go against the tide , which makes it a-okay . 
  romania is not in schengen, 
  yeah , true, 
  s\u030ckodas mainly, 
  state is literally a synonym of province . 
  it 's not misleading , everyone understood perfectly well what i meant . 
  budapest spam on / r/hungary is too real, 
  you know , i 'm not retarded, 
  some of them are n't , actually , so i 'm gon na leave it this way . 
  this is typically not a category where you can decide who `` wins '', 
  kek, 
  while i do n't know , maybe the whole `` spreading islamism to the whole world '' thing ? 
  in my highschool it 's not a thing, 
  so like most toys , really, 
  i said that they only care about budapest 's interests , if anything . 
  mostly they do n't though, 
  fuck no . 
  parliament never gave a shit about anything other than budapest 's interests , but right now they do n't even do that, 
  make canadas states join individually too, 
  yup, 
  i think the `` liber\u00e1lisok '' would count as such, 
  i suppose the one that you live closest to, 
  sounds a lot like stalinism to me, 
  is he elected by the people ? 
  in hungary the president is just chosen by the parliament , since it matters too little ... 
   redditor for 1 hour why are these types of accounts allowed to post, 
  yup , as i would 've guessed myself , i 'm from california according to the quiz . 
  closest to san jose and fremont ( and honolulu for some reason ) . 
  but that 's specifically the accent and dialect i am aiming to speak most of the time , so it 's all good, 
   ... hungarian ? 
  really ? 
  romanian is just romance hungarian, 
  latin   esperanto, 
  omelette could also work, 
  i think he would just asexually reproduce . 
  i wonder if that 's allowed in islam or not, 
  we only celebrate the revolutionaries . 
  soldiers are generally the people you fight * against *, 
  that 's also a coast , the coast of the great lakes, 
  5 - jeles ( excellent ) 4 - j\u00f3 ( good ) 3 - k\u00f6zepes ( medium ) 2 - el\u00e9gs\u00e9ges ( enough ) 1 - el\u00e9gtelen ( not enough ) there 's also weird half grades like 4/5 ( four fifths ) , which is between 5 and 4 , and 3/4 ( three forths ) 2/3 ( two thirds ) and 1/2 ( one half ) . 
  same but 5 is the best, 
   hungarian native language  english i basically grew up with it .
