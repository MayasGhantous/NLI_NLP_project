  look , it is really obvious that if the words for wednesday and thursday are * indisputably * slavic , then the one for friday might as well also be . 
  the slavic word in question is * related * to that greek word , distantly . 
  as distantly as the bengali or the english one . 
  but the slavic word does n't come from the greek one , and the hungarian one does n't either . 
  yes , but it is also related to bengali \u09aa\u09be\u0981\u099a ( p\u0101\u1e41c ) and loads upon loads of others . 
  suggesting that it `` has roots '' in the greek word is absurd , about as much sensible as saying it has roots in this bengali word . 
  [ wiktionary says otherwise ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/p%c3%a9ntek ) ... i also find it much less likely to have it borrowed from greek , since the rest are all either slavic or hungarian as well edit : i mean yeah the slavic word is a cognate with greek penta , but it 's also a cognate with latin quinque and english five , so that is n't exactly saying much, 
  h\u00e9tf\u0151 - `` the week 's head '' kedd - from * kett\u0151 * , two szerda - from slavic `` sreda '' , but actually pronounceable cs\u00fct\u00f6rt\u00f6k - from slavic `` c\u030cetrvrtak '' , but actually pronounceable p\u00e9ntek - from slavic `` pe\u0328taka '' szombat - from shabbath vas\u00e1rnap - `` market day '', 
  val d'aran is in catalonia, 
  that 's actually better , since the smaller groups will be less likely to engage in separatism, 
  \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af you could make it so that many regions are multi-national in the first place, 
   in their own state 's interest oh yeah , this is the version where the states still exist . 
  but the same phenomenon exists within countries regardless , for example in poland there 's still a massive divide between the ex-german and ex-russian parts . 
  that 's not something you can avoid anyway . 
   i think people would still behave like the old borders were intact for at least a generation after federalization , in many ways . 
  like in what ways ? 
  well it 's usually really oily/greasy , and about the same size as a pizza . 
  there are multiple toppings , the most common are tejf\u00f6l ( a kind of dairy ) or cheese or both .

  jesus christ you goddamn savages . 
   cause you ca n't use simple olive oil or butter , right ? 
  i put [ tejf\u00f6l ] ( https://bocitejivoszeged.hu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/tejf%c3%b6l375g.jpg ) on it usually . 
  it 's better than the original , hands down, 
  it means black mountain and they have a water polo team, 
  oh yeah , that too . 
  that 's some good shit btw . 
  here we still call it `` n\u00e9gercs\u00f3k '', 
  it 's n\u00e9ger , and it has no negative connotation, 
  dracula . 
  the actual guy from the book was hungarian . 
  the inspiration for dracula was romanian . 
  yet romania gets all the buzz about it, 
  well , if by freely you mean that i would n't have to pay for it , then i would say milan , vienna and barcelona . 
  nope, 
  oh you just started ? 
  hope i didnt scare you off now  . <, 
  hey i do that too . 
  its really cool, 
  too difficult ? 
  that 's really cool , to say the least , 
  italian because i 'm in highschool . 
  in highschool we have english too , but i would n't count that as learning . 
  also fucking around on duolingo , mainly french and italian , but i will eventually level up my spanish and portuguese too, 
   hungarian on duolinguo , so i can talk to my grandfather in his first language . 
   akkadian and sumerian how come ? 
  that 's not what we 're talking about, 
  nope , she is hated by the entire school , teachers and students alike, 
  tfw it 's a teacher of mine, 
  so , i was right ... 
  if i had to guess , it 's some ultra large , unhealthy food with fake cheese on it, 
  he 's a cunt, 
  swimming and waterpolo , most likely ... 
  i do n't have a personal favorite because i do n't watch the olympics, 
  you 're gon na encounter racists everywhere, 
   `` what murderers do you admire ? '' . 
  the answer should be none because they 're murderers . 
  what about winston churchill ? 
  you think i do n't know ? 
   if you do n't think cultural identity plays a major role ( infact the biggest ) in separatist and independent movements then you need to research some history . 
  seriously . 
  no , i do n't . 
  hungary in austria-hungary was not separatist a bit , despite clearly knowing that it was culturally very different . 
   disregarding the diversity between us if anything it 's the nationstates that do that . 
  nationalists constantly babble about diversity when it 's about the eu , but within their countries they constantly prefer cultural homogeneity ...  why do you want a federal european state because the current countries are laughable , without exception . 
  on the world stage they 're specks of dirt compared to the us and china , most even to russia . 
  if the eu does n't get its shit together then we can expect another cold war-esque division of europe plus , nationstates suck ass , they 're mostly very centralized which should end , besides the aforementioned problems with their obsession with uniformizing and killing the native cultures . 
  not really , separatist movements come from perceived oppression and the belief that being separated would be better for the people in general . 
  everyone knows pretty well that separation from the eu would be bad for them economically , so unless they 're complete retards , they wo n't care . 
  if what you wrote were , once again , switzerland would be completely unstable from all the separatist movements, 
  yeah , you 're fucking delusional if you want the congress of vienna ... you know that its entire point was to maintain the feudal order and the otherwise ultra-oppressive empires would help each other in killing the liberals, 
  serbian mini-empire vs democratic institution . 
   being this emotional about it kek . 
  nationalism at its finest, 
   concert of vienna you mean the congress of vienna 1815 ? 
   giving powers to regions concerning other regions or the federal government why ? 
  why the hell ? 
  that sub is unfortunately fairly empty most of the time, 
   today luxembourgish as a `` language '' is at a record number of speakers even with close to 50 % foreign residents in the country this . 
  the languages will remain if there 's enough support from the local governments, 
   yes , languages would disappear over time , unfortunately most likely no , they wo n't . 
  why would they ? 
  ninja edit , also :  history shows us that unions eventually have one culture dominate the other . 
  like switzerland ? 
  yes , asap, 
  he is n't, 
  same, 
  it 's shit , and we have nutella and homemade jams . 
  shops do n't even sell it , not that anyone would buy that crap, 
  it 's a joke dude . 
  i see you 've only been a redditor for a few days so i get that you 're not used to this , but he is clearly joking, 
   many usa states have larger populations than european countries . 
  you are delusional . 
  i 'm from hungary which is a pretty small country in terms of population , only 9 states are larger than it . 
  the us is really fucking empty,
