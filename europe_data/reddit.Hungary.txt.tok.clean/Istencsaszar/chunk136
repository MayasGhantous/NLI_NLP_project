  as long as it does n't extend past the borders of my town : sure . 
  any other case : fucking no . 
  not even referendums . 
  referendums are just expensive opinion polls, 
  well that is the standard that is taught . 
  but many people write differently . 
  many people write the 's ' similarly to the printed variant . 
  some write the russian-style z with a tail . 
  some make the lower part of the f curve too . 
  some cross their j 's . 
  i think most people write the capital letters similarly to their printed variants . 
  edit : also lots and lots of people write `` o\u0304 '' and `` u\u0304 '' instead of '' \u00f6 '' and '' \u00fc '', 
  well besides romania we also have slovakia, 
  also , there is * extra *, 
   spongebob dubbed in sicilian or neapulitan i 'd watch that, 
  why would you say that ? 
  i 'm totally that , yea, 
  i did n't do anything, 
  oh , i get it now . . you want me to switch the pronouns while i 'm saying the thing . 
  let me see : `` i 'm always right , verylateish '', 
   no you 're not , i am !, 
  :d that 's what i 'm saying : you 're not , i am !, 
  well i do concede that i never voted , but i 've been at the voting places and i 've never seen anything similar sooo , probably no, 
   first your finger gets marked so as you do n't get to vote on another place this is actually a really good idea, 
  there you go then : i 'm always right :d, 
  you say it first, 
  true, 
   where they got their data from , though , i do n't know . 
  their asses , most likely, 
   more open mindedness yeah , sure ... anything 's possible with a bit of imagination :p, 
  the map was made with some guy randomly putting colors on a map, 
  that would surely not lead to * any * problems whatsoever . 
  austria , or croatia, 
  haha , nice joke . 
  the communists took their property and they were either gotten rid of or forced to work with the common folk . 
  they were discriminated against as well . 
  i do n't think anyone would even claim to be an aristocrat , and it 's better that way . 
  neither can i lol, 
  in hungary we have something similar . 
  the parents stop receiving benefits for their child if the kid does n't go to school, 
   dinner at 21:00 wtf ... 
  i eat dinner between 6 and 7 usually, 
   and the bosnians build it i thought it was slovaks who built stuff, 
  yup . 
  and it 's not like iasi was that much worse in terms of potential either . . 
  i 'm from a town that 's 200 kms from budapest . 
  i know really well that centralization is cancerous and is to the detriment to everything that is n't in the capital . 
  i know the situation is similar in romania . 
  i suppose you might not have such hands on experience with this , but trust me , it 's better for the countryside to be to develop without foreign interference from the capital . 
  and it 's even worse in countries like france or austria, 
   that 's true . 
  i 'm reluctantly pro eu federalization , as long as individual entities keep internal autonomy at least at the level of us states i 'm really pro-eu federalization , though i would mainly prefer local autonomy being on a * very * local level , like regions or municipalities , mainly to combat nationalism . 
  yeah , those can get kinda cancerous : /, 
  chill dude , it was a joke, 
  sure , the point is that you 'd be romanian even if you were an austro-hungarian citizen or even if romania did n't exist . 
  being romanian = / = having romanian citizenship, 
  oh yes , the good old romanian method on how to improve industry - just take it from someone else ... 
  that 's citizenship , meaningless state papers . 
   total collapse of civilization due to overpopulation why tf would that ever happen ? 
  there could be famine and a lot of worse shit , but why the hell would it take civilization itself ? 
  sounds good to me, 
   we blame hungary for that literally what . 
  the hungarian prime minister explicitly asked franz joseph to not start the fuckin world war, 
  and france, 
  a ** \u00e1 ** b c ** cs ** d ** dz ** ** dzs ** e ** \u00e9 ** f g ** gy ** h i ** \u00ed ** j k l m n ** ny ** o ** \u00f3 \u00f6 \u0151 ** p ( q ) r s ** sz ** t ** ty ** u ** \u00fa \u00fc \u0171 ** v ( w x y ) z ** zs ** we have a few, 
  it might just be me but that description is really confusing . 
  you could just used math symbols like i = y and i\u0301 = y\u0301 but i ! = \u00ed and y ! = y\u0301, 
   \u017e - di in `` cambodia '' better example would a * s * ia or u * s * ual, 
  cyril and methodius are reptile alien illuminazis confirmed, 
  hope you 're happy now that you got * my * approval :p, 
  that 's fine, 
  in tanning beds . 
  solariums . 
  meanwhile there 's an actual beach resort thingy in town , and the balaton is like 1 hour by car ( or 2 hours by train ) where you can get tanned the traditional way , so yeah i 'm gon na keep that opinion, 
  still not sure what you meant, 
  tanning at the beach -  lots of woman do it tanning beds -  trashy af, 
  t\u00far\u00f3rudi , obviously, 
  do n't really have any experiences specifically related to their nationalities . 
  i see the `` russians are annoying and do n't speak english '' meme a lot , but i encountered some russians who did speak english and were pretty cool , so yeah . . 
  we use the same formula as normally with people of identical names : * id . 
  alexandre dumas * and * ifj . 
  why does it bother anyone if you sit in class in silence on your phone ? 
  it 's much better than the stuff we do when we do n't have our phones . 
  more difficult to carry with zero benefits over phones , in fact it 's inferior because you ca n't make calls, 
  yeah , not everyone uses their phones to play there you know . 
  in foreign language classes we use the dictionaries on our phones , in math or physics class we often use the phone to look up formulas . 
  etc. . 
  countries dont have beauty standards, 
  we often say * isten bassza meg * ( may god fuck that ) or * isten fasz\u00e1ba * ( into gods dick [ with that ] ) . 
  i also often say * j\u00e9zus ereje * ( strength of jesus ) , not sure how common that one is across the country though, 
  someone who goes to school right now, 
   ban children 's use of mobile phones at school welp , there goes my respect for him, 
  no the greek word comes from sanskrit , check wiktionary, 
   1g quality weed sounds good, 
  did n't deny anyone anything , what did you smoke mate , the fence was built to make sure people did n't try to enter illegally ( ie . 
  to stop the dicks that simply walked through the border in the middle of nowhere ), 
  husz\u00e1r is a word with unclear etymology . 
  some say it 's from the hungarian word h\u00fasz, 
  yeah , but they are n't isolated , they know that they fit into the european or global picture , they 're deciding right now how they want to do it, 
  individuals have a personality , countries do n't .
