  i think the biggest reason why le pen wo n't be voted into office will that french people do n't want to be seen as the country that just followed the us and uk in going crazy . 
  i think/hope that france chooses europe over the anglos, 
  should n't either . 
  referendums are basically expensive opinion polls, 
  `` y tf tho '' seriously , who the hell spends their free time in church , so weird in the end i would apply the good old principle of `` in a free society everyone is free to fuck up their lives the way they want '', 
  and the serbian word is from latin , which is from greek , which is from sanskrit . 
  definitely against it . 
  our cunt of a prime minister would make us part of the slower tier , which would suck, 
  coach , and related words in other languages come from hungarian * kocsi * * rubik * 's cube * goulash * and * paprika * , naturally * hussar * from * husz\u00e1r * possibly the word * saber * / * sabre * , comes from hungarian * szablya * the phrase * itsy-bitsy * comes from hungarian * ici-pici * the word * chav * comes from gypsy , via hungarian * cs\u00e1v\u00f3 * romanian has a huge amount of hungarian loanwords , a few off the top of my head are * ora\u015f * < - * v\u00e1ros * ( city ) , * \u015foim * < - * s\u00f3lyom * ( hawk ) , * chip * < - * k\u00e9p * ( image , face ) , * uria\u015f * < - * \u00f3ri\u00e1s * ( giant ) . 
   of course it seems overrated to you , a native . 
  this . 
  i remember seeing a group of japanese tourists photographing the local church , like wtf guys it 's the most normal church in the goddamn world but apparently it was interesting to them ... 
  i was hesitating between state atheism and secularism , though in the end i chose secularism , i would still restrict religious activities and keep a really close eye on the churches . 
  also i closed the tab and left `` nonconstitutional '' accidentally , obviously i would choose constitutional, 
  nope , pretty sure nobody even does , or very few people at best, 
  interesting , wikipedia usually writes `` 1000-1944 '' for the kingdom of hungary , since that 's when it went down de facto, 
  did n't sz\u00e1lasi change that , proclaiming himself nemzetvezet\u0151 and all that ? 
   why would some bureaucrats from brussels who 've never even been to my country decide my future ? 
  idk about you but i 've never met my country 's leaders either . 
  there should be shame in politics in general, 
  agreed . 
  independence is overrated as shit, 
  edgy, 
  i thought it was destroyed in 1944 , not 1946 . . 
  geography class taught me differently, 
  yeah because people could go there , and it was communist, 
  austria , naturally, 
  because international events are usually organized by corrupt fucks with strong agendas , plus the countries themselves are shady, 
  it 's great actually . 
  too budapest-centered which is bullshit , but otherwise it 's fine, 
   i 'll go first you could like , get a flair so we know which country you mean, 
  we once colonized the kingdom of naples . . i think that 's just a fact people memorize so we can say that there was a time when we were like , relevant ... do n't think most people from there even know, 
  well we in hungary also have a history of forcibly assimilating minorities , and that did n't end well at all ... 
  interestingly btw , hungary 's turks have voted `` no '' over 70 %, 
  well depends . 
  `` maga '' is more of a friendly , everyday formal , but also the one you would use to insult . 
  '' \u00d6n '' is a more `` official letter from the tax agency '' type of formal , while `` tetszikez\u00e9s '' is the one you would use with your mother-in-law ... 
  i think it 's fine as is . 
  do n't know or care about assimilation , but they are pretty well integrated, 
   from 1850 and onward . 
  it basically went to shit , and did n't get better until 1920 the literal exact opposite, 
  i actually like that type , though without meat it 's not worth much so i rarely do eat it, 
  honestly i 'm glad if the train arrives within \u00b1 5 mins of the scheduled time, 
  everyone has to learn it in my high school without exceptions , but for some people it 's the second language after german , for most it 's the first language . 
  the latter group also has to learn another language as well , so in the end everyone knows english and another language ( on paper ), 
  these are of course * totally * udmurt words, 
  there 's other liquor ? 
  m\u00e9m in hungarian . 
  / me : m /, 
  it 's a joke , though tbh it 's not like it could be used for anything either, 
  it 's not , btw . 
  people use insta and facebook, 
  i 'd leave the country if there was mandatory service . 
   hungary was n't oppressed under austria-hungary , it was a union you know perfectly well that i was n't talking about austria hungary . 
  1541 through 1867 ... 
  though the 1867-1914 period is also a great example , hungary was prospering incredibly despite not being independent . 
   the issue with the hungarian part of the empire was that although non-hungarians were 50 % of the empire 's population , they only held 10 % of the seats in the parliament . 
  the voting system was unfair to hungarians as well as minorities , most hungarians also could n't vote , it was very much a privilege of the bourgeoisie regardless of nationality  we were under actual oppression for a 1000 years . 
  before nationalism existed there was hardly oppression , especially not one based on nationality , since the very concept did n't exist . 
  it 's simply not comparable to the 19th century and onwards  are you not allowed to use the hungarian language in official communication in areas where there is a sizable hungarian minority ? 
  actually , yes . 
  at least that what my friend who lives in said areas told me . 
  apparently a policeman/fireman / is required to speak in slovak even in areas with significant hungarian majorities, 
  i did n't say that it did . 
  you just brought up a completely unrelated subject as to what we were talking about , i regret even replying . 
  so like the hungarian language in slovakia right now , yeah . 
  yeah , i would take that opportunity myself without a doubt . 
  cool story btw, 
  the whole `` you 'd be speaking x language '' argument is so stupid regardless . 
  if they mean you 'd be speaking it as first language , that 'd be bullshit , if they mean as second language , then what the hell 's wrong with that . . like , seriously , is having to learn other languages so horrific to these people ? 
  oh i see , how 'd you get there ? 
  that 's what i expected . 
  because the exceptions . 
  if you make the nations solely cultural then you wo n't have a single exception , plus you 're giving people an option to choose themselves . 
  if the national cultural institute is n't area-bound , then it can take care of everyone that belongs to said nation without bothering anyone of the other nations , and without anyone being left out . 
  there 's the cs\u00e1ng\u00f3 dialect/language which i ca n't understand, 
  that 's not what the definition says whatsoever, 
  which is like , most of the time . . ca n't even name a language where this does n't happen right away, 
  ok but then why would you want nation states when you at the same time agree that local level should overrule it ? 
  really all they 're doing is being pesky middlemen between the local level and the eu , in addition to being an easy way to do populism , centralization , alienation and cultural imperialism . 
  what 's the point of keeping them when the local level does just as much a good job of preserving cultures , in fact a better job actually, 
  no it 's not, 
  yeah , why ? 
  what the problem with that is that nothing really works on a national level . 
  sure poland would be a rare case where it does but , for example , how does one integrate to belgium ? 
  if i learn french and become french on the flemish part , does that make me `` integrated '' into belgian culture ? 
  or vice versa ? 
  how about the case of multicultural cities ? 
  if i move to cluj , romania , do i need to adopt romanian culture , even though a significant portion of the population is hungarian ? 
  what about a more extreme example of odorheiu , romania where 90 % + of the population is hungarian ? 
  what about catalonia ? 
  if i speak perfect castellano but refuse to speak catalan , do i qualify as an integrated resident of barcelona ? 
   a weird `` science '' fetish oh gosh that is so weird . 
  they are interested in science as long as they do n't actually think with their brains, 
   malay so um , how and why ? 
  same but scratch romanian and add german, 
  yeah um , this guy called orb\u00e1n , you might have heard of him, 
   in diversitate concordia * in varietate concordia also yeah , i do n't think having member nation-states is even a good idea . 
  the nations should be what they are : cultural institutions and thereby communities of people . 
  which can be political entities , sure , but assigning territory to them would be hugely problematic , plus , you 'd have to mess with the current borders if you want to make it look remotely fair , which will be controversial ...
