  yeah , naturally . 
  i mean come on , hungary was n't independent for like half a millenium and the identity remained perfectly well , and that was under empires that specifically wanted it to go away ... 
  it 's because languages are a political term , not linguistic, 
   how bizarre it is to have both cases and articles excuse me ? 
  the orb\u00e1nistan meme is huge . 
  its common to refer to him as the `` vikt\u00e1tor '' , his hometown felcs\u00fat is a massive meme as well . 
  also the classic from b\u00f6d\u0151cs tibor where he calls him `` bonsai caesar '' and many others . 
  learned about the plc and after that they were just bundled with the other two baltic states and mostly we only talked about the three as a whole, 
  religious diversity would be another, 
  i do n't think that 's the only thing similar with germany and hungary tbh . 
  yeah same here , in the end what he does is nothing , because he does n't use any of the powers thankfully , nor does he interfere with anything, 
  oh , i see , we do n't often make a distinction between soviet and russian, 
  that 's such a dick move to send free shit you did n't want then make you feel guilty for not paying, 
  interesting , in hungary russian/soviet stuff is usually regarded as `` crappy , shit-looking , but extremely durable '' ... like seriously , my grandma still uses soviet christmas lighting from the early 1970s , and there 's not a single bulb that failed . 
  like holy fucking shit , how do you even, 
   it 's insulting to be lumped together with each othe sorry i guess , but then again you 're gon na have to expect it  to represent us fancy word for doing nothing , so they do n't matter either ? 
  no powers , right ? 
  stay . 
   it 's the most important thing to ever happen in europe . 
  what about the enlightenment ? 
  careful with that edge, 
   do n't give a flying fuck what they call themselves in their language also , there 's nothing positive about calling people by their native names . 
  i for one actually prefer `` hungarian '' over `` magyar '' any day of the week , heck i would find the latter more offensive in a foreign language context, 
  not every gypsy speaks romani , and most gypsies ( the ones i talked to anyway ) actually prefer the equivalent of gypsy rather than roma, 
  a president ? 
  til presidents actually do stuff in czechoslovakia, 
  yeah , it 's pretty much a necessity for people who were on the wrong side of history and been cut off from the rest of the nation . 
  wow i 'm sure lots of people will volunteer to learn serbian and walk around rural serbia and talk to some gypsies just to inform them that they actually have a day, 
  holy mother of christ , insane, 
   nationalism [ . . ] holds that a nation should govern itself , free from unwanted outside interference , and is linked to the concept of self-determination . 
  i would say a strong no, 
  not necessarily , they just like the eu maybe , they might have dual citizenship and nationality , etc. 
  fuck no, 
  do n't really see the point to making exact definitions . 
  in that case sure, 
  as long as you do everything with a healthy amount of cynicism , sure . 
  yeah , true, 
  we got fucked just as much , if not more, 
  probably they are n't either , they probably have communities of immigrants or something, 
  i would argue that it 's worse , because in other places like africa they do n't even try to pretend they 're connected by more than being colonized by the same guys , while here we have this weird culture of nationalism lingering which is honestly , stupid, 
  well mainly in the west they do follow ethnic lines , but in general i would n't say they do that much, 
  by goodly sized you mean minimal . 
  absolutely nothing more than a few villages, 
   5 black people we have in slovenia black people are n't `` diversity '' ... 
  you have a choice between `` shit '' and `` crap '' , or if you 're that type of person , you can even vote for the `` assholes '' or the `` cunts '' . 
  glorious , is n't it ? 
  he meant like for variables and unknowns, 
   losing world wars we lost two world wars too, 
   citiziens who talk shit about their own country definitely not the best at that lol, 
   kings would still be coronated in krak\u00f3w in hungary we also had this , kings would be coronated in sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r no matter where the capital was, 
  not ia\u015fi ? 
  seconded, 
  well physically speaking , portuguese people :p culturally i would say probably france or something , though most cultures in europe are very much foreign . 
  all the non-basque cultures in europe are, 
  yes it is, 
  well that said most towns have at least a bit of uniqueness in linguistic variation . 
  because i like to talk to people ? 
  well , not sure if this belongs here but in among my friends we use * maf * , which is sort is short for * m * i * a * * f * asz ( what the dick/what the fuck ) . 
  this also has the advantage of sounding nice , unlike the more anglicized variant * wtf * ( v-t-f ), 
  damn , you guys are missing out . 
  that 's like the main use of kurva here , to use it as an adjective , or even as an adverb, 
  really ? 
  you guys cant omit the copula ? 
  yes , its a sentence in hungarian, 
  yeah , it is a sentence , and since it contains one international word and one slavic word , it might also mean the same in some slavic language, 
  yeah sure but those are slavic languages , that 's not hard to do . 
  most of them are basically the same ( no offense slavic people btw , just my experience ), 
  i could imagine a phrase like '' * kurva politika * '' ( fucking politics ) to be the same in some slavic language . 
  otherwise , probably none exist, 
  that 's good . 
  schools are pretty much the most important tool for preserving a language, 
  they could get some honorary titles , like some cities have honorary citizens for certain , they could get some medal or something, 
  do you guys have schools that teach kids the language ? 
   castilian was n't that aragonian ? 
  i do n't think sardinia was part of castille, 
  what would a typical house name be ? 
  it was limited to a small area to begin with , i believe the town is called algu\u00e8r or something close to that ? 
  will look it up once im on the computer, 
  that is really cool  make sure to preserve your language and culture , its important, 
  which tribe/language ? 
  yeah , i guessed so . 
  its really cool that this came from latin aprilis, 
   prill this sounds really cool tbh, 
  it is ? 
   word stress estonian is like the absolute heretic among finno-ugric languages . 
  word stress ?? 
  too much indoeuropean4me m8, 
  though contrary to what the name suggests , it more like a / r/easterneurope _ irl, 
  their days are counted, 
   normally the head of state is a very dignified figure who always behaves up to standard i thought the head of state was basically a joke position , but suit yourself . 
  they do n't . 
  you 're thinking of the catalan community in sardinia, 
   he named his house in breton so , totally gon na gloss over the fact that you guys name your houses ? 
  sure , it had a massive impact on hungarian culture regardless . 
  and yeah , that 's literally what official language means . 
  we usually voice the / s / between vowels into / z / . 
  so , caesar / tse : za : r / for example . 
  we also often have / \u0283 / ( sh ) in place of s , especially at the ends of words like * praxis * / praksi\u0283 / or the suffix - it\u00e1s / - ita : \u0283 / , obviously from latin - itas , equivalent to english - ity . 
  same , except we pronounce `` ae '' the same as the long `` e '' , which is hungarian ' \u00e9 ' , while `` oe '' is a long ' \u0151 ' usually . 
  / g / in hungarian as well,
