  um , yes and no . 
  nobody learns spoken language first . 
  the nature of learning languages is that you 're exposed to more written material than spoken . 
  so for us , it 's the pronunciation situation that is ridiculous . 
  interestingly because of that , often non-native speakers of the language can spell easier ( example , for a learner its very easy to tell whether it 's `` your '' or `` you 're '' ) . . 
  but they will struggle a lot with pronunciation, 
   ethnic connection with hungary dat euphemism tho, 
   further back : no you do n't feel connected to the roman empire ? 
  its language was the official language of hungary for 800 years . . 
  yeah . 
  we should really start a european reddit :p, 
  i feel you mate, 
  native english speakers are n't that numerous here, 
  no , i think that nation states are a particularly shitty way to organize ourselves . 
  i really do n't care about what ethnic groups inhabit my country , as long as they integrate an can be talked with . 
  also , back when the country was founded , nationality as a concept did n't exist , as such i find it hard to reason along the lines of `` ethnic group that founded the country '' ... 
  especially so because it 's extra likely that back then hungarians did n't look much like europeans , rather more turkic . 
  this should be a real thing . 
  quick wiki research tells me that the area was inhabited since 5000bc , then celtic tribes settled there , then it was a part of the roman empire ( pannonia province ) , later germanic and illyrian tribes settled , then hungarians , and the city under its current name was first mentioned in 1009 . 
  i already speak italian so neither would be especially hard for me . . but catalan seems nicer to me, 
  doubt their motives ? 
  damn , you reminded me how much i love barcelona . 
  should move there someday , i love the language ( catalan , i do n't like spanish tbh ), 
  if it were possible to secede and stay within the eu , would you go for it ? 
  we have this same system , we call them simply `` nationalities '' however , they have the right to form their minority councils and a country-wide national council as well . 
  we have 13 nationalities , which are : bulgarians , gypsies , greeks , croatians , poles , germans , armenians , romanians , rusyns , serbs , slovaks , slovenes and ukrainians . 
  there are also the bunyevci who are applying for nationality status but were rejected , their status is complicated because some bunyevci are already in the croatian minority councils while some are n't ... 
  they were considered croatians in yugoslavia and so some of them also do here . 
  we also have jews who specifically asked not to become an officially recognized minority, 
  austria , naturally . 
   whilst in english it 's not not true . 
  [ oxford dictionaries ] ( https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/holland ) , [ wiktionary ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/holland#english ) and [ merriam webster ] ( https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/holland ) all list `` the netherlands '' among the definitions of `` holland '' . 
  actually , there are quite a few people who still learn german as the first second language . 
  not sure why , but they do . 
  regardless , everyone learns english in high school, 
  not really . 
  the only actually common names that are n't spelt in a standard way are german names , but literally everyone can pronounce the german names so it 's not a problem . 
  we even have some german words that are written like that , because the ` ch ' sound can only appear in those . 
  ( echte or pech for example ), 
  well east germany is very much eastern europe in a sense , and i believe the op meant it this way, 
  i would n't vote for either of those, 
  you can see some of them in / r/europe, 
  well i guess most people would understand it as `` ethnicity '' , but i do n't like to use that word for the ( eastern european ) concept of nationality , since it has some seriously genetic connotations in english , which the term nationality does n't . 
  the thing is , in eastern europe we usually see the nation as the ethnicity , the group of people who are all hungarians for example , and the country was made by them , that 's why it 's hungary . 
  while for example ( to me it seems that ) french people see that there was the country first , and they are french because they happen to live there and because they have the citizenship . 
  in the west people seem to view their citizenship as their nationality , and the east seems to prefer ethnicity ( but as i said it 's not genetic , you can become hungarian with hard work , at least your kids definitely can ) . . and this brings a different mentality . 
  most eastern european countries have at least one major historic minority that does not consider itself part of that nation . 
  and i think most of us are fine with it . 
  i see no problem with the fact that some people just are n't hungarians . 
  they simply are n't , they are not part of this nation and do n't want to be . 
  we respect their rights equally , they have the same rights , but we do n't think of them as hungarians , and they do n't think of themselves as such . 
  well if you apply the logic properly then the `` fake news '' - screaming idiots are also to be ignored, 
  - what communism was like for reals - what having your country occupied is like - what dictatorships are like to live in - what means of information exist besides the media - that nationality and citizenship are not the same , and you should n't treat them the same , ever these latter two are the most important ones . 
  the very last is more a balkan-y thing , but i think most eastern europeans did n't lose the otherwise important distinction , unlike most of western europe . 
  and yeah , when you 've lived in a dictatorship you know for a fact that you never believe what the tv says , what the newspapers say , what they tell you in school . 
  just do n't . 
  you 're best off if you stay out of politics altogether , but if you want to inform yourself , do it via trusted sources , such as your neighbor , your friends from the uni or high school , your customers/the shopkeeper , or your family . 
  in other words : from places that do n't have any interest in fooling you . 
  same thing with hungary 's communist dictator k\u00e1d\u00e1r, 
   eye contact that would be pretty creepy tbh . 
  you 'd see very well in the drivers eyes that he wants you to just fucking get off the bus already, 
  no no it 's actually really interesting, 
  once, 
  interestingly , this is also hungary 's statistic , if you mean losses, 
   invasions were always going towards , not from russia lol get fucked , my country was invaded 4 times by russia in the last 200 years, 
  ultranationalist oppressed serbs are not exactly the same animal as modern italians, 
   you have to travel abroad for summer vacation tfw you have a good lake :p, 
  left, 
   arpadovi\u0107 that 's a cute way to talk about the house of \u00c1rp\u00e1d, 
  still do n't understand how you ca n't * love * it , it 's amazing . 
  i personally hate it when you do n't use the article , it just sounds overly formal to me . 
  in any casual setting you need that * a *, 
  then for your own sake , never listen to conversations about politics . 
  yup . 
  what savage refers to people without a definite article ? 
   in sicilian , the gesture for `` no '' is raising your head sharply ( the opposite of nodding ) i believe it 's the same in bulgaria as well ... that might just be an urban legend tho, 
  yeah , these are because they come from different latin verbs . 
  in latin the most common was * eo * / * ire * ( to go ) , which is where `` ir '' comes from . 
  but there was also * vado * / * vadere * which meant ` to walk ' and supplies many forms such as italian/french/spanish `` va '' and others , including english in * vade * . 
  also * alare * , whence french * aller * , and and a disputed other verb for the * andare * forms, 
  italians form negative imperatives with the infinitive , which i find amusing . 
  so for example * andare * ( to go ) , of which the normal imperative is * va ( i ) * ( go ! ) . 
  but if you want to say `` do n't go '' , you have to say * non andare * ( not to go , or maybe `` no going '' ) . 
  hungarian used to as well , it 's the reason we have 2 different ways to express `` 2 '', 
  what about mortacci ? 
  is n't that similar ? 
  well yeah , kinda racist but really often the case . 
  and it barely seems to be improving : /, 
   the natives see the us a 90 % white country turned to 65 % in just 40 years well it 's kinda their fault for how they define white ( apparently anyone with even a hint of black blood is black , weird af ), 
  b\u00e9la ii the blind k\u00e1lm\u00e1n the book-lover, 
   they have a bad influence on the main govt . 
  party not that those guys would 've ever been nearly good in the first place, 
  if you are in the country and you have a minimal bit of intelligence , you can learn any language in a matter of months ( would say weeks , but let 's be realistic ) . 
  it 's not rocket science at all , just make sure you speak as little in english as possible . 
  that combined with a basic knowledge of grammar from a good grammar book can get you very far . 
  especially kossuth though , he is viewed as the most important one , which is kind of a shame ... 
  bene\u0161 is kinda viewed as a massive asshole in hungary btw , mostly for his smug nationalist arrogance against hungary . 
  `` i wan na live til your wedding '' was what my grandpa used to say, 
  i do n't think most people have an opinion on any of them . 
  definitely not,
