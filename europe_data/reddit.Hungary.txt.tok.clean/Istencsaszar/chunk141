  we 've always had something like ' `` x '' used to be `` y '' , and so certain forms resemble y more than x ' . 
  in german i just never had that , always memorize more and more irregularities without explanation . 
  three words . 
  jesus fucking christ i 'm glad i stopped learning german ( no offense ) ... 
  well , there are obviously those ultra-nationalists who want everything back . 
  theyre crazy . 
  there are the people who want at least some revision , especially on the slovakia border because there is a large hungarian minority there . 
  and it kinda depends as well . 
  i think if , say , burgenland voted to rejoin hungary , people would just go with it , why not ? 
  but i dont think anyone other than the most hardcore of jobbik fans would want to force it . 
  and yeah , trianon is still kind of a big deal , given that because if it , one in six hungarians live outside the borders .

  [ trianon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grand_trianon ), 
  i 've been there , seen it . 
  uhm , so pretty much all of what is historical hungary and then some . 
  for example the battle of n\u00e1ndorfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r is pretty important in hungarian history , even though now the place is called belgrade , serbia . 
  also you know , that fucking castle in france, 
  that 's pretty much the same with any place . 
  if it 's part of a smaller country then it 's gon na get disproportionately more money, 
  you mean that country with the czech-speaking hungarians ? 
  the first one was made in 1949 ( they tried it in 1919 as well , but that republic did n't last long enough to get one ) . 
  the newest one is i believe from 2011 ? 
  eh , no opinion . 
  he also hates his compatriots maybe ? 
  especially based on race, 
  if you speak hungarian , you are hungarian . 
  you do n't , you are n't . 
  i 'm not victimizing anyone . 
  i 'm denouncing you for ideological fanatism . 
   how am i being ideologically fanatical ? 
  you literally just said something is wrong because some ideology is against it . 
  so instead of reasons , you just [ appealed to the ideology ] ( https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/appeal-to-authority ) to make an argument . 
  well , yeah, 
  i always felt like the sz\u00f3zat actually sounded more anthem-y than the actual anthem, 
   everyone 's a pacifist when they 're drunk . 
  i have to disagree . 
  some of the most violent people are drunk people . 
  what you mean to say is , everyone is a pacifist if he gets to drink, 
  same , but we had to learn all verses . 
  but only the first one is sung , the rest is just a really fucking depressing poem, 
  same in hungary . 
  i know the hungarian version though . 
  it is okay , but it does n't even compare to the mighty g\u00f6tterfunken, 
  who cares . 
  dont fall to ideological fanatism, 
  social progress is way easier when you already have the internationalism . 
  it comes first , socialism later, 
  best : horn gyula worst : sz\u00e1lasi ferenc , but if we have to go with elected , then g\u00f6mb\u00f6s gyula i guess ? 
  well you could make a contest with hungary too : ferenc sz\u00e1lasi ended the 1000 year old hungarian monarchy , donated the holy crown of hungary to hitler , he executed everyone who did n't get into the army , needless to say he sent all the jews to auschwitz . 
  he was arguably more zealous for a nazi than hitler . 
  he sent almost all of hungary 's resources to hitler , including agricultural products , machinery etc. 
   the eu liberal construction the eu is primarily an internationalist institution though , thankfully, 
  no , they 're not, 
  well , to my ears , they both sound a bit creepy . 
  i really dont like nationalism at all , mainly because of stuff like this . 
  nope . 
  having one bad leader in the country at the time is bad enough, 
  well , i warned you about the creepiness and the jingoism :  beautiful kolozsv\u00e1r ( cluj ) , the proud city of m\u00e1ty\u00e1s ( matthias corvinus )  ca n't be , no , never , the ornament of the vlachs  the banat shall not bring bread to the serbs  hungarian winds should blow over the carpathians  when the time comes - the graves open up  when the time comes - hungarians rise up  when the time comes - our arms will be strong  just wait , brothers , we 'll be there , and wo n't give anything up  with noble anger we 'll run forward  we 'll paint a cross of blood onto the border-stones  and we 'll sweep away everything , it will be the victory  we 'll fight even gates of hell  we 'll fight screaming , like a massive wave  we 'll fight to a drop of blood , and the hungarian borders will stand  in its entirety , like not so long ago  and our star will be on the sky again  our flag flies , our sword shines  the evil ones run away from us - we 're hungarians  our angry hymn is heard everywhere ,  we want our homeland back - or we die for it  our home wo n't be smaller , not with an inch  she will shine like she used to  through the plains and mountains of hungary a scream is heard :  we 'll never let go of \u00c1rp\u00e1d 's homeland . 
  yeah . 
  it was written in 1922 , but it 's still no excuse for it . 
  it 's a quote from attila j\u00f3zsef , from his trianon poem he wrote in his teenage years . 
  quite a popular quote among jobbik supporters and other people in that ideological area . 
  ironically the author later became a communist . 
  i can translate the whole thing for you if you want , its an incredibly creepy jingoistic poem .

  -  old people, 
   ancient, 
  that wasnt turkey , it was the ottoman empire . 
  at least get your facts straight, 
  for-profit education is a big no-no . 
  only nonprofit organizations and governmental bodies should be able to run schools, 
  thank you for making this comment . 
  without it , i wouldve had to reply to him and get dragged into a long pointless debate, 
   basque cultural influence pretty much ends north of bayonne . 
  today , yes . 
  the ancient aquitani , who were the ancestors of basques , reached to bordeaux and further, 
  transdanubia , more specifically somogy , in southern transdanubia . 
  somogy itself has a great cultural heritage , as it was the region where the people were least willing to convert to christianity back in those days . 
  well , depends . 
  the irregular verbs are gon na be hard af . 
   romance languages in general can be very difficult to pick up for germanic native language speakers . 
  i would argue they 're not ( at least they should n't be ) - they are two related language groups that had lots of contact with each other , for millennia . 
  their grammars are extremely similar , as well as the vocabulary ( romance vocab is a piece of cake if you know english ) source : personal experience learning italian, 
   cevapcici i like how they did n't even bother to translate the thing into hungarian , just slapped the original word there . 
  it 's csevapcsicsa goddammit, 
  very important,
