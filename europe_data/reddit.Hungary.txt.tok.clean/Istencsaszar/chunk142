   reddit has a problem with it because the echo chamber makes the stupidest anglo-saxon stereotypes about ~ ~ france ~ ~ every non-anglo country resonate here . 
  ftfy, 
  aw , that sucks : /, 
  why is your falg the comoros flag tho ? 
   the rust belt is not orange , though !, 
  that 's a light pink . 
  it looks orange to me , however in hungarian i 'd definitely call that `` diarrhea colored '' . 
  not sure if it 's understood in english tho, 
  usually in the process of learning it you will start liking it though , no matter what language, 
  milan , because it 's warmer than here and i speak italian so i would fit somewhat . 
  yeah , although windows is set to hungarian , everything else is in english, 
  you 're not pulling that shit, 
  looks like a * v\u00e9res hurka * to me, 
  and interestingly * s\u00fclt * in hungary is a different food ( or group of foods ), 
  idaho would actually be part of french louisiana, 
  [ quick thing , mainly about stereotypes rather than actual thoughts , but whatever ] ( http://i.imgur.com/a0rrm1b.png ), 
   ` chav ' was originally a romani gypsy word for ` young boy ' yeeah , that 's actually very well known . 
  we also have `` cs\u00e1v\u00f3 '' ( ~ chavo ) in hungarian . 
  but there 's also a gypsy word for girls here , which is `` csaj '' ( ~ chay ~ choy ) and that 's way cooler . 
  the thing about hungarian is that most of our words are of unknown origin , so we ca n't really share any particularly cool ones , because they are simply not known . 
  however of those that are known , most likely the [ iranian ones ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/category:hungarian_terms_derived_from_iranian_languages ) are the most exotic . 
  `` race politics '' is the most laughable thing about america . 
  it 's gotten to the point where you actually have nationalist groups on either side . 
  i do n't think you understand what native means . 
  native means that people grew up speaking it , not learning it from grammar books . 
  those people are n't native speakers . 
   living language for it to be a living language it would have to have native speakers , which it does n't . 
  it is exactly as living as latin is, 
  yeah i like his songs too . 
  had a blast listening to them in italy with italian friends, 
  saw it before , he also has a newer single , [ tutto molto interessante ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmzjfnk0llk&amp;ab_channel=fabiorovazzi ), 
  this one is great, 
  the intro reminds me of [ keny\u00e9r ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riyuyq-uvi0&amp;ab_channel=bal%c3%a1zsol%c3%a1h ), 
  say hello to constant wars in that case, 
  well , you are right if you mean the second definition . 
  other than that , no, 
  not any more than esperanto . 
   so what , if the intention in this case is for a common european language ? 
  it 's a common ie language , not european . 
   a common standard common standards are great for official languages , but in real life , people will ignore them and speak differently . 
   do you suggest a different apolitical made up language ? 
  fine , solves the same purpose no , i 'm against made up languages in principle . 
  i will stick to the language that actually did hold together multinational countries before , including my own : and that is latin . 
  and the reason for that is that it 's a natural language , so it was actually spoken at some point . 
  which guarantees that it 's actually a working whole , unlike esperanto . 
  which might work on paper , but nobody ever spoke it as a native , as such it did n't go through the baby steps of language change to become a well-speakable natural language . 
  wow , another language you ca n't understand the written form of without studying . 
  sure this definitely is different than all those other languages you also ca n't understand . 
  but this one is also easy to learn , so we will be able to have any next door retard learn it and then hold government offices !!!, 
  awesome , is n't it ? 
  i would rather have latin , so we can make it a requirement to learn it for certain offices and thereby make it harder for idiots to get in, 
   its apolitical it 's way too indoeuropean to be neutral , so no . 
  it 's also very clear that esperanto was n't made by a linguist , as such it is incredibly unrealistic , in the sense that from day 1 , the language would change considerably when spoken . 
  we can easily assume that it would be cluttered with loanwords from everyone 's native languages , most likely fucking up its supposed regularity , but most likely the grammar as well . 
  this would be awesome , yes , but it 's not gon na be viewed well by the national governments at all . 
  so we need to also reduce their power and influence in this matter, 
   downvotes i 'm like 99 % sure it 's some butthurt americans with auto-downvote buttons, 
   to my country to be honest , everything bad has already happened . 
  i do n't think the future can bring much worse  europe nationalism . 
  it has always been the enemy of civilized behavior , which i think europe should be based on  civilization mainly nationalism , but also the dumbass idiots who run countries in certain places, 
  annam\u00e1ria is n't that uncommon though among the younger generation, 
  no lettering or seals does n't apply if it 's on a coat of arms . 
  plenty of flags have lettering on it that way and it 's fine, 
  we also have the holy crown on the coat of arms, 
  that sounds pretty dumb though , why would you be using a flag that literally stands historically for only one of your regions ? 
  i get that it 's the main one , but still . 
  crusades : medieval right-wing populism, 
  nope, 
  i 'm not even gon na attempt to translate, 
  it 's even cooler when it 's in some combined form like `` vattene a fanculo '' or `` andate a fanculo '' . 
  at least to me that is . 
   kako da ne !, 
  - how yes no !, 
  = yeah right !, 
  in hungarian we have `` nemigen '' ( not yes ) , which means `` not really '' or `` not very much '', 
  you know your country sucks when the last major victory you can reference in an internet argument is 700 + years old . 
  it 's mainly just vona though who does this because he wants to beat orb\u00e1n next election and wants to expand his party . 
  the core , the foundation of the party is still on neonazism , which is why the aforementioned jewish guy left when he found out he was jewish, 
   i 'm sorry most of you were raised to believe otherwise and to hate us . 
  dae one ca n't possibly disagree with me unless you were brainwashed to do so ? 
  dae my opinions are universal and people who disagree are just stupid ? 
   i 'm sorry that your politicians continue to poke every one of your neighbours and create tensions who the fuck cares about politicians . 
  should i mention b\u0103sescu and his cancerous comments too ? 
   why ? 
  just because i say that ? 
  please . 
  it 's a fact , not a nationalistic opinion . 
  again , an equivalent statement in hungary would be jobbik-worthy . 
  you judge yourself how you want , from my perspective , you 're an ultranationalist . 
  maybe it 's the society you were born in that makes these statements okay . 
  whatever . 
  i 'm just amused by the irony that * you * call * me * brainwashed, 
   what 's my shitty nationalist agenda ? 
  you are defending annexing an area with about 53 % romanians , you are supporting humiliating the losers with yearly celebration and being offended when they do n't want to . 
  you claim that doing a similar event on the other side would be `` fascist dick weaving '' . 
  yet when it 's about your nation , the exact same `` fascist dick weaving '' is a-ok . 
  in hungary , the people who get emotional about transylvania are the jobbik supporters and the people even farther right . 
  you are doing exactly that . 
  and your only counterargument ? 
  `` but muuuh naaatiiooon ... muh nation needs the lebensraum .
