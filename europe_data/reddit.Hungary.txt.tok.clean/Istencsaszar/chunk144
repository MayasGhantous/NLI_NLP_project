  with that many titles it takes serious skill to suck, 
  you mean eg\u00e9 ** szs ** \u00e9gedre ? 
  it 's just a long ` sh ' sound . 
  it 's written that way because it comes from eg\u00e9sz + - s\u00e9g also often it 's just `` egs '' or `` eks '' , which sounds like `` eksh '', 
  yeah but its nice to set up the long term goals . 
  obviously even the simple federation is long shot at this moment . 
  its a great step though , agreed, 
  i think you meant to comment somewhere else, 
  yeah but obviously i do n't want to speak those languages ... duh, 
   ` united states of europe ' the only problem with this is the states . 
  which would continue to spew nationalist bullshit at the local level all the time . 
  i think the nation-based entities would make it unstable and unreliable . 
  as such we should also get rid of those, 
  goddammit so many consonants, 
  first off , chill . 
  stop losing your shit about this type of stuff . 
  the internet 's gon na be the internet , every place on it ever is gon na be subjected to raids . 
  you ca n't do anything about it . 
  / r/europe is doing an incredible job if you consider how well known it is, 
  `` delightful '' also sounds great, 
  actually it 's a pretty average name here . 
  outsiders probably find it badass though, 
  attila probably, 
  troll subs like sas , omg you 're salty, 
   \u2206 physicist spotted, 
   we own a house in western hungary this is becoming a stereotype so fast . 
  not that i mind , it 's just funny . 
  which county do you own a house in ? 
  if you elect me , i will make / r/askeurope great again . 
  when america sends their redditors , they 're not sending us their best . 
  they 're sending us the racists . 
  they 're sending trolls . 
  they 're sending sexists . 
  and some , i assume , good people, 
  who cares, 
  yeah , between ` k ` entum and satem languages right ? 
  like , even the least educated american could tell the difference between bulgarian and romanian ( satem and centum respectively ) , but no one could ever do so between italian and french ( two languages so closely related that if they were spoken in africa they 'd be considered the same , both centum ) you realize that linguistic relatedness is n't the same as audible difference to a layman , right ? 
  do all indo-european languages sound the same to you as well ? 
  sounds like finnish , yes . 
  like hungarian , no, 
  yes, 
  there is no fucking way they sound similar, 
  still though . 
  a valuable year lost, 
  because it 's better to not have as much power for an individual , unless there 's a huge war or something so someone has to make quick decisions . 
  other than that ( which we hope wo n't happen ) it basically has no downsides compared to the presidential thing, 
  well that was an experience to read, 
  i get the no census on race , why do you not do a census on nationality ? 
  you ca n't just apply it for chavs only . 
  there will be many bright people who would be forced to spend their most productive years in the military . 
  absolutely not worth it, 
  flights between two ends of the country could be useful though , especially for routes that are n't covered by good roads , like debrecen - p\u00e9cs . 
  or just build the goddamn southern motorway, 
  mkkp ? 
   * new * countries  hungary that 's a weird way to spell `` 1000 year old '', 
  being european is not a matter of skin color, 
  yeah no . 
  that is bullshit . 
  probably loads of people have european citizenship without even having set foot in europe ever, 
  thanks  i 'm a huge geography nerd though . 
  still `` pays de la loire '' caught me off guard . 
  i tried everything about the loire possible except that . 
  my try on the [ countries ] ( https://i.imgur.com/xmvcxpe.png ) , [ us states ] ( https://i.imgur.com/rysvhoc.png ) , and [ france ] ( https://i.imgur.com/b3uka3u.png ), 
  we only had to know the location and capital of every country in the world . 
  we did go through most in more detail though , not all however . 
  i usually say isis ( pronouned like ` aisis ' / ' \u00e1jszisz ' ) , however there are people who pronounce it `` eezis '' / '' \u00edzisz '' . 
  also , especially in the news it 's very common to refer to them as `` iszl\u00e1m \u00e1llam '' ( islamic state ), 
  nope , this is an actual alt righter, 
   it 's why a new charlie hebdo will not appear . 
  charlie hebdo is still fucking going you idiot, 
  strong movement towards a european federation, 
   vote xd i 'd vote for that, 
  it is n't , no one cares . 
  the only negative effect is that orbans approval ratings went up, 
   geography now i used to watch it but it has gone down the shitter at this point . 
  all those country = human metaphors make me cringe , also describing populations by skin color seems to be his hobby, 
  * egy tucat * means 12 , pretty much just a fun synonym at this point . 
  there 's also * egy m\u00e1zsa * ( 100kg ) for weight measurements . 
  we also used to have * egy ak\u00f3 * ( 54,3 liters ) to measure alcoholic beverages , but it kinda died out now unfortunately, 
  username relevant, 
  yeah , not that hard to imagine, 
   our national day is `` shit '' oh , did i hit a sensitive point ? 
  do n't worry , every state event is shit and will forever be . 
  no matter which state , no matter what occasion . 
   we 'd like to leave in a peaceful union . 
  guess what , not wanting to go to certain events ! = having anything against romanians in general, 
   do you realize your politicians are using those people for votes ? 
  yeah , everybody knows that  they are spreading anti romanian propaganda . 
  whatever . 
  nationalists gon na nationalist  our government shits on them ? 
  well i mean they do want autonomy . 
  it 's the normal thing to do . 
  no not really . 
   not attending what is this , communism ? 
  are people being forced to go to bullshit state celebration shitshows now ? 
  fuck me , that sounds horrible . 
  i sure as hell would n't attend . 
   european union values it 's a european value now to attend shit like that ? 
   europe would still be waging wars on each other because some people prefer not to go to * state sponsored events * . 
  what the fuck,
