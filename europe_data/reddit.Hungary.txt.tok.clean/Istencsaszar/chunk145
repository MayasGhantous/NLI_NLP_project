  well to start off , wiktionary is wrong here on the [ \u027e\u0259 ] and [ \u027e\u028a ] , these are not always flapped in an unstressed position , they can also be [ t\u0259 ] and [ t\u028a ] depending on the preceding sound ( s ) . 
  otherwise , yeah , you 're right . 
  it does change depending on stress, 
  that 's not a differentiation based on whether it 's stressed , it 's based on the following sound ( as for ` to ' and ` the ' ) . 
  actual stress based ones are ` for ' , ` as ' , ` at ' , ` from ' , ` of ' , ` can ' , ` am ' , ` are ' , ` do ' , ` and ' , ` a ' etc. 
  why is it that the italian ones are all italian while the hungarian one is bilingual ? 
  here it 's `` look up formulas in the formula book '' all the time . 
  that 's it . 
  if you have a teacher , then memorize formulas and recall, 
  as for hungary , it 's [ gyakorikerdesek.hu ] ( http://www.gyakorikerdesek.hu/ ) . 
  it 's cancer, 
  looks like every nationalist separatist group in history to me, 
  this . 
  so much this . 
  also , even less fucks about x poet 's shitty life and/or love stories . 
  why is that even taught as a subject, 
  yeah . 
  the steppe . 
  you know , it was mostly tatar-populated to around 1600-ish , right ? 
  ( exact date source is my ass , i 'm just guessing here . 
  i know exactly that in 1400 there were no russians there , and that in 1800 there were basically no tatars left in that area , soo ), 
  no , if you want to place historical uralic settlement then draw a line from kazan to riga and basically everything north of that used to be uralic-populated . 
  i think his poem * nem tudhatom * ( i ca n't know ) should be known europe - , if not worldwide . 
  they were in the entirety of the steppes before russians or ukrainians . 
  if you drew a line from kazan to crimea , basically , everything to the south used to be tatar-populated ( different tribes obviously , not all but you get the idea ), 
  the thing is , most people associated them with russia and therefore russians . 
  it is a tough thing , but that 's how it goes in the world of nationstates like russia . 
   could we say nations are made up of related tribes ? 
  not really . 
  what tribes are americans made up of , for example ? 
  even if you consider the certain immigrant groups , they definitely are n't related . 
   rise of [ . . ] right-wing fuck no . 
   welfare shopping ikr ? 
  fuck austrians who come over for cheap shopping, 
  basically the same as a tribe  `` right to self-determination of nations '' ? 
  it 's an okay thing , but it should never ever be applied on a territorial basis . 
  nations are n't entitled to areas, 
   forgot cyprus cyprus is asia ... :p, 
  i think that counts the kurds too , cause they also have turkish citizenship, 
  well , you ca n't really know that . 
  we know that the basques were there around the roman age , well so do we know that the ancestors of hungarians were there , just on the other side of europe . 
  the goddamn immigrants again . 
  i did some research though , so 9,5 m turks live in eastern thrace so unless theres more than 3m migrants then hungarian still wins . 
  and we also didnt count the hungarian migrants in western europe, 
  its not rocket to science to figure out tho , looking at `` jag kan f\u00f6rst\u00e5 de fuktiga mejmejs p\u00e5 sweddit '' . 
  see , no need to learn the language, 
  no , hungarian . 
  turkish is only spoken by about 10 million people in europe , hungarian by about 12,5 million, 
  same, 
  probably, 
  yeah . 
  intercity trains have free wifi in hungary . 
  good luck :d, 
  trying hard to become nordic , i see, 
  finno-ugric tribes have been living on both sides of the urals , and it is n't known which side hungarians were on , so you might as consider that part of europe, 
  this . 
   implying that you speak any more than that, 
   to say they can speak some phrases in a pre-indo-european language of course though , they never seem to choose the largest non-ie language of europe , that they almost seem to forget that it exists, 
  churches should gtfo . 
  they shouldnt be allowed to run anything, 
  i have a whole grammar book downloaded in pdf , the thing is that it 's in occitan , not english . 
  so it 's a bot of a challenge to learn from it ... 
  not that close though . 
  occitan , it 's my favorite language of all time . 
  too bad there 's next to no learning material for it : /, 
  wow :d if you need help or anything , feel free to pm me or post to / r/hungarian, 
  that family made hungary go down the shitter big time, 
  yeah , but they are a minuscule amount of the minorities in france, 
  last time we hijacked the financial system of the dual monarchy so that disproportionately more money went to us :p but even if it 's even , we 're better off that way . 
  austria has lots of money sitting around that could be used well to help hungary develop, 
  no , i mean the fact that they were literally made fun of in school . 
  they were punished for speaking their language , they were shamed for it . 
  generally in french schools people who dared speak a word of the `` patois '' had to wear clogs around their necks as punishment . 
  it would work if it 's the same monarchy as austria :p otherwise no , shit idea, 
  spain could veto their accession, 
  the only disadvantage for their secession is that they 'd automatically get out of the eu which they do n't want . 
  hungary has the same thing . 
  i still ca n't understand how those millions of people did n't care that their native culture was looked down on and oppressed, 
  sure , same thing , but the - iszt\u00e1n thing is edgier :p, 
  hey , mary is hungary 's patron saint too . 
  back when hungary was a kingdom , it 's motto was '' * regnum mariae , patrona hungariae * '', 
  no , malta has maltese and ireland has irish, 
  this, 
  and more importantly , make english an official language . 
  which would actually make it serve a purpose . 
  actually , that is n't even a bad idea in the long run . 
  first off , country attacked , lol . 
  never gon na happen . 
  if it did , i would leave the country asap so probably couldnt care less . 
  though i probably would oppose it , unless it 's a crucial thing to defend like , against isis or something ( because forcing young people to die is bad , but actual genocide is even worse ), 
  no , the correct translation would 've been czechoslovakia . 
  did you not read the comment you replied to ? 
   `` tschechei '' was used for ** czechoslovakia ** , seeing how its a mixture of `` tschechien '' and `` slovakei '', 
  so , in short , you believed google translate . 
  because if you look closely , the person you replied to said it meant czechoslovakia and not czechia . 
  the best answer to this is `` who the hell cares ? '' . 
  seriously , use whichever you want, 
   believing google translate username relevant, 
  not with turkey either . 
  probably the best way to expand would be to encourage people to make their countries more democratic ( either through revolution or democratic reform ) , and let them join that way .
