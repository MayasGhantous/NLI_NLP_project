  hahahaha , ca n't even think what that must feels like . 
   even though it 's pretty clear cut : those who betrayed their own nation payed that with their lives . 
  yay , ultra-nationalistic terrorism, 
  no that 's hungary, 
  it 's well known outside the balkans too, 
   so sad . 
  no , man . 
  its great . 
  we 're considered exotic by everyone . 
  it 's really nice, 
  none, 
   especially in rural places people grow some tomatoes , cucumbers , grapes etc. 
  and have fruit trees . 
  well i mean , obviously . 
  you need to grow something to make alcohol out of :p, 
  you are n't really legit complaining about how i am , when you provided literally nothing to support your side, 
  it 's a bit weird , i agree, 
  why , educate me . 
  what other main differences were there ? 
  so the same story as every one except one of hungary 's sugar factories . 
  if they were profitable they would still exist . 
  i usually just tag people nationalists , could n't care less which nation they 're from, 
  yeah , i know , i also have him tagged as a nationalist, 
  so , basically , it was privatised and unsurprisingly it went down the shitter because it was unprofitable ? 
  also , how did we get to a sugar factory from heavy industry . 
  you know what heavy industry is , right ? 
   tovarna sladkorja ormo\u017e nothing to be found in english about it, 
  source, 
   ( thanx to you and your eu ) totally not china, 
  [ except they did ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/1318819/germany-in-secret-talks-with-russia-to-take-back-konigsberg.html ) want to do it ( takes like 2 seconds to google ) . 
  also oppressed russian minorities , made the easiest way possible, 
  same . 
  i always keep a bit of distance from officers with guns, 
  i shot a few at a shooting range , also had my grandfathers gun in my hand that he used to hunt with, 
  we have these in hungary too , so i 'm pretty sure hungarians in romania also do these, 
  we have all the same ones , except the dreik\u00f6nigstag . 
  we instead have * v\u00edzkereszt * ( water cross ) , which is i think called epiphany in english ? 
  i have no idea what we do on that day , it 's traditionally the day you get rid of your christmas tree, 
  literally every country has a regime, 
  it 's horrible , do n't believe google . 
  it misses the meaning completely . 
  most of the funny parts is completely lost . 
  edit : and yes , we can shop on sundays now, 
  [ basz\u00f3dj\u00e1l meg kdnp ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8n63k0vzsnk&amp;ab_channel=apazenel ) ( get fucked , kdnp ) is a song that was made when the fidesz government banned sunday shopping , because of pressure from its coalition partner , kdnp ( * kereszt\u00e9nydemokrata n\u00e9pp\u00e1rt * , christian people 's party ) . 
  the song is pretty harsh on them , insulting the party members by their names too , with lyrics like :  * basz\u00f3dj\u00e1l meg kdnp s k\u00fcl\u00f6n semj\u00e9n zsolt * ( get fucked , kdnp , especially you , semj\u00e9n zsolt )  * nemzet\u00fcnknek segg\u00e9n ott piroslasz mint a folt * ( you 're a red stain on the nation 's ass )  * nem v\u00e1lasztott senki \u00e9s nem k\u00e9rte hogy besz\u00f3lj * ( nobody voted for you and asked your opinion )  * z\u00e1rod \u00e1m te vas\u00e1rnap a pof\u00e1dat be j\u00f3l * ( you should close your fucking mouth on sundays instead ) the rest is awesome too , if someone wants i can translate the whole thing but too lazy to unless someone asks me, 
  do n't forget the pervy poems that are said before the watering, 
  yeah , not sure about that . 
  for example hungarian does n't have the french r ( we have the u ) , but i 've never seen anyone struggle with trying to pronounce it, 
  theres barely any interaction between kazakhstan and hungary, 
  i know , i just dont wan na ruin it with the / s, 
  it 's because the italians are totes copying us, 
  if turkey counts as asian , then that . 
  if not , then probably israel because the jews who migrated there from hungary, 
   you ca n't have a society without trust . 
  yes you can lol global society is already based on that , distrust among nations ; and even if it was a prerequisite , how the hell does that relate to what i just said ? 
  are you saying that everyone is your supervisor who you should be forever devoted to and trust ? 
  lol fuck no , what type of question is that even . 
  you shouldnt trust any authority ever, 
  did n't they mean to sell it back at one point ? 
  portugal . 
  they hide very well behind spain, 
   say r and u correctly maybe i 'm just coming from the right cultural background here , but i do n't think either of those are difficult to do, 
  yeah , well not that much but then again orban is clearly the lesser evil . 
  he 's more comparable to jobbik , so i would choose orb\u00e1n , although if these were the two choices i 'd most likely just not vote, 
  dont know who vadim is, 
  that would be horrible actually . 
  the government would call me a traitor in no time , but i 'd vote for literally anyone other than orb\u00e1n . 
  probably matteo renzi, 
  yes it was . 
  i see this attitude pretty often on reddit . 
  people think eastern europeans are racist, 
  why is this downvoted though, 
  what was going on in eastern europe was nothing more than state capitalism . 
  same as capitalism , but the only company is the state . 
   i also think , with more regional power , people would be more interested in local politics and maybe raise their voice . 
  yes . 
  many decisions can be made well on a very local municipality or city level . 
   how the federal decisions are going to be made ? 
  by the federal government , of course . 
  yes . 
  barely anyone is in reddit from southern transdanubia, 
  idk . 
  some are simply too nationalistic . 
  some just think that it would be a centralized country , which obviously wouldnt work . 
  in reality a federation would give more powers to local authorities and less to the nation levels , at least thats what i think would happen, 
  i dont think you understand what a federation is . 
  brussels wouldnt decide either of those things, 
  because what is hungary is about 5/6 of hungarians , the rest is scattered around mostly in slovakia and romania . 
  and knowing todays politics , the only way you can get all those guys under the same flag as well , is by making a european federal state . 
  imho that is the best option for the rest of europe as well, 
  oh , i get it now , but i do n't think people will recognize it that you meant it this way . 
  / r/hungarianpolitics _ irl, 
   a hungarian proverb : one of my eyes is crying , you mean `` one of my eye is crying , the other 's smiling '', 
  hungary definitely is n't . 
  hungarians ' best chance at having a country that unites the nation is a federal eu ( because lets be honest , we 're not invading nato countries ), 
  transdanubia is a region of hungary fam :p, 
  that 's more like * megdon\u00e1lc * tho , is n't it ? 
  like the shitty pun on it ; * megdum\u00e1lsz *, 
  the general population is the most pro-europe in europe actually . 
  fidesz is just populists with zero values , they will only do the minimal thing necessary for them to stay in power,
