   social democrats  socialism marx is rolling in his grave . 
  my hungarian source says there was no east slavic involved . 
  it got into hungarian from tatar ` b\u00fcs\u00fcrman ', 
  also one you do n't usually pay attention to : * r\u00e1c * ( serbian ) - * keve * ( which is old hungarian for stone , cf. 
  we have a town called `` venice '' , which * happens to be * next to a lake called lake venice ( velence and velencei-t\u00f3 in hungarian ), 
  there 's also hajd\u00fab\u00f6sz\u00f6rm\u00e9ny , wherein ` b\u00f6sz\u00f6rm\u00e9ny ' is an old term meaning ` muslim ' . 
   they have no real policy outside of imitating western leftist rethoric except not really . 
  the western left is a million times dumber because of the whole `` never experienced communism '' thing . 
   life is not shitty here in any way imo kek  they ca n't even decide if they want refugees or not pretty sure they 're pro-taking refugees  but they sure like them better than ethnic hungarian minorities from our former territories literally who cares . 
  they are a party in hungary , not romania and slovakia . 
  if they get to power in hungary , they are responsible for the citizens of this state . 
  not `` everyone of the nationality that the state is supposed to represent but really does n't '' . 
  yeah pretty much, 
   other than your own why the hell would i say my own, 
   some obscure dialect tbf though , these `` obscure dialects '' of chinese were spoken by tens of millions of people each before the whole cultural genocide of the dialects thing began, 
  i think besides budapest there 's only szeged which is mainly opposed to the government, 
  registry office would be the way to go . 
  obviously i would rather spend that 20k on literally anything else, 
  same . 
  its really just for tax avoidance , which is like the only reason i 'd even consider it, 
   then you would have 26 government propaganda `` news '' programs i think the very point is to have it run by the eu , aka . 
  independent of the governments  population of budapest is 8 times the population of the second largest city whatever . 
  budapest is still less than 1/5th of the population, 
  nov\u00e1k j\u00e1nos would be pretty common here too , though kov\u00e1cs j\u00e1nos ( * john smith * ) is the ultra-stereotypical common name, 
  who cares ? 
  it 's not like you can have channels that are n't dick measurements . 
  look at every hungarian channel , basically all could be called `` budapest broadcasting '' and it would perfectly describe their content . 
  not like i care though , at least i get to learn names of places in budapest i will most likely never visit . 
  politicians are not excused to not be able to speak english . 
  here too actually, 
  exactly my point . 
  yeah , though if you take all hungarian-populated areas then i think that makes it more culturally diverse than the us . 
  yes , they are called `` panel '' here, 
  mother/father is sz\u00fcl\u0151 ( literally , parent ) , for aunts and uncles you can just say rokonok ( relatives ) . 
  i was trying to do banter but failed miserably . 
  i always thought that finno-ugric languages were mostly free of references to gender , so it kinda came as a surprise that in estonian you must refer to gender in here . 
  its weird, 
  p\u00e1linka from any random old dude in any village . 
   not being gender-neutral is this even finno-ugric, 
  sounds cool . 
  the eu would be clearly ahead of you when combined though, 
  yeah , that actually would . 
  bernie sanders does go against classical liberalism, 
   peaceful protesters do n't get shot https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kent_state_shootings totally . 
  except they absolutely do . 
  the government does n't even need to be oppressive for it . 
  just a less calm-minded police officer , or police chief, 
  idk , i usually call it left when they are somewhat inspired by marx , and/or they acknowledge him as an important ideological leader . 
  and marx 's ideology is pretty much * the * criticism of classical liberalism . 
  peaceful protests are great for getting shot , otherwise they are worth shit . 
  you need to be violent with powerful people because if you do n't , they will think that the regular folk will tolerate anything . 
   american left is this a joke . 
  you guys do n't have a left , just a centrist and a far right party, 
  a more appropriate name would be ` canine islands ', 
  that 's really it though . 
  it 's not that we do n't where basque came from - we do , it did n't come from anywhere , it was spoken there for as long as we can tell from historical evidence . 
  the real interesting part is where all the other languages came from, 
  hungarian stands out among finno-ugric languages too . 
  there are no articles in the other , nor different definite vs. indefinite conjugations , or separate word forms for i -  you . 
  not to mention the incredibly different vocabulary ( the largest group of words in hungarian are the unknown origin ones , not the finno-ugric ones ), 
   truly democratic decision  electoral college overruled majority vote pick one, 
   i do n't consider russia part of europe actually the definition of what europe is is n't really a matter of personal opinion, 
  i would, 
  oh how the tables have turned, 
  same, 
  as they say , the lawyer is the person who protects you from the law, 
  that makes no sense , why is it so important that 18 + people do n't buy alcohol for people under 18 ? 
  is n't the whole point of being 18 is that you 're considered mature , aka . 
  you are mature enough to know how much you can give to a minor ? 
  you could make the mathematical argument that it 's not inside the food though, 
   romany ( gypsy ) can be regularly heard in the street wait really ? 
  in hungary only rural gypsies speak that , in obscure villages, 
   no major dialects . 
  do n't the dutch constantly brag about how nobody can understand their local dialect in a radius of x ? 
  no , jobbik is shitty enough already, 
  ok now this is getting dark, 
  wait , are you saying that not all scots are stingy ? 
  i do n't believe you, 
  same . 
  step 2 do n't be poor, 
  username does n't check out . 
  do n't they prefer dicks over cunts over there ? 
  yeah , ofcourse . 
  though the scenario seems highly unlikely . 
  not even trump is retarded enough to start bothering the average people . 
  got ta send b\u00f6zsi n\u00e9ni , no one will be able to find her . 
  [ look at this poor boy trying to ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igcmyeonizk&amp;ab_channel=mil%c3%a1nfarkas ), 
  person : hungarian language : hungarian adjective : hungarian please do n't use * magyar * because you 're just gon na mispronounce it and confuse people . 
  just use the exonym that 's what it 's for, 
   cs : go  russia flair checks out, 
   or maybe because it 's easier to order the names alphabetically ? 
  exactly my point . 
  i thought it was a relic from the ceausescu era , no ? 
  was n't it eastern order-only in the ceausescu era or do i remember wrong ? 
   we have old trains ( 40 + years old ) that are a living hell obviously you 've never traveled with [ this ] ( https://www.google.hu/search?q=kis+piros+vonat&amp;rlz=1c1gigm_enhu562hu562&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=745&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi-gqly3i_qahxcvxqkhsb2ba8q_auibigb ) beauty, 
  same in hungary . 
  think the reason is that it simply makes way more sense . 
   even if it 's not grammatically correct . 
  pronunciation is n't even grammar, 
  also , i believe that it 's only pronounced when it comes from latin / f / , such as in * hijo * ( from lat .
