  filius ) , but not when it 's from latin / h / , is that right ? 
  what she probably meant to say is that * prepositions * are usually expressed with the 25 noun cases of our language . 
  in addition to that , there are other ways you can make words longer , so often the actual words are 2 or 3 times longer than the base word they 're made from, 
  in hungarian there 's there phrase `` nem nagy vaszizdasz '' ( not a big `` was ist das ? 
  '' ) , which means something like `` not a big deal '' , or `` not hard to do '' . 
  it can be also used as `` nem nagy kunszt '' ( from the german word kunst ), 
  also the v\u00f6lgyh\u00edd ... the view is amazing from there, 
  this is n't what edginess is, 
  on the internet its kind of necessary to be somewhat of a jerk . 
  nobodys gon na notice your comments if you only say nice things, 
   i 'm not make a direct comparison the eu flag with the america flag but you did just that . 
  you asked why the eu flag does n't work like the america flag : it just does n't . 
  because you are assuming that it has to do with the amount of member states . 
  what do you think the eu is , an america or what ? 
   then learning poems by heart became less important in secondary school . 
  can you please tell that to my literature teacher, 
  italian , hungarian , occitan , scottish gaelic and latin, 
  communists songs are amazing btw .

   inf fact a-h did n't really work well even during its heyday that 's not very true . 
  this misconception comes from interwar british and french propaganda pieces . 
  refer to [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/3q56w7/was_austriahungary_in_decline_preww1/cwca55y/ ) comment by an expert on the topic, 
  perspectives ... there are people to whom isis are just freedom fighters too ... 
  in the offchance that you are serious : you realize that he was a terrorist , right ? 
  you are just gon na validate terrorism for everyone else that way too, 
  native : hungarian , english too basically good : italian , german understand but ca n't speak : french , spanish , other romance languages and latin, 
   i like that you had to go into conjugation for such simple question . 
  well it definitely does matter if it 's your `` fiad '' or `` fi\u00fad '', 
  very true . 
  yeah , dialectal variation is cool  unfortunately we do n't have much of that in hungary . 
  exactly what i expected ... hungarian also has all these sounds , it 's just that we do n't have words that violate vowel harmony, 
  i know , but holy shit it sounds so bad to my ears ... `` t\u00fcdruk '', 
   t\u00fcdruk how dare you have words that violate vowel harmony ... you are n't real finno-ugric, 
  for girlfriend most people say * bar\u00e1tn\u0151 * ( more diplomatic ) or * csaj * ( more slang-y ) . 
  sometimes you can also say * n\u0151 * ( woman ) , to make it appear more mature and/or classy for boyfriend there are many words , the standard one is * bar\u00e1t * ( same as ` friend ' ) , you can also use * fi\u00fa * ( boy ) , if you conjugate it ` regularly ' ( with the irregular conjugation it means ` son ' ) . 
  some other , less common ones are * pasi * , * sr\u00e1c * and probably some i forgot, 
  probably the best place to acquire illegal shit so i 'm definitely gon na go there at some point, 
   too far backwards  from the uk dont worry about that you will be fine, 
  because only france and the uk have the ability to do that ? 
   it would be used to re-start forms of colonialism . 
  `` forms of colonialism '' still exist , that would n't be new, 
   what would it be used for ? 
  defense ? 
  protecting eu interests ? 
  absolutely yes . 
  i personally prefer having a useful army over a useless one, 
  i tried to show it to friends so now at least they now know it exists , it 's not that they use it though, 
  there 's a hungarian facebook page called `` szoci nyugd\u00edjas '' ( socialist pensioner ) which does memes about what these communist elderly people ( mostly women ) say . 
  yup , pretty accurate . 
  that said though i still would n't take the longer route if the bike lane ( the shorter route ) was filled with bikers, 
  wow you guys your president is incredibly influential compared to ours, 
  depends on the person . 
  there are still people who look at it as a sort of taboo, 
  i do this in my hometown too , nothing wrong with it, 
  yeah i did see things similar to the wiki link picture , but they are nowhere near being common . 
  think i saw them once or twice , never in shops, 
  thank you for the sane words, 
  * nationalists, 
  many people will say europa written out in latin though , anyway the point is that it 's not written the same but pronounced identically, 
  those damn indo-europeans ... 
  language : hungarian moon : europa ( sometimes eur\u00f3p\u00e9 ) continent : eur\u00f3pa ofc , they are pronounced identically, 
  its ok , nobody ever expects that from western europeans and anglos, 
   foreigners  talking about this country wat, 
  its ok i guess . 
  let 's get belarus in here as well, 
  thanks for the answer !, 
   it 's fascinating how dialects were/are labeled inferior and forced out of use . 
  cultural imperialism is strong in such places like italy and france, 
  corruption, 
  obviously none , thank god communism at least got rid of that bullshit . 
  those castles were way more useful as hospitals, 
  did you grow up speaking sassarese or italian at home ? 
  nah , this was asking about languages other than your native one , if it was my native language i wouldnt have said it, 
  english and italian, 
  languages and dialects are n't different things, 
  which dialect do you speak ? 
  how common is it to speak it in general ? 
  tfw no circlejerk sub, 
   true patriotism is n't about pompous exclamations or about how many flags you have got or how many times a day you sing a national anthem but it 's rather `` a small everyday work '' on being a decent person , doing whatever is your job properly and responsibly , and overall trying making a place where you live better for everyone what a bunch of bullshit . 
  are nationalists becoming this desperate ? 
  they are trying to label basic human decency as forms of patriotism ? 
  is there an / r/shitbritssay yet ? 
   i guess having hot water and a nice showe was difficult wtf did you smoke ? 
  nope , these are all real, 
  yeah . 
  you know the whole 1989 thing was about becoming part of the west . 
  why would we be sorry ? 
  these names are epic . 
  10/10 would name again,

  budapest is a two and a half hour drive from here, 
   how do you think they are , in regard to how we are ? 
  they 're more relaxed , more ready to have fun if you get what i mean . 
   you 'll be unable to ~ ~ told ~ ~ tell ftfy :p, 
   where were you in italy ? 
  rome , venice , florence , verona . 
  also lived with italians because of a twinned city cultural exchange thing, 
  having been there multiple times , i just like their lifestyle , the language , the people in general,
