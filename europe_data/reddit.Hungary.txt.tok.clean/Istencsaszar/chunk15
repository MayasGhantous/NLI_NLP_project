  i did n't downvote any of your posts ... 
  what i meant was that maybe in his native language he calls them that and that 's why he wrote it like that, 
  we call them ` bolg\u00e1rok ' over here , i suppose other places too, 
  weirdly enough , it is not even sour, 
  in the summer theres a langos vendor on literally every corner near the balaton, 
  said from the country that vetoed the ukraine trade deal because x percent of their population - aka . 
  a minuscule population of the eu disagreed, 
  that 's one interesting poem . 
  it does say `` magyar orzag '' ( note the fact that it 's two words - maybe at this point it was a normal adjectival construction ? 
  ) , but it also say `` magar nepeknek '' in the plural . 
  weird . 
  also note that in a similar construction there is `` nemeth orzag '' , which was also not a well defined area . 
  no , i do n't think it was an official name before that , and that it could n't be referring to the carpathian basin , but instead like its etymology could refer to something like ` magyarlakta ter\u00fcletek ' does today . 
  what i 'm trying to say is that it [ the word magyarorsz\u00e1g ] did n't have any de jure definition , as such the nationalists could apply it to whatever they wanted , and what they wanted to , and they assigned it to the same thing as hungaria , which was a very official latin term , and it 's been used to refer to the country waaay earlier in official texts and such . 
  and after that they claimed that since 1000 this ` magyarorsz\u00e1g ' was a nationstate ( fyi , i 'm not saying that it wasnt hungarians who lived there or anything , just that it wasnt a nationstate , it was just a feudal state like any other ), 
  yeah okay , you 're right . 
  but magyarorsz\u00e1g as a name was only applied to ` hungaria ' officially in 1867, 
  they make it in these mini-restaurants mainly near the balaton , i do n't think they 're made of shitty ingredients here at all . 
  it 's mainly the same as your picture , but we usually put ` tejf\u00f6l ' on it too ( i guess it 's kinda like yoghurt , but has a very different taste ), 
  it 's a [ l\u00e1ngos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/l%c3%a1ngos ) , a hungarian food, 
  um , maybe when writing in hungarian . 
  but hungarian was not common to use in writing , and wasnt an official language . 
  the country was called ` regnum hungariae ' , named after the latin name for the carpathian basin region ` hungaria ' , itself named after hungarians , aka . 
  magyarorsz\u00e1g is an analogy of that , but to me it seems that it only became popular during the nationalism period, 
  just saw your edit , here 's my answer to it : not much would change in reality . 
  every minority in hungary at the moment has the right to create their own so called `` nemzetis\u00e9gi \u00f6nkorm\u00e1nyzat '' ( national self-governance ? 
  ) , and they can decide in their own matters . 
  they have the right to get education in their own language without even having to learn hungarian in the process . 
  i 'd go as far as to say that they would n't notice much of a change edit : wtf downvotes, 
  h is [ not a fricative phonetically ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voiceless_glottal_fricative ) , infact it can be argued that it 's not even a consonant . 
  the thing is , if someone tries to produce [ x ] , they obviously move their tongue to the velum , to make a velar sound , but if they ca n't make the fricative there because they 're not used to doing that with their tongue - well then they go for a plosive , and boom , [ k ] . 
   and why we and some others use your name - magyar/madarsko in sk to de-legitimize hungary 's claims on the historical lands of ` hungaria ' . 
  if you do n't call the people and the country after the historical territory anymore , it 's easy to claim that the land was never rightfully theirs ( for the record , i personally do n't think any nation has inherent rightful lands ), 
  it 's velar , like a ` k ' , that 's enough reason to mishear it as that instead of a ` h ' , which is not velar , nor a fricative, 
  yeah , and i guess czech was n't really used in writing , latin or german was preferred , so the nationalist movement just declared that the words `` czech lands '' * obviously * meant the same as bohemia . 
  i think this is the case because this exactly what happened with ` hungaria ' and ` magyarorsz\u00e1g ', 
   romania  countries older than 200 years pick one ^ ^ pls ^ ^ lets ^ ^ not ^ ^ start ^ ^ a ^ ^ flamewar ^ ^ tho, 
  are you sure ? 
  i 'd still love to see when the word was first attested , because you know , i highly doubt that it existed since time immemorial :p, 
  the romanian government , which is trying to register sz\u00e9kely cultural stuff ( k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs for example ) as romanian cultural heritage or smth ( for sweet moneys ofc ), 
  yeah but ofc when it comes to non-embarrassing people , like sz\u00e9kelys and * their * culture , it 's suddenly the citizenship that matters, 
   romanians  being allowed in hungarian parliament pick one, 
  yeah i know , we have the ` ch ' sound in hungarian too :p i mean that english speakers usually replace this sound with ` k ', 
  i wrote it with the cz because i can not type the \u010d so easily :p i was asking this because to me this seems a lot like a name made up during nationalism ( like the name of bratislava for example , but referring to historical hungary as ` magyarorsz\u00e1g ' is also like that ), 
  i thought you were one of those types who think that the native language practice should be above the english practice when talking in english . 
  ( like for example those dutch , who insist on calling their country ` the netherlands ' , because obviously synonyms ca n't exist ) . 
  sorry for being so rude, 
  depends . 
  i think an english speaker might hear the ` ch ' sound from czech like a ` k ', 
  you seemed to imply that this should be or is the practice in english, 
  the real pronunciation is `` che ki ya '' though , not `` che hi ya '', 
  we 're talking about english , not czech . 
  just because the distinction does n't exist in czech , it could very much do in english , and in english `` czech '' never means `` bohemian '', 
   3 historical lands / \u010cechy , morava , slezsko / i never understood this . 
  is czechy the real name of it in czech or is it just made up ? 
  i think it would be `` chej\u00eda '' . 
  not sure if the final ` ia ' is a diphthong or not, 
  nah , it 's ** cs ** ehorsz\u00e1g . 
  and unlike literally every other word which includes the czechs , this one is actually pronounceable . . 
  inb4 a terror attack happens with naked isis members, 
  you could , but then again why would you want to ? 
  do you really want to , for example , buy bread on saturday , then only have shitty bread on monday , or have to go buy bread on monday 6am ? 
  i would n't , personally, 
  according to the government , it did good to employment in smaller businesses actually . 
  had to wait until monday or do the shopping on saturday . 
  they did it because everyone knew that the upcoming referendum on it would result in an overwhelming support for being able to buy stuff on sundays , which in turn would lower fidesz 's popularity even more , so they did it like this to avoid that defeat, 
  which country ? 
   barbaros never heard of a more fitting name for someone ever . 
  i do n't think there were any actual protests , but it was well known that everyone hated how it was, 
  from nowhere , the ban was initiated by kdnp , the coalition partner of fidesz , a christian party nobody voted for , ever, 
  exactly . 
  yeah , ofc , i 'm not saying it is , but my point still stands : people are forced to only make babies later in life because career , which to me seems very bad . 
  heh , we would ally them before they could invade . 
  afterall , hungary is also maintaining the neighboring countries ' ~ ~ tourist ~ ~ local people problems , soooo ... 
  nobody ever became rich from tilling dirt however . 
  it 's great but we do n't have anything else  the land we stole from you :p gib, 
  i know this was meant to be a joke , but that 's basically it . 
  who the fuck would want * our * land of all the land ? 
  this is way past the ideal age to make children though , isnt it ? 
  `` a nagy @ - t\u00e9rk\u00e9p '' means `` the big map of @ '' in case anyone 's wondering, 
  it 's not common to believe this anymore , but there are still many people who are called `` balog ( h ) '' , aka . 
  `` left-handed '', 
  this is about nations not countries, 
  they literally put slovaks in front of us ... 
  that 's not the reason , that 's just how i think it could be fixed, 
  no , a mouflon, 
  and you know , the fact that he 's catholic, 
   it should not be equal ; they are different countries with different governments and policies . 
  yeah this is what we should fix in my opinion . 
  the national governments are just weakening the eu and to be honest , they do n't have any positives to them anymore, 
  i never heard anybody use that word though . 
  today they 'd say ` mutyizik ' instead :p, 
  the difference is that the articles put the ` killed ' in the front , where the implied `` there were '' or `` were '' can be easily understood as such , whereas this one has it at the very end , which makes it much harder to understand . 
  with the same ordering as the articles you linked , the title would look like this :  at least 19 ukrainian servicemen [ were ] killed in march , despite the ceasefire, 
  i do n't think a transitive verb like ` kill ' would require this to imply that there was an object , especially not in the active, 
  indeed , thats fucked up . 
  especially if you realize that most who campaign for the ban are men , aka . 
  people who will never have to suffer from this ban . 
  this is unacceptable, 
  well , there are some idiots who think that the fetus ( that is unconscious , and unable to think and doesnt feel anything ) has its rights to decide if it wants to die or not .
