  italy . 
   josip jela\u010di\u0107 jelasics b\u00e1n in hungarian  butthurt still , eh ? 
  why would i be butthurt ? 
  jelasics got rekt to shreds with his smug attitude at p\u00e1kozd and basically made it clear that croatia would go back to hungary , and later you needed the * serbs * of all people to liberate you and still did n't become an independent country . 
   thinks jelasics is a national hero  complains about people selling their souls, 
  you ca n't be that naive ? 
  why would we give out the precious key to understanding our language to an untrustworthy company like google ? 
   mother is `` mama '' ( latin mamma for `` tit '' ) in your silly language it 's not lol btw ` materina ' is the most obvious word for it, 
   nobody can understand your silly language tfw slavic idiocy . 
  the point of having a national language is that you can insult foreigners ' mothers without them ever realizing . 
  long time no see, 
  shit , i was looking for the right word and messed up also , we took all the good parts slavness and got rid of all the shitty parts . 
  the shitty parts being things like `` being a slav '' , `` speaking a slavic language '' , you know . 
  and then we added goulash and paprika, 
   implying that half the hungarian army wasnt late to that battle anyway also [ this is how ] ( https://www.google.hu/search?q=p\u00e1kozdi+csata+2013&amp;client=ms-android-google&amp;prmd=ivmn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewikv5ph0s7pahwctxokhrfxbgyq_auibygb&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=512 ), 
  * proudly reincarnates battle of p\u00e1kozd *, 
   nikola \u0160ubi\u0107 zrinski you mean zr\u00ednyi mikl\u00f3s :p obviously the most hungarian person ever, 
  i do n't live in budapest , so no ... 
  i 've only once seen some weird ass japanese tourist group , literally no idea why they came to my town though, 
   what 's not neutral about strasbourg ? 
  it 's literally the capital of alcase-lorraine , the place which symbolizes the worst moments of european history , german and french nationalism ? 
  just no . . 
  put it in brussels , or something that 's central to the eu like vienna or frankfurt, 
  vienna would be the best tbh, 
   tourists  being here, 
  if you ask people from outside the country , then all of it :p otherwise , it 's the sz\u00e9kelys , the pal\u00f3c people and sometimes gypsies, 
  i did n't downvote you, 
  bretagne does too but who cares ? 
  everybody understands that way too, 
  exactly . 
  france is probably one of the most centralized countries in the world, 
  the other name for it here too is * koleszzuhany * `` intern shower '' ( though in an average * kolesz * this method is probably more hygienic than a normal shower ), 
  the main point is that it 's pretending that you actually had something done while not really , which was very common in the ussr, 
  one i learned literally today : * szovjet zuhany * ( soviet shower ) when you just put on shitload of deodorant on yourself and call it a shower, 
   it shall be organised on a decentralised basis lol, 
  i love that first paragraph , save for the parts about the fatherland it 's really well made, 
  ofc . 
  it 's mainly there to act as a help to aspiring corrupt politicians and to easily manipulate the masses with cheap propaganda, 
   politicians  viewed favorably lol, 
  political marriage of the cultural concept of nation and the state, 
  same, 
   esperanto is a really good product to quote you , `` i laugh in the face of this '' . 
  i have made better ones myself for fun . 
  it 's really not . 
  just like any other language , the only thing keeping it alive is the speakers ' will to do so  esperanto 's massive vocabulary is not the work of one man , but a natural evolutionary process . 
  it isnt the work of one man , but the last part is simply a big old lie  people who hate / x / can go to hell til not thinking a sound should be in a language that 's supposed to be `` universal '' is literally just hating on a sound . 
  so , why are you hating on / \u0263\u02b2\u02b7 / ? 
   `` a\u016dto '' and `` e\u016dropo '' are perfect adaptations of those word roots . 
  except it would be way better if you did n't make the diphthong mandatory : auto and europo and you let the speakers decide how many syllables that is . 
   there are no exceptions to the rule that - o signifies a vowel , - a an adjective , and so on . 
  is that why `` unu '' is an imperative verb ? 
  and `` dektri '' is infact an infinitive one ? 
  ohhhh wait  tell that to my friend jose . 
  go meet literally anyone from italy please  `` mi estas laca '' is less common in esperanto than `` mi lacas '' . 
  ahem and how do you that to something like `` katarina estas hungara knabino '' ? 
  this sentence literally taken from the first lesson of my esperanto textbook . 
  thing is , that word ` estas ' would be reduced faster than ever . 
  btw `` knabino '' , that onset is also not auxilliary language-worthy  what is this , fucking russia ? 
  nah , infact just an ongoing change in english , nevermind that though  nominative/accusative is a fundamental grammatical distinction . 
  dative/genitive is taken care of by prepositions . 
  you realize `` fundamental grammatical distinction '' does n't make it something special . 
  it could also be taken care of by a preposition ... or ignored entirely when everything is obvious from context ...  ido was actually a fake project funded by the french government to disrupt the esperanto community and destroy esperanto by divide and conquer . 
  here you are replying to what exactly ? 
  i say `` ido is actually way better '' , you say `` ido is just an evil plot from the evil enemies of esperanto '' . . wtf man , present arguments , not completely random unrelated shit  also your hating on esperanto 's accusative is kind of funny considering that hungarian 's accusative works much like esperanto 's . 
  `` how dare you think that your language 's features should n't be in an international auxiliary language ? '', 
  all while talking about how * your * own language should n't be the auxiliary language . 
  if there 's hypocrisy in the world then this is it . 
   lots of things you want to change about esperanto [ ] are things that would make it more like hungarian . 
  and thats the other great hypocrisy right after the previous one  your criticisms of esperanto are typical of someone new to the language or does n't speak it haha that 's rich cause i speak it . 
  2/10 would n't adopt . 
  is n't that bad from someone in an age where linguistics was n't even quite accepted as a science , but lets just forget about it already . 
  it 's not something special . 
   `` federation of nation states '' that 's a bit misleading though , i would definitely say no as long as it involves nationstates , even though i am a federalist, 
  literally ask anyone on / r/conlangs and they will make better auxilliary languages than esperanto . 
  as a speaker of a non-ie language , esperanto is overrated as fuck . 
  it 's just as confusing , irrational and full of unnecessary stuff . 
  seriously , \u0125 ? 
  diphthongs ? 
  using ` h ' knowing full well how romance speakers ca n't pronounce it ? 
  differentiating li and \u015di ? 
  copula literally two closed syllables ? 
  a future tense ? 
  the lies about `` impossible to not recognize the word 's type '' ? 
  accusatives ? 
  but no dative or genitive ? 
  just look up ido , it 's already a semi-popular auxlang that 's better than esperanto , but even that could be improved imho, 
  the accent means a long vowel because in hungarian words cant end in a short o, 
  france is basically a big agglomeration of paris under that system . 
   european union : internal market , foreign policy , human rights policy , monetary policy and corporate taxes . 
   nation states : all other policy areas , except for local issues . 
   municipalities : only local issues that are specific to a certain area ( parking , zoning plans , building permits , public order etc. ) . 
  imho : eu : constitution , central legislation , central executive branch ( like the cia and fbi in the us ) , military policy , foreign policy , monetary policy * guidelines * , educational policy nation states : should be abolished altogether and replaced with purely cultural organizations that are based around individuals and not area . 
  they could have a say in educational policy and run schools regional level and perhaps an additional intermediate county level : economic policy ( state capitalism and subsidies and stuff like that + infrastructure ) , some legislation , monetary policy * guidelines * , healthcare to some extent municipality level : local issues , local executive branch ( police , healthcare ) , etc, 
  the wonders of nationalism here, 
  not german , but hungarians always call everything by its hungarian name , except a few that are not well known to have hungarian names ( gdansk - dancka , lviv - ilyv\u00f3 , wroclaw - boroszl\u00f3 ) . 
  literally every single thing that was in the old kingdom of hungary is referred to as using the hungarian names , and then some , like b\u00e9cs ( vienna ) , krakk\u00f3 ( krakow ) , velence ( venice ) , lipcse ( leipzig ), 
  hungarians always called it pozsony . 
  most probably dont even know its official name, 
  hungarians also often say k\u00f6nigsberg, 
  weird because in hungary many people would still say k\u00f6nigsberg,
