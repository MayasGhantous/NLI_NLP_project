  think he was using formal . 
  if there was an i at the and then it would be pronounced like that as well in english . 
  also i speak italian , do n't need to explain this to me, 
  `` never miss a good opportunity to swear . '', 
  summarizes it well, 
  jesus christ man , chill, 
  t\u00f6k also means testicles . 
  also many types of vegetable are called t\u00f6k anyway , [ here 's a wiki link ] ( https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/t%c3%b6k_ ( n % c3 % b6v % c3 % a9nynemzets % c3 % a9g \\ ) ), 
  trump is basically a putin, 
  there 's no way there 's gon na be 50 % . 
  barely more managed to show up for the elections , and here there 's a whole big ass movement campaigning for people to not vote or vote invalid . 
  unless fidesz bribes the entire countryside , there is simply not gon na be enough people interested, 
  that is real hungarian , it 's also fucking hilarious . 
  `` bazmeg ez s\u00f3s '' ( fuck , this is salty ), 
   it 's a whole different layer on top of dutch society , and the two rarely cross . 
  yeah , that happens with every other minority everywhere else . 
  just to use an example i witnessed personally - hungarians in slovakia barely ever interact with the slovaks and vice versa , that does n't mean hungarians are n't integrated , it 's just that they form another community . 
  you ca n't force people to talk with people they do n't want to talk with . 
  but the `` expatcrowd '' limbo is integrated, 
   if you speak the language is n't speaking english good enough in the netherlands tho ? 
  because it 's better to be protected by a competent army than by a useless army . 
  * odabasz/bebasz/odak \u00far / bek\u00far * - literally `` to fuck something somewhere '' , which basically just means to put something somewhere violently . 
  obviously this is a great opportunity to use swearwords for no reason , which is something you ca n't really do in other languages sadly . 
  * r\u00e1ngat * and * cib\u00e1l * - to try to make part of something move using quick ( sometimes violent ) bursts of movement . 
  this is just too useful . 
  and also a great euphemism for masturbation ( faszcib\u00e1l\u00e1s - * cib\u00e1l * ing the dick ) i could probably find way more but i 'm too lazy, 
  * t\u00f6kfej * , literally `` testicle-head '', 
  gendered pronouns make exactly zero sense . 
  hungarian has only one pronoun as well : * \u0151 *, 
  day before yesterday : tegnapel\u0151tt day after tomorrow : holnaput\u00e1n, 
  it should n't count if it has more than one root word . 
  yeah , but for example m , n , u , r , h , k , g , e , i are rarely ever like in print , and even the s you mention is often cursive , such as in sz i usually write it like that . 
   so most people drift to something closer to print letters eh , i would n't say most people . 
  usually capital letters are drifting towards the print ones , but the small ones do n't . 
  bit like hungarian ty but less affricated, 
  i 'm 90 % sure that it 's just a direct translation of his irl name ( ` black ' is a pretty common name in hungary ), 
   a p\u00e1rizsi mer\u00e9nyletet bev\u00e1ndorl\u00f3k k\u00f6vett\u00e9k el  ( the attack in paris was committed by immigrants ) that 's just a straight up lie . 
  i 'm not eligible to vote but i 'd vote invalid, 
  orb\u00e1n is also a trump supporter , corrupt as fuck , he also controls almost all the media ( except rtl ), 
  this is annoying as hell , coming from a learner of italian . 
  in hungarian you would * definitely * use the conditional and not the subjunctive in that case . 
  it 's actually not as bad as one would expect . 
  * ami k\u00e9t h\u00e9tig n\u00e1lad van az a ti\u00e9d * ( if you have something for two weeks , then it 's yours - the eternal rule of borrowing things ) * csak az a csaj foglalt amin fekszenek * ( a girl is only taken if someone 's lying on her - basically , unless the bf is present you can flirt ), 
  there 's also cookie - kuki ( childish term for dick ), 
  \\  not keeping a room reserved at home for the emergency alcohol supply, 
  pfft , so you do n't get hammered in the morning already ? 
  how do you even survive the workday ? 
   their flag is a big plus hah , and they say they 're neutral . 
  since theres still no motorway here ( fucking centralist bullshit ) , i do n't really see foreign trucks at all, 
  there 's such a thing as diacritics . 
  if there ai n't enough letters you can always make more - \u00eb or \u00f6 would do the job for \u042a, 
  yeah i knew that , i think most people know it too, 
  what i was saying that his name too , is a region in hungary so his name is confusing as well, 
  [ chokito - nem dugn\u00e1m de megenn\u00e9m ( 1:02 ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qyvylgx9ly&amp;ab_channel=g%c3%a1borgyebn%c3%a1r ), 
  fortunately that was n't as prominent in hungary because the successor of the communist party was in parliament too , and from 1994 it was also in power, 
  yeah , we are usually not that crazy on the whole `` omg muh country so gud !!! '', 
  circlejerk, 
  i really do n't understand why the scandinavians feel so good about themselves with this . 
  this was the case since ever in all of the eastern block . 
  hungary had it since 1938 for cryin out loud, 
  hopefully montenegro and albania would be the next group of countries , followed by serbia , bosnia and kosovo . 
  if there 's trouble in the uk then we might see applicants from that general direction too, 
  i would say most transdanubian major cities would qualify , gy\u0151r , p\u00e9cs , kaposv\u00e1r , sopron , veszpr\u00e9m these are amazing cities , contrasted with the post-soviet industrial places , like miskolc , \u00d3zd , duna\u00fajv\u00e1ros or tatab\u00e1nya, 
  we have that word in hungarian too , ` cs\u00e1v\u00f3 ' is just a synonym for boy though, 
  yeah i know , ally france . 
   obviously you can develop your provinces if you want , but you do n't have infinite mana , better to start out in the lowlands or northern italy that already have high dev if you 're doing that . 
  no because you wo n't even be able to take a single province before being coalitioned back to the stone age . 
  not to mention nicolas [ s\u00e1rk\u00f6zi ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/hu_microregion_1.1.24._tolnai-s%c3%a1rk%c3%b6z.png/1280px-hu_microregion_1.1.24._tolnai-s%c3%a1rk%c3%b6z.png ), 
  this is actually hilarious . 
  do they do it on like fidesz-y facebook pages or what ? 
  i genuinely never saw it, 
   lmpvs / l\u00e1mpavas = `` lamp pole '' usually for political news implying to hang them from the lamp poles do they actually use this ? 
  lmao, 
  * h * - hogy - that * nm * - nincs mit - you 're welcome * np * - no problem - you 're welcome * pls * - please ( also pronounced as if it was a hungarian acronym : p\u00e9eles ) * kb * - k\u00f6r\u00fclbel\u00fcl / k\u00e1b\u00e9 - roughly * j\u00f38 * - j\u00f3 \u00e9jt - good night that 's most of it i think, 
  your link is misspelt . 
  it should be [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/and_quiet_flows_the_don ), 
  the poem * nem tudhatom * ( i ca n't know ) by mikl\u00f3s radn\u00f3ti . 
  it was written during ww2 and it basically talks about how the outside powers who will eventually occupy hungary know literally nothing about it and how all of his reality and everyday life is just a map for all those people, 
  ` thou ' is actually not formal . 
  of ` thou ' and ` you ' , ` you ' was the formal one . 
  and the proper form you 're looking for there would be * thy * anyway, 
  actually many people just say `` eks !, 
  '' , because eg\u00e9szs\u00e9gedre is a long word :p, 
  that is very common tho, 
   minimum age is 18 what the hell are you talking about ? 
  there is n't a minimum age . 
   if you are underage you probably wo n't be offered a drink in public . 
  just bring someone over 18 if you go to a bar with a dickhead of a bartender  also in rural areas it is quite common to start the day with a shot of p\u00e1linka . 
  older folks do it in cities too, 
  southwest definitely has it too, 
   the point is usually just to show their respect by trying this is so true . 
   if they are just making no sense \\  implying you ca n't just use your hands to make it understandable ... :p, 
  hungary was a republic in 1848-49 tho ( ok maybe constitutional monarchy , idk actually ), 
  lol he got btfo 'd, 
  there arent that many right wingers here . 
  nono i mean the people who are seriously fanboys of this stuff . 
  did n't say those did n't exist . 
   or this stuff , which is often used as cover pictures for books about hungary . 
  it 's a fake tradition , these clothes were never widespread , and more importantly there are n't any people who live like this today . 
  idk if this is just me but that always makes me think `` these are almost certainly jobbik supporters ''  or they might believe we 're slavic .
