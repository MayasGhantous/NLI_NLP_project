   most racists - practically all of eastern europe . 
  right wingers are racists everywhere, 
  that 's not even related to what he was talking about, 
  hopefully the one with serbia so the border fence would have to be moved lol, 
  * austria-hungary or we rebel again . 
  this time we win as well because you ca n't call the russians, 
  i have literally zero idea what foreigners think of the country, 
  it used to be friendly here too , but it kinda fell out of use in favor of hello and ciao , so today its more of an old people thing, 
  i know of mortacci all ` anima tua e dell ` anima dekittamuort . 
  italian friends told me this, 
   but the consonant cluster '' . . stb . . '' is a bit difficult to pronounce . 
  weird , in hungary `` szervusz '' is more of an ` old people talking to young people ' type of greeting, 
  vaffanculo is better tbh, 
  or a samurai sword in san marino, 
  minority rights, 
   ` miss great britain ' was recently in the tabloids for being `` stripped of her title '' for having sex ( apparently ) on a reality tv programme the fuck ? 
  because if i want to look at hot women i have way better options , and honestly who cares which girls other people find hot, 
  it 's great that they actually used caps lock for that . 
   panna panna is a pretty common girls ' name in hungary . 
  til what it means, 
  no , that is the actual socialism . 
  the one you 're thinking of is social liberalism, 
  hungary got independent via a mutual agreement with austria , so i guess austria ? 
  not sure, 
  i do n't think we have any . 
  due to the language barrier we usually do n't interact with our neighbors that much, 
   kind of our former brother ? 
  we prefer brother-in-law, 
   everyone 's a land stealer to you . 
  tell me about it, 
  ohh , that makes sense . 
  thanks, 
   ron how come that is the abbreviation of the romanian lei ? 
   when you guys cut off a few zeroes at the end or when hungary cut off 29 zeroes :p, 
   one of the most vivid memories i have from going to hu as a child , was a hungarian arguing and begging the border guards . 
  there were restrictions as i said you could n't bring anything you wanted and you needed to get that permit from the state so it was messy as hell, 
   you would n't necessarily notice you just crossed a border can confirm . 
  we accidentally crossed to austria on a school trip  after the fall of communism , people could cross both ways actually , you could cross before the fall of communism too , i believe there was a rule like once every 3 years ? 
  and they would limit how much money you can exchange as well, 
  italy . 
  i have friends there , i speak a bit of the language , and it 's an all-round amazing place, 
   i will not speak for non-russian peoples of european russia i saw a tatar guy around this sub , hopefully he sees this question and answers , cause i 'm really really interested in that, 
  hungarian is the official language , there are schools that teach slovak , romanian , croatian , german and a single rusyn one ( which is also the school which has the least students in the whole country , 9 ) . 
  and other recognized minorities are bulgarians , gypsies , greeks , poles , armenians , serbians , slovenes ( vends ) and ukrainians , who all use their native language to some extent . 
  the bunyevci also use their native language but they 're not a recognized minority yet, 
  sort of both . 
  i always preferred american though, 
   it is not noteworthy at all to see a car from 2016 right in front of a truck from 1979 at a stoplight . 
  pft . 
  here it 's not noteworthy to see an audi a8 next to a horse drawn ... thing . 
  something like [ this ] ( http://www.hunsor.se/transsylvanien/lovaskocsi.jpg ), 
  well i never saw the aqueduct . 
  it 's the country you go through while going to italy :p where that faggot restaurant chain charges half an euro for the toilet . 
  fuck those guys . 
  otherwise they 're ok i guess . 
   hungary is coolish < 3, 
   we get shit food floating in pesticides and other shit from there i mean what do you expect , that we export the good food or what ? 
  tourists have more money so people are more hospitable towards them, 
  sounds like a paradise to me, 
  why would n't we ? 
  i always saw ukrainians as european, 
  and there 's snooker too, 
  yeah exactly . 
  geography does n't really matter , unlike politics, 
  czechs are known to be bitchy about this . 
  idk why, 
  austria is basically the same as hungary really, 
  centralization is bad for everyone outside the capital , so i have to agree with you . 
  over here in hungary we also have a terrible amount of centralization , and its annoying as hell . 
  although its nowhere near as in france, 
  autonomy as in they would get their own parliaments and stuff ? 
  because that would mean a nasty amount of audis again . 
  ( also , why are those areas named so weird ? 
  they should be just called dalmatia , slavonia & baranja , istria & rijeka , croatia proper and northern ), 
  ok well that is retarded , but you could just cut spending for that then . 
  rearranging those boundaries would just mean that it would be gerrymandered to shit and that the zupans would get even more money each . 
  larger municipalities means that youd need to spend more per municipality because all the municipality-run things like police fire departments etc. 
  would need to have a higher range to be efficient . 
  they would need better equipment and stuff to cover thevlarher area . 
  the more municipalities thing is also more flexible - if theres an emergency situation somewhere then you can rearrange stuff more efficiently, 
  yeah but that gdp goes to the top 1 % only, 
  why ? 
  the only explanation i could think of is that you really really hate centralization, 
  there are buttloads of municipalities everywhere . 
  you need one for each town . 
  and then you group some of those municipalities together so theyre easier to manage . 
  if you did what you are suggesting then there would be anarchy in many places ( because the municipality has important functions like running the police ) , and larger municipalities would mean more places where stuff isnt efficient, 
  probably some overseas special thing, 
  which of those were the habsburgs ? 
  it was also the thing that tried to make your nation disappear , should n't you hate it then ? 
  also your minority laws . 
  i personally love [ radetzky march ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzjsurups-o&amp;ab_channel=alexanderherzdorf ), 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpclf_siovm&amp;ab_channel=mrmike0083 this is actually even better imo , but there 's no annotations . 
   \u043a\u0443\u043c / \u043a\u0443\u043c\u0430 that 's probably the same word as hungarian * koma * , which just means friend but is a bit archaic . 
  btw no we do n't as far as i know . 
  exactly . 
   to the hungarian request in the parliament in po\u017eun / bratislava in 1790 that hungarian should be the official language in croatia which did not happen - that proposition included that croatian and slovak counties could still use latin for as long as they wanted to . 
  according to the article i already linked you once ( page 10-11 ) :  according to the proposition , the king would have to swear an oath that he does n't bring in foreign languages to hungary , [ . . ] laws would be made in hungarian except punitive law , officials use hungarian ; ** and the only places allowed to keep latin would be the croatian and slovak counties ** , for as long as they like and this is sourced from ` authentica versio diarii hungarici autoritate comitiorum regni procurata . 
  ' , which you can find [ here ] ( https://books.google.hu/books?id=xcdeaaaacaaj&amp;pg=pp2&amp;lpg=pp2&amp;dq=authentica+versio+diarii+hungarici+autoritate+comitiorum+regni+procurata&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=c4llaag2md&amp;sig=nuyohhbzxtgzp-2nvmiwewe10ei&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiulojn8troahubmzokhxocdpwq6aeihtaa#v=onepage&amp;q=authentica%20versio%20diarii%20hungarici%20autoritate%20comitiorum%20regni%20procurata&amp;f=false ) . 
  my latin is n't that good but you can probably find the actual proposition in there,
