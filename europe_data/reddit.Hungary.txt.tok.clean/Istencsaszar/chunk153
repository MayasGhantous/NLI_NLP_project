   but it was the reply . 
  to what was it the reply then ? 
  but sure , yes , there has been efforts from 1844 onwards , but then after 1848 the efforts stopped again . 
  and after 1867 , even after the treason from jelacic hungary gave the croats * some * leeway from magyarization . 
  croatian was an official language in croatia-slavonia , and hungary even recognized dalmatia as part of croatia . 
   why would anyone believe that hungary would be more '' merciful '' when it gains even more power ? 
  because croatia helped them in the war ? 
  why would anyone believe that austria would be merciful when it gained power back ? 
   hungarians openly supported the idea of sole hungary from carpathians to the adriatic that is something you claim without any sources , and i never heard this in hungary either . 
  people usually romanticized the idea of a hungary enclosed by the carpathians , surrounded on all sides by huge mountains . 
  nobody cared about croatia  the croatian side replied with that could n't possibly have been the reply , because as i said , there was no such law . 
  according to the same article i already linked you , there was a proposition to make it a mandatory language ( to learn as second language , which is a thing in every country even today btw ) , but the habsburgs said no to that as well . 
  i mean for fucks sake , in hungary , hungarian only became state language in 1844 , how could they possibly have mandatory hungarian when it was n't even the state language ? 
   this was the croatian goal from the day we lost our independence well save for bosnia it would 've been achievable , as hungary was n't very far from occupying vienna and if that happened shit would 've gone south for the habsburgs as a whole . 
  croatians siding with hungary for the battle of schwechat would basically have made hungary win the independence war . 
  and that would 've resulted in enforcing the demands of hungarians , which did n't include croatia . 
  you may not know this , but croatians always were considered allies and friends , save for this one part about jelacic . 
  i 'm pretty sure croatia would 've been restored as it used to be , maybe except some parts around osijek/esz \u00e9k or syrmia because those used to be part of hungary proper . 
   hungarian language was forced upon in schools in 1790. , in order to '' hungarianize '' croatia according to [ this ( page 5 ) ] ( http://mek.oszk.hu/07800/07881/07881.pdf ) , this is not true :  according to this new policy , in universities they use latin . 
  in the first three classes of middle schools ( in grammatics classes ) instead of german they must use the native language of the students . 
  where most of the students speak hungarian , they should use hungarian , which we wish to spread to the whole country . 
  in so-called normal schools we do n't want to neglect the teaching of any language ; we only wish that hungarian , as the proper language of this country , is given special attention . 
   create a hungary from carpathians to the adriatic hungary never spanned to the adriatic , though it did own a single port on it ( fiume ), 
   croats were oppressed by hungary even before like when ? 
  i did n't know of that one  was not a small gain for croatia sure , it 's important , but considering the fact that few years later hungarians got way way more just because , it probably was n't worth it even from the croatian perspective . 
  i personally think that siding with the hungarians in that particular time would n't have been a bad idea . 
  sure , kossuth was a rabid nationalist , but he was the same guy who made the first minority rights laws in the world . 
  surely he would n't have been so tough with people who fought on his side . 
  the same jelacic got from the habsburg he could 've gotten from the hungarians too, 
  [ ban jelacic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/josip_jela%c4%8di%c4%87 ) who sided with the austrians against hungarians in our independence war for some minimal gains for croatia . 
  ironically when hungary became pseudo-independent in 1867 croatia became part of it so all he achieved was that due to his treason hungary distrusted croats completely and therefore croats were oppressed . 
  no , we did n't . 
  hungary 's prime minister was against declaring war . 
  saying hungary started ww1 is like saying that scotland started the falklands war, 
   but not too frequently yeah , though its variants like `` szevasz '' or `` szasz '' are pretty common, 
  holocaust and other atrocities during ww2 . 
  also the fact that we joined ww1 . 
  well it 's kinda separated into two completely different parts . 
  one from an international standpoint , and the other is about the internal hungarian politics of time . 
   fifa would be against it too since it would decrease ~ ~ competition ~ ~ marketability and thereby profits dramatically . 
  ftfy,

  yeah . 
  nothing really prevents you from buying alcohol at 16 , it 's just that it 's legal everywhere - where it 's legal it 's actually less fun to do that, 
  i do n't think so . 
  gypsies would n't report things like this, 
  where should orphans be if not there ? 
  well you probably should n't take pride in what your ancestors did though either . 
  the story of the hungarian flag : people saw the glorious coat of arms and liked the colors on it so they put them on a flag so it 's easier to carry around on pretests . 
   8 million people roughly the same as austria or switzerland . 
  are those ministates too ? 
  none of those are ministates or city states . 
  you could at least have tried a bit harder . 
  its larger than germany ... 
   wut you are literally saying that democracy should n't apply to cases where people would want to make their own countries  where would you subjectively draw the line ? 
  where would you ? 
   yeah we 've seen how successful eastern european mini-states have been . 
  what ministates are you talking about ? 
  i do n't know of any ministates in eastern europe . 
  but if you want to know how successful actual ministates are , take a look at luxemburg , monaco or singapore , but hongkong or macau are great examples too , as well as kuwait and ( depending on what you consider a ministate ) qatar and bahrain, 
  tbh with orb\u00e1n i can only be happy that he does n't have all those powers . 
  those powers are in a better place now, 
  because the eu should be the country here , and the member states just autonomous areas within it, 
  higher number of member states , but less power per member state . 
  the member states themselves have too much power within the eu . 
  most things in the eu are based on member states , while should be based around eu citizens . 
  and i think eu citizens should be able to democratically decide the internal borders themselves, 
   because i hold the same beliefs as those people . 
  that 's very vague  no , democracy does not work like that . 
  democracy does n't include people voting about what the find important , if what they find important would create countries that your ancestors did n't want to exist ? 
   if so then why do n't we allow for every town to vore on whether to be independent or not ? 
  well towns are not exactly similar to areas with millions of people in them , but in my opinion , why not ? 
  city states are amazing, 
  we were talking about catalonia ... 
  but you can make a similar case for italy - why would you deny the right to vote to leave , just because some dude decided a 100 years ago how he thinks italy should look like ? 
  is n't this like , against democracy ? 
  so basically the ancestors who were looking only after themselves are so important today that you should n't even be able to vote to correct their mistakes ? 
  is that what you 're trying to say ? 
  nobody made any sort of contract with any other partner . 
  it just so happened that they were born in a state they do n't want to be part of . 
   in the end it can trigger movement across europe with similar ideas in the uk , belgium , italy among eu members and this is exactly what europe needs right now . 
  all these new sovereign states have to remain in the eu and that would be perfect . 
  of course that is blocked those who would suffer a lot - the government of spain and the uk , who passed some law that automatically excludes breakaway states from the eu . 
   all of the regions of a country made it what it is today . 
  you are acting like countries today are some sort of godsent perfect entities that are the way everything 's supposed to be forever . 
  what you 're saying is true , all regions make a country what it is , but if some people do n't want to partake in it anymore then they should get a vote about that, 
  not communist, 
  what ? 
  austria had nothing to do with that , that was france, 
  we love them for making us basically independent and bringing us our latest golden age . 
  ** slovakia ** they are literally just slavic hungarians . 
  they do n't seem to accept this though . 
  also muh southern slovakia ** ukraine ** they 're awesome . 
  cheap shit ( cigarettes and prostitutes etc ) and also hate russia ** romania ** they 're ok i guess , just mention transylvania ** serbia ** balkan wars and vojvodina ** croatia ** bros , even that statue of jelacic ( the traitor ) does n't point to budapest anymore ** slovenia ** they 're the highway to italy ** austria ** as they say , they 're brothers in law, 
  budapest , vienna , rome , berlin , london and i have traveled through ljubljana and zagreb twice . 
  and been to barcelona as well if that counts, 
   france , capital city of ~ ~ europe . ~ ~ arabia ftfy / s ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ( sorry ), 
  the ` lj ' is a sound that 's somewhere between * y * and * l * . 
  so yoobyaaana or looblaana , whichever you prefer . 
  in english i 'd probably use something like lube-yaana,
