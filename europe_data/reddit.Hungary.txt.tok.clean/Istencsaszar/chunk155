  stasi wasnt unique st all , and it would work better with kgb then, 
  eh , there are still people who go to church in villages every sunday, 
  religious people are the old people , except in the most backward villages . 
  hell i 'm pretty sure the young generation is mostly irreligious there too, 
  anywhere you are willing to learn the local language and integrate into the society . 
  i personally would recommend eastern europe , here you will never have to worry about islamists , and people will be very accepting as long as you at least try learning the local language ( which is pretty easy tbh , they offer you courses iirc ) . 
  i 'm saying this because i literally know a girl from izmir who lived here and so i have a pretty good idea about what secular turks are like and i can understand them ( and their concerns too ), 
  it 's the law that you can drink but not enter the bar , or you ca n't drink under 18 at all ? 
  why ? 
  minors would find other ways to drink if it was illegal . 
  if you were a parent would you have your kid buy alcohol illegally or legally with their friends ? 
  to buy , that is fair and square . 
  to drink is a different question . 
  are you banned from drinking alcohol if someone else bought it for you as well ? 
  because that 's where it gets stupid . 
  in hungary you can buy at age 18 , and drink at any age . 
  the law assumes that the person over 18 is responsible enough to not give minors too much alcohol, 
  but then how do you get the drinks to the underage people ? 
  they can legally drink , no ? 
  or are they barred from drinking too ? 
  i swear to god , sweden has more authoritarian rules than soviet russia on alcohol, 
  jesus christ that sounds horrible . 
  the people who run the bar definitely had too much free time and money on their hands . 
  anyway you can still wait outside the bar and send in the 18yo, 
  well , there 's no racism really , but people would most likely give you weird looks if they saw you around . 
  it 's simply not common to see east asians in general, 
   you ca n't drink until you 're 18 at bars/resturants in sweden wait , so you guys did n't know you can get a token 18yo to the bar and make him buy drinks ? 
  native : hungarian was mistaken for a native speaker many times : english can communicate basic stuff : italian , german understand written text : french , spanish , other romance languages and latin if i moved to somewhere i would definitely learn the local language as well as i could, 
  legal parent is a symbolic thing , both can become legal guardians of the kid, 
  meh , it 's really just the naming here again , they get the same benefits, 
  translation :  gays and lesbians , even those living together , can adopt children , but only one of them can become the legal parent of the child . 
  the other person can legally become the kid 's `` nevel\u0151sz\u00fcl\u0151 '' , the same thing you would get if your parents divorce and marry someone else, 
  dat surname though, 
  there 's literally one black family in my town , and they are treated just like anybody else . 
  married , yeah , sort of , though it 's called civil union then . 
  and yeah otherwise they can do whatever they want like , you know , any citizen of the country, 
  germany switzerland austria are the central european countries, 
  kek what ? 
  hungary is probably the best friend of turkey in the eu, 
  oh , well okay then . 
  i thought you were one of those who get offended when ppl call the former eastern bloc eastern europe, 
  yes they are . 
  stop getting offended by this, 
  yup . 
  please . 
  i want to live in the european federation instead of the shithole that is hungary, 
  i am an eastern european . 
  i wo n't move where you ca n't drink in public . 
  we call it `` bankautomata '' or `` atm '', 
  what is fika in swedish ? 
  because in hungarian it means that green slime that comes out your nose ... 
  i honestly cant see how it would even be possible to get profit for the government from healthcare . 
  its not the point , and its not necessary . 
  in hungary even the national railway runs a deficit, 
  like the protestants in northern ireland ? 
  stop stealing it then ... 
  yeah . 
  if it wasnt summer i would say that it wont melt at all , but god knows how hot it will be at the time , so it would be better to eat it right after, 
  if you keep it in the fridge , no, 
  til many european countries nickname themselves . 
  i honestly never thought that was a thing, 
  over here we call the whole world the `` zoo of god '' ( j\u00f3isten \u00e1llatkertje ), 
  how was it helpful ? 
  to me it looks like that romanian intellectuals just wanted to feel like they are high cultured and above everyone else, 
  over here , nope . 
  its something you can only buy in hungary so try it out, 
  you can do all these different languages here too ( i 'm learning italian for example ) , but it 's mandatory to choose two : english an another one . 
  if you learned german in elementary , then english and german it is . 
  it may not be required per se , but most gimn\u00e1ziums do n't let you choose two non-english languages at all, 
  in a * gimn\u00e1zium * ( high school i guess ) , you have to choose two languages , and one of them has to be english, 
  me too, 
  nor would i, 
  what i hate is their incredible double standard - how much they loathe the idea of a federal state - meanwhile they literally live in one , except they 're dominating it entirely , which obviously makes it ok, 
  same here , though i guess from my side it 's more understandable . 
  i would go as far as to say that i would prefer direct eu rule over the country , rather that this mess where the country 's government is just a weird middleman really who just steals money, 
  yeah , it 's pretty obviously propaganda , and a bad one at that . 
  i mean i would watch it was like quality propaganda . 
  i mean most american films at least * try to conceal * the underlying `` muh ` merica '' and they can be enjoyable , but this one is just plain obvious, 
  yeah , unfortunately we do . 
  it 's a useless shit of a subject , yet we have to learn it * and * it 's mandatory to do a maturity exam of it . 
  i 'd take it out the curriculum as a whole , it 's so fucking pointless, 
  i 'm really bothered by this use of `` multicultural '' and `` multiculturalism '' . 
  why is it so necessary for a multicultural city to be made of ` immigrants ' and ` natives ' ? 
  people be acting like there are no cities which are multicultural natively . 
  but there are , and * those * are the truly best multicultural cities in europe . 
  so , i 'm saying luxembourg , barcelona , cluj , bolzano , brussels , ko\u0161ice etc etc. 
  in hungary there 's really just the sz\u00e9kely accent that is easy to recognize , but thats not even in hungary , there are regionalisms which immediately give away where they are from but not every region has these, 
   far eastern part , by the border with hungary , has such a different dialect that we need subtitles to understand them . 
  in hungary we actually call them a different name - they are ` vendek ' instead of ` szlov\u00e9nek ',

  in hungary ? 
  yeah , probably, 
  i meant that we could build a new city like australia built canberra and brazil built brasilia . 
  ( sorry if you understood for first , im not sure if you were joking or not ), 
  not sure which half you mean, 
  there are no official ideas so far afaik , but here are some off the top of my head : - brussels - luxembourg - strasbourg if we want it to be on the french-german border ; if we want it on the east-west cultural divide , then szczecin , vienna or bratislava - vienna ( maybe prague ? 
  ) , because it 's roughly in the middle - rome , because roman empire stronk - new capital built somewhere maybe , like australia or brazil ? 
  i think that would be a little unfair to our massive cultural heritage , but it 's an option worth considering, 
  latin or esperanto could make an easy neutral solution , if there was a need for such a language, 
   `` everyone is a french citizen , and the rest does n't matter '' type civic nationalism this sounds more like `` we do n't acknowledge the existence of the non-french '' to me . .
