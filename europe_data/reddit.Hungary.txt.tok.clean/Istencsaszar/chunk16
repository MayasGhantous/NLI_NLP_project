  never seen it before , thats why i 'm asking for other examples of this, 
   current year  still artificially modifying languages to fit people 's agendas the fuck did that poor language do to you, 
  really ? 
  never heard of this . 
  can you provide a source , or atleast some examples ? 
  anyway , i still think this title would be very confusing to non-native english speakers, 
   19 ukrainian servicemen killed in march yes it absolutely does, 
  are they really hating on you though ? 
  over here they 'd just think/say you 're an idiot and leave it at that . . 
  you messed up the title , it should be `` were killed '' , not `` killed '' . 
  this title would imply that the 19 ukrainian servicemen killed the rebels , not the other way round, 
  eesti can not into nordic ? 
  the only anthem from actual transylvania is the sz\u00e9kely anthem , which does n't mention it, 
  the hungarian one . 
  it only implies that it was the reason of hungarians being enslaved , but nowhere does it mention it directly, 
   both way it 's hilarious to sing during the olympic and other peace celebrating events . 
  you tell me , it 's about as awkward as singing `` torn by bad luck for too long , give us a good year ; this nation suffered enough , for both the past and future '', 
  those guys with the hats tho, 
  * nordic, 
  and the sz\u00f3zat ( kinda like a secondary anthem ) is n't much better either :  and the grave , where the nation is being lowered to ,  nations surround  and in the millions of peoples '  eyes , a tear of mourning wells . 
  in the hungarian one there 's also this part :  \u00c1ltalad nyert sz\u00e9p haz\u00e1t  bendeg\u00faznak ** v\u00e9re ** which translates to :  by you won a nice homeland  the blood of bendeg\u00faz so this is technically also a mention of blood, 
  they are already using `` the west oppresses and kills muslims '' as a a recruiting tactic, 
  do n't you see that killing him would just fuel isis 's recruitment machine ? 
  that would just make him a martyr, 
  an ethnic group arriving there 800 years earlier is not colonists , maybe their ancestors they never even heard of were , but they definitely arent . 
   you kill a child no , you kill a some unconscious blob of flesh that 's only alive by the biological definition . 
  it does not feel anything . 
  it 's most definitely not a baby , nor a child . 
  i favor a complete ban on the polish pm, 
   german and hungarian colonists relocated in those parts of the country that 's the stupidest bullshit i 've read in a while, 
  youve never been to eastern europe , have you ? 
   which are much more closer to you culturally top fucking kek, 
  this is exactly my point . 
  they continue what they do , even if they are being attacked for it, 
  i knew it was gon na be topkek but i thought it was gon na be [ this flavor ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf_c4ftwais&amp;ab_channel=kekkats ) instead, 
  3 hours now . . we should definitely contact his mom, 
  maybe yeah . 
  but this is just another reason why the hungarians would never have accepted this proposal as is, 
  you 'd consider the 14yo edgy dude badass too if a butthurt retard murdered his mother and the kid continued to spit on him, 
  they are seriously badass, 
  jesus christ fam , calm down, 
  * third, 
  there 's the czechoslovak equivalent of that , the massacre in pozsony , but that one somehow does n't have an english article : https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/pozsonyi_sort%c5%b1z, 
  im not even sure about that . 
  looks about 50/50 of historical transylvania and other places, 
  yeah , but unlike the real life scenario , this wouldve been an artificial , unnecessary change in definition . 
  and keep in mind that this definition is only a thing for ethnic romanians - the local hungarians still use the traditional definition ( aka . 
  someone from oradea is definitely not from erd\u00e9ly ), 
  nah , i dont think they gave a fuck . 
  they wanted everyone to just speak hungarian , preferably as mother tongue, 
  why would it be misleading ? 
  would jews who identify as hungarian not count as hungarian or what ? 
  transylvania had freedom of religion , i believe after 1876 hungary as a whole too, 
  why name it after the historical translyvania then ? 
  what connection would it have to this new state anyway ? 
  yeah , i said nazis because they were the first to have a jewish option on censuses . 
  i was saying this because the jews in hungary still identify as hungarian first , i suppose the situation was similar in pressburg, 
   hard to imagine in 1912 for example hungarians giving rights to all others that they would say o.k we forgive you well , this is exactly what happened with hungary and the habsburgs after 1867 and yes , a switzerland-esque system would 've worked well for hungary, 
  yeah , but keep in mind this was before ww1 . 
  also , bukovina ? 
  seriously , bukovina sorted as transylvania ? 
  yes , but think about it , back then many people were isolated from society ( especially in the mountains , i mean who do you talk to in the middle of the carpathians ) . 
  they may not even have a real , strong nationality identity , so it would be hard to do a census that way ... also i think it 's a very nazi thing to sort the jews as a nationality that way , i mean they would be counted as such in the religion section anyway , no ? 
  exactly what i meant was that if the slovak stuff was n't shut and you know , if hungary did n't act like slovaks were somehow foreigners , which they absolutely were n't . 
  um , that what the map calls `` transylvania '' extends to bukovina , to oradea , to timisoara , but does n't include sz\u00e9kelyland ... that 's so far off from any definition of transylvania, 
  it was in the kingdom of hungary ... the official name was pozsony, 
  * pozsony :p although to be fair , the 1910 census was incredibly biased towards hungarians , so that 40 % would more likely be a 30 % and more germans instead . 
  tbh hungary could 've stayed that way , but with slovak , romanian , german etc. 
  as official languages . 
  yeah this is one of the worse ones, 
   uzhorod in slovakia  not giving a shit about what names like `` bohemia '' , `` transylvania '' , `` carniola '' , `` galicia '' * actually * mean jesus christ, 
  ilyv\u00f3 is still like , 500 + years old , people at the time used `` lemberg '' ( austrian influence was strong ), 
  kinda like hungary today . 
  best way to get from p\u00e9cs to szeged ? 
  do n't mind that it 's roughly twice as long as direct travel , it 's still faster, 
  hungarian : the basque of eastern europe, 
  those hungarian names cracked me up there . 
  `` gr\u00e1c '' and `` innzbruk '' . . jesus christ , everybody spells these like in german . 
  also , `` ilyv\u00f3 '' is a medieval name , people use `` lviv '' , `` lvov '' or rarely `` lemberg '' , most would n't even recognize it as a name for lviv . 
  also plze\u0148 has a glorious hungarian name , which is pilzen . 
  i guess people think it 's related to the word ` board ' ? 
  oh , so basically , it all runs in the hungarian-populated areas of slovakia now ... delightful . 
  i 'm not from budapest , but is n't the direction the railway enters bp a bit weird ? 
  should n't it go like the m1/m7 , from the west directly and not from the north ? 
  but they are right there on the map, 
  it has all the borders marked , even ones that were n't present in 1912 ( talking about the internal hungarian borders ), 
  what ? 
  if austria is `` artificial '' , then what is germany ? 
  relevant username, 
  according to trump , yes, 
  jan mayen comes to mind, 
  greenland would n't take them in, 
  i guessed so, 
  the point is to not only sprinkle the girls , but annoy them with it at the same time, 
  like a human condom ? 
   there 's also the white knights protecting them . 
  protecting them from fertility ? 
  how noble from them :p, 
  yeah , it would . 
  i think if you go by mathematic definitions , these are just numbers too , they 're just written differently .
