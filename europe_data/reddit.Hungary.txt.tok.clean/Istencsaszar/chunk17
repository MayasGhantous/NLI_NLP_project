  is this the time of the year again when we post suggestive easter sprinkling poems ? 
  aw yisss, 
  i do n't want to sound like a dick , but those are not equations , those are just algebraic expressions, 
  i like how you just added dunkirk without anyone noticing, 
  i mean how did they get in the university . 
  why did the university accept them, 
  religion is irrelevant . 
  the real clash here is of civilized society and medieval values ninja edit : also the holy land is already under the control of the west so shit 's irrelevant, 
  then why do n't they jihad america ? 
  europe definitely is n't in a religious war, 
  these are studying in a university . . you know , where we educate our top minds . 
  how did they get there with these skewed ass worldviews , huh ? 
   crusaders isis really thinks that the west gives a fuck about religion . 
  i heard of more intelligent chimpanzees, 
   we will say it 's from latin anyway ... and we will insist on finno-ugric/turkic, 
  good on you  keep it up, 
  serbs did nothing wrong amirite, 
  tumblr is leaking, 
   that 's the start of decline of ~ ~ yurop , ~ ~ civilization when man has to listen to woman . 
  ftfy ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  no , that 's still not hate speech . 
  calling her a terrorist would 've been , but this isnt, 
  that is a ` buzog\u00e1ny ' in hungarian, 
  i do n't think we have many demonyms at all . 
  maybe the only unusual one i can think of is * pesti * , which refers to anyone from budapest , not just from the pest part . 
  also , people from n\u00f3gr\u00e1d county are referred to as * pal\u00f3c *, 
  this is not hate speech at all . 
  more like : no survivors = no problem, 
   women end up getting about 20 different kids of cheap shit cologne on them oh , poor women amirite . . instead of getting poured with tens of buckets of water and possibly getting cold and/or pneumonia , they get to smell bad for a day ... 
   no wet girls um , okay ... 
  in hungary we use mm/dd , but very often we write out the month atleast partially : 9/11 would be szept .11, 
  szalonna in hungarian ... ( slavic words starting with more than one consonant are hard ), 
  oh , that is amazing  hope you will like the city , 
  yes , it ultimately comes from a turkic language , 
   or korb\u00e1\u010d ( in slovak ) lol , ` korb\u00e1cs ' means the same in hungarian :p btw over here we pour buckets of water on girls , or in the urban places , cologne, 
  you have to understand though - the only reason you have different names for the two entities is because of propaganda and to de-legitimize hungarian claims to the rest of the hungarian-populated territories . 
  the kingdom of hungary never changed its name officially between 1914 and 1922 , and it officially existed from 1000-1944 . . and you know , magyar tribes before going to the carpathian basin lived in modern day ukraine , and bordered the polish tribes there , so it 's not like they never did . . 
  no idea tbh . 
   do n't hungarian elementary and high schools teach mandatory hungarian grammar and literature ? 
  [ source ] ( http://epa.oszk.hu/01200/01259/00025/pdf/bar02.pdf ) `` according to the public education law [ . . ] students belonging to a national or ethnic minority [ . . ] according to their choice , can get education in the mother tongue , hungarian and their mother tongue or in hungarian in kindergarten , elementary school , middle/high school and in interns . 
  the education [ . . ] can be in different language too . 
   but you ca n't talk to the police because they do n't understand slovak i believe in hungary you are given a free translator if you do n't speak hungarian  most of the world countries do n't allow dual citizenship still . 
  right around the corner , romania allows it , why ca n't slovakia ? 
  oh , hungary is still clean from terrorism completely i 'm sure ... * looks at map * orb\u00e1n , you had one job . . 
   you end up with isolated communities yes , that is already the case . 
  but if you have two ( semi - ) isolated in the same town for example , why 'd you give preference to one of them ? 
  especially based on native language ? 
   it 's pretty common to require teaching the national language in school that does n't make it right integration does n't mean forced assimilation , it means making the two communities compatible with each other , which is already the case in slovaks and hungarians . 
   with my version not included for some reason you can edit wikipedia to include your version too, 
  not to mention that this word has derivatives , like `` lagzi '' which means `` wedding '' . 
  kinda gives you an idea of what we do on a wedding traditionally : pp, 
  yeah , but my version would n't have included bohemia , but it would have included wallachia, 
  no , the hungarian word comes from the verb ` lakik ' , which means to kind of ` eat well ' or ` feel well after eating ' ( kind of a rare word on its own ) . 
  this one is said to be connected to another verb with the same form ` lakik ' - `` to live '' , which is of definite finno-ugric origin, 
   current year  still believing that nations have ` rightful lands ', 
  translation to avoid misunderstandings :  pole , hungarian , two good friends  they say together : `` kurva any\u00e1d '' ( your mom 's a bitch ), 
  i do n't think a period as barbaric as the 19th century should be a reference point to anything . 
  i was referring to everything before the 1800s, 
   it was the hungarians who started it . 
  true . 
   our people and governments are now closer than ever . 
  yes . 
  though our governments and their respective people do n't seem to be particularly close :p, 
  i do n't think it 's a private school . 
  it looks like it 's run by the government or the slovak minority council ( the latter would make more sense but i would n't bet on it ), 
  honestly , do you think that your average hungarian or slovak would consider the other inferior ? 
  they were both equally fucked over by serfdom , so they had much in common , and much to fight for together . 
  they did n't though , and the habsburgs used the good old `` divide et impera '' tactic, 
  looked it up , and they come from completely different origins, 
  i do n't think any of that matters , honestly . 
  as long as we were strongly united under the kingdom , and both sides saw each other as equals , we could easily be considered one nation . 
  after all , this type of thing is n't foreign to hungarians at all : even originally the seven hungarian tribes consisted of 5 that spoke hungarian and 2 that spoke some turkic language . 
  i do n't see any reason why the same thing could n't have worked with slovaks ( as in , being united as one nation , like the hungarians did with the blood oath ), 
  there 's a reason it 's called the * kis h\u00e1bor\u00fa * , aka . 
  little war :p, 
  not true . 
  in budapest there 's a monolingual slovak school , and they teach hungarian as foreign language ( not because they have to , there 's no official regulation on that , they just chose to do so ) [ link ] ( http://www.szlovak-bp.sulinet.hu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=48&amp;itemid=55&amp;lang=sk ), 
  yes , but after 1945 everything was suddenly the other way round : [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarians_in_slovakia#population_exchanges )  in the spring and summer of 1945 , the czechoslovak government in exile approved a series of decrees that stripped hungarians of property and all civil rights  ethnic hungarians were pressured to have their nationality officially changed to slovak , otherwise they were dropped from the pension , social and healthcare system we should just move on tbh . 
  they meant that we ( hungarians and poles ) always helped each other when the other needed help, 
  i 'm glad you liked the city , 
  :( i was so excited for a sec because i thought it meant something similar, 
  this is exactly what i imagined the hungarian and slovak military capabilities to be like, 
   lakom\u00ed wait , does that mean what i think it does ? 
  does it mean the type of `` eating as much as you physically can '' gathering , like in hungarian ( `` lakoma '' ) ? 
  nationalism is retarded . 
  r\u00e1k\u00f3czi for example in his war for independence fought together with slovaks against the habsburgs, 
  holy shit , this is the first time i have seen my hometown mentioned on reddit . 
  how come you came here ? 
  just imagine matthias corvinus ' empire + polish-lithuanian commonwealth . 
  holy shit , that would be some crazy superpower, 
  it 's actually hungary that [ fought a war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slovak%e2%80%93hungarian_war ) to have a border with poland, 
  maybe if he considered hungarians and slovaks one nation , like literally everyone before nationalism came about . . 
  ok , here we go , i heard these from a hungarian friend from slovakia : - students required to learn slovak language and slovak literature . 
  this gives them less time to learn actually useful things . 
  ofc i 'm not saying that slovak is not useful to learn in slovakia , but it should n't be * absolutely crucial * for someone living in , say , kom\u00e1rno or dunajsk\u00e1 streda - government people are required to always speak slovak ( for example policemen , firemen and doctors , which is , to say atleast , problematic in places with no ethnic slovaks ( kom\u00e1rno and dunajsk\u00e1 streda come to mind again ) - minority schools are required to do their administration in slovak ( this is just wtf ) not to mention the ban on dual citizenship and the fact that autonomy is n't considered an option to counter all the above . 
  these language laws make sense if you only consider places where hungarians do n't overwhelmingly outnumber slovaks, 
  i think blaming him and edvard bene\u0161 at the same time would make more sense , also the whole communist czechoslovak post-war government ( ofc also the 1867-1918 hungarian governments too ), 
  yeah , but the political folklore over there is still terrible , your politicians are still very much against hungary, 
  there 's still the language laws which are in place with no incentives to change it ( afaik ) . 
  fico hates hungarians too , i do n't think it 's hard to realize . .
