  slovakia is culturally the closest to hungary imo , they just hate hungarians ( at least they happen to elect politicians that do ), 
  masterminds ? 
  wtf dude . . 
  idk, 
   i almost want human rights to go out the window when dealing with terrorists . 
  they should be tried as war criminals tbh , i mean that what they are, 
  i think it 's rather because `` tele van a '' rolls off the tongue very nicely . . 
  you could also go with this word order : * `` tele van a l\u00e9gp\u00e1rn\u00e1s haj\u00f3m angoln\u00e1kkal '' * . 
  not sure how common this is in transylvania tho, 
  this rhyme though . 
   standard hungarian feels a bit alien tbf budapest hungarian is fairly weird without a doubt, 
  may i ask you which country you 're from ? 
   people do n't have access to all of the information . 
  that 's hilariously wrong in the age of the internet . 
  they do have access to literally any information , at any time . 
  those are autonomous regions i believe, 
  which is n't part of romania ... it 's part of moldova and ukraine, 
   ~ ~ warsaw pact and ~ ~ the ussr ; \u0ca5_\u0ca5 such a catastrophe ... ftfy, 
  the definition implies the 50 % + criteria , no ? 
  it has to be the `` greater part of '' something , aka . 
  greater than everything else in the group combined, 
  well it does mean `` i suck '' , but that would not imply sucking dick like in hungarian, 
  [ here ] ( http://www.monetarium.hu/images/webshop/34822_1fd0d1e38cdc9aeb0ac25d31a129f01d.jpg ) , have this 1 milliard b-peng\u00f6 , where ` b ' refers to a billion on the long scale , in total 1 000\u00a0000\u00a0000\u00a0000 000\u00a0000\u00a0000 peng\u00f6, 
  i have already said this in the mapporn post , but in hungary you can also say * ja * , * persze * , * aha * and a bunch of others , it 's just that * igen * is the official one , im not even sure if its the most common at all . 
  i think even they only care about romanian continuity in transylvania , which * is * a debatable topic . 
  i cant imagine them caring about the rest of romania, 
  weird . 
  i never found it particularly hard to remember ( except whether its * dnepro - * or * dnipro - * ), 
  eh , we mainly have funny town names , not street names . 
  * bugyi * , means `` panties '' , * her\u00e9d * , means `` your testicles '' . 
  * porn\u00f3ap\u00e1ti * ( guess what the * porn\u00f3 * part means :p ) . 
  in ukraine there 's also a village called * nevetlenfalu * , which means `` village without a name '' . 
  after a little searching i also found * ond\u00f3d * , which means `` your cum/semen '' , * csikl\u00f3b\u00e1nya * , which means `` clitoris mine '' , * szopok * ( `` i suck dick '' ) , * csesznek * ( `` they are fucking '' ) , * als\u00f3farkadin * ( ~ `` lower your-dick '' ) and * nagycsula * ( `` large blob of saliva '' ), 
  it probably got crooked when that pretender lost it while riding a horse somewhere . 
  shit , this crown has some crazy history, 
  i think you got it backwards fam  ( jk love you guys ), 
  that makes no sense . 
  alaska is also not in the north atlantic , nor is hawaii , guam or the north mariana islands . 
  those do n't count either then ? 
  uk could still invoke article 5 of nato if necessary for the falklands , no ? 
  if so they should consider the former option, 
  the first one doesnt imply the second one, 
  tell that to the jobbik voters . 
  all the other parties have already shown that they are corrupt when in power . 
  jobbik didnt do that yet , and people think they wont be . 
  basically the fact that they didnt get to steal yet, 
  jobbik is the second-biggest party by now i believe and fidesz is spelt with an sz : * fidesz *, 
  italy is only there because hungary is not on the list, 
   journalists earn jack shit already , and we 're basically taking away their last source of income by blocking adds . 
  they are in western europe . 
  they earn just about enough already, 
  `` nagy '' does n't even mean `` tall '' , it means `` big '' . 
  tall would be `` magas '', 
  ah , the old reddit [ politics-a-roo ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/4ad89n/my_girlfriend_caught_an_ewok_in_the_snow/d0zyvp0?context=1 ), 
  i heard that before , and its amazing , but if you search for a mansi folksong for example , youll find that its hard to understand anything, 
  its / u/citee _ londinius, 
  yeah the emphasis is similar , but the sounds are not . 
  wow , butthurt much ? 
  what is the quote youre referring to ? 
  im just waiting for that anti-irish troll/bigot to explain again that ireland is a `` failed state '' and that it can only survive because of the uk, 
  finnish and estonian sound nothing like hungarian , and they are highly unintelligible - to the point where i cant even understand a single word . 
  they are also extremely far away , so im rarely exposed to them, 
  yup . 
  iirc back in 1703-1711 hungarians and slovaks fought together against austria, 
  its not tolerable though , even given their history, 
  meanwhile in hungary : `` elh\u00fazom a cs\u00edkot '' ( ? i am pulling the line ? ), 
  - i am leaving, 
   `` if you row slowly , you will go far '' we have the same here : `` lassan j\u00e1rj , tov\u00e1bb \u00e9rsz '' ( walk slowly , you will go farther ), 
  i would n't have expected hungary to be so high up, 
  [ bullshit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_european_union_membership_referendum,_2003 ), 
  oh , the `` is this desert botswana or australia '' simulator, 
  because it is the closest linguistic relative of occitan . 
  yeah , but we 're talking about right now . 
  in our upcoming golden age we 're gon na sound like prosperity and depression instead, 
  us is modern prussia confirmed, 
  because it 's not the job of the average citizen, 
  it sounds like poverty and depression, 
   the vowel harmony is certainly the best feature i have ever encountered in a language . 
  ` e ' and ` o ' actually represent two different sounds ; a more open and a more closed one, 
  [ occitan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rphlrrn9be&amp;ab_channel=micagbm ) . 
  it 's just perfect imho, 
  global cs : go players, 
  i mean seriously . 
  roughly 20 % of the road is in the carpathian basin, 
  `` via carpatia '' ? 
  seriously ? 
  that 's the least fitting name for this thing . 
  i support it and everything , but this name, 
  i 'm gon na go with chruscsov . 
  fuck these v 's all over the letters . 
  ( even tho chru\u0161\u010dov still looks way better than khruschev ), 
  [ sissi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/empress_elisabeth_of_austria ) ? 
  there should be a plushie with the design from the last panel in this : http://i.imgur.com/ur66uwr.png . 
  well , ` e ' actually represents two different sounds , sometimes written ` e ' and ' \u00eb ' , and the latter really is a short '' \u00e9 '' . 
  for a / \u00e1 , well thats how it was convenient i guess . 
  many words show alternation between those : eg . 
  very good reply , thank you . 
  i also think that this statenent was uncalled for , but i dont think this was a valid reason to revoke his award . 
  he is ? 
  apparently he said something he shouldnt have said about hungarians in romania and now hes not worthy of an award anymore .
