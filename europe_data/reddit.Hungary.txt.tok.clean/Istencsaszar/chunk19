  because pattern : short o , long \u00f3 . 
  therefore short \u00f6 gives long \u0151 . 
  easy . 
  [ hungarian article on same subject ] ( http://hvg.hu/vilag/20160303_visszavontak_tokes_laszlo_roman_allami_kitunteteset ), 
  sounds so amazing ( eus 7-headed dragon ), 
  our 2/3 majority party got like 25 % iirc, 
  that unified europe is just so gorgeous to look at, 
  well he * is * playing against a bunch of russians, 
  depends though . 
  i honestly couldnt care less about marijuana use , for example , even though it is a crime, 
  exactly . 
  it also helps that i live in an irrelevant ass country , so even the capital seems relatively safe from attacks, 
  it 's actually the sound change from a -  \u00e4 , o -  \u00f6 , u -  \u00fc that 's called [ umlaut ( or i-mutation ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germanic_umlaut ) . 
  the two dots can be called * diaeresis/trema * or * umlaut * depending on their use : french , dutch , greek and spanish use the diaeresis , german , swedish , finnish and hungarian use the umlaut . 
  ( [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diaeresis_ ( diacritic \\ ) ) ), 
  their own business . 
  they were given the opportunity, 
  i think `` b\u00e9kebeli '' today means something more like `` it 's very old but it still functions properly/is still in good shape '', 
  yeah but after 1867 it was like today 's situation with scotland and elizabeth ii, 
  exactly , it 's called the `` boldog b\u00e9keid\u0151k '' , and it lasted from 1867-1918, 
  eww , dude, 
  that we speak a completely incomrehensible language . 
  are these communist-made ones or older ? 
  i will never unsee this, 
  kazakhstan too, 
  it would be better if you had to send `` trianon was fair '' to unsub, 
  no official border per say , but i believe every town with an at least 20 % hungarian population has bilingual signage . 
  not sure about the exact percentage limit . 
  easily . 
  you just need to plant sqrt ( 60 000 ) trees on one edge of your square kilometer . 
  you only have to plant one for every ~ 4.08 meters, 
  sounds like the human centipede from south park, 
  why do you answer to a week old post ? 
  what is this heresy, 
  they speak hungarian, 
  why , what 's wrong with that ? 
  for a slav a random finno ugric root is definitely `` out of nowhere '', 
  he means that `` vil\u00e1g '' hardly resembles `` swiet '' . . 
  ukrainian ca n't into language, 
  it 's like they do n't even bother to make recruitment propaganda . 
  at least this is a thing they do n't waste money to do, 
  i watched the videos because i am very interested in languages , and one more big reason , that is , to experience a language that sounds similar to my native language , because that is something slavs experience all the time , while hungarians simply ca n't . 
   we call ourselves the ~ ~ wallacho-hungarian ~ ~ hungaro-romanian empire . 
   bu ~ ~ ch ~ ~ da ~ ~ r ~ ~ pest is the capital . 
  it is true , hungarian , mansi and khanty are very closely related , but there is no mutual intelligibility . 
  i can safely say this , having watched quite a few mansi and khanty videos and texts . 
  yeah i know ceausescu was the worst of the worst , in hungary it was a popular thing to joke about how much worse the romanians live . 
  i think orb\u00e1n would be more similar to the hungarian communist leader , k\u00e1d\u00e1r , whose policy was literally `` everyone who is n't against is with us '' aka . 
  they left everyone alone who did n't do something against the state, 
  yeah , obviously :p whole thread is basically a joke, 
   i do n't have to speak this atrocious language . 
  fun fact is , you really do n't have to . 
  today you 'd have the right to be schooled in romanian , graduate in romanian and do basically everything in romanian . 
  what ? 
  hungarian sitting in the corner as expected . 
  no one comes close to the mishmashing-from-any-language-at-all level of hungarian . 
  just recently did i learn that hungarian has a number of quite common from old persian , like wtf, 
  oppressed russian ~ ~ minority ~ ~ sex slaves, 
  maybe the romanian government , but definitely not ordinary romanians . 
  im sure hes perfectly ok with anyone who is loyal to him, 
   they have many more rights in romania than romanians have in any other country , ** including hungary ** , yet they 're still not satisfied . 
  tell me what rights do hungarians have in romania that romanians in hungary dont ? 
  name one . 
  protip : you cant . 
  definitely the left one, 
  why couldnt you change sturovo ? 
  some 80 % of the locals already know it as p\u00e1rk\u00e1ny , you could just replace the signs from `` sturovo/p \u00e1rk\u00e1ny '' to `` parka\u00f1 / p\u00e1rk\u00e1ny '' . 
  it would be the easiest thing ever , and trust me , hungarians both here and there would greatly appreciate it . 
  it is these small symbolic things that form the attitudes of our nations toward each other . 
  and yeah , the tatra , matra , fatra thing is weird here too , especially combined with the other half of the coat of arms , which has the duna , tisza , dr\u00e1va , sz\u00e1va thing , of which sz\u00e1va is entirely in croatia . 
  but as i said , you could at least have it not recolored to your national colors . 
  ( btw i heard somewhere that the slovak flag was originally gon na be green instead of blue to match the hungarian colors , but i never found a source , do you know of this ? ), 
  well in slovakia they renamed hungarian majority towns after slovak national heroes . 
  tell me about it . 
  well austria was fucked on a similar basis with south tirol too , but i believe italy doesnt force the local austrians to use italian . 
  well hungary literally fought a war just to have a border with poland, 
  im sure someone from budapest in 1910 would have said similar things `` honestly i dont care/know what language someone from trencs\u00e9n speaks . 
  i never met a slovak in person '' same attitude basically, 
  we are in complete agreement on 99 % of what you typed , there was really no need to type the whole thing . 
  i am still baffled by why you think the language laws make sense . 
  and more things i would add : why do you keep using our coat of arms recolored as your own ? 
  why did you still not rename sturovo back to its original name in slovak ? 
  it is disturbing . 
  you wouldnt want slovak majority towns named `` kossuthv\u00e1r '' either , do you ? 
  and you 'll be saved from everything evil by our savior orb\u00e1n . 
  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/krasso-szoreny_county_administrative_map.jpg . 
  on the european side . 
  do n't worry fam , we will save you from the horrors of living in romania, 
  if they are poles , why was bad that they lived in poland instead of lithuania ? 
  it 's a great argument but not when it 's about today 's borders . 
  it does n't matter why they are poles , they are just poles, 
  :p i 'm saying this because when hungary did this to its minorities it ended up [ real bad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_trianon ), 
   they fund organizations actively hurting turkey well , then again you could give autonomy to kurds or sth . 
  this is a situation that could end up really bad for turkey, 
  yeah , the uk and france are known for their moral high ground , high horse and hypocrisy . 
   polonised lithuanians oh yeah , that 's like the magyarized slovaks argument of czechoslovakia, 
   it 's fiume , and rightful ~ ~ italian ~ ~ magyar territory . 
  ftfy . 
  you 're right on the fiume part tho, 
  sorry , that 's just [ how it is ] ( http://www.bonyhad.hu/mozdulj/contents/events/untitled-1.jpg ) :p,
