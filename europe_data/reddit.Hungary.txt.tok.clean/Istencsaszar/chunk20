  hey , hungary has it all forgiven  just do n't invade again, 
   i dont like how people use english/german words instead of slovak ones , it denies our culture that 's not true , it simply shapes your culture . 
  people here too are upset that hungarians use german/english loanwords , but if you really think about it , this is our culture really , what loanwords we use . 
  hungarian has loanwords from iranian , turkic , slavic , romance , german , greek , gypsy etc. 
  if you go through all the words , you can see the outline of our culture , our history , and i think this makes loanwords a beautiful ( that and the fact that literally 70 % + of the hungarian language is loanwords )  slovakians use 1000years and more when they talk about oppression problem is , that is simply not true . 
  magyarization started with the start of the 19th century , and in the end it was probably greatest mistake in the whole hungarian history . 
  before that , it 's safe to assume that slovaks were considered equal to hungarians , or simply a subgroup of hungarians . 
  i 'm fairly sure neither hungarians nor slovaks learn about this in school , but slovaks fought with the hungarians in [ 1703-11 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/r%c3%a1k%c3%b3czi%27s_war_of_independence#mercenaries_and_minorities_in_the_kuruc_army ) and probably many more times before . 
   slovakia is viewed sometimes as `` felv\u00e9dek '' like it should belong to hungary . 
  * felvid\u00e9k  among reasonable people ( the non-jobbik ones ) it at most applies to the southern strip of slovakia . 
  the reason it 's viewed like that it would be better if it was in hungary is exactly the language laws  lets eat some er\u0151s pista sometime  definitely :d, 
  seriously . 
  stop with your bullshit language laws . 
  stop with the hypocrisy of `` omaigahd hungary forced us to learn hungarian '' when you 're pulling the exact same shit , but in the 21st century instead of the 19th . 
  the us english pronunciation sound is n't even the same as the ipa transcription next to it, 
  you get that the correct pronunciation is always what native speakers use , right ? 
  so for american english it would be the one they use, 
  seriously , do you think the students care when they are getting ready to their final exams in 12th grade ? 
  or you know , any classes where you have to do anything other than show up to pass ? 
  no we dont . 
  source : am a student right now, 
  got you again , romania  :d, 
  he did n't when i commented . .

  then it 's 30/77 \\* 19 = ** 7.4 bn **, 
  \\ ^ this . 
  so much this, 
  what country are you from ? 
  flair up , 
  yeah , i guess you 're right . 
  no , i mean , lets say an islamist from france starts a company , gets rich , then starts funding mosques from his money . 
  what are you gon na do then ? 
  the process will be completely legal, 
  well , id love to see them learn hungarian even more . 
  i wonder what their reaction would be to the fact that the language has absolutely no gender distinction . 
  problem is , they might start something in the eu and then fund from the inside, 
  well , depends . 
  the word can apply either to all slovenes or to only prekmurje slovenes . 
  most people today would definitely use `` szlov\u00e9n '', 
  `` t\u00f3t '' is [ distantly related ] ( http://www.szokincshalo.hu/szotar/?qbetu=&amp;qsearch=t%c3%b3t&amp;qdetail=11488 ) to `` teuton '' , like the germanic monastic order , and `` vend '' is [ apparently ] ( http://www.szokincshalo.hu/szotar/?qbetu=&amp;qsearch=vend&amp;qdetail=12047 ) from the name of venice ( veneti ) ? 
  i ca n't even, 
  both are but this makes it sooo easy to differentiate , today it 's szlov\u00e1k ( ok ) , szlov\u00e9n ( ek ), 
   forever is a long time . 
  it 's also probably the same amount of time it will take for the victim to be through their actions emotionally, 
  / u/hungarynothungry, 
  `` slovak '' in hungarian : ** t\u00f3t ** `` slovene '' in hungarian : ** vend ** ez, 
  i live closer to slovenia but i know more about slovakia . 
  obvious reason is history class , but it 's also because of the amount of hungarians living there , and the fact that i 've actually been there . 
  in that case , sentence them to social work or military service ? 
  if neither , what do you think would be an appropriate punishment for this crime ? 
  montenegro, 
  there are eastern europeans here too, 
  the teacher should get suspended/fired but at least get a criminal record , and the rapists should get to prison forever in a room of 2x2m and no windows, 
   a picture of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , altered to look like adolf hilter  hilter the author apparently ca n't into spellcheck, 
  ooh , so that 's what the name `` kalmar union '' comes from, 
  wow , this is some romania-hungary level of football hoolinganism, 
  the real question is , did \u00dajpest win ? 
  yup , it comes from byzantine greek '' \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03a0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd '' ( eis t\u1e15n p\u00f3lin ), 
  okay , it just left me with ambiguity with ` x ' , because i 've also seen \u03c7 -  x transliteration recently . 
  the hunger for power is strong, 
  flair up , 
  shockingly , italians love pasta a lot . . 
  thanks  i wrote `` kh '' instead of `` h '' to emphasize that it 's not quite the same sound as english `` h '' , and the same sound in for example russian is also transliterated as `` kh '' . 
  i did not imply a `` k '' sound being there , atleast i didnt mean to, 
   joke, 
  looks like something i 'd build in minecraft , but with amazing shaders, 
  would n't the letter ksi be transliterated as `` ks '' ? 
  because the x in transliteration would be the letter khi , like in oxi back when there were those campaigns for nai vs oxi , no ? 
  that 's our motto, 
  why , what do you guys learn in school ? 
  hungary has a rusyn school too , in koml\u00f3ska, 
  many times . 
  they still did n't realize that hungary did n't close off everything coming from serbia, 
  i 'd emigrate if that happened here . . gg everyone who 's responsible, 
  sorry i didnt spot the `` continued below '' on the article, 
  germans are the second biggest minority here already . 
  many towns have german street signs and you 'd most likely be able to do administration in german . 
  you would be considered a `` sv\u00e1b '' ( swabian ) though quick edit : sv\u00e1b is not at all derogatory btw , just the general term to germans living in hungary, 
  how dare you make fun of that sexy [ bety\u00e1r ] ( http://huns2huns.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/sobri_j%c3%b3ska.jpg ) [ bajusz ] ( http://huns2huns.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/leadpic1_3496.jpg ), 
  well that was informative . . 
  croatia can join v4 anytime ... 
  it 's 1102 all over again, 
  orb\u00e1n revises trianon -  he is forever prime minister , no matter what he does afterwards . 
  it would be simply too hard for anyone to make a better candidate, 
  putin looks so cute on that [ pic ] ( http://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2016/02/15/08/gettyimages-499269206.jpg ), 
  europe is writing its history right now , lets hope we dont fuck it up . 
  anyway it 's nice to see this happening, 
  this reminded me of the hungarian film `` a tan\u00fa '' ( the witness ) , where the communist politician would constantly say `` a nemzetk\u00f6zi helyzet egyre fokoz\u00f3dik '' ( the international situation is increasing constantly ) . . 
  you realize the most well-known events of the balkan wars was the massacre of muslims , right ? 
  who is decebalus ? 
  so basically what they are in ck2, 
  citizenship is not in any way even related to nationality . 
  seriously , is there a country to which `` moscow 's confrontational policy '' is n't a threat to ? 
  ninja edit : besides russia, 
  the gypsy is praying next to the road . 
  suddenly a car shows up and the \u00c1vh guys ( secret police ) get out . 
  they say `` what are you doing here ? 
  why are n't you working instead ? '', 
  `` i am praying for comrade r\u00e1kosi , i swear '' `` yeah , i 'm sure you used to pray for sz\u00e1lasi ( basically hitler ) too ! '',
