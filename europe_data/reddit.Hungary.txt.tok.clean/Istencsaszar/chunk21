  `` yeah i did but he 's been hanged already '', 
  tbh those contributed a lot to the education, 
   no effect on the quality of education the not true tho . 
  many teachers stopped doing extra lessons because they arent allowed to be paid for overtime hours, 
  but if you show up a valid id the vendor is supposed to sell it to you because you showed up a valid id , no ? 
  having his id implies their permission . 
  ( i might be totally wrong on this ), 
  idk how things work in the states , but you can also just steal someone 's id ( ideally one of your parents ' ) , then buy it , showing that id to the vendor, 
  for a sec i thought you meant `` the people of rome '' . . 
   lifted wait , do n't they just ask some adult to buy some spirits without parents even having a clue ? 
  relevant username, 
  the next generation would then grow up with girls going to a separate mosque . . 
  i dont see how this would help them with any of the points you mentioned, 
  yay !, 
  barbarism !, 
  thats not how you combat segregation . 
  you make it out like this would have a positive effect on women 's segregation , but it wont, 
  that 's what i 'm doing . 
   letting them pass . 
  because the eu one is too vague for a location . 
  no flag just makes me look like a new guy, 
  i said the exact same thing :  they dont really know how to promote it well . 
  what if i only want to mark my location ? 
  afterall my flair says `` somogyorsz\u00e1g '' , the region which i live in, 
  yeah , makes sense, 
  i wonder how much influence from the ussr it took to get the kurds this communistic, 
  looks like they are incompetent and cant decide what they want . 
  sounds like hungary basically, 
  sexism much ? 
  which is bad because their cause is good but they dont really know how to promote it well . 
  yes,

  i want to sympathize with kurds but god damn they make it hard, 
  this is not the fucking iron curtain , we just want to let in everyone, 
  i did that while on a class trip in some random ass woods, 
  nationalism is literally the worst thing , it should never be revived, 
  i dont think they care . 
  i have a secondary account too , never had problems using them from the same computer, 
  no , fix your own problems and mistakes . 
  that 's the smoothest reking i 've seen in a while . 
  good job sir, 
  yeah but many people create create troll accounts too , to make sure they dont lose karma on their main one . 
  it 's because your account is very young ( 25 days old ) . 
  on reddit young accounts like this usually belonf to trolls or people from other websites who just want to express their toxic opinions , / u/polymute accused you of being one of those guys . 
  its mostly germans who assimilated , mainly because of the fact that they were considered nazis under communism . 
  the decrease of the slovak population is mainly due to the czechoslovak population exchange policies i believe . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.mfa.gov.hu/nr/rdonlyres/9f2d180e-538e-4363-aa5e-3d103b522e3b/0/etniang.pdf ) a sheet discussing minority rights in hungary . 
  the important parts would : - rights to use own language in legislation ( via translators ) - rights to create national assemblies - language use and education in native language - media in native language ( there 's croatian programs on the local channel here for example ) - any group of at least 1000 people can become an accepted nationality - street signs in native language if needed etc. 
  ( [ here 's ] ( http://juris.oldportal.u-szeged.hu/download.php?docid=29759 ) another source in hungarian , just for clarification that i did n't pull these out of my ass . ), 
  so what i 'm saying is basically - we are not trying to assimilate anyone anymore , you 're not even required to speak hungarian if you belong to a minority that lived there for 100 years . 
  til sweden has less people than hungary . 
  holy shit , 160k immigrants , that 's insane . 
  that 's called a [ * f\u00e1nk * ] ( https://www.google.hu/search?q=f%c3%a1nk&amp;rlz=1c1gigm_enhu562hu562&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj8m5gcz-vkahucqjokhfmqd9gq_auibygb&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=799 ), 
  i was there too , and i spoke freely with other hungarians , it 's not that slovakia would pull literally magyarization-tiered shit , but the mentality of these laws seem to be similar . 
  it 's horrible that a eu country can do this to 10 % + of its population . 
   right now hungarians have all the rights um , no :  minority-language schools are obliged to run their administration and documentation in slovak and the same applies to the health service . 
  the armed forces , the police and the fire service are to be monolingually slovak . 
  this last , by way of example , creates interesting scenarios - thus in a hungarian-speaking area , the firemen are very likely to be all hungarian-speakers , but when putting out a fire , they must speak slovak to each other and also , of course , to the owner of the house where the fire is . 
   all public inscriptions must be in the state language  gravestones must all be recarved , unless they are already in slovak . 
  lets not pretend that hungarians have the same rights to native language use as slovaks . 
  ( [ source btw ] ( https://euobserver.com/opinion/28440 ) ), 
  it would actually be beneficial to society if only those voted who actually knew a thing or two about politics , so i think it would be better to just discourage voting for those who do n't feel like any party represents them well, 
  many sz\u00e9kelys are hungarian-romanian dual citizens , so a sz\u00e9kely traditional would still be at least a 50-50 share between romania and hungary , no ? 
  for your second point : the specific region , aka , south tyrol . 
  in this case , sz\u00e9kelyland , but because it does n't exist , you have to make the question of who better represents them as the original creators . 
  and i 'm fairly sure it 's budapest , not bucharest . 
  yes, 
  qwertz keyboard ( the only true keyboard ), 
  orb\u00e1n just wants to have putin as an ally just in case . 
  i dont think poland has to worry about that though . 
  last time hungary had a superpower ally that threatened poland , it was hitler himself , and when he asked to help with the invasion of poland , mr horthy wrote him a letter with basically `` lol no fucking way '' , and the military [ carved out a piece of slovakia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slovak%e2%80%93hungarian_war ) to secure a polish-hungarian border and we took in ~ 50 thousand refugees, 
  yeah , as i said , hungarians in the spirit of 1848 simply redefined `` being hungarian '' , to mean `` someone who speaks hungarian '' , which was ridiculous , especially trying to enforce the language on those who did n't speak it . 
  this enraged the slovaks , romanians etc. 
  but the same things have happened the other way round : hungarians have been ussr-style deported from southern slovakia ( bene\u0161 ) , and for example the slovak language laws are a thing today . 
  you could do things to solve our relationship right now , but you do n't seem to be interested in doing that . 
  yeah but still , romania claims to be the nation-state of ethnic romanians , no ? 
  so it 's some crazy mental gymnastics to think that a product of non-ethnic romanians would be rightfully theirs , no ? 
  `` in the same house '' is an understatement , slovaks were literally considered hungarians for a long time , unfortunately modern nationalism fucked it up with the mindset of `` only those are true hungarians who speak the language '' , which is very sad in my opinion . 
  eh , the hate is very much real for many hungarians i know , not sure if for the people or just the government . 
  i suppose the neonazi types would hate the people . 
  weird . 
   we are more similar than we think yup , we should know this . 
  unfortunately our education does n't really focus on this , it would be amazing if it did . 
  you can safely include slovakia in that too . 
  it 's just recent history that incited the hate currently going on, 
  the fact that there is no name mentioned still makes me think this is bullshit . 
  no way anyone would have agreed to this from hungary, 
  but russia offered trianon revision !!! 4 !! n\u00e9gy !, 
  ( jk love you guys ), 
  because dae eastern europe is literally like subsaharan africa . 
  they have no idea how communism promoted gender equality, 
   ( cheek ) kissing [ mouth kissing too ] ( http://mult-kor.hu/image/article/index/20.%20szazad/brezsnyev_honecker.jpg ), 
   intrusive comments about your physical appearance that made you feel offended so if i told someone that they 're ugly , would i be committing sexual harassment ? 
  that 's fucking ridiculous, 
  sounds like bullshit . 
  approving something like this would be literal political suicide , no wonder why there 's no name stated in the article , just `` hungarian officials '', 
  source ? 
  why would that be a good idea ? 
  make sure to not try to claim it this way in hungary . 
  you might get lynched or something,
