  both are hilarious tho , almost as hilarious as hungarian nationalists, 
  username checks out, 
  bruh, 
   nor roman italians from rome probably disagree , as do romanians, 
  i dont think i 'm gon na go for k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs because they are sold literally next to the local tesco and its not that much a special food for me , but mici looks glorious and i 'm totally gon na be looking for it  thank you btw , i loled at the misspelled `` k ** \u0171 ** rt\u0151skal\u00e1cs '' in the background, 
  not like it mattered tho , wallachia was a dependant entity both before and after :p my point was that hungarians always thought of the carpathians as the border . 
  it used to be the actual border , but now it 's kinda the `` border of relevance '' , aka . 
  anything past it is irrelevant and foreign, 
  odorheiu , but we 're gon na pass through a few interesting cities , like alba iulia , so i might as well try a few types of good food, 
   at least the goulash is just as divinely good !, 
  haha goulash never changes :p btw , i 'm gon na go to romania , what are some foods i must try ? 
  i went through it literally yesterday , it 's like it always is : dirty , except the touristy parts ( which you 've probably been to )  the separatist flag of the szekels on the parliament building meh . 
  could be worse . 
  i saw a sz\u00e9kely flag , but with the colors swapped to red-black , next to a pro-jobbik flag ( red-white * 4 ) on a house in miskolc few days before , for example . 
  i do n't think expressing solidarity towards those guys is * that * bad . 
  i mean , its definitely not the greatest crime of the parliament . 
  and btw they are n't even separatist , just autonomist . 
   stole interesting word to use for a treaty signed by both the hungarian and the romanian government, 
  oh , okay , then we are really better at water polo :p but you should really get a flair, 
  ew , such a copycat name . 
  simply `` europe '' , `` europa '' or `` european union '' would be just fine, 
  slovakia is like a little bro , no matter what anyone else says , also amazing places and people . 
   as a general rule , quite nice and reasonable . 
  you got to experience the non-crazy ones :p, 
   we fought on the same side in ww2 hey , we too . 
  and we didnt betray you even . 
  that 's not true . 
  romanians are amazing people , its just the centralized ruling from bucharest that we hate, 
  romania is pretty cool , unless you go past the carpathians ( and who would want to do that ? ), 
  what country are you from ? 
  flair up , 
  the whole of dalmatia is just amazing . 
  you got ( almost ) all bonus points , nice . 
  looks fine written down , but for example look at the land reforms of 1921 in romania , which were very unfair towards the hungarians . 
  atleast there were hungarian schools according to the wiki , but for example the hungarian university in cluj was simply forced out and had to relocate to szeged , so i would take that with a grain of salt . 
  yes , they wanted to and thats fine . 
  what im arguing though is that probably the elections and representation and whatnot probably wasnt the pinnacle of democracy under romanian military admistration . 
  i would compare it to the recent referendum in crimea : everyone knows that they want to join russia but that referendum was simply not legitimate . 
  and yeah , the ethnic lines have changed quite a bit since then ( i blame ceausescu for that , not sure if there were other major factors ) . 
  1941 was signed by the romanian government . 
  i dont even know what were arguing about here though , i dont think `` annex '' even has a connotation that would imply whether or not the cession happened legally . 
  i think `` annex '' carries a meaning like `` integrate into an empire '' in which case both 1920 and 1941 would be annexations . 
  edit : for your other point , im fairly sure that by dec 1918 romania didnt even control the whole of the annexed area ( according to the reunification document `` transylvania , maramures , crisana and banat '' ) . 
  so i would sorta doubt that they could make fair representation in certain places . 
  i just realized that frisia is `` fr\u00edzf\u00f6ld '' in hungarian , which makes it one of the few places that have '' - f\u00f6ld '' ( - land ) in their name . 
  the only other place to have this privilege is baszkf\u00f6ld ( basque country ) i think . 
  so if you set up 3 random courts you can make any conquest fair and happy ? 
  i guess then i 'll set up 3 courts , consisting of jobbik supporter hungarians , sz\u00e9kelys and random romanians . 
  i guarantee you that two of these would approve anything . 
  you just need to select the correct people . 
  ok , redone it , but i 'm fairly this would n't be hungarian majority either : http://i.imgur.com/yx2aziv.jpg . 
  maybe with the blue correction it would be . 
  my [ quick sketch ] ( http://i.imgur.com/axcnb9a.jpg ) includes that hungarian blob around simleu silvaniei , i wonder if that would be hungarian majority when summed up . 
  though only after i uploaded did i notice that i could 've done better with those villages next to satu mare . 
  hell , partium is literally the balkans of the carpathian basin . 
  also paging / u/bezbojnicul, 
  that looks like an ethnically reasonable claim , but also it would be devastatingly bad if you take a look at the infrastructure . 
  will do . 
  rmdsz only makes sense until a hungarian autonomous area happens , after that they will probably dissolve . 
  so it makes no sense for them to care about the rest , they dont want to lead romania , just represent the hungarians in the parliament, 
  what about salaj ? 
  i wonder if it was possible to gerrymander a hungarian autonomous area which would include satu mare and oradea both , but still have a majority . 
  i will totally do more research later, 
  i dont think that was in any way legal tho, 
  wasnt it like , romania literally wrote a law that transylvania belongs to it now ? 
  wow , you 're right actually . 
  i should check demographic maps before making such claims ( [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:romania_harta_etnica_2002.png ) \\ ) . 
  i wonder what the percentage of hungarians would be in that roughly-triangle, 
  it was presented as serious here too , but it 's orb\u00e1n 's favorite tactic to announce something absolutely outrageous , then pose as a literal hero for making the deal less bad, 
  also the hungarians of partium were historically very concentrated in the main cities ( satu mare , oradea , perhaps arad and zalau ) , and since ceausescu they dont make up a majority anywhere anymore , save for a few villages, 
  it was also `` kinda hard legally '' for romania to acquire transylvania back in the day - basically what i 'm saying is a lot of shit has to go down for that to happen , and i definitely wouldnt count on it . 
  ( obviously the situation was completely different ), 
  i do n't think it will though . 
  not even orb\u00e1n wants to throw money out the window that much . 
  he would much rather build a stadium or two from that money, 
   ~ ~ shit ~ ~ igen , i 'm already assimilated . 
  ftfy :p, 
  but would n't that be gender ? 
   do we get this if i marry a hungarian girl ? 
  : d i promise to learn the language . 
  :p yes , if you raise your kids to be glorious magyars \u2122 , then you dont even have to move out of romania ( got ta keep them population percentages high for trianon revision ), 
  thing is , sz\u00e9kelyland only contains about half of romania 's hungarians . 
  ( 610k out of roughly 1.2 million ) . 
  yeah , that would be near impossible to do without romania being in schengen or some other treaty that would allow free travel between hungary and sz\u00e9kelyland . 
  and not to mention that only half of the hungarians in romania live in sz\u00e9kelyland . 
  and that also desregards that it would be kinda hard to legally secede for sz\u00e9kelyland , and obv . 
  no one wants a civil war . 
  not sure how you mean that, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communist_purges_in_serbia_in_1944%e2%80%9345 to add, 
  wtf is hungary doing at the 8th place even . 
  i 'm not used to this, 
  yeah . 
  the thing is , though , that this will lessen the influence of hungarians in romania on the national parliament, 
   ukrainian  pro-russian what, 
  sounds good . 
  gib all that sweet monies , austria, 
  yeah , i mean the uk is officially at was with isis , no ? 
  pretty sure it 's turkey . 
  i only knew of the proto-germanic to old norse final / z /  / r / before, 
  this is literally what i learned this from before i wrote my comment,
