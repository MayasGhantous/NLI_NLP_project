  til rhotacism is n't excusively / z /  / r / . 
  europa got friendzoned, 
  http://www.szokincshalo.hu/szotar/?qbetu=&amp;qsearch=ered&amp;qdetail=2672 this says its from the ugric age, 
  the point of the map is to represent as many currently spoken languages as possible . 
  the same could be said about low german , luxemburgish , breton , irish , s\u00e1mi , romansh and scottish gaelic too . 
  this is not 1984 , erasing their language from popular culture wont erase them from existing and especially not make people think that it never existed . 
  ` erd\u0151 ' comes from the verb `` ered '' ( `` arise , originate '' ) , which comes from proto-ugric ( compare : mansi * jeremte * ), 
  wow , that 's really the lowest of the low, 
  translation ? 
  unfortunately not, 
  they dont what ? 
   `` this dude did a lot of bad stuff so literally everything he did was wrong to the core '' nice logic , who is this mp btw ? 
   a generation brought up on polandball i think we should start a campaign to get polandball into high school curricula, 
  gib south tyrol italy yuo are worst latin , remove pasta, 
  what will you tell darth vader when he asks `` why didnt you invest in northern poland ? '', 
  swedish police , what is it doin ? 
  yeah the downtown looks nice . 
  there are commie ass places too , like the kanizsai ltp . 
  surprisingly the sugar factory is not like that , despite that from what i know it 's the only thing hungarians know kaposv\u00e1r for . 
  ( but the smell , goddamn , `` cukorgy\u00e1rszag '' is something you can only know well in kaposv\u00e1r ), 
  i would n't have seen them if there was no wall either , they only go to budapest then to austria ( in a way their rout is similar to actual hungarians ' ), 
  orb\u00e1n is pretty popular , and shit too . 
  exactly like 4chan, 
  bodrog , the village in somogy ? 
  because i know what it looks like , i live like 30min from it by car, 
  yeah , why ? 
  well they did n't visit kaposv\u00e1r . 
  benefits of living in such an isolated town i guess . 
  budapest and szeged are respectively 3 and 5 hours a drive from here . 
  it hardly affected me in the slightest what happened there, 
  its not that i wasnt harmed by terrorists . 
  i did n't even see an actual refugee . 
  if it wasnt for the media i would 've lived peacefully in my isolated ass town without even knowing . 
  nothing . 
  if it wasnt for the media i would n't have even known that there was a crisis going on in western europe, 
  whoops , you 're right . 
  my bad, 
  he is very popular , kinda like pewdiepie , but he is not even the most viewd . 
  clips of kis grof\u00f3 have insane amounts of views for example . . hungary has about 10 million people , if you include hungarians in other countries you have , say 13 million . 
  [ this clip ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w9i6gijkf8&amp;ab_channel=m%c3%a1rks%c3%a1rk%c3%b6zi ) has 20 million views . 
  idk how this is happening but damn . 
  i 'm not even sure if this is the most viewed hungarian video . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gejjcj_7jlw&amp;ab_channel=vide%c3%b3m%c3%a1nia ) 's the review from dancs\u00f3 , i havent seen it either but god damn it looks like shit, 
  hungary, 
  the holy roman definitely was n't . 
  it was more like a federation, 
   austrian you mean hungarian  we 're talking austria-hungary here, 
  you should make polandball comics, 
  damn , nice artwork, 
  are other religions not ? 
  line tool is haram, 
  doesnt matter . 
  i think i done well from memory, 
  it takes a good communist to draw the hammer and sickle in the hands of an eagle, 
  d\u0151\u0171ble lines master race, 
  the `` undecided '' also exceeds fidesz . 
  this title makes it look like everyone in the country supports them , while in reality it 's less than 1/3rd . 
  pepper spray is illegal in hungary , but there are other legal gas-based weapons, 
  we 're 4chan now ? 
  also : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communist_purges_in_serbia_in_1944\u201345, 
   it is inhabitated mostly by ethnic russia . 
  when was that ever a legal argument ? 
   it probably depends on the neighborhood , too . 
  very true . 
  there are the `` everyone knows everyone '' types of neighborhoods ( like villages basically ) , and local pubs there always give out anything to anyone . 
  big shops obviously ask for id cards because they 're assholes . 
  i 'm under 18 right now , i 'm sure how lax people were when you were under 18 , but it does n't take much at all . 
  most bartender just wo n't give a shit , and you can just ask for a random dude 's id card anyway . 
  til puberty is consistent, 
   only illegal thing with alcohol is to sell it to under-18s . 
  that 's the type of illegal like torrenting - nobody actually gives a shit that its illegal, 
  hungary can into liberal . 
  why 'd you steal the karma for the hungarian one from the hungarian redditors ? 
  that 's not fair / s, 
  much less people were actually interested in politics back then though , so less ppl would 've done/said something `` wrong '' . 
  if you think about it , this is worse , because a larger part of the population is affected . 
  ( obviously talking about goulashcommunism here , not the stasi/securitate/kgb terror ones ), 
  k\u00e9tfark\u00fa kutya seems like a viable alternative, 
  i thought they were sunni too, 
  why would i ? 
  name one reason . 
  here 's your mistake : you want to get out after . 
  should 've gotten the fuck out before even going to uni , that 's what i 'm aiming for . 
  flair up, 
  very same over here, 
  why ? 
  i sense a split within the muslim population . 
  could this be the beginning of some sort of schism ? 
  the cognate of el\u00e4v\u00e4 is \u00e9l\u0151 by rule : ' \u0151 ' often comes from earlier ` ev ' so something like \u00e9lev -  \u00e9l\u0151, 
  we are gon na make a bigger one by hand !!! 4 !, 
  ! four, 
  basically the same as football , just swap feet for hands, 
  water polo is popular here too . 
  i remember when the hungarian water polo team beat the us . 
  good times, 
  no , vital does n't mean the same as lively . 
  no , `` eleven '' does n't mean `` alive '' . 
  alive would be ' \u00e9l\u0151 ', 
  the word you 're looking for is `` lively '' , not `` vital '', 
  someone is shadowbanned here,
