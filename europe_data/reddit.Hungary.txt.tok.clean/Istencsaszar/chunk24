  finally , news about somebody being productive , and contributing to the world . 
  found donald trump, 
  dirty germanic loanword too though, 
  why ? 
  it has a special place in modern european culture , unlike longobard ( ancient greek is kinda so-so ), 
  \u00c1llam means ` state ' , it is from the verb ' \u00e1ll , \u00e1llni ' via analogy from latin stare/statum . 
  polg\u00e1r means something like ` commoner , civilian ' , comes from german b\u00fcrger ultimately, 
  yes it is . 
  it 's not spoken anymore , but how would that disqualify it from being a european language ? 
  they put it there because its a european language, 
  that 's gon na be one where every language is sorta similar , then you got hungarian ( \u00e1llampolg\u00e1r ), 
  i wouldnt call soviet blocks a nice view, 
  personal union , yeah . 
  why ? 
  right next to it : royal hungary , literally protecting austria and the rest of europe with its body ... 
  siege of belgrade , siege of eger , etc. 
  nagy imre best communist remove khrushchev yuo are stink stalinist, 
  i know the difference . 
  i just dont understand why these words would be different . 
  ohh , well i misunderstood your comment . 
  yes it is the same thing . 
  it was so much the same that there were people who actually wanted the habsburgs back . 
  the official name was the same ( magyar kir\u00e1lys\u00e1g ) . 
  the official claims were the same . 
  the official language was the same . 
  it losing its minorities doesnt make it a different entity . 
  its like saying czechoslovakia post-munich agreement is a fundamentally different state from the czechoslovakia before it . 
  are you hungarian too ? 
  just asking because your flair does n't give it away at all . 
  yup , that 's what i heard about czech and slovak too . 
  this is so bullshit though , i mean it was literally the same entity pre-1918 and post-1920 , it 's been restored, 
  yes , but the reason for that is that they used these two terms back in the day to de-legitimize the hungarian claims to uhry 's lands . 
  because in hungarian , both are the exact same thing , the kingdom used the exact same name as the pre-1918 kingdom . 
  atleast that 's what i heard , i mean why else would they call the same thing something different ? 
  really ? 
  that 's sweet  is this so in the whole of ukraine ? 
  yeah , it 's grouped into the same language to match certain people 's world view . 
  40 years ago ukrainian and rusyn would both be called `` russian '' . 
  this is something that is unique to bp . . 
  i think i 've only seen a traffic jam in my hometown ( kaposv\u00e1r ) once in my lifetime . 
  budapest , on the other hand ... ` tis a silly place, 
  and romanians also say `` maghiari '', 
   considering rusyn the same as ukrainian, 
  i 'm so glad i dont live in budapest , dude , that sounds like fucking torture, 
  no , it says it 's the 2016th day of the 18th month . 
  ca n't you read ? 
  lol if they dont like the laws they can fuck right off, 
   i 'd kill to be able to drive 100-120 km/h in normal city streets why the fuck would you want to go that fast anyway ? 
  aside from slovakia , croatia , czechia and serbia , and arabs, 
  i think the reason czechs use ma\u010far and not hungarian ( uhersky i think ) , is because slovaks liked to stylize themselves as uhersky , but not ma\u010far ( this needs confirmation from actual slovaks though ) , and secondly to de-legitimize hungary 's claims to the hungarian-populated areas . 
  the reason could be the same for the yugos . 
  in hungary the two are the same ( `` magyar kir\u00e1lys\u00e1g '' , both from 1001-1918 and 1921-1944 ), 
  yes, 
  how could i forget ? 
  tankcsapda 's best song is mennyorsz\u00e1g tourist though, 
  yes , i suppose you do n't automatically recognize given names like `` zolt\u00e1n '' , `` zsolt '' , '' \u00c1rp\u00e1d '' , `` r\u00e9ka '' , `` emese '' , `` g\u00e9za '' , `` enik\u0151 '' , `` dalma '' either . 
  maybe not even `` attila '' ? 
   now i know bad words in yet another language tbf you probably already knew ` kurva ' anyway . 
  ohh , haha . 
  i never thought of that before . 
  i mean i can always tell which one is which for a foreigner , because they kinda always have the same groups of names , but hungarians have some weird names . 
  not to mention that some people have family names that are given names too , which is delightful . 
  yes , the most notable thing about cluj is nokia . 
  i mean what else ever happened there , amirite ? 
  skin color does n't define diversity though . 
  my town for example , has a few blacks but they are not in any way different to the rest of the hungarians culturally , so the only thing i 'd count into diversity is gypsies . 
  ** debrecen , hungary ** : it 's about 1/10th in size compared to budapest , so it 's kind of only relevant in its own region . 
  history-wise it 's a large center of ~ ~ heretics ~ ~ protestants , with the most famous reformed church , it 's also called the `` calvinist rome '' . 
  it also was the temporary seat of the government during the 1848-49 revolutionary war , basically the de facto capital . 
  yeah i know , the main point was the name order because surname-firstname masterrace , and i know romania used to have it too , so i dont think it is that big of a hassle to reverse the order for ethnic hungarians, 
  idk fam i live in a smaller city , not in poland but in hungary , and i never felt unsafe at night, 
  i suppose the different cultures are much more isolated from each other in the uk or brazil . 
  romania is truly multicultural , as in , the different ethnicities live intermixed , no ? 
  oh , the beauty of the hungarian language : not even obvious loanwords are obvious :p anyway , these are mostly austrian german words , like speis  sp\u00e1jz ( food storage place , i believe germans use `` speisekammer '' ) ; beisser/paisser  pajszer ( metal stick ) ; punze  punci ( vagina ) ; semmel  zsemle/zs \u00f6mle ( = br\u00f6tchen , idk what its called in english ) ; sack  zs\u00e1k, 
  wait , so its incorrect if it 's not the exact same as the one you use yourselves ? 
  oh damn , now i know that almost every european country has the incorrect name for hungary . 
  repeat after me : fe-h\u00e9r-o-ro-szor-sz\u00e1g . 
  see , easy ? 
   best subreddit discovery since ~ ~ / r/fellowkids ~ ~ / r/slicedbread . 
  ftfy, 
  im fairly sure , after browsing through some of those kalmyk articles , that nutg means kingdom , and the - din is just some suffix . 
  so they did n't really translate anything, 
   wikipedia be like :  the richest ethnic hungarian suck it cs\u00e1nyi s\u00e1ndor ^ ^ ^ ^ also , ^ ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ ^ tesz\u00e1ri ^ ^ ^ ^ zolt\u00e1n, 
  he was a hun , not hungarian . 
  the reason we are called similarly is that we were just as feared and majestic as he was , if not more :p, 
  that isnt true either . 
  vlach comes from a germanic word which meant foreigner , not just a speaker of romance languages and especially not `` roman '' . 
  welsh, 
  even the ottoman empire was just called `` t\u00f6r\u00f6k birodalom '' , literally turkish empire, 
  because its loaned from german and pronounced identically, 
  vlach doesnt mean roman , it means romanian , yo, 
  25 cases actually . 
  and it would be even more if certain things werent spelled as two words . 
  im espacially enraged by `` xy mellett '' . 
  that could be written as one word like , `` xyn\u00e1l '' . 
  these are used the exact same way . 
  theres also certain cities : breslau/wroclaw is called boroszl\u00f3 . 
  and baszkf\u00f6ld, 
  yes , and for example italian monks made our writing system the way it is ( gy , s , sz are that way because of them ), 
  damn romanians always up to shady ass business in transylvania,
