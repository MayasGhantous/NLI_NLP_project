  yeah , if you mean mainly punishment and very minimal goodies . 
  heh , not much goodies did they get , especially compared to hungary :p hungary hardly played along , the reason they got rewarded is because they posed an actual existential threat to austria , cf. 
  1848-49 independence war , which austria was about to lose , up until russia was called in for help . 
  and from austria 's perspective it made sense them co-equal , because they had huge military strength , plus this way they they eliminated the thread to their rule . 
  hungary did n't exist as an entity before the formation of the ah empire , and one of the big reasons why austria made it a thing is to help oppressing those minorities , thereby sharing it with us , and getting rid of one of the rebbelious minorities , that is hungarians, 
  btw , what is slavonia ( region of croatia ) in czech ? 
  just curious, 
  from the little i know , it was france who proposed it . 
  confoederatio has no 'n' at the end in latin :p, 
  yes , it means `` country '' on it 's own . 
   promote independent thinking that is a dead concept from its inception . 
  you cant just tell society to open up their minds collectively , because its never ever going to happen , not even at a small scale . 
  people will mind their own business . 
  do you even [ coat of arms ] ( http://payload.cargocollective.com/1/4/143822/1912775/austria-hungaria_transparency_905.png ) bro ? 
  lets be fair though , german is worse . 
  lolz , german speakers in historical hungary are swabians , not austrians . 
  so they rightfully belong to hungary , who managed their diaspora for a milleneum :p ( / s ) sopron even voted for glorious hung\u00e1ria to make sure they dont get into the hands of dirty non-monarchy austria, 
  the danube is danubius in latin though . 
  so it could be `` conf ( o ) ederatio danubiana '', 
  sounds very meh, 
  its the carniola province of austria ( dont worry its autonomou ), 
  sounds catchy if you ask me . 
  cant wait to chant `` ahubom-sigacro '' at football matches . 
  no i mean i like the way they look . 
  because you are a dirty czech imperialist , thats why . 
  :p slovaks belong to hungarians , they share our history , our blood and our religion . 
  what about austria-hungaroslovakia-bohemia-galicia-croatia ? 
  as i said , it wasnt intentional - austria didnt even want to make hungary a partner , it only did because of necessity . 
  i am not praising its minority policy , nor its democracy ( although within the hungarian part there were elections and a prime minister and different parties , not sure about austria ) . 
  what i am praising is the dual system , wherein the countries , while basically both independent from each other on internal affairs , maintained a common foreign policy and military , which made it more than the sum of its parts . 
  the closest thing i can compare it to is the uk with its constituent countries . 
  yes , though this diversity is n't a thing anymore . 
  shame on the 20th century . 
  though that area ( k\u00e1rp\u00e1talja / zakarpattia / < many other names  ) has messy history itself . 
  it has been part of austria-hungary , hungarian soviet republic , czechoslovakia , hungary again , ussr and ukraine in less than 100 years . 
  pleasant for the locals , as you may have guessed . 
  my ancestors were deported from there too, 
  good point . 
  i consider austria-hungary a big thing in history because its the first time in modern history where two big nationstates cooperated for their common good . 
  even though it was mainly to make austria more effective at oppressing minorities , the dual empire itself and especially the danubian federation concept can - in some ways - be thought of as the first step towards multi-national federalism ( which the eu-federalist in me admires ), 
  yes , though vojvodina is n't even the most ridiculous . 
  the one i remember for notoriously many names is nagysz\u0151l\u0151s in ukraine , which is nagysz\u0151l\u0151s / syvlyush ( c\u0438\u0432\u043b\u044e\u0448 ) / vynohradiv ( \u0412\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0456\u0432 ) / vynogradov ( \u0412\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432 ) / seleu\u015fu mare/seylesh ( \u05e1\u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05e9 ) / vinohradov/ve \u013ek\u00e1 sevlju\u0161 / wynohradiw , in hungarian , rusyn , ukrainian , russian , romanian , yiddish , slovak , czech and german . 
  oh i almost forgot !, 
  belgrade is n\u00e1ndorfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r , rightful magyar clay . . 
  oh , thanks for reminding me , they can have syrmia too :p, 
   shhh not here . 
  austria-hungary is mecca to ~ ~ r/europe ~ ~ the first world ftfy, 
  well i guess comparing vienna to a woman makes sense . 
  but i thought it was [ europe who was a beatiful woman ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9hs0f9dhjs&amp;ab_channel=kopasz61 ), 
  they 're good at skiing instead . 
  the only true wintersport, 
  yes , that 's the spirit :d magyarization should n't have applied to croatia-slavonia in the first place , i mean what was the point of 1868 then . 
  ( but murak\u00f6z and baranya are still rightfully magyar :p ) . 
  you guys can have croatia-slavonia , dalmatia and bosnia , we get the rest . 
  i mean thats how it was for a milleneum, 
  but ... but ... 
  i was hoping to become an austro-hungarian citizen . 
  how is that you ca n't even grant citizenship to your literal most important territory ? 
  ok , you started this game , i 'm warning you , hungary is the king of rightful clays . 
   having been to murak\u00f6z , can confirm . 
  rightful magyar clay . 
   having been to baranyai-h\u00e1romsz\u00f6g , can confirm . 
  rightful magyar clay . 
   having been to szlav\u00f3nia , can confirm . 
  rightful magyar clay . 
  also , they are our `` brothers in law '' :p ninja edit : also habsburgs  orb\u00e1n, 
  having been to burgenland , can confirm . 
  rightful magyar clay . 
  same opinion here . 
  still does n't let me watch it without turning off adblock, 
  but we already have gyro , is n't that enough ? 
  am i the only one who thinks these cars actually look good ? 
  can someone post the article ? 
   culture, 
  this literally looks like pre-civilization society, 
  on the last pic , the flag of bosnia is upside down \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
   on that note , can you imagine what goes on with the few refugee women traveling with these animals ? 
  i suppose the same that would go on with them back home . 
  how is anyone 's violent death not a tragedy ( except maybe hitler 's ), 
   where can i get one ? 
  the sidebar -------- , 
  thats ridiculously little compared to the trauma he most likely caused for his victim, 
  how the fuck was he not in jail then ? 
  if i was arrested for sex assault two years ago i would most definitely rot in jail , and so should anyone else, 
  this is what communism does to people, 
  tbh no one cares if people watch this type of entertainment - its better than if they watch propaganda, 
  more like : - russia = good - everything that does n't suck its dick = bad, 
  now this is something i would n't have expected from the hungarian film industry . 
  amazing job !, 
  poor dogs . 
  im sure my dog would be a great artist, 
  so fuck eastern europe because if someone goes to the west they give them money ? 
  flawless logic there brah . 
  maybe if you dont want your money to go to eastern europeans , stop paying them . 
   has a culture of no solidarity yes because the west has . 
  lmao, 
  because you are totally not being racist right now, 
  thank you for enlightening us mr. \u00dcbermensch . 
  rekt, 
  eh , what this means is that you guys are traditionally catholic , not that there anyone who actually gives a fuck about religion,
