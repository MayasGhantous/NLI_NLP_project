  i smell a new meme showing up in the corner of my eye ... ^ ( ... angering moscow ), 
  putin relocates capital to st. petersburg , angering moscow, 
  well that is the case in hungary too . 
  2x2 m , no windows , one bed , haram food given them everyday . 
  yep , there 's always some choir with kids singing on tv right after midnight ( and then the president talks but who gives a shit about him ), 
  hungarian would be quicker to just go ` bu\u00e9k ' , everyone says that irl :p, 
  i thought germans preferred to anschluss the beaches in spain, 
  and water will be wet , too, 
  they know how to have fun , eh, 
  i 'd rather blow those up who take our freedom . 
   ecologes ekloga in the original :p we only learned about 7th one in school . 
  though i think nem tudhatom is much better than the ecologes , though it 's also the hardest to translate well ( i read some translations but they do n't really carry the meaning through ) . 
  man , radn\u00f3ti is my favorite poet, 
  yes it does . 
  personal pronouns are ' \u00e9n ' ` te ' ' \u0151 ' , ` mi ' ` ti ' ' \u0151k ' . 
  ( i , you , he/she , we , you guys , they ) . 
  though they 're much much less common than in english , as the person is usually indicated by suffixes on verbs , for example ` esz ** ek ** ' ( ** i ** am eating ), 
  yeah but who the fuck thinks about one 's gender when talking about them ? 
  i do n't , that 's why i ( and lots of other hungarians ) mess up he and she all the time . 
  everyone knows the rules , that 's like the first thing you learn in english class , but it 's not intuitive at all to remember it every single time, 
  kudos for the author for including occitan . 
  not kudos for underrepresenting hungarian in southern slovakia and romania . 
  well , i know that feel , though in this particular one we are n't, 
  same with the hungarian-croatian border , actually , except here there 's no dispute , both sides say the old path of the drava river is the border , but that is really inconvenient for certain places , like , say , [ kri\u017enica , croatia ] ( https://www.google.hu/maps/place/kri%c5%benica,+croatia/@45.973932,17.314321,10599m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4767dcb0f55aea27:0x1ec3088e0bf6c72c!6m1!1e1?hl=en ), 
   cross not offset to the left sorry , not scandinavian enough, 
  its just natural for us . 
  but for example my mind can not comprehend how you constantly remeber everyones gender if you talk about them ( to use he and she correctly ) . 
  it ca n't be that i was the only one thinking `` hung parliament '' must be `` hungarian parliament '' . . 
  you mean on vkontakte, 
   pretty common in ~ ~ romance ~ ~ ie languages though, 
  the names , no . 
  these are latin names used mostly in linguistic jargon . 
  in the school we simply learn these as ` suffixes ' ( ragok ) , and only a few as cases with names , namely the accusative ( t\u00e1rgyeset ) , the dative ( r\u00e9szes eset ) and the genitive ( birtokos eset ) . 
  this is i think because these are the ones present in german . 
  the possessives ( h\u00e1bor\u00fam , - d , - ja / - je , - nk , - juk / - j\u00fck , - im , - id , - jai / - jei , - ink , - itok / - itek , - jaik / - jeik ) can actually be combined with almost every other case , [ making a number of other cases ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ync99/the_word_for_war_in_different_european_languages/cyf5vez ), 
   masculine and feminine that is , ugh , unnecessary , and to top it off , not compatible with the modern interpretations of gender . 
  to be fair , most bus drivers * are * proto-humans . 
  i would n't even be surprised if they found dinosaur fossils in hungarian buses, 
  ^ indo-european languages in a nutshell, 
  edit : nope , there 's more : ** h\u00e1bor\u00fa\u00e9 ** , ** h\u00e1bor\u00fa\u00e9i **, 
  but it definitely makes sense right now . 
  how do you even live in such a crowded place, 
  hungary had it worse in 1946, 
  more like a realist eastern european . 
  i 'm gon na have to say , being striped is n't that bad . 
  gay couples get basically the same benefits , it 's just not * called * marriage, 
  * every * type of paprika, 
  and those who say eastern know geopolitics . 
  which is much more valuable info in a casual conversation . 
  you say you 're from central europe says nothing about you , compared to if you say you 're from eastern europe . 
  mmsz is literally wizards . 
  noone else knew that before, 
  then leave out the part that induces your allergy . 
  and eat double from the other 3 things . 
  no , it 's eastern europe . 
  those who claim they 're from `` central '' not `` eastern '' europe are only doing that to make themselves and their countries look better . 
  same in hungary , except you get : leves ( soup ) , at least 4 types of meat , with atleast 4 types of garnish , then at least 6-8 types of dessert . 
  obviously you 're expected to try everything at least once . 
  sitting on cold benches . 
  it 's a big no-no here , especially for girls . 
  everyone will tell you that you 're gon na go infertile if you do that . 
  the other thing foreigners do n't get is that for lunch , you 're gon na ** have to ** eat as much as you can , if you 're at somebody 's house . 
  `` i 'm on a diet '' is not a excuse, 
   implying that there is any, 
   must not be trusted i for one sure as hell would choose the eu over hungary when it comes to trustworthyness, 
  dont forget bulgaria, 
   was n't fun being a hungarian in the past ~ ~ half year ~ ~ 500 years or so . 
  ftfy :p ( / s ), 
  of course he is . 
  what would he say to his children when they ask about it otherwise ? 
  did n't orb\u00e1n say the exact same thing a few months ago ? 
  sure , but budapest is the exception , not the rule . 
  in the rest of hungary it 's rare to see a non-hungarian license plate, 
  yes , exactly , 
  i suppose those are not made by the hungarian state , instead by some local hungarians who actually care about the news quality, 
  well , here santa isnt that new , he brings presents on december 6 , whereas on christmas evening ( 24th ) `` j\u00e9zuska '' ~ little jesus brings presents, 
   duda this is hilarious . 
  that means ` tit ' in hungarian, 
  most people here know that he 's from `` lappf\u00f6ld '' , aka . 
  lappland or s\u00e1pmi . 
  not sure how many recognize that that is a part of finland, 
  like most things made by the hungarian state , it 's utter shit, 
  same over here , but atleast it 's available for free, 
  no , the name has been shortened in hungarian to `` h\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely '', 
  i dont think most people around here even heard of that . 
  the jokes usually revolve around romanians not getting any meat , or no food even . 
  i dont go to budapest that often , i didnt know lol . 
  was that the same time they renamed moszkva t\u00e9r to sz\u00e9ll k\u00e1lm\u00e1n and l\u00e1gym\u00e1nyosi to r\u00e1k\u00f3czi ? 
  whats that ? 
  this was posted to / r/hungary by a slovak guy , i just found it funny . 
  yes , yes , but the previous commenter made it out like banana was somethibg unknown , but in reality you didnt even have to go far to obtain it, 
   o n't think that there is another example in the world of a street ( let alone main throughfare in the capital ) being named after a living us president there is a roosevelt square in budapest, 
  they are doing that to get fidesz votes . 
  we 'll see how far right they really are if they get elected ( though if they do get elected , i 'm emigrating ), 
  my parents said they could get banana during communism if you were friends with the guy who sold them, 
  damn , that hit hard, 
  hungarians on 4chan are [ fun ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ocj1azr.png ), 
  i heard this one with a sz\u00e9kely / szekler , who says he 's not willing to risk a romanian . 
  ( damn slovaks , stealing our jokes too ), 
  no , that would be `` nem \u00e9rtem '',
