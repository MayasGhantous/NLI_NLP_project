   also most ~ ~ romanians ~ ~ people see putin 's russia as the soviet union 's succesor . 
  ftfy, 
  romanians who live in hungary ( in gyula , battonya etc. ), 
  can have dual citizenship too, 
  well , you can occasionally the `` hardcore jobbik '' guys , who always wear all black with a turul or/and pre-trianon maps . 
  those are the core voters of jobbik , but there 's a big bunch of people who vote jobbik because they dont like orb\u00e1n and want something different . 
  and as sad as it is , jobbik is one of the main contenders , along with mszp , but mszp is getting less support because they did bad things before, 
  that 's good to hear, 
  regular people do n't have anything against romanians , except the jobbik supporters . 
  and the reason is not the 1919 war , the main reason is the treatment of hungarians under ceausescu , and to an extent today ( tho the situation is considerably better today ) . 
  and for example the backstabbing in ww2 is n't appreciated either , but we do n't like to about hungary in ww2 because holocaust and atrocities, 
  but romania allows dual citizenship , no ? 
  so those who become hungarian citizens too , are still romanian citizens as well , in what ways does it hurt you guys ? 
  subbed, 
  oh , well yeah , that 's understandable, 
   your nationalists are n't really thinking it through thinking was never the strong side of nationalists i highly romanticize the idea of something similar to the 2nd vienna award . 
  in that case , we 'd get , say 1,1 million hungarians and 1,4 romanians . 
  that is much more manageable than the 5 million you mentioned . 
   ( mostly-angry ) romanians to be honest i 'm not as afraid of the romanians as i am that if such a territorial change happened , jobbikfags would go around terrorizing romanians . 
  edit : i did n't downvote you , btw, 
  i 'm sorry , what ? 
  i dont understand what you 're trying to say, 
  we tell the joke so that hungarians understand , and here 5 is the best , 1 is the worst, 
  yeah there are stupid ass people over here, 
  that 's not gon na change , though , what do you guys even expect us to do ? 
  old joke i guess , most jokes about romania originate from the communist era , and mostly it 's about how poor everyone in romania was , like this one : a potato is running out of romania , because the romanians are chasing it because they have nothing else to eat . 
  as he 's running he meets the [ pickszal\u00e1mi ] ( https://www.google.hu/search?q=pickszal%c3%a1mi&amp;rlz=1c1gigm_enhu562hu562&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=799&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjv_bbewpljahubxiwkhfegdtkq_auibigb ) . 
  the potato says `` run , they 're gon na eat you . '' . 
  `` ah , dont worry , they dont know me around here '', 
  i agree with you wholeheartedly , but try telling that to jobbik supporters , for example . 
  sadly most people do n't think like this . 
  jokes on you , the modern hungarian vit\u00e9z husz\u00e1r uses [ bicycles ] ( https://www.google.hu/search?q=biciklis+hadsereg&amp;rlz=1c1gigm_enhu562hu562&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=799&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi02c6ts_ljahxdlswkhqfqcdmq_auibigb ) , because the army is getting more modern, 
  i would n't drink romanian p\u00e1linka either , always drink the authentic stuff ( / s ), 
  because , a large part of romania used to be hungary , and we oppressed them really badly , not to mention atrocities like , say [ \u00d6rd\u00f6gk\u00fat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treznea_massacre ), 
  we cant even win at being the most hated enemy of our most hated enemy . 
  holy shit . 
  i actually saw this one in a hungarian joke collection, 
  slovak child shows his father his grades , they 're all really bad . 
  father says : \\ - son , i understand that math is not your strong side , so it 's ok if you get a 2 . 
  geography too , i know you have a shit teacher . 
  but how did you manage to get a 1 from slovak history , when all you had to learn was 2 lines edit : here 's one more : they ask the same question from 3 computers : an american , a soviet and a romanian ; they ask `` why is there no food ? '', 
  the american one replies : what is `` no '' ? 
  the soviet on replies : what is `` why '' ? 
  the romanian one replies : what is `` food '' ? 
  ------------ one more : \\ - why is there no metro in romania ? 
  \\ - because it would collide with the quality of life, 
  there 's one of those in my hometown too, 
  damn romanians , always copying us ( / s ), 
  i 'm a countryside peasant , never heard of the havanna , what 's up with it ? 
  [ bulib\u00e1r\u00f3 ( ~ party king ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gatx849aaui&amp;ab_channel=pixamusic ), 
  uhm , that is exactly because it ca n't enter into international relations on its own, 
  yeah , not yet . 
  i hope it will happen at some point though, 
  i already is , in a way , we 'd just have to extend the power of the federal government, 
  filthy casual . 
  here 's a 25-story skyscraper : https://www.google.hu/search?q=magash%c3%a1z&amp;rlz=1c1gigm_enhu562hu562&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=799&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiz9awf6o_jahvhxswkhul3d60q_auibigb#imgrc=tcrqrdvdp_basm%3a, 
  yeah , that 's because it 's a small town . 
  [ just walk around ] ( https://www.google.hu/maps/@46.369659,17.779082,3a,75y,5.71h,77.07t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sa_-ingjxw2yqlkmcbqtnia!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ), 
  these days the snow seems to always come late january or february ( sometimes even march ), 
  true , but that 's applicable to any country . 
  i 'm sure for example that budapest has a better average than the rest of hungary - but to measure a whole country 's education you have to take shitty parts into account too . 
  that 's not an argument - you make it out like anyone can access those universities , and that everyone gets an education on that level , which is simply not true , as shown , for example in [ student performance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_student_performance ), 
  as long as we dont give it to turkey its ok, 
  i 'll take this as a compliment ;p, 
   where 's the inquisition ?!, 
  probably on its way to arrest you for heresy :p, 
  it 's called ` banter ', 
  would n't that give a disadvantage to countries with high population ? 
  free membership in the eu, 
  you see , you 'd be doing so much better if you were hungary ( / s ), 
  its ok , you said worse things before :p, 
   someone cut this guy 's head by the way !, 
  what are you , isis ? 
   idols worshippers  catholics lol ok, 
  neighboring slavs . 
  like , say , slovaks . 
  or serbs . 
  over there is n't this mentality like here in eastern europe , you know this ' i will defend every square inch of my country ', 
  * guly\u00e1s :p a ` gyula ' is a town on the hungarian-romanian border, 
  that might be the origin of the hungarian word * p\u00e9l\u00f3 * ( means the same thing ) edit : nvm , actually , it 's not , it [ comes from romani ] ( http://jovonk.info/2014/01/04/beszeljunk-magyarul-cigany-szavak-listaja ), 
  `` fika '' means the stuff that comes out your nose when you have cold in hungarian, 
  but ~ ~ czar ~ ~ babushka putin told me it was dry, 
  ( pls dont injure yourself ), 
  hungarian ` a ' is like in ** awe ** some with a california english accent, 
  czech sounds like slovak , with 100 % more ' \u0159 ', 
  whoops . 
  forgot about the mb-thing , and only remembered that ancient greek [ b ] turned into [ v ] ... embarrassing, 
  while in reality it 's really the opposite, 
  slovak sounds like czech, 
  only neighbors know ( eg . 
  you know , romanian is when every other word ends in - sc or - nt and even the natives struggle to pronounce these . 
  that and it sounds like [ numerakir\u00e1ly ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngme_60nktq&amp;ab_channel=irigyh%c3%93najmirigy ), 
  though spanish lacks the palatal row , ~ ~ and greek lacks [ b ] ~ ~, 
  he 'll have a heart attack when he hears people say `` full \u00fcres '' ( \u00fcres = empty ), 
  sad thing is , there 's no better candidate . . :(, 
  here 's list of related words : http://www.helsinki.fi/~jolaakso/f-h-ety.html . 
  there 's actually quite a few, 
  the hungarian language is precisely made to make sure no one understands it ( especially not the neighboring slavs who understand each other ), 
  no wonder why they granted voting rights to sz\u00e9kelys, 
  heretics do that too .
