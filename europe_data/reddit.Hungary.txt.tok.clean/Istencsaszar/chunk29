  wait , so she 's darth vader 's brother ? 
  i looked it up , there are exactly 9,695 `` aromanians or vlachs '' , so not 10 thousand :p, 
  yes , they are tolerant with all 10 of them, 
  slavenia, 
  star wars spoiler : merkel is luke 's mom, 
  well i did n't wan na pick hungary , so i voted romania because victor removal, 
  same with the hungarian government, 
  i do appreciate that you purposefully did n't draw zakarpattia oblast and thereby agreeing to it returning to its rightful owner, 
  how dare you, 
  dont be so stupid . 
  if he dies he 'll get 72 virgins !, 
  what we should do is give him non halal food during his whole life sentence ( which he should spend in a 2x2m room with no window or bed ), 
  how is your map of switzerland more accurate than your map of hungary, 
   sz\u00e9kely land  not including targu mures, 
  everyone can smell it . 
  its in the air all the time,

  yes . 
  i heard that in certain places near the border it 's mandatory to learn croatian in school ( might be bs though ) , and in my area ( i live pretty close to the border ) there are summer programs for kids to learn croatian . 
  yeah , but if you think about it , it could n't have been built before the austro-hungarian compromise anyway , which was in 1867 . 
  which is very wrong , especially hungarians as a nation are definitely not equivalent to the country, 
   later on the croatian-hungarian settlement happened the parliament building was built in 1896 , for the * millenium * ( the 1000th anniversary of the hungarian settlement of the carpathian basin ) , which was after the settlement ( which is 1868 if i recall correctly ), 
  i do n't think they want to give oral to the 72 virgins , so it 's not like they gon na have access problems due to the beards, 
  that is because croatia was many different regions ( therefore more coats of arms ) , but hungary was one big entity ( sans transylvania ) . 
   kinda vampirish :p well dracula 's prison is about 30km from there, 
  orsz\u00e1gh\u00e1z means `` house of the country '' , not `` house of the nation '', 
  built with austria 's money :p, 
  well , you know , whichever concerns you most, 
  in hungary there 's also `` nem hajt a tat\u00e1r '' - `` the tatars are n't chasing you '' , when telling someone to calm down and do things carefully quick edit : tatar here means [ the mongols ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mongol_invasion_of_europe#invasion_of_the_kingdom_of_hungary ), 
   both russians and europeans eh , russian * are * europeans, 
  here 's a few from bucharest for good measure : [ 1 ] ( http://www.dcstamps.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/cee-romania-austrian-occ-ww1-photo.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( http://media.iwm.org.uk/iwm/medialib/408/media-408868/mid.jpg ) [ 3 ] ( https://romaniadacia.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/bucharest-romania-german-occupation-first-world-war-one-ww11.jpg?w=529&amp;h=372 ), 
  yt comments are actual people though, 
  no communication with outside world allowed + life sentences sounds like a combo to tackle that, 
  that might be because of the balkan wars, 
  part of the kingdom of hungary , one of the constituent countries of the empire , so its not wrong to label it as hungary . 
  the joke also takes place in ww2 , when hungary declared war on the us , against which she has no territorial claims , while being allied to every country against which she did ( romania , slovakia , germany , croatia , serbia ), 
  the spirit lives on, 
  and why did you decide to get dual citizenship ? 
  how do you have dual citizenship if youre romanian ? 
  honest question, 
   also sounds like shit no it does n't . 
  maybe i 'm used to it too much . 
  smith john sounds fine to me as well . 
  i guess it takes the kind of logic which is in hungarian - say it like this : - who is he ? 
  - john . 
  - what john ? 
  - smith john . 
  some nicknames work like this in english too, 
  i did n't know that they used the hungarian name ordering anywhere else in europe . 
  is it common ? 
  oh shit i better upvote, 
  why is the name of `` gergely olosz '' reversed , when `` tanczos barna '' is in the correct order ? 
   french : [ tits ] wait , they actually pronounce a whole written word ? 
  in french ? 
  what ? 
   implying 1kg is enough for a person, 
  what they forgot to calculate is that in hungary after everything someone will insist that you eat more . 
  and you will . 
  and they will insist more . 
  and you 'll eat more . 
  so the whole meal is basically a never ending loop of eating . 
  you ca n't calculate that, 
  you see santa only visits * real * countries ( / s ), 
   we do n't have family names with noun meaning damn that must be boring . 
  i know a girl whose family name means `` tit '' ( no joke ), 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's related to hungarian `` jaj '', 
  yes , there are surnames `` v\u00f6r\u00f6s '' - red ; `` z\u00f6ld '' - green ; `` fekete '' - black ; `` feh\u00e9r '' - white and as i said `` barna '' - brown . 
  there are also given names like `` piros/piroska '' - red , female 's name . 
  i know people who have this name , both as family name and given name :p it 's a pretty common one in hungary, 
  barna is hungarian name , it means `` brown '', 
  * good guy vlad, 
  wtf . 
  putin does n't like anime girls ? 
  it 's not even homosex, 
   not orb\u00e1n oh thank god, 
  no , you misunderstood . 
  in hungary you can get a double 1 if cheating off of someone , or if it 's detected ( the teacher realizes that your answers are the same as your neighbor , for example ) , then both the one cheating , and the one to let the other cheat off of them gets a 1 . 
  good point, 
  idk grading systems are pretty arbitrary . 
  for example in hungary you can get fractional grades : for example a 3/4 ( three fourths ) literally sounds like 0,75 . . in reality it means 3,5, 
  the 5940 can go fuck themselves, 
  can confirm, 
  saint helena . 
  how many people can you fit there though ? 
   in hungary you can pass with 2 ? 
  yes , you get a grade 2 if you score about 35 % ( depends tho , some tests you need 50 % to get a 2 ), 
  wait what ? 
  why do you need so many failing grades ? 
  in hungary grades are 1-5 , with only 1 being a failing grade, 
  where would you deport though ? 
  we do n't have spare siberia like the ussr used to, 
   grade of 6.33 do i remember right that in romania 10 is the best grade and 1 the worst ? 
  true for most christians as well, 
  jobbik fanboys and neonazis in hungary ( and the rest of the hungarian-populated areas ), 
  yes , the czech republic has parts of de jure silesia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_silesia, 
  day 34886 : still no revision, 
  it 's frisia , using the flag of [ `` groep fan auwerk '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frisia#/media/file:all_frisian_flag_scandinavial_model.svg ), 
  hey , atleast there 's one thing the east is better at, 
  yeah , but within the huge 1 piece europe you can change around the borders , it doesnt matter that much, 
  franco-russian alliance . . oh shit it 's ww1 all over again,
