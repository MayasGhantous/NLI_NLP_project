  yeah , obviously , but that 's just an argument for automatization , not nit ... 
  also would need a lot of technicians and stuff ... and some insane computing power , to handle all the input, 
  still need the bureaucracy for the fact checking, 
  this is essentially ubi but it 's worse at the very advantage you 're referring to : still needs a lot of bureaucracy, 
  the point is that it can reach out to people who do n't use the internet or computers whatsoever . 
  this . 
  that said though we would need a state tv to reach out to the older generation and poorer people, 
  not just the gdr flag . 
  every communist country had some sort of agricultural good going around the coat of arms . 
  wheat usually, 
  first we should make the refugees build factories to manufacture shovels, 
  northwest yurop islands ( nyi ) . 
  sounds good, 
  4.5 gbp ? 
  going back to buying the shitty eastern eu wines for about 1 euro per 2 liters . 
  western europe can not into cheap alcohol, 
  v4 : being absolutely non-eastern european since 1991, 
  if we had one the refugees would work in it :p, 
  goddammit this joke does n't get old in a millenium , does it ? 
  except its written with the hebrew alphabet duh, 
  * especially * women, 
  hold my mic , i 'm going in, 
  fair point, 
  thanks putin, 
  orb\u00e1n isnt too good either , he just happens to handle the immigration situation pretty well , i think it surprised a lot of people . 
  mind = blown :d thanks tho , 
  shit 's tough when even romanians got our back lol . 
  thanks btw , 
  haha yeah we all know the church forgave everyone because muh christian values . . yeah no . 
  christians ' actions were based on the old testament as much as the new testament, 
  no , those who call themselves muslims so yeah , they too , but not only them, 
  yeah also we should ban gypsies instead of thinking they can change . 
  flawless logic bro, 
  the people who identify with it . 
  taoism is another example of a not bad religion, 
  til morocco is a monarchy . 
  i feel so stupid that i didnt know that, 
  the old testament is just as holy, 
  rekt, 
  `` church '', 
  that 's what we 're hoping for . 
  that would actually be pretty useful, 
  hahaha resign , the chances of him ever resigning is about the same as putin or kim jong un resigning . 
  anyone in an asylum should be deported if they commit a crime . 
  i mean , ffs , respect the laws . 
  no one articulates that hard irl though , atleast i never hear anyone do that, 
  do you have hangover ? 
  drink more p\u00e1linka , it will be better, 
  is it just me or the way he speaks hungarian is really pretentious ? 
  like , why does n't he speak normally ? 
   was n't drawn up in trianon . 
  that 's partially true , a small section in baranya was drawn in trianon . 
  i think croatians like us a bit because we supported them during the balkan wars . 
  afaik thats why they turned that jelasics statue to point to belgrade not budapest :p, 
  k whatever . 
  that did n't add anything to this debate . 
  my dog brings up better arguments, 
  oh yeah they are of hungarian ethnicity , but they dont live in the country , and as such are not responsible for anything in here . 
  citizenship = / = ethnicity , if you think these are even * similar * , you are the disgrace, 
  sounds cool . 
  hungary could use a [ port ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rijeka ) . 
  hungary is a state . 
  people who live outside of should not get citizenship for ethnicity . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  [ omfg it 's working . 
  the other nemesis is actually slovakia . 
  croatia is pretty chill as far as i know compared to romania & slovakia . 
  so we dont need a passport to go to transylvania . 
  not * really * river , the border goes on the old path of the dr\u00e1va river , not the current . 
  not that it 's relevant for a migrant , but it 's weird nonetheless, 
  remove triatlon you are worst sport . 
  you are the pointless smelly sport , marathon only real sport 490bc best day of my life , phedipies aliv in athens , remove triatlon from olympic you are worst smell sport, 
  that 's not a fucking excuse . 
  he is just as bad , possibly worse , i dont care . 
  he has to go too, 
  that 's actually nice to hear , i did n't know that . 
  was anything gon na ? 
  `` deep historical roots '' is this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/congress_of_visegr%c3%a1d_ ( 1335 ), 
  lmao, 
  georgia probably has lots of isolated villages where people arent that informed about the world, 
  well , in hungary we have villages in hungary which have obscene names like `` her\u00e9d '' - ` your testicles ' ; `` bugyi '' - ` panties ' ; `` porn\u00f3ap\u00e1ti '' - ` porn priest ( ? 
  ) ' , so i dont recall any names particularly funny from other places . 
  probably there are but when you have her\u00e9d and bugyi you dont need anything else to joke about, 
  linguistic coincidences like this happen . 
  like the bihar in india and the bihar on the border of hungary and romania, 
   occupied facepalm, 
  afterall , you cant spell romania without romani, 
  not really , all you need to do on feet is to go close to it ( cant shoot you then ) , climb up , open , throw in molotov cocktail . 
  [ result ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/sz%c3%a9tl%c5%91tt_harckocsi_a_m%c3%b3ricz_zsigmond_k%c3%b6rt%c3%a9ren.jpg ) from the 1956 hungarian revolution . 
  unless you have them en masse ( like 100 or more ) it can be countered, 
  wait , serbia has rightful bulgarian clay ? 
  antitrianon 2118 best year of my lyfe, 
  absolute haram, 
  hungary + polan space rockets, 
  and what are we gon na do with that ? 
  stopping the refugees with fucking tanks ? 
  and tanks arent even effective here . 
   remove kebab , add goulash !, 
  how could anyone disagree amirite ? 
   hungary into itself hungary is fractal,
