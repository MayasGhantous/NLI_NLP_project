  the western part of romania that 's not de jure transylvania ( arad , oradea , satu mare , and their general area . ), 
  talking about flairs , your has a typo in it, 
  because muh nationalism , muh centralized nationstates . 
  in other words , people live in the mid-19th century, 
  partium has quite a few hungarians too, 
  applicable to a region of a country too - hungarians in szeklerland do not have the right to fuck with romanian , and not the other way round either, 
  no , that 's called the `` tyranny of the majority '' which is n't good either, 
  [ fyi ] ( http://www.voxeurop.eu/files/images/article/hungary-diaspora-a.png?1244128431 ), 
  because as we all know , hatred and violence solves anything / s, 
  for some reason nowadays the snow always comes in february or even march, 
  sure , if you have the right attitude to it and the intelligence for it , its ok to read it . 
  but most people are stupid , especially as teenagers . 
  i think we are overestimating the reasoning skills of teenagers . 
  ( in general , im not saying everyone of them is too immature to read it , but a fair chunk ) . 
  and yes , jobbik says hi . 
  do you think the neonazi teenagers who support jobbik would reevaluate their beliefs if they read mein kampf ? 
  i dont think so, 
  i know , but look at all the words ending in - ism . 
  they make up a pretty pattern , except for the word feminism ( in the minds of extreme feminists , it does follow the pattern , for normal feminists it doesnt ) . 
  it would be more sensible to just call it a branch of egalitarianism , which would be much more descriptive of what it stands for , and wouldnt be so confusing for many . 
  much shittier , too though . 
  unless you have a hard on for soviet architecture , you shouldnt go there as a tourist, 
  they should also read mein kampf so they see all the different opinions , amirite, 
  how about not giving them fucking books at all ? 
  ( aside from the occasional old ass literature , i 'm all for sleeping in class , but giving teenagers books about * this * is fucking disgusting ), 
   modern feminism = stalinism you may need to brush up your english bro . 
  he says that giving teenagers books about ideologies = stalinism , and tbh i have to agree with him on that, 
  `` the sultan and the bear : kinky times '', 
  and that , is why you do n't list all forms of anything in finno-ugric languages . 
  similar things happened in hungarian , except much earlier , and there are not many records of it anymore . 
  for example old hungarian * utu rea * ( utu = road , rea/re \u00e1 = onto sth ) -  \u00fatra, 
  except when the suffixes are used on their own , but they are always conjugated for the subject : ** nek ** em , ** nek ** ed , ** nek ** i etc. 
  i wonder how confusing that is for a non-native, 
  i know that feel bro, 
  for jobbik - yes it is antisemite , for the rest , no . 
  jobbik likes to deny the holocaust and basically every atrocity hungary has been part of, 
  mentioning gy\u00f6zike being on the level of pet\u00f6fi is , to say , questionable, 
  because these guys are retards, 
  i 've thought about it too , actually , the danubian federation wouldve been an amazing thing , but it wouldve been dismantled after ww1 anyway . 
  yeah , i dont think anyone was afraid of the revenge of romania or hungary, 
  i was talking about magyarization , but that 's right as well : fighting against hungarians in their war for independence isnt a good point in relations either, 
  i mean the war reparations . 
  they were forgiven for germany because they were judged to be too harsh a penalty . 
  you are now under arrest at the order of ~ ~ sultan ~ ~ president erdogan, 
   hungary is ruled by blatant anti-semites . 
  no , no . 
  hungary has a bit of self-hate from the holocaust ( not nearly as much as germany , but still a little ) , and as such usually is n't against jews, 
  as seen in many town names : oradea - nagy ** v\u00e1rad ** ; sighisoara - seges ** v\u00e1r ** ; hunedoara - hunyad ** v\u00e1ra ** etc, 
  no , hungary is a different country which * happened to * have the same monarch , atleast since 1867 it is, 
  i thought that was a traditional hungarian thing , called the * citera *, 
   i 'm romanian . 
  flair up then  also , i thought the unification of moldva and wallachia was the formation of romania, 
  these people make me sick in my stomach , honestly . 
  they are so radical it 's terrifying , they 'd tell any hungarian ( including myself ) that they 're not hungarian enough . . 
  i 'm glad they were arrested , and hope they get many years in prison, 
  also inspiring ass poems ( pet\u0151fi 2 required ), 
  nothing , they 're just bored ass neonazis, 
  this is not the birthday of romania . . this is the unification with/conquest of transylvania, 
  happy unification day guys ... ^ ( gib ^ northern ^ transylvania ^ / s ), 
   hungarians definitely remember i 'm sorry to tell you this but hungarians remember the day of trianon ( june 4 ) and not the romanian unification day . 
   ruled by the very people we hate this hate stems from the 19th century oppressive hungarian regime , before that this hate did n't really exist . 
   we 've been decent stewards of transylvania cough ceausescu cough ( though i agree with you on it in general , but dont forget the guy ), 
  i expected a picture of horthy . 
  tbh versailles * was * revised . 
  trianon was n't . 
  holy shit hungary is better than france and finland . 
  unexpected, 
  please no budapest !, 
  stop sucking the taxpayer money . 
  instead build motorways or something, 
   implying he doesnt do that already, 
  well , obviously . 
  had one language spread so far in the past it would break up into many smaller languages ; see latin for example, 
  idk where you got that from , overusing national flags is still a pretty rightist thing , no one i know has one in their house, 
  wish i could draw , i got so many ideas - paprika , pre-trianon map on the wall , picture of mr horthy too , \u00c1rp\u00e1d-striped everything , tshirt with a huge turul on it, 
  i 'm afraid that it wo n't be true . 
  `` strong '' with a thick eastern eurooean accent, 
   this is virtually unheard of this exists in my hometown , a whole neighborhood is basically this, 
   the first soviet republic in europe ( hungary ) . 
  it 's not like that thing was anything permanent . 
  yeah , although in the 1990s there was a big inflation ( though in romania it was worse , if i recall correctly ) . 
  still , a permanent solution would be much better . 
  where ? 
  they are going to come back no matter where you put them . 
  well , you know . 
  if you 're gon na introduce a new currency , make it new and shiny :p, 
  tho i suppose it 's much more possible to live out of that in romania than in western countries ( not saying that 100eu is an acceptable wage whatsoever ), 
  `` dae eastern europe is literally a shithole and money doesnt exist lolol western masterrace '', 
  til it 's actually called * leu * in singular . 
  we in hungary refer to it as `` rom\u00e1n lej '' , so i thought it was actually * lei *, 
  as i said : fucked up stuff ( btw i didnt downvote you i dont know why ppl did that here ), 
  thats some pretty fucked up stuff, 
  `` yeah , stop blaming the poor multimillionaire company , they did nothing wrong by avoiding having to give up part of their income for the common good '', 
  t spawn : mosque, 
  \\  hungarian flair, 
  oh , well , you guys took that joke way [ too far . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_trianon ) ^ ( ^ ( please dont kill me i know this was a shit joke ) ), 
   do n't upvote you do n't tell me what to do, 
  kinda applicable to all extreme nationalist groups, 
  i think the beginning of the end for daesh started at this point .
