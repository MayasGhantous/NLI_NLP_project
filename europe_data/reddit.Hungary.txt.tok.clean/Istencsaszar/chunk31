  it feels unusual , thats true . 
  dae eastern europe is literally an african shithole, 
  inb4 first human settlement on mars called `` new visegr\u00e1d '' ( \u00daj-visegr\u00e1d ; nowy vi\u0161ehrad ? ), 
  i think the most applicable row to the current situation is this line : * contre nous de la tyrannie * * l'\u00e9tenderd sanglant est lev\u00e9 * ( against us is the tyranny / the bloody flag has been raised ) ofc this originally meant the french royalist flag but its just as applicable to the isis flag . 
  you can also mention that the west traded away hungary in 1956 for the suez canal . 
  totally not a betrayal, 
  exactly . 
  in elementary school i was taught that hungary is in central europe geograohically , but in eastern europe politically . 
  welcome to the late 2010s , when being eastern european feels good . 
  amazing . 
  it would be nicer if the trains within hungary were good tho , because only budapest gets any love . 
  i know that feel bro, 
  hungary can into space, 
  very true , thanks for pointing this out . 
  europe has gotten a little unaware that a lot of the countries are actually at war already . 
  no , it is n't . 
  i guess it was just a backdrop color of the coat of arms , because the right side with the double cross also has an unexplained red in the background, 
  that 's not true . 
  the flag came about when people put the colors of the coat of arms on a tricolor . 
  these meanings have only been associated with later . 
  flair up so everyone sees where youre from !, 
  from what it seems slovenia is more like it . 
  i mean , you got the mountains , you got the peace , got the quality of life . 
  tbh i 'd like to see the eu as a whole become more and more like switzerland, 
   i would rather not :p, 
  sure , but aside from paks , they could achieve much more if they went for budapest . 
  you mean which cold war borders ? 
   a military presence on the streets of hungarian cities wow , seriously . 
  why would anyone want to bomb rural hungary ? 
  i mean , budapest , sure , that 's a world city , but the rest of the cities are n't gon na get bombed . 
  that 's correct . 
  in german too , kind of - dusche, 
  what ? 
  its a common ~ ~ joke ~ ~ misconception here that romania sans transylvania is literally mordor . 
  i like this one a lot : [ b\u00eblga - szerelmes vagyok ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jco0qk2q8is&amp;ab_channel=1grecords ) it 's also been translated into many languages by the author band : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oeqnbjsino&amp;list=plv7zuam63wbujyr_45psrdjnulc1hjdma&amp;index=1&amp;ab_channel=csuti, 
  kis grof\u00f3 is amazing , i agree with you there, 
  it was only partly their colony under austria-hungary ( oh yeah hungary had colonies too , naples rightful colony clay ), 
  yeah i suppose theyre the translations of each other . 
  vend is basically any natively slovenian speaking who lives in hungary . 
  ( though i dont know if that is based on the current or the pre trianon borders ), 
  they identify as hungarian first . 
  usually those from either of the cumanias say they 're of cuman descent , but i dont think its very common to do so, 
  prekmurci are the vends right ? 
  they assimilated . 
  they lost their language in a few generations , but still are a somewhat distinct subgroup of hungarians . 
  ( similarly to sz\u00e9kelys or cs\u00e1ng\u00f3s in romania ) . 
  the regions kiskuns\u00e1g and nagykuns\u00e1g ( little and great cumania ) are named after them ( cf. 
  the cuman empire never attacked hungary afaik . 
  the only time nomands came into hungary was the mongols, 
  from what we learned sz\u00e9kelys came to the carpathian basin before the rest of the hungarians ( at least it is well documented that they 've been there when the rest arrived in 895 ) , and they 've been tasked with guarding the eastern border of the country . 
  ( which was kinda useless given that almost no other tribe tried to cross the carpathians ) . 
  their history before that is a mystery . 
  bunyevci too , no ? 
  not really , i do n't think there are immigrant sz\u00e9kelys , but there are sz\u00e9kelys natively in hungary . 
  [ here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/szekelys-in-hungary.png ) 's a map of the historic settlement of sz\u00e9kelys . 
  they lived all over the place , there are even sz\u00e9kely cs\u00e1ng\u00f3s . 
  yes it is , in hungarian ia\u015fi is `` j\u00e1szv\u00e1s\u00e1r '' , literally `` j\u00e1sz market '' . 
  they came from that general area . 
  yes i think , i know they used to speak an iranian language , so they 're related to ossetians and alans . 
  the kuns ( cumans in english ) are of turkic origin, 
  of course , cs\u00e1ng\u00f3s are too ( they live in moldva ) , but the original question was about subethnic groups in * my country * . . :p, 
  the pal\u00f3c people living in n\u00f3gr\u00e1d county . 
  they have a strange accent . 
  to a lesser extent j\u00e1sz and kun people are distinct too but they assimilated i think they usually dont keep their heritage as strongly . 
  they came to hungary as nomads from the steppe but they dont speak their languages anymore in the south there are the bunyev\u00e1c people too but they are croats i think edit : there are vends too in the southwest , they are a subgroup of slovenes , and swabians , who are germans ( in hungarian we call all local germans swabians though ), 
  what he means is that it 's impossible to understand what you 're saying in english . . 
  . . `` most countries parliament some '', 
  this doesnt mean they 're going back to the russian sphere of influence eventually , right ? 
  ofc for the preciousssss clay you can come join us ( / s ), 
  sounds like a fitting job for me, 
   here is your british citizenship card brb stealing your jobs, 
  the true fun is when you draw cocks in others ' textbooks while they 're not looking . 
  bonus points if it 's a book from the library and they 'll have to return it so the future generations can use it too, 
  the only way 2 's can look good in writing, 
  oh , the `` middleschool textbook '' way, 
  poor eesti , gets rejected from nordic , gets rejected from eastern europe . . 
  then youre not a true eastern european, 
   < insert any european country  : rampant alcoholism ftfy, 
   implying every other eastern european doesnt, 
  is lie , polan can not the space, 
  happens here in hungary every fucking day too . 
  the best is when the boys go to the girls restroom to do that because the teacher would only check the boys ' . 
  thanks for showing that subreddit , 
  i 'm not even sure if / u/verylateish is even romanian by ethnicity . 
  even if she is , i was obviously not referring to all romanians duh :p, 
  nay , slavs like to drink like hungarians , get things right here, 
  and guly\u00e1s duh . 
  gib back rightful clays, 
  me too thanks #finnougricmasterrace, 
  why ? 
  do you know anyone polish who can into space ? 
  exactly . 
  ` van ' is in turkey , not the netherlands, 
  celtic languages actually have closer ties to italic languages ( as such latin and its derivatives ) than germanic languages, 
  if you become christian your sins get forgiven . 
  theres a huge exploit that will always get you to heaven like this : you just need to convert right before you die, 
  a free trip to the nearest church duh :p, 
  good to know, 
  no i 'm just using the glorious hungarian grammar to express everything efficiently, 
  you 'll burn in hell forever anyway filthy heretic :p,
