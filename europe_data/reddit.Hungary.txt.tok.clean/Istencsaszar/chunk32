  you damned heretic ;p, 
  because hungary is stronk catholic country, 
  nahh , get things right here . 
  in the 17th century royal hungary was a very small part in current western hungary , even if you include the principality of upper hungary and croatia , that does n't include the transylvanian territories , infact transylvania had freedom of religion from like the mid 1500s, 
  i genuinely have no idea what you were talking about . 
  `` forgalomba '' is even more, 
  i do n't think they 're that conservative though . 
  i think it 's mostly because they 've ( mostly ) been isolated from the rest of the hungarians, 
  indeed they are . 
  i do n't know the exact reason for that though, 
  in romania that 's possible , but around here ( somogy county ) catholicism is much much more prevalent . 
  though the farther you go east the more ~ ~ heretics ~ ~ protestants you find . 
   you ( not you ) what, 
  if 40 would be that age i 'd be so pissed . 
  i mean , you 'd be through the important parts of your life by then , what 's the point of knowing this and that * after * that ? 
  yeah us dollars per gallon is totes useful and easily visualizable, 
  metric masterrace, 
  nah they 're cool . 
  i think we took in refugees during the romanian revolution in 1989 already , they can come ( if they speak hungarian and are catholic :p ), 
  i meant romanians as in citizens of romania . 
  i never said anything even close . 
  ( also 40 , wtf ), 
  til china is slavic, 
  i 'm glad romanians are trying to do something against corruption, 
  what will you say when your children ask : why did n't you invest in eastern romania ? 
  problem with honest savages from the woods is that they do n't know how to manipulate masses , to appear good in general . 
  also , * an honest :p, 
  the ie diphthong comes from and earlier long e. . . ( for which it 's common to shift to i , cf. 
  english ` ee ' ` ea ' ), 
  that 's exactly the definition of coming from the same root, 
  what about litvany or litwany ? 
  ( analogous to ital ** y ** and brittan ** y ** ), 
  lithuania comes from the same root as well . 
  okay , anything to make you genuinely believe that hungarians are not in any way related to slavs or part of a slavic substrate . 
  under the soviet system most of eastern europe has been constantly hearing brainwash . 
  i 'm fairly sure most people are a little more resistant to brainwashing therefore ( but as i see the younger generation is much easier to brainwash , which is sad ), 
  as a slovak you might also know that eastern europe has a history with a lot of xenophobia in the recent times ( late 1800s and onwards ), 
  but hungary is n't ? 
  is that because of the german/austrian influence ? 
  our president ( schmitt p\u00e1l ) had a doctor 's degree and his dissertation was basically the translation of some bulgarian author 's work, 
  relevant username, 
  rekt, 
  sounds like `` ew '' when you 're really disgusted, 
  nonono that 's romania, 
  being in middle school my * menza * costs ca . 
  1 $ per meal, 
  i think thats because most people who went to the us went in small groups - one family , for example , would lose connection with its heritage in one generation - the kids of the immigrants get married to locals , their kids will most likely never even speak the language . 
  when a larger community arrived in the us they kept their heritage longer - the irish , sometimes italians , etc. 
  sure , but that 's a different situation . 
  but for example if i was born in romania in a hungarian family , i 'd definitely identify as hungarian , no matter how many people around me were romanians . 
  thanks , 
  on mobile it wants my email address to view the article, 
  its really disturbing that for a person like snowden the only safe place is russia . 
  holy shit . 
  would be useful to the welsh . 
  sure , but the saying goes `` when in rome , do as the romans do '' , not `` become roman yourself '' . . one 's identity should n't be dependent on their surroundings . 
  i mean , even if you spoke russian , you could say you are mari . 
  see the irish in great britain , for example . 
  they spoke english because they had to , but their identity stayed irish, 
  aw :( it 's sad to see the decline of the minorities in russia like that . 
  and how come you consider yourselves russian ? 
  is it because of the environment , education , or what ? 
  they can be educational and historic too though, 
  that 's what she said, 
  so you consider yourself komi ? 
  if so you should ask the mods for a komi flair . 
  also , i wan na ask you , do you speak komi ? 
  hungarian took \u00fc from the finno-ugrics too . 
  the german influence, 
  steppe autonomous okrug, 
   francification you may want to look up vergonha, 
  theres a similar thing in hungary with orb\u00e1nists vs. everyone else, 
  there is a jewish autononous oblast in siberia/manchuria where stalin wanted to deport all jews and there 's still a jewish community living there, 
  i was talking about bukovina , but yeah you 're right, 
  but , how ? 
  once the alarm goes off it 's impossible to sleep . 
  you are , like bound to be awake and chipper, 
  i cant imagine anyone having difficulty with having to start working at 7 ... maybe i 'm just good at waking up early ? 
  romania please sit back . 
  you do n't decide on this ^ fortunately, 
  there 's also the `` declare myself to be romanian/ukrainian because reasons '' thing . 
  is n't it weird that clays always * somehow * become the same majority as the country they 're in ? 
  this is an awful tendency, 
  i do n't have any problems with them either , but i do n't think we should invite serbia and croatia to the same party ... :p, 
  yeah . 
  i think some retard in russia mentioned that if hungary helped russia in the ukrainian conflict , russia would give zakarpattia oblast back to hungary . 
  for jobbik this basically means they love russians now . 
  surinamians are disappointed, 
  oh come on ... hungary is cool too , no ? 
   slovakia , romania , hungary are very good neighbours too it 's not like romania and hungary do n't want your clay too though . . :p, 
  something something gib clay ( jk love you guys ), 
  polayynd . . croayytia ? 
  jobbik 's main profile is not pro-russia , it 's pro-anything-that-would-revise-trianon , and russia would apparently do that ? 
  or , we could simply change work hours an hour back so everyone has more sunny time in the evening . 
  everyone could start working earlier and leave work earlier, 
  literally stalin , actually, 
  it 's like it was specifically * made * to be a place to emigrate to from hungary, 
  oh okay i thought the names derived the other way round : brittany ( bretagne ) and great britain ( grande bretagne ), 
  i 'd vote for that, 
  would n't they be insular brittany though ?
