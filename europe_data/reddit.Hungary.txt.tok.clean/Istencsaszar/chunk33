  it gives you angers ? 
  [ well ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_0x6oadmi&amp;ab_channel=computerphile ), 
  hungarians have that , too :(, 
  wish hungarian had closely related languages . 
  even from the closest related languages from central siberia i cant understand more than a few words, 
  exactly . 
  i think in hungary voting with a + is valid too, 
  agreed, 
  hungary is as eastern european as it gets, 
  for slovaks this is really misleading , that 's true . 
  they were there before , too . 
  thanks for clarification , 
   hungary has been poor always . 
  nah that 's not true . 
  under austria-hungary we were pretty well off . 
  for most of the middle ages we were pretty wealthy too, 
  please do n't . 
  amazing, 
  as far as i know vlach was only an exonym , they called themselves romanians , no ? 
  that 's not true though , nobody is perfectly certain how the modern romanians came to be actually . 
  i 'm still interested of how you think the pre-trianon hungary was never hungarian to begin with, 
  agreed . 
  yeah the refugees were probably the strongly anti-communists, 
  eh , that 's bullshit right there . 
  slovaks and romanians mostly came in after the mongol invasion of 1241-1242 when b\u00e9la iv . 
  invited anyone who could work to account for the population loss , and this practice continued , after the ottoman invasion . 
  as for croatia , it was acquired via marriage/inheritance, 
  like , integrated ? 
  like , natively there since fuck knows like austria ? 
  like ? 
   foreigners not really , for example in austria there were hungarians living there before it as well , i 'm pretty sure there were lots in small numbers in other places too, 
  nagy imre was a communist, 
  still better than the russians tho, 
  stolen clay ? 
  i remembered reading it like a year or 2 ago and just searched for it, 
  actually , in austria-hungary there were actual museum exhibits of samoyeds from the tundra . 
  they were literally in a zoo . 
  `` easy '', 
  that 's actually a real philosophical concern if you think about it . 
  is it moral to give such important choices to the people who might not even have an idea of which will be better for them . 
  ^ ( latin masterrace , muh euro heritage ), 
  i actually had this same idea as well myself . 
  within the eu+s chengen , borders really are nothing more than which country you pay taxes to/who administrates the area . 
  we could just go full bordergore and decide everything with referendums . 
  here it is n't allowed . 
  you can choose german or english as first foreign language , if you chose german your second is automatically english , if you chose english you can choose from german , russian , spanish , italian , french or latin . 
  zvonimir true king of hungary ( and slovakia , bohemia and austria ) orb\u00e1n is pretender , remove, 
  `` nigga '' is n't in hungarian slang either btw . 
  i 'm in middle school ( gymnasium ) right now and it 's mandatory for english to be one of the 2 foreign languages learned here . 
  agreed . 
  i think the confusion in english is that a lot of people use `` nation '' and `` country '' interchangeably, 
  awww , so you want turuls back :d cool , agreed, 
  could n't agree more . 
  ( just dont use the term united states . 
  just keep european union or federal union of europe ), 
   central topkek, 
   please do n't think bad about me why would i ? 
  my thoughts exactly, 
  if so why is my age such a big deal ? 
  18 year olds are two grades above me in middle school, 
  seriously . 
  what were you liek when you were 15/16 ? 
  no problem, 
  ohhh . 
  jerb is redneck american , tru eastern yuropean is job :p . also im 15, 
   c. . . p ? 
  im not yet working age , but i think i will be the `` go to vest and teyk yuor jobs '', 
  this hair is pretty common though, 
  um , yes it did . 
  latin evolved into the currently spoken romance languages , which are its direct descendants . 
  there is no clear point where latin ended or died out , it simply diverged from its regional dialects into dozens of different languages . 
  at no point did latin have a last speaker who was the last to speak it . 
  it never went extinct, 
  its elegant ^ ( in romania hehehe ), 
   run poland if i were poland i 'd take this seriously . 
  i think the jews learned the local language , and the people back when they emigrated told them they spoke latin, 
  hungary also has [ 450-something yrs old one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/p%c3%a9cs#/media/file:p%c3%a9cs_-_mosque_church_01.jpg ) , but it 's been turned into a catholic church i think, 
  he 's always been, 
  it 's not weak it just cant agree on what to do and the countries can cooperate properly . 
  the real problem is the lack of central government, 
  it 's not a dead language , it 's just an older version of currently spoken languages . 
  it never died , because french , italian , spanish etc. 
  * are * latin . 
  they are the same exact thing, 
  [ ladino language exists too ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/judaeo-spanish ), 
  so much truth in there, 
  true virtue from them bashing those who wo n't / ca n't bash them back, 
  jobbik is bad enough in hungary , slovakia should better do something before things go awry, 
  dat iron curtain remnant doe, 
   whats up with germany ex-east germany, 
  luxemburg has its own language though , l\u00ebtzeburgesch, 
  \\ - every austrian , swiss and belgian ever :p, 
  fair point, 
  infact it had the largest amount of consonants for a language excluding click languages . 
  all those consonants topped with exactly 2 vowels, 
  it 's a cool thing . 
  nice to see countries cooperating for once . 
  this was necessary as well, 
  it 's not about competence , it 's about that you guys are not hated by anyone else in the region and are fairly large, 
  it used to be the same here ( complete with the good ol' roaches ) but now we here ( kaposv\u00e1r , cca 70k inhabitants ) build this hi-tech western-looking hospital which looks really good .
