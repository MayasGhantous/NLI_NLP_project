  hungarian is absolute bs i 'd try not to watch it like . . ever, 
  the common border would be in current ukraine if it ever happened to exist . 
  maybe someday you will be . 
  it 's so annoying when i have an intuitive sense to make someone feel bad, 
   you really know how to make a woman sad :( ikr, 
  it * should * be wrong , but it isnt . 
  unfortunately the world revolves around money : /, 
   i rather try that before kissing some ass only for money you say that now , but as they say `` p\u00e9nz besz\u00e9l kutya ugat '' :p, 
  same here : king louis - lajos , charles - k\u00e1roly , james - jakab ( wtf ? 
  this is a name never outside of kings of england lol ) , george - gy\u00f6rgy . 
   you have to first learn the correct name and then keep two separate names in your head for every important monarch even worse for habsburg king numbering . 
  for example `` charles i of austria '' is `` charles iv of hungary '', 
  yeah i 'm aware magyarization was really bad for the minorities of hungary for a long time , though as far as i know croatians were the least affected , romanians in transylvania and slovaks got it even worse . 
  if i recall correctly croatians even had their own autonomous parliament in zagreb and croatian was an official language in croatia-slavonia from 1868 , no ? 
  same in hungary though , jagellion is jagell\u00f3 in hungarian ( ladislaus is l\u00e1szl\u00f3 ) . 
  in hungary we take translating foreign names to a whole new level , with names like `` verne gyula '' ( jules verne ) etc. 
  it 's also for nationalistic sentiments :(, 
  fully agreed, 
   eszter zalan ugh , i hate it when these type of names appear in non-hungarian , because i 've no idea if the journalist is a male or female , because eszter is a female name , zal\u00e1n is male , and i 've no idea which is his given name because the ordering can be western or hungarian too . 
  weird , i never thought this was any more crowded than for example two sicilies . 
  exactly . 
  one could say his two titles were emperor of austria and king of hungary , but the king of hungary also included the kingdom of croatia for historical reasons, 
  fact is hungary didnt dethrone the habsburgs either and i think they actually tried to claim the hungarian throne in 1922 . 
  ( hungary at that time was a `` kingdom which permanently had no king '' ) . 
  thanks for clearing the rest up though we only learn in school that under saint ladislaus 1 hungary acquired croatia and basically the king of hungary was automatically king of croatia too ( btw not unlikely to the austria-hungary system where franz josef and later charles 4 had to be crowned with the hungarian crowning procedure - they had to be crowned in sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r , by the bishop of esztergom , with the holy crown ), 
  if its about 1956 , its probably szabads\u00e1g , szerelem ( freedom and love ) . 
  and yes , probably if romania had a less shitty leader the transition to democracy wouldve been much smoother, 
  no i mean they actually liked the way things worked before 1989 . 
  hungary wasnt really a police state ( or not nearly as much as romania was for example ) . 
  the real scary shit was before 1956 , when there was the \u00c1vo / \u00c1vh , which was the hungarian edition of securitate , and basically oppression of anyone who wasnt a hard on commie . 
  after the revolution we got a different dictator whose motto was `` whoever isnt against us is with us '' , so he left everyone alone except those who were openly anti-communism . 
  and this dude died in 1989 and after his death we just became a republic . 
  so for anyone born after 1956 the system wasnt too bad whatsoever, 
  and it made hungary have a coastline so it was definitely beneficial . 
  too bad nationalism from both sides ruined it, 
  * my * mothers uncle was friends with the local grocery shop owner and so he was able to buy bananas . 
  i agree hungary was spoilt as fuck :p no wonder why there are people who believe communism was good, 
   people used to smuggle cola from hungary or condoms from serbia . 
  and to hungary they smuggled from either the ddr ( i once heard of people who smuggled in an actual trabant from there ) or from austria after you could go to west ( mid-late 80s ), 
  to hungarians it was a place where you could get cheap shit and sell it here . 
  you didnt even have to speak serbian or croatian , in szabadka they spoke hungarian mostly, 
  no , the kingdom of croatia was basically under the kingdom of hungary since the 1100s . 
  basically the king of hungary ( who also happened to be the emperor of austria ) was automatically the king of croatia too ( atleast thats what i remember ), 
   til that he translated the lord of the rings to hungarian !, 
  also he translated while in jail for 1956, 
  well maybe they dont want to give up their thousand year old heritage . 
  if they become atheist they will believe in the same shit anyway . 
   `` why even call yourself christian if you 're willing to distort the holy bible by translating it to a language other than ~ ~ latin ~ ~ hebrew , aramaic and greek ? '', 
  ftfy, 
  hes not from the eastern bloc so he probably didnt lol, 
  dont worry now your kids have glorious magyar genes .

  * nazism in english  the english like to use the original spelling, 
   with seriously violent expansions policies sounds familiar . . 
  sounds like lebensraum, 
  as far as i can tell kaliningrad and k\u00f6nigsberg are kind of interchangeable ( atleast in hungary i hear both ), 
  well the safeguarding didnt work for too long in the early 1500s tho : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_moh%c3%a1cs,
