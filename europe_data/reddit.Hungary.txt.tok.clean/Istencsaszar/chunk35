  thats like , really common, 
  prussia isnt in germany there, 
  well if you mean north hungary as in slovakia , then no , they are from kisv\u00e1rda which is in hungary today, 
  after the civil war would 've been an excellent time . 
  i do n't really see why you 're making this distinction . 
  kek, 
  make the habsburgs great again ? 
  you 're thinking of national identity . 
  nationalism is the political ideology centered around what i just said . 
  to make an easy-to-grasp example : a hungarian in romania who just acknowledges that they 're hungarian is n't a nationalist by definition , someone who actively participates in separatism is .

  they also managed to spend like 50 million forints for this bullshit, 
   [ omega temetkez\u00e9s kisv\u00e1rda ] ( https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43940ba0989c29917a571e4da207123a2b67f470/0_184_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=1920&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=b0f2dc7d890980e4863084c5c8ec7c40 ) totes slovakian, 
   everything that ends on '' - ism '' is a bullshit especially journalism, 
  too bad the right is n't going with them too, 
  i live under a center-right populist, 
  sounds like something fidesz would do over here . 
  nationalism is not that . 
  nationalism is the fetishism of nationstates , as in , thinking that every nation should have one state and that state should only have people of that nation and vice versa . 
  and that everything neatly fits into these boxes , into nation and there are no overlaps ever and it 's all just perfect if you separate everyone like that . 
  that is delusional , and taken to the extreme , it has already been shown many times to be violent and oppressive . 
  this idea is so ingrained in our society that many people ca n't even think outside this box , which is why everyone is screaming `` ohmahgerd theres no european nation '' or `` ohmahgerd theres no european identity '' , but in reality these are n't needed for a european state to happen . 
  i do n't feel close to greeks at all either . 
  hell i do n't feel close to people from the other side of the country , either . 
  i feel close only to people i know personally , but i understand that living in the same country does n't require any particular emotion , it just means the same guy steals your money as theirs . 
  and that could as well be the same with greeks as well for all i care edit : accidentally a word, 
  yeah , i think europe has to realize that one state does n't have to be equal to one nation . 
  you can have many nations in a country , if they are all treated equally ( aka , none of them get privileges or special rights ) , then the concept is even better than the one-nation state . 
  i am personally a huge fan of [ national personal autonomy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_personal_autonomy ) because of this . 
  it would allow for everyone to not just keep their national identity , it would also allow nations that do n't have their own state to create their own thing that is just as important as the other nations of europe . 
  and to add to that , these would n't be territorially restricted like today 's nationstates are , so every person of the nation living in europe could all be members of the national thing , no matter whether they 're in the majority or minority in a place . 
  that was not yesterday . 
  by now something could 've been done about this, 
  post the guillotine made of an avocado an ice-pick and a snorkel first and then we can talk, 
  hopeful the list of countries going full retard too, 
  well no , it does n't . 
  californians dominating everything would be the fair thing . 
  because you know , they are more numerous . 
  come on , / u/charmack90 !, 
  you 're not gon na get a better offer, 
   trump very nearly did . 
  well so did clinton, 
  yeah , similar systems existed for many years in many places , more similar to the uk system today , with the exception that the commoners and serfs werent considered people, 
  its hard to expect a democratic country . 
  i dont expect that , i expect you to not pretend like your country was somehow better for 90 % + of the population . 
  because being serfs or poor peasants sucked just as much in poland as in russia, 
  again , that doesnt help 90 % of the population . 
  much like the us becoming the us didnt help the slaves there . 
  yeah , i can . 
  probably he 'd run out of motivation completely . 
  the uniting factor for fascism was the common enemy , once it 's defeated , the ideology would run out of power and the general public would support him less and less ( especially if the whole genocide thing got really public ) , resulting in either revolution or a slow drift towards a normal dictatorship-oligarchy . 
  in short no , the world would n't have ended, 
  oh wow , democracy for * nobles only * ? 
  must be totally better to be a serf there than in russia , where you were treated the exact same , right ? 
  hey , i mean , that 's better than today 's france or america, 
  how is it better ? 
  pretty sure they would 've stopped after wiping out that race ( or at least would 've become much more lax with the thing ) , stalin was never gon na stop at any point, 
  [ top kek ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf_c4ftwais&amp;ab_channel=kekkats ), 
  was n't poland-lithuania a feudal monarchy ? 
  what did n't the japanese make animes about ? 
   the austria-hungary was falling over no matter what nice meme , [ no it was n't . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/3q56w7/was_austriahungary_in_decline_preww1/ ) a federated monarchy was much more likely to happen, 
  yeah, 
  still though , minimal wage in germany is ridiculously high . 
  i do n't think basic food and hygiene can cost that much , like in any case, 
  i demonstrated a link between religion and barbarism , but yes of course , any ideology taken to the extreme is barbaric, 
   kgb kiks you out the kgb is on kik ? 
  no , i mean permanently . 
  i remember from history class that castles like \u00c9rsek\u00fajv\u00e1r , p\u00e1rk\u00e1ny , f\u00fclek and many others were held by turks, 
  hey , it 's not our fault you guys were mostly serfs and poor peasants . . 
  there 's this new thing called minimal wage , which is a great way to approximate how much you should spend on each inmate . 
  plus the guards ' salary of course . 
  no reason to spend more than that , unless you feel like your criminals deserve a better life than the working class . 
  yes , of course, 
  i do n't care if they win or not . 
  i said i 'll be voting for them , because the major parties deserve jury trials more than a vote, 
  unfortunately the hindi word for food does n't follow a chain . 
  we should start a movement to make the hindi word for food `` engish '' so we come full circle, 
  they see politics as what it is : a joke, 
  it should n't , do n't worry, 
  eh , i do n't think products here would be worse than those in the west, 
  this is cause for war, 
  my apologies then, 
  that 's not what he meant to say . 
  he meant that the ottoman empire oppressed the shit out of turks too, 
  i know of a hungarian yo mama joke from 1490 ... 
  since the principality of transylvania was never subject to as much oppression by the turks as the rest of hungary , that is n't too surprising . 
  there really was only one major genocide around the banat and that general area , which explains arad, 
   old joke  ** old **, 
   intercity ( ic ) not sure if you 're stealing the name from hungary or what, 
   it 's lack of a subway infrastructure ... you know the old joke : why is there no subway in romania ? 
  it would collide with the quality of life, 
  probably still less expensive than western european prisons , atleast according to what i heard about them, 
  there 's the k\u00e9tfark\u00fa kutya though . 
  i 'm really considering voting for them, 
  yup . 
  iberia is known to be full of ultra-catholics ( no offense to iberians btw , just a stereotype ), 
   me on every `` oh look beautiful region '' post, 
   for the serbs serbs had nothing to do with the creation of this symbol though . 
  maria theresa and the hungarian authorities are the ones who did this,
