  hungary can into space too nao . 
  hungary can into stronk, 
  * remove * trianon ? 
  i hear this from non-hungarians but i think you 're talking about * revising * it ? 
  just like everyone here ( trianon-rev\u00edzi\u00f3 in hungarian ), 
  how ? 
  strange times are ahead of us, 
  who was the guy who laid her ? 
  he shall now have my eternal respect, 
  ever tried to illegally cross through mountain peaks which are also guarded ? 
  well , fair point . 
  i still think it would be easier if we put the wall in the mountains, 
  same shit is in the bible , yet you dont see anyone christian bothering it . 
  the point would to bring islam through the stuff christianity went through during the enlightenment, 
  would actually make sense . 
  dont get me wrong , i 'm not any sort of revise trianon bs , but stopping them in the mountains would be easier than on the border . 
  just sayin . 
  some cooperation would be nice edit : why the downvotes ? 
  is this really such a bad idea ? 
  support these stuff for example : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberal_muslim_movements, 
  jews and christians are generally enlightened and accept that religion and the actual world are not the same . 
  we have developed european values and follow those above our religious beliefs . 
  the problem is that theres a bunch of folks who dont do this . 
  that is what we want to spread amongst the migrants, 
  maybe ... 
  that 's an insult, 
  still better than romania :p, 
  i think mostly alchemy ( chemistry ) and algebra, 
  here 's a scotsman joke just for you then :  the french , the german and the scot are drinking beer in a bar . 
  suddenly a fly flies in their glasses . 
   the french throws the beer away and orders a new one  the german throws the fly away and drinks the rest of his beer . 
   the scot grabs the fly , shakes it in the air and shouts at it : `` spit it out now '', 
  * she is moskal , no ? 
  rekt, 
  sure , we mixed with them a lot ( rape adds dna from the victims too duh ) , but we did so with mongols , turks and germans , and the process went both ways . 
  i dont think hungarians are more slavs than the other way round . 
  yes , yours still live , ours dont . 
  simply because the culture we took was more from germans and italians than slavs . 
  dont get me wrong , we took a lot from slavs too , but saying we assimilated into being slavs simply isnt true, 
  though after that wall is built they will go through slavonia :p, 
  thats fine , everyone knows this , but being `` assimilated by slavs '' is ridiculous . 
  pagan rituals were common in hungary up to about 1100 , while the surrounding slavic people were christians . 
  why would we have had kings named `` b\u00e9la '' and `` g\u00e9za '' , traditional hungarian names of pagan origin , if we were assimilated by slavs ? 
  we realized ourselves that we were gon na be rekt if we dont assimilate into europe , and we did it pretty damn well . 
  croatian kingdom ? 
  that was gone way before the ottomans, 
  the battle of augsburg , you mean ( 955 ) ? 
  by that time we raped & pillaged our way across all of europe up to andalusia . 
  it 's more like slavs are hungarians in denial, 
  yeah like 1/4 gypsy or something . 
  also he is calvinist not catholic so he 's apparently a religious minority . 
  by religious minority we mean if he goes to church he goes to the other church , not the main one ( catholic ), 
  more like `` he apparently has a positive side '', 
  [ muh trianon revisions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarians_in_slovakia ) . 
  [ pls eu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slovakization ), 
  i do n't know about that either . 
  probably it was without greek influence , who knows, 
  pie stop + semivowel turning into stop + stop . 
  i think in greek the stop is alveolar because it was a palatal semivowel j  t , in armenian the stop 's velar because it came from the velar semivowel so w  g. voicing matches the other consonant 's voicing, 
  * j was not a consonant in pie , it was a semivowel , just like * w. 
  i did n't list two possibilities, 
  you cant be serious . 
  old norse , gothic and proto-west-germanic are all descended from pg . 
  there was proto-baltic too most likely , but probably not for long at all . 
  it 's possible that the west and east baltic families are both directly from proto-balto slavic, 
  there is : * dw -  * dg -  * tk -  * rk -  erk - . 
  * dw - to * dg - also could be from some influence from greek where * pj -  pt - happened for example . 
  edit : accidentally a word, 
  exactly !, 
  unnecessary random vowels . 
  who needs ` nil ** a ** ' when you can have ` ny\u00edl ' ? 
  who needs ` nuol ** e ** ' when you can have ` ny\u00e1l ' ? 
  geez finns , get on our level, 
  in hungarian too , it 's spelt ` kaka ' though . 
  thanks , 
  really ? 
  can you give me a source ? 
  national identities come and go , slavic macedonian happens to be a new one . 
  does n't mean it has less legitimacy than greek macedonian to the name, 
  no one wants to give them ownership of the macedonian identity , let alone `` sole '' ownership . 
  just because they call themselves macedonian does n't mean you ca n't do so as well . 
  no one owns national identities, 
  well that 's true unfortunately . 
  i think macedonia is appropriate too , but in a different way . 
  macedonia can be interpreted as ` the land of the macedonian people ' , and if they pushed that interpretation that would be better , right ? 
  instead of ` republic of macedonia ' ( republika makedonija ) they could call the country ` macedonian republic ' ( republika makedonciya ) . 
  would that be better in your opinion ? 
  as i already said in a different comment , there are two ways the name macedonia can be interpreted : one is the name of the region that spans both fyrom and greece , which interpretation is why greeks dont like this . 
  but the other interpretation is ` the land of the [ slavic ] macedonian people ' , which would be much better , but unfortunately both sides seem to think the first one is the true one . 
  if the official name implied the second interpretation it would be much better ( ` macedonian republic ' instead of ` republic of macedonia ' ), 
  i think the ancient macedonians would 've called themselves greek if they were that , just the fact that they spoke the same language does n't mean they were greek . 
  they spoke greek though , which means they were definitely closely linked to the greeks . 
  this is also irrelevant from today 's perspective . 
  i believe that every nation has the right to call themselves whatever they want . 
  as do the macedonians ( even if they 're slavic . 
  i think the fact that they live in a region called macedonia is enough justification to do so as well ) . 
  now even if you dont agree with , we both know that there is a nation which calls themselves that , so it doesnt matter . 
  now , here 's the confusion : the name of the current republic ` macedonia ' can be interpreted two ways : one is the one-to-one correspondence with the greek region name ` macedonia/makedonia ' . 
  this is the interpretation of the greeks who are upset about this , and unfortunately the macedonian politicians seem to favor this interpretation too . 
  the other is the way i interpret it : it is derived back from the nation 's name , ` macedonian ' , and hence it carries the meaning ` the land of the [ slavic ] macedonians ' .
