  yeah , it 's totally religion that 's responsible for reproduction , right ? 
  most definitely not sex , am i right ? 
  belgium works too . 
  what matters is how gullible the people are to the demagogues who spread the hate, 
  probably tankcsapda, 
   and every operation should be approved by all participating nations . 
  so basically , make it so that it will never be useful . 
  is n't the point of the eu army to make from the bunch of useless armies , an army that actually is useful ? 
  does n't it have to be hateful to be racist ? 
  jokes can literally not be racist, 
   however when it comes to eu voting everyone 's dick is the same size not true . 
  everything can be vetoed by the ep , where not everyones dick is the same, 
  `` my dick is larger than 19 ant dicks put together '', 
  \\  ** nordic ** girl42 \\  estonia flair, 
  / r/outside could help you out on that, 
  you think bosnia just conquered itself ? 
  the hungarian army after that did n't win battles either ( not a single one since 1919 ) , that does n't mean it was n't functioning, 
  who knows ? 
  we all know that once people started doing censuses , germans were the majority . 
  before that , nobody knows because nobody cared, 
   multi-culturalism has n't worked yet switzerland, 
   the adorable replies . 
  :p and the downvotes :p, 
  seems like sarcasm is n't carried over well in text today, 
  it 's just friendly banter , man, 
  there 's also a ' :p ' in there . . 
  please do n't tell me you actually thought i was serious, 
  googling the meaning of a different word is n't a very good argument . 
  check this shit out :  terrorism - the unlawful use of violence and intimidation , ** especially against civilians ** , in the pursuit of political aims . 
  \\ - oxford  a form of psychological manipulation through warfare to the purpose of political or religious gains , by means of deliberately creating a climate of fear amongst the inhabitants of a specific geographical region . 
  \\ - wiktionary  the use of violent acts to frighten the people in an area as a way of trying to achieve a political goal \\ - merriam webster, 
   plotting to assasinate main opposition party leader that one is n't terrorism tho imho . 
  terrorism is when it 's directed at civilians, 
  yeah , for half a century, 
  flair checks out, 
  how much people care about their way of life    how much people care about the military, 
  just no . 
  the living indoeuropean languages are bad enough as is . 
  let 's use actually european languages , shall we ? 
  so finno-ugric or basque, 
  that hurt my brain, 
  well it 's an official language, 
  how do you think the austro-hungarian army used to function ? 
  well at least it 's protected as a language . 
  that is n't true for many other european languages, 
  well i mean given that it used to be in hungary it 's no surprise that it 's where all the culture is :p jk, 
  * plurality . 
  not everyone voted so there 's no majority, 
  i think it 's actually only seeding that is a crime , aka . 
  distribution . 
  just downloading something is i think okay . 
   eastern europeans are like the most racist and xenophobic people on the planet and absolutely hate immigrants  the level of hypocrisy here is just absurd oh the irony, 
  it 's also hidden by the subtitles because you ca n't see shit . 
  with the subtitles you disrespect the visual , with the dubs you disrespect the sound . 
  since sound is less important than vision , it makes sense to dub instead not to sub . 
  this is just my reasoning tho , i really dont care if you subtitle it , i 'm just not gon na watch the movie, 
  its almost as if people have preferences, 
  being disrespectful is subjective , and it should never ever even be thought of as something bad . 
  criminalizing being disrespectful , does europe really need to sink that low ? 
  its less cringy because , you dont know how inaccurate the whole thing is . 
  with subtitles you hear the original and you can see in real time how bad the translator fucked up . 
  thing is , dubbing makes the experience enjoyable . 
  subtitles are just obnoxious and the translation is just as bad , if not worse . 
  you just spend half the time cringing how bad the translation is, 
  [ i mean who would n't understand this glorious language ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ovlinmdeum&amp;ab_channel=csesza ), 
  subtitles are annoying as shit , please no, 
  this is amazing . 
  too bad he wo n't be well known in the west . 
  thanks for posting this op, 
  you also would n't serve a nudist nude , even in the `` civilized world '' , would you ? 
   religion = !, 
  religion is the most pure form of ideology - they do n't even tell you the reasons why you should accept the ideology, 
  that could go terribly wrong though , since the state does n't sell food, 
  nah , because he would be scared to do this . 
  if i was old , i 'd be saying `` this never would 've happened under the communists '', 
  +1 for rick and morty, 
  i do n't think you know which the first people 's republic of hungary was . 
  the first people 's republic came to be after the aster revolution in 1919 , so that one definitely was about the people . 
  kek, 
  he did n't even say anything about hiv, 
   hungarians are here to `` steal horses '' orb\u00e1n is , hungarians arent . 
  ireland and portugal were hitler 's two favorite possessions, 
   orban  people 's pick one, 
   what did slovakia and eastern europe ever contribute ? 
  we made your rich class even more wealthy by buying all the shit from western european companies, 
  3 years, 
  i say only kick orb\u00e1n , the rest of us would like to stay please, 
  i love it when they color the ugly blocks . 
  it 's simple but really changes the way everything feels, 
  pls gib monies, 
  just tax the rich more, 
  exactly why it 's the right that constantly talks about them and they are all stupid according to them, 
  `` millenials think/say x '' is the most typical republican thing in the us, 
  but that 's not true . 
  the land and resources belong to private owners , not the state, 
  some dudes 200 years ago agreed to it , the current inhabitants of texas had fuck all to do about that . 
  it 's not actually as bad as you might think . 
  i was just telling you what / u/ronblue23 meant to say, 
  they love self-determination when it means staying in spain like ceuta , they hate self-determination when it means not staying in spain like catalonia, 
  similarly to russia,
