  he can send something back to the parliament if he thinks it is n't good but if the parliament votes for it again then he ca n't do anything . 
  so yeah , he 's an elected monarch, 
  i do n't think so . 
  he can veto anything the parliament does , that 's the only real function he has . 
  he 's also responsible for representing hungary on the international level , which basically means that he travels to random places on public money, 
  hungarys president doesnt do anything hes literally only there to be a puppet, 
  yes you do . 
  anyone with a french citizenship is legally considered an ethnic french and your government actively denies the existence of any other nationality in there, 
  but he won at the end, 
  and lidl too and tesco . 
  fuck tesco though , hope they get out as soon as the uk leaves, 
  would vatican city be foreign then ? 
  the most ridiculous thing was when they said in the hungarian state tv that  we need a strong eu based around state sovereignty now im sorry but how retarded can this get ? 
  these two contradict each other, 
  iraq and syria werent shitholes before the wars , especially the cities, 
  more people lived there and live there today than the other two combined i think . 
  and originally they wanted to name the city pest-buda too but later they went for budapest because it sounds better and easier to pronounce . 
  now that is cheating though . 
  budapest in hungarian is budapest , pronounced with a ` sh ' sound , exactly like bukarest . 
  though the cheating in hungary is that everyone calls budapest simply pest , so its easy to tell apart, 
   slovak in hungarian - t\u00f3t  slovene in hungarian - vend ez, 
  / r/russiadenies, 
  i think the main problem with the eu is that it is based around governments , not people . 
  the eu tries to unite the 28 governments , not the 500 million people . 
  the first two are not negatives , the last one is simply not true . 
  the eu exists to end the old partition of europe between the us and russia , to restore home rule if you wish . 
  it is not even globalist , people just throw this around to justify their xenophobia, 
  yeah unfortunately the govts have too much influence over eu policies . 
  this is what the ep is for afterall, 
  being in the eu already makes you not neutral unless the eu decides to be neutral as a whole ( which would be great tbh ), 
  how is merging a bunch of otherwise useless shitty armies warmongering ? 
  it would save resources and money , while most countries literally dont even need a local defense force . 
  with this you can also stop the inhumane mandatory drafting like in finland because there would be volunteers from other eu countries who would help out . 
  and there are literally no negatives . 
  well that just sounds weird . 
  so you prefer to have a federal government and basically make a huge federal country , but not make the federal govt have an army ? 
  but there are still people against an eu army ... 
  honestly i have no idea why they give these types of names to their children . 
  the latino sounding names might come from soap operas , but i 'm not sure, 
  exactly . 
  they literally signed up for this . 
  this is their day job . 
  they mostly prefer obscure pagan names , from the link i posted these : zente , kende , kolos , z\u00e9t\u00e9ny would be mostly those , plus others like \u00c1lmos , el\u0151d , kond , zo\u00e1rd to an extent maybe even hunor or nimr\u00f3d , though these last two are not * that * weird . 
  among the girls names zselyke seems the most jobbik-ish to me . 
  there are also a few gypsy-sounding names such as rik\u00e1rd\u00f3 , armand\u00f3 or krisztofer , for girls something like dzsenifer or vanessza . 
  i do n't know why they just like these names a lot . 
  25th most common male name apparently : http://magyarnevek.hu/nevek/utonevstatisztika . 
  it 's actually one of the few traditional hungarian names that wo n't make you look like a huge piece of jobbik shit if you give it to your kid, 
  its a joke dude . 
  chill, 
   i never understood why ~ ~ ukraine and belarus ~ ~ spain wants and still wants independence . 
   they have no distinctive history or culture from the ~ ~ russians ~ ~ portuguese , and truth to be told they are pretty incompetent when it comes to running a nation by themselves . 
  look their history and present after they gained independence . 
  only corruption , poverty , tyrannical regimes and war activities, 
  nato exists for defense against russia and russia will not attack anyone whos allied with nuclear powers , theyre not stupid, 
  this is what americans actually believe ? 
  i though it was my little pony and i was for a sec surprised like , a vote-worthy politician ? 
  like wtf i 've never seen something like that before, 
   from riyadh and mecca . 
  because the christian reformation came from rome or jerusalem ? 
  lol no . 
  * fortunate, 
  as for kaposv\u00e1r btw the prettiest place is [ temesv\u00e1r street in april ] ( http://i.embed.ly/1/display/resize?key=1e6a1a1efdb011df84894040444cdc60&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fscontent.cdninstagram.com%2fhphotos-xaf1%2ft51.2885-15%2fe15%2f11142760_1579705475640185_939159469_n.jpg&amp;width=810 ) , if a building needs to be chosen it 's got to be the [ main square church ] ( http://www.eventing.hu/files/kaposvar.jpg ) . 
  or rupert, 
   can we remove them from ~ ~ eu ~ ~ existence ? 
  we are always happy to help there old friends ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  religion comes with neonazis, 
  it 's ethiopia actually, 
  helvetia is the word you 're looking for . 
  fucking neutral terrorists, 
  hungaria, 
  so you 're a second class citizen if you do n't have strong opinions ? 
  if you did n't vote , they can ignore you in statistics when it comes to percentages ? 
  gives a whole new way to rig elections , really . 
  simply not advertise that there 's elections anywhere except to your own supporters - guaranteed win . 
  yeah that is n't how democracy should work in my opinion . 
  we need to be honest about what percentage of the population voted for what . 
  you can not honestly say `` the majority of the uk favors leaving '' , when it 's really not the case . 
  over here in hungary that 's the same fallacy and it 's having the same disastrous effects - orb\u00e1n was voted into power by a whopping 28 % of voters two years ago for example . 
  `` democracy '', 
  calm down , jesus, 
   embarassingly low turnover where the fuck is 70 % + a low turnout ? 
  i kek 'd . 
  what if we just acknowledged that neither side achieved a majority among voters ( which is 100 % true ), 
  i would move to the eu if i was a remain voter tbh . 
  would n't give leavers the joy of having me fucked over, 
  circlejerking and joking about serious stuff is pretty normal for any age group, 
  the hungary kingdom , yes . 
  the monarchy , no . 
  the hungarian kingdom was n't an independent country , as such it did not have a say whether or not to join the war . 
  the prime minister was openly against it . 
  it 's like if the uk lost a war and you punished scotland for being the aggressor . 
  while sorry , should we just have refused the compromise and stay oppressed under austria ? 
   that heavily oppressed other nations oh , so like france and the uk . 
  got it, 
  but it also mean that 51 % was n't for it . 
  it would be much more fair if those who did n't vote were also represented in the figures . 
  so the brexit referendum was more like 37,4 % leave , 34,7 % remain , 27,8 % did n't vote . 
  yeah but the older people will be less affected . 
  it will be the young who will bear the effects of their decision for way way longer .
