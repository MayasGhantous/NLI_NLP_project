  thank you for telling us , wise man, 
  he is a troll, 
  / r/socialism is a joke at best, 
  i do n't think he was involved, 
  so , it was a battle between two foreign ministries . 
  the `` nations of denmark and sweden '' ? 
  what ? 
  more like , you know , two twitter accounts, 
   what is wrong with the eu and how should it be changed ? 
  it 's not a country yet . 
  it is viewed as a union of 28 nations , instead of the union of 500 million people, 
  but then again it does seem to help with security and identification , no ? 
  what i was saying is that whether you wear a burka or something is purely a personal choice, 
  religion should n't be above objective truth , like , never . 
  and the objective truth is that it is a personal choice . 
  i 'd ban the festival just for trying to do this, 
  i think that is already illegal , restricting personal freedoms like that, 
  well being poor is n't a choice , that 's for sure . 
  this law does target muslims , that 's true too . 
  but i personally think that it 's fine . 
  it may help the situation of female muslims in europe . 
  that is a beautiful quote and everything , but unlike the `` sleeping under the bridge '' thing , wearing something is purely a personal choice . 
  ( and even in the cultural sense . 
  there are other choices in islam too that do n't cover the face , like say a headscarf ), 
  yeah but moscow does n't carry any sort of communist connotation . 
  most people liked it that way , and it 's not like sz\u00e9ll k\u00e1lm\u00e1n was such a great politician anyway ... of course for ukraine moscow now does carry a bad connotation and it makes sense for them to change it . 
  in hungary orb\u00e1n also renamed a place in budapest from `` moszkva t\u00e9r '' . 
  there was no real reason though , he 's just an asshole . 
  what a shit title . 
  everyone else faces fines for it too , not just muslims . 
  you would also feel like a victim if your native language was treated like that , no ? 
  at least acknowledge that this is a toxic way of thinking and a 19th century idea . 
  yes , that 's what i 'm saying, 
  weirdest thing the french also had that ( in alsace/elsass ) ... 
  if you only look at the good looking parts . 
  foreigners should be banned from visiting anything named `` lak\u00f3telep '', 
  no idea, 
  before checking on wiki though i legit thought that [ this ] ( https://www.google.hu/search?q=magash%c3%a1z+p%c3%a9cs&amp;rlz=1c1gigm_enhu562hu562&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=799&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewij0npa2ohnahwcchokhtfpckuq_auibigb ) was the tallest building, 
  latin is the only true language ninja edit : also inb4 some slovak guy comes saying `` ostrihom '', 
  i think the proposal was to make it co-official in corsica . 
  ( the 2 departments that are on corsica ), 
  but the communists let the church run ? 
  hungary 's motto used to be `` regnum mariae , patrona hungariae '' ( kingdom of mary , the patron of hungary ) . 
  no it 's poland and italy . 
  most of the ex-commies are pretty irreligious because of the ban on religiousness during communism . 
  ( except poland , no idea why tho ), 
  maria theresa would be great . 
  she would give motivation bonuses to the whole army, 
  also the first time you managed to win in the first 90 mins . 
  wait , really ? 
  because hungarians used to call them magyars too , as if they were a subgroup of hungarians ( like sz\u00e9kelys , kun people , j\u00e1sz people or pal\u00f3c people , but those spoke hungarian ), 
  sounds legit . 
  sure sure , that is true for literally anything that would change something in anyone 's life . 
  yup . 
  that 's probably what happened here, 
  weird because the only connection is that we lived in the same place * roughly half a milleneum apart in time * . 
  scholars at the time were n't exactly geniuses, 
  europeanism has ambitions on the entire continent , as does the eu ... 
  he should marry orb\u00e1n, 
  yup , and there was actually a semi-successful campaign to take back constantinople from the turks , matthias corvinus actually took vienna just for that . 
  though i 'm not surprised that it 's not in there . 
  the game wants to use civilizations that western/american users are familiar with . 
  but bro huns have literally nothing to do with hungarians . 
  did n't lose either tho . 
  only losers can ever be war criminals . 
  that 's probably what happened . 
  bosniaks are now a majority in the whole country with more than 50 % , something that experts only expected to happen decades later, 
  yup , it 's not in the game . 
  tbh it is the perfect choice, 
  but even then you could be consistent and call them like t\u00f3tf\u00f6ld - t\u00f3tok , to match up with the national name . 
  this whole `` lets call them by a different name '' is really just the subtle way of saying `` i do n't want you to live where you live '', 
  yeah . 
   national identity prior to 1848 was nearly non-existent . 
  exactly . 
   what is propaganda is often matter of point of view . 
  of course , that is true . 
  there are probably also many who * do * think that the 1968 uprising was fascists , it is okay , of course , to think the way you want . 
   i 'm sure you can make something up . 
  nah i think we 're fine like this . 
  we already have justification if we wanted to have an empire, 
  it has `` bratislavsk\u00e9ho '' in it tho , but i can believe this one . 
  it shows pretty clearly that intellectuals have used it that since pretty long . 
  what about peasants ? 
  ( who lets be honest made up most of the slovak population ) did they also have a different word for these ? 
  i highly doubt that , simply because it would n't be useful in daily life , and because they usually had a pretty weak national identity ( like anyone else as well before nationalism ), 
  yes . 
  i mean do n't you see how it 's propaganda to have the country called ungarn with `` magyaren '' instead of calling in ungarn with ungarischen ? 
  it 's actually so disgusting as a tool for propaganda , that it 's a very often used tactic by butthurt jobbik supporters ( they say szlov\u00e1kia - t\u00f3tok instead of szlov\u00e1kia - szlov\u00e1kok ) . 
  this is how disgusting nationalistic lows czechoslovakia and austria were hitting at the time . 
  it is useful for propaganda reasons . 
   so maybe you should do it too . 
  how, 
  i 'm fairly sure you did n't distinguish either until for * some reason * it became useful to do so . . 
  okay , let 's see a source that uses ma\u010far before nationalism came about . 
  afterall you say it was so always, 
  okay , that is not the point , i do n't speak czech or slovak , sorry edit :  uhersky brod reffers to the town being the bridgeway into koh , what czech language always reffered to as `` uhry '' or `` uhorsko '' , nothing to do with ethnical group nothing at the time had to do ethnical groups , but hear me out on this . 
  uhorsko refers to the kingdom , the kingdom is called `` magyarorsz\u00e1g '' in hungarian . 
  logically , if you borrow the word `` magyar '' to slovak , it should refer to the kingdom too ... like in hungarian , where magyar referred to anyone in the kingdom , including slovaks . . ( until nationalism came about ofc , french-style ethnonationalism only hurt people ever ), 
  source ? 
  in romanian it 's not even true today , they use unguresc and maghiar interchangeably,
