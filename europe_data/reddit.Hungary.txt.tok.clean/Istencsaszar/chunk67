  the second one was about which ideology should be the most influential in europe ( you could make the argument that the first part of ww2 was a larger scale version of the spanish civil war , with one side supporting fascism and the other democracy ), 
  we vote on the `` european parties '' , and the candidate from the winning party becomes the leader of the commission , i think that 's fair . 
  what i think is stupid though is that the `` european parties '' is really just a bunch of national parties coming together , to be corrupt on the eu level rather than just on the petty national level . 
   hungarian language - it sounds very ugly to our ears . 
  how dare you , coming from a * slavic * language , insult the glorious hungarian language ? 
  ( / s ) :p, 
  just the k\u00f6niglich part :p, 
  they should n't though . 
  many greek-speaking people were n't even considered greeks , for example macedonians ( for example alexander the great ), 
  sadly lots of people are brainwashed with the culture = language thing, 
  [ louis i ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/louis%27s_kingdoms_and_his_vassal_territories.png/1280px-louis%27s_kingdoms_and_his_vassal_territories.png ) aliv in visegr\u00e1d, 
  it is going to be useless unless we also nuke the 1 state = 1 nation idiocy too , because if that 's still in place they 're gon na still brainwash people to nationalism, 
   you ca n't have a country with populations that want radically different things yes you can . 
  that 's what having different political parties is for . 
  if you want to have a country where everyone shares views you should take a look at the vatican , because that 's pretty much the only one, 
  that 's already in place , and a discussion for another time, 
  germany in charge is still better than france or uk being in charge . 
   the first european civil war ww2 was in a way a european civil war already - it went on to establish a dominant political system , and it resulted in europe being split in two . 
  in my city we voted [ this ] ( http://kapos.hu/static/keptar/15/b/3002.jpg ) bus design . . for our defense though , the other choices we had were shittier, 
  im not saying they did n't outsource * some * , i 'm saying that the black blob in poland is not that . 
  the outsourced industries are extremely clean compared to the soviet relic industry that was in place in poland ( and the rest of the eastern bloc ), 
  why , where do you want to import wood from ? 
  china ? 
  you ca n't be serious about that black thing in poland being the german industry outsourced . 
  you haven no fucking idea how many dirty fucking factories the commies built , especially around that area ( katowice , krakow etc , it 's a huge coal mine basically ) ? 
  ofc you do n't , ignorant asshole, 
  to be fair though , it 's virtually impossible to use a rhetorical figure that * was n't * already used in ancient greece, 
  but the fact is not contributing to that argument . 
  you could also say that e = mc ^ 2 but that isnt an argument supporting brexit ... 
  if theres no blame , why are they using it as an argument ? 
  that 's not the eu 's fault and is n't gon na be stopped by brexit . 
  it 's an absolutely worthless argument . 
  again . 
  that 's due to the success of china , not due to the eu economy `` crashing '', 
   eu as a percentage of the global economy so , is the eu to blame for china getting an industry ? 
  according to brexiters - yes !, 
  why would he care ? 
  so weird that we are not . 
  we had a historical friendship thing going on with armenia and orb\u00e1n singlehandedly fucked it up so badly . 
  and this too, 
  they must be related to habsburgs, 
  actually , you will always be a champion , not just for a year, 
  the companies have a right to have a dress code , pretty obvious . 
  i have one of those too , have to agree but still . 
  i ca n't look at a phone under 50 % without worrying atleast a little bit, 
  please for the love of god , put that phone on charger, 
  okay , look , whatever floats your boat . 
  in my opinion it 's a bit weird to celebrate effectively sacking a city . 
  i thought atat\u00fcrks reforms were the heart of turkish culture , the literal opposite of the ottoman empire ? 
   both light and heavy weapons , including mortars . 
  they are totally just the locals who want the yoke of ukrainian oppression off of them , they are absolutely not supported by anyone, 
  why though ? 
  it was absolutely not a positive thing for the locals , and it did n't have much of an effect on the turkish nation at the time . 
  it just grew an empire that hardly was good to * anyone * living in it . 
  or maybe it would n't . 
  i 'm sure the turks would appreciate becoming eu citizens in an instant . 
  yes , and took in hundreds of thousands of polish refugees , and refused to let german troops to go through during the invasion of poland . 
  but we were their puppets , sure as hell we were , amirite, 
   if something is common , then that does n't necessarily make it correct . 
  yes it does . 
  what else would ? 
  dutch speakers use holland to refer to north + south holland , that 's why it 's correct so * in dutch * . 
  english speakers use holland for the country , that 's why that 's correct * in english * . 
  english speakers also use holland for north + south holland , so that 's correct too . 
  also ungv\u00e1r rightful hungarian clay, 
   it is hard to be ~ ~ russian ~ ~ anti-ukrainian elsewhere in ukraine nowadays ftfy, 
  wait , so you are puppet if you help your allies ? 
  especially in return for all they have done for you ( [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_vienna_award ) , [ 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_vienna_award ) , and after yugoslavia 's invasion : [ 3 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_occupation_of_yugoslav_territories ) ), 
   since much earlier thats not true though , not at all . 
  slovakia was a puppet since day one , while in hungary being a nazi puppet only really started in 1943 , arguably 44, 
  out of curiosity , where 're you from ? 
  in somogy these cube houses are way more common, 
  that video , and many others from cgp grey are / r/badlinguistics material . 
  calling the netherlands holland is a very common thing for english speakers to do . 
  as such , it is correct by definition . 
  thats how languages work . 
  and especially as a non native speaker , you shouldnt shame english speakers because you dont like their language . 
  they are not in the wrong, 
  i heard rural people pronounce ` krumpli ' as ` kumpi ' , and tbh i find myself say it like that sometimes . 
  the rest are obvious loanwords and are barely used . 
  edit : why the downvotes ? 
  you have severe paranoia - nobody is out to kill russia , or you for that matter, 
  maybe , just maybe , we should n't allow non eu citizens to teach , preach or do anything similar . 
  just maybe, 
  multiculturalism ? 
  having different people abide different laws and go to different courts is now just `` multiculturalism '' ? 
  why are downvoted though . 
  this changes everything we know about physics , are ppl not allowed to have doubts ? 
  not really a tongue twister though , the only part one would struggle with is the first two sounds : kr - never appears in native hungarian words . 
  rural areas have [ these ] ( https://www.google.hu/search?q=r%c3%a9gi+kockah%c3%a1z&amp;rlz=1c1gigm_enhu562hu562&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=799&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjg9ogszvjmahxftrqkhalqa1aq_auibigb#tbm=isch&amp;q=kockah%c3%a1z ) usually , not the peasant homes , those are just there for the tourists, 
  yeah that 's a heavily romanticized peasant home, 
  nationalism , everyone, 
  because people call it that, 
   more german speakers than natives what ? 
  ohno , its russia profiting from the eus instability !, 
  who wouldve thought ? 
  no it wont . 
  eurosceptics who hate juncker oh so much didnt do shit so far - not a single protest or anything . 
  do you think they could stage a coup ? 
  lol .
