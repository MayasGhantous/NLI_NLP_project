  no it wasnt . 
  he just pointed out his ethnicity to insult him . 
  if he did that the same to his race or gender , would it also be this funny ? 
  replace it with `` racists '' and no one bats an eye - replace it with `` far right '' and everyone loses their shit . 
  comparing hitler to napoleon tho . 
  napoleon was the first chance for a united europe , and the fucking brits ruined it - and they are on to do it again . 
  what a bunch of cunts, 
   dictators must keep up with our times . 
  this would be a great summary of history, 
  eh , i 'd say from about '70 onwards we still got the best out of a communist system possible , and got out of it the moment the opportunity presented itself . 
  i would n't call that ` nothing ', 
  yeah yeah , but k\u00e1d\u00e1r 's death was a huge opportunity that we could use effectively . 
  this year this huge mass of people who were angry with the system were in one place , yet we did n't do anything useful with that, 
  i meant the time between k\u00e1d\u00e1r 's death ( the good opportunity for change ) and the proclamation of the republic . 
  that was n't that much time , was it ? 
  nothing happened tho . 
  and it 's only been 27 years, 
   like tens of years mfw it took less than a year last time ( in 1989 ), 
  because who would want to change it ? 
  there were huge protests but they do n't do shit just speak about how shit everything is ( which is true but it does n't lead anywhere ) . 
  when the education protests happened i was amazed how many people * just stood there like nothing important 's going on * . 
  ffs if you want to incite change you have to pull an 1848 or 1956 level shit , there 's nothing else orb\u00e1n would be afraid of enough . 
  that 's just how politicians work, 
   austria , hungary nah , let 's get it straight here . 
  you fought against the austro-hungarian monarchy . 
  austria and hungary came to existence in 1919 , after the war , and you did n't fight either of them, 
  sure , why tho, 
  amsterdam should be tijuana instead - ppl go there for drugs and hookers . 
  how 's that a bad thing though ? 
  it 's in a way similar to 19th century imperialism - back then the excuse was `` oh they are uncivilized '' , now it 's `` oh they 're not patriotic towards russia '' . 
  it 's actually the same thing tho , just wrapped differently, 
  i think the fact that they just swapped ideologies like that just how little they are about the ideologies themselves and how much they are owned by the oligarchy, 
  it 's not russia 's business if it does n't involve russia . 
  period, 
  that 's not even a fucking basis . 
  why would you even bother with fighting off nazis in a different country when they are not a threat to yours ? 
  oh , ofcourse , when you 're an imperialist, 
  basically : they do n't understand how infamy works, 
  no no i 'm okay with 1900, 
  i mean costa rica does n't even have a military , anyone could conquer it , even an army equipped with brooms, 
  it would n't be as poor on average if you excluded the poor part from the calculation, 
  what ? 
  what would i be ashamed of ? 
  you ca n't talk about the origin of x million people like that . 
  it 's possible that some of their ancestors did speak a slavic language . 
  again , slavic is a language group , only those who identify themselves as slavic are slavic . 
  being born and raised to speak a slavic language only makes you a speaker , nothing more . 
  and they identify as bulgarian . 
  it is very probable that among their ancestors there were bulgar turks , slavic speakers , thracians/illyrians etc etc. 
  most people are incredibly mixed genetically , you ca n't just say ` these millions of people are directly descended from these hundreds of thousands of people ' . 
  it 's stupid, 
  yeah , why would you care . 
  most cultures speak the language they could use the best where they live, 
  they are bulgarians . 
  grouping anyone with anyone else solely because they speak a related language is stupid and very 19th century, 
  did you even read my comment ? 
  i never said that they do n't speak a south slavic language, 
  language is the language spoken . 
  by that logic americans are english, 
  but that would be homosex, 
  [ the father of the hydrogen bomb ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edward_teller ), 
   as for sz\u00f6r\u00e9nyi i have no idea what it refers to sz\u00f6r\u00e9nyv\u00e1r or sz\u00f6r\u00e9ny v\u00e1ra = turnu severin   are `` szags '' but romania is romania ? 
  well , first off , the suffix is '' - orsz\u00e1g '' ( country ) , and there 's another equivalent suffix , - ia ( i know this one is n't really a suffix but it acts like that in hungarian ) . 
  so basically , country names are formed by the name of the people plus one of these suffixes . 
  but during the 19th century many new names came in that hungarians did n't have many connections with before , but their names in latin ended in - ia and that grammaticalized in hungarian like this : d\u00e1n `` danish '' + ia = d\u00e1nia , holland + - ia = hollandia and ofcourse rom\u00e1n + ia = rom\u00e1nia and szlov\u00e1k + ia = szlov\u00e1kia . 
  others here are norv\u00e9gia ( norway ) , szerbia , portug\u00e1lia and the very newest is sz\u00edria , because syrians are now called ` sz\u00edr ' and not ` sz\u00edriai ' as before , with the simple - i which means `` from x '' , like in the names in my last comment so `` rom\u00e1nia '' is a fairly new construct , there are poems from the early 20th century that refer to it as `` ol\u00e1horsz\u00e1g '' , from ol\u00e1h ` vlach ' . 
  these types of names are common in hungary too : fogarasi , szil\u00e1gyi , sz\u00f6r\u00e9nyi , sz\u00e9kely etc. 
  strangely enough there 's also magyar and magyary , literally `` hungarian '' ... weird . 
  although it 's fairly hard to tell which of these are actually hungarian , because many jews made up these types of names and used them to hide that they were jews during ww2 and before it , most notable example being the hungarian jewish poet ; mikl\u00f3s radn\u00f3ti ... 
  hydrogen bombs probably are n't, 
  it was so unnecessary to reply to that though, 
  in romania that 's a jet, 
  that compensates it i guess, 
  also , you know , rubiks cubes and hydrogen bombs and arguably computers, 
  this is stupid . 
  if you can enter a legal union you should be able to leave it , no matter what it is, 
  hungary 's government is just beyond retarded, 
   slovaks  being an actual nation topkek, 
  oh , i was n't referring to ungrovlachia with the cs\u00e1ng\u00f3 thing , i meant the names ungur/ungureanu . 
  btw there is the name `` ol\u00e1h '' in hungarian too . 
   it 's names that they were given to transylvanian families that emigrated from transylvania to romanian kingdom when did that happen though ? 
  in school we only learned of the thing the other way round , like the hunyadi family . 
  that could be because few hungarians used to live in wallachia and moldova ( in moldova they still exist , they are called cs\u00e1ng\u00f3 / ceang\u0103i ? , literally ` wanderers ' ) . 
  there are even hungarian names for many towns in romania proper , though they are rarely used these days - t\u00eergovi\u015fte = v\u00e1s\u00e1ros , ia\u015fi = j\u00e1szv\u00e1s\u00e1r etc. 
  hungarians used to be nomadic , like shittons of other ethnic groups on the steppe , but according to some that makes us mongolian ? 
  maybe it 's because of the language ? 
  but then basques would be mongolian too ... 
  muslim israelis i think exists as a term, 
  no , you just do n't exist outside romania proper according to jobbik . 
  if you enter transylvania you automatically become hungarian ( as in , speak hungarian ) because transylvania is * obviously * hungarian, 
  because they are citizens of [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_of_palestine ), 
  `` i am older than slovakia '', 
   romanians are gypsies that ca n't be , there are gypsies in transylvania  romanians are slav nah they 're worst  romania is great , i love budapest !, 
  this is offensive to everyone  transylvania is hungarian tru dat, 
   hungary - you mean european mongolian this would actually not insult anyone , just some ppl actually think it 's hilarious . 
  the people who have national pride actually have in * that * , and those who do n't just do n't care, 
  it 's not even pejorative but slovaks think it is, 
  romanian = citizen of romania in english . 
  it is highly disgusting and tbh offensive to use it that way but welcome to the english language . 
  that seems right tho,
