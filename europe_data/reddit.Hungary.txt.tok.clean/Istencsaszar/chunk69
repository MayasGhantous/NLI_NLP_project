   that noisy minority 's one . 
  this means violence btw , incase anyone is not familiar with how eastern europe works, 
  that 's a highly inaccurate version of the immigration theory though . 
  it says that hungarians in 1490 constituted 80-90 % of the population of hungary proper , and that in transylvania mainly two areas were populated originally by romanians : fogarasf\u00f6ld / f\u0103g\u0103r\u0103\u015f and the area near h\u00e1tszeg / ha\u0163eg , this latter includes the rivers named ol\u00e1h-zsil and magyar-zsil ( vlach-jiu and hungarian-jiu ) for example , so there 's definitely basis of that, 
  jobbik ppl will deny the existence of romanians altogether ... 
  corsica and sardinia should be both / j / btw , and occitan has / dz / or / d\u0292 /, 
  well this one triggers us too . 
  suck it slovaks , everyone knows you 're just slavic hungarians, 
   you have  goulash triggered, 
  i 'm not sure if you can call snails cuisine, 
  that 's specific ... like , which towns ? 
  because there are literally 3000 people who identify as rusyn in the whole country , and even they are scattered, 
  they would take that even more offensively than hollandia , because it literally translates to `` german lowland '', 
  i always thought hungary was already at its very minimal size , what places would be part of ruthenia ? 
  i can understand poland , but hungary ? 
  what , why , how ? 
  yeah so ruthenia spans across the carpathians , right ? 
  or is it all in the carpathian basin but it has parts of slovakia ? 
  its a bit unclear, 
  ruthenia ? 
  is this a synonym for carpatho-ukraine ? 
  do n't you call us * hongri\u00eb * by default ? 
  it absolutely does n't matter, 
  you are no authority over how people call you . 
  furthermore , in hungarian you ca n't even say ` netherlands ', 
  this whole thread is just a big list of `` why we need an eu army asap '', 
  because the us is better exactly how ? 
  they are controlled by the oligarchy exactly as much as we are , the only difference is that they control two parties while here only 1 . 
  literally every country does that, 
  i would personally use 's \u0302i ' only and replace ` ili ' with ` li ' , once again getting rid of a 100 % useless extra syllable, 
  yeah , in certain cases you can do that even in hungarian . 
  the fundamental problem with it is that it 's just not practical , ` estas ' is two syllables , if anyone were to use it in non-formal speech it would shorten to something more suitable for such a grammatical function . 
  just compare the very word it was based off of : latin ` est ' , french ` est ' / e / , italian ` e\u0300 ' , spanish ` es ' etc. 
  it would never survive in a spoken language as ` estas ' . 
  another incredibly stupid thing that just blows my mind is that while zamenhof hated grammatical gender , he * still * uses ` li ' versus 's \u0302i ' ... like , that 's literally grammatical gender right there . 
  it 's pointless and nowadays even more so because all the transgender shit going on . 
  and these are just the easy to spot ones . 
  hungarize = to destroy and humiliate beyond repair, 
  and things like this is why i do n't understand people who think esperanto is so perfect . 
  it 's just not, 
  why not `` la \u0109ielo blua '' , leaving out the copula ? 
  it 's still 100 % unambiguous, 
  esperanto would only work in writing , it 's incredibly difficult to use in speaking because it 's not compact enough . 
  just think about it , `` estas '' for copula ? 
  at least if it was allowed to omit it , this way it 's just not good, 
  it 's more fun if you hear the ep members try and do that accent :p, 
  this would be glorious in the eu parliament . 
  i 'd love it, 
  i need this in my life, 
  proud of you finns :'), 
  `` hey , you guys are hungarian too '', 
  if there were other hungarian tourists there their first words would be `` j\u00e9 ti is magyarok vagytok ? '', 
  and instant friendship would ensue . 
  that 's just how it is , idk why, 
  hungarians too , but we are right about that :p, 
  it always comes in handy if ppl do n't understand anything of your language, 
  within army groups ( idk how you call them , divisions ? ), 
  you can communicate in your native language , only the higher command would have different native languages, 
   pro-russian politicians  in eastern europe topkek, 
  yeah ... 
  til nobody can speak a foreign language , especially not the leaders of well-trained army groups, 
  good, 
  a snickers costs less than 100ft, 
  we are not trying to do that . 
  we just ignore the international borders for every practical purpose and dont give a fuck, 
  theyre culturally european . 
  i have more problems with azerbaijan being in there tbh . 
  ahem, 
  nope , sorry : /, 
  edgy, 
   there does n't seem to be anything here uh , thanks ? 
   they 'd be easy prey anytime russia felt like grabbing some land most were already nato members you idiot , aka . 
  us defense would be here  millions upon millions of desperate , unemployed people . 
  made unemployed by western companies like tesco and lidl . 
  for reaping those disgusting profits here you can just well take in these hardworking people . 
  do you think you can just make your capitalists run down here and fuck us like that without consequences ? 
  i 'm so sad that that does n't exist, 
  i do n't either , but i 'm still white . 
  do n't forget these : [ 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxo9iex8w1c&amp;ab_channel=fuckyoupedophile4 ) , [ 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub7bxrnswo0&amp;ab_channel=islamicnasheedmusic ), 
  its because of dancs\u00f3 's video on it where he makes a detailed analysis, 
  it was mainly a reference to that romanians usually refer to everything pre-1920 as `` occupation '' , so i was just returning the favor :p, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iumb9e_zsy#misshmusic the main line `` csak baszunk \u00e9s baszunk \u00e9s pont '' ( we will fuck and fuck and period ) is the best meme around the country these days ninjaedit : [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgbw8vs0iy8&amp;ab_channel=realtrillmusic ) is dec 2013 i hope it 's okay, 
  calm down man , it was just [ banter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transylvania ), 
  estonia is finno-ugric bros, 
  ahem, 
  same in hungarian , though it 's sorta outdated now , younger people would say `` it finally fell [ for you ] '', 
  yeah , the only uralic language to have articles is hungarian, 
  wait , so you being from augsburg makes all swabians bavarians ? 
  whaat, 
  yeah , hiberno-english speakers , not english english speakers . 
  you 're just jelly you do n't have such a unique language :p, 
   topkek you are literally laughing at something i did n't say . 
  if the brexit happens ( hopefully it wont , but i do n't think we 'd miss you all too much ) , then the eu will have * literally no * citizens who speak english english as native language . 
  that 's a fact . 
   eu is not a nation , and it likely will never be . 
  i really hope it never does . 
  nationalism is cancerous enough already , imagine it implemented on this level . 
  it should become a country though  you are probably thinking of europe . 
  no i was thinking of the eu , since that 's what you 're trying to leave , not europe, 
  ofcourse we do !,
