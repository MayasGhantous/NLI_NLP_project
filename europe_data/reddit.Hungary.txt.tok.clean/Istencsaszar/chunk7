  that doesnt make you look less stupid . 
  yeah that 's a tough question ... 
  more than 100km from the coast is definitely inland , valladolid is inland too . 
  you know that toledo was the capital of spain before madrid , and c\u00f3rdoba was the center of islam there before the reconquista ? 
  all of them are inland . 
  i imagine the whole eu army as something that is literally the current national armies with federal supervision , so you 'd just use a part of the federal army to do it . 
  only if they attack the eu itself . 
  not in any other case . 
  that seems like a good idea , no ? 
  for brits i understand you dont like it but every other european country would like it more to have eu forces protecting them than uk-us troops . 
  yes , that 's true . 
  the ~ ~ flaklands ~ ~ falklands were n't inhabited ever , so ... is that even imperialism ? 
  i think overseas uk holdings are not part of the eu but i do n't think there 's a real concern to adding them in . 
  or is there ? 
  im not sure, 
  force ? 
  since when is the eu like the us ? 
   developing a `` european '' identity that replaces our national identities woah , hitler, 
  but you could protect it with your own military . 
  the countries get vetoes for all-eu military actions , aka . 
  you wo n't be able to have everyone else help you with it if they veto . 
  why does russia have to protect russia minorities in other countries ? 
  atheism is just another shitty religion though, 
   roma are ( orthodox ) christians . 
  no way , most are not religious but even those who are are probably catholic , atleast in traditionally catholic countris ( such as slovakia and hungary ), 
  ohhh , well that makes sense, 
  potatoes in the mouth are a sign of wealth for latvians , so they naturally find it attractive . 
  this is the only explanation i can think of . 
  i do n't get it either, 
  it 's a hipster thing nowadays to like/learn finnish for some reason . 
  i mean it 's really a beautiful ( and logical ) language but some people just go crazy about it, 
   so why not this ? 
  because it is an ethical rule , and it doesnt/shouldnt bother anyone whether you follow it or dont . 
  this can be said about all the rules though here . 
  3 good commandments that are infact the basis of our society today , and 7-8 more that are ethical , and do no harm if you dont actively force anyone to believe in it and follow them . 
  aka , if you follow these you wont do bad stuff , nothing that harms society or even other people . 
  the real retarded stuff in the bible are the `` kill all the sinners '' and other juicy bullshits , which actually do a lot of harm if you follow their instructions . 
  well lets see :  i am the lord thy god lolnope  thou shalt have no other gods lolnope  no graven images or likenesses this one makes no sense , but it doesnt harm either  not take the lord 's name in vain same  remember the sabbath day makes sense  honour thy father and thy mother makes sense i guess ( ? ), 
   thou shalt not kill makes perfect sense  thou shalt not commit adultery if you dont try to enforce it on others it doesnt harm  thou shalt not steal makes complete sense  thou shalt not bear false witness makes complete sense  thou shalt not covet makes sense i guess summary : 2 retarded ; 4 maybe ; 5 makes sense . . ( yes it adds up to 11 , i copied from wikipedia ), 
  ukraine ( de facto war ), 
   like most ideas originating from religion that 's a little harsh , though . 
  there 's a lot of ideas from christianity that are good , such as ` dont kill ' ` dont steal ' etc. 
  there are bunch of more specific rules which are retarded , usually the more specific a religion is on a topic the more retarded it is in my experience . 
   common sense is n't that common best quote ever, 
  topkek, 
  cluj and timisoara are definitely not underrated by hungarians lol . 
  though we probably underrate anything on the other side of the carpathians , iasi , bucuresti , craiova , constanta , buzau i dont know anything about these, 
  yes, 
  you mean soproni , lol , sopron is a town . 
  sopron , it 's undoubtedly the most western town in hungary ( both in the literal sense and culturally ) , even more so than budapest in my opinion, 
  to be honest hungry is still better than , say , macaristan ... 
  you 're welcome ( ? ), 
  hungary can into sea !, 
  no i mean like every guy in a different place . 
  the government could buy a bunch of houses in random towns/villages and get someone in every house, 
  why dont they give them a house in a different town ? 
  they finally will into nordic then, 
  but why dont they give them houses outside of london , where everything 's cheaper ? 
  as far as i know this is how things worked during communism ( not sure about the illegality thing , tho i 'm sure for example not having a job * was * illegal ), 
  who said you 're gon na get a house in london if you ask for it there ? 
  diarrhea in english is a disease , not a type of shit , and turd is just another word for shit . 
  well , english does n't , so i assumed not too many languages do . 
  no , i mean like fh\u00edo ** nn ** . 
  i know about the lenition & eclipsis , but why the double consonants randomly ? 
  works in hungarian too , so not just slavic : baszni - to fuck bebaszni - a. to break b. get drunk kibaszni - to fuck with someone , to betray lebaszni - to discipline/punish ( hard to explain meaning , sorry ) felbaszni - to make angry megbaszni - to fuck elbaszni - to fuck up \u00e1tbaszni - to fuck with/betray r\u00e1baszni - to fail ( again , hard to explain ) odabaszni - to dominate ( ? , again , hard to explain ) sz\u00e9tbaszni - to demolish/destroy f\u00e9lrebaszni ( rare ) - to throw away , but literally t\u00f6nkrebaszni - to make something not work anymore , usually violently, 
  s - ` and ' \u00f3 - ` old ' a - ` the ' e - ` this ' \u0151 - ` he/she ', 
  but then why do you have double consonants ? 
  same here, 
  yes , we call it ` cicceg\u00e9s ' , and we write ` c-c-c ' for english ` tsk-tsk-tsk ' or ` tut-tut-tut ', 
  speaking of shit , hungarian has different words for solid and liquid shit . 
  yes , for example in hungarian from the root ` szent ' ( saint ) , you can form ` legeslegmegszents\u00e9gtelen\u00edthetetlenebbeitekk\u00e9nt ' . 
  in hungarian there 's a suffix that can be theoretically applied to the same word infinite times , so there is no limit . 
   bhfhearr i imagine this is one of those words where only a few select letters get the privilege of getting pronounced , like * fh\u00edonn * which i learned sounds exactly the same as hungarian * \u00edn * ... edit : is it pronounced as ` vyar ' btw ? 
  in hungarian ` night ' is ' \u00e9j ' . . not much better tbh, 
  in hungary we call the netherlands ` hollandia ' , because the translation for ` netherlands ' would be ` alf\u00f6ld ( ek ) ' , and that 's [ already a thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_hungarian_plain ), 
  pft everyone knows hungary is rohan , transylvania is gondor and the rest of romania is mordor . 
  i think tolkien made it pretty obvious . 
  rohan & horses = glorious hungary , sauron = dracula . . ( / s obvious ), 
  me and my friend romania would like to join for some tasty parts of ukraine too , 
  india is hungary confirmed, 
  yes , 5 is the best , 1 is the worst . 
  yes its getting very late-ish xd sorry for the shitty pun . 
  that 's true, 
  next minute ill be something completely different . 
  am i your boss now ?
