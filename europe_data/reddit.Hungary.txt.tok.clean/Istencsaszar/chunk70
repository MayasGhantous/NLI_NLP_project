  we also overuse them like a boss . 
  if there 's a language that absolutely * loves * articles ( especially definite ones ) , it 's hungarian, 
  yeah , it 's okay though . 
  it was still easy to understand, 
   that 's ** the ** point oh okay sorry , did n't really realize, 
   thus the concept of foreign does n't apply topkek . 
  so a japanese would be just as native to the eu as a german ? 
  yes it absolutely does . 
  eu citizens = not foreign ; not eu citizens = foreign, 
  but to the eu it will be foreign then . 
  it would make no sense to use the language of the country that literally betrayed the eu ( if brexit happens , that is ), 
  no , budapest and bucharest . 
  there was even a meme some years ago when some foreign musician in hungary said bucharest instead of budapest, 
  netherlands ? 
  i thought that was a polite way to talk about your butt, 
  if brexit happens , then english english will be foreign too ... 
  most hungarians dont like him . 
  he got 2/3ds because most ppl didnt even vote . 
  also / r/europe being the shithole it is , downvoting the only reasonable comment in favor of the retarded ones gg, 
  his comment is accurate, 
  who cares if they are christians or not, 
  if the united states government and everything magically ceased to exist , and the territory redristributed between canada and mexico ( does n't matter what countries , but lets stick to this ) . 
  would you still consider yourself american in this case ? 
  yet you call yourselves literally americans , which i suppose is n't codeword for the american continent , but for the state called the united states of america , right ? 
  would you retain your identity as such if as a political entity , the us would n't exist ? 
  ( purely hypothetical question ) would you retain your identity as such if the area in which you live was controlled by , say , canada ? 
  oh , this is i guess again me falling to the weirdness of the english language . 
  we in hungarian have more different words , and there 's one that would blow your mind : `` nemzetis\u00e9g '' is translated to nationality , but it 's not actually tied to a physical country , nor to an ethnicity . 
  this is what i meant  people of all different back grounds cultures and religions come together as one nation that is fine , what i 'm saying that this should not be a tied to state . 
  people could do this , come together as one nation a whatever , but why the need for the secular power to reflect this event , which is a cultural thing ? 
  religious identity is , too . 
  yet nobody seems to think that religion should be the basis of a state ( except isis ) . 
  so why is ok for national identity ? 
  so which culture does nationalism promote then ? 
  the country 's - which is tied to land regardless of people , or the nation 's - tied to the people ( of one ethnicity i guess , though this term i could never grasp really in english ) , but regardless of the land ? 
  i tell you , it does n't even matter . 
  in both cases , literally by definition it 's completely unnecessary for it to promoted by the state . 
  in the first case , nationalism would not have to be involved in politics - the supporters of it would simply promote whatever culture is popular at the time , because no matter what happens to the local culture , be it completely replaced by something new , they would still support it by definition . 
  in the second case , the culture they love would not be tied to a geographical location - this should already make it separate from a state , which is bound to a geographic location . 
  there 's even a beautiful solution for this kind of culture promotion - the so called national personal autonomy . 
  it 's clear though that nationalism does n't do either kind of culture promotion , but rather this perverse , unhealthy merging of the two . 
  this is incredibly useful to state ( not the ` current ruling party ' , the state in general ) because it creates zealous people who want to protect the * state * , the * country * , while it 's disguised as protecting their * culture * ( or promoting , whatever ) . 
   people exist , cultures exist , laws exist and history exists . 
  sure . 
  why do i only care about * my * country 's ? 
  secondly , what even defines my country ? 
  it 's as arbitrary as it gets . 
  also , do you think that my country has * one * culture ? 
  the fuck ? 
  it used to have a diverse culture , until the very nationalism that oh so well promotes national culture came about . 
  and what 's even weirder is that this , already pretty weird ideology is combined with the country = state mentality . 
  from my pov , it 's just promoted by the state to gain unconditional support from the people . 
  what are you on about ? 
  you said nothing nationalism has to do with ? 
  nationalism is just religion disguised as reasonable . 
  just replace ` the nation ' or ` the homeland ' with ` god ' and you 'll see it, 
  i thought being eastern european just meant that you were really drunk and really often . 
   historial leaders you mean , literally * two * of them ? 
  unfortunately we do n't, 
  no , ofcourse not , he just created a masterpiece about the unity of people in general which lasted centuries , how dare a community based on uniting people use it as its anthem, 
  yeah , as we all know , beethoven did nothing but wasted eu money, 
   ~ ~ belgium ~ ~ western europe is a huge mess . 
  ftfy, 
  the us only wants us to be in nato , which is n't much . 
  russia wants to be involved in our internal politics , to dictate who rules the country , wants to modify what we teach our kids , so it looks like they are the best etc etc etc. 
  i would choose the us over russia when it comes to world superpower . 
   by some miracle , us will face economic collapse ? 
  i place my hope in the eu , i mean the uk + france + germany is a pretty good trio, 
  no , russian occupation was genuinely shit . 
  you do n't need the propaganda to tell you that . 
  like anyone read the textbooks . 
  seriously , not even the authors read them, 
  but they suck dick compared to the rest of the eastern european countries . 
  was london somehow good before the diversity ? 
  no , [ goulash ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/goulash_communism ) was a part of hungary, 
  then hope that the author gets fired because his article didnt get enough clicks or sth, 
   transfers within countries are justified by a common culture/identity no it 's not . 
  it makes absolutely no sense , its as arbitrary as it gets . 
  nato - also known as us puppets club . 
  a federal europe should form asap , and either be a single , but in power equivalent force to the us ( in influence i mean , not military spending ) in nato , or leave it altogether, 
  what do you expect , they live from our clicks . 
  just do n't click the link , do n't read it , and hope that they eventually go broke, 
  wow , youre such a nice fellow, 
  yeah in that case it 's okay . 
  there are no problems with him believing in whatever he believes in . 
  that is a personal matter . 
  what does matter is whether he acts on those beliefs . 
  if he actually follows the quran , for example , then it is a bad thing, 
  why does it take 5 months to start the trials ? 
  honest question, 
  in history classes we are taught about that ( how the two romanian vassals of the ottomans was havasalf\u00f6ld and moldva ), 
  interestingly in hungarian you could say ol\u00e1horsz\u00e1g for the whole romania , because the wallachia region has its own name : havasalf\u00f6ld, 
  they can sound similar to some , but they are fundamentally different vowels, 
  depends on the accent , i guess certain british accents do that . 
  the accents i hear the most usually pronounce `` h ** o ** t '' as hungarian ` a ' and `` f ** a ** ther '' as ' \u00e1 ' . 
  though \u00f6 does n't exist in any dialect of english , still, 
   ( '' \u00f6 '' is pronounced like the `` e '' in hunter )  ( '' \u00e1 '' is pronounced like the `` u '' in hunter ) these are both lies tho . 
  for the latter there 's even a better english approximation : the vowel in f ** a ** ther . 
  \u00d6 does n't really have an english equivalent, 
  so it 's two syllables ?
