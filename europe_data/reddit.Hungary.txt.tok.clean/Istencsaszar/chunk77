  spaniards have a much larger economic and cultural basis behind them . 
  obviously , like for any diverse region , the best is to be ruled by a government that is n't tied to any nationality more than to others . 
  this is why i 'm an eu federalist ... ( and also only support basque independence as within the eu , naturally ), 
  because of the two nationalisms , the basque one is way less dangerous to the diversity in the region . 
  the nationalist establishment in western europe is cancerous as a whole anyway , so something that challenges that is a welcome thing to me . 
  great tbh . 
  as much as i support their cause , killing innocent people is not okay . 
  til hungary has icebreakers, 
  `` the masses '' is mostly used to refer to revolutionaries , by the revolutionaries themselves, 
  so , what you 're saying is , that even though a revolution took place in hungary and the country was about to be reformed entirely , the new post-revolution social-liberal democracy * with universal voting * is still accountable for what the system they fought fiercely against did ? 
  so because the old system had discriminatory voting favoring the bourgeoisie , then the revolutionaries got rid of both the system and the discriminatory voting , now apparently the reformed regime is accountable for it ? 
  do n't you think that it 's a bit shitty for a reasoning ? 
  was romania in 1991 also responsible for ceausescu 's crimes ? 
  would you also accept it if some country invaded romania in 1991 , because ceausescu 's regime sucked ? 
  do n't think so, 
  the ethnic principle was pretty much ignored in the peace deal and romania clearly did n't act according to it . 
  as such it is hardly a justification , when in the end romania did n't uphold it itself, 
   so you think that somehow a majority of people living in transylvania wanted to stay with hungary stay with hungary and have peace versus continue the war for having romania ? 
  pretty sure yeah , most people would 've chosen peace , after you know , being at war for 4 years straight . 
  how were jews their compatriots , but the soviets ( by which you mean the russians most likely ) were n't ? 
   now ~ ~ merkel ~ ~ ** gottkanzler schulz ** is my best friend ftfy, 
  well there are very different anarchist groups . 
  communist anarchists are pretty much the opposite of anarcho-capitalists for example, 
   the romanian and the saxon people living there ? 
  yeah really ? 
  the `` romanian and saxon people '' held elections for representatives in the middle of the goddamn first world war ? 
   the decision of the population to split from opressive hungary came in 1918 . 
  interestingly , hungary became a country in 1918 ... wonder how those guys deducted in one month that hungary was ` oppressive ' , even though the social democrats ran the country who were already established as a pro-minority party ... but in one month they were n't even given a chance . 
  apparently the best time to decide that you wan na split is when the party that is well known to support your cause comes to power . 
   hungarian army invaded the territories the hungarian army did n't invade territories . 
  k\u00e1rolyi from the social democrats willfully gave up territories to the romanians in order to stop the war and show the entente that he 's willing to compromise . 
  but of course the entente did n't stop there , they were way too imperialistic to that . 
  kun b\u00e9la with his red army did counterattack , and won , but that was n't the `` hungarian army '' , it was the `` red army '' , and its purpose was not to defend hungary but to spread communism . 
  they even proclaimed the slovak communist republic . 
  who asked them to represent them exactly ? 
  yeah , those arent republics, 
  ohhhh , sorry that was a bit of a brainfart . 
  just realized that libertarian means liberal , sorry sorry, 
  libertarians only want to abolish borders for goods , not for people, 
  thats not a source . 
  whats the name of the village ? 
  also , its very likely that people in remote villages didnt have much of a sense of nationality and werent committed either way . 
  they were probably almost all bilingual as well , due to frequent interactions with each other . 
  idk , all i know is that in almost every election there was this `` romanian national party '' , that got 2-3 % each election . 
  which to me looks like those are the separatist-ish romanians . 
  they didnt vote against it . 
  thats the thing . 
  the minorities voted for the party that did magyarization . 
  and yes i would mind the centralization , much like i already fucking loathe it in hungary , but otherwise no , dont care . 
  slovakia , the fact that its there doesnt bother me , but if you look at their language laws you can see that they were inspired a lot by magyarizarion . 
  they have their own version of lex apponyi in place right now as well . 
  and no , theyre not more democratic than hungary at all, 
   yeah believe it . 
  why would i ? 
  a massive 2-3 % of hungary 's inhabitants voted for the romanian national party in elections . 
  which is nowhere near the amount of romanians ( 15 % ) . 
   so minorities could vote against magyarization . 
  minorities actually did n't vote against magyarization most of the time . 
  they could 've voted some other people into office , but they did n't . 
  the same right-wing party was in office for most of the dual monarchy 's time , while the minorities ' parties got 2-3 % each . 
   occupying foreign lands and subduing the people is fine because they can vote ? 
  that was czechoslovakia 's and romania 's reasoning . 
  and yes , it is . 
  you are exactly as free as citizen , regardless of what the country you live in is called , in a democracy . 
  i do n't even understand what 's so hard to understand here . 
   almost all romanians did yeah i can hardly believe that  why would hungarians invade something that isnt theirs ? 
  why would romanians invade something that isnt theirs ? 
   transylvania today would be an independent state and transylvania would be a million times better off that way . 
  but for some reason diverse regions like transylvania are not well kept when nationalism comes and wipes out diversity . 
  ( both hungary and romania are guilty of this ), 
   territory annexed by romania : 103000 km ^ 2  current territory of hungary : 93000 km ^ 2, 
  some romanians did , yeah . 
  some hungarians would also be crazy enough to wish for hungary to invade romania , would that justify an invasion ? 
  of course not, 
  i 'm fairly sure that most people just wanted peace at that point and could n't care less about which country the peace is in . 
  literally edited by a few random people , * after romania occupied the place * . 
  no one asked the romanians to invade , especially not anything resembling a democratic institution , that 's just something that you 'll have to admit, 
  provide a source . 
   70 % of the population of transylvania wanted to unite with romania source, 
   what exactly does the democracy bring to the minorities when everything is decided by foreign majority anyway . 
  you could apply this to any group of people who do n't make up 50 % of the country ... what does democracy mean for pensioners , when everything is decided by the non-pensioner majority ? 
  there is n't much of a difference with authoritarianism ? 
  yes there is a huge difference , it 's ignorant to think that it 's not . 
  minorities had the right to vote exactly as did hungarians . 
   democracy , in a modern context means something completely different  a system of government by the whole population ** or all the eligible members of a state ** , typically through elected representatives . 
  oxford dictionaries to the rescue ^, 
  by that logic ancient athens also was n't a democracy either , but that 's where the damn word and the very idea of democracy comes from . 
   the ethnic romanian majority to decide to unite with romania they have the right to do that , what they do n't have the right to is to start wars , to force hungarians into it , etc etc. 
  you can make the argument the same as with crimea , do you respect the rights of russians in crimea to unite with russia ? 
  sure , but invading is not okay in any case, 
  so hungarians just shoved 4 million romanians under the rug ? 
   and how many romanians ? 
  2.8 million ( 54 % ) , as i already said it twice in different comments . 
  transylvania 's romanian population was like britain 's pro-brexit population ... sure sure a majority but uhhhh ... should n't really draw widescale conclusions off that, 
  irredentism is pretty much the basis of nationalism , so not surprising really ... 
   it would be a french like `` egalite , fraternite '' thingy it was actually a french-esque thing in exactly that . 
  magyarization was also just a copy of the [ french practice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vergonha ), 
   and then there was a vote the vote was actually before , but it was literally 10-ish people from each nation pretending to represent it ... it was a vote only in name , it was n't even on a concrete territory for gods sake, 
  if there 's one thing i hate in the world it 's nationalism . 
  which , like it or not , includes romanian irredentism of the time .
