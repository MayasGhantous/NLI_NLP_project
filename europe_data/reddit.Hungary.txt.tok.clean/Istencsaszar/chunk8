  poland . 
  im not homogay but im accused by evil secret homo russia . 
  nah i think we 're both smartasses :\\ ^ d, 
  i stared at your comment for a minute to figure out whether you meant i am the smartass or you ... 
  ok thats cool , i just thought id tell you because you told me too, 
  tell me to stop if youre offended though , i almost feel bad for sending these xd, 
  what did the poor kids and animals do to you to deserve this kind of discrimination ? 
   i 'll bite that ass you show me  oh so youre into * that * kind of stuff , 
  if i was offended i 'd follow the manly macho tradition of posting long ass butthurt comments :3 , 
  what ? 
  you leave my motorcycle out of this, 
  ha , you cant outsmart my ass , silly girl :p, 
  what do you mean by `` didnt save it '' ? 
   is n't that thread about dirty words ? 
  it is , so i delivered :p lol then you were embarrassed that you delivered , now youre proud about it again . 
  hungarian redditors will understand it though . . edit :  i tricked him , come into my nest little one ... . lolololol wait what ? 
  done . 
  probably noone have seen it , in my experience people rarely follow these kind of conversations . 
  one sec ill edit it out . 
  no one followed the conversation this long probsbly, 
  huh , til, 
  i assumed you were a man because you made a joke about < censored  . 
  one rarely hears women doing that lol, 
  strange , we eat them all year round . 
  oh so youre a woman lol men may not make sense from a woman 's perspective . 
  just like women dont make any from ours :p, 
  winter foods ? 
  lol makes sense :d, 
  no lol . 
  ikr means `` i know right ? '', 
  i actually was thinking about the implications but i was like fuck it and sent the reply lol, 
  estonia : finno-ugric bros , wannabe nordic latvia & lithuania : the countries that prevent you getting a 5 on geography tests :( lithuania is also known for the polish lithuanian commonwealth, 
  ` ap\u00e1d fasza ' as well , ` your dads dick ' , it pairs well with ` any\u00e1d pics\u00e1ja ' , ` your moms pussy ' . 
  croatian - pi\u010dku , hungarian - picsa . 
  hehe . 
  agreed, 
  we have it on 6th december, 
  you missed out on a lot then xd, 
  yeah it means table . 
  there are other false friends with swedish though , such as in hungarian ` igen ' means ` yes ', 
  t\u00f6lt\u00f6tt paprika is good too . 
  and t\u00far\u00f3s t\u00e9szta with a lot of bacon . 
  no , sorry : / but i 'm sure if you search ` goulash recipe ' you 'll find good stuff . 
  those guys are hungarian too . 
  sz\u00e9kelys are kind of different , but then the thing would be called ` sz\u00e9kely ' instead of ` erd\u00e9lyi ' . 
  i think atleast, 
  glista is not unpronounceble at all , but hungarian is notorious for not liking more than 1 consonant to start a word . 
  so we have iskola instead of skola , asztal instead of stol , etc. 
  you guys seriously need more vowels . 
  i think it 's hungarian , we have ` rakott kelk\u00e1poszta ' here in hungary too, 
  you ca n't get guly\u00e1s from over the border though ? 
  poor guys : l, 
  you 'd be butthurt too though if you lived in hungarian transylvania . 
  dude , empathy is king , realize these people are like romanians were before trianon . 
   ofc the romas steal everything and the germans always try to cut the public spending . 
  / s no wonder why the country is shit, 
  lol no , i 'm interested in whether others like our traditional foods . 
  jeez, 
  basically , yes . 
  that 's nokedli . 
  t\u00far\u00f3 and tejf\u00f6l are good stuff . 
  especially tejf\u00f6l , we put that thing on everything , even spaghetti lol . 
  i was honestly surprised when i learned that tejf\u00f6l was n't everywhere in the world . 
  for me it always seemed so basic , like bread and meat . 
  yeah those are great  cold gy\u00fcm\u00f6lcsleves is good except when it 's so terribly cold that it hurts your teeth ... 
  warm gy\u00fcm\u00f6lcsleves exists too , but it 's kind of meh . 
  what about k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs ? 
  not surprising . 
  so could i :d, 
  try it its very good . 
  same here . 
  the help money you get for like 4 children is almost minimal wage , and it 's pretty common in roma families to have that many, 
  ` gulya ' is an old word for a pack of cows . 
  a ` guly\u00e1s ( fi\u00fa ) ' is a guy who handles these cows . 
  so ` guly\u00e1sleves ' means ` soup of the guly\u00e1s 's ' . 
  jeez , dude , chill . 
  im saying that a lot of romas dont want to be employed . 
  and no im not saying all hungarians want to either , theres a bunch of fucktards who are like that as well ( we call them ` sutty\u00f3 ' ) . 
  these guys do not want jobs , they want to continue their lives as is . 
  everyone else is blind, 
  worm , but its the diminutive ` cute ' word for it . 
  we have 2 other words for worm , ` giliszta ' which is kind of neutral and ` f\u00e9reg ' which is aggressive and is an insult too, 
  greek mythology is fucked up . 
  full of incest and rape . 
  romas are not like germans . 
  they live isolated from the others and they have been living in a society where stealing is perfectly acceptable . 
  they dont want to work , as they can live from what they steal . 
  also t\u00far\u00f3 rudi . 
  its fucking delicious . 
  obvious, 
  i 'm not saying nobody did so but definitely a lot less children were named adolf, 
  its not a shame . 
  its like after hitler no one wanted to call their kids ` adolf ' . 
  they dont want to be associated with it, 
  no it was like , life and stuff . 
  in hungary if you didnt do anything specifically against the state you were pretty much fine during communism . 
  muslim would be enough , so turkey could do it but they 're more interested in killing the kurds, 
   each and every single one it turned out to become a nightmare actually , no . 
  hungary was pretty okay especially the late 1970s and the 1980s, 
  german efficiency at its finest,
