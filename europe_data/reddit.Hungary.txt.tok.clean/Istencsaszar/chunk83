  we could just use `` o '' only , and then do n't have to deal with bullshit like szimf\u00f3nikus / szimfonikus and others . 
  i thought we gave croatia full autonomy in 1868 ? 
  anyway , i also think the whole minority oppression thing was the only bad thing about it . 
  i would say that it even could 've functioned well with the right policy towards minorities . 
  too bad franz was more preoccupied with warmongering than with the nationalities , and the hungarian authorities did n't think much of it either . 
  that is something i learned while reading that famous poem battle on / r/askreddit, 
  by the way , it might just be me , but i think we could just as well spell everything without using those . 
  only '' \u00e1 \u00e9 \u00f6 \u00fc '' would do imho, 
   \u0107 -  basically the same thing as \u010d , a bit softer ( do n't ask why , even we 're not really sure ) this is btw why in hungarian croatian/serbian names ending in - i\u0107 are written in various ways . 
  most common is - ics or - its but - ity also exists , which is pronounced differently usually . 
  ( ty usually denotes a soft t like in russian or czech \u0165 ), 
  ... said the frenchman while eating snails, 
  probably romania is better than the uk , but obviously the uk is n't the least democratic country in europe ... russia and belarus are obviously worse . 
  buzzwords . 
  both of those actually hurt countries , especially rural areas . 
  looks like a typical `` more centralization '' type of thing to me , but i might be wrong . 
  from a scientific viewpoint , what is called language and what is just a dialect is completely arbitrary . 
  way too long , just say yugo . 
  we usually use \u03c6 for random angles though, 
   a federal eu would be a nation state or not ? 
  if not , what is the difference ? 
  there is a subtle difference , but an important one i believe . 
  if it was going to be a nation-state , then the constitution would have something like this : `` the european union is about the european nation '' . 
  if it was n't , it would have something like : `` the european union is about the well-being of it 's citizens . 
  it does acknowledge that the citizens form nations and ensures the nations ' cultural autonomy '' ... 
  the difference is that the first one encourages everyone to give up their national identity ( which wo n't happen i think ) , the other encourages people to keep them but still respect the eu as their country and trust it with governance . 
  and this latter i think would create a more stable union . 
  this way there would be less nationalistic separatism . 
  the uk did n't though . 
  but anyway , austria-hungary was only supranational in the aspect of the two main nationalities , and it worked wonderfully between those two . 
  the good effects of it are still very much detectable between the two nations . 
  compare to the nations that broke off because of nationalism , there 's still a lot of hate between those countries and hungary for example , about austria well they just deported all of the ` undesirable ' german populations , so that did n't work out well either . 
  the whole supranational thing was a positive for austria-hungary , but we only did it with the two nations . 
  the ussr was only supranational in name , it pretty obviously was mostly about russians , same with yugoslavia and serbs . 
  the thing is though is that i 'm an eu federalist and so i 'd need a bit of an international background to support such a party . 
  i 'm sure people would vote for that though . 
  international stuff is always regarded higher than hungarian stuff in my experience . 
  or belgium or spain or the uk ... oh wait . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ ^ was ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ joke, 
  probably gon na start my own rather than vote for those guys, 
  or look at belgium , say , where there is n't much conflict between the two nations anymore . 
  see , as nationalism died down , even ira and eta stopped and now things are way more peaceful . 
  why ? 
  because nationalism got weaker . 
  not because these nations still do n't feel different , they do , it 's just that nationalism , as in , the feeling of always needing a nation-state for yourself , is starting to go away . 
  for who ? 
  there is no party i agree with , no party i would want to see governing . 
  none . 
  finally someone got the reference . . 
  that is a very western european view there . 
  eastern europeans i think would say , and i think its accurate there as well , that nationalism came to be because the dumbass world powers systematically oppressed their minorities and didnt give them a chance to live in peace . 
  different viewpoints i guess, 
  that people will fight for whatever shit they feel like fighting for ? 
  austria hungary was hungarys golden age . 
  hungary was never successful on its own after that , unsurprisingly, 
  see austria hungary was mainly my point, 
  those guys are not here for the reason nationalism came to dominate europe . 
  in the 1800s there was no immigration , those guys mainly are against them . 
  pan european nationalism is also nationalism . 
  and no , the reasons nationalism came to be are gone . 
  no one discriminates people in their own countries based on their nationality anymore . 
  we 've only had actual voting for like 20 years . 
  the higher turnout probably was because people did n't realize quickly that it 's pointless . 
  or somebody convinced them with big words ( the process some people call ` peasant blinding ' ) and voted for some populist, 
  well yeah sure , but the people who pretend to think like me do n't have a chance of winning so whatever ... 
  what 's the difference between fillon and macron btw ? 
  which one is the more pro-eu ? 
  none of the parties does anything really ( except steal public funds ) , so what 's the point of voting then ? 
  nationalism was also instituted over dead bodies, 
  what about ** f ** ederal ** e ** uropean ** c ** ommon ** k ** ingdom ? 
  i 'm normally opposed to monarchies but anything for a dank meme, 
  this . 
  nationalism and nationstates are the ideal of the 1800s . 
  and it 's time to move on already . 
   sovereign nations it 's always better to be part of a larger bloc than independent but a shithole . 
  always . 
  just make sure there 's autonomy . 
  yes , but not like the us . 
  especially not the names ( united states of europe sounds dumb ) , and not the whole bullshit around it either . 
  the thing is , that 's what they wish for their children . 
  clearly they deserve something worse than that ... 
  nice job there anti-vaxxers . 
  fuck those people . 
  seriously . 
  fuck them . 
  they deserve the worst, 
  the tech innovation isnt exactly hitlers idea . 
  in what way would hitler be revolutionary ? 
  killing others and viewing others as inferior was not a new idea at all, 
  fucking ghana is ahead of us . 
  seriously . 
  what the fuck, 
  theres like a million different far left ideologies . 
  look them up, 
   slavs  romania umm, 
  sure , they are . 
  but they are n't equally bad, 
  there 's a difference between hating people for their choices and hating them for stuff they ca n't do anything about, 
  i 'm sorry but what i said is accurate . 
  left does mean the more revolutionary , ergo progressive way while right is the traditionalist , conservative .
