  they do n't have to be hungarian for that . 
  for example pretty sure everyone knows that damjanich was serbian , yet no one cares . 
  `` you 're not allowed to criticize anything because your country does x '' ... 
  by inside the country i think they mean the traditional borders . 
  i mean i do n't think most people think of the same thing when someone is born in kom\u00e1rno or in shanghai . 
  okay i ran out of latin phrases . 
  nice chain though, 
  ratio educationis, 
  not british english though . 
  i do the second one all the time, 
  i think it accurately represents that dutch people do n't really know where that blob is and/or do n't care, 
  do n't need to know latin , just the specific words, 
   comparing the slovenian and croatian version of the description on the air freshener i always tried to find the words i recognize from hungarian and always found out that the slavic variants are fucking unpronounceable . 
  also , american english usually does n't merge `` got '' and `` gotten '' , unlike most british variants, 
  tfw nobody will ever understand your language, 
  it 's always like in german `` gro ** \u00df ** '' . 
  never like '' ** s ** auer '' . 
  the latter sound is written with a simple ` z ', 
  hogy means `` that '' , and gondol means `` to think '' :p give up , you 'll never just look at it and understand . 
  we wo n't let you be able to do that :p, 
  i highly doubt that they would be common enough to imply that it was the thing that replaced traditional religion there . 
  the sz is just a normal / s / sound . 
  what we spell `` s '' is pronounced like an `` sch '' in german, 
  they do n't in hungary , and i 'm pretty sure that hungary is culturally way closer to czechia than sweden . 
  nice . 
  always nice to see religion going away, 
  pretty sure they do n't, 
  that 's the coast of california your picture is showing, 
  so is this what western europe is like ? 
  people are worried about the poor poor state 's feelings ? 
   no budapest jesus christ guys , do something . 
  budapest 's protest scene is really going down the shitter these days, 
  is that the area where the island of great britain will be transferred when it leaves the eu ? 
  yeah since like what , 70 years ? 
  in what way does an eu referendum give away sovereignty ? 
  the eu constitution restricts the eu and refers to the eu , not any of the member states, 
  doesnt matter . 
  its the eus constitution , not the member states ' . 
  if they would like to continue with a constitutionless eu , then they can at any time leave and make their own unconstitutional eu, 
  holy crap we actually managed to grow compared to budapest . 
  damn, 
  i do n't really understand the whole country-based thinking . 
  fidesz and orban should lose their right yes , hungary shouldnt, 
   europe is n't a country and then what ? 
  you can make it a country in a day at this point . 
  just write that eu constitution already, 
  well , any ultras , not just the football ones, 
  hungary is definitely way more . 
  losses are often cited as 1 million , which would be more than 10 % . 
  does this count with the 1939 ( or 1941 ) area of hungary as a starting point ? 
   well centralisation does n't mean thart the power is close to you . 
  you seem to imply that decentralization would mean that though . 
  it does n't , it 's just that you 're governed from a different distant place . 
  so basically , no difference, 
  that 's just not the same, 
  well that makes no sense . 
  most people will be governed from far away anyway, 
  no , its where protests are held, 
  pls do it quick, 
  oh yeah , like , the parliament `` elects '' the president . 
  that counts as an election these days ? 
  hungary , presidential elections ? 
  what ? 
  thats the eurozone not the eu, 
  who told you that ? 
   did they have much support from rural areas too probably . 
  the thing is , you do n't protest in rural areas . 
  it 's absolutely useless . 
  if you want change , you have to go to budapest to protest an help the locals . 
  this is pretty fucked up , but that 's how fucking budapest-centered this country is . 
  and of course the budapest-centered political elite is n't exactly in a rush to change that . 
  so in short : probably rural voters were there in budapest, 
   and 170k is a lot for a country that is hungary 's size so like ... what is he thinking ? 
  that was a different guy , gyurcs\u00e1ny . 
  he was just as bad though , less authoritarian but he compensated with other things . 
  there were protests with 150k-ish people under orb\u00e1n as well though , so the point stands . 
  for comparison , the 1956 revolution topped at about 200k protesters , although at the time hungarys population was lower . 
  you learn something everyday :p, 
  eh , you can get used to it , 
   odessa oblast i think you just mean the budjak . . 
  yeah , we had protests way bigger than that against orban as well . 
  he just does n't give up this easy . 
  there are some people who just look at the flair and judge by that . . 
  i have him tagged as a nationalist as well , and it seems like i was n't wrong when i did that, 
  i ca n't change that , i do n't live in budapest, 
  why would you give the area to slovakia , who clearly do n't have any idea how to treat minorities ? 
   last sunday we had the biggest protest ever it was still pretty small compared to what usually goes on in hungary . 
  in 2006 there were * those * protests against a similarly shitty guy as orban , 170k people , literally sieged the state tv 's building and some drunk protester stole a tank as well . 
  nothing happened . 
  does n't even sound bad at all . 
  last time they were in power we were a world power , sooo ... 
  if you removed zakarpattia ( for totally no reason at all ) it would look even better, 
  why the fuck would we do that ? 
  where would we get cheap prostitutes from then ? 
  and cigarettes ? 
  huh ? 
  well did n't he work in zagreb and budapest a lot ? 
   slovakia count as separate state ( created in 1 january 1993 ) there was a slovakia around 1939-1945 too ( sort of ), 
  or europe, 
   nazism will inevitably be automated one day and this is how bender from futurama was born,
