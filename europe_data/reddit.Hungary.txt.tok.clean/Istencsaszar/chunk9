  i loled way too hard when she said ` yo motherfuckers ', 
  yes it is because in hungarian we dont use acronyms as words . 
  definitely harder than `` nagybritannia '' or `` anglia '', 
  [ relevant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bicycle_infantry ), 
  `` white russia '', 
  whats the problem though ? 
  or they just want to be orthodox because heritage ? 
  i personally would declare myself catholic even though i dont believe in god . 
   stop having better reputation, 
  or 1956 for that matter . 
  it was funny the first or second time but its way too overused : s, 
  red is human blood and green is alien blood . 
  also , nice username, 
  actually her\u00e9d would be in that too, 
  typical anybody though . 
  i dont see why it would bother anybody that i prefer using the american spelling, 
  who cares though ? 
  tata is the ~ ~ second ~ ~ third funniest town name in hungary ( after bugyi and porn\u00f3ap\u00e1ti ), 
  no i distinctly remember that on the latvian flag the blood was dried out . 
  it comes from the colors of the coat of arms . 
  to be honest the coat of arms could make a much more interesting story in case of hungary , as the `` designing '' of the flag was basically putting the colors of the coa on a tricolor , meaning was only associated with the colors later . 
  ( red - blood spilled in battles , white - freedom , green - land ) . 
  iirc in case of the latvian flag the blood dried up and made this dank burgundy color . 
  ( latvian flag best color btw ),

  how do they think they can kick out minorities though ? 
  and why do they think they have the right to ? 
  not surprising tbh . 
  bolsheviks were rebels , so they recognized a fellow rebel country . 
  similar situation with today , such as abkhazia and transnistria recognize each other . 
  i 'm not really complaining . 
  i personally have no problem with the current situation , for me it 's completely fine . 
  what i was saying was the hungarians who do n't live in hungary will inevitable think they are `` victims '' of trianon , because they will see themselves as hungarians who just so happen to live in a different country . 
  by the `` no fault of their own '' i meant they have to live in a society that will ( or at least a lot them will ) see them as foreign , while they are infact native to the area . 
  i get all this , i know these are problems . 
  ( although its hard to completely avoid victimization when 1 out of 5 hungarians live in neighboring countries through no fault of their own - dont get me wrong i 'm not saying they are , but try telling them ) what i 'm saying is that it 's really insane to automatically assume we were gon na betray them if we were allied . 
  an alliance is something that both sides agree upon , aka the hungarians too agree to cooperate and help . 
  assuming we would do that is ridiculous, 
  ofc , that 's probably biologically impossible for a human anyway - he would unconsciously vomit . 
  ( unless he was really a vampire ), 
  i like how you just assume that hungary will betray if allied because a bunch of nationalist dicks are wanting to revise trianon . 
  we have sane people here too, 
  because norway and russia have a land border ... ? 
  language ? 
  what, 
  yet you cant make propaganda out of thin air . 
  you can exaggerate ( which happened here probably ) , this does n't change that vlad did kill approximately 40k to 100k people, 
  i would take something similar if it gave me steam money . 
   aversion to spicy food . 
  what the fuck did you just fucking say about me , you little bitch ? 
  i 'll let you know that in here in hungary we have this magic thing called `` er\u0151s pista '' ( `` spicy steve '' ) of which you could n't survive a drop , we put that shit on any food like americans do ketchup . 
  nutella is love , nutella is life, 
  he also put his enemies dead bodies to the dining table and ate next to the dissolving human remains . 
  theres a [ drawing ( nsfl ) ] ( http://www.livescience.com/images/i/000/071/430/i02/impaled.jpg?1414193237 ) about it from the time , so i assume its not far off of the real thing . 
  theres a lot of them around . 
  in my hometown ( 70k residents ) theres like 3 of them , i imagine budapest has a lot too , 
  love you too . 
  ( we 're working on it dont ^ tell ^ anyone ^ please ), 
  i was pretty sure too  it was just my immature mind that associated that thumbs with . . uh , something else with similar shape so for me it came out pretty weird . 
  : l. i guess i 'm just weird . 
  i know but . . 
  i dont know its weird, 
  what the fuck is that ? 
   until 1989 , the russian language was compulsory in ~ ~ czechoslovakia ~ ~ eastern bloc schools . 
  ftfy, 
  ace or kick, 
  especially impressive knowing that 30 years ago even food was luxury there . 
  big thumbs up for romania , 
  in hungary the biology classes cover the biology-related stuff . 
  ( aka , penis and vagina and menstruation , orgasm , etc. ), 
  and theres a dedicated sex ed class ( which is held separately for boys and girls ) which is about protection . 
  yes , to be honest it should be a part of biology lessons instead of its own . 
  oh shit that means hungary is in the balkans ? 
  sure , what i dont like about nationalism is the idea to have one country per nation and one nation per country . 
  this is just not possible no matter how hard you try . 
  yeah that is true : / hungarians had this idea back then that everything within the carpathian basin is hungary . 
  and nationalism ( which i hate btw ) taught them that what is hungary belongs to the hungarians ( which is stupid aswell , and tbh it sounds like hitler 's lebensraum a little bit ) . 
  ugh , well , the revolution in wien was a different revolution . 
  and yes we passed the april laws but the point of it was really to fuck austrians , they simply pretended minorities dont exist . 
  if they fought on our side for the independence of uhry then we could probably have won against austria . 
  and also the attitudes towards them couldve shifted . 
  i only read the title, 
  what did austria promise to you ? 
  `` if '' unfortunately does n't exist in history , though . 
  if austria did n't promise stuff to minorities in uhry history could 've gone completely different . 
  after all the revolution of 1848 was started by a slovak-hungarian guy to free a slovak-croat guy from the habsburg prison , and a lot of minorities fought in the wars against austria , many of them are national heroes today . 
   u\u017ehorod deportation was thing of cccp . 
  i know  it was not so funny that one family may have been slovaks preaponyi , magyars after , slovaks after ww i , magyars ww ii and slovaks after . 
  yeah that is pretty bad . 
  even worse that it probably happened a lot . 
  it was even worse in k\u00e1rp\u00e1talja / zakarpattia where in the last 100 the area went from austria-hungary to czechoslovakia to slovakia ( ? ), 
  to hungary then to the ussr then to ukraine . 
  all that in a single lifetime of a person  the thing was that germans betrayed the shit out of us pre ww ii and magyars were somehow natural choice too . 
  yeah in wwii both germany and hungary wanted to revise the post-wwi treaties because neither country thought they were fair . 
  by [ slovakization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slovakization ) i meant the czechoslovak deportations and stuff . 
  i know today they have all the rights and stuff , i 've been there , i saw it  ( atleast in rimavsk\u00e1 sobota/rimaszombat ) . 
  i also knew about the hungarian parties . 
   slovakia got maybe 500k of romas hungary also has like 500k :p they do n't really seem to integrate , though : /  my grandfather was born in ujpest , later adopted by his uncle , magyar army officer . 
  served on eastern front , flak .
