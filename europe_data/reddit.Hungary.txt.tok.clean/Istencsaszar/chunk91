  just above shoulder , well i would n't call that short personally , mainly because only call it short or long when its unexpectedly short or long , when it 's something really out of the ordinary . 
  just above shoulder is a pretty common sight , so i 'd just call it normal, 
  yeah well as for womens ' short hair , i think it can be done well , but under a certain length it 's basically impossible for it to look good . 
  i meant like , short hair never not be at least acceptable, 
   with ~ ~ wwii ~ ~ nationalism ftfy, 
   fapping to fully clothed women with no cleavage either [ mfw ] ( https://media.tenor.co/images/37b281476eaf1783be90c251c7045919/raw ), 
  ... for men that is, 
  nothing like getting your argument ignored and being called names . 
  no , im not an irredentist . 
  nor am i a nationalist . 
  you however , are both of those things , as such its pretty hard to take you seriously anymore, 
   what gives hungary rights over transylvania ? 
  nothing , the exact same thing that gave romania rights over transylvania back in the day you can find ethnic regions of the desired majority , every heard of gerrymandering ? 
  applying the same logic , hungary is n't united today -  welcome to jobbik territory, 
  you did n't even read what i replied to , did you ? 
  i replied to the guy who claimed that romania was n't `` really united '' united before 1918 . 
  yay , nationalism, 
   the americans and british + colonies won the war alone there is no way western europeans actually believe that ... right ? 
  guys ? 
   romanian posts jobbik-tier shit  legit complaints  `` ohhhhh me god them hungarians sooo salty nationalist fucks '' ok then, 
  jesus fucking christ dude . 
  was america also not unified in 1776 because some places werent included that are now ? 
  relevant username, 
  * cigars, 
   we will focus far more on old friends and new allies than we would have were we going to stay way to say nothing with lots of words, 
  / r/corruption _ irl, 
  hungary 's is n't, 
   p\u00e1linka  anywhere outside hungary triggered, 
  eh ... it 's okay i guess, 
  palinka is literally made for that . 
  to keep you warm, 
  now * that * is a beautiful city, 
  every time i see a body of people like that i am reminded of that poem from 1848 where the sea of the people washes the system away, 
  also , `` nazis good '', 
  rekt, 
  both are actually . 
  yeah me too , but accidents happen , even `` accidents '' that are planned by the woman . 
   uifal\u0103u hm , sounds like it would be '' \u00dajfal\u00f3 '' in hungarian that way ( which is possible , who knows what the local dialect sounded like ) . 
   virtually nobody knows it in oradea yeah well a similar thing is happening with hungarian placenames the other way round . 
  although they are somewhat better preserved here , as everyone learns history and they only use the hungarian names there . 
  also maps , maps often do n't even bother writing out the romanian names, 
   refined population yes hungary has always been incredibly refined . 
  even today . 
  just look at this [ refined sense of music ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij4rio4wl4g&amp;ab_channel=rolandalf%c3%b6ldi ), 
   locals call it ujfalu only just as they say ladany only . 
  yeah yeah when a town name has a recognizable prefix it 's always omitted in hungarian . 
  i 've even heard `` gom '' for `` esztergom '' . 
  but the fun is when you pronounce the whole thing  much more comical, 
  now , now . 
  here in hungary you are n't called gypsies . 
  you are called romanians , which is way worse an insult ;p ^ ^ ^ ^ ( / s ), 
  tbh i 've never even been to that county , the whole alf\u00f6ld really ( i 'm not a fan of the whole flat plains thing ) , so i kinda just guessed what it must be like . 
  but with that fucking name , you must mention it . 
  seriously , * beretty\u00f3\u00fajfalu * ... ( no offense to anyone from there btw ), 
  you might be inclined to think that , but have you ever seen the glory of such vibrant urban centers of west bihar like beretty\u00f3\u00fajfalu ? 
  moldova as well, 
  ca n't you disown a baby or something along those lines anyway ? 
  hungary as well . 
  interestingly it was a woman who banned abortions altogether here ( anna ratk\u00f3 ) . 
  as such our `` baby boomers '' are called `` ratk\u00f3 's babies '', 
  to tell the whole truth though , the other half of the bihor/bihar region is in hungary , as part of hajd\u00fa-bihar county . 
  nice username, 
  / r/hailcorporate, 
   in that case , no one would ever be able to say anything about any country . 
  yeah , that is about right . 
  dont label countries in ways you can label people , because countries arent people . 
  `` i know some hungarians , therefore i am validated to put a label on them , even though as i just said i didnt meet most of them '' isnt this the very mentality you just said is more common among hungarians , except with gypsies ? 
  youre the living example, 
  i disagree . 
  i think hungary is in general way way less religious than the us . 
  i do n't think anyone really about the anthem anymore . 
  it 's definitely not viewed as moral guidance that 's for sure, 
  countries are n't people, 
  not killing each other is a wonderful start , agreed . 
   the icty indictment reads that milo\u0161evi\u0107 was responsible for the forced deportation of 800,000 ethnic albanians from kosovo , and the murder of hundreds of kosovo albanians and hundreds of non-serbs in croatia and bosnia . 
  wikipedia . 
  i still find it hard to believe he was innocent, 
  kosovos provocations are also stupid , you think i 'm implying they 're not ? 
   you apparently have a knack to compare serbs and serbia to nazis i did n't even say the words serbs or serbia , and even argued that national interests do n't exist . 
  i talked only about individuals . 
  i ca n't imagine how deeply ingrained your nationalism must be , to project like this . 
  `` this guy condemned a serb ( or a group of serbs ) , he must really hate * all * serbs ''  provocate provocation is a laughably stupid thing . 
  do n't do it . 
  ever . 
  provocation is like a kindergardener 's way to do diplomacy . 
  if you dignify provocation with a response , you 're exactly as bad as they are . 
  now the question is , do you want to sink to the moral level of kosovo or not ? 
  whoops sorry , kinda confused him with karadzic , but my point still stands . 
  he had the influence to stop the killing , he did n't . 
  how would you feel about a similar personality on the croatian side ? 
  no it 's not . 
  people who kill innocents for fun include all three of hitler ustashe and slobodan . 
  supporting either one of these is basically equivalent . 
   are you comparing serbia to hitler ? 
  no , i simply pointed out similarities in the * reasoning * for war crimes , not the actual extent of them . 
   national interests are political goals a country tries to accomplish , or stances that a government takes . 
  you ca n't seriously think that political goals are not made up and executed by individuals . 
  they might not be for individual gains ( which is rare , but good ) , but they still are goals of individuals or small groups perhaps , definitely not the goals of the nation or the country . 
   fights back you 're confusing fighting back with something else , because fighting back means fighting against an ongoing atrocity . 
  and no atrocity i know of is going on .
