  nice one there sherlock , nobody would 've guessed that now would they ? 
  nice !, 
  i did n't expect any good post to come out of this trend , but op was here to prove me wrong, 
  they do n't have an opt out, 
  but that 's hungary fam, 
  i do n't see your point ? 
  that 's how any normal country works ... even today 's netherlands . 
   than on the electorate hold up a minute , why did n't they just give the indonesians voting rights and shit ? 
   hating the fact that you 're part of it somehow because nothing ever came * here * of that money i paid in . 
  most of it should go to help the shittier ares develop , yet even today there 's no developed areas other the budapest . 
  those cunts in the parliament just take most of the money , and the minimal amount that remains after corruption is still only spent for budapest . 
  the system works incredibly badly , which is why i hate it . 
  the principle i 'm not opposed to , just the fact that it 's not working the way it should be, 
  germany is n't . 
  [ we ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union ) are, 
  the short ' \u00e1 ' like in `` sv ** \u00e1 ** jc '' , or sometimes `` h ** a ** ll\u00f3 '', 
  alright , thanks for the info, 
  i mean the huns one was pretty understandable too . 
  i would 've done the same thing, 
  the romans also plundered lots and lots of artifacts . 
  ever heard of this city called carthage ? 
  what about vk for example ? 
  no , it just means that the kids did n't write the tests as good . 
  it tells nothing about the actual abilities of anyone . 
  it tells you that the kids did n't care enough to write it well , for which i ca n't blame them : they have absolutely no motivation to do so, 
  hungarian has depending on dialect 14-16 vowels and 0-2 diphthongs , but only 24 consonants . 
   education is how you get out of poverty no , it 's education * and * migrating to somewhere where you have better options with your education . 
  you sell your daughter , get money for it . 
  it makes perfect sense . 
  not surprising that poor people who do n't give a fuck about women 's rights would do that : they ca n't afford to let the daughter decide for herself, 
  holy shit this is pathetic . 
  it 's like when jobbik assholes walk around saying `` omg we wuz huns '' and shit like that . 
   nationalism  harmless pick one, 
  but look how * civilized * they were !!! 4 !!, 
  unlike the huns , who raped , killed and enslaved hundreds of thousands of people !, 
  how does it help you tell what you 're doing wrong ? 
  i dont think they fo in other countries either . 
  so its a useless waste of time for both the students and the statisticians . 
  and the amount of attention it receives is ridiculous, 
  i participated in it last year . 
  no one takes it seriously from among the students because they have no reason to, 
  how was it stolen are you serious ? 
  you can literally see on the picture , they upgraded the road twice . 
  obviously the middle phase was unnecessary , so the money that was spent on it was wasted , aka stolen money, 
  i was just stating facts , where did i say it was a problem ? 
   or maybe you are saying that switzerland is n't `` civilized '' ? 
  you think switzerland is some wonderland where you only pay for the very roads you use all the time ? 
  wtf ? 
  no , that does n't mean i do n't pay into the budget which builds all the roads elsewhere ? 
  that is , hungary 's budget . 
  which is what i was referring to . 
  that i pay into hungary 's budget to help build roads that service other people, 
  i do n't really understand why started to talk about nations working themselves , in reply to a corruption joke but knock yourself out i guess, 
  money well stolen, 
  pisa is a joke though . 
  i would love to see less posts about it, 
   the speed limit hold up a minute , are you saying that people respect speed limits ? 
  i do n't like to either , but that 's what you get for living in a civilized country . 
  or in your weird case , the european union . 
  the situation is exactly the same within the country, 
  that is the most inaccurate map of that i 've ever seen . 
  the ural mountains do n't go down to the motherfucking steppe . 
  the border is defied with the word `` urals '' , because it refers to the ural mountains and the ural river to the south , which run several hundred kilometers to the west from your line , and therefore much much less of kazakhstan is in europe than you claim, 
  that 's a pretty stupid way to look at it . 
  modern poland also `` occupies '' poland the same way austria did parts of it back in the day, 
  that ethnic map is incredibly shitty, 
  that 's like saying that poland invaded china , because the russian empire did, 
   occupation it is not an occupation when it 's legally owned by austria, 
  and hungary took like half a million polish refugees , and rubbed in hitler 's face that we would never help invade poland, 
  he commented after the original was deleted as well, 
  but there was no austria-hungary at that time, 
  it was n't , it was about that certain countries had `` arab '' as their most searched, 
  austria-hungary existed between 1867-1919 . 
  were there partitions of poland then ? 
  when ? 
  that is one weird map . 
  the cities ' names are in completely random languages . 
  most in czech/slovak and then there 's `` munk\u00e1cs '' in hungarian and `` uzhgorod '' in russian of all things, 
  when did hungary invade poland, 
  who ? 
  i mean the real hardcore chav accent . 
  the standard british is offputting to me as well , very much so . 
  but when you get that sweet chav lower class accent , that 's wonderful in a talk-focused porn scene, 
  because did n't do anything , you realize that right ? 
  it does n't even oblige your government to even start the process of quitting . 
  which you did n't do . 
  the uk did n't quit the eu , it does n't even the show the slightest willingness to do so, 
  canadian translation : welcome to balkans , eh, 
   0 academic support well you should know that scientifically , dialect and language are n't different things . 
  so there will be no academic consensus , because that 's something academics should never get their hands into, 
  and spain too . 
  interesting to say the least, 
   it 's almost as if europe was predominantly muslim it 's almost as if europeans want to fuck muslim chicks * ca n't blame anyone for that ... 
   nsfl how would it be nsfl tho ... if you 're a fanatic catholic or something maybe ? 
  not even then, 
   what kind of barbarian savage i saw an arab immigrant friend of mine do it once ... guess i know that fence was built now, 
  the accent is what makes it worth watching, 
   they david cameron was secret ukip all along ? 
  yeah , i 'm not even sure you can translate that one right . 
  or the english one,
