  he can feel sympathy while also debating , the two things are n't mutually exclusive,

  i can get one ordered to my house for 2, 
  no i would n't assume they 're ukrainian .

  you can sympathize with anyone no matter your nationality, 
  til you cant sypathize with people unless you are one of them, 
  i remember the hungarian version which says `` weird mix of hungarians and gypsies '' for transylvania and `` mordor '' for the rest of romania, 
  no dumbass , you proved that the act of anschluss was a union like a true genius . 
  now go back to what you talked about in the first place : the third reich , which still was n't a union . 
  yes . 
  so , where 'd the third reich come in ? 
  the act of anschluss was an example of the first definition, 
   2 . yep holy fucking shit , reading comprehension .

   not giving roussillon to catalonia, 
  calling the 3rd reich a union is the dumbest thing i 've ever heard, 
  france is eastern europe now or what ? 
  if we do , we should n't, 
  no one cares about your xenophobia, 
  not that much, 
  i do n't know enough about portuguese history to be able to tell , but idk , in 1910 it definitely was with the proclamation of the national republic and stuff, 
  so , a generic nationalist . 
  still though , that is taking it to the extreme . 
  he has nothing to gain from doing this, 
  yeah , i was hesitating between that and the french revolution . 
  the springtime of nations is when it all came together for the first time . 
  why is that so important to kadyrov though ? 
  there is no way that in 1139 it was a nationstate . 
  ( btw hungary was founded in 1001 , yet it was n't a nationstate either , not until 1848 or 1867 ) . 
  probably you can also point to a date or a time period in which portugal became a nationstate, 
  ah right i see . 
  though that is still just a political thing for the elite of those countries . 
  the popular nationalist movements started much later . 
  i said it elsewhere in the thread as well , that nationalism really started in the french revolution in my opinion, 
  most american dialects i believe have `` you guys '' for that purpose . 
  as with most things , you ca n't really point to a starting point and say it clearly started . 
  it was a gradual thing , and it varied between different places as well . 
  well , there were territorially integral states before too though , such as city states, 
  portugal - flag of portugal ... yeah ? 
  okay ? 
  https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nation#english the first meaning existed only in the cultural aspects . 
  it definitely did n't acquire the second meaning , as there was no nationalism to make that happen , or to make people feel like they need one . 
  which is why i made the comment with the word nation , as the previous poster said `` spain , the nation '' . 
  which obviously only is one in the second sense , not the first one, 
  iraq and sham, 
  i did n't say nations did n't exist , i said nationalism did n't exist . 
  what ? 
  and that is why we need us-style racial segregation and stigmatization and stuff like that . 
  this is how you get racial nationalists like blm, 
  the eu is n't a nationstate ( thankfully ), 
  i would put it to the french revolution personally . 
   explain why < people have ethnicities  wow , great arguments . 
  people had ethnicity/nationality/identity before too , i did n't claim otherwise .
