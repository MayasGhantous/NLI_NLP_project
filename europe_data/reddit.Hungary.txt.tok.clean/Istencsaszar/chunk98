  i would most definitely phrase it differently , because to me , christian world and modern western world are really , antonyms, 
  i might make a version for the entire historical hungary too if thats what you want, 
  :( shame, 
  yeah well the dialects are very rare to hear these days . 
  most urban people speak the standard , unfortunately , the younger generation often speaks it with more variation than the older people in my experience, 
  yeah . 
  looks like a pretty standard western procedure to me . 
  well if you find a good source that describes what the hungarians looked like racially, 
  well both are things/stereotypes i heard and never experienced irl , so take this with a grain of salt . 
  the budapest one is the 8th district , where they say `` nyolcker/ny \u00f3cker '' , instead of `` nyolcadik ker\u00fclet '' , leaving out the ' - th ' suffix ( - adik / - edik ) . 
  and the eastern one is the ny\u00edrs\u00e9g , where apparently they dont use the cases which mean `` from '' or `` to '' a place or area . 
  so they would say `` elmentem a n\u0151v\u00e9remn\u00e9l '' ( i came at my sister 's place ) and not `` elmentem a n\u0151v\u00e9remhez '' ( i came to my sister 's place ) . 
  and yes , they pervy hidden meaning exists in humgarian too . 
  and in retrospect i couldve put in vas county too , where they `` put in '' the door and not `` close '' it . 
  ( beteszi az ajt\u00f3t / becsukja az ajt\u00f3t ) also , disclaimer , i dont think any of these are degenerate or inferior , the post is just in jest . 
  i remember from history classes there there was supposed to be a so called * \u00e9letfa * ( `` tree of life '' for foreigners ) , of which the branches were worlds and i think they believed that shamans could communicate with those in the other worlds . 
  and somehow people would travel between those when dead , and for example burying them with their stuff would give them those stuff in the other world . 
  or something like that . 
  i do n't remember mentions of any gods . 
   according to jobbik according to jobbik we 're everything but finno-ugric , that 's the main point, 
  sounds fair to me, 
  seriously , who cares about christianity ? 
  people forget that hungarians would be glorious tengri if it were n't for the stupid christians making us convert . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ \\ ( i ^ ^ ^ ^ am ^ ^ ^ ^ approaching ^ ^ ^ ^ jobbik ^ ^ ^ ^ territory , ^ ^ ^ ^ fuck ), 
   i am also being satirical . 
  i am also being satirical while saying `` salty '' . 
  it 's satire-ception at this point . 
   try crashing a village wedding or a diszn\u00f3v\u00e1g\u00e1s, 
  salty . 
  you realize that `` true catholic faith ^ tm '' is also satirical , right ? 
  they often come to hungary because they can live cheap from their pensions here , usually they buy some house in a remote village and renovate it as well . 
  they 're pretty nice as well usually . 
  and czechoslovakia and soviet union as well . 
  just took the fist map for `` hungarys counties '', 
   implying that the non-budapest cities are n't way better in every way  implying that the actual countryside does n't make the best alcohol in ~ ~ hungary ~ ~ the world, 
  because jumping on bandwagon . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xxha7pu.jpg ) an extra one so that all the right people can get offended \\ ^ \\ ^, 
  chisinau is supposed to be * kisjen\u0151 * my man, 
  guess you are just way better than oxford dictionaries or merriam-webster will ever be , right ? 
  in dutch you 're most likely right , but as i said , you are absolutely no authority over the english language . 
  i just demonstrated with sources that it ** does ** refer to country . 
  you think i do n't understand ? 
  i saw cgp grey 's condescending video too , but both it and you are approaching / r/badlinguistics territory, 
  no , it often refers to the country . 
  [ oxford dictionary ] ( https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/holland ) says holland - another name for the netherlands . 
  and [ merriam-webster ] ( https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/holland ) says `` see netherlands '' . 
  not to mention that in the oxford one , the country definition comes before the province thing as well . 
  you are the one flattering yourself , thinking you hold the authority over the whole english language , telling everyone who 's wrong and who is n't . 
  you people make me wan na stop using it the supposedly `` correct '' way just so that i 'm as annoying to you as you are being with this oversensitivity . 
  the world is n't gon na stop using it the way they have been forever because it is n't good according to your tastes . 
  and to repeat : no it 's not wrong, 
  whether it offends you or not does n't determine what is right or wrong, 
  linguistically , both are exactly right, 
  thats exactly what `` you are called that '' means, 
  he was implying the second part as well, 
  so , they chose the possibility of staying in the eu over the guaranteed being out , and now once again they chose to remain . 
   you chose which bed to lie in a few years ago when you had an independence referendum . 
  as far as i remember the indyref was influenced a lot by the fact that leaving the uk wouldve made them leave the eu, 
  you do n't have to here either, 
  yeah but you obviously do n't see it . 
  from the southern side you see the nice landscape of the north coast, 
  because i ca n't imagine why you would call a name `` dead '' . 
  was the name octavius also dead because the guy changed it for example ? 
  this `` pics of europe '' is the worst part of this sub , i would never contribute to it, 
   actually preferring the north coast fucking heretic, 
  so it 's decided by authorities and the 50 % +1 ? 
  same thing, 
  how does a name die ? 
  holy fuck , you really are going this low . 
  i said nothing even close to justifying a terrorist attack , or they deserving to die . 
  i said that ** if they joined voluntarily ** , then they the signed up the ** most deadly job in the history of mankind ** , which i would compare to something like `` jumping out the window of wtc , and then being surprised that you die in the end '', 
   '' unless they were drafted against their will ''  hurr durr well its great that you read my comments you 're replying to, 
  the fuck . 
  you know what `` what they signed up for '' means , right ? 
  it means they knew exactly that they might die with that job , that 's what . 
  no they did n't , but this is exactly what they signed up for, 
  i agree with that then . 
  i guess i just misunderstood then . 
  that said though , raiding kurdish villages looking for pkk is not okay and will just make more people join pkk, 
  that said though , unless they were drafted against their will , they are still military personnel, 
  kurdish civilians do n't kill , is what i 'm saying . 
  as such if you claim they killed people , then you 're full of shit, 
   in public was n't this against a military target ? 
  wtf . 
  civilians dont kill , that 's what makes them civilians, 
  truths are all de facto . 
  de facto it is a part of russia . 
  everything else is claims , however you look at it . 
  i do n't dispute that it * should * be part of and occupied by ukraine , but let 's not undermine the importance of facts with this counterproductive `` muh de jure '' thinking, 
  thats weird , didnt even notice at first, 
  i dont know . 
  i personally value the truth over not looking negative , and looking through that list , there are many countries that sure as hell arent developing . 
  i think its not just misleading , it is just a straight up lie, 
  yeah , but its the same reason why some people mix up eu and europe, 
  yes , this happens a lot , i know . 
  but for non-russian readers it is often more practical this way : you can zoom in better , without sacrificing too much of the important content . 
  non-russian european viewers will care about the detail in central europe more than the data for remote parts of russia . 
  not to mention that russian data is often only one data point for the entire country , or less detailed than the rest anyway . 
  not saying this is a good practice , but i can see why they do it, 
  i did n't mean in this specific case .
