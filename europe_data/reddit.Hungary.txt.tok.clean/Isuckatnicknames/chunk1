so this is my personal experience , but i am distancing myself from politics as much as possible , so be advised that it might be completely off from reality . 
  basically , from what i saw , people have this love-hate relationship with orb\u00e1n . 
  they know that he and his friends and family is gaining a lot of money form his position and such , but people also trust him not to be stupid and seriously harm the country . 
  like , there is n't a good alternative to orb\u00e1n and fidesz right now . 
  there 's jobbik , but they did some pretty right wing shit in the past . 
  i 've come to realize that even though i absolutely adore dogs , i am a full on cat person because of this . 
  i really love that loose and open relationship that cats provide over that suffocating , high maintenance ones that dogs require . 
  so when will we finally ~ ~ annex ~ ~ i mean introduce gerogia to the eu ? 
  those strategic kefir sources need to be secured from the encroaching imperialists .

  [ apparently they can be ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_lechfeld_ ( 955 ) ) b\u00e9le iv also placed heavy emphasis on knights and crossbowmen during his reign , leading up to the second mongol invasion of hungary . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_mongol_invasion_of_hungary#military_reforms ), 
  oi , those are a few centuries apart . 
   they won a lot of their battles by staying away from their enemies and peppering them with arrows until they were completely disorganised and then delivering the final blow , not just charging straight into shield walls like they do in the show . 
  hungarians used those tactics as well , iirc it was very effective for a good hundred years before the germans figured out that heavy cavalry is quite good against it . 
  huh . 
  there 's 5 million of them even . 
  unless they have millions of immigrants it would n't show up on this map . 
  the crown not wanting new clay to stick their flags in ? 
  that 's preposterous .

  i thought anatolia was still considered europe . 
  then again , they occupied the balkans for around 500 years . 
  i 'm asking * why * are they not european . 
  i get it that you can separate them by some kind of combination of their culture and origins and all that kind of stuff , but there are all kinds of things wrong with that . 
  like : * geologically speaking europe does n't exists . 
  * geographically speaking turkey is in europe . 
  * culturally speaking you could make a case that vladivostok is european . 
  * politically turkey is very much european since a few hundred years ago . 
  so i 'm just asking that what is that very weird criteria that segregates turkey from europe . 
  like , yeah i get it , they are n't european , by why are they not ? 
  i mean , there are europeans who originally came from asia and there are europeans who are muslim . 
  turkish people were also heavily involved in european politics for hundreds of years now . 
  so , why is it that you are n't european ?

  i do n't know , i 've read some about operation barbarossa and the germans had a lots of troubles . 
  they very well might have lost the war without us intervention . 
  well , yeah . 
  nations tend to ignore the parts of their history when they were the attackers . 
  that 's the same with all nations , not just the russians and soviets . 
  same with genocides and general brutality as well .

  this seems like a very convoluted plot to colonize space , form the imperium of luxemburg then unify the techno-barbarians of europe . 
  and that . 
  we have n't invaded anyone tho .
