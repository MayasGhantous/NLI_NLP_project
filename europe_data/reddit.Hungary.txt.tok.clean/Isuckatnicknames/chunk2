  we were either part of austria , or puppets of the soviets or nazis . 
  during horty 's time it was pretty much get invaded or fall in line . 
  eventually we got invaded none the less . 
  e. : sorry , i forgot about that whole communist fiasco . 
   where can you find the prettiest women in europe ? 
  eastern europe . 
  our pretty ladies were n't stolen by vikings . 
  ah yes . 
  even though the picture does n't make any sense without this or a similar title . 
  i took this in hungary actually . 
  thanks , i 'll try to remember that . 
  i really did not think that this would blow up this much . 
  wow , it made it to the top and i even got a gold out of it . 
  man , this place is weird . 
  it 's better to die for the kaiser than to live for yourself . 
  i made this photo yesterday and thought it was amusing . 
  meme it away, 
  so um , where is the line between a mediocre and a great dictatorship ? 
  yeah , as far as i know he was a mostly liked pope, 
  horse german, 
  the legend is wrong , all those places are inside the pannonian basin [ it 's more like this ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5mn5zjkiyii/uohioxfwbni/aaaaaaaaafy/dopwugk-edy/s1600/hungarian_migration-settlement.jpg ), 
  [ we were the god damn best horsemen that ever horsed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarians#entering_the_carpathian_basin_.28c._895.29 )  in 907 , the hungarians destroyed a bavarian army in the battle of pressburg and laid the territories of present-day germany , france , and italy open to hungarian raids , which were fast and devastating . 
  the hungarians defeated the imperial army of louis the child , son of arnulf of carinthia and last legitimate descendant of the german branch of the house of charlemagne , near augsburg in 910 . 
  from 917 to 925 , hungarians raided through basle , alsace , burgundy , saxony , and provence . 
  [ 44 ] hungarian expansion was checked at the battle of lechfeld in 955 , ending their raids against western europe , but raids on the balkan peninsula continued until 970 . 
  those mongolians were just some damn hipsters copying us . 
  fuck damn it . 
  russia is such a cool ass nation , why is it have to be a political shit hole . 
  hey !, 
  we are still hot blooded nomads !, 
  i even participated the 2131st pillaging of vienna this weekend !!, 
  well , damn . 
  why is that guy rubbing his nipples ? 
  you do not actually pronounce `` hogy '' as `` hoy '' . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/hungarian/comments/2yj04s/beginner_help_with_pronouncing_gy/ ) [ some ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voiced_palatal_stop ) material on it . 
  i do n't remember that episode of star trek, 
  i 've learned croatian pretty intensely ( like 4-5 hours per week ) during elementary , but never really cared enough to learn the language proper , even though in my village like everyone over 30 speaks it . 
  i come from a heavily croatian populated small village , like my grandmother learned croatian first , hungarian second type of deal . 
  i 'm around at least half ( possibly even more ) croatian actually, 
  you just jelly , because you are half the horse as we are, 
  the linguistic genocides i have to witness every single time someone tries to speak hungarian haunts my dreams . 
  btw this reminds me , how much has the macron-trudeau shipping has taken off ? 
  like can you find quality material already , or should one wait for the real good stuff ? 
  if that would have happened , we 'd be much better off economically and have far better political stability , and not have a pseudo-dictator govern us right now . 
  that 's the thing , from outside it would look okay . 
  nationalism makes sense , and it 's logical and has a deeper purpose i 'd wager , but i have never felt it , so i can not get why people would want independence if it would harm them for the sake of replacing the oppression of a foreign government with the oppression of their own . 
  i just kinda realized that the reason is probably some stupid stuff that only sociologists or psychologists can explain and has no sense whatsoever in our age . 
  because honestly from an outsiders perspective it just seems dumb . 
  like you are in a worse economic position with a more unstable government , and basically no one is going to help you ether . 
  so okay , i do not really get the sentient behind wanting to have independence from a larger governing body if that body is not heavily oppressive nor has genocidal tendencies of course . 
  why would it be good for catalonia to be an independent state ? 
  i 'm so barbaric some british guy stick a flag in my room and proclaimed it property of the crown, 
  ah yes , we all remember the great collapse of 1891 , when the world 's economy suddenly crashed , because the uk thought that destroying 90 % of the world 's dye production in favor of more tea is a good idea . 
  anarcho-liberals ? 
  god damn man , i 'd kill them all myself rather than let those deranged aberrations rule them . 
  e. : / s and grammar, 
   most people wanted to join germany ( weimar republik ) , but it was prevented by the allies . 
  have to fight that border gore mate , you can only into germany with czechia to preserve the pretty borders . 
  because this will get buried i can say it freely . 
  i have a mug with the union jack on it , and i use it to drink coffee . 
  it 's my favorite mug . 
  thank you . 
  i 'm too poor to afford proper grammar, 
  that depends , tap water is chemically treated , while mineral water ( at least in hungary ) can only be advertised and sold as mineral water if it can be consumed without chemical treatments , only ultraviolet radiation treatments and such are permitted . 
  also tap water at my place smells of sulfur . 
  do you prefer ketchup or mustard with that shoe ? 
  at least we 'll have a ~ ~ striving ~ ~ ( e. : thriving ) advertisement industry . . 
  i got it mixed up . 
  is is a fan made one . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gcybi97.png ) one is from kaiserreidh, 
  honestly after the hours i 've put into vic 2 this map just looks natural to me . . 
  at least a nicer [ flag ] ( http://pre04.deviantart.net/284f/th/pre/i/2013/070/e/f/danubian_federation_grunge_flag_by_khrysophylax-d5xr0bn.jpg ), 
  my older family members think that communism was better , but then again , that was goulash communism . . 
   hungary has one of the heaviest and most qualified warship battalion in east-central europe , only hungary operates river-based military forces of the surrounding nato-members . 
  the home defence pyrotechnician and warship battalion of the hungarian defence forces based in \u00dajpest port , on the river danube , budapest . 
  in the 2000s ( decade ) , the army bought new minesweepers , restored or retired the old ones . 
  on national holidays warships come along the river danube in budapest . 
  even we have a better naval force than you guys . 
  i think there are easier ways to get explosives than robbing a military base . 
  like it 's way too high profile and risky . 
  but then again , the perpetrators might just be not particularly smart terrorists . 
  if you see soros you must yell : '' bad soros !,

  get your shit together eesti, 
  we can into progress, 
  i find it kinda sad how russia could have become an absolute juggernaut if history went a bit more differently , but instead become a bear with a gambling problem and tuberculosis . 
  i do n't get it, 
  we are so insignificant there are n't even jokes about us . 
  ex-british colony iirc . 
  like half the world, 
  i was joking about how macron is like harvey dent ( dark knight harvey ) before half his face got melted .
