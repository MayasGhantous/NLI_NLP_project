  i think the most important part is n't melting everyone 's army into a huge blue blob , but rather having every army use the same equipment , standards , laws , etc. 
  like the nations would still have control over their armies , but those armies would be the same in every country .

  what a day , what a lovely day !, 
  hear me out , you are not gon na believe this : *** `` alexandria '' ***, 
  it 's somewhat hard to grasp , because the ui is not the best . 
  knowing how much resource you actually control of , or have access to was something i did n't get for a few dozen hours . 
  the [ wiki ] ( http://www.victoria2wiki.com/victoria_2_wiki ) and r/paradoxplaza can offer you some help , should you want to try the game again . 
  i really do n't know where people find information that horthy was a fascist dictator , afaik he opposed both fascist and communist . 
  i 'd definitely recommend to get vic 2 though . 
  it 's an older paradox game , before their 200 euros of dlc per game policy , so you can pick it up for around ~ 7,5 euros with all expansions and stuff . 
  it 's one of their best games , 1836-1936 time period , most detailed economy and population simulation i 've seen out there , with soft and hard imperialism . 
  you actually wage war for resources and have to pick your fights , because you can not endlessly blob , and wars are actually detrimental for your economy and population . 
  after you get used to the game , get the hpm mod , which adds a bunch of stuff to the game , albeit makes it more railroady . 
  hell of a learning curve tho . 
  it 's like an excel staring simulator .

  my first thought was that the satellite was n't good enough and they brought it back . 
   people still make jokes about trump 's wall that 's because it costs as much as half their fucking carrier fleet e. : 1 gerard r. ford aircraft carrier costs ~ 10,5 billion , the projected costs of the wall wary from 20-70 billion . 
  there 's still the part of shedding a few dozen or hundred billions from our budget tho,

  dis gud shit, 
  we would totally have a carrier battlegroup . 
  and we would use it on the danube to claim back our lost territory ^ ^ / s e. : seriously do n't give orb\u00e1n carrier battlegroups pls . 
  it is still the de facto language of the internetz and science and like what , 30-50 % of europe speaks it . 
  yeah , but tanks are one thing . 
  there 's artillery , small arms , trucks , apcs , ships , planes etc. 
  tbh , i do n't get why could n't nations have their own armies , while also being part of a larger eu army . 
  like nato , just more integrated . 
  english , or french . 
  probably english . 
  why would n't you use english ? 
  i thought that was some fake word from a fake language like danish or dutch, 
  china is basically as big as europe . 
  so yeah . 
  what does that mean ? 
  it would save a shitton of money in r&d alone . 
  imagine not having to individually develop the leclerc , leopard , ariete and that tank looking space hussar that the polish call pl-01, 
  should have given him the damn gun, 
  the patent is about the shell , which should work with any 155 mm howitzer , they planned using the m198 howitzer which has a range of around 22 km , so it can fire from a safer distance . 
  e. :  the gun 34 may comprise a m777 , medium 155 mm field howitzer developed and manufactured by bae systems land armament , including all variations . 
  in another embodiment , the gun 34 may comprise a haubits fh77 , medium 155 mm field howitzer , developed and manufactured by bofors , including all variations . 
  in still another embodiment , the gun 34 may comprise a m109 paladin , self-propelled medium 155 mm howitzer manufactured by bae systems land armament , including all variations . 
  in yet another embodiment , the gun 34 may comprise a 152 mm howitzer 2a65 , medium 152 mm howitzer developed by multiple design bureaus with the former ussr ( now the russian federation ) , including all variations . 
  in other embodiments , the gun 34 may vary . 
  the fire 36 may comprise a forest fire , a nuclear plant fire , a chemical fire , or another type of fire . 
  portugal has 24 ( 6 retired ) retired m109s which could use this . 
  the roman empire is mindbogglingly amazing . 
  damn . 
  well , this is just a way to more effectively use it . 
  i do n't know what kind of retardant they want to use , the article only said that it would be mostly water with chemicals mixed in . 
  here 's the [ patent ] ( https://www.google.com/patents/us20160216091 ) . 
  i think it 's still in development . 
   forest fire retardants that are used are generally considered non-toxic , [ 20 ] but even less-toxic compounds carry some risk when organisms are exposed to large amounts . 
  [ 21 ] fire retardants used in firefighting can be toxic to fish and wildlife as well as firefighters [ 22 ] by releasing dioxins and furans when halogenated fire retardants are burned during fires , [ 23 ] and drops within 300 feet of bodies of water are generally prohibited unless lives or property are directly threatened . 
  [ 24 ] the us forest service is the governing agency that conducts research and monitors the effect of fire retardants on wildland systems in the us . 
  [ 25 ] [ 26 ] according to wikipedia , they are somewhat harmful . 
  you could probably put out some nasty bush fires with a creeping barrage , i 'd reckon as well . 
  e. : wait , i fucked it up . 
  creeping barrage is for watering crops . 
  i 've read about an interesting project about using old 155 mm gun-howitzers to help fight forest fires . 
  the idea is that you fill the shells with fire repellent material and with a constant barrage , you could suppress the fires better than using airplanes .

  huh , i did n't know that germans are exporting royal families . 
  damn , how 's that business fares ? 
  i mean , nowadays in this age the need for a royal family with a good pedigree is not that high , i 'd reckon . 
  how much an \u00c1rp\u00e1d-level dynasty costs nowadays ? 
  german flag would be more appropriate me thinks . 
  i 'd highly recommend getting hold of some [ t\u00far\u00f3 rudi ^ ^ tm ] ( http://24.p3k.hu/app/uploads/2017/02/3899dfe821816fbcb3db3e3b23f81585_xl-e1488219388118.jpg ),
