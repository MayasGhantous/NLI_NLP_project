  politics . 
  for some reason it just does n't work when we have to organize it ourselves . 
  i can understand your opinion , however the biggest loosers of that situation would be their citizens . 
  who did not vote on them . 
  ( quick math : around 40 % of people voted last time , and they got around 70 % of the votes . 
  that is around 25-30 % of hungarians from they get their support . ), 
  so even if you thought there are too much hungarian immigrant workers in the west ( around 600 000 people ) think again - in that scenario ( hungary leaving or banned from the eu ) you will get a shitload of more . 
  because no sane person will stay in this country without any democratic support which has the power to stand up against this government . 
  he is your grumpy old neightbor , who is against anything new and would stick with the old ways - but him having too much power . 
  he is saying lots of things , but 99 % is utter bullshit - his worse is his `` hanging speech '' he gave during their last rule [ back in 2002 ] ( http://magyarnarancs.hu/belpol/kover_laszlo_akasztasos_beszede_elso_fokon_elutasitva_polgari_batorsag-62218 ) : `` a lot of people are n't happy with the actions of the government . 
  that is why i advise : they should buy a rope , some nails and a hammer , go down in the basement and using the nail , or if they can find a good beam they should hang themselves . 
  but maybe i 'm too harsh . 
  they can live , it is a great enough pain for them to see that we reach our goals . 
  at most we have to carry them along the way . '', 
  not exactly . 
  their motivation - if that 's the case - is to ruin small independent news websites that always badmouth them and release news they do n't want people to hear - like how insanely corrupt they are . 
  or maybe they need extra money , since their `` official explanation '' is that many people do n't pay telephone taxes because they talk online . 
  but anyways , pirating site are sadly the `` norm '' here . 
  let me explain : - in hungary the minimal wage is beyond the subsistence minimum amount . 
  - if an average family pays their taxes , their wages , food and everything they need for a living , they are most likely out of money by the end of the month . 
  - this means most people can not afford everyday entertainment . 
  so if you 're not part of the rich community ( you can not be in the middle class - since it pretty much is vanishing here ) you 're only chance of being entertained is via torrent sites - which the hungarian laws do n't punish you for - only content distributors . 
  so anyways , in hungary torrenting is n't something most people frown upon , and also it is not something careless people do . 
  for example the site in question is an exceptional partner for distributors . 
  for example : when watchdogs were released the distributor did n't threaten the site , instead asked nicely not to post the game for some time , which the site gladly did so . 
  oh , and as u/dngrs said it , they have a tradition of doing various handicraft . 
  when they travelled here from the east , their lastnames were adapted from their original jobs . 
  most common hungarian exaples : - lakatos = `` locksmith '' - fazekas = `` potter '' - kanalas = `` spoonmaker '' - kolomp\u00e1r = `` metalworker '' - etc. . . today only very few of them work in these titles , but some still do it out of tradition . 
  i did meet some of them - but i can not tell a story without sounding racist . 
  those gipsies who have a properly paid job mostly work as musicians or gastronomy . 
  their music is even considered as a hungaricum , their food i find a bit salty , but otherwise delicious . 
  and those people i met was not your stereotypical `` playing the ghetto though guy '' - instead decent human beings , mostly being nice to you . 
  now the racist sounding part : sadly the minority try to work decent . 
  the others just cry and complain that they are poor , the society does not want to accept them and that 's why they need to steal or rob other people so they do n't starve to death . 
  i know a story about an old gipsy man who was working as a carrier at my father-in-law 's town . 
  he worked everyday from dusk till dawn and used horse drawn carriages . 
  now he was n't very rich , but decided to earn enough to build himself a house and have his kids go to university . 
  the funny part : that he was hated . 
  no , not by the hungarians . 
  the locals knew he is a fellow lad , and he was respected by them . 
  the other gipsies hated him . 
  they envied that he has everything he needs , and he does work everyday , as the image of `` doing work as a gipsy leads to a decent living '' ruins their `` gipsies are not respected enough , so people will not allow them to work '' opinion . 
  his opinion ? 
  `` i do n't give a damn . 
  if they do n't treat me as - one of them - then i just carry on with my own life . '',

  the other countries have so much funny content in their lists !, 
  i wonder what my country shall bring me !, 
  let 's see here : - hungarian google - facebook - international google - youtube - news - blogs - news - wikipedia - used stuff webshop - e-mail - blogs - news - tabloids - yahoo - weather - news - used stuff webshop - t-online - used stuff webshop - tv , cinema , and other programmes - news - tabloids - used cars webshop - generic website ... what is this ? 
  are we boring seniors of the internet ?? 
  the majority of people feel insignificant in politics . 
  the motto is : `` why would my opinion count ? '', 
  also , the last huge movement was the 2006 riots , but even then , the then prime minister said it best : * `` they go to riot , they get bored by it , and they go home . 
  '' * the current government perfected that method . 
  now whenever there is a riot , they just do n't care . 
  when people see their movement does n't change anything , they just give up . 
  another problem is how those who do n't agree with the current government 's policies ca n't or do n't want to stick together . 
  when group a has problems and marches the streets , other people who are not affected by group a 's problems just watch and say `` hah !, 
  thank god it 's not my problem ! '' . 
  ( example : when selling tobacco was taken into the hands of the state , they decided who will have the rights and support by state to sell tobacco . 
  most of these rights went to friends and families of government-close people . 
  when those who were making a living from selling tobacco since decades went to the streets , the everyday people just said `` well , i do n't have a tobacco shop - it 's not my problem . '' ), 
  the message is simple and fair i guess , but there are some things you need to understand : i. 
  the government is ` not ' fascist . 
  sure it * looks * like one - but the official-unofficial `` fascist '' party of hungary is not fidesz and kdnp ( the current parties in charge ) . 
  they are conservatives , but far from being fascists . 
  the closest party being fascist would be the jobbik , which even sees the country 's only chance for leaving the eu ( because they see it as an enslavement , rather than equal members joined together ) . 
  the majority of hungarians did ** not ** vote on them . 
  for the second term at least . 
  elections are held every 4 years , the first time they got elected was in 1998 . 
  they got to rule for 4 years , after that , the socialist mszp took place from 2002 to 2010 . 
  this government was rather controversial , the most notable case being the [ leaked speech of \u00d6sz\u00f6d ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferenc_gyurcs%c3%a1ny%27s_speech_in_balaton%c5%91sz%c3%b6d_in_may_2006 ) , followed by a [ mass protests ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_protests_in_hungary ) in 2006 . 
  after all that , people were fed up with that party 's actions , and the only chance for some to turn things around was to vote on their counterpart , fidesz . 
  at the time , the politics of fidesz was a people centric , yet western friendly attitude , promising better living conditions , work , and so forth . 
  however after they got into power , they started to change everything for their own benefits , because - the only thing i have to admit - they are too good politians . 
  not in a moral point of view , but they really know how to manipulate people . 
  they knew from the very start , that they get the people 's votes of the magical number of 66 % . 
  this meant they even can easily modify the constitution ( and any laws for that matter ) , since the counter-reactions or `` no votes '' will not be enough to stop them . 
  * now i told you this so you will understand how this happened : * because this ended up in modifying the rules for the election system . 
  they knew that their actions might be unpopular , so they had to make sure they win the second term in 2014 . 
  i ca n't tell you the details exactly , since no one really can understand , but the point is that with the help of transylvanian and fidesz-hearted voters , they got the 66 % support yet again . 
  but this is not so correct , since only 40 % of the people went voting . 
  that 40 % was n't enough before , now it is . 
  and also , that 40 % was n't 100 % hungarian living citizens , but a lot of them were transylvanians , and other `` people who do n't live in hungary , do n't pay hungarian taxes , yet have hungarian citizenship given by fidesz , and have the right to vote on the hungarian elections '' . 
  so anyways , if you do the math , you find out , that less than 25 % of hungarians actually support these assholes , and the majority have just given up with politics , and do n't do anything about it ( except moving to a western country ) . 
  ** tl ; dr ** - majority of hungarians do n't support this asshole orb\u00e1n and his oligarchic government , they took advantage of rising at the elections after a shitty government , only to do everything for their own benefits , and later modifying the election-system so they still can win any other elections with a theoretical great support . 
  more and more young people regardless of education move to any western country ( mostly austria , german , and the uk ) . 
  the government 's reactions as time progresses : * `` they do n't emigrate !, 
  they are just youngsters looking for adventure ! '', 
  * `` do n't worry !, 
  by 2018 the hungarian economy will be so advanced , that everyone will come back home ! '', 
  * `` you know , the reason they are moving to the west is because of the previous government !, 
  they started it all ! '', 
  * `` the current eu migration policy is hypocrite !, 
  we think it needs to be changed ! '', 
  that book is a textbook for `` religion-class '' - a class about faith , religion , and ethics , made mandantory by fidesz 's ( governmental party ) partner , the catholic democratic people 's party from ages 7 to 11 yo . 
  the article gives it 's concern that a mandantory class teaching children about homosexuality is a deadly crime will end up in an already difficult stage in teenagers ' lives even more difficult . 
  so basically , it is allowed to , but it is still frowned upon , and probably there wo n't be any change in the near future .
