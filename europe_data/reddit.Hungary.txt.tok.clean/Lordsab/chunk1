skyrim is for the czechs !, 
  that 's a whole new level of `` not best buddies '' . 
  i see where you 're going , but i doubt that riot would be goal . 
  yes , the escalation of the situation ( `` our great police boys making order in a foreign mob '' ) is the wet-dream of any rightist party , but i do n't think that 's the main point . 
  i think they primarily want to send a message to the migrants that have n't crossed the hungarian border yet , that they 're not going through here , so do n't even try , not here . 
  it could also be a way to put pressure on the eu to revise the dublin regulations , but considering the pace of the eu legislation , i do n't see that happening very soon . 
  about the crowd , i think they 'll eventually dissolve and play the whole illegal border-crossing theme that they did so many times before . 
  + trianon, 
  oh yes , it most definitely is . 
  except , it 's written with a ` v ' , because we do n't use ` w ' in hungarian . 
  optionally , you can top it with a kurva =  kurva isten bassza meg . 
  `` fene egye meg '' or `` fene vigye el '' = let the scourge ( plague ? ), 
  eat it/take it . 
  `` baszd meg az any\u00e1d '' = the classic fuck your mother !, 
  ^ ^ feel ^ ^ free ^ ^ to ^ ^ add ^ ^ kurva, 
  when i saw your question , i was thinking about croatia and slovenia myself , too . 
  what does latvia offer to that 27 % ? 
  if i understood the reasoning correctly , according to some international whatnot , serbia is not considered a safe country for asylum seekers ( do n't really know why though ) and hungarian border patrols ca n't turn the migrants back . 
  this is not a problem with romania or croatia , so they could just be turned back to seek asylum there ? 
  afaik they only apply for the asylum because they must . 
  after the application is done , they continue their journey and get the actual paper in germany ( or wherever they want to go ) . 
  i am not sure if they continue legally or not , i suppose noone would really want to stop them ( it 's also pretty difficult inside the schengen ) . 
  only a very little fraction waits for the hungarian asylum . 
  i think there is a book called `` why is romania different ? '', 
  or something, 
  moldova should be part of romania , which should be part of hungary , which should be part of austria , which should be part of germany . 
  portugal is into lebensrsaum , huh ? 
  yea , that 's the real one . 
  i 've always wondered what keeps the wheelbarrow-business running , 
  man , look at that wheelbarrow !? 
  it has paint on it !, 
  i thought they only come in 30-years-worth-of-shit colours . 
  i hope at least its wheel is creaking . 
  you skipped the [ mop ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/komondor ) !, 
  somewhat related : the hungarian translation of the [ diagon alley ] ( http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/diagon_alley ) is abszol \u00dat,

  did i make it ? 
  am i on * the list * ? 
  btw i was seriously interested there for a moment , but i 'm too lazy to look it up , so i 'll just leave it at that ... 
  i like how they did n't care to write down what the heck that agreement contained , other than `` lgbt rights '' .

  an emerging v4 would mean a complete failure of every current power 's foreign policy in europe , especially germany 's and russia 's . 
  they 'd rather sign molotov -- ribbentrop 2 before letting the `` buffer zone '' become a player . 
  i 'm also not sure if v4 even wants to become a thing that much ? 
  it seems to be more like a `` with and without you '' relationship than a true goal .

  i think most people are aware that he was croatian ... or , at least recall that he has something to do with croatia :d, 
  then people will link to redirecting sites , that are registered on an asteroid by the jupiter ( or maybe just a pacific island , but the asteroid sounds better ) . 
  or there will be pop ups with stupid legal stuff that `` it 's actually not the site linking , it 's you randomly visiting that link '',

  we usually use the hungarian names for traditionally hungarian cities ( i.e.

  you must mean sevent ... do you know something ? 
  btw there is an english version : http://www.kormany.hu/en/the-prime-minister/news/we-need-to-establish-a-european-army,

  wir 're adopting the neue common language so schnell .
