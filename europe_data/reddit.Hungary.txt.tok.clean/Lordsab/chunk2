  `` are you sure you want to exit ? '', 
  * northeast europe * , that 's new, 
  same in english, 
  imo it would be even worse if none of the million contracts that are in effect contained the rules of the draw . 
  if they violated any of those contracts , they can be held accountable . 
  but i 'm no lawyer either .

  imo it has an italian rhythm ( slightly ) , but when you get thrown off by the eastern/slavic vocals , you know it 's romanian . 
  i 've heard enough of it to recognize it from a mile away , though . 
  his/her mum has driven every car in portugal , duh . 
   not enough drama at the border atm that 's my gut feeling as well . 
  i think they expected the migrant flow to be back by april . 
  so , it 's basically like the `` women go to toilet together '' thing , but in bigger scale ?

  that was 2 separate cases with the same suffix on hungarian grammar classes . 
  i hated philosophizing on whether it 's a `` for '' or a `` because of '' .

  yeah , and then they present how those rude bastards insulted the `` hungarian people '' . 
  no dumbfuck , they insulted you , not the country/people/nation ... 
  not the coffee table !!, 
  giaur eu grapes, 
  idk . 
  sleeping resets everything i guess :d, 
  most people simply do n't drink at all if they 're expecting to drive that day . 
  even if they do drink a beer or two , they wait 4-6 hours before getting into car . 
  probably overkill , but better be sure . 
  hungarian railways is cancer . 
  prepare for the worst, 
  there should be a middle ground , really . 
  like a slanted deck , so it can slowly slide into the water without splashing . 
  yeah , same here . 
  came to / r/europe to check out what 's going on there . 
  nothing on here though , just shitposting as usual . 
  iirc there was an article about one of soros ' son a week ago maybe . 
  they were like `` omg he 's going to parties and drinks alcohol . '', 
  and each other of course, 
  tbh we hate everyone , not only jews, 
  did a quick check . 
  i was wrong , there are actually unlimited data plans for 20 , but 1000 minutes calls start at 25 with no data . 
  so probably that 's the bottleneck here . 
  i do n't think unlimited data even exist , for any price . 
  they give you proper internet , but only if you buy the expensive plans that has a whole bunch of ( or sometimes simply unlimited ) free calls and text messages that you 'll never use up anyway . 
  otherwise you get a few hundred mbs tops . 
  although , i think there are plans for tablets that have a decent internet for proper price , but those sims can not call or text at all iirc . 
  probably they did n't consider those on this map,

  [ guys , i 'm stuck . 
  anyone 's got a walkthrough ? 
  lot of people ca n't afford to buy a brand new car , so they buy a used one . 
  to satisfy this need , lots of used cars are imported from the west . 
  it 's truly a beautiful castle , though . 
  definitely you,

  is that also why red is missing ? 
  who needs language if you can repeat it louder ?

  that 's a broad definition of europe, 
  and my axe, 
  encourages them to share it , maybe ? 
  is that dark or milk chocolate ? 
  `` do you keep your hands in your ass ? '', 
  comes to mind . 
  also `` do you live in a cave ? '', 
  there are cases where you need to attach multiple similar suffixes to a word and you need a second run to figure out exactly what goes where . 
  especially notorious is the ` make someone do ' suffix - tet , combine it with a past tense - t and some more stuff and you 're guaranteed to get lost in your t 's by the time you realize you fucked up , you 're ` tet tet tet ' - ing like a broken record . 
   but they became gradually more and more expensive each year , so only the well-to-do families can afford them now . 
  summer camp places are sold out months ahead , so it 's not like a super-elite thing , though .
