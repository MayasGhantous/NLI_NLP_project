finally orban does something sensible . 
  [ belehalok ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uylz_e2mafk ) is very popular in hungary . 
  it is one of the most viewed hungarian youtube video of all time . 
  well to be honest , if liechtenstein decided to let immigrants into their country , the whole country would be full within a day . 
  still managed to beat hungary 3-0 lol, 
  for hungary : favourite : most probably croatia . 
  we supported them in the yugoslavian war . 
  least favourite : well ... ... due to historic reasons , we probably hate serbia , romania and slovakia . 
  we dislike them on the same level . 
  this is the country 's population 's general opinion . 
  it was comparing hungarian and finnish mythology, 
  we eat goulash , but not everyday like most tourists think, 
  thanks for linking , new radio, 
  there have been more homeless people in the past . 
  the situation is slowly imrpoving . 
  but yeah you are right about solving this problem as soon as possible . 
  [ fekete p\u00e1k\u00f3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1k6us3_7cyk ) , comedian, 
  of course , finland do a metal [ version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a247r3mns5a ), 
  interesting concept , but its difficult to see messages in europe since so many people are online there, 
  i 'm not german , but i think [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve1rgxpwtdk ) is quite popular there, 
  difficult to claim something hungarian in the middle of romania . 
  the communitites are sorronded by romanian speaking populations . 
  yes , south of slovakia , which is majority hungarian and the north of serbia . 
  i see what you mean , but its easy to say that when you own areas that we want . 
  plus its a bit fucked up you want to divide hunagrian majority counties , so that hungarians become minoritites . 
  i went to austria last year and i remember that a whole petrol station was operated by hungarians . 
  ca n't agree more with your last point . 
  unfortunately its difficult to get rid of orban just like that . 
  shortest is ' \u00d3 ' no ? 
  meaning old , like \u00d3buda, 
  [ reminds me of eurotrip ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1myqy5yeld0 ), 
  orban is probably desperate to leave the eu , so he can bumlick putin, 
  what a friendly place must that be, 
  `` are people in your country always hungry ? '', 
  well said, 
  what is up with everyone and borders recently ? 
  is it just me or is someone around 2 mins crying for help in hungarian ? 
  where should i begin ... 
  i love these pictures from space . 
  they clearly show where the big settlements are . 
  interesting . 
  in uzhhorod we have very good internet . 
  what the actual fuck ? 
  never knew that existed, 
  they should go out all sandu ciorba, 
  how is sandu ciorba viewed in romania in general ? 
  it just seems that he has the most views on youtube . 
  are there any other rokiczanka stuff , because i only seem to find around 3 songs by them on youtube, 
  where is sandu ciorba ?? 
  part ukrainian , so [ made in ukraine ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08p7pyhblq0 ), 
  when i was young i was i thought everyone played the game . 
  when i went abroad i found out no one played it outside of hungary . 
  as a non-finnish speaker , it seems to have no logic to it . 
  that is ours mate, 
  to be fair , he has a point, 
  dali paintings are very creative and encompass a lot of interesting concepts, 
  yep, 
  pretty cool , more of this kind of stuff please / r/europe, 
  apart from [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d2az8wgsqk ) , it is the only time ever heard kyrgyzstan ever being mentioned . 
  as you are american , is life at college similar to the one portrayed in american pie ? 
  what about metal , i love metal too !, 
  in my case , hearing them have sex, 
  not bad, 
  i think bulgaria has it all . 
  i would n't mind living there if money was n't a problem, 
  has that magical feel . 
  we are witnessing history here, 
  ylvis from norway . 
  as the discussion is tv , is there anywhere i can watch turkish fur anfanger with english subtitles ? 
  went to karpatalja , and i could sort of feel an accent there too . 
  i 'd say for hungary the most popular is [ belehalok ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uylz_e2mafk ), 
  i know the ylvis show in norway , which is comedy . 
  they made [ what does the fox say ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofnr_wkoce ) . 
  some clips from their episodes have subtitles and are on their youtube channel . 
  right then . 
  stop judging us if you are doing the same . 
  at least we did it at non-schengen borders . 
  thanks to all this fence business , hungary has a bad reputation , and now it is suddenly acceptable . 
  not from my country , but [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swivbesd50 ) was a pretty big hit in netherlands when i was there . 
  what is wrong with us , apart from this migration clusterfuck, 
  i thought i have seen everything in the music industry , clearly not . 
  and people must remember this is happening all over ukraine, 
  wow never knew this existed, 
  it also has a lot less poverty and corruption . 
  it is a developed nation . 
  not on the level of brazil , but you would be suprised . 
  orban is very corrupt and people in rural areas are still quite poor . 
  you will probably take us over . 
  your country just seems better run than ours, 
  na not really , the minimum wage of 500ft ( ~ $ 1.60 ) is pretty shit, 
  exactly . 
  he might seem bad for eu countries , but he is defending russian interests , the people who he is meant to represent, 
  that is interesting with the house prices . 
  it seems like a good idea to me as it is easier to compare house prices around the eu . 
  i always find it difficult to compare house prices in forints with the ones in the rest of the eurozone and britain . 
  what happened to the lei ? 
  i remember going to romania 10 years ago , around the time a new lei came out . 
  a local told me that they just knocked off the zeros . 
  is that true ? 
  i was very little so cant really remember the whole situation .
