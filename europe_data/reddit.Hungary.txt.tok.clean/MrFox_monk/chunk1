the symbol of quotas was a bigger matter than a real solution to the problem in europe . 
  well said, 
  this is exactly the king of narrow-mindedness i was referring to . 
  thanks for being the example . 
  thanks for proving my point . 
  you of course can not ignore children and desperate families . 
  but some people ** only ** see children and ignore the possibility that there might be a threat among the migrants , some people ignore the fact that not all of them are asylum seekers . 
  people also ignore the fact that a group of hundreds or even thousand migrants can and in fact did paralyze infrastructure partly . 
  and this is not even the full picture , these are just a few points that many people ignore , yet criticise and point fingers . 
  from the article :  razor wire is designed to prevent criminal acts , like a burglary . 
  fleeing children and adults are not criminals this kind of narrow-mindedness is the reason we stand where we stand today ... 
  ah they 'll blame this on hungary too , for giving out ideas . 
  i 'm telling my opinion here , not facts . 
  one can agree or disagree . 
  let me repeat myself again : ** in my honest opinion ** half truth is false information . 
  i also believe that withholding essential information makes the information false . 
  opinions and personal values aside , at the end of the day we agree that it 's very bad journalism . 
  generally it 's not , but it depends on the reader . 
  media which uses sensational click-bait titles like this has a target audience who tends to believe this kind of false information , or let 's just say half truth . 
  hungary is gassing children now ! = hungarian police is intentionally using tear gas on children . 
  but the gullible public will believe that , spread false information , and false information is a lie ** in my opinion ** . 
  i 'm kindly and respectfully asking you to use your head a little , please . 
  what did the children do in the front lines ? 
  the title suggests intention , like the police would intentionally use tear gas on children . 
  you 're right , you just have to leave half of the story out and you have an a + article . 
  but this headline sickens me . 
  very democratic ... 
  random media : `` we 're just making up lies now to make hungary look bad because we have nothing better to report '', 
  as long as the migrants do n't have weapons on them it 's not necessary , that 's why i 'm skeptic about the armed humvees . 
  edit : found some here http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3236418/hundreds-migrants-risk-lives-attempting-reach-western-europe-croatia-route-littered-50-000-active-landmines-hungary-seals-serbian-border-razor-wire.html, 
  they 're reuniting them . 
  i 'm sorry if that 's true , it 's hard to believe . 
  feel free to prove me wrong , but i 'm calling bullshit on this one . 
  edit : especially because of the part about the police shooting at them without reason . 
  edit2 : do n't just downvote , there are literally more journalists with cameras there than refugees , show me some footage of this please so i can believe it . 
  edit3 : i do n't mean to offend anyone , but to my best knowledge there 's no hungarian policemen on the serbian side , and the border is closed . 
  are there any images proving this ? 
  i have n't seen or heard of anything like this anywhere but from the reuters . 
  i do n't think most of us hates refugees , i certainly do n't hate them !, 
  the same can happen to any of us if history turns out that way in the future . 
  however , i do n't like those who come with them acting like refugees , only to make disorder . 
  they 're making the situation worse not just for the countries among their path , but for europe , and especially the actual refugees who are really in need of help . 
  i 'm also genuinely concerned for the safety of my friends , family and my country because of them .

  let 's see how bbc reports this . 
  this is rather concerning . 
  you 're too optimist about being a pessimist . 
   where they would be essentially saying the same thing i think people should read news from a few different sources to get the whole picture instead of just one side . 
  i 'd vote for a filter button instead , like / r/worldnews has , but i 'm not sure how much extra work that involves . 
   yep , and everyone else who wants to immigrate to the eu economic migrants wo n't pay the unrealistically high price of that . 
  did you see how much it costs in austria ? 
  that option is only viable for businesses imho . 
   and after a few years of living abroad my view the hungarian `` mustachio plains people '' do not belong in the eu more then the `` brown sand people '' . 
  let 's just say : hungarians do n't lie to be accepted . 
  i do n't have a people with immigrants , humans are humans , no matter what . 
  but i have a problem with people who lie , no matter where they 've come from . 
  good counterarguments with those links by the way , but look up people from different countries working far from home , you 'll find some interesting numbers . 
  oh man , we could also analyze the reason behind hungarians working abroad , we could talk about those who are coming home , we could also go on and on and on and on about medgyessy , gyurcs\u00e1ny , bajnai , mesterh\u00e1zy and orb\u00e1n , and their actions that lead people to emigrate or the absence of their actions to stop them , but i do n't think this post is the place for that . 
  nice gesture from google . 
  wonderful journalism : `` someone said something happened , but we do n't have any proof , but it happened '' . 
  i 'm not saying it 's true , and i 'm not saying it 's not true , but wonderful journalism indeed . 
   who buys citizenship anyway ? 
  foreign wealthy businessman . 
  but as i said , i do n't necessarily agree with buying citizenship . 
   i am protecting europe from economic migrants that 's the case . 
  actual refugees who follow the rules and head to the border crossing point instead of crossing the border illegally , wo n't be turned back , even if the opposing media tells you otherwise . 
  i do n't see how this might be relevant regarded to the migrants and refugees . 
  you might also want to know that other eu countries have been doing this way before hungary , and for example it 's way way more expensive in austria . 
  i do n't necessarily agree with this kind of money milking , but regarding the current situation it 's a shitty argument on your part . 
  do you really think the us should educate us about illegal immigration ? 
  bbc lost all my respect during this crisis . 
  i 'm not sure what 's their agenda ... 
  nice, 
  the only search result in google for this word is this page . 
  why not both ? 
  let 's eat !, 
  that was expected , but the police can now legally detain those who are not willing to accept and respect the rules , so they damage the fence , instead of going to the official border crossing point . 
  edit : clarification, 
  believe me , hungary is a democratic country . 
  we forcefully lived in communism for decades , most of us know the difference . 
  well , hungary is the first eu country on their path who 's been taking measures to protect europe from the beginning . 
  since then everyone seems to take the same measures , yet nobody apologized for calling us nazis for it . 
  that being said , greece is where they enter the eu , greece should have received more help to protect the borders from illegals , and only let those in who really seek asylum . 
  unfortunately it 's easier said than done . 
  i would love to know what the fuck is wrong with bbc . 
  they 've lost all my respect in the last few weeks and i know i 'm not the only one who feels this way . 
  germany , denmark or even sweden not being good enough for them is the evidence you might be looking for . 
  if you think hungarian police is hostile , you have no idea what hostile means . 
  the average media displays all migrants as poor people without any significant financial assets . 
  i 'm not trying to generalize , so do n't get me wrong , but the mess some of them leave behind in countries during their journey does n't suggest otherwise either . 
  so by default , people are surprised by pictures like this , or the selfie-stick ones someone posted a few days ago . 
  give a little more thought to this . 
  i 'm not sure you fully understand the situation . 
  hard to summarize in one picture [ 1 - pork pork pork pork ] ( http://www.fehertoihalaszcsarda.hu/images/receptek/kemence-disznotor-1b.jpg ) [ 2 - paprika everywhere ] ( http://img1.indafoto.hu/5/3/22293_6e7222ccc5a07f592132ef871b58e08d/8983323_2577c669ecb7c4c247daaa199dbc411d_xl.jpg ), 
   hungary refuses to accept any refugees this is far from truth , i hope you know it . 
  there 's a huge difference between refugees and economical immigrants . 
  the opposing/bleeding heart media tends to diminish the difference . 
  they were checking every vehicle able to hide passengers from what i 've heard . 
  i think germany might be afraid to take back the open invitation at this point , but welcome them , and act later when the situation gets even worse . 
  the way bbc presents this crisis is sometimes infuriating .
