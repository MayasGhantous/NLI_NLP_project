  i do n't agree with the clothing part i think i have lots of german , swedish , japanese stuff ( all of them made in china and se asia i guess ) in my normcore wardrobe but not that much american one . 
  well i wear an oakley which is awesome so i got ta give them that ( but i 've mostly had italian glasses before that ) . 
  and [ tokyo ] ( http://famouswonders.com/wp-content/gallery/mount-fuji/mount-fuji-and-tokyo.jpg ) ( fuji is like 120 km from the city center ), 
  is n't that a cupcake upside down though ? 
  if we want to really split hairs , a 52 % -48 % results means 4 percentage point difference , which is 8.3 % difference so be careful with the nomenclature , math and stats nazis are watching !, 
  said `` independence '' is just a political game and contributes nothing towards humanity as a whole apart from slowing down advancements . 
  space exploration is quite the opposite . 
  but anyways , esa and eu are completely different organizations and parting one does n't affect the relations with the other . 
  that is beautiful , thanks for sharing . 
  thanks for the link . 
  this means that there was a giant jump in suzuki sales between 2014 and 2016 . 
  interesting !, 
  i think the data is outdated . 
  it was the most popular small family car in the 2000s , i am not sure that is true anymore . 
  it was very cheap ( locally produced ) so people went with it . 
  but it is not that cheap anymore . 
  the data i could find with a quick googling : * in 2014 , they sold 67.476 new cars in hungary . 
  the top 5 models : skoda octavia ( 3971 ) , ford focus ( 2595 ) , opel astra ( 2431 ) , dacia duster ( 1960 ) , vw golf ( 1945 ) . 
  * among all the registered cars in 2015 , the top5 : opel ( 451k ) , suzuki ( 404k ) , vw ( 304k ) , ford ( 256k ) , renault ( 204k ) . 
  ford , skoda and opel is very much driven by the corporate fleets while suzuki , dacia , vw is more popolar among people . 
  i think the data on the map is at least a few years old . 
  10-15 years ago , hungarian roads were literally full of swifts that is visibly not true anymore . 
  edit : summoning / u/moustachejoe here also for more visibility , 
  you should convert that into freedom units , he wo n't get the message unless it 's in mpg . 
  i do n't have most of my proper photos edited and shared online because i am way too busy and lazy but here are some random ones on instagram : [ helsinki , finland ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/blubs3mbtzh/ ) [ trieste , italy ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/blhqe0mb-oi/ ) [ warsaw , poland ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/bifymrwdhm2/ ) [ vintgar , slovenia ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/blkcemlbt8g/ ) [ tatras , poland ( around slovak border ) ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/bhsgqnkb2yj/ ) [ lake balaton , hungary ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/bddrim8qslk/ ) [ florence , italy ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/bcxxageqsq_/ ) [ toledo , spain ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/bb-eja3kstb/ ) [ gdansk , poland ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/bh7idkuhzvg/ ) edit : i guess all of these are favorite and maybe more . 
  all of these places are beautiful and since i 've left the old continent for a longer time in october , they already make me nostalgic . 
  traveling is the best fucking thing ever , i am glad it is fairly affordable within most part of eu and i am fortunate enough to be able to afford it . 
  you can scroll through my instagram i 've been to quite a few places in the past 3 years from stockholm to naples , from madrid to kiev ( now i live in japan ) . 
  comments are welcome , i always wanted to improve my photography skills but too lazy to put the proper amount of effort in . 
  also known as : how to transfer large areas of land from one shithole to several more shitholes * ^ ^ and ^ ^ austria * ^ ^ / s, 
  it is definitely the other way around in hungary . 
  i was in helsinki before i left europe for good in october . 
  only for one day but i wish it had been at least 3 or 4 days , i really loved the city . 
  did n't have time to go out drinking but next time . 
  heard stories from a friend who works at abb and visits helsinki from time to time . 
  that 's more of a slovak thing though , is n't it ? 
  not that i have anything against parenyica , i love it  now , that i have limited access to cheese , i 'd take anything honestly !, 
  back in hungary i ' v always kept some euros at home - you know , if things go south , i need some hard currency to get a train ticket to vienna and some more for at least a few day 's worth of sausage . 
  is n't this statement a bit meta-racist though ? 
  can we compare that with speed limit compliance and drunk driving prevalence ? 
  they are memorials . 
  there are other wwii and wwi memorials in almost every town among other memorials from other dark times . 
  that 's how these should be treated and respected but nothing more . 
  most of these memorials have not much to do with nationalism , nationalist people are the ones who are generating the nationalist obsessions and they should just be ignored and not even talked about . 
  not really , the guys i know most opposing bitching about trianon and cut the conversation immediately if it comes up are the hungarians from outside of hungary . 
  they got over it decades ago , only the ones stayed inside are whining about it . 
   there is almost none magyar language used before that year just because the language of the king 's court and the language of the literate elite was latin , does n't mean hungarian language was n't used . 
  as a matter of fact it was widely used for almost a thousand years before that . 
  that 's true , i never stated otherwise . 
  but it does n't change the fact that large portion of the population feel like that . 
  no they 're not . 
  they were the soviets and these are the russians so some consider them a completely different bunch . 
  and it was n't really the worst dictatorship of the hungarian people ( there were worse in the middle ages ) - somewhat the opposite ; after ' 56 , hungary was probably in best shape in the eastern bloc . 
  lots of my grandparents ' and parents ' generation would rather go back to the [ kadar system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%a1nos_k%c3%a1d%c3%a1r ) rather than the current one . 
  i do n't have time to look up polls but they are worthless anyway . 
  and media is out of touch with reality just as the `` 90 % chance that hillary will win '' media , they do n't have a clue how people live and think in rural hungary . 
  people voted a party to absolute majority ( twice ! ), 
  which is populist , openly anti-liberal , eu-sceptic and not only stole their pension funds but one time put a russian flag on the parliament building . 
  that 's the best poll you can get if you ask me . 
  and the strongest opposition party is a far-right nationalist party backed by the russians - one of their leaders openly cheered for the crimea annexation . 
  no , most of their voters would n't say yes to a silly question like `` do you support a russian rule over hungary '' . 
  but they would definitely say putin if they asked `` merkel or putin '' . 
  so that support might be dormant but it is there . 
  yeah , they are called oshiya and there were similar staff at the nyc subway also a few decades back . 
  but these stories are a distortion of tokyo ( as lots of stuff in western media ) and they are not widespread , it 's not like every station is like that all the time . 
  and does n't change the fact that the tokyo metro and train system is a bloody amazing and freakishly effective system . 
  it moves about the population of poland every day around an area of the size of slovenia . 
  i live in tokyo , i take a train to work which is supposedly running at 160 % capacity during rush hour . 
  and it is definitely better than some of the rush hour buses i used to take back in europe . 
  and this allows the streets to be less busy , i have n't seen a traffic jam in tokyo ( though i 'm not moving around the business district where i suppose more people use cars ) . 
   did the people forget how the soviets ass raped hungary back in ' 56 ? 
  they kindof did . 
  old people are nostalgic how much better life was back then in the 60s and 70s , middle aged people are just simply hatin ' on brussels because all the regulations and migrants and who knows what . 
  and some of them are just like all eu leaders are bureaucrat schmucks and putin is the real deal , he is not messing around ( which is kindof true ) . 
  i mean , this is probably not the majority but a significant percentage of the population . 
  our quite strong far right nationalist party , jobbik , is also pro-russia , big time . 
  he _ is _ pro-putin and pro-trump , no question about that . 
  as is a huge portion of the population . 
  whether that 's dangerous or not is open for interpretation . 
  then it is not the best . 
  the best ones can easily handle it ( e.g. 
  yeah maybe , though that depends on the city and means of transportation . 
  it 's not like you have to live under the same roof with every single one of them , 
  it matters in a way that measures how much people _ want _ to leave . 
  granted , lots of them just saying it and will never do it . 
  but a good portion them will leave the country if they can . 
  lots of those who want will never able , especially on the eastern part where some just can not afford the costs of moving or can not leave relatives behind because they have to care for them . 
  if the people who want to leave doubles , i bet that the number of people who _ actually _ leave will increase significantly in 3-5 years . 
  i myself always said i will leave my county 3 , 4 , 5 years ago . 
  finally did after years of thinking about it and about 1 year after the actual , concrete decision . 
  the only way to really enjoy these countries . 
  you 're not into daily politics and news , you probably mostly meet like-minded people , you probably make shitloads more money than the locals and you can go home any time to your home country if you choose so . 
  and if you 're there only for a couple years , it is way easier to get over shit than for those who stuck there for their lives . 
  ( no , i do n't have anything against lodz specifically , never been there , though i consider warsaw to be one of the greatest cities on earth , even beats some canadian places i 've been to , 
  how creepy is that [ this track ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9dg-g7t2l4 ) just started playing seconds before i was scrolling down to your comment , almost in perfect sync . 
  yeah that might be true  and our first president after the soviet rule was a freedom-fighter previously imprisoned by the soviets , wwii pow survivor , poet , writer and the translator of lord of the rings , 2001 space odyssey , among other things . 
  it 's been downhill since him : /, 
  well , still better than the previous one who plagiarized his phd and was total ass about it and even though he resigned in the end , he still has many public titles , awards and whatnot . 
  oh yeah , and there was a racist right-wing ex-communist temporary one between the two for a month or so . 
  but actually this one is pretty ok . people not really care about him that much , the ruling party appointed him and he pretty much just signs the laws the party comes up with and that 's all .
