well , at least they can just go with the `` superior beings from another planet '' theory then . 
  poor lonely basque . 
  a georgian friend of mine told me some linguists think basque might be somehow related to georgian , but there 's not much evidence . 
   but owner talat de\u011fer refused the commission, 
  but * everyone else 's * hovercrafts are full of eels and * they 're * related . 
  that 's interesting !, 
  thank you . 
  yes , in that case the first theory makes more sense . 
  about the second theory , k\u00e1roly r\u00e9dei says that in all but one finno-ugric language , the word for `` god '' and `` sky '' are related . 
  so he thinks hungarian formerly had some word ( probably loanword ) for sky that was similar to `` isten . '', 
  so there would still be some finno-ugric connection there ... possibly . 
  not to mention they practically * begged * the vikings to attack . 
  greco-persian wars ? 
  * obviously * poland 's fault . 
  sink clogged ? 
  blame poland !, 
  somebody spiked the ambassador 's caviar . 
  oh , we get our very own color !, 
  apparently , the origin of the word isten is uncertain , but may come from a word meaning `` little father '' or one guy has a theory it 's a persian loanword . 
  ( [ hungarian source ] ( http://www.nyest.hu/hirek/honnan-jott-az-isten?comments ) if anyone 's interested . ), 
  no worries , i 'm sure russia still has space available if it 's cold weather and tea you 're looking for . 
  good catch !, 
  i had n't even noticed it was a mexican flag . 
  [ sure , let 's do !, 
  ] ( http://metro.co.uk/2015/02/28/want-to-know-which-country-has-the-biggest-penises-in-the-world-5083922/ ) for europe , hungary and czech republic win !, 
  oh , did you miss [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3mdryy/question_for_brits_why_do_you_guys_dislike_putin/ ) ? 
  that makes sense . 
  whatever the cause , sorry to hear this is happening . 
  it 's like they 're trying to start something while the rest of the world is distracted . 
   there 's no tea `` you know where they like tea ? 
  a little town just east of here ... '', 
  do what denmark and hungary did -- put adverts in lebanese newspapers warning of the changes . 
  may or may not help , who knows ? 
  aw , thanks !, 
  mixed up `` berg '' and `` burg , '' i think . 
  that 's sad . 
  that is possible . 
  i was thinking they seem a bit more health-conscious than here , too , but i have n't spent much time there . 
  anyway , the map says italians are fatter than austrians ... * hmm *, 
   beer and pork effect must be . 
  austrians * hate * beer and pork so they stayed thin . 
  :-p / s, 
  we 're all alone !, 
  just have to steal some more slavic words to make up for it , i suppose . 
  i lived in one , too , but only for a year and a half . 
  yeah , they 're not ideal . 
  i suppose i mean just build whatever is cheap and fast to build and not worry much about having a beautiful design . 
  true , although i 'm not sure he would believe that . 
  i was just happy he finally understood how much the media can manipulate things . 
   false equivalences used for israel exactly . 
  i know a guy who complains about israel based only on what he sees in the media . 
  recently he was complaining about how hungary is being demonized in the media . 
  so i pointed out that now he should understand israel 's situation . 
  get attacked by people with rocks and bottles , but the media calls them `` unarmed . '', 
  they use their babies as shields and the police/military are blamed if a baby gets hurt . 
  i think this time i * finally * got him to understand because now he knows what it feels like to be a `` bad guy '' just for protecting your own citizens . 
  i was wondering the same thing . 
  even building something like those old soviet-style blocks of flats would be better than nothing . 
  they do !, 
  israel even has [ skiing ] ( http://www.goisrael.com/tourism_eng/articles/attractions/pages/skiing%20in%20israel.aspx ) . 
  definitely russia . 
  in addition to the legalities , when they were coming through in large numbers , they were trampling crops , leaving trash , blocking roadways , and overcrowding the railways to the point they were nearly unusable . 
  there has to be some control . 
  yeah , they are quite common . 
  my neighbour 's ( next door flat in the same building ) daughter found a grenade in the garden once . 
  the girl was only around 10 and did n't know what it was , so she brought it inside to show mom . 
  either he has no experience with central europe or `` diversity '' only counts with non-integrated groups . 
  i suppose we ca n't count nearby groups , such as germans and croatians ? 
  that still leaves , as maslo59 pointed out , gypsies and jews , quite a few armenians , as well as the more recently arrived turks and chinese . 
  and on the other hand , [ there 's this ] ( http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:m98j990-w9sj:www.eurasianet.org/node/69401+&amp;cd=8&amp;hl=de&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=hu ) . 
  ( foreigners fighting * for * ukraine . ), 
  for what it 's worth , they seem a lot better trained . 
  you might be interested in reading the comments on [ the other ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3m3opf/more_vacancies_than_visitors_more_vacancies_than ) three times this [ was posted ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3lj74e/more_vacancies_than_visitors_eastern_europe_may/ ) . 
  impossible !, 
  it 's only the [ third time ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3lj74e/more_vacancies_than_visitors_eastern_europe_may/ ) it 's [ been posted ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ljgl8/more_vacancies_than_visitors/ ) / s, 
  :-p but seriously , you could probably find stats on ethnic germans , poles , armenians , etc. 
  here too . 
  any group that wants to keep that identity . 
  the last census i remember , they asked your ethnicity ( of course , you do n't have to prove it and you could decline to answer ) , and then `` any other nationality you * feel close to * . '', 
  i thought that was interesting . 
  between [ 35,000 to 120,000 ] ( http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/about/communities/hu ) in hungary . 
  stats vary in part by how you define `` jew '' ( halachically or by some other definition ) . 
  anyway , there 's a significant community . 
  moh\u00e1cs is the classic `` really bad thing that happened , '' though . 
  there 's even a phrase `` we lost more at moh\u00e1cs '' you can say when someone complains about a failure or loss , to make that loss seem not so bad compared to moh\u00e1cs . 
  do n't worry , it turned out to be not real . 
  there was no hunger strike at all . 
  austria 's fp\u00d6 party made it up . 
  i mentioned it mostly because i did n't know if the other poster was talking about this or something in poland . 
  ah , okay , thanks . 
  yeah , that 's pretty bad . 
  i just did n't know if the poster above was talking this or something entirely different that happened in poland . 
  maybe he was talking about [ this in austria ] ( http://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/ots_20150916_ots0149/christian-ragger-unverschaemte-forderung-einzelner-fluechtlinge/?utm_source=2015-09-16&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=html&amp;utm_campaign=mailaboeinzel ) [ also right-wing source , for fair warning ] and got the two mixed up . 
  because they were n't getting 2000 $ / mo. 
  pocket money . 
  you know there are already greenlanders on greenland , right ? 
  and i doubt they want more trouble coming from denmark . 
  actually , that label has an [ interesting history ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/125-years-of-made-in-germany/a-16188583 ) . 
  it was originally meant basically to discourage people from buying german products , but ended up encouraging it because people started to associate the label with good quality . 
  who 's building that thing , [ tepe-akfen-vie ?
