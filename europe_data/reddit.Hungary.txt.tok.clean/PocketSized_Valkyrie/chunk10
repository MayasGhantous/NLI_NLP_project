  verifying and agreeing with u/tin _ dog . 
  we do it , too ; maybe picked it up from germans . 
  only i 've also heard it as * no sex ever again . 
  i wo n't address the economics , * but * there are a lot of small , handmade producers and high-end designers . 
  their products cost more than chinese stuff because , well , labor and materials here cost more . 
  but not * everything * made in europe is extremely expensive . 
  if you want to find local products , you 'll probably have to look for them specifically . 
  and check etsy.com for croatian ( any many other european ) individual designers . 
  anyway , in hungary we have a number of shoemakers , such as alf\u00f6ldi cip\u0151 and tisza cip\u0151 . 
  also clothing makers such as szir\u00e9n ( makes shirts ) . 
  polish apples are like [ tribbles ] ( http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--wwycijgc--/xs7k79odfzfue0n0qsef.jpg ) -- they seem to be everywhere . 
  i 've seen them in hungary , ukraine , georgia . 
  all these places can grow apples , but maybe the polish ones have a good reputation for flavor or something ( in addition to the economic reasons ) . 
  yeah , 700ft in transportation is only two full-fare tickets ( in budapest ) , so maybe it 's okay if you walk almost everywhere . 
  you ca n't even rent a bike for that . 
  these must be absolute minimum and during low season . 
  the estimate for bucharest also seems low . 
  yeah , i can just imagine the laughter from the fishermen . 
  it 's like something from monty python . 
  well , you know , [ accidental invasions ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/feb/19/gibraltar.world ) are bound to happen from time to time . 
  in regard to their leaders , i do n't really like either . 
  in regard to the common people , definitely russians . 
  more open-minded , less judgmental , and the men are less pushy . 
  those are broad generalization , of course . 
  \\ #notallrussiansorturks also , i 've never * lived * in russia , but spent a lot of time around russians in budapest . 
  stayed in istanbul for maybe 1.5 years total . 
  hmm . 
  it seems that way around here , too . 
  i 'm spending the winter a bit farther north and i 'm sad that it 's * still not snowing yet . 
  you can use [ `` handsome '' for a woman ] ( http://www.learnersdictionary.com/qa/can-the-word-handsome-be-used-for-women ) . 
  lietuva `` is very good-looking , and also healthy and strong . '', 
  anyway , that tree is ... interesting . 
  pretty , but yes , the windows make you wonder what lives there . 
  and i 'm surprised it 's not snowing . 
   legal pfft . 
  do n't be silly , this is * business * . 
   at the second coming certainly * sounds * like he 's talking about the messiah . 
  well , i 'll leave it to the greeks here to interpret . 
  but it says for home use ( i think ) !, 
  is n't this some kind of ikea-like home-assembly kit except without the ikea-grams ? 
  well , in this particular case i 'm rather glad it did n't work . 
  [ s\u00f3lstafir - fjara ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6j7muxgz20 ) icelandic and not really wintry . 
  i do n't understand the words , but the video is * so sad . 
  * [ apulanta - jumala ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak7dsxfyl-o ) translation to english [ here ] ( http://whatsupfinland.org/english/apulanta-jumala-apulanta-god/ ) [ jippu & samuli edelmann - pime\u00e4 onni ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkmjywvqzv8 ) [ o\u043a\u0435\u0430\u043d \u0415\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0438 .

  poor dog . 
   tiger-sherman effect i do n't know enough about that . 
  i just know how to convince my clients to give me more time and pay me more . 
  thanks for the correction . 
  it * does * say that in the article , though , unless i misunderstood . 
  i probably misunderstood ... 
  sure , sure , but at least the german-assembled one wo n't fall apart later like the others . 
  good , fast , cheap : pick two . 
  ( that is rather funny , though . ), 
  the greek orthodox church ( like some others ) believes a person has to be buried in order be resurrected when the messiah comes . 
  anyway , it 's a religion-related issue . 
  it 's mentioned in the article . 
  i liked the one who clearly knew where all the countries are , but deliberately labelled them `` mr. darcy , '' `` pirogi , '' and so on . 
   rest is more houses than flats . 
  so similar to most of the east , probably . 
   our shitty dusty windy potholey dirty capitol oh , i must call my travel agent immediately !, 
   half of them are in one city . 
  i can believe that . 
  istanbul is * huge , * like its own country , the population is a little more than 14 mil . 
  and it 's very diverse and probably the best place to find work , so people go straight there . 
  which do you think is more common ? 
  i notice you 're right between mostly-flats latvia and mostly-houses finland , so it looks like it could go either way . 
  ( i 'm assuming you 're estonian , but you have no flair . ), 
   depression oh , you 're just trying to one-up lithuania now . 
  :-p anyway , it certainly made a clear political statement . 
  oh man , that ending . 
  but i do n't even like going to the hair salon . 
  i 'm just weird . 
  i would n't know , i have n't tried either of them . 
  i do n't like strangers touching me ... 
  really ? 
  they 're usually thai , [ like in this phonebook listing ] ( http://aranyoldalak.hu/search/?keyword=thai+massz%c3%a1zs+&amp;area=budapest ) of 43 thai massage places in budapest alone . 
  as far as i know , `` thai massage '' is a legitimate type of massage like `` swedish massage , '' so it 's not necessarily anything illegal . 
  i was trying to make you feel better . 
  :-( but yeah ... there 's that . 
  you 're right , but on the other hand , the un is like the crazy guy on the bus who rants about how evil space aliens are harassing him . 
  while he sometimes makes people nervous , very little he says is logical so no one actually takes him seriously . 
  zurfer 's right , though . 
  it 's an unreachably high and constantly shifting standard specifically designed to be impossible to meet , but it is technically `` higher '' than the one for any other country on the planet . 
  ( and to be clear , yes , i agree that standard is absurd . ), 
   because they know they 're the next in line . 
  yes , i wish more people in europe realized this . 
  you might identify as atheist , but religious crazies still wo n't see you as `` innocent . '', 
  about the house , i do n't know . 
  * if * i remember correctly , he just said `` lost the house . '', 
  it was his father 's house . 
  maybe he ( father ) felt unsafe living in israel , but was n't physically * forced * out . 
  i forgot the year , too . 
  oh , that 's interesting . 
  have a reputation now . 
   if we can fence it off , it 's ours !, 
  cool !, 
  so , should we stop at vienna or try for linz , too ? 
  just , you know , to help austria defend themselves . 
  oh , if we have all the land to bucharest now , there are going to be some * really * annoyed romanians .
