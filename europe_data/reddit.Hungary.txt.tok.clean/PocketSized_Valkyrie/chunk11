  also following this , `` suspected terrorist hideout identified in the australian alps . '', 
  yes !, 
  i was surprised , too , but i think he was referring to muslims not wanting jews there even against what * their * holy book says . 
  i do n't know if it actually says that , i 'm just quoting him . 
  edit : `` holy , '' not `` hold '', 
  do n't feel guilty !, 
  i 'm not upset . 
  anyway , i just crossed out the original -- it 's still readable . 
  but i think they like the fence . 
  anyway , i 've edited . 
  well , i did n't want to pick on one specific nationality so i chose something general . 
  i can see the next headline in this series : `` confused ~ ~ human rights activists ~ ~ drunken tourists protest hungarian fence in front of bulgarian consulate . '', 
  policies are one thing and i 'm sure opinions vary , but i have n't heard the `` kill all jews '' thing from christians . 
  for example , i know an arab christian guy whose family lost their house in bethlehem and , although he 's against taking houses like that ( so am i ) , he * still * does n't want to kill anyone . 
  he said he believes jews have a right to live in israel because it 's `` in the koran '' ( his words ) . 
  poor guy just wants peace . 
  that 's just one example , but still , it just seems people like that are ignored . 
  so true , sadly . 
  also extends to not listening to the opinions of non-muslim people who live in the middle east . 
  i mean , i 've met arab christians who have no issue with israel 's existence ( maybe some arguments with the government , but that 's different ) and hate hamas , yet there are westerners who defend hamas as oppressed innocents while living safely far from any rocket fire . 
  one of the `` reasons '' i 've heard ( not from poles , but in general ) is they think jews want to destroy the `` white nations '' in revenge for the holocaust , so they send arabs to europe to do that . 
  the incoming arabs then scare the european jews into moving to israel , thus increasing israel 's jewish population and driving out more arabs toward europe . 
  then throw in some reptilians and chemtrails and you 've got it !, 
  it 's paranoid conspiracy-inventing . 
  i think there 's a certain type of person to gets attracted to this sort of thing , but that 's another topic . 
  i lost it at `` try denmark '' and kept laughing through the whole thing . 
  although i think `` top-ranking country when it comes to legos '' was my favorite . 
  we should all make these for a neighbor . 
  oh , trying to `` redistribute '' malm\u00f6 to the rest of the world now , are we ? 
  oh , thank you !, 
  sorry for the mis-reference there . 
  sure , you want ~ ~ oil ~ ~ norway , but malm ~ ~ \u00f8 ~ ~ \u00f6 oh , hell no , that 's 100 % sweden . 
  so , austria . 
  that does not look good . 
  i 'm assuming it 's just `` at risk '' per the definition in the study , not an * actual * high level of child poverty . 
  or is there really a problem is area ? 
  except quite possibly not \u00fcber norway ... 
  that looks like oliviersalat , originally from a french chef in russia , i think . 
  it 's called russian salad in hungarian , too . 
  we need to do what [ that dutch newspaper did ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqtqe2vnpbg ) . 
  `` so to anyone coming our way , we have one clear message : try romania ! '', 
  ( sorry , romanians !, 
  just joking ! ), 
  oooh , that 's interesting . 
  thanks !, 
  yeah , i 've heard the different o pronunciations in russian versus ukrainian , but i did n't know there was a name for it . 
  i thought it was just a ukrainian thing . 
   okaniye vocalization wow , i have never heard of this . 
  so , it 's just an o like how ukrainians pronounce it ? 
  i think i 've only heard the second ( the malako example ) , but then maybe i just have n't noticed ( i speak more often with non-natives , so ... ) . 
  anyway , thanks for that !, 
  interesting . 
  some people just have an ear for it , maybe . 
   mostly correct but there are * some * slight differences , are n't there ? 
  a friend of mine ( originally from tula , but lived many years in moscow ) said there 's a slight difference between the moscow and petersburg accents . 
  she tried to demonstrate , but i could n't tell . 
  but certain foreign/ethnic accents are usually obvious to me even as a non-native speaker . 
  do n't be silly . 
  surstr\u00f6mming . 
  i thought finland was getting mostly iraqis , anyway . 
  yes , i included that behind the / s above somewhere !, 
  i can see it now : `` sorry austria , nothing personal , no offense , but ... '', 
  i know , but it is a rather evocative term . 
  i suppose `` technical barrier '' does n't really cover it , though . 
  i do n't want to say what i 'm thinking . 
  : - / but * if * it really happened , it would be temporary construction jobs . 
  that i * did * consider . 
  that 's why the idea seems so absurd . 
  on the other hand , job creation !, 
  yeah , i forgot about that . 
  but that 's still no reason for a wall in the middle of the eu . 
  i can only assume the same place the old one was , which makes little sense considering that the subject here is `` muslim extremists '' and the east has significantly fewer muslims ( of any kind ) than the west . 
  unless it 's to * protect * the east from the `` home grown '' terrorists in the west . 
  / s kind of, 
   is there more room for ukraine to export to eu ? 
  i would like to know more about this , too . 
  there are a lot of good ukrainian food products and even in hungary , i see so few . 
  for example , i 'm quite sure khortytsa vodka ( not a food , but ... ) would sell in hungary , but i 've never been able to find it . 
  tesco sells chumak ( a ukrainian brand ) products at least . 
  i was actually wondering why you did n't suggest that land be given back to armenia rather than to the kurds . 
   appeared on a political debate well , hopefully your new furry overlords are kind to you . 
  well , if you want them to respect you , you 'll have to stop letting the [ cats in istanbul ] ( http://for91days.com/photos/istanbul/istanbul%20cats/istanbul%20cats%2035%2020130707%20istanbul%20cat%20blog%20for91days.com.jpg ) act like they run the city . 
  or they 'll take over ankara next ... ( and i was expecting to see at least 15 cats in that video . ), 
  thanks !, 
  yes , i thought that one was n't really known . 
  i just mean the currently , commonly associated meaning . 
  of course , you 're right , but if you go back to the coat of arms , which goes back to the \u00c1rp\u00e1d stripes , then what is the meaning of the red ? 
  is it known exactly ? 
  so , * that 's * why norwegian and schwizerd\u00fctsch ( and their other three ) are missing !, 
  well , at least you 're not alone . 
  : - / in fact , i wonder if those shipping rules exclude switzerland and norway , too . 
  especially websites that say `` ships to europe , '' but then the fine print says it 's eu only and you happen to be in , say , serbia right then . 
  edit : just noticed you said `` redditors '' not `` people , '' but the point still stands . 
  the red on the hungarian flag is `` strength , '' although i suppose that kind of ties in with blood . 
  i feel our soldiers are less prone to violence than our cops , so ... sure . 
  honestly , though , i feel this is mostly for show . 
  dammit . 
  :-( i did n't even hear about this and i 'm ukraine now . 
  thank you for the links . 
   at all hours of the day and morning oh , * that 's * why the other romanian poster does n't like them .
