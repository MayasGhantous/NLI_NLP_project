  fortunately , were i lived , they only did it during reasonable daytime hours and primarily on sunday . 
  yeah , a 2 am wedding parade would be * rather * annoying . 
  thanks for posting this . 
  i know armenia has such a strong connection with france , there must be so many worried french-armenians there now . 
  and those with family working in france . 
  kind of surprised they did n't hold this in republic square , although choosing france square makes more sense . 
  * really ? 
  was n't it after they were allowed ( allowed as they wanted , not herded on like cattle ) onto the trains ? 
  i assumed he was just annoyed that they were coming into austria . 
  a bit . 
  after spending a lot of time in the near/middle east , i felt * really * uncomfortable walking around with uncovered shoulders . 
  but that was for only one summer . 
  also felt a bit uncomfortable being alone in a room with a man . 
  still a bit sad that our weddings do n't involve long lines of honking cars . 
  and that we ca n't set off roman candles on our balconies . 
  thank you . 
  as far as i know , there were celtic tribes there , then germanic tribes , then later the slavic tribes moved in as the germanic tribes moved west . 
  the first , second , and third aliyahs were due to the pogroms in russia , the fourth largely to problems poland , the fifth due to `` certain issues '' in germany . 
  people left because they did n't want to die and could n't easily get into other places , such as the us . 
  your explanation is exactly why people see the syrians coming as an `` invasive force '' that should go `` back where they came from '' ... in order to be killed . 
  i understand mass migrations is n't a good thing and there should be some control , not just tossing people out of their homes , but calling them invaders is a bit much . 
  yes , i think people tend to take out their anger on whatever and whoever is around them . 
  i remember in 2008 in georgia , some people who 'd been driven out the south ossetia area were complaining about , for example , the dryness the unhcr 's nutritional biscuits . 
  not saying it means they should get everything they demand , of course , but complaints are n't always * proof * of being a mooch . 
  in austria ? 
  have n't noticed . 
  might be a catholic thing , although catholics here neuter their dogs . 
  yes , i saw though one . 
  poor denmark . 
  as if they 're not already deep enough in bunker mode . 
  oh , i did n't mean to call it propaganda . 
  denmark 's were just adverts about the current situation and laws . 
  from your posted article , it sounds like that facebook page is a similar sort of thing -- informing people , not lying to them . 
  [ denmark did , too . 
  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/refugee-crisis-denmark-discourages-asylum-seekers-with-newspaper-adverts-in-lebanon-10490666.html ) although you probably know that already . 
   we 've got the worst and least appreciative expats ah * ha * . 
  those bastards !, 
  either that or they 're anti-social and annoyed by your friendliness . 
  i 'm glad you said it . 
  i was thinking , `` well , even austrians complain about how unfriendly austrians are . '', 
   central european charme yes . 
  yes , that 's what it is . 
  yeah , i mean , * no * part of the world is perfect and i do n't want to live anywhere else , * but * this is not really a new thing . 
   that the world would be latin . 
  i 've never heard that quote . 
  but there * is * still a lot of latin about . 
  and italians still exist . 
  sure , certainly other groups/religions have had problems , too , including protestants . 
  that 's why i say , it varies by place and time . 
  actually , from what i know , the roman empire * brought * jews ( and armenians ) to central europe via the army . 
   what has europe become ? 
  it has n't `` become '' anything different . 
  it simply has n't changed . 
  jews have been excluded if not outright killed for ... as long as there have been jews in europe . 
  the situation varies with time and place , of course , but europe 's the same as it always was . 
  i find [ this map of past attacks ] ( http://www.voxeu.org/article/how-anti-semitism-interwar-germany-was-influenced-medieval-mass-murder-jews ) interesting . 
  ( it 's about germany and i 'm not trying to pick on germany , but i do n't know of any other such maps . ), 
  oh , good find !, 
  yes , this is the kind of weddings you get when teach folk dance in the schools . 
  well , it is choreographed -- erisioni is basically the georgian riverdance . 
  but is n't riverdance based on traditional base ? 
  it 's not something a few people invented , right ? 
  hmm . 
  i 'll look for something less `` showy , '' but if you want people dancing in their back gardens , i do n't know if i can find that . 
  here 's some people [ bustin ' moves ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmtyucc5w3q ) in a restaurant and here 's some [ old footage ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqrfcvkdduk ) , though . 
  but i can say the drumming skills are folk -- i 've heard old grammas drum like that on picnic tables so the kids can dance . 
  [ georgia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1ctkrmbuoc ) . 
  no else comes * close * . 
  except maybe armenia ... 
  true . 
  well , bulgaria has some nice beaches . 
  that 's an alternative . 
  it 's relatively cheap . 
  and warm , of course . 
  a lot of hungarians go to jordan for diving , although jordan 's probably safer than egypt ( also more expensive ) . 
  i suspect if egypt losses popularity , more people will go to turkey . 
  can we let ukraine in , too ? 
  although v8 is already a thing , so we 'll need one more . 
  they are ? 
  well , that explains even more why i got the face-palm and head-shaking . 
  my mother had one and i * thought * she brought it back from switzerland , so that 's why i was confused . 
   you ca n't steal an adult that 's still called kidnapping . 
  according to the poster above , with alcohol . 
  i do n't know the details , i have n't tried it . 
  yet . 
  i think he forgot the / s on the first two , anyway . 
  ah , that 's why he wants the kid . 
  and maybe why they let him keep the kid . 
  that kid 's going to be seriously pissed some day when he finds out what happened . 
  maybe i missed something , but how is the nigerian guy still in denmark legally ? 
  because he has a polish-citizen kid or the job contract went to him later ? 
  or does the article even say ? 
  what was the reason they gave custody to him ? 
  i would think * normally * the bio parent gets custody in such cases . 
  kind of sounds like the authorities are using the child to punish her for running a scam . 
  and vice versa with budapest . 
  of course , our capitals are n't far from each other and we share history , so it 's understandable . 
  but at least we know your language . 
  :-p looked for stats , but all i found was [ an article ] ( http://hvg.hu/itthon/20150707_kulfoldiek_magyarorszagon_triplajara_nott ) saying , `` the number of germans , slovakians , austrians , and russians living in hungary is growing dynamically . '', 
  if [ these stats ] ( https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/magyarorsz%c3%a1g_nemzetis%c3%a9gei ) are correct , our german ( under `` n\u00e9met '' ) population * tripled * in 10 years .
