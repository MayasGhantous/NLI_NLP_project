  i 'm sure there 's been growth , but i wonder if the counting method changed or something . 
  apparently not many slovenes want to live with us , though ... 
   except switzerland this is the problem . 
  it 's easy to over-focus on one wealthy neighbour . 
  we do it , too -- compare ourselves to austria and feel poor instead of comparing to romania and ukraine and feeling lucky ( no offense , neighbours !, 
  agree . 
  i find it hard to believe georgians and armenians drink so little . 
  not saying they 're drunks , but they certainly enjoy their good wine and cognac , and it serves social and religious purposes , too . 
  well , you know us silly easterners are [ easily confused ] ( http://polpix.sueddeutsche.com/polopoly_fs/1.30035.1358395283!/httpimage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/900x600/image.jpg ) . 
  but i agree , i hear more about cucumbers . 
  apparently not horses . 
  we seem to have only ~ ~ somewhat more ~ ~ [ horses per capita ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2015/jun/12/how-many-horses-european-union-eu-equine-census-population ) ~ ~ than ~ ~ the other mongolians of europe . 
  i misread the stats , we have approx as many total , but much * fewer * per capita . 
  love of paprika maybe ? 
  i was once telling my uncle some financial advice i got from a swiss professor . 
  he said , `` probably good advice . 
  after all , what are the swiss famous for ? '', 
  he face-palms and says , `` banking , dear , * banking . 
  * '' so there 's two for you . 
  forgive me , i was young . 
   finnish girls are so cute and shy  i 'm not sure why i 'm getting downvoted . 
  do n't be stealing their girls , man !, 
  thanks !, 
  i was lazy ... 
  reminds me of `` \u041d\u0435\u0437\u0432\u0430\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0445\u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 '' -- it 's a russian saying meaning `` an uninvited guest is worse than a tatar . '', 
  tatars being seen as invading hordes in this case . 
  ( not trying to make russians sound bad , but i just happen to know this saying . ), 
  but yeah , probably just dropping the h does make the most sense . 
  oh , litvia sounds nice . 
  i 'm sure no one will confuse it with latvia . 
  it 's not like people confuse austria and australia or anything . 
  ( but it does sound nice . ), 
  it 's litv\u00e1n in hungarian , so maybe adding the n will help . 
  although leedu sounds cooler . 
   '' lituania '' or '' litauen '' too many vowels . 
  what 's wrong with leedu ? 
  or maybe litvan if it 's not too close to the russian . 
  sure , i just thought it was funny i had such an instant largely illogical reaction to it . 
  it 's funny , those prices feel cheaper in euro than in forints because in my head $ = viennese prices whereas ft = budapest prices . 
  ( i mean 6 $ for lunch in vienna is cheap , but 1900 ft is too expense for lunch in bp . ), 
  anyway , i agree with what you said . 
  what , no horse-drawn carts ?!, 
  :-p i think i might know that street -- is it close to the train station ? 
  i was a little confused there . 
  then i agree with you . 
  did i make a nazi reference ? 
  i was n't calling anyone nazis . 
  just saying some people * say * germany is taking in a lot of foreigners because they have a labor shortage . 
  as far as i know , they do , but they could just as well accept ukrainian , russian , serbian , croatian , etc. 
  workers . 
  they fit in better with german culture . 
  but they send those people away or do n't let them have work visas in the first place . 
  ( which still does n't make anyone a nazi . ), 
  so i do n't believe there is any intent to `` fill a labor shortage . '', 
  exactly why i do n't believe this `` we need workers '' explanation . 
  the war certainly did n't help , but honestly the economic situation was n't good before then , either . 
  but at least it * was * steadily improving . 
  or it seemed to be . 
  exactly . 
   employers opt to rotate graduates so they can renew the subsidy . 
  yes , it 's open to abuse . 
  we had ( or maybe still have ) something like that here in which companies got a subsidy for hiring the long-term unemployed . 
  a friend of mine got a job that way , but then they sacked him when they could no longer get the subsidy for him . 
  oh , they 've come up with something even fancier now . 
  thanks , that makes more sense . 
  but do n't companies * already * prefer people younger than 30 because they work for less ? 
  it seems like a subsidy for hiring people over 40 would be better . 
  i do n't know the situation in poland , though . 
  thank you for this perspective . 
  a lot of the people coming are from areas that do n't like us , but the far-rightists are also getting irritable and while i feel safe in my own country , it 's just ... a very interesting time . 
  oh , i understand why people coming would want to avoid it . 
  but i would see that as the laws keeping people out and the fence keeping order . 
   not indicative of the same type of immigration controls true . 
  i see what you 're saying . 
  how is that different from the hungarian fence ? 
  our borders were n't 100 % closed ( as far as i know ) ; there were and are passage points where people can go through * in an orderly manner * and then claim asylum . 
  but they wanted to go through just wherever and walk/take trains to austria . 
  so ours is also about controlling the flow . 
  maybe the [ angelmakers of nagyr\u00e9v ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/angel_makers_of_nagyr%c3%a9v ) . 
  a good case for why divorce should be allowed , anyway . 
  i mean , he 's only 16 , so i think he * does * have a chance , but only if he leaves the environment that taught him this and is surrounded by better influences . 
  but this is what i was trying to say here a day ago , that i 've lived with this kind of thinking ( from adults ) and i do n't want to live with it anymore . 
  it 's not just `` women should sit in the back of the taxi '' it 's also followed by , `` and if they do n't , they 're whores who deserve to be harassed . '', 
  yours !, 
  or armenia . 
  or maybe denmark . 
  maybe ukraine . 
  actually , this list could get long ... and i 'm only not saying austria because everyone else is saying austria . 
   some people think i think those people confused `` balkan '' with `` baltic . '', 
  i do n't know , though , there should be level 3a and level 3b for nordic crosses because i 'd be impressed with a naturally occurring norwegian flag . 
  and i do n't think anyone should be working to find an isle of man flag in nature ( three human legs in a pool of red ) , even if it is level 5 . 
  i just looked up '' [ country ] flag in nature . '', 
  probably using the country 's own language helps ; that 's how i found the hungarian and german one . 
  oh , man , i have bad eyes . 
  birch makes more sense . 
  thanks !, 
  but apparently yellow pine exists , so til . 
  glad i found one . 
  naturally occurring nordic cross flags are n't so common . 
  i 'm afraid norway and iceland are sol on this one ...
