  wow , i did n't know pine can be that color . 
  i had to google it . 
  the only yellow needle tree i 've seen is [ larch ] ( http://www.buzzbishop.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/img_4784-1024x768.jpg ) , so i just assumed . 
  he still did a good job ... 
  [ scania !, 
  ] ( http://pimg.tradeindia.com/01571632/b/1/tim-tim-orange-drink.jpg ) as close as i could get , sorry . 
  well , that 's just sad . 
  yeah , i remember hearing about that . 
  amazing it took so long to find . 
  maybe that was part of why i thought about intentional plantings . 
  now here 's [ a german flag ] ( http://view.stern.de/de/picture/1814688/sonnenaufgang-himmel-wolken-meeresstimmung-arktis-sea-flagge-940.jpg ) to help you feel better . 
  i would n't know , really . 
  i 've never been there . 
  i was thinking larch are n't so common , so maybe a landscaper specifically chose them . 
  but of course , in the north/cold climates they 're more common . 
  also lovely . 
  yeah , the `` ukrainian flag in nature '' is very popular . 
  there are a few more [ estonian ones ] ( https://www.google.hu/search?q=estonian+flag+in+nature&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=609&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cayq_auoawovchmilmznmzxeyaivhrysch2elajq ) in google images . 
  oh , and here 's [ denmark 's flag in nature ] ( https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcqj9vdmikuqpiwwldks9a7kvr2x-4ylp9tumahwnpvnybktyh-r ) !, 
  ] ( http://data.whicdn.com/images/6123568/large.jpg ) ( i felt bad leaving you out after including denmark . ), 
  that 's lovely . 
  i imagine that was an intentional planting . 
  it turned out well . 
  i can offer a [ hungarian flag ] ( http://trollfesz.cc/i/238323.jpg ) and [ ukrainian flag ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/3c/77/6d/3c776d689e2173069654f0b7962ee8c6.jpg ) ( available in summer only ) . 
  here 's [ eesti 's ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/p%c3%a4ikeset%c3%b5us_paukj%c3%a4rve_vaatetornist.jpg/1280px-p%c3%a4ikeset%c3%b5us_paukj%c3%a4rve_vaatetornist.jpg ) , for zetzet . 
  he knew he was breaking the law , but refused to stop . 
  moreover , by * announcing * that he had a baby , he seemed to think the police should care . 
  as if that made him some kind of `` exception . '', 
  he could have stopped , claimed asylum , and stayed with his kid . 
  for example , that guy the journalist kicked was running from the police while crying , `` baby !, 
  baby ! '', 
  [ video 's here ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/sep/08/journalist-appears-to-kick-and-trip-fleeing-refugees-video ) i 'm not justifying kicking him , but he seemed to feel he should be allowed to run away from the cop who grabbed him because , hey , he 's got a baby . 
   i 'm sorry you had that experience . 
  actually , as a whole , living in those places was a positive experience . 
  no region is perfect , of course . 
  but to answer your question ... this is really long , but you asked !, 
  :-) thing is those established communities are made of individuals , and ( at least in my experience ) on average they 're much more conservative than even religious conservative europeans . 
  i worry how many are really a good fit for the societies they 're entering . 
  and it 's hard to believe those who are n't a good fit will be sent home when it 's safe again . 
  anyway , about gender roles , it did n't feel absolutely barred from things and i certainly was n't treated as less valuable , but i felt i had to always consider what 's `` appropriate '' for a woman versus for a man . 
  i felt too much * difference * between roles for men and women . 
  for example , my co-residents ( long-term guest house ) teased me for shaking hands with a man and threatened to tell my boyfriend that i cheated . 
  they were just playing , but it 's very conservative , religious thinking . 
  or when you 're expected to sit in the back of the taxi because sitting in the front can give the driver `` the wrong idea . '', 
  or people who think it 's `` shameful '' for a man to do housework . 
  ( seems this is mostly the older generation , though . ), 
  or when you 're advised not to wait for someone outside because a woman standing alone , even during the day in normal clothes , `` looks like a prostitute . '', 
  or how men will not enter a home ( eg . 
  to collect rent ) with a woman alone because the woman might be afraid or neighbors might see and `` suspect something . '', 
  ( of course , i understand men do this from respect . ), 
  i do n't think these things are * inherently * bad and , in fact , plenty of women prefer them . 
  also , in some ways , women are treated * better . 
  * so , it 's really just personal preference . 
  but i personally found it very constrictive , probably because i was n't raised with those ideas . 
  in regard to contact , i just do n't know . 
  i 'm not sure that will help . 
  i 've lived in the middle/near east ( mostly turkey and georgia , also armenia and jordan ) . 
  around six years all total . 
  my main issue is that i felt strict gender roles were * suffocating * in all these places except armenia . 
  i felt like i had to consider my gender ( female ) in nearly everything i did . 
  so , if i have `` negative feelings , '' that 's why . 
  yes , there are many wonderful , kind , intelligent people in these cultures and there are things i like about `` middle eastern culture '' in general ( greater hospitality , for example ) , but as a whole , i do n't prefer to live there . 
  so , in my case , greater contact did n't help . 
  oh , yes , of course we 're still friends . 
  the present is built on the past . 
  i 've travelled a fair bit and it 's always good to meet poles abroad . 
  once in tbilisi , georgia , i was looking at a flat for rent . 
  i assumed the owner was georgian . 
  she asked me where i normally lived and when i said budapest , she seemed really excited and said , `` eg\u00e9szs\u00e9gedre ! '', 
  when i looked confused she said , `` i 'm polish ! '', 
  ( just happened to know a few hungarian words . ), 
  then we were like insta-friends . 
  just another example . 
  thank you !, 
  yeah , i was going to say ... 
  but then `` viking '' was in quotes , so i thought maybe that also included , say , magnus ' wife who just stayed home knitting while hubby was out raping and pillaging . 
  or trading . 
  whatever . 
  so perhaps the quotes were meant to suggest not every individual in the country was involved . 
  it 's so sad how teleki ended . 
  he really tried . 
  yes , i knew about the poles who came during wwii . 
  glad they had somewhere to go . 
  and going back further , there 's jozef bem , of course . 
  thanks for the link !, 
  we also have some memorials , like this [ memorial to the city of szczecin ] ( http://21.kerulet.ittlakunk.hu/civil/131211/szent-imre-teren-elevenitettuk-fel-regi-baratsagot-lengyelekkel ) for showing solidarity during ' 56 . 
  apparently there 's also a memorial in szczecin . 
   and even hours of some events . 
  doing better than i am , then . 
   and i hope you remember us !, 
  :-) we try !, 
   you 're talking like you do n't know how to drink . 
  i do n't !, 
  two shots of vodka is my limit . 
  after three , i can only laugh , not speak . 
  but you have a point . 
  in future , i 'll assume they 're all slightly drunk , just be sure . 
  they probably have to drink to tolerate our chattiness . 
  you 're not stealing anything . 
  :-) poles also [ donated blood ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungary%e2%80%93poland_relations#revolution_of_1956 ) to help hungary in ' 56 .
