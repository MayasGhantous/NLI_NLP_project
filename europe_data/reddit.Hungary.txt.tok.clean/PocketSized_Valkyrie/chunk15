  do n't know if you knew that , but thanks !, 
  at first i was n't sure if that was a polarbear joke or a prostitute joke ... 
  okay , i got it . 
   bear cost in finland 6 eur . 
  is that per kilo or per bear ? 
  ( sorry , sorry ... ) but yes , price difference could could explain it . 
  now if we could just establish a ferryline to helsinki ... 
  not particularly quiet when sober , either , i 've noticed . 
  well , at least the tourists are n't . 
  or maybe they * were * drunk , but i did n't notice . 
  or maybe we 're a bad influence . 
  could be . 
  so misconception more than ( or in addition to ) misinformation . 
  i 'm sure for the actual refugees , war trauma and culture shock also contribute , but in any case , for many people `` ideal does n't match up with what they get '' seems to be a big part of it . 
  but * what * do they reply : `` piss off , asshat ? '', 
  i was politely conversing with a nice bavarian boy for a while , but we could never manage to meet and then ... i kind of stopped writing . 
  so , distance is the bigger problem there . 
   then throw up in horror well , if you used vodka instead of pills you could blame it on that ... 
   ( probably nonexistent ) future grandchildren thanks for the vote of confidence , man . 
  anyway , making polite conversation with average-looking foreigners has n't worked . 
  have to research some ethnic jokes . 
  `` how do you sink a dutch submarine ? '', 
  and so on . 
  popular method in budapest seems to be `` ride a bike past a woman as while calling out ` you 're really pretty ! ', 
  then peddle faster to escape before she can talk to you . 
  alternatively , find a woman sitting/standing alone and chat . 
  or find someone at work . 
  my method has been to start writing to a guy on a dating site , then decide he could never really want me , then stop writing and complain that no one wants me . 
  sell out !, 
  oh , i sympathize with that . 
  i had four years of not being allowed to work ( legally , obviously ) . 
  it was hell . 
  but the smugglers lies certainly are not helping ; they are adding to the problem . 
  it seems at least part of the problem is misinformation . 
  heaven only knows what the smugglers tell them . 
  then they get out-dated info from other migrants , such as `` finland has shorter waiting times , '' which may have been true * back when * they were n't getting so many people . 
  i think the danish government 's adverts providing the facts ( [ this ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34173542 ) ) was a good idea . 
  i 'm neutral about it , just surprised someone has the patience to type everything twice unless the canadian government makes them . 
  have to respect his persistence , though . 
  okay , i was wondering . 
  yes , i 've noticed the bilingual posts that look like they come from / r/canada . 
  hmph . 
  but we still have more people !, 
  for now ... 
  * french ? 
  * is that true ? 
  it would n't make sense . 
  according to [ wiki 's admittedly dubious stats ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_the_european_union#knowledge ) , there are more speakers of german . 
  on that basis , one slavic language should be allowed , too . 
   so it should be rightful property of the grand finno-ugric empire prepare the horses/reindeer !, 
  we might need a tank or something , too ... 
   they ca n't accept it and they do n't have enough money on their own to do something useful . 
  this is so sad . 
  probably why the earlier attempt to help them from here did n't go anywhere . 
  i misunderstood . 
  well , yes , maybe , but i think the support would be more so from `` linguistic solidarity '' than `` because orb\u00e1n said so . '', 
  ah , so estonia * and * hungary should invade russia . 
  sounds good !, 
  / s but seriously , supporting a newspaper is not equivalent to invading and taking over a chunk of land . 
  thanks !, 
  glad to hear they have something . 
  there 's [ this radio station ] ( http://mari-el-radio.ru/ ) , too . 
  no clue what dialect that is . 
  ( just looked for it again because i remembered finding one years ago . ), 
   does n't russia have laws against outside financing ? 
  oh , they might . 
  i do n't know . 
  you have a good point , though . 
  no , people here care !, 
  but not enough people are really * aware * of finno-ugric people in russia . 
  i try to inform people , but again , it 's a matter of `` what can we do ? '', 
  ( besides spread awareness . ), 
  if they just needed money to run a newspaper , that would be easier , but it 's a political thing . 
  apparently this has been going on for some time . 
  i remember hearing the last mari-language newspaper was forcibly closed , but ca n't find any good references now . 
  wiki has [ something about mari el newspapers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mari_el#politics ) , but unreferenced . 
  there was some push to help them then ( about 5-6 years ago , i think ) , but it did n't seem to go anywhere . 
  that 's why i said `` some '' of us . 
  :-) but i would be surprised at teachers getting the same as even a starting engineer . 
  engineering is a highly paid , well respected profession and teaching is generally seen as something for `` people 's wives to make a little grocery money . '', 
  ( not fair , but ... ) well , anyway , if they 're paying their teachers a decent salary , that 's good . 
   thats seems awfully low . 
  i think just as it 's hard for you to see how that 's possible , it 's hard for some of us to believe a mere teacher could earn 3.849 euro/mo . 
  well , at least for me . 
  according to [ this not-quite official source i quickly skimmed ] ( http://www.sulihalo.hu/pedagogus/pedagogusok-foruma/6091-2015-tol-novekedne-jelentosen-a-pedagogusok-bere ) a hungarian teacher 's gross pay tops out at around 1.500 $ / mo. 
  i can easily believe it 's lower farther east , but with 3.849 euro , it feels like there must be some ... catch or something . 
  well , i was with you for the first point ... 
   their applications are rejected quickly . 
  well , darn . 
  an austrian friend of mine was threatening to request asylum in switzerland because `` we [ austrians ] are poor compared to them ! '', 
  if austria [ declared hungary unsafe ] ( http://budapestbeacon.com/public-policy/austrian-courts-hungary-not-safe-for-asylum-seekers/27303 ) , i do n't see why switzerland ca n't do the same for poor austria . 
  and belgium for the netherlands . 
  and sweden for denmark ... 
  yeah , i was wondering if your area has a big problem with people worshiping odin in the oak groves or something ... and that * is * native . 
  but okay , it 's clearer now . 
  for preventing kids being born with genetic diseases ? 
  i do n't mean abortion , but for example , if you carry the cystic fibrosis gene , do n't have kids with someone who also has the gene . 
  or do you mean something else ? 
  but are those ones even muslim or actually atheists with muslim parents ? 
  this is just anecdotal evidence , of course , but the people i know from izmir are liberal , yes , but they 're atheists not muslims .
