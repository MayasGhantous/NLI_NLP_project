  for example , i know a guy from izmir who said he `` hates islam '' -- that was his word , `` hate '' -- but has `` muslim '' in his passport because he says he would have trouble finding a job and such if he did n't . 
  aw , you beat me to it !, 
  it 's not like the two have no history together ... 
  yes , if austria did n't , they 'd just walk . 
  some also manage to move on from germany to sweden and finland , so it 's not just germany suffering . 
  i know , but it was a reply to the `` ceremonial nukes '' comment above . 
  fine , ceremonial mass graves . 
  * happy now ? 
  have you asked the embassy if they 'll let you pick it up in person ? 
  and if so , how long you 'd have to wait in paris ? 
  or just ask in general what they recommend for your situation . 
  ceremonial funerals . 
  c'mon man , this continent has n't had a war for , like what , almost two months now ? 
  we 're doing great !, 
  well , you 're still the only ones with a monochrome bar . 
  with syrians specifically ? 
  i stayed in a syrian-refugee-run hostel ( not camp ) in istanbul last year , does that count ? 
  it was a positive experience . 
  however , people are individuals , so i do n't feel there is a `` the refugees '' monolith . 
   same here :( thank you for doing it , though . 
  so , in other words , eesti can into siberia ? 
   hungarians yelling `` isten a kiraly '' on the streets i can just imagine ... ( although at first i read that as `` istv\u00e1n a kir\u00e1ly ) to add , we also have a bunch of ukrainians right now . 
  oh , `` but they are n't * real * refugees because they work . '', 
  never mind that they were running from a war . 
  i just get tired of repeating these points . 
  aw , but swedes are genetically special , too !, 
  check [ the chart on this page ] ( http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2008/09/01/european-genes-mirror-european-geography/ ) ( second image with the blue bars . ), 
  admittedly , their data is n't the best , but still . 
  i like veddy much ze wooman !, 
  personal servants ? 
  yeah , no . 
  wow . 
  okay , you win . 
  :-) but we 're here if you need any kayaks ... 
  be nice , now , you might some help building a wall soon !, 
  or we could send you horses because you ca n't ride reindeer into battle ... 
  the forest-y part of mongolia ? 
  okay . 
  i have n't tried many sherries , so i just do n't know much about them . 
   people having some recent ancestors that 's what i thought . 
  i would be more `` guess my ethnicity . '', 
  have you ever seen the [ composite faces of europe ] ( http://www.theapricity.com/forum/attachment.php?s=2141608c2e8e194bafdcc93e495ccb2a&amp;attachmentid=37210&amp;d=1378664398 ) maps ? 
  those are interesting . 
  yeah , you 'd think they 'd first learn a little something about the people they want to `` teach a lesson '' to . 
  i know very little about wine at all . 
  i 'm probably just thinking of spanish sherry . 
  i want to say because i prefer hungarian wines , but i actually like vodka better . 
  is there spanish vodka ? 
  but yes , reputation . 
  i think of spanish wines as sweet ( although i know not all are ) and i 'm not a fan of sweet wines . 
   competition for cartoons that mocked christians and jews ` to show them what it feels like ' that 's just absurd . 
  there are literally centuries ' worth of cartoons mocking jews and perhaps christians , too . 
  to assume they/we do n't know `` what it feels like '' suggests extreme ignorance . 
  edit : however , if they * really * do n't know the problems both jews and christians have had , maybe if they learned , they would have more sympathy * and * understand why everyone rolls their eyes when they get offended about a cartoon . 
  no worries , i just wanted to tease you because of the tesla thing !, 
   austria : mozart austria : [ * not * mozart ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mozart's_nationality ) . 
  `` salzburgian '' is probably best . 
  i 'll be really bad at this : austria : christina st\u00fcrmer , werner faymann , and ... can i count people i know ? 
  armenia : arthur meschian , armenchik , elon sarafian denmark : mads langer , thor bager , and the guys from nephew . 
  oh , and that chick who kissed the guy from nephew -- marie something ? 
  finland : jenni vartiainen , toni virtanen , samuli edelmann germany : angela merkel , der graf ( sort of a name ) , and nena poland : sylwia grzeszczak ( had to look up the spelling ) , ola , lech wa\u0142esa russia : viktor sukhorukov , yuri shevchuk , and the guys from nautilus pompilius ukraine : slava vakarchuk , andriy markiv , yulia tymoshenko okay , i 'm done . 
  i think he meant `` women 's names '' seems to be the theme . 
  so `` euro trash '' should have been `` council flat fiona '' or something . 
  offensive to someone * more specific . 
  * ( actually , after re-reading , that 's probably not what he meant , but that would have been logical . ), 
  well , if you want to play migrant ping pong , i 'm sure someone in the balkans can send you a copy of the rulebook . 
  that 's exactly why some countries have [ sexual assistants ] ( https://www.myhandicap.com/en/information-disability-chonical-illness/relationships-and-sexuality/sexuality-and-disability/sexual-assistance-for-disabled-people/ ) for people with certain disabilities . 
  although they do n't have full , actual sex . 
  so , hey , this problem is mostly solved !, 
  sorry , i was n't quoting you personally , just the idea of trying to get rid of guilt . 
  for example , if i break my neighbor 's window and feel guilty , i pay for the window and try not to break it again . 
  i do n't try to prove i 'm a nice guy by holding football matches for disadvantaged kids in my lawn . 
  that 's nice , but it puts the remaining windows at further risk . 
  but your explanation sounds like it 's just an attempt to get praise from the largest political/ethnic/whatever group possible at the expense of the minorities . 
  not saying it 's true , but that would be even worse . 
   its because of post ww2 guilt . 
  i just do n't see how anyone can think it 's good pr to `` make up for '' killing jews and gays by inviting in people who have a reputation for hating jews and gays . 
  i said this before here and someone answered me that germans feel guilty * subconsciously * and just have some vague feeling having to help all people . 
  in other words , they 're incapable of thinking logically about `` persecuted people . '', 
  yeah ... i do n't think so . 
  i used to have a mostly-german neighbor who came only on holidays and i never knew exactly when she was home . 
  so i could usually play somewhat loud music knowing there was no one close enough to hear . 
  one day , i did that -- armenian zurna music , no less -- and she blasted me with wagnerian opera . 
  i quickly turned down my music and she turned down hers . 
  then i laughed for five minutes straight . 
  we were friends anyway , so no one was offended , but i thought her strategy was hilarious . 
  they * want * into central ? 
  then we should let them in . 
  next , denmark can into central !, 
  and salmon , apparently . 
  not sure how the baltics ended up in central europe , unless i 'm reading the `` cultural proximities '' wrong . 
   nicely crumbled historical buildings a late british friend of mine , who would be around 70 now , said he liked budapest because it reminded him of london not long after the war . 
  you know , i once got into an internet argument with someone who * claimed * to be finnish and * insisted * that finland is not nordic . 
  even after i said i understand nordic / = scandinavian , that the language/culture is different , etc. 
  in the end , i just gave up . 
  maybe he was just trolling , but it confused me . 
  a 92 % tolerance for working with no-good stoner hippies ? 
  well , amsterdam , i suppose . 
  ( just teasing !, 
  in the middle of the photo , farthest left of the boys ?
