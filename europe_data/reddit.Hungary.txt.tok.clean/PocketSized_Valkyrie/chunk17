  i noticed that . 
  i 'm sure it 's just the camera/lighting , but he looks like a badly made wax figure . 
  how far east ? 
  in my experience , in ukraine , sure . 
  in georgia and armenia , you can use it with pretty much everyone over age 35-ish , but not so much with younger people . 
  in bulgaria , you can basically communicate , but only because the languages are similar enough . 
  any farther west , though , not really . 
  english or german . 
  no idea , statistically . 
  i have n't noticed a lot of obvious buddhists wandering around , though . 
  well , you could come here and study . 
  closer than china !, 
  how unfortunate . 
  but i can understand not wanting to work with someone like that ( of any religion ) . 
  interesting . 
  that could be it . 
  here there are quite a lot of chinese and some people are wary of them -- not them personally , but the fact there so many . 
  that was the only thing i could thing of . 
  `` too many chinese around ! '', 
  i suspect people associate buddhism with the chinese . 
  i know , right ?!, 
  i was rather disappointed the survey did n't ask about neopagans . 
  oh , there are people who genuinely do n't like islam . 
  but people seem to forget there are arab christians and lots of chinese are atheists , so answering by presumed ethnicity messes up the stats . 
  although , the last buddhist i worked with was * obnoxiously * well organized . 
  that bastard !, 
  oh , this is useful . 
  thanks !, 
  what 's with all the buddhist hate in central europe , though , guys ? 
  i 'd assume it 's dislike of asians , more than dislike of buddhists . 
  horrible . 
  condolences to turkey . 
  the police in istanbul seem really careful in regards to terrorist threats , and i imagine ankara police are , too . 
  unfortunately , they missed one . 
  too late . 
  i read that and thought `` what , and christians persecuting the pagans was a * good * thing ? '', 
  i 'm hardly the only one who is n't surprised gell\u00e9rt ( proselytizing monk ) got thrown off a cliff . 
  that said , at this point i 'd rather we not all try to kill each other over religion again .

  i 'm usually not a big fan of visual arts , but some of his work , especially images of vilnius , i could just look at forever . 
  it 's so evocative . 
  no offense , but i also question the source . 
  not saying it 's okay to beat foreigners , but why would n't she tell him in czech that she 's not a foreigner in order to protect herself ? 
  also people like this guy do n't want to import * more * people who harass others because of their clothes . 
  it 's kind of like `` they do it , so i can do it back to them . '', 
  now all of europe `` can into nordic '' !, 
  i quite like the blue background with the white-outlined black cross . 
  i 'll claim that for my queendom . 
  it 's much appreciated !, 
  aw , but yours is beautiful , too . 
  also very clean and elegant . 
  i like all the nordic cross flags , actually , i just prefer cool colors . 
  although i prefer denmark 's to sweden 's , so ... i do n't know . 
  but how can someone not know the world 's most beautiful flag ?!, 
  :-) ( and thank you . ), 
  i knew it was mostly ice , but i did n't know how it got the name . 
  oh well , at least some people * tried * to have a green flag . 
  maybe they have more red sun than green plants . 
  to me , though , green just looks better . 
  finland 's because it 's so clean and simple . 
  estonia 's has a good color scheme , too . 
  two of the flags greenland decided against : [ this one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/2nd_proposal_by_andersson.svg/131px-2nd_proposal_by_andersson.svg.png ) and [ this one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/achen_greenland_flag_proposal.svg/132px-achen_greenland_flag_proposal.svg.png ), 
  okay , less kebab for you . 
  apparently `` puli '' in hungarian comes from `` poodle , '' so probably no connection . 
  although , i 'm very happy to learn such an important finnish word . 
  of course not smaller , * bigger . 
  * you * sure * you do n't want southern sweden back ? 
  and estonia ? 
  you know there * people * living in europe , right ? 
  hey , i do n't mind sharing a border with poland , but the slovaks might have some complaints about being obliterated . 
  armenia 's eastern border looks fine , but the western border should be * much * farther west . 
  much . 
  i thought it was estonia . 
  eta : no , but estonia is high on the list , according to [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/importance_of_religion_by_country ) .

  yes , you 're quite welcome .

  something similar happened to me on a seaside holiday , but when i was about 12 years old . 
  opened the cabin door and the wind pulled it with me attached , slammed me against the wall and dropped me about a meter to the ground . 
  fun times . 
   what 's the best way to go about learning russian ? 
  for me , just having to use it all the time . 
  i lived in georgia with people who spoke only georgian and russian . 
  after all , cases affect meaning , so you have to use them ( mostly ) correctly to communicate . 
  when you talk with people , you can learn through trial and error , and eventually develop an instinct . 
  mind , i started as a kid and used the language before living in georgia , but was n't especially comfortable/fluent with it . 
  oh , and russian pop music . 
   learning slavic languages is easy after one right ? 
  maybe `` it depends . '', 
  i 'm finding ukrainian difficult to * speak * even when i can understand because i mix it up with russian so much . 
  however , i have n't spent much time trying . 
  i like them , but like the sound of ukrainian best . 
  i think they sound better than the romance languages , actually . 
  i can only tell what 's russian , what 's ukrainian and what is n't . 
  russian is incredibly useful because it 's so widely spoken by people who know where to find things for cheap and the shared vocabulary helps you understand other slavic languages . 
  yeah , i was surprised to see that when i visited serbia . 
  it 's a hungarian word that literally means `` yellow root/tuber , '' but we spell it s\u00e1rgar\u00e9pa . 
  as u/embicek said , it 's an on-going problem . 
  they re-instated visas for hungarian citizens , too , because of asylum claims and removed them only when hungary joined the eu .
