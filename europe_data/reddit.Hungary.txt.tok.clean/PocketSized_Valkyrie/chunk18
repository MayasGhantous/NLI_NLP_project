  i do n't know , i like hun-angry better than hungry . 
  sounds a little more impressive . 
  i would n't think so . 
  most ukrainians are pretty okay with russians , even now . 
  a certain other nation , however ... 
  but i do n't want to name names . 
  sorry , just some dark humour . 
  the boar do n't * really * glow , i just found it interesting that animals so far from that area are still picking up measurable radioactivity , believed to be from chernobyl . 
  and do they glow in the dark like the [ wild boar in saxony ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/11068298/radioactive-wild-boar-roaming-the-forests-of-germany.html ) ? 
  * but if they 're healthy enough to reproduce that 's a good start . 
  just wonder about their life spans . 
  the photos are lovely . 
  * ^ do n't ^ actually ^ glow, 
  lviv is very nice , as well as quite inexpensive . 
  i 'm sure it 's cheaper than prague , although i do n't know about flight/train costs . 
  but you 'd need to start booking by late october-ish if not now . 
  i think vienna 's been doing [ just fine ] ( http://www.tasteofaustria.org/coffee/ ) so far . 
  was n't that the denmark-sweden debate , which was held in denmark ( because ... reasons ) ? 
  i could be completely wrong here ... 
  fairly certain that 's boel godner , mayor of s\u00f6dert\u00e4lje , during the debate on the migrant issue . 
  i think , anyway . 
  yeah , okay , but sudetenland was germanic before it was slavic , so ... \\ #justliterallyhitlerthings / s etc. 
  your [ southern neighbours ] ( http://www.espon.eu/export/sites/default/images/publications/mapsofthemonth/mom_february2013/semigra_high-quality.png ) seem to have it even worse . 
  v\u00f6lkisch paganism 's not uncommon . 
  it makes sense in that they want to go back to their national roots and define those roots by race . 
  * hmm * possible . 
  or they just do n't think things through . 
  i was once at a dinner party where someone stopped that argument ( from a straight man ) simply by asking `` who * taught * you to like girls ? '', 
  i think some people worry that having openly gay people walking around will `` turn '' straight people to gay . 
  so they 're a `` bad influence on the children . '', 
  well , that was kind of sad . 
  the gender ratio difference is interesting , too . 
  `` in the 30 - to 39-year-old age group there 's a drastic difference between east and west , caused by the migration of a large number of young east german women in the 1990s and early 2000s . '', 
  i 've heard a theory that the lack of women in the east is contributing to so many angry right-leaning men , but i have no idea if that 's true . 
  yeah , i know . 
  i was there last year . 
  i had some trouble and was amazed at how helpful and kind people were to me , * even though * , they 're overwhelmed with refugees . 
  i think similar culture helps , though . 
  i was talking with a jordanian guy about refugees , etc. 
  and mentioned that armenia took in lots of ethnic armenians from iraq , but those were `` their own people . '', 
  he said , `` well , syrians * are * ` our people . ', 
  we 're all arabs . '', 
  and added how the borders are artificial anyway . 
  but , of course , it 's still a strain on their economy and infrastructure . 
  oh , i know he 's no saint , but jordan 's still israel 's most peaceful neighbour , is n't it ? 
  that 's not saying much , but it 's relative . 
   jordan do n't know if you 're joking , but i would n't mind seeing it go to the king of jordan . 
  except that some people know * because * they 've seen it . 
  this happened with the [ iveria hotel ] ( http://coolsandfools.com/radisson-blu-iveria-hotel-georgia/ ) in tbilisi with idps from abkhazia , and that was their own country . 
  it 's understandable , really . 
  first , they 're too poor and exhausted to care for property even if they want to . 
  also , many are angry they 've lost everything and frustrated by not being able to rebuilt their lives , so they take out their anger on what 's around them -- walls , furniture , etc. 
  i do n't consider those georgian idps `` bad people '' at all , but they were put in a terrible situation . 
  i actually do have some sympathy for the people complaining about bad food , etc. 
  because i saw the same thing in georgia * in 2008 * with another wave of idps complaining about unhcr 's hebs . 
  although , there are differences , of course . 
  there 's probably some government rebate or tax break , though , to help with the cost . 
  and/or maybe the law is n't in effect for a few years , so they have some time . 
  also , moss is plant and it 's pretty cheap . 
  the main problem i see is plants and , mostly , the dirt and water , or solar panels , are heavy . 
  if a roof ca n't support the weight , it will need reinforcement and that could be the big expense here . 
  well , we sort of have this . 
  we just call it steampunk . 
   the mari language has been exposed to russian sure , i assumed that 's why . 
  just interesting because they 're supposedly a `` close '' relative . 
  add `` go '' ( menn\u00e4 and menni ) and `` under '' ( alla and alatt ) and i think probably el\u00e4v\u00e4 and eleven ( lively ) have some connection . 
  that 's all i know . 
  oh wait , someone here recently suggested isten ( god ) and is\u00e4 may also be related . 
  greeks and hebrews ? 
  this has been going on for thousands of years . 
  hmm . 
  yeah , i can see that . 
  that song has kind of bounce , too . 
  ( you know tankcsapsa ?! ), 
  have you heard the [ mari language ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sciiloxqve ) ? 
  also finno-ugric , but i ca n't understand that , either . 
  sounds like something slavic to me . 
  i know , i 'm from here . 
  o_o . 
  i 'm just saying i hear more `` pro-jew '' talk from the right . 
  of course , what i know about the left is mostly from the media and probably not quite accurate . 
  hahahahahaha !, 
  not even close . 
  seems to be a few random words . 
  so many taxi drivers have asked me this when i tell them where i 'm from , then did n't believe me because they `` read in a book '' that we 're related . 
  * sigh * edit : i do n't mind the question * at all * , just people not believing . 
  so we 're just used to it , but in the west it 's growing and they 're not used to it ? 
  could be . 
  hurrah !, 
  we 're not alone this time !, 
  it 's `` k\u00e9z , '' though . 
  \u00e9 is like `` ai '' in `` plain . '', 
  i do n't think it 's the right . 
  nearly all my friends are right-leaning , some quite hard right . 
  and there are n't that many muslims here . 
  it 's the left that worries me more . 
  and there are n't that many leftists here . 
  by `` right , '' though , i do n't mean rabid half-crazed neo-nazies with swastika tattoos , but just right-leaning . 
  was this originally found nailed to the door of a french catholic church ? 
  `` the french are * pluralists * ! '',
