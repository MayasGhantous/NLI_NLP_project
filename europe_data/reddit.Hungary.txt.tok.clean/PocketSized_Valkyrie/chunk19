  first dog food , now this . 
  edit : / s just in case that 's necessary, 
  i had n't noticed that . 
   slavs well ... a lot of ( most that i 've heard ) russians and ukrainians ca n't do umlauts , though . 
  for example , they say yo for \u00f6 as in bryotchen . 
  otherwise , i agree with you . 
  thanks for that !, 
  surely you mean football . 
  :-p ( i 'll add kayaking and canoeing , and maybe fencing . ), 
  well , that explains why it makes no sense . 
  it 's just very unfortunate . 
  i absolutely do n't understand how people can say this is about `` nazi guilt . '', 
  ( first , let me clarify i * do not * think today 's generation should feel guilty . 
  they 're not to blame for their grandparents . ), 
  theoretically , though , if a person felt guilty about that , they 'd want to * protect * jews , not drive them out of the country . 
  the current situation only makes people think germany 's still full of nazis . 
  i 'm * not * saying it is , but that 's certainly one potential conspiracy theory . 
  i do n't pretend to know what 's going on , but i do n't think it 's guilt-related at all . 
  thanks !, 
  i saw the post at 3 am and was way too tired to analyze anything . 
  comment on that article says his facebook page has an `` explanation '' . 
  i do n't read norwegian . 
  ca n't link to facebook here , apparently , but if you google ola lysgaard the page is easy to find . 
  i was notified my previous message was removed , but i still see it ... 
   if you go somewhere where taxi licensing is not strictly controlled , you 'll find yourself getting ripped off and will have to be very careful of your safety . 
  probably depends on culture . 
  when i lived in georgia and armenia ( several years each ) , there were * a lot * of unlicensed taxis , but i never had a problem with prices , being cheated , being harassed or anything . 
  occasional heavy flirting was the only `` problem . '', 
  in fact , there were lots of cheap taxis everywhere . 
  the only place i ever had trouble with taxi drivers was a particular city where the taxis were licensed , but they were absolutely * horrible * . 
  it does n't to you ? 
  it sounds `` soft '' to me , too , although ukrainian and polish sound softer . 
  but seriously , though , speaking of racists , i once had to explain to someone that `` skinhead '' is not just a synonym for `` bald . '', 
   my sky is darker than thine yeah , that song ( `` song ? '' ), 
  and a few more firecrackers should scare off the rest of your unwanted migrants . 
  nothing personal !, 
  on the bright side , you have an actual economy ... 
   it wo n't be dark for long still ... [ no tea , no bars ] ( http://news.yahoo.com/finlands-no-good-disappointed-migrants-turn-back-152042061.html ) . 
  should they melt snow to drink ? 
  hey , now !, 
  at least we 're not dark and cold . 
  1 / i know a guy who won the green card lottery , went to some ghetto part of philadelphia , then came back to complain that `` america is dirty and dangerous . '', 
  years later , we still laugh at him for it . 
  ( i mean for the generalization of a whole , huge country . ), 
  4 / fly into copenhagen . 
  best airport ever !, 
  also have to say , budapest * really is * prettier than vienna . 
  edit : corrected the numbering . 
   taboo deformation i wonder if that 's how `` farkas '' happened from the word tail -- calling it `` the tailed thing , '' even though lots of other animals have tails . 
  and bear is just `` medve '' from the slavic . 
  i would think . 
  they 're definitely up there financially . 
  surprised liechtenstein 's not there . 
  have you tried the white-pine meat balls ? 
  * mmm * :-p, 
  but that was mostly austria running everything . 
  we like each other , of course , but ... it 's just more of an equal relationship with poland . 
  [ us version ] ( http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/departments/food/ ) -- so some have food . 
  ours have had at least the food section for 15-ish years . 
  i remember super-excitedly dragging my then-husband there the first time i saw it . 
  they do n't where you live ? 
  ours have them , too . 
  there 's a food section , a restaurant and a little cafe place for coffee and donuts . 
  [ ikea food , uk version ] ( http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/categories/departments/food/ ), 
   a great and unique heritage is something to be proud of . 
  i agree , but i may be slightly biased ... 
   do szabli , i do szklanki . 
  hopefully more of the latter . 
  someone recently posted about the german government [ sending back serbs ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/balkan-migrant-returnees-face-tough-times/a-18746419 ) because they 've declared serbia safe . 
  so , if that 's true ... also ,  a negligent greece that has failed to enforce eu rules on migrants i think most people can see greece is simply overwhelmed , not willfully negligent . 
  poland , probably . 
  i was going to say if this tracks genetic heritage for health reasons , that 's valid reason that 's not bigoted . 
  but then i read the page . 
  yeah , that 's ... yeah . 
  i only knew nemets came from nemoi , but i did n't know it used to mean any non-slavic foreigner or that there was a word for slavic foreigners . 
  thanks !, 
  thanks !, 
  learned something new . 
  thanks !, 
  interesting , i did n't know it was used that way in the past . 
   in russian the word for any foreigner \u0418\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0446 ? 
  what word are you thinking of ? 
  i 've never heard \u041d\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0446 use for anything other than german , but then i 've never lived in russia . 
  no , remember it was [ allowing them to ride the trains ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/hungary-s-migrant-policies-like-nazi-deportations-faymann-1.2349998 ) they demanded access to that made us all `` dark times re-enactors . '', 
   in whatever private properties he owns that 's on the continent where he actually lives . 
  i would n't know . 
  you 'll have to ask an austrian . 
  here we have a proper evil fascist fence \u2122 . 
  it 's not a fence , it 's a [ `` technical barrier '' ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-austria-iduskcn0sl2jw20151027 ) . 
  completely , * completely * different from a fence . 
  because reasons . 
  hmm . 
  yes , according to [ p. 5 of this oecd pisa results chart ] ( https://www.oecd.org/pisa/keyfindings/pisa-2012-results-overview.pdf ) , you did . 
  it also says switzerland got 531 and liechtenstein got 535 . 
  edit : oh , wait , this is eu-only . 
  but still , you should be on there . 
  georgia and armenian also do n't . 
  both countries of europe . 
  ( ( hugs ) ) although i may not be the best source of anti-depression hugs ... 
  i think you missed georgia in your list .
