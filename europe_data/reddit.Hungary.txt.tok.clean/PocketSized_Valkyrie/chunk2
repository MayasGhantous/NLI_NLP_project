  i think i heard a [ different version ] ( http://users.wfu.edu/price/housekeeper.html ) . 
  but you would leave the migrants and replace their weight with alcohol , no ? 
  but even so , it would probably be too crowded on the way there anyway ... 
  you do n't allow non-finns on your ferries ?!, 
  that 's mean !, 
  / s / jk i 'm just saying it 's nice of finland not to try to push people into the baltics . 
  of course , they probably would n't go ... 
  at least s/he did n't suggest an express ferry to estonia . 
  thanks !, 
  i have n't really looked into it much . 
  i only know russian and can understand a fair amount of ukrainian , but ukrainian seems to have a lot in common with polish , so i thought i 'd try a guess . 
  guessing is sometimes dangerous . 
  hey , good !, 
  i watched it ages ago , but remember it was pretty good . 
  honestly , i thought that was the excuse . 
  `` well , mama , he 's ... um , he 's gone to the countryside for a while . 
  needs some rest , you see . '', 
  both the `` soviet '' part and the `` good terms '' part . 
  well , we 're not launching rockets at each other , so ... 
  thanks !, 
  i do n't speak polish , so i just tried to make a guess based on other slavic-language knowledge . 
  that was very kind of him . 
  title says he went to the countryside ? 
  reminds me of [ goodbye , lenin !, 
  ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0301357/ ) where the family tries to protect their ill mother from news of the changes in east germany . 
  all 99 of them . 
  you make a good point . 
  finno-ugors for the win !, 
  ( italics mine ) that makes sense then . 
  i had a neighbour with that name and assumed it meant `` pig raiser '' = `` pig farmer . '', 
  but it does sound quite funny . 
   they will form a vote bank and keep on electing people who promise them more and more free stuff . 
  '' [ democracy ] can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury . '', 
  -- [ alexander fraser tytler ] ( http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/108530-a-democracy-cannot-exist-as-a-permanent-form-of-government ) not sure i agree 100 % , but i thought i 'd put that out there in case you have n't heard the quote . 
  but not really . 
  food poisoning will pass and there 's little a doctor can do , so just rest , i suppose . 
  but you know hungarians are n't slavs , right ? 
  i should have said `` not ethnic slavic '' but i wrote that at , like , 2 am and was half asleep . 
  anyway , i have n't been murdering any neighbours recently , either . 
  - russian almost exclusively everywhere - `` oh , sorry , ukrainian ? '', 
  after i say i 'm not russian - estonian , distant third i 'm not blonde or blue-eyed or have any slavic blood , but i 've traveled mostly in the caucuses and the `` near east '' where most of the paler white people are russian , so i think that 's why . 
  i was wondering what i said that 's cunty , but i * did * reply to someone saying i did n't mention cultural differences were an issue when resettling muslims in poland because i did n't want to be called a fascist . 
  i suppose that was it . 
  ukraine also knew . 
  sevastopal 's been an issue for ages . 
  true , of course , but the metro was slowed more by politics than by difficulty of construction . 
  thanks !, 
  i * just * read something about this and was looking for more information . 
  i do n't know . 
  i ca n't seem to find any photos ... 
  really ? 
  i did n't count , i just remember it seemed the scaffolding was there * forever . 
  i see . 
  thanks for the reply !, 
  honestly , i 'm amazed . 
  it took , like , five years to wash the parliament building and about as many to build the forth metro line in budapest , although that was slowed due to politics . 
  any idea why it 's so expensive ? 
  because it 's mostly imports ? 
   you cant argue against thousands of years of history i know , but people try ... 
  yes , but if you say that , then everyone calls you an evil , racist fascist . 
  that 's why i did n't even mention culture . 
  no , tbilisi . 
  she just did n't like studying . 
  she `` studied '' russian in school like everyone else , but ca n't really use it . 
  she understood only the basics . 
  this is why we did n't want her wandering off to some other country . 
  she had no sense of practicality . 
  i think he 's referring to a [ * specific * fence ] ( http://images.hvg.hu/image.aspx?id=cd6fd8fe-c588-4b97-876f-d58037393955&amp;view=7fcefbf8-ac48-4ee6-aef5-32203afa118c ) . 
  it 's usually `` fan . '', 
  it 's okay , let it out !, 
  and you forgot `` fascists . '', 
   other eu members do n't give much of a fuck about russia have you spoken with your neighbours to the north-east ? 
  well , it 's not good for any country to have a huge group of unregistered people flowing in uncontrolled . 
  few people or governments would say that 's okay . 
  ( this current situation is n't what merkel wanted . ), 
  i do n't know why people would criticize the us for not wanting that . 
  probably depends on where , but i 've spent a few months there ( mostly lviv , but also farther south ) in the last year and speak mostly russian . 
  no one complains or gives me a dirty looks . 
  no problems . 
  and they do n't always notice my accent immediately , so they sometimes think i 'm russian for a minute or so . 
  still no problems . 
  they really do n't hate each other . 
  of course , i never * insist * someone speak russian to me and always tried to understand first in ukrainian . 
  now i can speak better , too , but when i first went , i could n't speak any ukrainian . 
  [ republic of georgia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/georgia_%28country%29 ) :-), 
  yes , that 's the thing , she could have learned some english while gathering her ( fake ) documents for the visa , but she did n't , so it really seemed she just was n't thinking things through . 
  western ukraine seems to be fine with us , too . 
  the embassy rejected her visa application , so she stayed home . 
  you 'll eat them fried and you 'll * like * them !, 
  exactly what i was thinking . 
  it 's hard to tell if it looks `` bad '' to others because it used to be worse . 
  perhaps you should have a cup of tea and a nice lie down , dear . 
  ok , fair point . 
  yes , i think most work , whether legally or not . 
  i just do n't think poland deserves criticism for not wanting more refugees . 
   there are now 300,000-400 ,000 ukrainians in poland this especially bothers me . 
  poland 's received no help managing them * and then * they get insulted for not want to take more refugees . 
  ridiculous . 
   seek to form a smaller union with the eastern block .
