  i made the mistake of starting this medals-per-capita thing with a danish friend of mine . 
  in the beginning he said he did n't care because he was n't interested in the olympics . 
  and now he wo n't stop gloating ... 
  this is just personal experience , but i 've traveled between suceava-cluj-biharkeresztes ( hungarian border crossing ) quite a few times and have always bought the tickets a few days ahead , but never at a specific time of day . 
  just walked into the station and bought it . 
  i did buy the day before once or twice , and it was fine . 
  more popular routes via bucharest might be more crowded , though . 
  and i 'm * fairly certain * you have to pay for the ticket and reservation separately , but you buy them at the same time . 
  romanian railways has a website : http://www.cfrcalatori.ro/ i could n't find english there , but the old site has it : http://old.cfrcalatori.ro/ they have an online booking/purchase system , but i have n't tried that . 
  anyway , the trains are a bit old ( with compartments , not individual chairs ) and get quite hot in summer , but people ( at least where i 've been ) are very friendly and helpful if you ca n't find your seat or something . 
  as silly as that comment was , i thought they might have been suggesting that women have lower rates of combat ptsd than men . 
  however apparently not even that is true . 
  here 's [ some data analysis ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3494556/ ) that found women have * twice * the rate of ptsd as men regardless of trauma type ( assault , rape , etc. ) . 
  so yeah , probably trolling . 
  cockroach is sv\u00e1bbog\u00e1r ( schwabian bug ) in hungarian , too . 
  i always thought it was because one type of cockroach is the [ german cockroach or blattella germanica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_cockroach ) , so the name is referring to that , not anything to do with german people . 
  i was hoping for a mention of [ football in slippers ] ( http://www.mmreiska.fi/fi/in+english.html ) , but those are n't bad , either . 
  nah , they usually get it wrong and say beethoven . 
  and nietzsche was polish . 
  the very first time i visited , the passport inspector asked the usual `` business or tourism ? '', 
  and i said tourism . 
  she also asked how much cash i had ( 50 $ ) and if i had any medication ( yes , ibuprofen ) . 
  no problem with that . 
  after that i met people , then was going to visit friends , but no one has asked anything since . 
  not even the questions i got the first time . 
  agree . 
  for what it 's worth , i 've entered at both the chop ( hungarian ) border and siret ( romanian , near-ish suceava ) and have n't had problems even when the political problems in ukraine were quite bad ( i ca n't remember if i was there during actual wartime ) and speaking rather fluent russian . 
  i actually * expected * questioning , but no . 
  now i hope i do n't jinx myself by writing this ... 
  people against this ( against skinny , half-naked models , i mean ) are talking about [ model thin ] ( http://www.allmyfriendsaremodels.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-21-at-12.37.04-pm-e1411490658835.png ) and not [ healthy and fit ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/69/88/2d/69882d721fd70521bfded766b47d67b6.jpg ) . 
  fit people have muscle , and not much bone showing . 
  if models looked fit , few people would complain . 
  the premise sounds similar to aesop 's [ the farmer and the viper ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_farmer_and_the_viper ) fable , except it 's about judging on past behavior , rather than predicted behavior as with the snake . 
  some people seem to think gayness is contagious . 
  like seeing openly gay people will `` turn '' straight people into gay . 
  then everyone will be gay !, 
  i 've heard that here , although not often . 
  or they 're religious and think it 's a sin . 
  `` fatally shot '' would work . 
  anyway , that kid will have some story to tell about how he got the scar on his cheek . 
  i just always assumed they were austrian because of the name . 
  they look like b\u00e9csi f\u00e1nk ( `` viennese donuts '' ) . 
  they should be filled with jam or cream . 
  i think they 're called krapfen in german , and maybe berliners in english . 
  hey , at least i brought a handball . 
  also , i 'm bringing a jar of meggybef\u0151tt . 
  actually , i think i just blocked it out of my mind . 
  but i 'll bring some zs\u00edros keny\u00e9r if you want ... 
  they would n't be fresh . 
  :-( l\u00e1ngos that 's been in a picnic basket for an hour would n't be crispy anymore and even the k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs would be cold . 
  that 's also why there 's no guly\u00e1s . 
  that 's what i meant by `` peppers . '', 
  do n't worry , i planned to bring all kinds . 
  probably need some tomatoes , too . 
   khachapuri well-made khachapuri is indescribably good . 
  i know , i was trying to describe it to someone last night , but there are no words . 
  t\u00e9liszal\u00e1mi , turista szal\u00e1mi , some ham , trappista cheese , k\u00f6r\u00f6z\u00f6tt / liptauer cheese , peppers , cucumbers , bread rolls , t\u00far\u00f3rudis ( chocolate-covered cottage cheese sticks ) , homemade mesesajt ( chocolate cheese ) just because , apple r\u00e9tes to one-up austria 's strudel , cherry soup , 15 different kinds of breaded , deep-fried vegetables and cheeses , and a handball and net . 
  and some p\u00e1linka . 
  thanks !, 
  i actually only thought to look it up recently . 
  edit : oh , hey , now my post looks irrelevant ... 
  in hungarian , the name for poland is lengyelorsz\u00e1g . 
  `` orsz\u00e1g '' is just `` land , '' and the `` lengyel '' part apparently comes from the old slavic word `` lendo '' meaning cleared or virgin land . 
  or so the internet tells me . 
  so , essentially the same thing as the `` pol ' '' part meaning field . 
  i do n't know if anyone else calls them by a similar name . 
  op appears to be austrian . 
  are you forgetting part of ukraine was part of the austrian empire ? 
  interesting . 
  thanks for the recommendation !, 
  sure , it makes sense , i just had n't really thought about how it would sound . 
   latin based with some words from arabic . 
  wow , it does sound that way . 
  i just went to listen and it reminds me of ladino ( jewish-spanish ) . 
  -- and so that i answer the question , these [ hay stacks ] ( http://www.arc2020.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/romania-countryside-21.jpg ) seem rather unique . 
  i have n't seen them anywhere else , except a little in southern ukraine . 
  actually , the countryside is interesting because they use a lot traditional agricultural methods . 
  oh and the mountains in the east are gorgeous : [ rodna national park ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rodna_national_park ) . 
  can confirm . 
  like poland ; no comment on romania . 
  well he has been writing for a long time . 
  but even if you do n't understand the lyrics , i think it 's still good driving or staring-out-the-window music . 
  if you understand , though , some of it 's a bit too sad to be `` easy listening . '', 
  who would you recommend ? 
  maybe shushan petrosyan ? 
  sounds bloody . 
  thanks for the explanation !, 
  i did n't know that !, 
  i have n't seen that movie/serial/whatever it is . 
  apparently not everyone has heard [ l\u00e4ht\u00f6valmiina ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiettysh_fk ) , although if you have their albums i suppose you have . 
  * just making sure . 
  more or less alphabetically ... [ apulanta ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/apulantaofficial ) - finnish pop , their older stuff is more ... metally . 
  [ arthur meschian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/meschian ) - armenian , ballad type stuff . 
  [ finsterforst ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucsdffgw3cvzopuiczhu0nxw ) - german folk metal . 
  people i 've introduced them to seem to like them . 
  [ haloo helsinki ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucgoaiivxjuy8tjfb7ylqydw ) - three guesses , pop [ havukruunu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/uc1uvuarehh7laa2bmv2qbnq ) - finnish black metal . 
  quite mild as black metal goes . 
  [ nautilus pompilius ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucjaa2ootelnkdlmrf54khea ) - russian pop/rock [ okean elzy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/okeanelzyofficial ) - ukrainian pop , great lyrics [ svartsot ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/uck86ssu7-ihtcu1m4drgv5q ) - danish folk metal [ wardruna ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucwdqsta3kdu-rymj7x2rlbg/videos ) - norwegian band singing in old norse , modern folksy-pagany stuff . 
  that really does make sense . 
  i suppose it 's not * bad * just low relative to the `` popular '' countries .
