  i * just * had this discussion we something . 
  we agree . 
  thank you !, 
  when you have only a high-school education , no other job training , and know * only * georgian ? 
  ( i spoke with her via a russian-speaking friend because she did n't even know russian . ), 
  i think she was just really unrealistic . 
  i think she kind of knew , but thought she was just especially smart or lucky and could do better than most people . 
  more her personality than ignorance . 
  it 's possible . 
  i knew a young georgian woman was trying ( through fraud ) to get a us visa because she thought she would immediately find a job for the `` average '' salary of 40 thousand usd/year . 
  we tried to tell her the us also has many unemployed and those who earn less than average and * unlike her * , those people have citizenship , more than high school education , and know a language other than georgian ( eg . 
  english ! ) . 
  but she seemed to think she could n't fail . 
   lost in a knossos-type labyrinth this is the real reason . 
  their prices here are definitely not cheaper than a lot of working-class restaurants . 
  but that does n't explain the food section !, 
  it 's relative , i suppose . 
  there are certainly problems , but a lot of nearby countries have it even harder ( eg . 
  ukraine , romania ) . 
  i think a lot of them really do have high expectations , thinking they 're going live like the middle class in germany or wherever . 
  there are people here from richer countries , including germany and sweden , and they seem happy enough . 
  also , just like slovenia , hungary is a hellhole of fascism , barren moodscapes , and potatoes for dinner every day . 
  :-p / s, 
  well , also you ca n't let a huge mass of unidentified people walk through the country with no control . 
  they were trampling crops , leaving trash , blocking roadways and overcrowding railways so much they became unusable . 
  people would have blamed orb\u00e1n for allowing it . 
  maybe creating a `` safe corridor '' for them would have been possible , but that would use a lot of resources , too . 
  and austria probably would have our heads for letting the migrants walk over to them . 
  swedish food is good !, 
  if it were bad , ikeas would n't have successful food sections and restaurants . 
  just from what i see , people are grateful it 's there . 
  for one thing , the migrants coming through were trampling crops and stripping gardens that locals need for food . 
  but do n't give up on your own country , please . 
  we ca n't drink * only * \u017bubr\u00f3wka . 
  \u0141 in not just a w. . . or is it ? 
  do n't worry , [ we `` ll save you ] ( http://kajakkenusport.hu/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/nadas_bence_ifi_u23_vb_2014_1000-1000x485.jpg ) !, 
  need any new walls , while we 're at it ? 
  speaking of denmark ( u/3422g 's post ) , they did something similar by taking out [ adverts in lebanese papers ] ( http://www.thelocal.dk/20150907/denmarks-anti-refugee-ads-published-in-foreign-papers ) . 
  not as flashy , but probably more effective . 
  i highly doubt any migrant will see that video . 
  honestly , it 's probably more to ally local fears , which is fine . 
  will you accept some kayaks or canoes ? 
   is just insane i can agree with that . 
  did they background check the degrees ? 
  i do n't know about syria , but i know some places have a problem with fake degrees . 
  [ for example ] ( http://www.arabnews.com/news/718806 ), 
  i do n't think many would argue against people willing to follow the laws and customs . 
  just when you have so many coming , it 's hard to sort out who 's who . 
  but google-ing tells me poland has 120,000 active and 515,000 reserve . 
  wow . 
  that 's bad . 
  :-( kind of not surprised , though . 
  i see your point . 
  just hate to see anyone get hurt , including german police . 
   rage riots , it 's going to be when someone gets to germany well , i can certainly agree with this . 
  i suppose i 'm just thinking all it takes is one crazy guy to think , `` hey , there 's a bottle ... '', 
  no kidding . 
  if this keeps up , we * will * be having kickstarters/gofundmes just like ukraine did . 
  they were quite successful . 
  they have peace now , maybe they 'll have time to advise us ... 
  but if one can get through they fence , they can throw it at a cop . 
  or try to throw it over the fence . 
  not saying it 's the most logical tactic , but it would be so easy , i would n't be surprised if someone tried . 
  in any case , i hope you do n't have the same problem at your border . 
  ( serious , not sarcasm . ), 
  i 've been predicting someone will throw a molotov . 
  they 're not at all difficult to make . 
  precisely . 
  i do n't know how this * is n't * an invasion . 
  i 'm glad they 're sending military , but even so . 
  somehow we 'll end up being the bad guys in the media . 
  so ... somehow i missed a nearly 500 m bridge ? 
  if i can do it sober , then ed 's friend can do it drunk . 
  well , * i * did n't notice and i was looking for the border . 
  but it was dark out , so that 's my excuse . 
  anyway , ed 's friend would notice the difference between england and say , france , much faster . 
   french fries are from belgium . 
  i think that 's his point . 
  not feasible at the moment , but do it between austria and germany and they wo n't notice until they get off the bus . 
  otherwise , you notice when the language on the billboards change ( assuming you wake up ) . 
  i 'd offer hugs , but i do n't want to make you feel even more confined ... 
  perfectly safe . 
  you 'll be fine . 
  the vast majority of the city is the same as always and even where there might be `` trouble spots '' there are also police . 
  i live here and i 'm a woman , too , fwiw . 
  the german woman who [ lives without money ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2161966/woman-lives-money-16-years-wealthy-family-lost-she-happier.html ) might have outdone him , though . 
  did you notice the finn upthread telling almost the same joke about finns ? 
  too cute . 
  well , i do n't think i , alone , am allowed to personally invite the whole region , but i doubt anyone would complain ... 
  `` economy '' is relative , i suppose . 
  but you know , i talked with a friend in graz last night who was also complaining about the economy , so i should know . 
  okay , we 'll take in your bavarian refugees then . 
  any time , but do n't try the train . 
  you might want to stop in austria , though . 
  they have a real economy !, 
  i 'll adopt one !, 
  but i ca n't understand the german sense of humor , sorry , i 've tried . 
  we know very well , unfortunately . 
  i thought debianjunkie 's video was going to link to the [ 2006 protests ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekek9x6jmxu ) . 
  those were unarmed * citizens * .
