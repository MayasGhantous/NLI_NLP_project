  oh , i did n't know that . 
  thanks !, 
  i thought it was kind of a strange question . 
  to clarify the hungarian one , the question seems to be why is hungary called ugorschina in ukrainian , as opposed to vengria in russian . 
  well , i found `` k\u00f6pa sprit ungern '' ( buy alcohol hungary ) and `` ungersk \u00f6l '' ( hungarian beer ) suggested , so it seems we have * some * reputation . 
  other results were related to food . 
  it might be just being any appearance that is n't clearly turkish * plus * the neighborhood/location . 
  not full-on sexual assault like that , but guys getting aggressive is common in some areas . 
  i 'm mostly white , often mistaken for russian , and got asked for sex by random guys on the street , had some try to grope me and what not . 
  * but * that was far more common in `` bad neighborhoods '' ( eg . 
  aksaray , rather than \u00dcsk\u00fcdar . 
  never had problems in \u00dcsk\u00fcdar ) . 
  but i also met a georgian girl who said she had the same problems and believed it was because she looked like an arab . 
  i did n't know that . 
  that kind of settles it . 
  i always thought the excessive amount of mozart-themed tourist stuff in vienna seemed a bit like overcompensation . 
  but it sells , i suppose . 
  yes , it 's mozart , who was born in salzburg , which was ... [ just the archbishopric of salzburg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mozart's_nationality ) at the time , but of course , is now part of austria . 
  that 's why there 's a debate over his nationality . 
  beethoven was born in bonn , which was never part of the austrian empire . 
  do n't be sad , even if we only have one , it 's one more than masque up there . 
  surprised that comment was n't deleted . 
  it 's plainly bigoted and adds nothing . 
  i feel like there 's [ more you could do ] ( http://imgur.com/nmb5tjn ) . 
  one mop breed is n't enough for you ? 
  :-p but you 're right , they definitely should have been in there . 
  thanks for the addition . 
  :-) [ komondor puppies ] ( http://edogshow.eu/sites/default/files/pic/454/litter/1973kom.jpg ) nursing a mop for extra cuteness . 
  all three !, 
  the west is called california , the east is called new york and everything in the middle is called texas . 
  simple . 
  i was thinking it sounds like a supermarket . 
  according to the [ small animal vet ] ( http://www.kisallatorvos.hu/aktualis/melyik_a_legnepszerubb_kutyafajta_magyarorszagon ) site ( which got their data from hvg magazine ) , the top five are : german shepherd , french bulldog , english bulldog , yorkshire terrier , and the short-haired [ hungarian vizsla ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vizsla ) . 
  i feel like i 've been seeing more and more [ puli ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/puli ) dogs around budapest over the last five or so years , although they 're not really city dogs . 
  they 're herding dogs and need a lot of space to run around . 
  [ puli puppies ] ( http://w3.enternet.hu/cserisub/kolyokimages/l1000509-web.jpg ) provided for cuteness reasons . 
  lithuania , actually . 
  but of those two ... eesti . 
  no offense . 
  yeah , the rental market is a bit crazy right now . 
  i came back to budapest from a few months abroad in july last year , expecting to find a place within a week like i always had . 
  i was n't able to , and finally just called all my friends in a panic , and found something affordable that way . 
  and one of them also said she knew people having trouble finding a flat . 
  if you can manage in hungarian , [ this site ] ( http://www.jofogas.hu/magyarorszag/ingatlan ) will help you get an idea . 
  same here . 
  i do n't find romania ( specifically suceava and cluj ) cheap . 
  i felt about the same as u/old _ faraon -- seems like should be around 10 % cheaper , but is actually a little more expensive . 
  but taxis are cheap . 
  i used to have an internet friend in romania . 
  once he was complaining that he found groceries expensive compared to his salary , but he and i earned about the same . 
  i asked how that was possible and he assured me groceries in hungary are cheaper ( he had been to hungary recently , not sure where ) . 
  but that was around 6 years ago ... 
   over what threshold , i do n't have to apply for a visa is n't it based on how many people end up staying illegally ? 
  so if thousands of french citizens go to the us , take up jobs and stay past their 90 visa-free days , and they get caught , france could end up on the `` the list . '', 
  ( kwuhbeker . ), 
  better ? 
  well , three of us over here never bothered to have separate `` he '' and `` she '' in the first place . 
  five if you add georgia and armenia , and six if you count turkey . 
  wait , is this supposed to be nor * ilsk * ? 
  and `` in winter '' -- where 's the snow ? 
  * something 's not right here . 
   you are 49 % russian !, 
  it may be that you 've been in emigration for too long . 
  time to watch some old victory day parades on video and remember your roots . 
  thanks a lot , * mom * !, 
  fortunately , though , i 'm fairly certain choosing kyiv as the capital saved me breaking 50 % . 
  i think [ this ] ( https://vimeo.com/21737695 ) * is what happened . 
  anyway , now russia is going to solve all our problems !, 
  dear moscow , we 're still waiting for help repairing the fence . 
  \\* lyrics in part say `` i left for st. petersburg , but came ( arrived ) to leningrad . '', 
  i 'm sure op meant `` depreciation . '', 
  strong leader becomes less valuable with every year . 
  edit : oh , i see someone already made that joke , but the point stands ... 
   and is in fact called palestine . 
  `` yes , yes , palestine . 
  are there any flights to tel aviv , palestine departing from kortrijk-wevelgem international airport because i would prefer to depart from the greater netherlands , rather than belgium . '', 
  or they could just send them to [ our soviet theme park ] ( http://www.mementopark.hu/ ) in budapest . 
  on the other hand , i understand why they want them destroyed . 
  well , as a girl , i have an interest in not being annoyed , so that 's why i prefer watering in july . 
  i think we just do it at the wrong time of year . 
  armenia also has a throw-water-on-girls day ( [ vardavar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vardavar ) ) , but it 's in july when it 's so hot you appreciate the water . 
  at one point i had two full buckets poured on me ( from a hotel balcony ! ), 
  and did n't really mind . 
   match the number of trees taken down with new ones planted . 
  that might help with oxygen , but it 's not a real alternative because this is old growth forest . 
  i agree with u/trailbear that loss of biodiversity is the bigger problem here . 
  well , hey , at least we do n't hunt down apostates and use violence . 
  we just guilt trip them and/or assure them it 's `` just a phase '' they 'll get over . 
  i do n't blame you for being confused . 
  i had to look it up to be sure . 
   i believe , halachically , if you convert to a different religion , that is the only way for a jew to stop being jewish . 
  nope , [ still jewish ] ( http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1269075/jewish/is-a-jew-who-converts-still-jewish.htm ) . 
  halachically speaking , anyway . 
  oh , i thought maybe you were abroad and did n't have an \u00f3 on your keyboard . 
  i only mentioned it because j\u00f3 sounds like joo , whereas jo does n't . 
   hungarian jo ( meaning good ) j\u00f3 . 
  are you missing a key ? 
  well , we have to keep your dangerous [ drunken cops ] ( http://www.haaretz.com/world-news/1.676641 ) out somehow . 
  and i wonder how many people even realize it . 
  i was talking with a ukrainian friend about their agriculture , and i said something about the radioactivity problem .
