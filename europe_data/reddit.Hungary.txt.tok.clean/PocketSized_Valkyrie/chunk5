  he seemed a bit offended and said that was n't true . 
  i was surprised because the guy is a medical doctor . 
  so i pointed out that researchers have found radioactivity even farther away ( eg . 
  [ germany ] ( http://www.iflscience.com/environment/wild-boar-roaming-forests-germany-are-too-radioactive-eat ) and [ norway ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2016/03/norways-radioactive-reindeer/471705/ ) ) . 
  i think he believed me , but i was surprised he could think there was no remaining contamination . 
  t\u00f6bb is veszett moh\u00e1csn\u00e1l -- more was lost at [ the battle of ] moh\u00e1cs . 
  whatever bad thing just happened is n't so bad compared to the losses at moh\u00e1cs . 
  it 's for the same times you 'd say `` do n't cry over spilled milk . '', 
  i assume not a lot of other countries have sayings about moh\u00e1cs , though . 
  but you know that idea 's been around for a while , right ? 
  for example : ` when israel was experiencing an epidemic of violent rapes and someone at a cabinet meeting suggested women be put under curfew until the rapists were caught , [ then prime minister golda ] meir shot back , `` men are committing the rapes . 
  let them be put under curfew . '' ' [ source ] ( http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/meir-golda ) neither solution is practical , of course , but she got the point across . 
  szp\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1j !, 
  eksuali , `` d\u00f6 '' d\u00e1z szaund beter ... 
  wow , that 's actually understandable . 
  you * sure * they were syrians ? 
  syrian and most levantine muslim women stick with the headscarf and loose/modest clothing . 
  maybe they were saudi . 
  depends on if skyr3 was living reasonably well or struggling to pay for groceries . 
  a lot of people just go somewhere , work to save up money , and return home . 
  and then some personality types always chase `` bigger , better . '', 
  interesting he says 2 mil . 
  a year would `` totally overwhelm '' the resources of the us , yet germany 's expected to handle even more per sq. 
  of course . 
  the more widely spoken the language , the more resources . 
  that 's understandable . 
  as someone wrote earlier , though , the situation is improving . 
  yes , sounds like a general carry-over effect from those times . 
   focusing on poland , ukraine , romania , serbia and montenegro , the researchers compared the views of people and businesses living in communities on ** both sides of the empire 's borders ** . 
  okay , * that * makes sense . 
  so , western ukraine and romania are more trusting than the eastern parts , for example . 
  i agree there 's a lack of resources in hungarian . 
  maybe i overestimate what 's available . 
  yes , in another comment , i added that i realize not everyone does well with unstructured learning . 
  i do n't consider it a moral failing at all !, 
  it 's learning style . 
  maybe my `` seriously ? '', 
  was a little too harsh ... also i think `` i 'm not motivated because i see no benefits '' is a perfectly acceptable reason . 
  hey , i was just trying to interpret low 's comment . 
  but can you find vocabulary lists , dictionaries , reading material , music , movies , forums , people to talk with over skype , etc. ? 
  i was thinking of that rather than courses . 
  that said , i know every one 's different and some people do n't do well with unstructured learning . 
  but i still think a lot of the `` too expensive '' people could benefit from internet learning ... if they knew about it . 
  as a side note , dutch might * not * be easy because the words are so similar to german it 's easy to confuse them . 
  oh , that 's great . 
  :-) good luck to her . 
  i agree courses are too expensive for a lot of people . 
  i was thinking of free resources . 
  but if you live in a village , those are harder to find . 
  i wonder what age group they asked ... 
  at least it 's honest !, 
  yeah , maybe i overestimate the average person 's internet skills . 
  that 's a pity people are left out , though , because it 's such a valuable resource . 
  `` it 's too expensive ? '', 
  seriously ? 
  if you can afford internet , you can afford to learn . 
  `` i do n't see any possible benefits '' should have been a choice , too . 
  if you already speak , say , reasonable english and german , it 's better to improve those than to start french or something . 
  if he meant in that sense , sure . 
  however , i presume low did not take it that way , which is why he/she commented . 
  because based on that snippet , it does sound like he meant literal writing . 
  i think low was referring to the whole `` defacing public property '' thing , although i doubt that was the reason for the refusal , it shows a lack of respect for the places he visited , suggesting he could have also done something even worse at some point . 
  yes , i saw someone posted an article about that , but i did n't read it . 
  it seems like it could n't be worse than no trees at all , though . 
  thanks !, 
  i was n't thinking so far back , i suppose . 
  probably everyone had more trees back then . 
  also seems i overestimated how much is `` treeless . '', 
  oh , hey , thanks for that . 
  that 's good news . 
  it 's not so bad considering that a large part of the country is naturally treeless plains , so it 's not like it 's from deforestation or poor land management . 
  ( at least , i presume . 
  i could be wrong . ), 
  also , if you look at photos of budapest from 100 years or so ago , there seem to be a lot more trees now . 
  [ gell\u00e9rt hill before ] ( http://www.szeretlekmagyarorszag.hu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/asp_620_erzshid.jpg ) and [ gell\u00e9rt hill now ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fewwbae-k6i/uldawncchli/aaaaaaaaam0/8h3kw1sx0oo/s1600/dscf0162.jpg ) . 
  ( bridge is looking better , too ... ), 
   flash in photography we have `` vaku '' for that . 
  there are probably more along these lines , but ... i 'm half asleep now . 
  but it 's very interesting . 
  hungarian also has vill\u00e1m , meaning lightning ( like , electricity in the sky ) and villany , meaning light ( like , from a light bulb ) just to add a few . 
  to add to this , in budapest , really anywhere there are tourists , although that goes for any city . 
  i 've heard there are pickpockets on the tram 4-6 line , but never experienced any . 
  that said , last summer , i saw some guy try to * pull * a necklace off a woman near the central market hall ( so , basically v\u00e1ci ) . 
  that 's very rare , but it may be best to avoid wearing anything flashy . 
  that makes sense . 
  it also * looks * like there are some pink dots , possibly representing swedish ... or slovenians , who knows . 
  we were just noticing estonian is n't even in the list . 
  i do n't see it . 
  to me tallinn appears to be the same color as helsinki , but it 's hard to tell . 
  ukrainian is n't there , either . 
  or basque , armenian , georgian ... maybe these are the top 30-ish most common languages on twitter and the others were n't popular enough . 
  first of all , each group is responsible for their own . 
  you ca n't expect jews to make memorials for russian pows or russians to make memorials for gypsies , etc. 
  second of all , gypsies do have memorials . 
  certainly in hungary and there 's even this one [ in berlin ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-20050780 ) . 
  there 's the [ homomonument ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homomonument ) yes , it 's terrible people of various groups died , but if people from those groups feel underrepresented , then they 're the ones who should be writing books , making films , etc. 
  instead of complaining that they 're underrepresented . 
   it 's all ~ ~ the same ~ ~ going to be poland anyway ... 
   greater poland : the baltics , hungary , the czech republic , slovenia and western ukraine . 
  so ... slovakia gets broken up and absorbed into other countries ?
