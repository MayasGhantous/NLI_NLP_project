  if we have the baltics , can we include finland , too ? 
  would be a pity to leave them behind . 
  well , sure , they 're not exactly best friends . 
  to be fair , armenia is really small and * any * base would be `` near the turkish border . '', 
  their other base is in gyumri , which is * right next to * the turkish border . 
  thank you for telling me !, 
  i 've corrected it . 
  i clicked the spellcheck list without checking first ... 
  okay , apparently my other comment was removed . 
  ( i did n't know the dailymail was n't allowed here ) . 
  i just wanted to add that [ her brother was interviewed ] ( http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/kitty-genoveses-brother-reexamines-her-famous-murder ) and explained that her cries were not ignored and a friend came to help her . 
  i think you 're a little biased ... 
  apparently it is rather original , though . 
  `` the color on the flag is sometimes referred to as latvian red . 
  the red colour of the latvian flag is a particularly dark shade , which is composed of brown and purple . '', 
  [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_latvia ), 
  i was thinking of [ this ] ( http://citykey.net/images/product/295/469295/konservy-riga-file-lososya-naturalnoe.jpg ) , which is owned by a [ latvian company ] ( http://kaija.lv/en/about/ ) . 
  i assume the salmon was coming from the baltic sea . 
  and i 've heard people ( russians ) say good things about latvian salmon . 
  so ... all i know about it . 
  well , the red color in their flag is particularly nice , how about that ? 
  ca n't we all * just get along * !? 
  :-p well , maybe that article was a bad example . 
  it did say `` 12 things you did n't know '' rather than `` 12 completely unique things '', 
  poor latvia . 
  they do seem a bit left out . 
  i found this [ 12 things about lativa ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/trvca ) article to help . 
  it * does * contain an exploding potato , just to warn you . 
  i was also going to say latvia . 
  i know * a bit * more about lithuania and estonia . 
  all i know about latvia is they 're famous for salmon . 
  he went right for the throat !, 
  well , that 's a plan . 
  if * everyone * on all sides runs away from fighting , there will * be * no war . 
  failing that , i hope i would stay and defend my country . 
  otherwise , georgian caucasus . 
  i have an ex-boyfriend whose parents ' house is nearly inaccessible . 
  true , true . 
  i just meant `` the thing one does n't ask about . '', 
  yes , thank you for that . 
  i was n't complaining , just noticing . 
  i opened this thread thinking `` yes , poland ! '', 
  then read the post to see op had already mentioned that ... 
  you 're thinking of greenland . 
  do n't ask too many questions about greenland ... 
  a quick google search will probably tell you more than this sub . 
  or r/norway anyway , there 's . no version of happypancake , but i 'm fairly certain they only accept profiles in the local ( whichever country version you choose ) language ... * good luuuuck *, 
  and [ baranta ] ( http://www.usadojo.com/styles/about-baranta.htm ) . 
  and i think we can count [ krav maga ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/krav_maga ) because it was founded by a hungarian . 
  well , that 's almost as nice as `` dishwater blond '' in english . 
  it 's a pity the categories are n't more refined . 
  just from what i 've seen lviv has are * a lot * more blondes than budapest . 
  ( looking mostly at men who usually do n't use dye . ), 
  but they 're in the same category here . 
  for that matter , so does the warsaw airport . 
  even someone from lviv told me when he visited hungary , he was surprised how dark people are . 
  i like that russian has a word for that between-blond-and-brown color : [ \u0420\u0443\u0441\u044b\u0439 / rusyy ] ( https://www.google.hu/search?q=%d1%80%d1%83%d1%81%d1%8b%d0%b5+%d0%b2%d0%be%d0%bb%d0%be%d1%81%d1%8b&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=609&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahukewj2tpqjvpdkahxcipokharaacqq_auibigb ) . 
  as opposed to [ true blond ] ( https://www.google.hu/search?q=%d1%80%d1%83%d1%81%d1%8b%d0%b5+%d0%b2%d0%be%d0%bb%d0%be%d1%81%d1%8b&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=609&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahukewj2tpqjvpdkahxcipokharaacqq_auibigb#tbm=isch&amp;q=%d0%b1%d0%bb%d0%be%d0%bd%d0%b4+%d1%86%d0%b2%d0%b5%d1%82+%d0%b2%d0%be%d0%bb%d0%be%d1%81 ) . 
  i thought we were going for the most famous . 
  thank you !, 
  they are n't truly classical era , but [ zolt\u00e1n kod\u00e1ly ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zolt%c3%a1n_kod%c3%a1ly ) , who developed one of the world 's most important violin instruction methods , [ ferenc liszt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franz_liszt ) and [ b\u00e9la b\u00e1rtok ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/b%c3%a9la_bart%c3%b3k ) are probably the best known . 
  yeah , it kind of looks like it 's trying to say `` this way to the etho-cultural museum . '', 
  sounds very accurate to me . 
  istanbul is a megacity like new york and is very diverse . 
  i 've even heard native istanbul turks say foreigners are good because they 're what make the city as strong as it is . 
  i lived there for a total of about two years and never had a problem . 
  switzerland , on the other hand , is quite small and does n't really have the space to host a microcosm . 
  i am surprised athens is so happy , though . 
  oh , it * was * weird . 
  it was an internet marketing job . 
  i would understand wanting someone who * speaks * german or understands german buying habits , etc. 
  but going * only * by ethnicity is weird . 
   the guy must live in the 1940s ... well then , the joke 's on him because my last name is actually yiddish , although is also a german word . 
   germans will always be welcomed in hungary someone ( in budapest ) once offered me a job because he believed ethnic germans are `` better workers '' than ethnic hungarians . 
  i did n't accept because 1 ) low pay and 2 ) do n't want to work for a bigot , but anyway , that attitude is out there . 
  also , single and childless here , just sayin ' !, 
  interesting . 
  this is probably all in my head , but i feel `` woods '' can mean old-growth , too , but it 's thinner and with leaf trees , rather than evergreens . 
  a `` real forest '' you ca n't see very far into . 
  although pine forests are an exception . 
  i 'd never think to call a cultivated forest anything but `` fake woods . '', 
  interesting . 
  thanks !, 
  well , fine then , be french . 
  :-p but does n't `` forest '' and `` woods '' make you think of somewhat different things ? 
  because i picture [ forest ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-q90lpr8h_5u/tqynmzphmji/aaaaaaaakrm/lpwrvf8wsnw/s1600/img_8045.jpg ) versus [ woods ] ( http://thats-livin.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/lush-woods.jpg ) . 
  but it 's a word , right ? 
  presumably it was picked up from french or another language and just never became popular * because * it was of foreign origin . 
  that 's just my guess , though . 
  also [ finsterforst ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwvtteobsc ) uses it , but maybe folk metal bands are n't the best source ... 
  yes , i was just thinking the map kind of misses some connections . 
  i think the map should use `` woods '' for england because that 's the germanic . 
  apparently `` forest '' is [ from latin ] ( http://www.worldwidewords.org/articles/forest.htm ) . 
  but how is it defined ? 
  because english has the word `` woods '' similar to `` wald '' and german has `` forst '' similar to `` forest . '', 
  as [ evidenced ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34546723 ) in autumn , although they did n't meant to kill him . 
   one country hey , hey . 
  fence . 
  although in this case they may do well to do the same thing and help those who get through to continue moving west . 
  awww , bless istanbul and their love for cats .
