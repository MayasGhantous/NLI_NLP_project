  that and possibly to discourage people from wanting emigrate from russia by showing `` the west '' as a degenerate and dangerous place . 
  that is a good explanation . 
  i tried to say something like that ( although not so eloquently ) months ago and only ended up with someone understanding it as `` oh , so you did n't mind being treated as a dog . '', 
  lol , no . 
  he really was n't a weirdo , just forgot what 14 ( usually ) looks like . 
   we remember the time when we were around 14 as well . 
  exactly . 
  he left home at 14 ( father kicked him out ) and remembers his 14-year-old self as an `` adult '' because he had to do everything himself and grow up fast . 
  but , yes , i agree 18 and 12 is just weird . 
  my former husband once said 14 was a perfectly reasonable age of consent and it should be okay for an adult to sleep with a 14-year-old . 
  but i * knew * he had no clear idea how a 14-year-old girl looks and acts . 
  so i said , `` you know , [ girl we know ] is 14 '' and he immediately looked horrified and said `` oh no way , that 's a child . 
  never mind ! '', 
  that 's what i was thinking . 
  maybe they wanted to focus on recreational drugs ( but then , they included amphetamines , so maybe not ) . 
  maybe they excluded it because it ca n't be separated from morphine used in hospitals ( after being metabolized ) . 
  although the amphetamines and at least some of the cannabis could be from medical use as well , so ... 
  yes , i see it as `` my country/nation/culture has good things about it . '', 
  every culture has * something * good about it that 's worth preserving and learning about . 
  and you get attached to your culture because you spend so much time with it , like you get attached to your family members or neighbors , etc. 
  even though you know they 're not inherently `` better people '' than others . 
  thanks !, 
  almost all the finnish i know comes from songs , so ... that explains my grammar . 
  i mistook ui for \u00faj ( new ) , but uusi looks like \u00faszik ( swim ) , so it balances out ... 
  which is ( or should be , pardon my very rough grammar ) something like : nainen menee y\u00f6ll\u00e4 j\u00e4\u00e4ll\u00e4 verinen nuolen kanssa . 
  but i do n't know if those are actually related or just seem that way . 
   we 're extraterrestrial beings well , that 's a new one . 
  and do n't forget [ jesus was hungarian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5ak_cypcow ) . 
  most people i know ( if asked ) would rather be associated with finns and distance themselves from turkic culture , actually . 
  hungarian * does * have a lot of turkic words , but also a lot of slavic . 
  frazeri explained it well . 
  maybe some people are just annoyed with people who * insist * we should be able to understand each other because they `` read in a book that ... '' ( i 'm referring to taxi drivers abroad . ), 
  i 'd feel safe walking in budapest alone at that hour ( if i had any reason to ) . 
  then again , i 've walked around istanbul at that hour and had no problems except from cops who assumed i was a prostitute . 
  just seems strange to oppose it when it 's 1 ) not harming anyone 2 ) not misinforming anyone ( assuming it is n't ) and 3 ) might actually save lives by discouraging people from crossing the aegean . 
   got a lot of shit for it . 
  did they really , though ? 
  i mean , i know about the satire ad from the dutch newspaper , but i thought that was teasing rather than actual criticism . 
  who thought the danish government was actually wrong/bad for putting out ads ? 
  this is getting dangerously close to banning chocolate , which could leave the [ world 's third-largest chocolate consumers ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2015/07/22/the-worlds-biggest-chocolate-consumers-infographic/#1c2856e212b8 ) rather irritable . 
   ( or is that cookie of color ? ), 
  it 's from the [ brownies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brownie_points ) , like the girl scouts . 
  that 's beautiful . 
  useful for erd\u0151\u0151r and , um ... el\u0151\u0151sz ... 
  thanks . 
  i know finnish has diphthongs but i did n't know about estonian . 
  but ... well , now * i 'm * confused . 
  it depends on how the estonian \u00f6\u00f6 is pronounced -- as two sounds or one ? 
  ( because i do n't actually know ... ) in hungarian , \u00f6\u00f6 is two \u00f6 pronounced separately . 
  there 's s break between them . 
  \u0151 is one \u00f6 held for the length of time of two \u00f6 . 
  i mostly just wanted to tease . 
  but yes , \u0151 is \u00f6 held a longer time ( [ examples ] ( http://www.hungarianreference.com/hungarian-alphabet-phonetic-pronunciation.aspx ) ) . 
  \u00f6\u00f6 and \u0151 and \u0151\u0151 would each sound different . 
  but \u00f6\u00f6-\u00f6\u00f6 still would n't be * hard * to pronounce . 
  i ca n't think of any time \u0151\u0151\u0151\u0151 would be necessary ... 
  so basically t\u0151-\u0151 ? 
  you know , you guys could save some ink ... 
  aww , thanks !, 
  that 's what i thought , too . 
  feel free to borrow our sea access ... since you actually know how to use it . 
  well , [ pray until it rains ] ( https://books.google.hu/books?id=6dxa33ukhzac&amp;pg=pa1&amp;lpg=pa1&amp;dq=inspired&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vnlm-eycpd&amp;sig=n5cae0zwtkhaxatis2zacqvx8ug&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjimfgqk7pkahwbjcwkhdf6bscq6aeinzad#v=onepage&amp;q=inspired&amp;f=false ) , i suppose . 
  i think the cultural part matters a lot , too , though . 
  and each country has different set of factors . 
  i presume it 's like with cystic fibrosis . 
  there are genes , but the irish and danes do n't necessarily have the * exact same * cf gene mutation . 
   and this is what we inherited well , and good looks and general aggressiveness . 
  genetics . 
  :-( [ this page ] ( http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/articles/05_00/suicide_gene.shtml ) is old , but talks about ( possibly ) why hungary and finland have relatedly-high suicide rates . 
  of course , there are also cultural reasons , but the genes are n't helping . 
  i 'm short on time to find more , but i 'm sure there 's newer research available . 
  rich people who complain about being poorer than the swiss . 
  :-p alps , coffee , raiffeisen bank , mild catholism . 
  falco !, 
  not really like germans in general , but similar to bavarians . 
  more conservative and traditional than `` average '' germans . 
  and better dressed . 
  and more sociable and chatty . 
  i 've noticed you/they tend to have rather strong personalities and do n't like to compromise . 
  i do n't mean that as an insult at all , just that can cause a clash of egos sometimes . 
  and ... `` vienna is like a beautiful woman who * knows * she 's beautiful . '', 
  -- my father, 
  might be more effective to dress [ like this ] ( http://s3.scoopwhoop.com/anj/womenincombat_8/120678446.jpg ) . 
  i saw your reply without your flair . 
  well , now i feel silly . 
  yeah , i thought i 'd never heard of that before . 
  interesting . 
  i did n't know that . 
  i spent new year 's eve with some friends last night and they explained how the `` new '' and `` old '' new years are celebrated differently because i did n't know that , either . 
  this year is the second that i spend christmases ( both of them ) in lviv and the 7th seems more popular . 
  of course , there are a lot of ethnic poles who are catholic and they do christmas on the 24th/25th . 
  shops and everything are open , and buses running as normal on that day ( `` catholic christmas '' ) , but closed jan. 1 and jan. 7 . 
  could have dec. 24 to jan 7 off , though ... just because . 
   gives some pr points i suppose if anyone is naive enough to think amazon actually cares . 
  doing it this way makes it rather obvious they 're only doing it either for `` image '' or to be spiteful . 
  or people who want to support refugees * will * buy the song because some of the proceeds go to refugee charities . 
  :-) but really , it seems petty from amazon . 
  they 're donating simply to annoy people . 
  it would be better to donate to some non-political charity , such as a wildlife rehabilitation center . 
  `` so simple even a child can use it .
