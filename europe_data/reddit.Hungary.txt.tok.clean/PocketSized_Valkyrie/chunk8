  and they do . '', 
  it was pretty much designed to be simple . 
  i like that it 's been allowed to live peace and no one has graffiti-ed it yet . 
  got a little bit of snow in lviv overnight . 
  it 's still here ( 1 pm now ) , even in the trees . 
  temperature currently -2 , bright and sunny . 
  ( also , congratulations to oulu ! ), 
  it 's getting a * little * colder here ( lviv ) , but no snow . 
  it 's like a rorschach test . 
  everyone sees something different in it . 
  you 're right , it 's more like a slime mold , which has similarities with amoeba . 
  if you cut an amoeba in half , and it ca n't grow back together and the side without the nucleus dies . 
  but if you cut up a slime mold , the parts can live separately for a while , but later they can grow back together again . 
  ( that 's a joke , btw . 
  sorry , could n't resist . ), 
   ( if you have a 1st degree in physics or a phd ) hmm . 
  :-( i have a friend who 's taught math and physics , and speaks excellent english , but he has an ma in philosophy and no teaching certificate . 
  with no certificate , it 's hard for him to get a good teaching job in hungary because the system is rather bureaucratic . 
  he can do other things , but he loves teaching and he 's quite good at it . 
  thanks !, 
  looked like an iron cross to me . 
  yeah , black and red looks nice in embroidery , but kind of have to be careful with it on flags . 
  the blue and yellow looks nice and friendly . 
  less aggressive than black and red ( i mean the other popular color set , not the armed forces set ) . 
  even so , is n't german the second most popular foreign language ? 
  [ this report ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/languages/policy/strategic-framework/documents/language-survey-final-report_en.pdf#page=10 ) seems to imply that , although it does n't list every european country . 
  at first , i thought `` what do oars have to do with ... ? '', 
  then i realized those are n't oars . 
  well , i suppose * just * the iron cross and trident would have looked too plain . 
  that 's because i 'm ~ ~ a portuguese spy ~ ~ very clever . 
  in that particular case , it sounds like more of a rhetorical threat to make a point , but of course , there are contexts in which it could get dangerous . 
  * hmm * what about born-again re-reconquista de novo ? 
  i 'm not a spanish-speaker so i 'm probably not the best a naming things in spanish ... 
   profit probably . 
  you 'll have a [ big demographic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reconquista_%28mexico%29 ) to sell to . 
  there 's also a little one in [ lviv ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85exrtykhps ) and a bigger one in [ moscow ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8mgcbq5urm ) . 
  of course , they call them `` new year 's trams . '', 
  honestly , i kind of suspect the idea came from moscow . 
  well , if you get too much , please send some south . 
   i bet we 'll get some snow next week . 
  i 've been telling myself this since mid-november . 
  interesting . 
  it makes sense the cultures would share some things because the countries are so close . 
  caroling seems to be a universal christian thing , too . 
   this alleged starman silly , obviously a starman is what [ star boy ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/3f/ee/50/3fee50981602660199096fab2e96e296.jpg ) grows up to be !, 
  ( [ more info ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_lucy's_day ) for the curious . ), 
  ( also , to be clear , i 'm joking . 
  no actual connection . ), 
  they have active problems [ with azerbaijan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian%e2%80%93azerbaijani_border_conflict#2011.e2.80.932015_continued_fighting ) . 
  not sure how much those soldiers will actually help , but it 's not illegal to be friendly with russia . 
  okay , that makes sense . 
  interesting . 
  yeah , we give surname-given name even in an informal context ( eg . 
  meeting someone new at a cocktail party ) . 
  he 's not making it up , either . 
  there 's a little metal box you put coins in to make the lift work . 
  i suppose it 's to collect for lift/building maintenance . 
  even in armenia , i did n't see them . 
  * exactly * the same , though ? 
  like , for example , you might go to an office building frontdesk and ask to see `` ionescu mihail '' instead of `` mihail ionescu '' ? 
  or even in a more casual setting ? 
  [ wiki says ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_name ) says `` some romanians occasionally introduce themselves with their family names first . '', 
  but that 's some and occasionally . 
  i 'm not trying to argue , i 've just never heard that before . 
  that 's rather intense . 
  we have some [ pastel versions ] ( https://www.google.hu/maps/@47.4251606,19.0692371,3a,75y,281.76h,142.95t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sfbd28iejltlhzafasza0mg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) , though . 
   they probably could given due compensation eh . 
  they would probably given a small sum and * told * it 's `` due compensation '' when it 's barely enough to by a house in a village somewhere . 
  something like that [ happened in yerevan ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/as_yerevan_gets_facelift_many_armenians_lose_their_homes/1968306.html ) . 
   no salt in the dough well , you know , salt is so expensive . 
  well , now i want to book a ticket ... 
   do n't give 100 kr for a hotdog do n't worry ... :-p, 
  i was happy enough with the aesthetics . 
  i liked it more than schiphol , actually . 
  just a matter of taste , i suppose . 
  impressive . 
  pizza 's not an easy food to ruin . 
  thanks for the warning !, 
  ] ( http://120.hp2.jp/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/20030903_copenhagen_airport.jpg ) it 's beautiful . 
  do n't know about the food ; have n't been in a while . 
  aaww , you 're just depressed and * think * they do n't like you . 
  but okay , hug latvia , then . 
  enjoy [ potato ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/226/770/1325375507001.png ) . 
   makes me even more depressed to know you did n't know ? 
  sorry to bring bad news . 
  :-( go ask eesti for a hug . 
  they seem to be your nearest non-suicidal neighbor . 
  but ... according to that list lithuania and russia are ahead of hungary , poland , and ukraine , and belarus is just below hungary . 
  or am i reading it wrong ? 
  anyway , i agree it 's very hard to pin down . 
  there are a lot of factors influencing this , including access to healthcare/medication , and society 's views on mental illness ( openness versus shame ) and suicide . 
  yeah , it 's weird . 
  i 'm in lviv and weather.com says it 's 7c as of 15:00 . 
  i was here last year and it was so nice and snowy . 
  i was hoping for the same again . 
   so welcome to the club oh , i 'm just temporarily over in ukraine , but their politics are distracting enough . 
   there is simply no clear line drawn true . 
   \u00c1kos is a moron for saying that i 'm out of the country and not up-to-date , but i 'm really sad to hear he said something like that . 
  i liked him . 
  yes , i knew he was conservative , but i did n't realize how far .
