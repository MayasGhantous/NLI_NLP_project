  edit : eh , his original quote does n't sound * that * bad . 
  not surprised , but still sad . 
  actually , i understand dt 's reaction more than the government 's . 
  it makes dt look bad to to their main customers -- it 's about pr and money . 
  i 'll take your word for it -- i 'm not fluent in surfer dude . 
  yes , that 's not far off . 
  and the `` a '' is a bit problematic , too , because it 's not like the `` a '' in `` father , '' but something between an `` a '' and `` o '' sound . 
  it seems foreigners can pronounce it after hearing it , but it 's hard to explain . 
  that one 's especially funny because it 's four languages in one . 
  now we have tea and meat with sauce for a nice little snack . 
  it 's more a soft d than a hard g ( like `` get '' ) or soft g ( like `` germany '' ) . 
  a fluent-russian-speaking friend of mine says it 's like the \u0434 in \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d , if you happen to speak russian . 
  but then , maybe he thinks that because of his hungarian accent ; i ca n't be sure . 
   saying hello and goodbye to shop owners there are places * is n't * normal ? 
  yes , it seems rude not to greet the shopkeeper unless they 're really busy/distracted . 
  i 've travelled a fair amount and it always * seemed * normal everywhere i 've been ( no shopkeeper seemed surprised to be greeted ) , although maybe they just thought i was a weird foreigner . 
   clapping when the airplane lands georgians do this !, 
  i 've never seen anyone else do it . 
  afaik , there were female tank drivers , pilots , and snipers in wwii , at least on the soviet side . 
  but that may have been because they lost so many men . 
  at a certain point , everyone who can fight will . 
  if a country has an on-going defence concern ( like sharing a border with russia ) then military training for all makes sense , * but * people are still going to end up with different jobs based on their skills and physical ability . 
  i suppose all i 'm really against is some law require a 50/50 male/female split in combat soldiers the name of equality to avoid hurting women 's feelings . 
  and i ca n't imagine anyone wanting that because it would weaken the military overall . 
  interesting . 
  glad it was accepted . 
  i 've no issue with equal * conscription ; * it 's equal * combat * roles that worry me . 
  if the women are n't equally effective fighters , it could be a problem . 
  it just seems like some people want to send their grandma to war in the name of `` equality '' without realizing that will result in * a lost war . 
  yeah , it seemed that way to me , too , but i 'm not a man , so i did n't want to judge . 
  and who exactly is supposed to be caring for the wounded ( and children ) , making uniforms , managing the food supplies , not to mention to other work ( such as making bombs , etc. ), 
  and other things women do during a time of war ? 
  because women will do those things whether or not they 're officially in the army . 
  just like 14-year-old boys will head to the front with or without `` permission . '', 
  having every single person pick up a gun is not efficient . 
  that 's not how it works in reality . 
  you do n't send doctors into combat , either , because that 's not what they 're most useful for . 
  and being on the front lines is * not * the same thing as combat . 
  israel 's got a different situation , though . 
  they need everyone they can get and they 've got an unending problems with the neighbors . 
  sharing a border with russia certainly seems to give one a sense of reality . 
  i was in georgia and ukraine during their wars ( 2008 and parts of 2014/15 respectively ) and * not once * did i hear a man complain about women not going to fight . 
  because when your country is actually under invasion , you want the * most capable * soldiers . 
  it 's not a joke . 
  there 's a lot women can do to help , but combat is n't our forte . 
  a male friend of mine also suggested men will risk multiple other men to save one woman , which is not terribly efficient . 
  i 'm not sure we even know where we 're going ... ( still have n't found that book . 
  it 's old , though ; probably out of print . ), 
   surstr\u00f6mming i 'm sure it 's addressed somewhere , but most likely in a section about execution methods . 
  after all , the point of torture is to get the person to talk , not kill them instantly . 
  could n't let helsinki one-up us , eh ? 
  there 's a book with a lot of photos like these ( comparing old with new ) , but i forgot the name . 
  i 'll post the name it if i can find it . 
  yeah , that 's why i assume it 's not actually contaminated ( with bacteria , etc ) . 
  it was kind of funny the richer district had worse-tasting water than the poorer district , though . 
  i 've also heard that -- that budapest 's tap water is n't safe . 
  i doubt it 's contaminated , just heavily chlorinated . 
  when i lived in the 11th district , i could n't drink the tap water from a glass because of the strong chlorine smell , but the water at my friend 's flat in the 6th district tasted fine . 
  but that was around 5 years ago . 
  overall , it seems they 're using less chlorine now . 
  i have n't noticed such a strong smell anywhere recently . 
  i * knew * there was some east-asian country that has a lot of parliament fights . 
  i just thought it was japan or korea . 
   they are not questioning why does eastern europe reacts differently from them . 
  this is a good point . 
  there 's a general air of disdain and lack of respect . 
  not to derail your post , but it reminds me of [ an article ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/orban-backs-down-in-battle-with-norwegian-ngos/ ) someone posted yesterday in regard to an norwegian ngo operating in hungary . 
  `` budapest has given in . 
  this new development is a total victory for the norwegian view ... '' -- vidar helgesen , norway 's minister of european affairs . 
  regardless of who was right ( and maybe the ngo was right ) , why this attitude of conquering ? 
  it 's disgusting . 
  instead of respectfully negotiating and debating , he has the attitude of forcing `` the norwegian view '' down another country 's throat ? 
  yes , this is just * one * person , but it 's an example . 
  on the other hand , it 's not bad to be held to a high standard of behavior . 
  true . 
   brawl of the month well , they 're certainly interesting neighbors . 
  well , [ japan ] ( https://parliamentfights.wordpress.com/page/2/ ) manages to be a developed country . 
  also , ukraine 's is n't the only one where [ these things happen ] ( https://parliamentfights.wordpress.com/page/2/ ) . 
  thanks !, 
  yes , it sounds better with more people . 
  i kind of just grabbed the first okay-ish version i found . 
  the [ sz\u00e9kely anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4jhygu0dhs ) is rather nice , too . 
  you might like [ a csit\u00e1ri hegyek alatt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebbxrr1btes ) . 
  kind of similar mood . 
  i always thought the 6th was official . 
  but like i say , i ca n't keep track . 
  thanks !, 
  that makes sense . 
  i was just referring to the `` western '' ( december ) versus `` eastern '' ( january ) difference i think the person above was asking about . 
  it makes `` which christmas ? '', 
  a very common question when making plans . 
  that difference is because of the different calendars , of course . 
  so , um ... well , dammit . 
  so many christmases !, 
  is the 24th or 25th the usual day for most christians ? 
  25th , no ? 
  i 'm not even christian ... help . 
  i still do n't know if armenian christmas is officially the 6th or the 7th . 
  considering op , probably lutheran christmas , which is the same as catholic christmas unless lutherans and catholics are having separate christmases now . 
  it might be fun to have three christmases .
