i think the eu should be more the nations of europe and build up long lasting connections with mutual respect , instead of being a pure financial organisation , what it seems to be now . 
  it should be a financial question , but it is a political one ... sad , that the two is washed together so much , without a visible edge . 
  i see only politicians making financial decisions and bankers making politics . 
  normal things , as usual . 
  and you are absolutely right , some politician gets a briefcase of money and if the eu fines us , the people will pay the fine . 
  see if i dont like the statue of liberty , i will not write nonsense about it , like : - its erected it on an indian graveyard , and was made entirely from bones of union soldiers - it represents the womans lost in dark woods , yet we should blame the woods for that - the american dream died , and turned into corporate american bullshit , beacause of this statue terrible . 
  give back the watches !, 
   ( not so ) seriously there is a joke about that here in hungary ( we have jokes on everything ) : first half of the 50 's , lots of people line up before the small town 's clockmaker . 
  an old woman passes by , and asks the people in the back what they are waiting for . 
  - they brought watches form the ussr . 
  the old woman gets excited . 
  - let me trough !, 
  i will recognise mine amongst thousand others . 
  `` hungary - biggest dicks . 
  and i mean that literally . '', 
  lol . 
  no wonder we are called the hung-aryans ...  greetings to the hottest european girls !, 
  i like finland mainly because of ~ ~ apina.biz ~ ~ reasons , 
  great topic !, 
  will say something nice about our close neighbours : austria : love the mountains with the ski resorts , its something charming that we dont have in the flatland croatia : visited the coast many times , great vacation place , people were always very friendly romania : awesome landscapes , mountain-forests , mountain-lakes , breathtaking places , visited many times , people were always helpfull serbia : great waterpolo team , see you in the finals !, 
   slovakia : visited komarno a few times , town night is full with young people and life . 
  hot girls  slovenia : nice economy , good roads troughout the country , you can feel the effort ukraine : only know ukraine from books and papers , read about the rich cultural heritage , would love to visit the castles and temples or towns like lviv, 
  sure , if we count the frankish as germans . 
  another [ conrad ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franz_conrad_von_h%c3%b6tzendorf ) , for your efforts . 
  thats recent news , not a big and long rivalry , 
  hey , dont leave me here with the satanic west and the inferior east !, 
   hm ha , the biggest rival ? 
  maybe the ottomans . 
  and after that austria . 
  no big rivalry nowadays . 
  oil companies . 
  and companies who sell the oil from those oil companies . 
  also overpriced mobile network operators . 
   false friend square , 
  jein , it is called umgebung in this environment . 
  right . 
  and there are not two , but three ( ! ), 
  types of hungarian dishes : the one you cook , the one you boil and the one you paprika . 
  exactly, 
  only close neighbours call hungarians magyars . 
  it should be accepted , from the far-away illiterates , as the abbreviation of the word hungarian . 
  i will not buy this tobacconist 's , it is scratched, 
  you dont really want to use his own words against him ? 
  [ the inspector receives citation stating `` id supplement : invalid weight . 
  possible smuggler admitted . '' ], 
  you do great work here still . 
  wow , you run very strict border here . 
  yes . 
  long time neighbourship wont go away without trace . 
   hungarians took many word from slavic in the 10th c. like tree names : j\u00e1vor - slavic j\u00e1vor - maple jegenye - slavic jagnjed - lombardy poplar l\u00fac - slavic uc - pine ( tree ? ), 
  bor\u00f3ka - slavic borovka - juniper and other botanical elements : bab ( bob - beans ) , kapor ( kopr - dill ) , lencse ( leca - lentil ) . 
  many fish names : csuka ( scuka - pike ) , gal\u00f3ca ( glavatica - agaric ) a [ list of hungarian ] ( http://wiki.startlap.hu/melyek-a-szlav-eredetu-magyar-szavak/ ) words with slavic origin . 
  a [ good read , in hungarian ] ( http://www.sulinet.hu/oroksegtar/data/magyarorszagi_nemzetisegek/altalanos/a_magyarsag_es_a_szlavok/pages/010_magyar_szlav.htm ) , about the relation of the two languages, 
  looks like the devils hooves . 
  ( ( ( \u2190 \uff5e \uff08 o \uff40 \u25bd \u00b4 ) o\u03a8 double twist : varo\u0161 is a word of hungarian origin ( v\u00e1ros - town [ literally : something that has castle ] ), 
  both the article and the bishop are a great help in the migrant crisis . 
  false advertisement is the ground the migrants wanted to go to germany . 
  what if the current false advertisements goal ( scapegoatings ) is to tell wannabe migrants to avoid hungary and so the eu ? 
  naturally just because you dont see coherency , it doesnt mean there is none . 
  make effort to understand the people around you , so you can make the world a better place . 
  youve just put `` hungary is an utter shithole '' in my mouth , and that is - regardless of your patriotic level - unacceptable . 
  sorry if you read that from my comment . 
  im sure its your fault . 
  you have too high expectation on people you dont know . 
  ftfy : many in eastern europe - who think they can live under better circumstances in germany - want to move there . 
  what have you done for the country that makes you think you can judge or universalize hungarians ? 
  you , purple-born are not even worthy to carry the luggage of the immigrants . 
  but go on , stomp on a fellow hungarians spirit , that makes you a bigger person . 
  i was in the country long before you were born , and will be here long after you are gone . 
  after that i will aks you about patriotism . 
  if you take my comment out of its context , it maybe sounds like you described . 
  my point was , that some people actually walked around the topic , and processed the - true or false - informations , and found out that the nirvana is around the corner , or that maybe they have better opportunities somewhere else , and took their chances , or are trying . 
  you cant blame the people when they want to move to a seemingly more prosperous place . 
  i can tell almost the same . 
  can totally relate to your situation . 
  thats it . 
  i woke up normally . 
  unsuspiciously started to drink my coffe , and till i finished i was a liar . 
  you know the old proverb about exceptions . 
  you are blessed , you found your existence home . 
  blaphemy !, 
  how did they manage to photoshop both hungarian battalions on the same picture ? 
  germany - small germany , whats the difference . 
   now i stand here corrected . 
  everyone in eastern europe wants to move to germany for better living . 
  including hungarians . 
  the people newly arrived missed the queue . 
  only already succesfull people could allow to stay in hungary . 
  `` where is gr\u00fazia ( georgia in hungarian ) . 
  there was stalin born , they invented wine , took christianity second , kaha kaladze comes from there , the russians sent tanks there during the olympics , and they too beat up protesters brutally . 
  its still a good place . 
  older people speak russian , younger people speak english . '', 
  in budapest a few years ago they [ renamed a square to tbiliszi square ] ( http://index.hu/belfold/2013/03/07/emleket_allitottak_a_gruz-magyar_baratsagnak_jozsefvaros_peremen/ ) as a sign of friendship , and erected a statue to honor sota rusztaveli . 
  housing people is not a problem . 
  shelter is no luxury in hungary either . 
  but you cant feed yourself and your family with a house . 
  and i hope everyone agrees , that what people really need to sustain themselves is a job with income . 
  i doubt the houses in ireland are empty for no reason . 
  if there would be enough workplace around they would be filled with locals , or poles , or hungarians ... financially speaking giving away free housing might cause trouble . 
  real estate prices would drop and many people would lose their wealth or existence .
