  i remember when i saw it first and thougth : the coreography is perfect . 
  here is [ something ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6llse9onck ) you can be ashamed of  or its [ sequel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hves95iel4i ) [ another wtf ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktclnj4ibm ), 
  here is the most famous scot joke : the scot and his son go to the market to sell a chicken . 
  after they sell it the son asks his father to buy him a slice of melon , now that they have money . 
  the scot buys it and his son eats it . 
  15 years pass , and the scot and his son go to the market again , and sell a cow there . 
  so the boy asks : father , we sold the cow , i grew up , buy me a beer !, 
  are you out of your mind , son ? 
  beer after melon ? 
   for the first time , you 've been given and in the meantime we were sitting there idle and looked through our eyeballs . 
  what comes next , you will look search my pockets for your money ? 
  for not the first time , hungarians offered everything they had for the hope of better work/living circumstances . 
  lets make hunconomy great again , and let the hungarians pay for it ? 
  and you wonder people in hungary start making parallels . 
  closing up the lesser developed east is a political direction . 
  im sure we would notice if someone would abuse that political direction . 
  it doesnt matter if western or eastern union , we average hungarians have to wake up and go to work wach day , regardless of current administration . 
   and you think it 's all some trick to keep you if anyone would only suspect that , we would have exited this union by ourselves already . 
   no one among us is your enemy . 
  wrong , this is not a you and me situation . 
  we are rowing the same boot , but dont expect to do it smiling with a broom in your hand . 
  dont try to seperate unkari . 
  we are all in the eu together , discussing important topics within the frames of eu law . 
  be adult about it and accept that some poeple have different views . 
  i dont think i have to explain you , how good it feels , that after all the occupations , there is finally a local looking guy , who ( seemingly ) gives the shots , and not someone from moscow or vienna/stockholm . 
  [ hungarians usually reject the 1956 asylum seekers too . 
  you are welcome !, 
  its not exclusively for mothers . 
  its for whoever raises the child ( grandparent , husband etc. 
  i live on the moon . 
  people like you chased me there . 
  now i sincerly apologize for being this conservative , and try to behave to fit in in your modern worldview  i pointed out that `` westerners migrating for work to hunland '' already happened in the medivals . 
  in time it changed the culture and ethnical compound of the land , what was later used to claim land and justify wars . 
  knowing world history wont hurt you either . 
  clueless average people like me generally fear changes and are precautious . 
  voting on a referendum can be describe as hatred from your pov ( what other hate crime comes in your mind , that happened against refugees in hungary lately ? 
  ) , but i think only a few ( idiot ) would feel hate towards different people . 
   to be a bigger influence on eastern europes reputation dont worry , the western capitalists are demonized in the local papers aswell . 
  borders are not closed . 
  literally anyone can apply for asylum . 
  they can wait the end of the process in an open safe house or move freely in the eu in the meantime . 
  if their application is declined they are not forced to leave . 
  l\u00e1ngos and goul\u00e1sh each day . 
  i dont say we should get an award for this , but ... eastern europeans should get an award for being this tolerant and such good hosts . 
  flemish - magyar two good friends , fighting together and drinking wine . 
  [ cheers !,

   i do n't think anyone is gagging to keep hungary in the union the eu is nothing more than a fiscal union , so hungary will be released when the costs of keeping it in the union will be higher than the gains from their cheap labour force , tax free market and privatizable state institutes . 
  ( soon ? ), 
   standards and representation , fear and orders two colliding superpowers , fighting to keep half-sovereign states in their circle of interest . 
  i hope you dont want to introduce me to the carpathians . 
  middle earth was ( and is ) a conquested territory . 
  overlords come and go , pillaging the land with the same rhetoric : we only want your good ( s ) . 
  to keep hungary in the ` union . 
   in 20 years , after our investment into eastern europe , when we try to move east for jobs it happened in the medievals already . 
  people who seeked work were welcomed . 
  people who tried to carve out their own kingdom were chased away . 
  also would you please hurry up , there is workforce shortage in every sector . 
  literally no one will hold you back . 
  dont let eastern minimal wages scare you . 
   but pretty annoyed that they are n't giving anything in return hope this opinion is not wide spread , else i have to point out how stupid it is , to too many people . 
  what about their work ? 
  and the taxes they pay in the host country , and their cost of living there . 
  giving up part of the etnical identity to work with foreign people might sound alien to you but it is something eastern europeans have to pay while moving `` freely '' across europe . 
  live your socialism quitly , while eastern europeans work for crumbs in your country . 
  it matters if it happens for the same goal . 
  what does w\u0119gr\u00f3w mean ? 
  its close to w\u0119gry , so is it something hungarian related ? 
  beautiful middle earth , 
  its georgia , but dont know the exact location . 
  i use it as a wallpaper , 
  [ mfw after 6 months , still ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/49y3i4/why_did_czechoslovakia_split_up_pre%c4%8do_sa/d0whoai ), 
  only because they didnt inveted drahtzaun back then , 
  hungarians tried that too . 
  but got confused after two . 
  because a paprika has only two sides . 
  latvians got confused after six . 
  because only six toes . 
  but whats your excuse ? 
  that was the old europe . 
  the new one will revolve around the warsaw - budapest central rod . 
  its simple . 
  `` we didnt herded goose together '' means we were stealing horses in the meantime , 
  isnt this what the su/eu was/is for ? 
  we could , but the issue is just too popular to be widely ignored . 
  neighbouring state conquested land from the halfempire = bad . 
  its a wave i would ride anytime . 
  administration makes the ethnic, 
  domination : teams compete to control various control points to earn points and win the map . 
  force christiainize my neighbours , and marry foreign princesses . 
  as tradition . 
  its a public holiday there too , and almost for the same reason ( founding the country ) . 
  i shamefully forgot it . 
  you are welcome . 
  founded by the ministry of silly holidays , 
  wake up early for your gold , 
  maybe typing `` blank europe map for reddit '' in google was not a good idea afterall .

  was thinking about adding the map of the [ region , formerly known as kingdom of hungary ] ( http://trollfesz.cc/i/219355.jpg ) , or ~ ~ magyarize ~ ~ colorize some parts of the surrounding - ia 's . 
  i regret nothing .
