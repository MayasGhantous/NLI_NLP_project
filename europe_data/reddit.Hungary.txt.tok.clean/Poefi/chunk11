  europe : at any given day , someone , somewhere is celebrating something . 
  aw , didnt knew . 
  map needs to be fixed !, 
  no more wonder , map was here first . 
  you are probably right , but its hard to imagine it , without a proper map , can you post one please ? 
  just for us to see clear . 
  sorry for spain , i used the first `` blank '' map i found , and didnt checked for previous edits . 
  ... and grab the popcorn . 
  its a famous proverb , just like gerrit 's .

  namely that m\u00e1ty\u00e1s has a cult in slovenia . 
  in the hungarian version of the fable / [ m\u00e1ty\u00e1s kir\u00e1ly a barlangban ] ( http://mek.oszk.hu/06500/06599/06599.htm ) / they only wait till his beard grows two times around the table . 
  and thats why we have so many chained-dog-headed people in the country , neat , 
  but hun , i didnt saw orban in the list ... huns are maybe related to 0,000001 % of todays population , but its not written in stone or wooden stick < :d in the hindsight maria theresa could have been a better ruler to start off with . 
  she was related to a whole hungarian hussar army . 
  edit + s, 
  hunnic/attila was an excellent choice . 
  nice , i dont live too far , but never knew this exists , 
  yea , what can we win with that ? 
  why the referendum at all ? 
  the politicans were already elected legitimately . 
  i dont want to sacrafice another sunday morning just to support them again . 
  unnecessary handwash . 
  for me 2016 was the year of surprises . 
  but i wouldnt be surprised if the outcome of the vote would be ` refugee welcome ' .

  now its sure that even angels eat beans . 
  the dead are leading the scared living . 
  sadly the whole eu , including the uk referendum is heavily infused with materialism . 
  for me , the referendum reads `` sorry , but we dont have the money for the membership fee '' http://i.imgur.com/ieifewb.jpg, 
  scored goals since 1972 : 2 , conceded : 0 . , 
  hungary : no conceded goals on ecs since 1972 . 
  there is something wrong with the moon . 
  the correct term is diplomacy , 
  500 huf here at the austrian border , and you pick them yourself . 
  after thousand years living next to eachother it would be surprising if they were not similar . 
  nice try . 
  i usually cook p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt for two weeks in advance on each sunday , and make guly\u00e1s from the leftover on a saturday . 
  well , you didnt had to smuggle the recipe here from inner asia , 
  its dangerous , because what if you wont have place for the stew ` goulash ' because of the tasty soup ? 
  its not about the time of consumption , its about the way of preparation . 
  the one is soupy and the other is solid . 
  p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt is ( was ) one of the three main categories of hungarian cuisine . 
  paprik\u00e1s ( food you paprika ) , p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt ( food you roast ) , and foods you neither paprika or roast ( including guly\u00e1s ) . 
  so you put the name of the animal you sacraficed for the dish before its name . 
  edit : typo, 
  its basically just flour and some tissue mixed together , 
  carpathian culture group since 1.16 , 
  its [ p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt ] ( https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/p%c3%b6rk%c3%b6lt ), 
  goulash is the soup , not the main dish . 
  [ pulciono pio ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dked8fjlr8 ), 
  aw , would loved to learn a bit more about it . 
  what do you think is the closer by meaning ( from the hungarian proverbs ) : `` my littlest concern is bigger than that '' or `` the neighbours cow should be wasted too '', 
  thats very interesting . 
  can you proszim provide the origin or a little more info on this proverb ? 
  ah , the adriatic coast < 3,

  the town 's major , [ porga gyula ] ( https://veol.hu/data/kepgaleria/megkezdudott_veszpremben_a_finnugor_kulturalis_fuvaros_programsorozat/pk0122finnugorfovaros1.jpg ) expressed , that the title holders , both veszpr\u00e9m and [ iszkaszentgy\u00f6gy ] ( https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/iszkaszentgy%c3%b6rgy ) will be displaying finno-ugric culture , with program series throughout the year , transmitting their values to whole europe .

  he added : this year 's programs are based on veszpr\u00e9m 's strong finno-ugric customs , supported by the 40 years old relationship with [ tartu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tartu ) and [ rovaniemi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rovaniemi ) . 
  there will be literary , musical , fine arts and theatric events , also presenting and attending customs will have a great role , just as scientific , linguistic and economical conferences . 
  the estonian week , starting mid march will be an important element of the program series , here enquirers can befriend estonian culture , fine arts and music -- said porga gyula . 
  the major of iszkaszentgy\u00f6rgy , [ g\u00e1ll attila ] ( http://www.vehir.hu/data/image/full/2016/01/22/dsc_8533-v-kk.jpg ) spoke that the settlement wants to \u201e receive the finno-ugric world '' , and also to show itself , and the living connection with the finno-ugric folks is a good base for that . 
  in her opening speech , ruttkay-mikli\u00e1n eszter , president of the [ reguly company ] ( http://www.regulytarsasag.hu/ ) toned , that the displayed exhibition of the udmurt porte 's unique structure -- the work of linguist , researcher sal\u00e1nki zsuzsanna - is the nice display of the living connection of the udmurt and hungarian nations . 
  ruttkay-mikli\u00e1n eszter reminded , that the early 1990 's was a major breaktrough in the fields of finnugristic , when other than russian researchers were able to reach finno-ugric speaking areas , and had the opportunity to personally research , what they only learned from books till that point . 
  it was the first time , that the creator of the travelling exhibition of the reguly company , sal\u00e1nki zsuzsanna stepped on udmurt land , and unbroken since then she keeps researching the folks life . 
  in 2014 the first holder of the finno-ugric capital of culture title was the udmurt populated sztarije bigi , in russia . 
  in 2015 the estonian [ obinitsa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/obinitsa ) became the finno-ugric capital of culture , where the [ szetu ] ( https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/szetu_nyelv ) -- a [ south-estonian ] ( http://www.uralic.org/photos/announcement%202016_3.jpg ) dialect -- speaking minority lives . 
  its the first time a [ hungarian settlement received ] ( http://www.veszprem.hu/veszpremieknek/images/stories/hir_2016/2016_01/160120_finn_01.jpg ) this honor .

  its like a normal coat but with that furry hood thing on it .
