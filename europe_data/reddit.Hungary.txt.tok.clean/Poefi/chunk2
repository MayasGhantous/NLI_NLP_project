  with that effort you could burn the empty houses straigth down , that would cause less damage . 
  save up the surplus for real refugees .

  everyone in the region knows the legend of [ hany ist\u00f3k ] ( http://www.kapuvar.hu/_site/img/text22711/hanyistok.jpg ) ( stephan swamp , ~ tarzan of the swamps ) : in march , 1749 fishermen from [ kapuv\u00e1r ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kapuv%c3%a1r ) captured a 8-10 years old boy near [ kings lake ] ( https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/kir%c3%a1ly-t%c3%b3 ) . 
  the boy was unable to speak , was wild , and if we can belive the old reports , he adapted the swamp life : he was afraid of humans , was naked , his skin thickened and furry , he had two lids , and between his fingers you could notice web . 
  he could swim very fast and catch fishes underwater . 
  he ate grass , raw fish and frogs . 
  according to church records , they baptize him to istv\u00e1n ( stephan ) on march 17 , and added hany as a family name , what was the nearby swamp 's ( hans\u00e1g ) common name . 
  they took him to the castle , where the castellan became his `` warden '' . 
  we know his story from the castellans journal . 
  he never learnt to speak , only imitated animal voices . 
  they were never able to teach him anything , so his duty was to carry water and turn the roast . 
  the hajd\u00fa ( 18th c. police ) often beat him , and when escaped , they hunted him down with dogs and brought him back . 
  later when he used to see humans , they managed to put cloths on him and made him try cooked food , but ist\u00f3k remained on the swamp diet . 
  only the daughter of the castellan stood up for him , so when she finally got married to a lord , ist\u00f3k - as a sign of goodwill - bought a bowl of frogs to the bridal , and put it on the table . 
  so he was beaten again . 
  after this incident he escaped and was never seen again in the town . 
  old fishermen would often mix him with the will-o ' - the-wisp 's of the swamp .

  i know there was a romanian-hungarian friendship in the [ past ] ( http://adatbank.transindex.ro/html/cim_pdf1003.pdf ) , and im sure there will be one in the future .

  10/10 would ally again, 
  i meant to say that . 
  thats why i found it interesting . 
   i guess they meant rose petals in water . 
  i hope they still got laid , and stuck their nose where it belongs . 
  oh , i guess belgian woman are just as beautiful as hungarians . 
  if not just proceed them to the rose baths . 
   legends say the average hungarian girl looks like an eastern european porn star . 
  the stereotype of the beautiful hungarian girl is a [ hungaricum ] ( https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarikum ) , and they are the country 's main export merchandise . 
  they are hard to get , but not too hard , and being soft and warm is not only their privilege . 
  also you can adjust the pleasant odour thanks the roll-on deodorant .

  couple of years ago i visited my friends and took the train . 
  it was a 3 hour trip , and i silently sat right next to a crowd of young german people . 
  i understood every single thing they said , without them realizing , and it was hilarious . 
  they were a cheerful band , on their way to the sziget ( festival ) , and they commented/narrated everything what they/we saw from the train windows : the animals , the meadows , the ruined suburbs , the people passing by on the platforms etc. 
  they said nothing too embarrassing . 
  i was smiling inside , when they asked eachother `` what if this guy ( me ) understands us ? '', 
  or `` what do you think , does this guy understands what we say ? 
  '' , but then they just kept chatting about random things . 
  i wont forget when they spoke about the beautiful hungarian woman , one of them said ( this was the most interesting part for me ) : `` hungarian girls are beautiful , have soft and aromatic skin , becasue they bath in rose petals '' . 
  all of them agreed . 
  finally i got busted , when they got off the train and one of them forgot their backback . 
  so i rushed after them and said ( in german ) `` one of you guys left his backpack on the seat , take care '' . 
  heh , they looked so confused .

  has nothing to do with communism , since family names were born in the 9th - 12th c. , from my previous comments : there are more theories about how family names were born and used from the 9th - 12th c. a popular one says it has linguistic and traditional reasons why hungarians use family names first and given names after . 
  linguistic reason is that the two words relate each other in a modifier structure . 
  traditional reason is , that when family names were introduced the magyar cultural elite 's self awarness was so high , they decided to oppose the western practice and made names a little different . 
  you get used to it fast , so it feels pretty normal .

  i dont laugh for fear it will encourage you to tell more jokes . 
  edit : sry i already bugged you with this , 
  not especially these jokes , but jokes generally are popular in hungaristan . 
  see you can easily replace the hero of the joke with someone else ( fe . 
  policemen , mother in law , blonde woman , jew , gipsy , firemen etc. ) . 
  most popular jokes imo are the naughty jokes , or the old-wise-country-man vs. educated-townsman jokes or szekler jokes . 
  i think these `` protect the few what you already have '' jokes are popular because hungarians can relate to the situation . 
  you laugh devilish : ehe-he , i can spare a few copper by making someone else suffer a bit , or ah-haha , i would do just the same mistake trying to make my life easier . 
  see a hungarian can easily relate to the boy and his father in this joke , because they know , that in hungary if you get a cheap present as a child from your hard working parents , you can be sure your parents will hold it against you in the next 15 years . 
  i just wrote about the possible reasons why scot jokes are popular in magyarland a few comments before : `` according to some papers the origin of the hungarian scot jokes is the scots `` protect , what you already have '' mentality . 
  another factor , that might fueled these jokes is the envied 18th c. bank credit reform , what made edinburgh a great financial center . '',

  and yes , you got it right , the fruit was the odd one out . 
  explaining would kill the joke . 
  use thy imagination ... 
  here is the most famous scot joke : the scot and his son go to the market to sell a chicken . 
  after they sell it the son asks his father to buy him a slice of melon , now that they have money . 
  the scot buys it and his son eats it . 
  15 years pass , and the scot and his son go to the market again , and sell a cow there . 
  so the boy asks : - father , we sold the cow , i grew up , buy me a beer !, 
  - are you out of your mind , son ? 
  beer after melon ? 
  wow , nice pic . 
  i never knew barcelona is from the iss . 
  this is how an average hungarian comment looks like : a different guy from ukraine used bad slovak language in comments on asylum refugee immigrant groups , in fact he is already camping here , do something , call the romanian police.hu,
