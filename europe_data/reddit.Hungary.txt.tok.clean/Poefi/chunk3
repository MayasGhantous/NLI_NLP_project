  i never said we can stop them . 
  but the world is changing . 
  with the help of todays tech we might stand a chance . 
  but i see your points . 
  that is the ideology of the revolution . 
  all people are equal . 
  as long as they dont speak foreign and accept the local culture . 
  i cant relate to that since i live in a h\u00e9t\u00e9r\u00e9gone country . 
  we have actual minorities . 
  with legal rights . 
  the human species is not on the verge of extinction . 
  europe neither . 
  lets talk about the embraced utopia when they are . 
  building fences and making good profit from it and from migration is politics . 
  and im not drunk enough to discuss it further . 
  exactly . 
  you see that happens when you dont try hard enough to stop migrants . 
  they cross borders and rivers with pagan practice and then they want to stay forever . 
  and one day you look down , and ask yourself : why didnt we tried harder to stop them ? 
  see , it is the question that i dont want to hear 100 years in the future  also thanks for ... . 
  also its time to untagle the mistery , what happened to the poor lascaux cavemans . 
  i bet you ate them and still use their caves as shelter . 
  bor means wine , so it means ( their ) wine . 
  the greeks had dionysus , the romans bacchus and legends say the huns and magyars had bor tengri , god of rebirth and a ritual place with the same name . 
  the grapes fermention - changing into something better - is a symbol of rebirth , and wine was already considered as the drink of the gods , so the name bor stuck on the fermented grapes . 
  and now it is one of the oldest magyar words , with hunnic origin . 
  and bar\u00e1t means friend , prolly comes from slavic brat . 
  haha or lol . 
  and you use `` ehe-he '' if you want to laugh elegantly . 
  means `` to the eurovision with it '' , so yes, 
  they are lucky they are alive . 
  [ shhhh ] ( http://www.nemzetorseg.hu/images/gyms_140321/lengyelmagyar.jpg ) , just dont let anyone else know , that we have other feelings than hate , 
  make us proud , by following tradition and being the strong eastern bastion of europe , 
  i think i have a good explanation for the tisza line . 
  before the communist regime collapsed their hungarian red army recaptured northern hungary ( today part of slovakia ) what was ( in their pow ) occupied by czechslovak forces . 
  so the antant promised to retreat from the tisza line ( to the east , transylvania ? ), 
  if the red army retreats from northern hungary . 
  the hungarian red army retreated , the romanian army did not , so they fought a last battle at the tisza line and the red army was destroyed , so romanians continued to push to budapest and westwards , seemingly for no good reason , since at the end they were sent back to transylvania by the antant anyway . 
  moral ? 
  dont fall for false promises !, 
  curtain . 
  thanks for sharing your pow . 
  i see your points , but did not agree all on them . 
  in 1918 ww1 was already `` over '' , and austria-hungary was divided among the winners . 
  why anyone bothered to find someone in hungary to legitimize the peace treaty stays a mystery . 
  the winners could just attach the whole ex koh territory to romania or serbia just as easy as they did not . 
  were they afraid of another revolution ? 
  or it would have been too much and they were just searching for a `` rightful '' cause to start another war ? 
  i think the antant knew what they are doing . 
  presenting an unjust peace treaty to the now allyless hungarian government will give them a cause to start another war . 
  a war within a war . 
  and this is exactly what happened . 
  the short lifespan communist regime did fought the ( in their pow ) occupiers , and made some gains but finally lost against the antant . 
  france and uk promised many things for withdrawal of forces to both hungary and romania - my favourite one is that it wont hurt - and we can see who the really winner of this conflict was . 
  after 100 years we still hate eachother for a third party promise . 
  my sources say the romanian army left hungary in 1920 after giving weapons to horthy and his `` national '' guard , where you got this 1923 ? 
  clearly our historycal knowledge is different on this issue . 
  pre ww1 a-h and post ww1 hungarys story is a long read , but its worth the time , if you want to feel sympathy for hungarians . 
  i cant provide you a good english source , wikipedia should be a good place to start or look . 
  i sincerly hope i am serious . 
  because it would be a rough joke . 
  edit : - a, 
  just beacuase i am the one who feels that it was unjust , doesnt mean it was not . 
  i see your other point . 
  its true , hungarians should be grateful for the freedom trianon gave them . 
  but also note romanians should thank france and britain that they were allowed to fight in a war in which they had no original interest . 
  fact that austria-hungary lost a war . 
  fact that post war hungary was still occupied because no one signed the peace treaty . 
  fact that neither hungary or romania got what they deserved . 
  we dont have to search for justice in a war . 
  also be a bit more constructive when discussing . 
  so greedy romania wanted the tisza line , and the inferior hungarians wanted transylvania . 
  both were denied . 
  are we even ? 
  this foreign pressure to come to and go from hungary is the result of romania being part of the antant . 
  and the occupation of hungary was the result of hungary 's hesitation to sign an unjust peace treaty , that ended ww1 . 
  the part that says france or serbia or england had nothing to do with the treaty of trianon and that it was the romanian army that decided the new borders . 
  its like saying politics had nothing to do with it . 
  also we can only speculate what would have happened if the romanian army kept occupying hungarian territorries . 
  i dont have a dictionary , but delsuionist is fine . 
  its someone who chases false dreams . 
  ( or did i got it wrong ), 
  hey wait for my reply , i live in a different timezone and i wake up 1 hour later  i didnt really expected you to feel the unjust that happened with the treaty . 
  i also know the treaty was just an episode of a bigger political game . 
  and that it was more important to have an anti german mid-east europe than the tradition/ethnic of the people who lived there . 
  post ww1 revolutionary hungary was a special place in europe . 
  stating romanians alone drew its borders still counts as a delusion . 
  and i know that you love your hungarians , and almost gave autonomy to them . 
  on a land where they lived for centuries . 
  nothing could be better . 
  i still care . 
  the part that says france or serbia or england had nothing to do with the treaty of trianon and that it was the romanian army that decided the new borders . 
  its like saying politics had nothing to do with it . 
  also we can only speculate what would have happened if the romanian army kept occupying hungarian territorries . 
  i thought only we have delusionists .
