  you made my day , 
  see exactly this is the issue . 
  there is a huge injustice , that you cant reverse or change . 
  only thing you can do is to be butthurt about it . 
  it might be not healthy but its the only thing you can do when you cant do nothing . 
  you are right . 
  every middle european country in the region got its liberty with the treaty , including hungary . 
  still , its hard to celebrate with dicktaste in your mouth . 
  so please dont ask to celebrate with you . 
  for services rendered , the emperor gave you ... a tiny garden with a small capital . 
  ww1 not 2 . but indeed , it took the great powers 2 years to find someone who almost willingly signed the peace . 
  we prefer magyar to hungarian . 
  in hoc signo vinces . 
  a beautiful display of eastern european teamwork , 
  indeed , hungary 's record is a big surprise on the list for me :p, 
  strikes are rare in hungary , sometimes railway employees do a one or two day strike , but its quickly over . 
  a 1m $ plane and no cup holders ? 
  whats the trend ? 
  people move to cities for better living , to find jobs , to find more opportunities . 
  and if they become real succesfull in the everyday race , they can move to a remote village , and enjoy the benefits of a peaceful life . 
  energy . 
  power . 
  my people are addicted to it . 
  their dependence made manifest after the ~ ~ sunwell ~ ~ south stream was destroyed . 
  welcome to the future ... a pity you 're too late to stop it . 
  no one can stop me now . 
  they sure mean we still use lead pipes and that [ some water regions failed at the eu quality ] ( http://rewrite.origos.hu/s/img/i/1208/20120809-hol-szennyezett-az-ivoviz-arzen.jpg ) test, 
  they look slow because of your big flat screen . 
  buy a smaller tv and they will look faster . 
  if they get the correct player/ball ratio i am statisfied . 
  violence is the privilege of the state . 
  but even if the valiant officers did this to scare the wannabe criminals , or their parents , or to prevent crime - it just looks like abuse . 
  my second question : why would anyone record something like this ? 
  they showed it to their boss : look how hard we fought crime today ? 
  if the western effendi dies , we will divide his territory and distribute his wealth source : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/congress_of_visegr%c3%a1d_ ( 1335 ), 
  thats kind , 
  i thougth the same , 
  the numbers might mislead you . 
  i guess it reads : hungary 1.5 - hungarians speak hungarian and 50 % speaks a foreign language germany 2.0 - germans speak german and 100 % speaks a foreign language i must think everyone else above 2.0 cheated ( can speak own language + a ~ very identical neighbour language + a foreign language ) how to survive in your own country with your mothertongue ? 
  hmm-ha , with work , with kindness , with brute force , etc. 
  :d edit : grams, 
   when things go well , people tend to appropriate the successes as their own while also attributing the failures of others to their own actions populism 101 . after this sob-inducing intro i almost belived that there is justice in government administration . 
  but there is only law . 
  a pack of legal cases . 
  according to this legal system a business could be either lawful or unlawful . 
  if its unlawful it could be annuled or vetoed by a lawyer or expert or the eu or someone who gets paid for that . 
  why is this contract still around , if its unlawful ? 
  get rid of it , start new . 
  you just accused hungarians with connivance , but the populace dont even know the details . 
  you really want modern hungarian debt-slaves to risk everything they have for a legal case and start a revolution for that ? 
   and conversely , at some point some hungarians will have to make a stand , too . 
  lecturing you from the netherlands or any other better-run country is these better run countires have errors and political scandals of their own , what would make them more appealing than hungary ? 
  brb got ta hire my spouse . 
  thanks for sharing this . 
  different places , different cultures . 
  lets agree that we both love our country . 
  i cant promise we will change the pm till it chooses windmills over atomkraft . 
  i would personally favor an eu powerplant against a russian one , but a suitcase of money would always win the argument . 
  with that `` logic '' and the same amount of effort we could change the rest of the world . 
  stop wasting my time , kiddo , 
  holland 's dictatorship is way better than hungary 's . 
  who are you to judge ? 
  you still live under the opression of a king , 
  must be damned good to live live in that parellel universe . 
   but if it suits you : thank you very much for your allowance , your highness , without you we would be but nothing . 
  hey , cool we have much in common !, 
  my grandma speaks fluent croatian , i will let her double check the proverbs . 
  hm , to get even with you i tried to google for a polish village called fasz ( dick in hungarian ) , but could not find any  kut means `` well '' and benzinkut means `` gas station '' ( literally benzin well ) . 
  and you can legally call a gas station personnel kutas in hungary . 
  nagykutas means literally ( something is/has a ) big-well . 
  [ the hungarian name for polacy is lengyel , i found this village ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lengyel ) , and i learned we have a [ lengyel culture ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lengyel_culture ) in hungary . 
  [ lets fight !, 
  ] ( http://www.googlefight.com/index.php?word1=pannonian+basin&amp;word2=carpathian+basin )  jokes aside . 
  [ the term carpathian basin ( named like this because of the long carpathian border ) has been translated from hungarian literature , while the south slavic languages , as well as slovak and german , use the corresponding terms of pannonian basin . 
  in english , both names can be used . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pannonian_basin ) but you are right , part of the carpathians is not visible , and pannonian basin is only the lower part of the carpathian basin . 
  and hungarians are alone in the k\u00e1rp\u00e1t-medence , since no one else uses the term . 
  a hard to defend flatland border could make sense , well ... to your enemies  a-h 's and koh 's `` natural '' borders were the easily defendable mountains . 
  pick your favourite from [ the 750 most popular hungarian proverbs ] ( http://mek.oszk.hu/00200/00242/00242.htm ) including : do not look at the tooth of a gift horse . 
  he who gets up early finds gold . 
  the stake of the play is not beans . 
  one can not strip two hides from one fox . 
  clothes do not make the man . 
  clothes make the man . 
  it matters , because we took our time and looked after it !, 
   im sure the word '' \u00c9l\u0151 '' ( live in hungarian ) is the osd from m1 . 
  but since everything is digital , with little effort you can change any part of the original screen ( fe . 
  a flag ) . 
  its alright , it disturbs me too that i cant present you a good source for this . 
  maybe this happened before people could take pictures with their phones ? 
  maybe it was in another country ? 
  ( i sincerly hope i did not made the whole thing up  ) i looked after my bad examples . 
  newspapers wrote the pamplet was given to fans in bucharest by the locals , but no one took the blame for it officially . 
  for the second example , im not a broadcast expert but i think the osd is part of the original signal , again no one took blame for it . 
  measured from the base or from the balls ? 
  it translates to that , exactly , 
   ... might be called orderly , but they are certainly not fair '' , is it unethical ? 
  maybe . 
  is justice a factor ? 
  no , just law .
