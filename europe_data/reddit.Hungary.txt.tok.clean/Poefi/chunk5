  huh , i stopped watching sport events a while ago so i cant recall the exact situation . 
  but i remember it seeing live on tv a couple of times . 
  i mean at the national hymns - when they raise the flags - hungarian flag was raised wrong side up , and everyone went : bastards , shame , etc. 
  i mean on romanian sport events the hungarian flag is often mixed with the italian ( or even slovak ) flag . 
  : o what is ( if not willful ) awkward/funny because it only requires a minimal knowledge of national flags to get the correct one , so why no one double checks it ? 
  unprecetended . 
  never heard of a flag mix up from romania . 
  funny that the hungarian word for church `` templom '' comes from latin , but no one else calls churches templom ... when saying `` templom '' i imagine a bigger church , something between a `` k\u00e1polna '' ( chapel ) and a sz\u00e9kesegyh\u00e1z ( cathedral ) the ancient word kyriakon was maybe originally used to describe the church ( like in `` krisztus '' ( christ ) or `` kereszt '' ( cross ) ) but in hungarian it evolved to : `` kereszt\u00e9ny '' ( christian ) , the ancient greek variant ecclesia is still used to describe the whole economic unit of the local church : `` ekl\u00e9zsia '' ( ecclesiastic ) but it sounds oldish , so its not used often . 
  the ancient greek variant basilike is used to describe a very big ~ ~ temple ~ ~ church : `` bazilika '' ( ~ basilic ) the ancient latin castellum in hungarian : `` kolostor '' what means `` monastery '' ~ the living quarters of monks, 
  what is this ? 
  a border for ~ ~ bikes ~ ~ ants ? 
  originally i searched for a deep-in-the-forest bordercrossing i visited as a kid , but it was demolished in 2006 .

  i dont belive you . 
  was worth scrolling through . 
  everything is better since its hdr ,

  i will comment !, 
  ofc without knowing too much details ... hungary has a nuclear plant that was built in the ~ 70s by the soviets . 
  and they plan to build another reactor there . 
  what might lower electric bills , so its a good thing . 
  i 've read the `` only '' problem is that there was no tendering procedure . 
  and this is unfair . 
  there are prolly other eu companies with good nuclear technology who could make an offer . 
  but tbh after this blame ( with the winner already choosen ) i dont really want a delusive tender . 
  why the 30y classification ? 
  i doubt that after 30 years we could find out how `` right '' this deal was . 
  after 30 years no one will remember this and those who were responsible will be in retirement homes or long dead . 
  according to the map some of them are hung-aryans . 
  a healthy nationalism feeds on the strongest image of the glorious past . 
  sad thing the ancestors - unless they were nobles - could only terra form the land but not the culture .

  now kiss , 
  legend says magyars conquested middle earth ... i ask you : if the magyars arrived on horses , where are now those horses ?!, 
  check mate and the dominoes fall !, 
  i never understood why it was that important issue . 
  more important question : who were the conquestors and who were the conquested ? 
  and what have the romans ever done for us ? 
  the map is very simplified . 
  the magyars conquested the carpathians , and established the ground of the hungarian culture , yet the map suggests that the two were the same . 
  : o [ nothing similar ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5cskyq4tkq ),

  in hungary , the duster was the 7th most popular car in 2013 , and the 4th in 2014 . the skoda octavia seems to be unbeatable in the logan 's category . 
  true , you need 4x4 for the awesome ~ ~ holes ~ ~ roads, 
   you can go visit transilvania [ i did that already ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xxarlwb.jpg ) , nice place , would gladly live there if i could leave the city and work behind , maybe when i get old and successfull . 
   lol , you are `` romanian '' ( or pre-magyar `` local '' if you do n't like `` romanian '' ) too !!, 
  thats my point exactly and im glad we arrived there . 
  you can be lebeled magyar any time , and i can be called romanian too and it wouldnt change our ancestry or culture at all . 
  the land , the clay , transylvania would stay cold , and indefferent . 
  maybe our world view would change a bit , lets call us local loosers  . 
  ( modern magyars are proud for their szittya ( scythian ) ancestry ) . 
  more important question : what have these different conquestors apart from the sanitation , the medicine , education , wine , public order , irrigation , roads , a fresh water system , and public health ever done for us ? 
  they looked like they are trying to bring peace but did exactly the opposite . 
   my opinion : because the conquering magyars were not able to impose their culture and language on enough people you are probably right , the nobles and kings spent too much time on themselves and high culture , on intriques and politics and didnt cared enough or at all for the common people and their `` culture '' . 
  since there were so many different tribes , and they were considered replaceable or nomadic anyway . 
  i think both romanian and magyar and even hungarian was the cultural product of the carpathian basin , so they are local cultures , sure they claim to be the successors of more ancient and foreign cultures , but they became successfull and developed locally , helping and relying on eachother . 
   so they changed the culture of the land . 
  that is when you lost transilvania . 
  maybe in the sense of my previous sentences , like the common peoples culture was ignored , till the boiling point when the leadership was removed , and everyone grabbed what they could . 
  what was in transylvania in the `` beginning '' : local people were lived , worked and died there , conquestors administrated it , there was peace , it was guarenteed by foreign super powers . 
  / the losing of transylvania clay is documented pretty well , so you can have a picture on the hungarian nobles pov , what modern hungarians share . 
  and its not a nice picture . 
  shortly after the biggest military succes ( 1848 ) and diplomatic succes ( 1867 ) magyars have ever seen , they lost half the country in less than 50 years . 
  we can read wwi soldier diaries about their home coming , that when the hungarian honv\u00e9ds returned from fighting - victorious form the italian front - they were confused to see that the war was lost and a-h was no more , the communists were already hanging priests and officials all around the land , there was an anti govermnent revolution in transylvania , obviously accusing the habsburg/magyar nobles for everything , and then the new commanders took their weapons away and dismantled the army . 
  this lack of army is considered for the main reason that transylvania was lost , but i bet politics also have to do with all that ( and ofc magyarization too , as a political direction , but there were many other factors ) . 
  / and what changed ? 
  the same local people are living there , with the administration of different conquestors , in peace , guarenteed by foreign super powers . 
   so hungary would have lost transilvania to others anyway . 
  well i would argue about that . 
  just imagine a more hard or succesfull magyarization instead of harrassing south slavs . 
  i dont say hungarians defended the kingdom all alone , but romania didnt conquered it alone either .
