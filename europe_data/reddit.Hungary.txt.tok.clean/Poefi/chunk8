  imagine the hard work , poor op did to look pcish , by cropping the rest of the universe ... 
  nice , but you made it with a potato ? 
  why is it so blurry ? 
  once you get the alphabet its not that hard . 
   yes , ` sz ' is the hard 's ' , and 's ' is 's ( h ) ' , so ` zs ' is like the ` j' in jean . 
  both turkish and hungarian are agglutinative languages , thats why the grammar can be similar . 
  so i guess your alphabet letters are also always pronounced the same , and you have to learn them only once . 
  its cool , probably the different grammar  the shorter - landless ` adjective ' version doesnt sound alien at all when talking about countries , and sometimes its used in speech . 
  you could use : `` megyek olaszba / im going ( to ) italian '' and it would be the same as `` megyek olaszorsz\u00e1gba / im going to italy '', 
  ok , but the ending is still - ska or - sko , isnt it ? 
  does that too stands for land or country , like - orsz\u00e1g or - istan ? 
  they will sure appreciate it , 
  nope , it would be written like 'm \u00e1dzs\u00e1r ' then . 
  its pronounced like a hard 'd ' in duty . 
  its really called ` gy\u00e9 ' but i found this ' [ gy\u00e1 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/voiced_palatal_plosive.ogg ) ' on wiki to listen . 
  the turkish ` c ' ( like in yumurcak ) is ` dzs ' in hungarian , so i guess you pronounce dzsudzs\u00e1k `` cucak '', 
  its just that hungarian is the exonym and magyar is the local name . 
  the two stands for the same i guess , still it would be cool to see magyar or magyarorsz\u00e1g in fe . 
  english instead the exonyms . 
  its so obvious you cant even bet on that . 
  those are also nice exonyms , but this one is the closest to magyarorsz\u00e1g atm  nah , its the same in the two countries . 
  not many ( if any ) countries came up with something else than the two main roots ( h ) ungar or magyar . 
  still interesting . 
  does turkish and czech have many common words ? 
  i remember watching football a few years ago . 
  it was turkey - hungary match - i dont remember how it ended - and i was shocked when i saw macaristan on the scoreboard . 
  i thougth at once : turkey is one of the few countries , who care , and doesnt label hungarians , well ... hungarian  they got the name right , yaay , and also added the cool - istan ending . 
  regardless of the final score we won !, 
  :p then later ive read somewhere that hungarian linguists helped to develop this modern turkish grammar , so its not a big wonder , i guess . 
  i wonder what the latin transcripted name of the medieval kingdom of hungary is in turkish . 
  did i just read arch-angels-ville in russian ? 
  wow , glad you made the [ polish - hungarian friendship ] ( https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/lengyel,_magyar_%e2%80%93_k%c3%a9t_j%c3%b3_bar%c3%a1t ) unique with that special ' \u0118 ' in the country name . 
  why are they so short ? 
  you leave out - maat to spare space ?

  hungarian . 
  didnt gave one perfect answer , still 01 : o, 
  it was a john cleese alimony tour reference ... who knew you wouldnt get my universal humour . 
  thank you for calling magyars * magyars * and not labeling them with an exonym . 
  ftfy : the only thing worth bombing in romania are magyars , 
  [ turanic ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb_qhp7vaze ), 
  and that on the annual [ day of radio broadcast ] ( https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/magyar_r%c3%a1di%c3%b3z%c3%a1s_napja ) !, 
  shame , 
  thats just ... hard to belive . 
  why would anyone detonate something in romania ? 
  i mean the explosives are probably worth more  / s, 
  yes . 
  now look at your failure  everyone comes from ` somewhere ' . 
  what makes someone legal or illegal ` migrant ' ? 
  even the roman empire had its origins , and ofc its colonies didnt miraculously emerged from the blank space on the crossroads of nations . 
   migrants into roman empire . 
  rather tomb raiders than migrants , since the huns destroyed the colonies . 
  re was ~ nowhere when the two arrived . 
  as a matter of fact all slovaks were hungarians too . 
  as were all magyars hungarians . 
  but not every hungarian was magyar . 
  stop . 
  look . 
  think . 
  are you name calling yourself ? 
  no worries , i will ftfy if you still in the right ( ehe-he ) mood : as matter of fact , all magyars are migrants too . 
  our motto : latinizing the aboriginals since ad . 
  i feel sorry for our ` romanian ' brothers and sisters . 
  they ended up with that exonym stuck on them . 
  its like a magyar would call himself hungarian . 
  what ? 
  see thats my point , people blur ancestry , nationality , language , folklore and culture together till the point they lose their original meaning . 
  and it gets worse and worse every day  you can speak different language than your nationality . 
  in extreme cases you will be called minority . 
  their buildings differ , because their cultural self awareness was high , and they expressed their uniqueness that way . 
  saxons supported the unifying of transylvania and romania , they didnt knew , but it turned out to be their doom . 
  romanians followed the assimilation process , the hungarians started , so both saxons and hungarians lost their importance in the region . 
  when romania joined the allies , some saxons left the country and escaped to germany or austria ( hungary was not safe at that point ) . 
  some were deported to soviet ` workcamps ' , and never came back . 
  the failed minority policy of the communist regime led to their mass migration . 
  moving to another communist country was no option , so they moved to their old homeland . 
  i like your questions . 
  its almost like you are thinking , 
   i mean man made structures oh come on . 
  you surely didnt saw everything . 
  but now that you say , i visited transylvania a few times , it feels like a big open-air museum , and yes its rather the nature that catches you there  hope its stay so , rather the beautiful landscapes than ugly ` buildings ' . 
   western roman empire , saxons , whatever they were called , they were not hungarians . 
  allow me to debate it . 
  they were hungarians , with `` saxon '' ethnicity . 
  just like the hungarians in transylvania are now romanians , with hungarian ethnicity .
