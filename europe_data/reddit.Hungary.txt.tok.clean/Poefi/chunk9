  i feel disappointment in your rows . 
  are you saying every wonderous thing comes from rich people , or just that hungarians are poor ? 
  either way you are wrong . 
  lucky for you , im here to help you out from your current state of mind . 
  face the fact , that the ancient hungarian culture left its traces on your culture , and i will tell you its a two way relation . 
  here is your free history lesson for today : nagyszeben was founded by geza i , king of hungary . 
  the name of the city comes from a slavic river : szeben , not from the personal name sibin . 
  geza called in settlers from the western roman empire . 
  you can now call them saxons , but they have nothing to do with the people from saxony . 
  their name `` saxon '' comes from a misunderstanding from the 13th c. , when hungarians started calling ever foreigner with mining privileges saxon also , please stop latinizing the carpathian ground culture , its for our own good . 
  szendvics anyone ?

  there was a joke about the border in the iron curtain era : i would love my country unbounded , 
   c ) which was at the time part of austria-hungary no . 
  tesla was born 1856 , in the habsburg empire . 
  a-h was established in 1867 , and croatia became an autonomus part of koh only after 1867 . it is confusing , 
  everyone knows ** vitamin c ** - a hungarian scientist - szent-gy\u00f6rgyi albert - discovered it in the 30 's ** safety matches ** - everyone uses them , were invented by irinyi j\u00e1nos in 1836 the straub airbag - a double walled inflatable jacket , that protects riders ( the airbag , that protected zara phillips ) - invention leaked so it was unpatentable , it was practically stolen from the inventor , straub tam\u00e1s the dinamo - presented by jedlik \u00c1nyos in 1861 in hungary , patented by siemens in 1866 3,5 '' floppy disk - invented by j\u00e1nosi marcell - patent right lost due administration failure the majority of hungarian scientists and inventors move to foreign lands and sell and produce their inventions there . 
  im not sure they qualify for the topic , since they were presented abroad , but their inventors were born hungarian : color television , moving picture with sound transmission , needleless injection , ballpoint pen , holography , half-automated photography , b\u00e9res-drops , telephone exchange , ** personal computers ** , carbonated water . 
  edit : typo, 
  i never heard of that , why would someone claim he was hungarian ? 
  we have had other inventors with similar great importance . 
  maybe they were confused , since he was born in the austrian empire , in a region that was later part of the kingdom of hungary . 
  ~ ~ croatian is not so off , but even the wikipedai says he was serb . ~ ~ the hungarian wikipedia says he was croatian-serbian-american inventor , with serbian nationality . 
  the croatian wiki says he was a croatian-american . 
  the serbian wiki says he was a serbian and international . 
  the english wiki says he was a serbian-american . 
  good luck with that . 
  and all the other nations - including austria and hungary - waited eagerly but patiently to be independent . 
  procurer : ok , its a wired fence , but how will it look with the building ? 
  designer : i will make a quick sketch on the spot right away . 
  wine , cuisine ... and hospitality . 
  not the one portrayed in the media . 
  maybe a tambura band , with neckties . 
  thats sad . 
  a similar story : i remember a few years ago a young hungarian police motorcyclist died on-duty , because of an accident caused by his bad tires . 
  before the accident he reported the bad tires a couple of times to his commander , but never received the spare parts . 
  and no one was accounted for anything . 
  this happens when you run your public services ( roads , police etc. ), 
  on budget . 
  hehe . 
  i thougth we will never get to the personal part . 
  its the best part in every argument . 
  you are so confident you sound like an idiot . 
  are we celebrating the invincible red meat grinder ? 
  russia had the same manpower as germany , and was loosing twice as many soldiers as the germans . 
  so germany didnt really needed lenin to take out anyone . 
  but , if france and uk and the rest of the entente didnt rushed to help destroying a-h , today you would call the duma reichstag ii and all the cyrillic alphabet would be gone . 
  predictions are good . 
  maybe in the next ww germany will spare some forces for home defense , and doesnt waste everyone in unnecessary attacks for worthless territories . 
  also , you can not blame overextension on hungary , just because 3-4 short lived revolutionary governments had wet dreams , and made some bad decisions . 
  this was the product of the dead end fascism of the 19th century . 
  against many odds , hungarians peacefully preserved one of the most ancient cultures of europe , and defended a thousand year old border . 
  `` one might wonder why the name `` romania '' became applied to the present nation called romania . 
  the association of the name `` romania '' with the present nation `` romania `` stems from the nineteenth century . 
  in their first appearances in the historical record of the middle ages , the romanians were called `` vlachs '' by chroniclers from hungary and constantinople '' so it was an exonym . 
  from wiki : `` ethnonym valach , used to designate germanic speakers ' romance-speaking neighbours '' no source how vlachs ( ol\u00e1h 's ) called themselfes though . 
  from wiki : romania was formed in 1859 through a personal union of the danubian principalities of moldavia and wallachia , as an autonom state of the turk empire . 
  `` scholars developed the theory that the vlachs were descended from roman colonists and latinized natives who lived in the area north of the danube river during the second and third centuries ad . 
  in the period , the region constituted the roman province of dacia . 
  whether the theory is right or not , it became the basis of romanian nationalist feeling in the nineteenth century . '', 
  so , todays romania is called romania because they ( and russia too ) choosed to be the successors of the eastern roman empire - or as the citizens referred to their empire : simply the roman empire or imperium romanum or romania , and they called themselves the romans . 
  `` modern greeks call themselves `` hellenes , '' like the ancient greeks did . 
  the switch from `` romaioi '' back to `` hellene , '' like the switch from `` vlach '' to `` romanian , '' came from the politics of nationalism in modern times . '', 
   i.e. 
  not at fucking all . 
  military is not the only factor on this issue . 
  you would need to counter your enemies diplomatically and economically too . 
  btw . 
  russia alone would have been an easy bite for a-h and germany in both wwi and wwii . 
  the `` laughing third '' contestants , the real winners of a weak central-eastern europe , [ the powers who wanted a weak central-eastern europe since the medievals , are marked green on this map ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/triple_entente ) . 
  also dont forget we both can be right . 
  as long we dont claim we are talking on scientific level . 
  the moral would be : its not enough to win , but all others should loose too !, 
  due to favorable international situations , the vlachs decided in the 2nd half of the 19th c. , that they had roman ancestors, 
  thats an easy one . 
  western europe . 
  you give too much info . 
  in the meaning that austria-hungary was no more , to counter the german or russian domination , you can . 
  moral here : never accept anything from a foreign worldpower . 
  you will see they dont give it free .

  they only `` worked '' but didnt actually lived in the zoo . 
  the 4 samoyeds were part of an ethnographical exhibition . 
  it sounds weird , but it was common in the 19th c. where you find two year old articles on random topics ? 
   the hungarians are descended from the hun yes , but only traditionally . 
   barbarians are they not yes , by definition : a person living outside , especially north of , the roman empire . 
   strapped their babies heads to force the skull to grow pointy we dont do that anymore . 
  hats kept falling off . 
   most of us got here either 40,000 years ago i have a good unarguable theory too . 
  i raise you the pre-celtic-pre-hungarian-pre-slavic ancestral population , who lived in the carpathian basin since ~ 16million years ago . 
   the huns arrived at teh end of the roman empire be always cautious with armed tourists . 
  when the huns ( not the magyars ) arrived in masses , the roman empire fell apart . 
  relate it to the current situation if you want . 
   bloody foreigners , they should go back to where they came from . 
  and leave you here in your current state of mind ? 
  it would be a shame .
