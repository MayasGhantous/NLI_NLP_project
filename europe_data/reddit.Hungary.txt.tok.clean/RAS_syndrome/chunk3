  nearly half of the goods in the eu [ ( 46 % ) ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/road/doc/broch-road-transport_en.pdf ) are transported by road , it is the most important mode of goods transport and by far the most important land based mode of transport . 
  without cheap and timely freight transport there is no margin , no opportunity and no incentive to invest . 
  wealth and [ trade routes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trade_route ) went hand in hand throughout history . 
  [ according to wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/navies_of_landlocked_countries#non-independent_units ) , among the navies of landlocked countries with non-independent naval units hungary `` has one of the heaviest and most qualified warship battalion in [ east-central europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east-central_europe ) '' . 
  fear us !, 
  today we have some [ nestin-class river minesweepers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ne%c5%a1tin-class_river_minesweepers ) . 
  they were made in yugoslavia in the ' 80-s ; three of the original six are still in active service . 
  here 's a [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9djjhgdk5tc ) of these mighty vessels . 
  another [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viagzvnsp-y ) with less action but more explanation ( in hungarian ) . 
  they were n't `` sent '' anywhere , the migrants boarded the train on their own accord , and the train did n't go in the `` other direction '' , it stopped short in [ bicske ] ( https://www.google.hu/maps/place/bicske/@47.4973452,18.7367437,11.25z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x476a12913ed0e51d:0xd26acb0f7966a0d5?hl=en ) , a town the budapest - vienna line passes through . 
  also , the bicske camp is an [ open refugee camp ] ( http://www.migszol.com/refugee-camps--detention-centers.html ) , not a detention center . 
  neither did hungary . 
  the migrants were [ barred from entering the train station ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/hundreds-of-migrants-stranded-in-budapest-after-police-stop-trains-departing-for-germany-10480596.html ) , but they forced themselves on a train * despite * that . 
  the train was not diverted to another destination , it was stopped short in [ bicske ] ( https://www.google.hu/maps/place/bicske/@47.4973452,18.7367437,11.25z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x476a12913ed0e51d:0xd26acb0f7966a0d5?hl=en ) , where the train would pass through anyway . 
  also , the bicske camp is an [ open ] ( http://www.migszol.com/refugee-camps--detention-centers.html ) refugee camp , they were not locked in . 
   hungary solved their asylum seeker problem by letting ( or making ) people go to austria is that what you think solved hungary 's migrant situation ? 
  slovenia , croatia and greece are also letting migrants pass through , is their migrant situation solved ? 
  as a matter of fact , austria and germany are not stopping the migrant flow either , migrants from the balkan route are turning up in good numbers in sweden , even in finland and norway . 
  you are being rather dishonest here . 
  you are comparing average earners in austria to upper / upper middle class earners in romania , - and the austrian counterpart still makes twice as much . 
  most romanians make around 400-500 $ . 
  hungary is somewhat better off , but still much closer to romania than austria or germany . 
  here 's the [ average ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage ) and [ median ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_median_wage ) wages in the eu . 
  looking at the [ disposable income ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=austria&amp;country2=romania ) ( bottom of the page , under salaries and financing ) does n't close the gap , - the romanian counterpart will have 75 % less money to spend on luxuries than the average austrian . 
  but by all means , if you feel like you are better off here , move to eastern europe . 
  but most qualified workers , - from truck drivers to doctors and engineers , - go the opposite way , to western europe and north america . 
   maybe 800-1000 euro/month in hungary i wish . 
  the average wage is [ 500 $ ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage ) here , over 75 % less than the german and austrian average . 
  only local goods and services are cheaper . 
  imports and luxuries , - cars , household electronics , computers - cost the same , if not more . 
  local goods and services are proportionally cheaper , however import goods and luxuries are not . 
  a smartphone , a car or a washing machine will cost the same . 
  looking at the chart you linked , the average * disposable * salary after taxes in denmark is 19600 kr , while 3600 kr in hungary . 
  even with the cheaper cost of living in hungary , the danish counterpart will have over five times more money left to spend on luxuries . 
   where is the best place in the world to be a working woman ? 
  clearly hungarian and polish women , scoring 6th and 4th place on the chart , have it so much better than 4th from the bottom switzerland , where disposable income is four times higher . 
  what the guardian article fails to mention is the antecedent to that decision , that is [ thousands of migrants started marching towards austria on a busy motorway ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/thousands-refugees-begin-walking-along-6382515 ) , fed up with [ hungary 's persistence to keep them there ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/01/migrant-crisis-hungary-closes-main-budapest-station ) in accordance to regulations . 
  hell , * austria 's chancellor * , faymann , [ compared the hungarian government to nazis ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/austrian-chancellor-compares-hungarys-refugee-policies-to-nazi-deportations-2015-9 ) for stopping a train full of migrants heading to * austria * . 
  every involved country , * except * hungary tried to push the issue on others . 
  croatia , slovenia , austria let migrants through without resistance , germany spearheaded the effort to push refugees on other eu members . 
  hungary was the only country that did n't just try to stop illegal migrants trespassing through the country , but actually succeeded in it . 
  germany had about as much say in taking in the migrants as hungary . 
  the reason they were accumulated in hungary , as opposed to , say , in slovenia after the flow was diverted , is because we made an effort at enforcing the dublin and schengen regulations , keeping the migrants from moving further in the eu . 
  it 's [ well documented ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/01/migrant-crisis-hungary-closes-main-budapest-station ) , we got plenty of [ bad press ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34142512 ) for it , - hell , austria 's chancellor [ likened us to nazis ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/austrian-chancellor-compares-hungarys-refugee-policies-to-nazi-deportations-2015-9 ) for stopping a train full of migrants heading to austria . 
  of course , you can only do so much to hold back an uncooperative mass of people . 
  eventually migrants started to move on on foot , [ walking in groups of thousands on motorways ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/thousands-refugees-begin-walking-along-6382515 ) , endangering motorists and themselves . 
  that was the point where hungary started to [ bus migrants ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/hungary-announces-buses-to-be-sent-for-migrants-walking-towards-austria/a-18695049 ) near the austrian border , and not in response to any policy change by austria , germany or the eu . 
  it was only then , when they had no choice , that austria and germany `` allowed '' migrants to continue their journey . 
  just for reference , [ these scenes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsly4b05twq ) from macedonia show what it looks like when you try to stop a mob of that magnitude without any sort of physical barrier . 
  in fact , merkel 's spokesman , steffen seibert , [ made ] ( http://www.haon.hu/hungary-must-enforce-asylum-regulations-says-german-govt-spokesman/2910195 ) [ it ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/hungary-closes-budapest-railway-station-6360538 ) [ clear ] ( http://in.reuters.com/article/europe-migrants-germany-idinkcn0r00yx20150831 ) that member countries ( including hungary ) are still obligated to enforce asylum regulations , - migrants have to be registered in the country where they enter the eu . 
  what made a difference for hungary was physically stopping the influx . 
  the day the fence was completed and border control enforced , the number of illegal entries to hungary [ dropped from 4-9000 a day to 20-40 ] ( http://police.hu/hirek-es-informaciok/hatarinfo/elfogott-migransok-szama-lekerdezes?honap%5bvalue%5d%5byear%5d=2015&amp;honap%5bvalue%5d%5bmonth%5d=10 ) and remained so ever since . 
   orban 's fidesz became the hungarian government in 2006 . 
  correction : the hungarian socialist party , mszp was elected in 2006 . 
  fidesz came to governance in 2010 with a supermajority . 
   ** hungary ** [ ... ] i 'd expect him to end up being a lynchpin in some alliance in a large war soon , whether he wants to or not . 
  hungarian history in a nutshell . 
  fun fact : german companies were [ refusing to sell ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/german-companies-refuse-to-sell-razor-wire-for-hungarys-anti-refugee-fence-a6668296.html ) razorwire to hungary , sabotaging the effort to protect the schengen borders . 
  we ended up importing from china . 
  the problem would n't exist if western countries did n't destabilize the middle east , bomb those countries to the ground , then support ~ ~ terrorists ~ ~ moderate rebels to fight over the rubble . 
  considering how well the relocation is going , i do n't think we need to worry , even if the ec challenge fails . 
  as of november , less than 150 * asylum seekers were relocated out of the 160000 to be moved . 
  by the same date , germany only prepared to take in 10 ( ten ) * refugees through the relocation plan , out of the over 27000 they pledged to . 
  on an eu level , only a capacity of a little over 3500 was prepared , 1302 of that in bulgaria , who alone fulfilled their pledge . 
  even if the relocations went as planned , lacking a viable mechanism to keep the migrants in their destined countries , likely they 'll all end up in germany and sweden anyway . 
  * according to [ politico article ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/5-reasons-relocating-refugees-is-a-nightmare-migration-crisis-malta-summit/#supercomments ), 
  800000 is the lowest estimate , as mentioned in your source . 
  as for the third source , obviously it 's not going to be a million , as you mention it yourself that figure is for the first time applicants in that three months . 
  also keep in mind that only a fraction take advantage of the refugee system , [ most of them integrate and seek employment as soon as they can ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/13/ukraines-refugees-find-solace-in-poland-europes-most-homogenous-society ) , unlike the syrians . 
  that 's the advantage when you do n't `` flee '' half a continent away through several safe countries , and instead take refuge in geographically and culturally close nations . 
  and again , you are doing us no favors by taking in masses of immigrants from half a world away . 
  in fact , thanks to this insane policy the transit countries are completely overwhelmed . 
  instead of support , what we got is demonisation for trying to protect our and schengen 's borders . 
  as for russia , it seems like the eu `` helps '' us whether we like it or not . 
  torpedoing the south stream plans , and just last week the paks ii nps deal , that is meant to replace our old nuclear power station , paks i , which provides over 40 % of our electricity . 
  i guess now you can `` help '' us more selling * your * gas and electricity instead . 
  meanwhile germany happily buys russian gas through nord stream , even planning to build another pipeline . 
  hell , your former chancellor is head of the shareholders committee of nord stream ag , nominated by gazprom for his efforts ( i guess solidarity really is a two way street ) . 
  i hope these generous states do n't brake their arm while petting themselves on the back so hard . 
  eastern europe is already [ hosting close to a million ukrainian refugees ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/2015/07/ukraine-worlds-unseen-refugee-crisis-150720082647225.html ) , but unlike some western european countries , we 're not trying to dump them on the rest of the eu . 
  you are doing us no favors by taking in middle eastern immigrants en masse . 
  i like how ` looking foolish ' is emphasized with big bold letters , while the fact that the suspects are still under criminal investigation for the possession of bomb making equipment is delegated to the last sentence . 
  that is brilliant , thank you !, 
  i 've got some reading to do . 
  my point is , simply put , that certain decisions , that are especially sensitive to a nation 's sovereignty , should n't be decided using the qmv framework but instead , as it is in the case of accession to schengen , be decided unanimously . 
  i 'm not suggesting that we return unanimity as the standard procedure , only that qmv is not apropiate in every case . 
  i 'm skimming through the lisbon treaty , but i do n't see what you mean . 
  could you cite the title/article ? 
  i do n't mean it in an argumentative manner , i 'd genuinely like to know if it 's so . 
  is it specific , as in , concerning movement of people , handling of refugees , or in some other manner ? 
  thank you in advance . 
  citizens have accepted to concede * some * authority to to eu . 
  member states are still sovereign entities . 
  you are also contradicting yourself . 
  if the eu ca n't enforce decisions than it has no authority . 
  it has already been suggested that the structural fund should be used as punitive measure against those who are against the quota . 
  of course the v4 could defy the decision or even leave the eu and take the hit , but to call that freedom would be , as you said , petty rhetoric . 
  while the lisbon treaty replaced unanimity with qmv as the * standard * voting procedure , it did not replace unanimity as a whole . 
  a decision so essential to a country 's sovereignty , such as who a country allows within her borders or not , should and is decided with unanimity . 
  see the schengen agreement , where every time the group of signatories is expanded , consent is required of both old and new signatories .
