  as a matter of fact , germany ( and a select other members ) used their veto rights to deny acceptance of romania and bulgaria to the schengen area , on account of their lacking border control , of all things . 
  using qmv in this case is precedent setting , and i hope the ecj strikes it down . 
  and may i just say , it takes a special brand of arrogance to not just assume the right to meddle in a foreign countries internal affairs as natural , but to scoff and groan as her citizens and leaders express their displeasure . 
  the reason the fence is only funneling migrants through other countries is not because hungary is protecting her borders but because other schengen countries are not . 
  no , i do n't think we should make every decision completely by ourselves . 
  but in a question like settling thousands if not tens of thousands of people in our country i think it 's quite natural that we should have the final word . 
  the eu should make recommendations on how many a given country should take , but ultimately it should be up to the given country how many if any refugees will be redistributed there . 
  think about how the sovereignty of countries regarding movement of people is respected in the framework of the schengen agreement . 
  every time schengen is expanded , consent is required from the new acceptee and * every * member state , not just the majority . 
  for example , the acceptance of romania and bulgaria in the schengen zone is being postponed because [ germany ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/germany-blocks-schengen-membership-for-bulgaria-romania/a-16656037 ) and a select few other member countries veto the decision . 
  your veto can not be overruled , not by a majority , not by a qualified majority . 
  the same principle should apply in the forced redistribution of refugees . 
   why can i no texpect every single county to take a share of the refugees according to their population and gdp ? 
  because we are sovereign countries , not fiefs of germany . 
   such an initiative or lack thereof has no influence on whether france has a point here about russia . 
  that 's literally what i pointed out  whataboutism would be using the assertion , that the us is also guilty of misconduct , - yet not investigated , - to argue that russia 's misconduct should also be indulged . 
  with the addition that  mcakkeezz did n't make that argument . 
  and neither do i. i have zero issues with france asking to investigate russia 's action for war crimes . 
  the point of my post was pointing out the misuse of the term `` whataboutism '' . 
  if you read what you linked , the form of the tu quoque fallacy is : * person a makes claim x. 
  * person b asserts that a 's actions or past claims are inconsistent with the truth of claim x. 
  * therefore x is false . 
  in other words , the fact that the one making the argument is being hypocritical or inconsistent , does n't mean the claim is false . 
  in this case : * france claims russia is committing war crimes , and should be investigated * mcakkeezz points out that the us should also be investigated ( only investigating russia is inconsistent on france 's part ) * therefore , russia should not be investigated - ** is an argument mcakkeezz did n't make ** simply pointing out hypocrisy or inconsistency is not a logical fallacy . 
  the accusations in this thread of tu quoque and whataboutism are mistaken and misleading . 
  holding both involved parties to the same standard is not whatabautism . 
  whataboutism would be using the assertion , that the us is also guilty of misconduct , - yet not investigated , - to argue that russia 's misconduct should also be indulged . 
  mcakkeezz did n't make that argument . 
  i would . 
  greece , for example , only requires a minimum property investment of 250,000 $ , the property does n't need to be residential , and you can make a joint investment . 
  greece has no minimum stay requirement either . 
  in hungary , on top of the 300,000 $ you also need to pay ~ 60,000 $ in gov. 
  fees , non refundable . 
  the article mentions that the hungarian bond carries no risk , which in a sense is true , it is a guaranteed loss through five years of inflation . 
  meanwhile housing prices in most eu countries are rising , and the property investment could very well grant a positive return . 
  of course none of this is really relevant , every country has some sort of residency application and naturalization program , the only benefit here is the faster processing time . 
  applicants still go through all the important bureaucratic steps , like criminal background checks . 
  what it is indeed not comparable to , is masses of people literally just walking through the borders unchecked , which is what the article [ means to imply ] ( http://g8fip1kplyr33r3krz5b97d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/politico_illustration_hungary_cmyk-380x532.jpg ) . 
  blatantly misleading title . 
  the immigration mentioned in the article is lawful , regulated , orderly and the naturalization process takes several years ( 5 + ) . 
  this permanent residency for investment , - with possible naturalization , - scheme is not a hungarian curiosity either , it is practiced by a wide selection of eu countries . 
  some of the [ more popular ] ( http://www.goldenvisas.com/category/investor-visa/citizenship/ ) programs are ran by spain , portugal , cyprus , greece and malta . 
  this is in no way related to the balkan front mass migration , - as the title means to imply , - that involves illegal border crossing and the mass movement of unvetted people or the asylum system . 
  this is in no sense a `` hole in the schengen fence '' . 
  as usual , when reporting on the eastern half of the eu , journalistic integrity is not required . 
  we saw this with the absurd fabricated story by sky news about weapons smuggling , we saw this during the reporting of the entire 2015 migrant crisis and we are seeing it ever since , in articles such as this . 
   but not criminal , though . 
  the first video , probably not . 
  but going back to your original comment , i think it 's plenty negative of an experience . 
  illegal border crossers protesting in a foreign country to get their way , blocking a major railway station , occasionally throwing rocks , shoes or whatever 's at hand , even [ throwing away donated food ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srhi0xqv5rc ) is deplorable , yes . 
  uh-huh . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpxqf90eili ) and [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lehbv6o71we ) is how they were behaving while they were held up for only a couple weeks , never mind a permanent camp , like calais . 
  for reference , [ this ] ( http://www.budapestinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/keleti-refugees.jpg ) is how the keleti station , one of hungary 's major transport hub , and its [ surroundings ] ( http://i2.nyt.com/images/2015/09/02/world/02migrants-2/02migrants-2-jumbo.jpg ) looked like during last year 's crisis . 
  we could 've had our own `` calais '' , only in the middle of our own capital . 
  so much positive experience we 're missing out on . 
  naturalization is not an automatic process , and requires , among other things , fluency in hungarian . 
  besides , many other eu countries have similar investment for residency schemes , with potential naturalization after a set amount of years . 
  permanent residency , not citizenship . 
  many countries in the eu and outside have some sort of residency for investment scheme . 
  [ here 's a list ] ( http://business-investor-immigration.com/ ) of the more popular ones . 
  the bond is for permanent residency , not citizenship . 
  canada ended the program reasoning it provided insufficient economic benefit , not because the quality of the vetting , as per your quote and article . 
  besides , it should be intuitive , that a country with higher cost of running businesses ( higher local wages , etc ) would set a higher monetary requirement for business immigration . 
  if you look at the average wage difference between hungary and canada , a difference of ~ [ 2.35 x ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_average_wage ) , the canadian requirement for investment is in fact what you would expect given the wage gap , if not less ( 300k $ * 2.35 ~ = 1035 cad ), 
  300000 $ is over 40 years worth of hungarian ( net ) median income . 
  even on the median income of the richer eu countries it would take over half a decade to earn that much . 
  someone who can muster 300k $ , not to mention giving it up for 5 years without interest , is rich by any reasonable and relevant standard . 
  not everyone is born with a silver spoon in their mouth . 
   all i know is , we never point at them , ever you literally just called out the auditor for being  a hungarian `` person '' . 
  a wide variety of cargo , like rolls of paper or sheet metal , pallet tanks , etc. 
  would be impossible to move without a forklift or a crane . 
  some cargo might be impractical to move covertly due to their size , like furniture . 
  other type might not be worth much per unit , like empty bottles or flower pots . 
  not necessarily . 
  as long as he stays within the eea and a select non eea countries ( i.e. 
  most of europe and some countries outside of europe ) , he can use his swiss identity card as a travel document . 
  the same is true for all eea member citizens that issue eea standard national identity cards ( all members except uk , iceland , denmark and norway ) . 
  that does n't make sense in this context . 
  the sentence you quoted is not an argument , it 's an assertion . 
  there is no pair of premise and conclusion from where a logical connection could be missing . 
  the sentence simply asserts , as long as a is true , he will do b. 
   the first false assumption here is that the national assembly is a supreme decision making body that have to have a say in everything that has to do with hungary , even if it 's an eu matter like this . 
  that 's clearly not the case . 
  the question contains no such supposition . 
  it does n't assume that the national assembly is a supreme decision making body on every issue to do with hungary . 
  it does n't even assume that the eu should n't be able to override the national assembly on the question of the proposed resettlement , - that is in fact the very topic of the question , that is what is called into question . 
  furthermore , the referendum also does not declare or limit the form of resistance to be plain defiance . 
  as you said there are established channels to seek recourse , bureaucratic and political tools to stop this and further resettlement proposals from coming to life or reach their effect . 
   this is very clearly not happening , i have n't seen a single piece of news about quotas since winter that did n't came from orban-like populist politicians , doing the same don quixote-like farce of a fight against a non-existing enemy that he does . 
  i 'm just puzzled how you can say that , when there 's a [ thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4x263r/senior_german_meps_threaten_to_cut_eu_money_to/ ) right alongside this one about senior german meps pushing to punish hungary and poland for resisting the quota , posted by you no less . 
  besides , even if news organizations got bored of the topic , the migrants that so far arrived have gone nowhere , and new ones keep coming through the gaping hole our schengen neighbors left wide open . 
  this is a live issue , especially now , that turkey is pivoting away from europe and making any deal untenable by using the migrant issue to blackmail the eu . 
   how is this question not loaded ? 
  it clearly has a `` right '' and a `` wrong '' answer . 
  that is not at all what a loaded question is . 
  a loaded question relies on a false or disputed supposition . 
  the question here is clear and factual . 
  `` do you want the eu to be able to resettle non-hungarian citizens in hungary , without the national assembly 's approval ? '', 
  that is exactly what the eu is proposing , a resettlement at the behest of our national government and the will of the hungarian people . 
  your example , `` do you like it when the state makes you pay taxes ? '',
