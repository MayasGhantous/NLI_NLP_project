  is not at all alike . 
  a similar formulation would be `` do you think the state should have the power to make you pay taxes '' . 
  you might not like the popular answer , you might think the referendum should not be able to decide on that issue , - or the government to act on the results , - you can call the voters clueless for wasting their time , but that does n't make the question loaded . 
  a question having a right and wrong answer definitely does n't make it loaded . 
  serbia , bosnia and montenegro are not eu countries . 
  bulgaria and croatia did n't vote against the quotas . 
  hungary does n't have much of a weapons industry to begin with , and along with poland are not on the list of countries exporting arms to the middle east . 
  you might have a point with the czech republic , slovakia and romania , if only individual western european countries , like germany , did n't have several times larger weapons deals with the middle east by themselves . 
  the german weapons trade alone dwarfs eastern europe 's , at [ 3.5 billion euros ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/weapons-go-to-conflict-zones-the-money-comes-to-germany/a-18798104 ) in 2015 , - of which nearly half , 1.7 billion euros ' worth is with non-eu , non-nato countries like [ saudi arabia ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-arms-exports-iduskcn0wg1bh ) . 
  the road indicated by a white , rear outline of a car on blue background is what you would call an [ express way or limited-access road ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/limited-access_road#europe ) . 
  it has varying names and definitions per country . 
  generally , it is a high speed road that has some , but not all characteristics of a controlled-access highway . 
  it would n't be a representative sample of public opinion if they discarded neutral responses . 
  say you are measuring the public opinion on x. 
  say 60 % of the opinionated section of the sample are for x. 
  that wo n't have the same meaning if 90 % of the public are opinionated ( 54 % of public are for x ) or only 30 % is opinionated ( 18 % of public are for x ) . 
  unlikely , considering our public debt was [ brought in check ] ( https://www.google.hu/publicdata/explore?ds=ds22a34krhq5p_&amp;met_y=gd_pc_gdp&amp;idim=country:hu:cz:ro&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=gd_pc_gdp&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country:hu:el&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) after mszp was ousted in 2010 , and we repaid our 2008 imf loan ahead of schedule . 
  right , the riots were on the first day . 
  reading your last line i thought you were making a general point about the protests . 
  that 's pretty much the current political situation . 
  dk , pm , mlp , egy\u00fctt are all small soc-lib / lib / green parties formed after the 2010 election . 
  they got into parliament in 2014 , along with the former governing party , mszp , another green party , - lmp ( founded in 2009 ) and of course jobbik . 
  yeah , no . 
  there were 10 000 + demonstrations in budapest [ for over a week ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_protests_in_hungary ) , peaking at 40 - 50 000 on more than one day . 
  there were also protests several thousands strong in the following years . 
  if it 's about corruption , why not include the 2/3 of the eu , like italy , romania , greece , spain or portugal , who are doing about [ as well or worse ] ( http://www.transparency.org/cpi2015 ) corruption wise as poland or hungary ? 
  but it 's not about corruption , is it ? 
  hyped up ? 
  you do realize hungary was handling more asylum applications per ( local ) capita in 2015 [ than any other eu country in 2015 ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34131911 ) , right ? 
  we had [ 4-8000 illegal entries * per day * ] ( http://police.hu/hirek-es-informaciok/hatarinfo/elfogott-migransok-szama-lekerdezes?honap%5bvalue%5d%5byear%5d=2015&amp;honap%5bvalue%5d%5bmonth%5d=10 ) before the fence was completed . 
  i 'm not an expert on lgbt issues , but i would say not recognizing same sex marriage , like in poland , versus punishing homosexuality with up to 3 years in prison , like in syria ( or death penalty in isis held territories ) is sufficiently different to be of concern . 
  which is , at best , a notch above the banter you say you disrespect . 
  certainly not civil discourse . 
  then perhaps that 's the point you should 've made in the first place , instead of mischaracterizing what is being said . 
  you yourself are making comments like this in this very thread :  [ dae thinks real science only = le stem masterrace , gaise ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/63r4aw/hungarys_antisoros_education_law_sparks_schism_in/dfwjjw2/ ), 
  that 's a rather disingenuous characterization of the argument made in the article . 
  the writer did n't just state his dislike of the methodology as you imply , but goes in detail what he thinks is wrong with the criteria of the listing and why he thinks it 's wrong . 
  he also provides an example of what would be a better system and why ( e.g. 
  more weight on quantity and quality of research instead on number of foreign students ) . 
  all this while your own post is scantly an argument , and relies on innuendo instead . 
  yep , those are some of the programs and courses . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.ceu.edu/academics/degrees/masters ) 's the list of the master 's degree programs ceu is offering . 
  the linked graph tells a different story . 
  it shows trust in national democracy slowly recovering , while trust in the eu steadily declining . 
  the last data point shows only five pp difference between trust in national democracy and eu democracy , only the trend of the former points up , while the other down . 
  the sharp drop in trust for national democracy in 2006 happened as the eu friendly hungarian socialist party came to power . 
  trust started recovering since they were ousted , and fidesz was voted in . 
  was n't may against brexit ? 
  i do n't think this is a fair characterization . 
  if anything , i would describe executing the will of the people despite her personal opinions as laudable . 
  actually you 're right , ng is not liquefiable at room temperature , as it 's critical temperature is well below that ( ~ -80 \u00b0 c ) , - i got mixed up there . 
  it 's the same all around the world . 
  besides , another [ article ] ( https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article158262466/erster-wasserstoff-zug-der-welt-faehrt-in-deutschland.html ) ( posted by u/vegaiv below ) details the source of the hydrogen , - it 's not renewables . 
  the hydrogen used in this project is industrial byproduct as i predicted . 
  oh , absolutely . 
  however if you invested in a hydrogen powered vehicle you will want some return from it , and this is the cheapest source of bulk hydrogen on the market . 
  most hydrogen is produced for industrial use today . 
  hydrogen from reformed methane is very much usable in fuel cells . 
  in fact some of the hydrogen fuel cell technologies include on board reforming to eliminate the problems associated with storing hydrogen . 
  nope . 
  here 's a 2016 [ paper ] ( https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2016/07/f33/fcto_hydrogen_production_fs.pdf ) from the fuel cell technologies office of the us energy department on hydrogen production . 
  95 % of the current h2 production is done by steam reforming , the other 5 % from other petrochemical industries and the coal industry . 
  renewables are not used exactly because it does n't make economical sense , as the paper states . 
  sources such as electrolysis powered by solar or wind are only mentioned in the long term , and even then one of the largest source is predicted to be coal gasification . 
  this is from the department that is actually researching and pushing for this technology . 
  industrial scale hydrogen production is mostly done by steam reforming . 
  it involves reacting water vapor with methane at high temperatures ( ~ 1000 \u00b0 c ) which produce hydrogen and carbon-dioxide . 
  hydrogen is also produced as byproducts of other petrochemical processes . 
  the map is from a [ huffington post article ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/thrillist/what-every-country-in-the_b_6532054.html ) . 
  by illegal spending they mean spending on undeclared goods and services , citing this [ eurobarometer paper ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_402_en.pdf ) . 
  this upsets the self hating hungarians . 
  clearly fidesz has bought huffington post , that seems to be the [ source ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/thrillist/what-every-country-in-the_b_6532054.html ) of this map . 
  the cited [ eurobarometer paper ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_402_en.pdf ) is about undeclared work ( i.e. 
  tax dodging ) . 
  according to the table on page 29. , showing median spending on undeclared work ( goods and services ) , hungarians spend the least by a good margin , - even less than countries with a lower median wage . 
   but i suppose nuance and getting all sides of a story is not something a person who picks the username veryhighenergy cares much for . 
  your entire post is a strawman about a story no one here mentioned , and you 're the one to call for `` nuance '' and `` getting all sides of a story '' ? 
  perhaps they are thinking of the fact that the [ overwhelming majority ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-overview/ ) of muslims around the world support the implementation of islamic law . 
  over 2/3 of muslims is a hell of a fringe group . 
  that 's a straight up lie . 
  the very reason the migrants were stuck in budapest , is because they were n't allowed on the trains heading for austria and germany . 
  in fact , when migrants forced themselves on a train they mistakenly thought was going to germany , it was western media and politicians that [ complained ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/aa4485c8-5211-11e5-8642-453585f2cfcd ) , or * bitched * , that they were n't let through . 
  in fact , austria 's chancellor [ likened ] ( http://www.independent.ie/incoming/austria-likens-hungary-migrant-treatment-to-nazis-sending-jews-to-concentration-camps-31522055.html ) hungary to nazi germany for halting the train boarded by migrants . 
  and let 's not pretend that hungary was alone in being unable to hold back the flood , - from germany , a good portion of the migrants went on to denmark and sweden . 
  no country in the path of the migrant wave managed to stop them , not without a [ physical border fence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_border_barrier#impact_on_the_number_of_illegal_migrants_entering_hungary ) , that is . 
  of course the fence could 've been completed faster too , if german companies did n't [ refuse to sell razorwire to hungary ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/german-companies-refuse-to-sell-razor-wire-for-hungarys-anti-refugee-fence-a6668296.html ) , effectively sabotaging the effort to protect the schengen borders . 
  and why should they ? 
  the fact is , both countries are currently in the eu , and to change that , these parties have to work in the current framework , which involves getting eu funds . 
  is it though ? 
  is there an actual source of le pen or someone in fn claiming this as their rationale of taking eu money ? 
  or is this just the sort of straw man that then fellow redditors can circlejerk around about how dumb fn is , like i 've seen in previous fn threads . 
  at some point in time daring alchemists were trying to turn led to gold , hoping to get rich . 
  it did n't happen then , not happening today . 
  even though it 's technically possible to do in a laboratory today ( not from lead , but mercury , i think ) the process is cost prohibitive . 
  so is the kind of storage you are proposing . 
  nevertheless , if you have knowledge of this magical energy storage device , i 'd love to know about it . 
  if you have not , however , i see no point in this conversation , as we are discussing fiction . 
  how about you find me a real world case of grid scale storage capable of replacing load following production that is not hydro . 
  never mind replacing dispatchable production as a whole , as you state , which would be completely bonkers .
