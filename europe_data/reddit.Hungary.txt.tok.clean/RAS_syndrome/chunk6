  the best you will find is some experimental cases of huge , insanely expensive for their performance , football field sized chemical battery clusters , that can supply a city for a couple minutes at most , - used for load smoothing , not load following . 
  these are not even near the order of magnitude required to replace day - night cycle load following . 
  but let me help you , you could start the search [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/talk:grid_energy_storage ) . 
  do n't be dissuaded by the first paragraph clearly stating that  by far the largest form of grid energy storage on grids is dammed hydroelectricity or that  world pumped storage generating capacity was 104 gw , ( ... ) which comprises the vast majority of all types of grid electric storage - ** all other types combined are some hundreds of mw ** emphasis mine . 
  here 's a hint : a small city of 100 000 uses on the order of magnitude north of 100 mw of electricity . 
  and i seriously hope you do n't think electric power sold under price or even at a negative price is somehow `` free '' . 
  the cost of operating equipment , the cost of fuel , etc. 
  is the same when the power company sells the electricity at the predicted price or when they have to pay consumers to use more . 
  at the end of the day , someone still has to pay for that , in the case of public power companies , that 's the taxpayers . 
  the ones who benefit from the underpriced energy , the ones who are in effect subsidized by this are the biggest industrial electricity consumers . 
   it is . 
  supply is plentiful , and that 's what we 're after , are n't we ? 
  surplus generation creates waste and degrades infrastructure unnecessarily . 
  more power is not more better . 
  the ideal amount of power generation is the amount used at a given moment . 
   a storage company can ... that scale of ( economical ) electrical energy storage is fantasy . 
  the only real contender is pumped hydro , but that 's limited by the availability of the necessary geological features . 
  you do realize what you are describing is not a positive , right ? 
  when electricity prices fall through the floor , even into negatives , as you described , is not a sign of power companies doing good . 
  it 's because they overproduced and have to sell electricity at a loss , or even pay consumers and neighboring grid operators to pick up the slack , to keep the grid stable . 
  this is the result of the fact that wind energy is not dispatchable . 
  the other side of this coin is , of course , that other times wind underperforms and again other forms of production have to pick up the slack . 
   i am not surprised by the actions of the parties , but more that there are still people out there , who look at these situations and go `` yeah , no , these people are good nationals and stand by my values ! '', 
  why would the supporters of these parties object to using eu funding to fight the eu ? 
  why would they * not * take the money the eu gives them ? 
  what better way to fight against what they ` hate ' than using its own resources and institutions against itself ? 
  the [ interior ] ( http://www.szeretlekmagyarorszag.hu/az-orszag-haza-belulrol/ ) of the parliament is also worth a look . 
  n\u00e9bih made their conclusions based on the entirety of their study , you are cherry-picking . 
  you are clearly coming to this discussion with a chip on your shoulder . 
  this is not about orb\u00e1n or soros , and it is not specifically about hungary either . 
  similar studies in other central and eastern european countries have come to the same conclusion as n\u00e9bih , - in fact there 's a bulgarian report linked in just below . 
  you are allowing your disdain towards a political faction ( and towards persons you deem to belong there ) to get the better of you . 
   okay love , brussels is out to get us then . 
  all evidence to the contrary is soros-propaganda . 
  they must be stopped . 
  case in point . 
   you are making it sound like it were the hungarian products with the consistently lower quality , which is not true except that 's exactly the conclusion n\u00e9bih came to , here 's [ their interpretation ] ( http://portal.nebih.gov.hu/documents/10182/323140/term%c3%a9k-%c3%b6sszehasonl%c3%adt%c3%a1s_%c3%b6sszefoglalo%cc%81.pdf/7904db41-407d-42a5-81ac-25cc39a08811 ) of the results . 
  you are trying very hard to misrepresent this study . 
  `` pretty unconvincing '' was the conclusion of the newspaper , not the study . 
  the n\u00e9bih ( food safety office ) results confirmed exactly the kind of discrepancies that are complained about , - less fish in fish sticks , lower quality ( mixed ) olive oil instead of extra virgin , differences in consistency , etc. 
  clear evidence that certain products are different . 
  or , you know , since we do n't live in an anarcho-capitalist society , we could enforce fair practices through legislation . 
  at the very least , different quality products should be labeled differently . 
  that does n't work when the different quality products are labeled the same , and the alternative is not even presented to the consumer . 
  neither the western , nor the eastern members of the eu should be served second grade products . 
  the fact that a handful of products are worse quality in austria is more reason to address this issue , not less . 
  as for the prices , i checked the first 32 , exactly half of them were more expensive in austria , the other half in hungary . 
  i 'm guessing you missed that the quantity of the products per package is different in some of the comparisons . 
  looking at n\u00c9bih 's ( food safety office ) [ 2017 report ] ( http://portal.nebih.gov.hu/documents/10182/323140/term%c3%a9k-%c3%b6sszehasonl%c3%adt%c3%a1s_%c3%b6sszefoglalo%cc%81.pdf/7904db41-407d-42a5-81ac-25cc39a08811 ) : 20 out of the 84 had no directly comparable hungarian counterpart ( category iii in the report ) 25 had matching brand and looks , but different composition ( cat . 
  ii ) * different quality ingredients , the same nutrition values were ensured artificially by additives * same recipe , but lower quality substitute ingredients ( ex . 
  hekk filet instead of alaskan salmon , malt aroma instead of barley malt ) * ingredients in different quantity in the product ( ex . 
  palm based grease second highest quantity ingredient in soup cube meant for hungary , fourth in the product meant for foreign market ) * products made in the * same factory * had quantitatively different ingredients when meant for hungarian market ( ex . 
  fish stick meant for hungary are thinner , so much so , that the product with the same number of fish sticks has an entire fish stick 's worth less fish in it ) 51 had matching brand , looks and composition ( cat . 
  i ) but even among these there are differences in ingredient quality : * ingredients with different origin ( ex instead of extra virgin olive oil , they use mixed olive oil ) * different levels of processing of ingredients ( ex . 
  the used fruit puree is deseeded for foreign market , but not for hungary ) * confectionery products have a difference in color , suggesting different quality ( darker colored chocolate suggest higher quality cacao used in foreign product ) * different quality suggested by ingredients or nutritional values marked on the packaging * possible differences from technology used in manufacturing ( ex . 
  different coffee roasting method ) an earlier , [ 2014 report ] ( http://portal.nebih.gov.hu/-/a-hazai-es-kulfoldi-elelmiszerek-vizsgalati-tapasztalatairol-2014-ev-vegi-vizsgalat - ) has already confirmed differences like different consistency of nutella , less fish in rio mare tuna fish , knorr products had different ingredients , their meatballs had a net weight of 48 g in hungary vs 60 g and a host of other discrepancies . 
  do n't know why this is downvoted , - the last time germany tried to ban the practice the conference of european rabbis labeled the ban the '' [ worst attack on jewish life since the holocaust ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/european-jewish-leaders-lambast-german-circumcision-ruling-a-844128.html ) '' . 
  according to the leader of the group , pinchas goldschmidt , this is `` an existential question for the jewish community in germany '' and if the ban were to pass , `` then i do n't see a future for jews in germany . '', 
  i wish someone had the spine to push it through , religious rights should not trump the right to bodily integrity , especially that of a child . 
  leave body altering religious markings to adulthood . 
  i invite you to look at a map of europe , and explain to me how migrants reach hungary without passing through another eu country . 
  let me help you , [ here 's a map of the dublin signatories ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dublin_regulation#/media/file:dublin_regulation.svg ) . 
  following dublin iii , the frontier countries for the balkan migrant wave are greece and bulgaria . 
  hungary is almost perfectly `` dublin-locked '' . 
  as for the `` monopolized media landscape '' , the most watched tv channel in hungary by a long shot is the [ german owned rtl klub ] ( http://index.hu/kultur/media/2017/03/13/hajdu_peter_megint_megverte_a_tv2-t/ ) . 
  among internet news sites , the government friendly origo is not much ahead of other , staunchly anti-gov news portals ( [ views/day origo : 570 000 index : 492 072 ] ( http://ite.hu/legnezettebb-hazai-weboldalak-rangsora/ ) ) , the anti gov. 
  index actually has a better alexa rank ( no . 
  1 in hungary )  if the norther european countries did n't listen to the latest calls from the un high commissioner not to send the migrants to back to hungary and actually did so , the borders would be locked behind the country and mr orban would have to deal with maybe a 100 ' 000 migrants . 
  northern european countries and the un high commissioner can make whatever decisions they want , does n't change the fact that they have neither the legal ground ( as shown above ) , nor the physical means to stop and send those people back to hungary . 
  for the record , [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hk6dtbwc_s ) is what it looks like when you try to stop thousands of migrants with a police force not aided by a physical barrier . 
  that `` decision '' was more political posturing than an actual choice . 
  of course let 's not forget to talk about the redistribution quota itself . 
  while hungary and the v4 is often and loudly condemned for not wanting to participate in the quota , what is not so loud is the admittance of the ** utter failure of the redistribution scheme ** . 
  the entirety of the eu , including the countries that voted for the redistribution system , [ so far have only reallocated 14,000 people ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-17-218_en.htm ) ( rounding up ) in over two years , out of the 160,000 agreed upon out of the over a million that arrived . 
  the fact is , there is no practical reason for further pursuing this completely ineffective system , the only reason to keep pushing is some perverse display of political dominance . 
  when the border seal was completed the number of illegals entering dropped by [ over 95 % overnight ] ( http://www.police.hu/hirek-es-informaciok/hatarinfo/elfogott-migransok-szama-lekerdezes?honap%5bvalue%5d%5byear%5d=2015&amp;honap%5bvalue%5d%5bmonth%5d=10 ) , not gradually , as migrants started to look for a new route . 
  the number dropped sharply because they could n't get through , and not for a [ lack of trying ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtbfv7meagm ) . 
  the example in my op does n't rely on migrants giving up , it was specifically about migrants who were actively trying to get through . 
  the question is , again : what would the migrants ( who are trying to get through ) do differently , if there was no alternate route , that a fence suddenly would n't slow them down , throttle them , or otherwise hinder them ? 
  what part of my example relies on an alternate route existing ? 
  a group of people slowly climbing through a fence are much easier to apprehend than the same group running through unopposed on a border with no fence . 
  what do you think would change if there was no alternate route , that suddenly a fence would become ineffective in augmenting the border guards ' work ? 
  it really amazes me that to a lot of people fences seem to be some sort of arcane technology that is beyond today 's human reasoning , and it 's effectiveness can only be guessed at based on historical fragments and legend . 
  i would simply ask , which group seems easier to apprehend , [ this ] ( http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&amp;d=20150914&amp;t=2&amp;i=1079294832&amp;w=780&amp;fh=&amp;fw=&amp;ll=&amp;pl=&amp;sq=&amp;r=lynxnpeb8d0ur ) or [ this ] ( https://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/e8/32d0fbdb95cf347583d56a9c3f00ff/media:a3a2f3b4f54c4a1bbfb79bb9ebb5c68dhungaryborderfence.jpeg ) ? 
  the [ experience in hungary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_border_barrier#impact_on_the_number_of_illegal_migrants_entering_hungary ) suggests it 's the latter . 
  the addendum below the article touches on this :  article 7 of the treaty on european union provides a mechanism to enforce eu values . 
  under article 7 ( 1 ) , the council may determine that there is a clear risk of a serious breach of eu values by a member state and is intended to prevent an actual breach by addressing specific ** recommendations to the member state ** in question . 
  this ** can be triggered by one third ** of member states , by parliament or by the commission . 
  the council has to ** adopt a decision by a four-fifths majority ** after having received parliament 's consent which ** also requires a two-thirds majority of the votes cast and an absolute majority of meps ** . 
  emphasis mine . 
  the process becomes increasingly difficult ; triggering article 7.2 , the actual sanctions , would require unanimity . 
  all this will achieve is further alienate the country from the eu and entrench voters in the fidesz camp even more . 
  membership is not ( directly ) threatened , however the [ preparations have begun to trigger article 7 ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20170511ipr74350/fundamental-rights-in-hungary-meps-call-for-triggering-article-7 ) against hungary last week . 
  the tighter laws against asylum-seekers is mentioned in the reasoning . 
  '' [ the european union yesterday ( 16 may ) set a june deadline for poland and hungary to start admitting their share of refugees from overstretched italy and greece or risk sanctions ] ( https://www.euractiv.com/section/central-europe/news/eu-sets-june-deadline-for-poland-hungary-to-take-migrant-share/ ) '', 
  when the commission boldly labels statements from a member state as false in the name of fighting propaganda , i do n't think it 's unreasonable to expect at least an argument or some form of substantiation on their part . 
  i 'm not sure how you concluded from my statement that i 'm being disingenuous ; - talking of which , no , i 'm not expecting an essay . 
   as much as i technically see where you 're coming from it seems you 've avoided the call out of out your blanket statement about all vs. at least the last two points by just reiterated what you 've already stated about the other four . 
  i admit the blanket statement was careless . 
  * only * four out of the six `` refutations '' does n't even bother addressing the points being made .
