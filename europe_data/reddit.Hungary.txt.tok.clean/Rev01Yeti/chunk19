   you and all your family are economic migrants . 
  according to the lovely pro-migranten people , we ca n't afford to select out real refugees somewhere farther from germany because _ their lives are in great misery and their rights are constantly violated _ and thus we need to just accept all migrants as they come , figure out who is who , and then try to deport them back if they are n't legit refugees . 
  the hard part is the figuring out and the deporting , and we even have to feed them and pay them pocket money even then !, 
  ( and if they get deported ? 
  they can try coming again for some pocket money ! ), 
  funny , i hanve n't seen that in any un charter or convention , but maybe i missed the `` right to march to and live in germany without hindrances '' sections . 
  why would we need to help people from country a to travel unchecked to country b if that 's their wish ? 
  the only reason we tried letting them in and register them was that we had obligations and we were sure called upon them . 
  `` anyone can go to germany , but no one to hungary . '', 
  well , hungary is not a corridor for anyone who decides to march through it . 
  sounds sane , yeah . 
  except they were _ already _ in the country by the time the situation got more serious , we either piss them off and harm their human rights , or we let them go through . 
  we kept out the rest though afterwards , and we still try doing that . 
  no contradiction . 
  because ? 
  not writing homosexual marriage in a constitution makes you have a declared program of `` homophobia '' ? 
   western women are more informed on what counts are assault and coercion , are more likely to call it out and report it . 
  you mean stuff like one simple touch on the shoulder and things like that . 
  oh if people would care about _ my _ rights that much ... 
  yet i do n't complain if people of the opposite gender happen to look at me for longer and similar `` assaulty '' things . 
  irregardless if he cares or not about women or homosexuals , one person ca n't change all people 's mindset no matter how hard he would try . 
  of course we can fuck around and compare hungary to the _ `` absolutely super bestest liberal '' _ countries on earth and say that as long as we are n't there , politicians have no morals here . 
   it 's about being good enough i 'm afraid the world wo n't be ever a `` good enough '' place for _ all _ individuals existing . 
  ideals are nice and noble , but reality disagrees , and complaining about a region which has the best statistics when it comes to protecting individual rights ( and feels ) , is pointless . 
   spent their entire political career legislating against them and making their lives more difficult because hungary is not ultraliberal sweden ? 
  do you say orb\u00e1n has a personal agenda _ against _ women and homosexual just because he happen to have a worldview not unlike say , sweden 's governing party ? 
  so a country is either on par with `` enlightened '' germany or sweden in moral questions or is a lost cause . 
  thank god for moral relativism , and more so for cultural relativism . 
   who determines what is best ? 
  those who call themselves liberals , who else really ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  the fact that fidesz made marriage 's definition heterosexual in our new constitution ? 
  that 's a far shot in this theoretical comparison . 
  meanwhile we have prides every year , homosexuals have a quite worse treatment in certain other countries . 
  seriously every media outlet remotely related to socialism , liberalism , federalism , or being pro-eu have to use at least one `` refugee kid '' in articles about the crisis ? 
  it 's not like we do n't get that there are some kids and women too among the young men . 
  i was curious to see why we had apcs at the r\u00f6szke border crossing last september , it ultimately turned out they were n't used for even being walls . 
  probably for the scare value though . 
  the sad thing is that a bunch of people openly welcomed people who , in general ( at least because we ca n't know for sure who needs it ) , need to be `` told '' what not to do in the country of choice they imagine as their safe haven . 
  appreciated !, 
  that might be true , still , many weu countries are still on dvb-t still . 
  where the fuck do you live ? 
  as much as i hate to admit , but hungary has starving people too . 
  credible sources ? 
  you probably ca n't read hungarian , but these are from a quick google search : http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20141128-telen-tobb-tizezer-gyerek-ehezik.html ( origo , mainstream news web portal ) http://hvg.hu/gazdasag/20140602_a_magyar_csaladok_fele_ehezik ( hvg , economy and business magazine ) http://valasz.hu/itthon/ehezo-gyerekek-magyarorszagon-kinek-a-felelossege-111257 ( heti v\u00e1lasz , political and cultural magazine ) ( * \u00c9hez * means starves , * \u00e9hez\u00e9s * means starvation and * \u00e9hez\u0151 * means starver if you wonder . ), 
  a simple search for '' \u00e9hez\u00e9s statisztika '' brings up a bunch of hungarian sources . 
  also : http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2014/04/01/pola-a01.html ( world socialist web site by the international committee of the fourth international ) http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-04-08/more-americans-go-hungry-all-2-european-nations ( zero hedge ) i ca n't comprehend how can you believe that literally nobody starves in the eu ? 
  have you ever been in the hungarian , slovakian , romanian , serbian , macedonian , bulgarian , albanian countryside for example ? 
  what about all the homeless people in the cities ? 
  just because we might be eu members now and have fiber internet in the capitals does n't mean that we are luxembourg with literally no hunger and poverty . 
  might be true , it was only a guess from me though . 
  but seeing it 's a reduplication ( 2 \u00d7 po ) , it seemed like we invented it . 
  as i remember , he used some hungarian words/names for at least one language 's vocabulary . 
  well , the girl i talked to used `` meg\u00e9bredtem '' instead of `` fel\u00e9bredtem '' , at least when she talked about waking up in the middle of the night unintentionally . 
  but accent-wise , it was almost like hearing anyone in budapest . 
  or my ears suck . 
   it 'll sound more like a swarm of angry bees than a word . 
  then you are doing it wrong !, 
  i like * r\u00fckverc * for ( automotive ) reverse . 
  it 's a loss-loss situation whether we pay turkey or not . 
  fuel taxes in the eu because of refugees ? 
  a bunch of eu countries had no role in making the middle east the shithole it is , and now they will be bullied into paying or else they are to be sanctioned and called names because `` european values '' apparenly means that is okay ... 
  people really redefined what is a refuge , right ? 
  so basically germany and sweden fucked themselves ( and half of europe ) over for humanitarian concerns . 
  since there are no limits on asylum seekers marching into europe , and they are entitled to x amount of money , theoretically this means that any number of people can * try * their luck even if they are n't legit refugees , as they do right now . 
  and then germany and sweden is hesitant to use force when deporting those who got denied ... those have to be fed and housed for weeks and months until they get deported . 
  if they obey , and if there is a country accepting them back . 
  money , money , money , all spent . 
  and then germany want other countries in the eu to spend their money for the same reasons that germany believes in . 
  as it looks , germany is in for difficult times for a decade or two , and it 's only natural that other countries do n't want to deal with the same kind of shit , especially since nobody wants to claim asylum in them in the first place . 
   literally nobody in europe or turkey is starving in which reality do you live in ? 
  as if there were literally no homeless or desperately poor ( and thus starving ) people in the eu , especially in the former communist bloc . 
  fleeing a war should n't get you a free pass to housing and food in the eu , many eu citizens ca n't afford that * with their hard earned money * . 
   western liberals would understand unfortunately they wo n't . 
  these dumb eurofederalists and leftist believe that all cultures are equal and equally integrable into europe . 
  got ta love these kind of smug posts from post-communist countries , wehehe . 
  bwahaha , same with digital tv , western europe is still on dvb-t but we introduced dvb-t2 in the first place . 
  thanks to shame culture . 
  yet japan gets all kinds of crap from western thinkers because they have such a shame culture . 
   homogeneous populations my god , you are such a nazi !, 
  why would anybody think homogeneity as something good ?!, 
  tbh the iron curtain still exists ... western europe have little idea of post-communist europe and why we think the way we think . 
  itt : no , these statictics suck , poland is a racist shithole , it is on the way to become a dictatorship , and it 's in eastern europe anyway . 
  gee , keep up polska , do n't listen to the naysayers . 
  v4 forward !, 
  germany : splendid semi-amateur porn stars doing absolutely nasty shit with a smile . 
  forgive me for the unserious answer , i do n't want to start rambling about merkel . 
   they ramped up deportations of denied asylum seekers . 
  except that they wo n't use force to deportate people and it will take months if not years to deny the asylum rights from these people . 
  good job . 
  and yes , if everybody wants specifically germany/sweden , what could other countries do ? 
  convince the migrants that they will have a similar lifestyle that they seek in germany/sweden ? 
  ... well , whatever was this , it certainly gave off that typical eastern european vibe . 
  except with more speedboats . 
   it 's a nightmare to learn dude , no , really , i like to take pride in hungarian as much as the next hungarian guy , but it 's true that we do n't get people interested in hungary and hungarian by telling them that * bro , srsly , this language is hard , trust me , it 's so fucking hard you will cry blood learning it , but good luck though * , no . 
  that 's not the best way to spread interest in something you take pride in . 
   there is no such thing as `` the hardest language '' and as long as someone have the motivation , any language , including hungarian could be learned , even if on a basic level . 
  as a budapester , i talked to two ( young ) sz\u00e9kelys in my life so far , and contrary to my preconceptions , i did n't noticed anything different in their speech . 
  then i would know 3 languages , not 2 , cool . 
  and `` g\u00f6r\u00f6gdinnye '' is watermelon .
