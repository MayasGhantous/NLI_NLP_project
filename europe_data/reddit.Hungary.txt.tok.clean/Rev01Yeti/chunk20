  so greek melon , i do n't know if it 's popular at you guys . 
  well one of the languages that tolkien made up is partially based on hungarian or something like that . 
  ( i 'm not a tolkien fan so i do n't really know . ), 
  yes , the - i means something like `` of '' in english . 
  and gosh , we have to memorize * a walesi b\u00e1rdok * in school ... 
   an - ia ending was considered more likely they were named like that , but slowly changed to their current form . 
  for a while we called japan `` jap\u00e1nia '' , but it morphed into `` jap\u00e1n '' . 
  the exact same word we used to say japanese , so now `` jap\u00e1n '' means japan and `` jap\u00e1n '' means japanese . 
  ( no capital letters on language and people names in hungarian . ), 
  we like danes , we even have a lego factory !, 
  if you go for a fancy swear , * d\u00e1n p\u00f6csarc * is for you . 
  it means danish dickface , with `` p\u00f6cs '' being a more vulgar word than `` dick '' in english , although they have the same literal and figurative meanings . 
  these dutchies ... srsly . 
  small correction : eleven *, 
  ... aaand we did n't even mentioned yet that `` kurva isten '' is a common swear phrase here . 
  you can deduce we are quite agnostic if we say `` whore god '' a lot . 
  we took good care of your kurwa , my polish friend . 
   honestly i much prefer hungarian 's 44 letters that are pronounced consistently , to french or english 's mangled spelling . 
  seeing that from a french , i 'm kind of delighted . 
  france should adopt our orthography !, 
  * zs\u00f6 sz\u00fci ongro\u00e1 * , if i 'm correct about french pronunciation . 
  viva la linguistic revolution !, 
  * belgaria !, 
  bah , foreigners see the all these `` sz '' letters and shit their pants when it 's just the plain old `` s '' sound . 
  it 's our peculiarity that our `` s '' is the one to sound like the english ( or rather , indo-european ) `` sh '' sound . 
   could ` orsz\u00e1g ' also be translated as ` land ' ? 
  it could be , often they are treated as synonyms when not in existing names . 
  so `` orsz\u00e1g '' could mean land as in an area of uncertain boundaries . 
  ( yup , hungarian does look like french , irish , german , finnish and polish mixed up ! ), 
  hey that looks nice . 
  we have to up our cheese consumption statistics anyway . 
  we just go with * ok * when we say reason . 
  where can i vote for this ? 
  we call them \u00daj-z\u00e9land , szv\u00e1zif\u00f6ld and thaif\u00f6ld . 
  funny thing that we kept `` thai '' instead of just changing it to `` t\u00e1j '' as the pronounciation , but went with `` szv\u00e1zi '' instead of `` swasi '' . 
  by the way , `` f\u00f6ld '' technically does n't mean country , it means land or earth , both literally and figuratively . 
   i would at least have to mention something about romania  that 's fine bro . 
  * ... but the hungry hungarian jokes , for fuck 's sake !, 
  germany 's name came from the slavic name , which means `` mutes '' or something . 
  we borrowed a shitload of slavic words . 
  ( and they took some of us too , like kovach for smith . ), 
  i have no idea about italy though . 
  as for romania , i would say yes , but i 'm not an expert . 
  ladies and gentlemen , the finnish humor by finnishperson !, 
  jeezus !, 
  good , hungary is in good company with the - i ending !, 
  hi , ireland and finland !, 
  i though it 's a hungarian thing to flaunt our inflection system to poor english speakers ... 
  i might not understand half of it , but for some reason i really enjoy reading about comparisons involving finnish and related languages . 
  ... now i learnt why we have the childish word for butt as * pop\u00f3 * ... one of the sillier loanwords we got from germany . 
  beware of the lonely swede !, 
  gee , there 's an awful lot of tech meetups in the city it seems so . 
  i do n't remember knowing about this website . 
   the laws of the country must be equal for everyone . 
  and i do n't deny the general spirit of that . 
  but laws are based on what citizenship you have . 
  ( and where you commit the crime of course . ), 
  the only thing i advocate where non-citizens would be `` discriminated '' is to deport them if they commit serious crimes . 
  yes , non-citizens are equal , and they are n't required to be `` more nice '' . 
  but if they commit something serious , say , murder or rape , i do n't see why they have the right to stay when in fact , they are 1 ) non-citizens and 2 ) seriously broke the law . 
  i ca n't argue for the deportation of citizens because they are , in fact , citizens . 
  but since non-citizens lack the citizenship , it is n't unreasonable to add one extra bit of punishment , namely , to deport them if possible . 
  so , in other words , the laws of the country must be equal for every citizen . 
  non-citizen criminals should n't be welcomed , for those two attributes combined . 
  no , i have n't suggested it , i mocked the idea as `` brilliant '' . 
  germany actually did it . 
  i know ghettos are n't a solution to anything , in fact ghettoization is a problem . 
  but if immigrants themselves tend to stick together and ghettoize themselves , a govt ca n't really do anything without actually dislocating them . 
  i tend to treat a country more akin to a personal home for which people have an emotional attachment , as in , your house where you live . 
  if you have a guest , you usually do n't let him do things that you let your family do . 
  ( yes , might be `` nationalistic '' , but i see a nation as somewhat akin to a family sharing something common , especially shared ancestry and history . ), 
  so , for me , deporting a criminal who is * not a citizen * ( emphasis ) is n't seen as inequality . 
  after all , you have the right to kick out misbehaving guests , especially the really rude ones , it 's your house . 
  of course some might label me xenophobic now ... 
  when in fact i have no problem with other citizens/ethnicities/minorities living here as long as they are law-abiding individually , as everyone else should be individually . 
   when you 're willing to receive people in your country , you must integrate them . 
  no brainer . 
  but flyers with pictograms ? 
  that 's incredibly silly . 
  like it would change the belief of anyone who might think that homosexuals in germany are evil . 
  you do n't change cultural beliefs by distributing childish flyers . 
  it 's pointless . 
  and integration needs willingness from both sides . 
  germany had a 2nd generation migrant problem even before the current influx . 
  same with sweden . 
  you do n't fix a problem by trying your hand at creating a possibility of an even larger one . 
  we would help them to , but they said awful things about us when we protected our schengen external borders , so they can eat their shit now . 
  well i see no reason to extend a political entity 's law to de facto anyone residing on said political entity 's soil regardless of citizenship . 
  i realize the importance of a strong committment to human rights , but germany is basically taking responsibility for the possible actions of unrelated entities not under it 's jurisdiction for people who are not even german citizens and not ( yet ) part of german society . 
  an refugee/asylum seeker should get asylum if he/she is fleeing for war , death or persecution , this is based on morality of human compassion , however , said compassion should not apply when said refugee/asylum seeker commits a heinous crime ( i.e. 
  violating the basic human rights of another person ; killing them , raping them ) , and thus it is no state 's business what would happen to such a person if they get deported . 
  the german idea makes it seem like that once you are deemed a refugee , you * will * stay in germany no matter what you do . 
  the idea that deportation of a criminal * might * lead to their death , i.e. 
  be a capital punishment by proxy , and thus , unconstitutional , is a contrived legal reality to me . 
  i prefer to think that guests do n't have the same rights as the hosts , they are only guests afterall . 
  i agree with that , laws might be relaxed , but let me add that it 's not sympathy for criminals per se , but for human life in general . 
  that , and criminals ca n't suffer if they are dead , while they can suffer being in a prison . 
  ( well as long at it 's not a swedish prison that is . ), 
  would n't you agree that guests ( i.e. 
  immigrants ) should be dealed stricter by law ?
