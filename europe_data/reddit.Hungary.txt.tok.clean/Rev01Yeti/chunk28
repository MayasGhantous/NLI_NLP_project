  yea like i mean , if you run after a group of migrants in the night with only torchlights , and stumble upon a larger group near a bridge , you spend time to actually shine your light around , scanning where exactly there is concrete and where there is n't , so just in case you shoot a bullet it absolutely wo n't ricochet . 
  also i did n't know that being a border guard means you have a photographic memory of square kilometers of undifferentiated wilderness , remembering terrain and architecture details inch by inch . 
  it 's about damn time !, 
  now everybody , brace ourselves for any shit hitting any fan ... 
  i like how people bring up the 1956 refugees when discussing hungary 's anti-immigration stance . 
  hungarians were n't roaming through european borders , were n't avoiding foreign authorities , were n't disregarding asylum and migration laws , were n't demanding this and that level of life/help , were n't fleeing economic situations , and were n't as numerous as a million . 
  getting called a fascist police state , round 2 !, 
  let 's prepare for the eu liberals asking for the expulsion of hungary from the enlightened union !, 
  a blowtorch is deadly if you touch it . 
  does this mean i use deadly force if i operate a blowtorch without the intention to hurt people ? 
  bravo . 
  except there is a chance you can die in a car accident with all the other occupants . 
  i fail to see how a group has more than 0 % chance to be killed by one ricicheting bullet in an accident where deadly intent was most likely not present . 
  avoided is something to be actively done . 
  a warning shot is n't some danger to avoid , as it is n't meant as a deadly force . 
  you tell me they `` avoided '' an accident ? 
  the accident avoided them , because , usually , a ricocheting bullet wo n't kill more than one person . 
  they were more than 50 people . 
  saying 50 + `` survived '' the accident of one is dishonesty and bias at best . 
  the word survivor implies either danger or fear . 
  an accident ca n't cause a survival if there was n't a chance it could happen to you . 
  a ricocheting bullet wo n't ever kill 50 + in a group . 
  on the other hand , you can be a survivor of a school shooting . 
  life itself in general is a hardship , does this mean we are all survivors so far because we are alive ? 
  there are murderers and accidents , yet we still live , are we survivors ? 
  english language can be used to cater to certain people , in this case , those who are pro-migration . 
  using the word `` survivors '' in this context , instead of phrases like `` the other migrants '' or `` the rest of the group '' reinforces the belief held by pro-migration people , which is that migrants face so much inhumanity it 's a shame we have x and y country in the eu . 
  if the very definition of survive is to be alive despite hardships , what was the hardship in this context to legitimize the word ? 
  a ricocheting bullet which accidentally hit a person ? 
  so if i share a street with other people and a car hits someone on the other side of the road , i can be called a survivor of the accident ? 
  ridiculous . 
  in the case of a stray bullet , it 's only valid to talk about survivors and victims if they had contact with the bullet . 
  it makes no sense and makes it biased to say that 50 + people `` survived '' a stray bullet . 
  there is no way they could have been killed by one stray bullet , so there were nothing to survive . 
  they were witnesses at most , not survivors of the incident . 
  spot on !, 
  i 'm amazed how such an accident can have `` survivors '' . 
  i wonder what chance you have for a single bullet to kill all of the migrants . 
  a perfectly neutral word ? 
  `` surviving '' is a loaded word and implies that the ricocheting bullet had the chance to kill all of the migrants . 
  or that all of the migrants faced a threat of death , not that they were next to an accident happening to one of them . 
  `` surviving '' is a word more fitting to a murder spree or a train wreck . 
  the bbc criticized as being anti-immigrant ? 
  hell , they always called them refugees until around mid-september . 
  they always use emotional imagery and dramatic phrases to portray migrants as innocent sufferers who are hindered by evil eu governments . 
  you might have read that it was 10 pm , and most likely the bridge was n't illuminated exactly like the golden gate bridge . 
  10 pm in bulgarian countryside is pretty much pitch dark , public lighting does n't help much if you go further away from a settlement . 
  uh , reports say it happened around 10 pm . 
  it 's night , are we sure that policeman/border guard saw the exact surroundings when he fired , probably in a not-so-exactly premediated upward direction ? 
  well maybe , just maybe , if these migrants walk their way through european borders , disregarding any and all eu , national and local rules about asylum and immigration , avoiding authorities and identification , they might be treated with suspicion . 
  they should be assumed to have unlawful intentions until proven otherwise . 
  or do you support 1 + million foreign citizens marching across national borders unchecked just because a number of them are likely to be refugees ? 
  do you disregard laws ? 
  more like hatred towards people who just demand and not respect your help you can provide , do n't you think ? 
  quote : `` germany , germany , let us go !, 
  we need freedom !, 
  we do n't want to stay in < insert country here  , it 's poor ! '', 
  trust me , freedom of the press is so much alive that the most viewed tv channel ( rtl klub ) shits on orb\u00e1n and his `` regime '' every single day in their newscast , finding every single spending of the govt and unearthing everything that might look like corruption or money-blowing luxury . 
  leftist newspapers can write what they want about him and the govt , one magazine was published lately with an orb\u00e1n portrait having a razor-wire hitler moustache . 
  if this is n't free press , i do n't know what is . 
  as for what is marriage , it 's not like hungary is the last standing european country which do n't recognize same-sex marriages as marriage in the judeo-christian sense or whatever this context is called . 
  got ta love incoming multiculturalism . 
  let 's welcome ` refugees ' from honor-based societies , right , guys ? 
  except in these `` honor killing '' scenarios , the murderer commits murder , not suicide . 
  the `` honor '' in these cases are part of the muslim faith , which values the chastity of the daughter to be highly valuable . 
   according to the un refugee convention , which is the base for asylum laws in the eu , only very few crimes void the right to asylum . 
  you really care about all the human rights of all these so-called refugees , no matter what they do or think in their host country . 
  they could piss on the german flag and call you a worthless idiot , steal your wallet , and spit on you , and you would still agree that the specific people doing this could and should get an asylum if they are from syria . 
  because to be a decent human , you have to throw away any common sense about expecting respect from people you want to help in their needs . 
  good job !, 
  funny enough , they started skipping over denmark after they cut their support . 
  now they are complaining about lack of wealth ( housing , jobs etc. ), 
  in sweden and finland , must be sincere refugee plight , right ? 
  well , in fact , bulgaria is a wealthy country , with generous social aid programs , and plenty of well-paying jobs awaiting , a dream for refugees , is n't it ? 
  almost as good as warm norway up there . 
   or the fact that many `` native europeans '' simply do not want children . 
  research shows that second-generation `` migrants '' , i.e. 
  the children of migrants/refugees do n't have that many children either if they integrate . 
  so migrants are n't really the solution to demographic problems either , especially not if countries are forced to try integrate thousands of people with a very different cultural and value system . 
  i knew finland is nice , but this ... 
  i 'm jelly .

  the last one is a really unique one though , we mostly just go with a blocky pattern . 
  these fucking luxury housing blocks with cameras and a swimming pool . 
  yeah , looks very fancy but it 's a ) soulless b ) expensive as fuck . 
  actually , lately panel housing prices are going up madly , it 's insane . 
  even though panels were deemed the shitties type of dwelling like a good decade ago . 
  that 's shitty , nobody should give a stigma about that , economy and personal reasons can suck . 
  i know it too well ... 
  wow polan is advance better than hungary ... 
  joke aside , i guess this is a communist thing , authorities have to know where you live , and your id card ( at least here ) is only actually valid with a `` living place card '' giving your address . 
  taxation is n't a good analogy for those who think that in a rational world , every and all organs should be put to a good use irregwrdless of what people say . 
  a rather clumsy example , but expecting people to be okay with their organs being harvested after `` they do n't need them anyway '' is like expecting people to give up any kind of property that they do n't ever use ( broken toys , for example ) , so they could be given to very poor children who never had toys , in order to satisfy an implied fundamental right ( right to happiness in this example ) . 
  of course it can be asked that why would people care if they would be dead by thatvtime anyeay ? 
  and saving human life is a positive thing . 
  but the `` why should people care what happens after they die '' question goes both ways . 
  since dead people ca n't either save or prevent the saving of someone ( because a lack of agency ) , it 's harder to argue about the morality of organ transplant . 
  ( as in , agents and actions should be existing at the same time to question their morality . ), 
  so we can see the opt-out system is a `` clever trick '' to get more organs vs the selfishness and greed of irrational people with the goal of saving more lifes . 
  clever because it is thought that most people would n't know they are in an opt-out system , and because nobody likes going through paperwork especially if it deals with death and dead bodies .
