  by all means , my biggest issue is this `` trickery '' i perceive , not the goal of saving more people by using organs from dead people . 
  so if i get it right , your view is that ideally the state should take ownership of dead bodies and disregard the irrational wishes of living people ( because emotions ) , and just harvest organs anyway in a perfectly rational world ? 
  would n't that place human life above everything else , including above the wishes and feelings of living humans , just because they are irrational ? 
  the question of receiving transplants if you are not in an opt-in system is interesting . 
  doctors definitely have the moral duty to use everything in their power to save a human . 
  since not all humans are doctors , i would n't say that everyone is morally obligated to do everything in their power to save a human life especially considering that doctors save a life directly , and organ donors save a life indirectly . 
  by the time we die , any and all moral obligations cease to exist anyway , so since the transplant would happen after you are dead , it is not really sensible to talk about the morality of saving or not saving someone in theory . 
  nah i just played the devil 's advocate with that reasoning . 
  well , personaly i have no issue with organ donation per se , people can do whatever with their organs , including letting them be donated , but i 'm not sure i can support opt-out systems . 
  yes , it would save many people , that 's rational . 
  my issue is with that some people would n't be aware that there organs will be harvested after they die if they do n't explicitly opt-out . 
  not that the dead care anymore , but there are simply things about humankind which we ca n't rationalize . 
   to let countless of people die because of what are essentially aesthetic sensibilities ( of the living , mind you , dead people have none ) is what seems disrespectful to me . 
  rereading your post , just to comment on this ... 
  i do n't think anything can be question with purely rational reasoning when it comes to human nature . 
  respecting the dead is in fact just a social taboo for some irrational reason ( it 's like respecting a rock , from a rational viewpoint ) , but irregardless of the cold logic , i 'm not completely sure we should rethink * all * our societal taboos . 
  i 'm not going further , but i believe in some kind of emotional essentialism ; we humans are fundamentally irrational , therefore , we can not and should not try to rationalize everything about ourselves . 
  in princible , organ donation is wonderful , especially if you or someone you care about gets another chance at life . 
  but ultimately , people tend to not care that much about people that exist in * theory * but not as something immediately responsible . 
  john 's liver might theoretically save someone who john never knew and would never know , thus for john , it is a theoretical human being in his mind , not an actual person he could save without knowing . 
  i did n't looked into statistics , but i presume more people of the world would support an opt-in system than an opt-out system , and this does n't have to do anything with selfishness or egocentrism , i would say it 's more innate . 
  just how most people do n't really care about all the poor people of the world , even if they would help them relatively easily ( and even if they could be helped enormously if enough people woul just give a little bit of help ) . 
  so i do n't see it as a matter of disrespectfulness , because respect in this sense can not exist between two person who does n't exist in each other 's perception and would n't even have the possibility of a conscious connection to each other if an organ transplant would occur . 
  in other words , say , suppose my liver is n't transplanted and if it would have been , it would save a guy . 
  i would n't say i disrespected that guy , for i did n't even know he existed . 
  if i would know , there would be no transplantion . 
  i would say that i would be schr\u00f6dinger 's organ donor ; a potential recipient would be out of my `` reality '' anyway , so as far as i 'm concerned about reality , there is no meaningful choice . 
  while , thinking rationally , i can acknowledge that it * can * save someone , it 's hard to rationalize why it matters to me if i exclude emotional reasoning . 
  sorry , this went into weird territory , this would better fit r/philosophy , and i should really go sleep now , it 's late ... also sorry for any late-night typos . 
   but he can also be expected to part with that which he is not using , and others need . 
  i do n't know if there should be a default expectation for that from the society . 
  organs are n't exactly private property , but i am expected to give away any personal property just because i 'm 100 % sure i would never ever need them and i do n't have any other reason to keep them ? 
  i do n't agree . 
  mind you , my concern is rather about people not really realizing that they * have * to opt-out . 
  if all people would know this and it does n't require a shitload of boring bureucracy to opt-out , i support it in theory . 
  i would agree more with an opt-out system if every and all organs would actually save a life . 
  but in reality , it is more like someone * might * be saved because someone else somewhere else was unlucky enough to die in a random incident . 
  it requires a lot of random variables for an organ to save someone , and an opt-out system certainly seems like a more reductionist approach when it comes to how to untangle the issue of ownership of a dead body and its parts . 
  i agree , this is part philosophy , while it can actually save lifes . 
  but there are a lot of areas where we could potentially save more lives if we would n't have disagreements on philosophical grounds . 
  ( see the us gun control debate , etcetera . ), 
  well the ussr tried to supervise us for a few decades , but no thanks , it was a pretty uncomfortable assfuck , no more . 
  you sure sound like a racist bashing all eastern europeans . 
   at the same time hungary and other eastern countries sell weapons to isis that help foment the wars that bring refugees to hungary doorstep . 
  you should be on comedy central , dude , this is top tier laughing material . 
  except , the shitty english skills you seem to possess . 
   i as a german feel i have more in common with chinese and americans than eastern europeans . 
  you mean those chinese who in general do n't care about environmentalism and feminism or the glorious americans who think that being an american is the pinnacle of enlightement and who advocate unrestricted capitalism ? 
  see , generalizations are so much fun !, 
  a true ally . 
  let 's do the intermarium and fuck this federalist shit . 
   i 'm opposing the logic `` they are not fleeing the war , because they have n't stopped immediately after leaving the warzone '' . 
  they do n't need to stop right after the syrian-turkish border line , but it 's so painfully obvious that they just want to cross hungary because hungary is in their way while being en route to the * wealthiest * european countries . 
  while openly disregarding * our * rules and customs and despising us as a * poor * country . 
  and yet most of western europe expects us to openly welcome , help , feed , transport these people , while we even struggle with our own * internal * problems . 
  except there is no `` far right '' party in a leading position in any european country . 
  you should really take your pill and stop your mindless hate about anything eastern european just because they do n't want to deal with shit they have n't caused . 
   what 's up with the hate for you guys all of a sudden ? 
  all of a sudden ? 
  lol , where were you during last year 's r\u00f6szke border crossing incident ? 
  we were pretty much the new reich . 
  i dunno , ask the chinese and vietnamese living in budapest , they feel quite fine here . 
  they are - gasp - even respected by many . 
  daaaym , this dude is good at copypasting bullshite . 
  well , not anymore , that is . 
  still , they can mostly count on jobbik in most matters if they would need a supermajority . 
   no , i 'm sorry , but # 67 in the world press freedom ranking is very concrete . 
  one thing is the world press freedom * ranking * ( and abstract measure which was calculated by whoever knows how ) , and another is the * day-to-day reality * inside hungary . 
  if press freedom was under a * serious * threat here , then the most watched tv station in hungary , rtl klub , would n't shit on the govt , fidesz , orb\u00e1n , and his `` friends '' pretty much every day in their newscast . 
  it 's full of `` corruption '' and `` illiberal democracy '' news and regularly features commantary by opposition parties , human rights activists , and so on , sometimes openly insulting orb\u00e1n or members of the govt . 
  if hungary is compared to russia , trust me , it 's quite far from it . 
  naaah just federalists ... 
  it 's not the same , i promise !, 
   and hungary has every right to protect its border . 
  look at what 's happening in france . 
  it 's funny how many lefty people care more about the hungarian fence sitting there next to non-eu serbia ( merely presenting an obstacle and forcing a detour ) vs the situation at calais whereas two eu member states ca n't sort out shit in a `` humanitarian '' manner . 
  citation needed . 
  really , people , is n't likening hungary to a dprk-in-making getting old ? 
  it 's painful and overused by now thanks to all the bleeding hearted leftists and federalists in europe . 
   nobody on the hungarian border is there because it 's the closest safe haven . 
  what 's even better , they are n't even looking for a safe haven near hungary , hungary just happens to be in their way while being en route to glorious germany or sweden ... 
   they also sent millions of their people to the west , so we have already taken in far more people than eastern europe . 
  you did n't had to take in anybody because those people actually wanted to work and more-or-less learn the language . 
  by the way , they respect local laws and customs . 
   borderless schengen where your freedom of movement is guaranteed for ** schengen ** citizens , not every single homo sapiens who manage to try walking through europe . 
  except in the dream of hardcore globalist leftists ' wet dreams . 
  there is no such thing as a border in those kind of dreams . 
   full bearded , 1,90 m , 14yo boys hey , you did n't know that kids from wartime syria and poor sub-saharan africa have such a special diet that they grow so big and hairy ? 
   the right to asylum shall be guaranteed the sad reality is nobody ever really wanted to be given asylum here , they just want to pass hungary and end up in countries they find more willing and more able to give them ~ ~ money ~ ~ help . 
  paying bazillions to erdogan to keep people in shitty camps in turkey : ** totally fine ** forcing refugees and a bazillion poor migrants to take slightly longer route for germany : ** level 182 evul **, 
  being openly racist about eastern europeans , hm ? 
  interesting , my friend . 
  you seem to believe that the eu structural funds are payments for agreeing , but they are to get this fucking region out of the effects of goddamn communism , which western europe was keen to let eastern europe sink into after ww2 . 
  remember ? 
  every allied power was all good with the ussr establishing itself us eastern europe 's assfucker for roughly four fricking decades . 
  and yet eastern europe should be all humbled and obedient because of being let into the eu and getting funds to actually be able to compete with the west in living standards ? 
  doing anything that the west asks for ? 
  after pretty much all local business was bought by western companies ? 
   all those xenophobic countries get billions of western european tax money and send millions their people to the west while complaining about immigration to their country except nobody sends their people to the west , eastern european countries just ca n't fucking compete with western european countries when it comes to wages , after having 40 + years of communist rule , good morning . 
  that 's another reason why the eu structural funds go towards the east : fucking communism and its ruinous effects .
