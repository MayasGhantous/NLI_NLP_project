in hungary there is this poster gallery every year called @rc ( arc = face ) . 
  there are so many creative , funny , funny-sad , sarcastic , ironic posters !, 
  so in 2007 ( after gyurcs\u00e1ny 's second election , and after the famous [ '' \u0150sz\u00f6d-speech '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferenc_gyurcs%c3%a1ny%27s_speech_in_balaton%c5%91sz%c3%b6d_in_may_2006 ) ) there was [ this gem ] ( http://www.alon.hu/ezimagecatalogue/catalogue/variations/5209-450x450.jpg ) as a show-piece . 
  the funny thing is the pun : `` le monde '' reads `` lemond-e '' in hungarian , meaning `` will he resign ? '', 
  so every time i read about le monde , the picture above is the first that comes to my mind . 
  yeah . 
  with ~ 2.1 m votes . 
  from ~ 4.8 m altogether . 
  in a country , where ~ 7.5 m people can vote . 
  so fidesz was elected by about the 30 % of hungarian voters . 
  i 'm always baffled by these numbers . 
  wow , this is just ... wow . 
  k\u00fcbler-ross model for having hungarian politics : * 1st stage , denial : `` maybe they 'll be okay this year . '', 
  * 2nd stage , anger : `` they are as bad , as the rest !, 
  i hate them ! '', 
  * 3rd stage , bargaining : `` maybe they need time , or we need another ruling party . '', 
  * 4th stage , depression : `` the other parties are not good either , and i ca n't think of any solution anymore . '', 
  * 5th stage , acceptance : `` meh . '', 
  again , you are averting the conversation about being biased and propaganda . 
  but i 'll play along , since you wo n't acknowledge the rules of arguments . 
  you are right , i did not address worldview vs. personal opinion , because your opinion on the matter was n't attacked , and it is n't a crime to think differently than the rest of the world . 
  i just do n't get why you included this in your argument , since it had n't been mentioned in any way , and did not contribute to the conversation . 
  my guess is that you tried to sidetrack the subject . 
  look up red herring . 
  and baiting for that matter . 
   what is your view on islam , christianity and israels politics ? 
  i try to have no involvement in a feud so ancient , for i have no working solution . 
  i feel sorry for the people , the victims on both sides , who just want to live in peace . 
  losing an argument is n't a big deal . 
  not learning from it is . 
  there were arguments here that you choose to ignore , thus rendering the whole thing meaningless . 
  anything beyond this point is just stupid internet rage , that i have no desire participate in . 
  let me chime in this converstion . 
   sorry , but this argument is just weak . 
  it is n't an argument . 
  why is your view not bullshit ? 
  if someone does n't agree on an opinion , it does n't mean they believe the complete opposite . 
  what you are doing is called ( among other things ) black-and-white fallacy , and has no place in a proper argument . 
  cyridius did n't say that they have pro-muslim/anti-israel views , but that you have anti-muslim/pro-israel views . 
  they may be wrong , but since you do link these articles , and nothing from the other side of the argument , it suggests that you do have these views , and i tend to agree with cyridius . 
   and is it not much more propaganda , if one makes accusations based not on arguments but on emotions ? 
  let 's see , what happened so far . 
  * cyridius pointed out you are not impartial . 
  * you played the false dilemma card . 
  * cyridius said that you should n't do this , and told you that you are biased , and based on your comment history you are not fit as news source . 
  * playing black and white again , but with force now . 
  you want arguments besides emotion . 
  up this point there were no arguments about the article , but about the source ( you ) . 
  there was no actual emotion involved . 
  * cyridius calls you out on the b&w fallacy again , and labels the news sites you cite as propaganda . 
  * you dismiss cyridius ' accusation that you use wrong argument . 
  funny , how you mentioned ad hominem before , because that 's what you 're doing right now : not defending your point ( that you are not biased and your sources are not propaganda ) , but attacking your opponent . 
  * recursion !, 
  sorry for being captain obvious , but this is my observation about an argument that you are about to lose . 
  beside this , you make no sense . 
  it 's under the protection of historic preservation , so it wo n't be demolished . 
  i 'm pretty sure , it still can be visited . 
  actually , we do use cancer as a swear word in hungary . 
  ( or `` to hell with it/him/her '' in english ) , literally : `` may cancer fall into it/him/her '' . 
  we have other curses that originate from illness . 
  for example `` franc '' ( like `` francba '' or `` a franc essen bele '' and the like ) comes from the expression of `` francia betegs\u00e9g '' ( `` french illness '' ) meaning syphilis . 
  other is `` fene '' ( like `` fen\u00e9be '' or `` a fene egye meg '' ) , that is a very interesting one : fene is a very old word that has roots in an other word , farkas , or wolf in english . 
  wolves were considered very bad luck , even sickness , they became synonymous with illness . 
  this was a really long time ago , so this fact is not widely known . 
  the rest ... cursing is an art form in hungary ( i do n't know whether to be proud or ashamed of this ) , a wall of text would n't be enough to write about it . 
   our former dictator nicolai ceasescu is considered the best president we 've ever had . 
  { this is shocking , i imagine the romanians on / r/europe have their opinions } about a year ago , if i remember correctly , there was this poll that showed if [ j\u00e1nos k\u00e1d\u00e1r ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%a1nos_k%c3%a1d%c3%a1r ) had been alive , he 'd been re-elected as pm . 
  he was kind of an okay figure at the time , but ceasescu and his wife ... just oh my god . 
  this reminds me attacks on [ house of terror ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_terror ) , when it opened back in 2002 . 
  i really hope that your museum will remain open . 
  tens of millions of people were killed and tortured , and yet , their memory seems to be swept under the rug all the time . 
  on the other hand , hungary is supposed to be hot in late spring-early summer . 
  well , i 'm freezing my ass off . 
  something is clearly not right . 
  if it 's baked , it would become a proper bread . 
  it 's like saying that a flat bread is n't bread , since it does n't contain yeast ( l\u00e1ngos does ) . 
  as someone said earlier , yes , but it 's a salty kind of doughnut . 
  langall\u00f3 on the other hand is more like a bread ( it is also called `` bread l\u00e1ngos '' ) . 
  the difference is only that l\u00e1ngos is fryed , langall\u00f3 is baked . 
  the recipe is the same .

  traditional hungarian flat bread and summer food . 
  other variant is [ langall\u00f3 ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xu_kpjyg1pk/tqc_mqzj3ii/aaaaaaaab3k/yv_pet7ebkg/s1600/langallo.jpg ) with sour ream , onion and bacon . 
  i honestly feel sorry for these people ( though it 's becoming more difficult every day ) . 
  but fuck these awareness websites with a thick metal bar . 
  what 's next ? 
  refugees 2016 ? 
  a media show about others ' misfortune ? 
  to caress our consciousness when ( or if ) we donate to these organizations ? 
  mind you , i ** do ** think that we should help somehow , but i highly doubt what these organizations do is sustainable . 
  furthermore : please cease this emotional warfare against us , i feel my own problems invalidated . 
   is there a similar area in hungary perceived in such a way ? 
  hmmm let 's see . 
  i do n't think so . 
  we have nutjobs regardless of area . 
  i do want to make this `` idiotic hijinks '' thread here , but if i do it now , it will lose its purpose : laughing about , and mocking us and each other . 
  in the lights of recent news it would n't be lighthearted . 
  welcome to the petra l\u00e1szl\u00f3 side of the media . 
  the european anti-superhero ? 
  until there is a mirror , [ here is a hungarian article ] ( http://index.hu/kulfold/2015/09/25/szijjarto_peter_menekultvalsag_media_migracio/ ) about the interview from index .
