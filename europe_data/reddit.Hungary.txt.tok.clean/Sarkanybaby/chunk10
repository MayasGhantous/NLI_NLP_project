  the first letter is upper-case because it 's a country 's name , but also we spell `` afrikai '' lower-case ( it roughly means `` of africa '' ) - but * d\u00e9l-afrikai k\u00f6zt\u00e1rsas\u00e1gi * means `` of the republic of south africa '',

  by the way , do you have songs about europe ? 
   and everyone is forgetting that hungary ** had ** presidential elections this year . 
  ftfy next year will be interesting though with the parliamentary elections . 
  all i could think about that he would have to rethink the `` stop brussels ! '', 
  slogan , and change it to `` stop copenhangen for christ sake !!!, 
  this is the usual eye-wash that orb\u00e1n likes so much . 
  the question is , what ( or which ? ), 
  controversial law/monetary endeavor/diplomatic failure exactly he wants to cover with it . 
  too bad you did n't link a source on the economy , i had to look for it . 
  but yeah , i can admit if i 'm wrong , and it really seems like that the economy is on the rise . 
  i 'm not sure how long it will stay and whom to credit for it though . 
  also , my opinions : also on the economy : tell this to eastern hungary , and see the reactions . 
  people there rarely feel anything from these oh-so-rising economy . 
   orban is very pro eu of course he is , where do you think his wealth comes from ? 
   he is imposing sanction on russia let 's wait for those sanctions , orb\u00e1n really likes to talk about anything and everything . 
   unemployment in hungary is at 4,3 % . 
  thanks to the * k\u00f6zmunkaprogram * , that 's good for the numbers , debatable otherwise . 
   you can see him polling at 50 % + / - ** 10 % , but mostly around -5 % ** ftfy . 
  let 's also wait for the elections next year , since people like to talk big , then stay at home during big decisions . 
  hungarian apathy is a force to be reckoned with . 
  i doubt that he 'll do anything self-compromising against the eu . 
  he , and this company of sycophants are like ticks on a dog . 
  they can shout all they want , as long as the dog does n't notice them . 
  are you serious ? 
  you are serious !, 
  let me laugh more !, 
   he also is doing miracle with his countries economy from the very wiki article you linked :  following the mild recession of 2012 , the gdp picked up again from 2014 , and based on the commission 's winter 2015 forecast it was projected to have accelerated to 3.3 % . 
  the more dynamic economic performance attributed to a moderately growing domestic demand and supported the growth of gross fixed capital formation . 
  the surge ( 3.8 % in the first half of 2014 ) , however ** was only achieved via temporary measures and factors , such as the stepped-up absorption of eu-funds and the central bank 's funding for growth scheme ** , which subsidised loans for small-and medium-sized enterprises . 
  [ 67 ] the fundaments of growth did n't considerably change in 2015 as well - the government supported eu-fund transfers along with the moderately successful central bank loans of economic revitalization - fueled the fair gdp growth . 
  however , from the beginning of 2016 , the significantly shrunk base of available eu-funds had an immediate impact on the country 's performance . 
  the disappointing quarterly data showed a mere 0,9 % hike beating most expectations . 
  ** therefore , the government may need to revise its year-on-year growth in the upcoming months . 
  ** translation : - orb\u00e1n has nothing to do with it - also , he fucked up . 
  & nbsp ;  democratically elected with 50 % of vote from population . 
  the last parliamentary election 's turnout was 61.73 % , and from this 44.87 % voted for fidesz . 
  2,264,780 people . 
  so less than 1/3rd of all the eligible voters voted for fidesz , and that was little more than 1/5th of hungary 's population in 2014 . 
  sources : [ hungarian parliamentary election , 2014 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_parliamentary_election,_2014 ) [ hungary 's population ] ( https://www.ksh.hu/interaktiv/korfak/orszag.html ), 
  how about an orxit , and leave hungary finally the fuck alone ? 
  also  the crowning of arpad as first king of the magyars ( hungarian people ) marked the beginning of the hungarian state in 896 . 
  - \u00c1rp\u00e1d was n't crowned - he was n't a king , was n't considered a king - 896 was the honfoglal\u00e1s , when magyars came to the carpathian basin - our first king was szent istv\u00e1n ( or saint stephen ) , his crowning was around 1000 . 
  people tend to disagree about the date and the circumstances . 
  fun fact : hungarian does n't have separate word for the top the flower . 
  we however have a word for flower bud ( `` bimb\u00f3 '' ) and tree bud ( `` r\u00fcgy '' ) . 
   bichisciaba  giula meanwhile the language is really trying . 
  i knew the whole thing was the epitome of clusterfuck , but damn . 
  this reminds me the seven wonder of communism . 
  everybody had a job . 
  although everybody had a job , nobody did anything . 
  although nobody did anything , the plan was fulfilled 100 % . 
  although the plan was fulfilled 100 % , you could n't buy anything . 
  although you could n't buy anything , everybody had everything . 
  although everybody had everything , everybody was stealing . 
  although everybody was stealing , nothing was amiss . 
  but honestly , the more you think about communism , the more chilling and surreal it becomes . 
   as he will take all his secrets to his grave . 
  you know , i never really thought about why exactly people considered executing the ceausescus wrong , but this comment makes sense , and i feel stupid . 
  edit : i accidentally a word . 
  but seriously , consonant clusters are rare , we avoid them . 
  we have double letter consonants ( like * sz * , * gy * and friends ) , but they separate letters with separate sounds . 
   i 'm all for equality . 
  but please let 's not employ people on the basis of gender , skin colour or culture . 
  let 's stick to merit , shall we ? 
  also , my question : is it the same job ? 
  no , this is a serious question , somehow i do n't really see this written down explicitly anywhere . 
  [ this . 
  i ca n't upvote you enough . 
   * autosse * i 'm still trying to process the fact that you do n't have vowel harmony . 
  i think we all had problems with these two . 
  beats me . 
  maybe because it 's a * jel * , not a * rag * like the rest ? 
  yup . 
  here is a list from [ here ] ( http://www.hungarianreference.com/nouns/ ) - - t - accusative - direct object of verbs - - nak/nek - dative - indirect object of verbs ( for , to ) - - ba/be - illative - into , to - - ban/ben - inessive - in , inside - - b\u00f3l / b\u0151l - elative - out of , from - - hoz/hez/h \u00f6z - allative - towards , to - - n\u00e1l / n\u00e9l - adessive - at , by - - t\u00f3l / t\u0151l - ablative - away from - - ra/re - sublative - onto , to - - n - superessive - on , in [ - on/en / \u00f6n , because sometimes a vowel needed to pronounce the word better ] - - r\u00f3l / r\u0151l - delative - from , from off ; about - - val/vel - instrumental - with [ the `` v '' always changes to the noun 's last consonant ] - - \u00e9rt - causal-final - for , because of - - ig - terminative - until - - kor - temporal - age , - time , - hood , era - - v\u00e1 / v\u00e9 - translative - turning into [ the `` v '' always changes to the noun 's last consonant ] - - f\u00e9le - kinds of edit : oh yeah , that 's 17 . 
  nominative is the last one , it is without suffixes , so it 's not on the list . 
  well , to be fair , in hungarian there are no grammatical genders , so you only need to learn the post-fixes , be mindful of the vowel harmony , and learn some other minor rules . 
  18 sounds way too many , but they are fairly simple and logical . 
  ftfy, 
  ~ ~ hungarian is similar : ~ ~ ~ ~ egy = one ~ ~ ~ ~ - szer = times ~ ~ ~ ~ - \u0171 = affix to create an adjective ~ ~ ~ ~ do you use `` kerta '' alone as a separate word ? 
  because for example '' - szer '' in hungarian , in this meaning is never alone ( also it changes according to vowel harmony - * \u00f6tsz\u00f6r * : five times , * hatszor * : six times , * h\u00e9tszer * : seven times ) . ~ ~ edit : i must be retarded , see https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5vs7cz/simple_as_that/de5d0ym/, 
   those kind of characters are wasting my time if only it was just time they 're wasting . 
  the only thing we could teach is apathy . 
  [ been there , done that ... ] ( http://kep.cdn.indexvas.hu/1/0/1440/14409/144096/14409688_aaf83ae2534b852fd4e7eeb59e37e8fc_wm.png ), 
  you know the feeling when you are watching an really embarrassing character on tv and you feel the shame ? 
  now multiply it with 20 . 
  congratulation , you gained hungarian perspective !, 
  i know , i meant this prediction based on present conditions . 
  for example , a couple hundreds of years ago if a significant population was moving/moved to a different location ( like after the defeat of the ottoman empire in europe ) they were pressed to adapt . 
  maybe they did n't have to learn the language , at least not first . 
  they even kept their own culture , but also got drifted from their roots . 
  these people slowly but surely assimilated or integrated into the host country . 
  nowadays though , when you are two clicks from a webpage in your own language , a skype/whatsup/messenger call from home , where transport around the world is easy , culture can be moved , assimilation seems impossible , integration is hindered ( assuming that the migrating population is n't seriously willing to integrate into the host country ) . 
  ( i hope this makes sense ... ), 
  i heard that budapest 's [ bubi ] ( https://molbubi.bkk.hu/ ) is good . 
  it 's pretty big ( 1286 bikes with 112 docking stations ) , and it is said to be easy to use . 
  i do n't know much about it though , i 'm a public transport person myself . 
  i think the proper word would be `` concerned '' .
