   ** they integrated really well with our society , are completely peaceful and consider themselves polish . 
  ** you missed this part of the comment . 
  also , this is called assimilation , history can give you tons of examples of it , if you know where to look . 
  since we are talking about a historical population , it 's only fair to check historical facts :  according to some estimates , by 1590 -- 1591 there were about 200,000 lipka tatars living in the polish -- lithuanian commonwealth and about 400 mosques serving them . 
  [ where the commonwealth 's population was ~ 8 million . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographic_history_of_poland#polish.e2.80.93lithuanian_commonwealth_.281569.e2.80.931795.29 ) of course it 's difficult to say that if we get thousands of syrian refugees/migrants now , how will they behave 200-500 years later . 
  but since society changed with modern technology , we can draw conclusions , we can ( or should be able to ) predict a possible future . 
  ( think about how modern communication can influence culture . ), 
  please bring your anti-corruption politicians for a visit too !, 
  because the word itself is not a derivative of `` magyar '' ( like for example ma\u010farsko is ) . 
  yeah , i too get that a lot . 
  seriously , politicians and journalists like to forget that more that a third of hungarians do n't vote , and proclaim the people 's love for ~ ~ the great leader ~ ~ ~ ~ the party ~ ~ orb\u00e1n . 
  poster . 
  long ago , i read it somewhere , that in the us politicians use controversial political and economical/monetary issues to cover their controversial personal affairs , but in hungary politicians do the opposite . 
  i see it is more like an eastern european thing .

  see how the longes line is the orange ones ?

  the / r/the _ viktor sub is thankfully dead , but yeah , there is that too . 
  you know what ? 
  this looks interesting !, 
  i like pictures too , but what about ... let 's say , `` books of europe '' or `` tv series of europe '' ? 
  less exhibitionism , more discussion ? 
  while this is seriously awesome , i 'm begging you guys , not another `` things of europe '' series !, 
  we 're barely over the castles and bad puns !, 
  thank god , hungarian food is usually known internationally as `` goulash '' , and they leave the rest alone . 
  though the thing they use as `` paprika '' has a questionable color . 
  call it `` ground pepper '' , or `` chili '' , or something !, 
  you know , i miss the time when social media was used by angsty teenagers and bored housewives to whine about relationships and post awful memes . 
  well apparently they did give a shit . 
  that would be the point of it : if the government ignores an eu anti-corruption law , they would have their asses handed to them . 
  and for this i really admire ( and kind of envy ) you . 
  i thought about a revolution , but after that ... whom would we put in power ? 
  there you see our problem now . 
  send help . 
  looks at flair  ruins of europe wants to weep . 
  but seriously , there are only a handful of intact castles remain in hungary , the rest were razed in < pick a war of the last 600 years  . 
  it 's a shame , really . 
  do n't worry , most people do realise that he is one of the sources of our problems . 
  sadly there is n't much that we could do against it . 
   i 've even heard `` gom '' for `` esztergom '' . 
  well , i tried . 
  yup .

  since i do n't know too much about buddhism , i checked our saviour , [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swastika#appearance ) . 
  yeah , i was n't right about the `` mirrored swastika '' , but also as it turns out they are waaay more various in appearance as i initially thought . 
  tl ; dr : both are correct . 
  i saw an asian ( maybe chinese or vietnamese ) in budapest with a nazi reichsadler tattoo . 
  okay , the swastika was mirrored , but hey !, 
  only if you say `` c-t\u00edpus\u00fa \u00e1llampolg\u00e1r '' , or something like that . 
  welcome to the `` are you hungary , eat a turkey '' world . 
  sure , you 're right , but i think the problem in the end is not how good a recognizing software is , but how fb wo n't acknowledge their fault . 
  it seems like because the software gives false positives , they choose the easiest way to deal with it : ban every nipple and penis . 
  no exceptions , no problems . 
  disregarding user complain is just the cherry on top , as if they are determined to commit suicide . 
   the exceptions goes strait to the news lol no , the key sentence was this :  `` the use of images or video of nude bodies or plunging necklines is not allowed , even if the use is for artistic or educational reasons . '' a simple reverse search could tell you that this is a statue , a cultural icon , or that naked girl was one of the best know photograph of all times . 
  fb just does n't care . 
  i wonder when will be the cooties banned . 
  congratulation !, 
  now you 're the mod of / r/europecirclejerk !, 
  yeah , * the witness * is the one true hungarian meme factory . 
  also , the idea of growing orange in hungary is also sadly true . 
   `` oh but real communism has n't been tried ! '', 
  what 's the difference between the existing and working communism ? 
  the existing does n't work , the working does n't exist . 
   education hah !, 
   industrialisation do you know how the communists called hungary ? 
  `` home of the iron and steel . '', 
  do you know what kind of industry is worst idea here ? 
  yes , heavy industry !, 
  this whole thing is a joke . 
  they had a ridiculous idea , and they followed it , it did n't matter that they had to import the ore . steel my ass . 
  what 's next ? 
  orange ? 
  `` a little yellow , a little sour , but ours . 
   i do n't get how you can be pro-ghaddafi though since he 's kind of ... well ... dead ... tell that to the soviet fans over the pond . 
  i also heard that they wanted political asylum .
