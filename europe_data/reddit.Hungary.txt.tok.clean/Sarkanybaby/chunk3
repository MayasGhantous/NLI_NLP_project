  the fields , the mountains , animals , houses , even the bees are big as the sheep ! '', 
    the people around him half astonished , half suspicious asked :   `` if the bees are so big , how big are the hives ? '', 
    `` well , '' the man said `` about the size of our normal hives . '', 
    at this point everyone laughed at him . 
  `` how would the bees fit in those hives ? '', 
    from that day on his whole family received the nickname : `` sheep '', 
  hungary 's problem in a nutshell . 
  yeah , this is what we need . 
  the cavemen out of their hole . 
  we do n't need these hooligans , who [ thrashed the planet\u00e1rium ] ( http://www.planetarium.hu/futball-huliganok_garazdalkodtak_a_planetariumnal ) , go home you iq beggars !, 
  let me ask you something ( without any venom and cynicism ) , that i found somewhat strange . 
  hungary began this fence months ago , with the very objective of divert the migrants from us towards ( mostly ) croatia . 
  no it was n't ... nice . 
  yes , it is a very dirty thing to do . 
  yeah , i 'm not proud of it either . 
  but one thing : the purpose of the fence was n't exactly a secret . 
  so my question is : what were croatia 's expectations ? 
   we had 4000 in one day at its peak and we listed everyone and gave asylum to everyone who asked . 
  you meant the [ ** temporary ** asylum ] ( http://inserbia.info/today/2015/08/over-4000-refugees-seeking-temporary-asylum-in-serbia ) for getting to the ~ ~ hungarian ~ ~ croatian border ? 
  this is a shite week , but i actually laughed at this . 
  we should have a thread to collect these sentences once things get calmer . 
  that would be awesome in a very cringe-worthy way . 
  yeah , my reaction exactly . 
  there are these ... \u00fcberhungarian , who are not just simply right wing sympathizers , but self entitled jesus christs of the modern world . 
  they adapt every religion , every magic to rise hungary above everyone 's head through their skewed rhetoric . 
  they are either too young , to have any experience about the world , and get swept away with these grand words , or old , tired , somewhat crazy , confused people , who either need help , or more help . 
  like i said , a clown . 
  by the way , i do n't think people here would see this a damaged relationship between our countries . 
  we do have clowns among our politicians too , and we see what actually happening around us . 
  to be honest , i 'm more concerned about the relationship with croatia and romania , especially with the latter . 
  i do n't want any old wound to be ripped open . 
  we are in this mess here and now , we do n't need any petty quarrel . 
  this would be the perfect time to bury the hatchet . 
  i know , i know !, 
  they are everywhere . 
  if you read/listen to them long enough , you will hear about the truth of jesus ' birth and origin , because he was born in the middle of hungary , and god himself gave this land to us ( and this is just a mild idea ) . 
  the cringe is way too strong with these ones . 
  that will teach us !, 
  so you asked for my opinion just to attack it ? 
  and how does the us fit in ? 
  i thought we were talking about how the * eastern european * countries , but particularly * hungary * ( located in eastern europe ) is not overwhelmingly atheist . 
  but i stand by my earlier opinion : while not everyone in ** hungary ** is religious , about half of the country is christian . 
  if you ask for my personal experience and opinion , i can tell you : yeah , for me the percentage seems correct . 
  religion here is not just a place to fit in . 
  people usually fit in there if they believe , but that is the point , not the other way around . 
  you do n't have to pretend to be religious to find company , but if you are , you can find one . 
  i do n't say that every single person in the query , who defined themselves christian is highly religious . 
  maybe they are just believe in god or something . 
  but i 'm pretty sure , if they are atheists , they are in the miscellaneous section . 
  i hope this made any sense . 
   not for the bbc it does n't , it 's funded by british tv owners . 
   it was as simple as one journalist not knowing what he 's talking about ignorance is not an excuse , but i 'm ready to forgive him . 
  man , journalists today ...  it was hardly enough to warrant an apology i would n't call slander `` hardly enough '' , but i 'm not a lawyer , or into law , so that is too just an opinion . 
  i still do n't agree with their lack of correct response , but i see and understand your point . 
   but what you do in response to those mistakes is what matters . 
  this is true when we are talking about organisations too . 
  you fuck up , you try to save face , but it really matters how . 
  `` we apologize for our earlier statement about x which turned out false . '', 
  here you get a picture about a company that knows humility , they may even gain popularity by honesty ( in this case : in an industry , where credibility and objectivity should be valued above all ) . 
  when you try to sweep everything under the rug as fast and quietly as possible after the damage has been done ... it does n't send the right message ( again , in this industry , where popularity pays the wages ) . 
  people make mistakes , yes . 
  but there are people , who should aim to make as less , as possible . 
  yeah , journalists are not surgeons , who make a little mistake , and their patients may die , or engineers , or builders , using faulty blueprints and materials to build dangerous buildings and vehicles , causing accidents . 
  my point is , sure , we are people , we err , but depending on our standing in the world , our accountability and responsibility differs . 
  if someone bears the noble and huge responsibility to educate and inform the masses , they should n't make this big mistakes . 
  one misstep can tarnish an entire organization , there is nothing new . 
   hungary for being atheistic wat . 
  granted , i 'm not religious myself , but according to ksh ( hungarian central statistical office ) in 2011 from 9 937 628 people 5 254 179 called themselves christian ( that 's about 53 % ) . 
  the rest is miscellaneous , but certainly not atheist . 
  ( [ source in hungarian , if anyone is interested ] ( http://www.ksh.hu/docs/hun/xftp/idoszaki/nepsz2011/nepsz_10_2011.pdf ) ), 
  the guy , who began the anti-anti-immigrant poster series in hungary months ago , made metric fuckton of these years before . 
  ( [ like these ] ( http://mkkp.hu/wordpress/?category_name=tablasodas ) ), 
  yeah , i heard about the elections , i really hope this guy is just a confused clown for his own sake . 
  this migrant crisis is not something easy to solve , to put it mildly , but faymann really does n't help , when he talks shit . 
  i am not angry at him ( at least not anymore ) , he actually began to amuse me . 
  kind of reminds me of gyurcs\u00e1ny ( who , by the way , did it again , popped out of nowhere , criticized everything , then got stuck in serbia ... man , that guy is hilarious ) . 
  i do n't think that mirroring germany is a bad thing to do . 
  let 's say , it 's working what they are doing : it will work for austria too . 
  if it does n't work , but there is a solution , then it will work in both cases . 
  if everything fails , ~ ~ you can blame gemany ~ ~ there will be one problem twice ( that needs one solution ) , than tons of other kind of shit . 
  yeah , i know , it 's way too easy to type it from a comfortable chair , without being accountable for anything . 
  i know the world does n't work like that , but it would be nice to believe it . 
  not really . 
  it will become ` poor helpless , desperate refugees ' . 
  us on the other hand ... are we public enemy yet ? 
  that guy is a clown . 
  i am sure , that austria has its own share in this mess , i do n't doubt it for a second . 
  but this guy ... he is a friggin clown . 
  everything he says ... like he blindly chooses prepared statements from a hat , or something . 
  awww fhit . 
    it 's not the owner 's money being spent , but the government 's . 
  maybe i should have chosen my words differently , because you 're right , that 's make more sense . 
  but it 's late , and i 'm tired , so i leave it alone . 
  so there is this building , that needs to be built , the owner meets the three contractors , a german , an englishman and a hungarian about the costs . 
  the german thinks for a while , does a little calculation , and says : 3 million euros . 
  one million for me , one million for the materials , one million to the workers . 
  the englishman thinks a little , then says : 6 million euros . 
  two million for me , two million for the materials , two to the workers . 
  the hungarian says without much thinking : 9 million euros . 
  the owner is stunned , why is it so much ?
