  the hungarian answers : 3 million for me , 3 million for you , and for 3 million we 'll hire the german . 
  then they can say , they have it like guantanamo . 
  because it 's not the correct form of his name . 
  it 's english , his name would be binyamin/benyamin/b \u00fcnyamin . 
   hungary is central-south . 
  woah at that `` south '' . 
  this is a first . 
   cicavec i so love this . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's not pronounced as i hope , but still funny . 
  i know this is tired cynicism , and that it 's not right , and it does n't represent you or me , your country or mine , but i laughed inside . 
  because of tired cynicism . 
  excuse me , but i am really confused right now . 
  what are you answering to ? 
  i never said that they had no reason . 
  heck , i never even said anything about them , aside that  these people never had to be discouraged about coming to hungary because , you know , they never wanted to come here . 
  so it 's pointless to discourage them ** if ** that 's what going on ( referring to the '' / s '' comment above ) . 
  i then said that germany is another question , and not because of some offhand comment from mutti merkel , but because these people originally had that country as their destination . 
  another story if some want to discourage these people coming to europe , again , referring to the comment above . 
  i heard some ** rumors ** about northern europe , that they intentionally try to discredit themselves , spread some bad reputation , so they will be avoided . 
  i do n't know whether it has some truth in it , or it is working , but i 'm pretty sure that these people never had to be discouraged about coming to hungary . 
  germany ? 
  well , that 's another story . 
   if they individually get a notification after six months they will have a much harder time to congregate and complain . 
  that is an interesting opinion , and i find myself agree with it . 
  the question is , when enough people will be disgruntled with this decision , will they gather `` their kin '' to be a mob ? 
  i do n't think that would be too hard for them , you know , six months are way too short for any kind of assimilation and integration ( thus these immigrants will be more ready to be in touch with each other during this time ) . 
  but this is just a question , let 's hope for the best . 
  woah , that escalated quickly . 
  it 's not about wanting them or not . 
  if they need help here , they can get help here . 
  but they do n't want to be here . 
  end of story . 
  oh , i found [ another ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/04/hundreds-refugees-march-austria-budapest-hungary-syrians ) :  but the carriages were halted less than half an hour after leaving the capital by security forces , who tried to move the refugees to a nearby processing camp . 
  for much of friday , they refused to budge , turning away offers of water , fruits and sweets and shouting `` no food !, 
  no food ! '' in protest . 
    `` the situation is so bad , '' said adnan shanan , 35 , from latakia in syria , who said he was fleeing war in his homeland . 
  `` we have many sick people on the train . 
  we have pregnant women , no food , no water . 
  we do n't need to stay here one more day . 
  we need to move on to munich , to anywhere else . 
  we ca n't stay here . 
  we ca n't wait until tomorrow . '' these two paragraph in this order . 
  i ca n't even . 
  there was [ this article ] ( http://www.thelocal.at/20150904/vienna-group-plans-refugee-convoy-to-hungary ) , that outright said : `` hungary is not a safe country '' . 
  no , i 'm sorry , i really ca n't overcome this sentence . 
  i seriously hope that no on the highway . 
  okay , so . 
  * the immigrants left the city at about 15:30 * the police wo n't stop them , but they are following them in about 10 police cars * the immigrants were/are offered water and fruits which they ~ ~ finally ~ ~ accepted * they said they do n't want to disturb traffic , but the crowd is way too big they are/were moving on the m7 motorway towards the m1 motorway , which leads to austria . 
   hungary is not a safe country wow . 
  i should be extra careful then going home . 
  i really am curious what will happen to these poor souls at the border . 
  i hope the best for them , but somehow i think it wo n't be this easy . 
  i live in budapest , and so far the only thing that directly affected my life is that [ yesterday at about 5:30 15-20 police cars were rushing to k\u00f6ki ] ( http://www.police.hu/hirek-es-informaciok/legfrissebb-hireink/kozrendvedelem/kozlemeny-10 ) . 
  give it time , i feel a punchline coming . 
  edit : oh wait , [ i found it . 
  ] ( http://hvg.hu/itthon.bunugy/20150831_kovel_dobaltak_embercsempeszek_a_rendorok ) translation : human traffickers had thrown rocks at police cars , and shouted that the police wo n't let them work . 
  do n't worry , if we are looking very hard , maybe we will find somebody . 
  people , who really stand out . 
  hmmm ... maybe ... luxembourg !, 
  fuck those cunts !, 
  ^ / s ^ obviously, 
  indeed it is . 
  i try to gather my wits and some source . 
  * the company is called mastermobilker kft . 
  ( founded in 2011 ) , they bought the once slovakian truck * it has a z - [ number ] licence plate , that means it 's temporary , the truck had been sold to abroad , various paperwork is pending * it is said to be bought by a romanian guy , but it is yet to be confirmed * mastermobilker 's profile also includes the processing of wood , construction materials , sanitary equipment , automotive repair , maintenance , well-being goods ( ah , i do n't really have a good word for this ) , restaurant , mobile food . 
  * internet search for address of the hungarian owner shows a farm near kecskem\u00e9t ( who also had several smaller , usually failing business around lake balaton ) * the new owner ( since may ) is an ukrainian born , ukrainian living guy , his hungarian representative supposedly lives in pet\u0151fisz\u00e1ll\u00e1s ( village about halfway between kecskem\u00e9t and szeged ) * the company 's income in 2013 was 308m huf , there is no data from 2014 * the company 's main address houses tons of other companies , but upon inquire ( mostly mail ) , they are said to be moved elsewhere * four people were arrested by the police , three of them bulgarian and one from afghanistan ^ ^ i ^ ^ hope ^ ^ while ^ ^ i ^ ^ typed ^ ^ all ^ ^ this , ^ ^ somebody ^ ^ else ^ ^ beat ^ ^ me . 
  there were 71 dead in that truck . 
  ( hungarian article : http://hvg.hu/vilag/20150828_71_halott_menekultekkel_teli_kamion ) roughly a translation : the truck was sold about 1-2 years ago to a hungarian company ( that in my opinion does/did some shady business in the past , i 'll try to get an article or something ) , the licence plate is temporary . 
  more information should be provided in a couple hours . 
  not just that , this :  also , if the potential workforce grows , so will the amount of jobs . 
  was good too . 
  if this was a working analogy , then there would be no unemployment ever . 
  i gladly share your worldview , you are right , we have to learn from the mistakes . 
  pray tell , how would you solve this problem ? 
   at least one european leader who really protects his people . 
    who really protects his people   protects hah !, 
  that one was good !, 
  while i agree that the fence may not be a bad idea ( at least it * is * an idea ) , orb\u00e1n does n't want to protect `` his '' people . 
  he merely wants to protect his own ( and his bootlickers ' / family 's ) position in power . 
  that 's why the posters are in hungarian , and that 's why there are communism-like self-idolizing propaganda all over the place . 
  oh , [ fruit soup ] ( http://www.nosalty.hu/kereses/recept/gy%c3%bcm%c3%b6lcsleves ) , the best thing in the summer !, 
  it can be made of fresh fruit , but compot is the best , since it 's already boiled and soft . 
  it can be made to be sweet or sour , with or without milk , and have to be cool or cold . 
  you can use almost any kind of fruit , and it 's insanely easy to make . 
  we had our belene too , but siberia was the ultimate punishment with some [ little work ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forced_labor_of_hungarians_in_the_soviet_union ) . 
   cattle in every home !, 
  and if you try to breed it with your fellow comrade 's cattle , both of your family will be deported to siberia for trying to disrupt the system by stealing property from the people . 
  all hail ~ ~ r\u00e1kosi ~ ~ ~ ~ stalin ~ ~ zhivkov !, 
  ^ ^ ^ we ^ ^ ^ are ^ ^ ^ talking ^ ^ ^ about ^ ^ ^ bulgaria ^ ^ ^ after ^ ^ ^ all . 
  big deal . 
  [ we came from even further . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_martians_\\ ( group \\ ) ), 
   oh did i told you they set fire to castle ? 
  yea , they were illegally cutting wood in the near by forest fucked up , grass near castle catched fire and it spread into castle . 
  sad day . 
  are you talking about krasna horka , or was there an other one ? 
   but they are basically dead for the other roma people . 
  they are traitors in theirs eyes . 
  in hungary the `` king of the gypsies '' ( or voivode ) is still a thing , and for a long time he really held authority over the romani . 
  but once he tried to actively reform their lives and call them out on their behaviour , he was ignored , and/or called a traitor .
