  this reminds me a gypsy couple in my village . 
  at one point they sold their house to an other family , who stripped it of ... heck , everything . 
  they burned the fence in winter . 
  they cut down the cherry tree , that stood in the garden to burn it . 
  the garden itself was a jungle . 
  there was junk everywhere , and they lived in the middle of it . 
  years later the now old couple moved back . 
  they rebuilt the fence , cleaned out the garden , now it 's a neat little vegetable garden . 
  they repaired the house , and while the contrast is not stunning , it 's still remarkable . 
  this couple sometimes fits in the stereotypes , but the difference between the two families is still great . 
  i see why people would convert to islam , the religion itself is far from being bad or evil ( moreover according to certain interpretation it actually seems quite good ) , but willingly going to war in a different country , from a peaceful , relatively rich and modern place is just insane !, 
   but over the hatred of something else - the govt now only one question remains . 
  when will we say `` that was enough '' ? 
  i seriously doubt that there will be anything anytime soon . 
  i doubt that people have any idea how to `` make things better '' in any sense , i doubt that they even have the will to do anything . 
  we make counter billboards , we mock the government and his majesty , king orb\u00e1n , we let off some steam , and things go back the way they were . 
   ( have no idea how they get the egg out of them ) it is very easy : you get a needle , make small holes on the egg 's top and bottom , and you blow its contents out . 
  then you have to wash it out , and dry it , otherwise it will began to rot . 
  when i was a kid we made tons of these easter eggs . 
  of course they were not this beautiful , because of children hands , and these `` eggpainting professionals '' have specialized tools we obviously lacked . 
  so this is guy , whom after the academy was named . 
  i feel like lugosi . 
  god , that guy had some thick accent . 
  yessss , i 've been waiting for this !, 
  happy friendship day guys !, 
  oooooooh , do you remember [ the meme ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/hummers-in-lake-balaton ) ? 
   here 's a trireme olympias this must has been the worst slideshow i ever saw . 
  also wololo . 
  thanks . 
  i must be retarded that i did n't find them . 
   why not eus europa ? 
  i wanted something along the lines of `` europa 's daughter/son '' , but my google-fu did n't come up with anything . 
  i choose the two second best . 
  zeus as the god , who brought europa to the isle of crete ( but we know that ) , and asterion , her then-husband ( * i * did n't know this ) . 
   lots of arms ok , then eus hekatonkheir !, 
  or we build three ships , and we call them the hekatonkheires : eus briareos , eus cottus and eus gyges . 
  ^ ^ wow ^ ^ this ^ ^ escalated ^ ^ quickly . 
   uss europe maybe eus zeus ? 
  give it a greek name . 
  sci-fi loves greek names . 
  you know , for our american friends . 
  ( in a free country , a free man from his free will can say and do anything that is permitted . ), 
  welcome to the modern world , where normal people have rights , obligations and accountability . 
  dat vud b\u00ed `` d\u00f6 '' , vudnt it ? 
  hungarian , as always , comes from `` s\u00f3\u00f6\u00fcihug\u0151p\u00fc\u00f6 '' proto-uralic word . 
  it 's barely similar , dammit !, 
  i know , right ? 
  budapest , hungary ( ... ) following the refugee crisis this is so last year , and still , every source painted ( and as it seems , still paint ) the city as your average clusterfuck warzone . 
  apparently i live in hell , hungary , ama . 
  so yeah , i take this article with a tablespoon of salt . 
  i 'd say , germany , please do change , because another couple of discussions like this , and i 'll seriously doubt my sanity . 
  of course , yeah . 
  even the way they are now , they fulfill the three most important thing i would seek in any apartment : they are clean , warm and safe . 
  and looking at [ these beds ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/12/03/300ccc6800000578-3394917-image-a-29_1452568888559.jpg ) , they seem moderately comfortable too . 
   they are then shut in to their containers overnight -- ten people to a container , ** no windows ** . 
  search `` calais container '' . 
  switch to pictures . 
  [ yeah , sure , no windows . 
  ] ( http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/10325/production/_87714366_030878725-1.jpg ) what i think about all this : these containers are not the ritz , not some permanent residences , but that 's the point !, 
  these are temporary , but more dignified shelter than the mud-ghetto the migrants occupy . 
  also , these containers are :  converted shipping containers , fitted with electricity , heating and bunk beds . 
  [ ( source ) ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35322374 ) dear bristol 24/7 , you are very welcome to bring those to eastern europe , i 'm pretty sure that the poor and homeless here wo n't complain . 
  ^ edit : ^ added ^ source . 
  since i came to elte last semester , i ca n't say much , but when i asked the teacher about c++ and regex , he went quiet for a while , said something about 11 , and that 's it . 
  i suppose that was telling . 
  also he was talking about macroing ( granted , in the context of it 's being old ) . 
  and while my profs in debrecen were n't the prime example of pure teacher material ^ tm , at least we were working on computers . 
  and the delays : if it 's anything like de , then of fucking course . 
  hah , thanks , good to know . 
  bme does n't do pti , that i began a half century ago in debrecen . 
  elte on the other hand ... and i have so mixed feelings about this arrangement : i finished two courses last semester , and the level of the education seems better here than in de , but everything else ... man , the day before yesterday we had c++ class , you know , the practice kind ( nincs j\u00f3 szavam r\u00e1 , gyarkorlat volt no ) , without any computers . 
  i was like wat . 
  granted , the class itself was good , but still . 
  i really hope you 're right , because halfway through my cs education i begin to think i 'm just wasting money on the uni . 
  the article clearly says net income . 
   ~ 530 $ my question is : where do people get this kind of money , and how do i get there ? 
  imagine that your native language is an agglutinating one . 
  where you have one word , that have to be expressed by several others in english . 
  now imagine a sentence with these long words in it that you have to translate . 
  okay , i do n't like these bilingual posts , and i think i have a reason why . 
  when the closest related language to your own is still further to you than a moon crater to the chicken 's feet , you really feel alienated reading a language you ca n't even vaguely understand ( without background knowledge of course ) . 
  i really appreciate that we all have different culture and language , but it 's better to feel to be the part of something big , than that the fact that we are kind of outsiders being rubbed under our noses in this way . 
  of course it 's just my opinion , i do n't know about others . 
  no , these are no ikea names , there are no \u00fcml\u00e4\u00fcts . 
  i think they sound like some fantasy german-english town , with fantasy-steampunk setting . 
  i already can see the transportation between swellish and lamaling . 
  we also do n't speak about saymalin , their grand duke is rather hostile , and willing to attack any trade route between the two cities with their flying boats . 
  ^ okay , ^ i 'm ^ done ^ now . 
  / r/foundtheprogrammer, 
  thanks . 
  okay , i 'll be honest : i 'm not entirely convinced about all this ( when the picture is from [ this site ] ( https://ishtarsgate.wordpress.com/ ) ) , but i also think there are staged ( be them prepared or spontaneous ) pictures and videos . 
  like the guy , who dragged his family on the railway tracks last year . 
   there 's already been a couple pictures of these kinds of situations being staged forgive my suspicion , but source ? 
  oh , i see , that 's a relief . 
  [ does mounted archery counts ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mounted_archery ), 
   he is still liked and respected but erdogan is doing a good job of changing it in the long run . 
  that 's a shame , but it 's not surprising . 
  they say : history written by the victors , ^ ^ ^ \\ ( i 'd ^ ^ ^ like ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ feel ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ unwritten ^ ^ ^ pun ^ ^ ^ here ^ ^ ^ flow ^ ^ ^ through ^ ^ ^ you ) but i think it 's more like history is written by those , who are currently in power . 
   depends on which type of turk you ask .
