  yeah , i really should have thought this . 
  i hope he wo n't go full putin , with the worship and everything . 
  even the situation with our `` vikt\u00e1tor '' is not that bad . 
  ^ ^ ^ \\ ( yet . ), 
  i have some questions , if it 's okay . 
   modern turkey was founded by atat\u00fcrk to me , he ( or at least his influence ) seems very appealing , but is/was he liked by turks too ? 
  it would seem so because of his nickname , but then again , any dictator can be called `` glorious leader '' or `` father of everything beautiful '' , or shit like this . 
  if he was liked , how is he viewed today ? 
   when erdogan ceme into the power , and especially the recent years , things changed a bit . 
  again , for me his way seems very backwards . 
  i 'll be honest , i do n't know too much about him , he very well can be a turkish orb\u00e1n ( you know , a charismatic political joke , sometimes right , more often wrong , a broken clock can show the right time twice a day ) . 
  how is he viewed ? 
  are people generally agree with him ? 
  as i said , things seem to be degrading , but do turkish people think this too ? 
  okay , since the article is pointing at us , i feel like contributing . 
  the borders are not closed . 
  if you have a valid passport and/or you are a member of a schengen country , and you try to cross at a control point during opening hours , you can pass . 
  you know , like in a normal , non-european country . 
  ( [ source ] ( http://www.police.hu/english/border-information/border-crossing ) )  a ** closed border ** is a border that prevents movement of people between different jurisdictions with ** limited or no exceptions ** associated with this movement . 
  these borders normally have fences or walls in which any gates or border crossings are closed and if these border gates are opened they generally only allow movement of people in ** exceptional circumstances ** . 
  perhaps the most famous example of an extant closed border is the demilitarized zone between north korea and south korea . 
  the berlin wall could also have been called a closed border . 
  ( [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/open_border ) ) for example the [ us-mexican border ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mexico%e2%80%93united_states_border ) is not a closed border , and neither is hungary 's southern border . 
  i really hope it wo n't come to that , i do n't wish it anybody , but remember , when faymann said something similar about austria , fences still were built . 
  and i myself feel like this whole madhouse is a long marriage : only death will do us part . 
  ^ i ^ really ^ * am * ^ * not * ^ happy ^ with ^ this . 
  [ very relevant polandball comic ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jrysoog.png ), 
   if we only compare violent crimes , the left is often worse than the right . 
  i have at least an image about the modern extreme right 's crimes , and/or methods , but i seriously have no clue about the modern extreme left 's crimes . 
  could you please elaborate what you mean when you say the latter is more violent than the former ? 
  now kiss !, 
  that was terrifying , until i remembered [ what we do to our verbs ] ( http://wikiszotar.hu/igeragozasok_tablazatos.html ) . 
  if i remember correctly , dream.net once was an all-time low on imdb . 
  i ( luckily ) have n't seen it ... 
  i saw someone , who had , and made a review of it . 
  gawd , my eyes !, 
  which was the bestest thing in ... maybe all my childhood . 
  every summer sunday evenings were spent in front of the tv . 
  this was n't a pathetic attempt to shame people to amuse others . 
  we loved the contestants , and we were proud of them . 
  beautiful , beautiful times . 
  also , after 15 years , there is another series , very much like this . 
  edit : okay , found it : http://www.intervilles.com/ ( french site ), 
   `` but when i marry , my wife will be a housekeeper who will cook the food i like - and she certainly wo n't go to discos . '', 
  good luck with that , mate . 
  with this mindset , you will need it . 
   behead her i. . . what ? 
  for real ? 
  do these people get some kind of penalty , like ... marked for deportation , or something ? 
  i 'd ask `` why '' , but it 's too satisfying to watch . 
  we have `` steampunk '' , `` cyberpunk '' , but your movie would definitely go under `` trashpunk '' . 
  reminds me of lunik 9 in kosice . 
  i get an eye cancer just * thinking * about it . 
  this reminds me szolnok . 
  szolnok is like [ this ] ( http://info.szolnok.hu/userfiles/images/egy%c3%a9b/k%c3%a9p%20601_vagott.jpg ) , [ this ] ( https://sunnywalk64.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/kossuth-ter.jpg ) , and [ this ] ( http://www.tiszaligetkft.hu/images/szolnok/szolnok_kossuth_tr.jpg ) , but it was a big ( if not the biggest ) soviet city in hungary , so there are places like [ hotel pelik\u00e1n ] ( http://egykor.hu/images/2010/original/szolnok-hotel-pelikan-2009.jpg ) ( when my mother was a kid , she used to look forward when it would be finished ) . 
  but even with everything considered , i ca n't hate this place , when it has this [ surreal ] ( http://www.blogszolnok.hu/tiny_mce/uploaded/helyszinelo/2013/13-bowling2.jpg ) [ retrofuturistic ] ( http://www.blogszolnok.hu/tiny_mce/uploaded/1xvolt/utcasorolo/13-jubileum7.jpg ) [ charm ] ( http://www.karpat-medence.hu/keptar/galleries/magyarorszag/jasz-nagykun-szolnok/szolnok/vasutallomas/szolnok-vasutallomas_07.jpg ) . 
  ugh , do n't even remind me . 
  all those long , old poems . 
  suddenly '' \u00e1lmodb\u00f3l felk\u00f6ltve is '' got a nightmarish turn . 
  it was confirmed by his son too . 
  i agree , this is unfair , he seemed so ... immortal . 
  especially when you count that it was hungarian territory till 1918 . 
  oh , i have a dutch friend , who learns hungarian , and understands this and that when we talk in hungarian . 
  his best `` wat '' moment was when we said `` tiszta kosz '' . 
  he understood `` tiszta '' as clean , and `` kosz/koszos '' as dirt/dirty , so this `` clean dirt '' was something really strange for him . 
  like i said `` a sound like ` gy ' '' . 
  no , it is n't ` gy ' , of course it is n't . 
  but it 's similar . 
  my favorite things are our double consonants . 
  they are not exactly easy to learn , so people always have problems with them . 
  for example a sound like ` gy ' is in ` imme ** di ** ately ' , anyone can pronounce it , but they lose their shit , when ` gy ' is in a name like ` gyula ' . 
  i think it would be cool if the v4 send some help . 
  on the other hand it could be exploited in many ways . 
  `` slovenia , would you like to join our club ? 
  we sent help ! '', 
  or `` slovenia , how could you accept candy from the bogieman ? 
  is the embrace of the eu not good anymore ? '', 
  if it 's true , which i highly doubt . 
  woah , you just described my high school 's math and physics classes ( when we went to advanced math class in high school , the teacher just stared us , when we told him we do n't know shit ) . 
  we got sorted by our knowledge in languages too . 
  in our second year of high school we got german as second foreign language ( we could n't choose , i wanted latin too ! ) . 
  thus the class was divided ... in four actually . 
  some english , more german , some german more english , good at both , and at neither . 
  i think that language teaching should n't be about quantity with force , but quality with inspiration . 
  if i were an english teacher for example , i 'd bring my kids to subtitled movies regularly . 
  would dissect lyrics , read `` hip '' books in english , things like these . 
  when i learned more than just basic statistics ( as part of my cs studies ) , we 've been told , and could realize : statistics can be bought . 
  it 's not about `` how many % of x is y '' but rather `` how many x should i get that has certain % of y '' . 
  but i 'm telling this to a statistician ( a mediocre one tho ) . 
  also , a [ hungarian hard candy ] ( http://reklamipar.hu/uploads/images/nol_hu.jpg ) is called negro too ( named after a guy , not colors or anything ) . 
  and while we are here : `` n\u00e9ger '' is not an offensive word in hungarian . 
  calling someone black however is not so pc ... 
  i do n't know , i had a decent to awesome english education in school ( both elementary and high school ) . 
  and of course you will learn much more from games and tv , you are more interested in you hobby than school . 
  he should study way much more than just history . 
  i 'm not sure about other hungarian school , but the one i was attending as a teen had a `` basic '' math and an advanced math . 
  ( little background : high school consists of 3-4 years , and math is a requirement in these years , so there is no `` i have literature and history subjects , i do n't need math '' timetables ) so at basic math this is about a mid to high grade problem , you are supposed to learn these in your 2nd-3rd year , and positively practice it before an exam . 
  these type of problems can be difficult , but challenging ? 
  at advanced level this is easy . 
  i learned integration and derivation in my last year of high school , but then again , i 've been learning advanced math ever since .
