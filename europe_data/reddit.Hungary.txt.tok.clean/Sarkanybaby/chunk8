  :d yeah , you have to practice * r\u00edmfarag\u00e1s * . 
   flemish - magyar , bros if meet ,  fight together , and drink much beer . 
  while there was significant monetary compensation , most of the participating police officers ( at least those higher up on the food chain ) were promoted . 
  well , thinking back , [ it was pretty brutal ] ( http://index.hu/nagykep/2016/10/22/2006_oktober_23._egy_veres_nap_kronikaja/ ) ( hungarian article , mostly pictures ) . 
  october is the hungarian spring , it gets everybody in a revolutionary mood . 
  if you are interested , [ this ] ( http://www.budapestbylocals.com/hungarian-goulash.html ) is what a goulash is really like . 
  i think that most ingredients are very basic , except paprika and paprika paste , i do n't know if you can and how you get anything like those . 
  ( i 'm not familiar with other countries ' grocery stores ' supply . ), 
  ] ( http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/pork-recipes/spicy-pork-and-chilli-pepper-goulash/ ) okay , i do n't usually have problems about people using oil instead of lard ( though in really makes difference in certain dishes ) , or this minor spice instead of that , but seriously ? 
  rice ? 
  so answering your unsaid question : this guy must really want to have a proper trashing . 
  we have a joke in hungary : promise is a beautiful word , but landwirtschaftsausstellung is even more beautiful . 
  i only saw parts of it in a yt video , but oh my god , it was bad . 
  roma lives are idealized , all whites are inherently evil . 
  it does n't try to tackle the problem of racism , it makes it worse ( thank god that the `` movie '' is not widely known ) . 
  it generalizes this black-and-white stereotype , and this is just the tip of the iceberg . 
  as i understand the acting , dialogues are also awful themselves . 
   diana groo ( ... ) said : `` the campaign of hatred reminds me very much of the nazi propaganda ( ... ) . 
  it does remind us of the 1930s . '' i just ca n't take seriously the words of the director , who made [ vespa ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1516598 ) . 
  water inside you radiator and from the tap are two different things . 
  the former must be a closed ( and full ) system to work properly . 
  if you hear a gurgle , it means that the radiator is leaking somewhere and/or there is air in the system , thus it ca n't be heated up properly . 
  do n't worry , my res has night vision , i do n't even notice `` normal '' changes . 
  on the bright side : budapest !, 
   also : [ help_reddit_turned_spanish ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/cq1q2/help_reddit_turned_spanish_and_i_cannot_undo_it/ ) i am so saving this . 
  does even reddit have a museum of epic threads or something ? 
  the protesters are tilting at windmills , at least here in europe . 
  '' ... it talks '' ? 
  i can picture a blm movement in hungary : `` we protest here for the better lives of hungary 's ... one-two-three-four ... 12 black citizen ! '', 
  it sure changes . 
  gets worse . 
  i think the problem is that they kind of encourage the spread of ignorance , and i as a human being , whose species worked * really * hard in the last couple thousand years to achieve what they did , i resent this . 
  i 'll ask again respectfully : do you , or do you not have any sources ? 
   hungary is the prime example for far right wing and fascists how ? 
   centrists and left wingers in the west defend you when ? 
   we paid you billions why ? 
   allowed your people to move here how and where ? 
   all you did is abuse it and turn to fascism how exactly ? 
  i am seriously curious about your answers . 
  meh , to be honest , i do n't really care about that . 
  we , as a country always were sitting on this infamy roller coaster . 
  i 'm more bothered about dissing the eastern half of europe . 
  that really does n't help with mending fences in the eu . 
  wow , this is the nth comment from you against hungary in this thread . 
  so you are either * a hungarian , and you really perfected the `` hungarians are their own worst enemy '' mentality * were wronged by hungarians , in this case i 'm sincerely sorry * closet-xenophobic ( do n't worry , i tolerate intolerance ) also  hungary turned fascist long before the refugee crisis . 
  i 'll need citation on this . 
   they are n't contributing anything . 
  and this . 
   what did slovakia and eastern europe ever contribute ? 
  and also this . 
  you really must have some stable and credible source , if you are so determined to kick half europe out of the continent . 
  the problem is , you see , that fb has ( or * had * , it seems ) this idea about being a news source . 
  but how can you be a news source if you do n't allow critical discussion ? 
  the '90s called , they wanted their website back . 
  hundreds of years in hungarian history was spent fighting for freedom against the mongol empire/austria/ottoman empire/wwi/wwii / soviets , and rarely with positive results for the country . 
  thousands of pieces of literature was born during these times , heroic before a battle , broken after them . 
  being gloomy is not a new thing , and i 'm pretty sure there was always a `` bezzeg r\u00e9gen '' reminiscing . 
  and people wonder why we have this sour cynical humour . 
  we either overthink it , and get depressed , or laugh at it somehow . 
  we use `` n\u00e9ni '' for an old woman , it 's kind of an endearing word . 
  `` mama '' in this case is a bit rude . 
  fun fact : in hungary the word `` n\u00e9ger '' does n't have any offensive meaning . 
  it can be considered as a translation for `` black person '' , though nowadays it 's less used . 
  `` fekete '' or `` feket\u00e9k '' ( black and blacks respectively ) on the other hand ... 
   http://hungarianfreepress.com  wordpress engine yup , seems like a legit news source . 
   ovejuk \u00f6v\u00e9k  edit : spelling , thanks / u/sarkanybaby edit : meh , it does n't make that much difference . 
  pretty sure as much , as we understand finnish . 
  not a single word . 
  i 've built this kingdom up from nothing . 
  when i started here , all there was was swamp . 
  all the kings said i was daft to build a castle in a swamp , but i built it all the same , just to show 'em . 
  it sank into the swamp . 
  so , i built a second one . 
  that sank into the swamp . 
  so i built a third one . 
  that burned down , fell over , then sank into the swamp . 
  but the fourth one stayed up . 
  an ' that 's what your gon na get , lad -- the biggest money pit in these islands . 
  & nbsp ; ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ really ^ ^ ^ am ^ ^ ^ sorry . 
  well , there is moly.hu for a. . . multiplayer experience . 
  or know more about that 4chan guy . 
   he prepares the visit of pm viktor orb\u00e1n . 
  i do n't like the sound of this . 
  well , we have a saying that describes extra strong paprika as `` it burns twice . '', 
   ( magor and attila were brothers though ) you mean hunor and magor . 
  yes , finally !, 
  who needs an enemy , when you have a hungarian for a friend !, 
  also , i hope you know [ the joke about hungarians in hell ] ( http://viccek24.hu/viccek/ustok ) . 
  edit : i think i got misinterpreted . 
  i meant that we hone again the good old hungarian national hobby ^ tm , find a hungarian , and accuse them being `` libsi '' / traitor/fascist/orange / green/red/whatever . 
  we are our worst enemies . 
  can we please cut it out ? 
   he probably ~ ~ uses ~ ~ wants to use fear of migrants to stay in power i would n't worry about this . 
  unless you are a really shortsighted `` ultrarightwinger '' hungarian , you wo n't eat up all his shit . 
  i think he ( sometimes ) seems reasonable on the international scene , but complete bonkers on the national one . 
  the question should be : which one is him ? 
  bless you !, 
  ^ ( ^ the ^ more ^ i ^ hear ^ these ^ `` exits '' ^ the ^ more ^ i ^ find ^ them ^ ridiculous . ), 
  well , orb\u00e1n certainly does n't want to pull it out . 
  also it is the highest blaw-knox tower ever built .
