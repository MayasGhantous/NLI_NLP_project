  something like ... kov\u00e1cs p\u00e9ter . 
  we also have one ( though i think it 's not a recurring theme here , if we count the puns out ) , [ `` k\u0151m\u00edves kelemen ballad\u00e1ja '' ] ( http://puszta.com/eng/hungary/cikk/befalazott_asszony_1 ) . 
  yeah , i 'm pretty sure i saw the picture before ( also , i think there is a `` not budapest '' version to ) , but the design is still questionable . 
  edit : [ here it is . 
  ] ( http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/7c/3b/3d/7c3b3d989c7a9033331881c474eb7634.jpg ) must has been a joint project . 
  / r/dontdeadopeninside well ... maybe not . 
  `` welcome to nem bukarest '' and `` not bucharest k\u00f6sz\u00f6nti \u00f6nt '' both would mean the same . 
  ouch on many levels . 
  thanks !, 
  i wonder if the eu would take a step against our great and benevolent leader . 
  maybe something better than a stern letter ... ? 
  hungarian people , a question . 
  when did orb\u00e1n 's orange become orb\u00e1n 's blue ? 
  to be honest , we do n't like it either . 
  aww no , god !, 
  thinking of them just gave me a brain aneurysm . 
  hmm , you must be right , i have to remember this . 
  how do you know if a politician is lying ? 
  his mouth moves . 
  ^ ( ^ ^ please ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ hurt ^ ^ me . ), 
  fucking finally !, 
  also , paywall . 
  i know very well that i should n't feed the trolls , but here is the thing about the crosses : - the crown is our holy crown , has a wast history , still is our most precious treasure , also it 's the very symbol of our country - the double cross on the coat of arms means saint stephen , his reign and his influence ( you know , our first king ) similar coat of arms were used during our biggest revolutions , are behind noble minds and ideas , so it simply does n't represent a religion . 
  it represents our roots , our history , our land , freedom and future . 
  i 'm pretty sure we do n't just disguise it . 
  we were pessimistic long before the 20th century . 
  it 's hungaricum . 
  you mean the leaning cross ? 
  when i first heard about fassbender , i was like `` heh , i wo n't fall for it '' . 
  the `` bender '' part was okay , my brain translated it obediently , but for `` fass '' ... it provided the hungarian word . 
  fasz . 
  dick . 
  still difficult to unsee mr `` dick-bender '' . 
  the  omg guys , you have way too much national guilt , grow some balls !!!, 
  ! 11 vs  we ca n't leave you alone , you are literally hitler !, 
  opinions of the past years are just ridiculous . 
  now i wonder which came first . 
  cut the germans some slack already !, 
  my nightmare fuel were [ these guys . 
  `` make love , not war '' got a new meaning . 
  also , 2205 : that 's no moon , that 's a telescope !, 
  mfw i realize it 's not the netherlands . 
  also , mfw i realize it 's actually hungary . 
  but now that i think about it ... [ yeah ] ( http://vilagbiztonsag.hu/keptar/albums/userpics/10007/minta_004.jpg ) , [ it does ] ( http://pctrs.network.hu/clubpicture/1/2/6/6/_/tulipanos_lada_1266428_4269.jpg ) [ make ] ( http://www.kopjafa.hu/galeria_3/kopjafa_fafaragas_20.jpg ) [ sense ] ( http://polomania.hu/images/designs/tn3/579710315513f127091218.jpg ) . 
  programming . 
  no , i just wrote down what i read on the internet , though i 'm familiar with making both wine and spirits . 
  in a lab , i suppose yes , you 'd need a special solution ( like sodium carbonate ) to remove water from alcohol . 
  like i said , wine . 
  wine , in a nutshell , is fermented fruit , pressed in a [ wine press ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wine_press ) , the liquid you get ( called * must * ) needs more fermentation and aging , and bwam , wine . 
  of course it 's not this easy , you may need sugar or other chemicals during the manufacturing , but basically this is it . 
  [ distillation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/distillation ) is an entirely different process , that also begins with fermented fruit , but it does n't involve pressing . 
  also , there is no such thing as 100 % alcohol , the highest is 96 % . 
  that it 's distilled and not pressed ( like wike ) , or brewed ( like beer ) . 
  pure alcohol is clear and colorless , and highly flammable . 
  i sometimes use `` komp\u00e9r '' too . 
  but my most guilty pleasure in our language is pal\u00f3c . 
  i still say `` menek '' instead of `` megyek '' , or `` mehhalok '' instead of `` meghalok '' . 
  it 's not always intentional , and i 'm not sure whether i should stop it , or embrace it . 
  from heves . 
  i realize that the k\u00e1d\u00e1r cube is * very * widespread , and of course there are many of them here too , but we have `` normal '' houses too . 
  ^ also , ^ i ^ * may * ^ be ^ a ^ little ^ bit ^ too ^ biased , ^ i 've ^ never ^ even ^ set ^ a ^ foot ^ into ^ one ^ of ^ these ^ houses . 
  ^ i ^ grew ^ up ^ in ^ a ^ pre-war ^ building . 
  not necessarily . 
  where i come from for example , there are more old peasant homes than cube houses . 
  i guess it 's difficult to build cubes on uneven ground . 
  not really , no , it does n't mean anything in hungarian . 
  it refers to krasna horka castle . 
  more like kras-na-hor-ka-ee . 
   stuff like sandwiches especially deep-fried meat sandwiches . 
  i wanted to say this , but i thought we 'd outgrown this . 
  apparently not . 
  we have those kind of ... well , cheese too . 
  we call it `` lapkasajt '' , [ it looks like this ] ( http://users.atw.hu/kepekszoveggel/020pizza/1280/007sajt.jpg ) , has nothing in common with mozzarella ( or with cheese in general ) , and tastes like rubber . 
  yeah , the picture was taken on a dull autumn day . 
  even around the soviet flats usually there is plenty greenery . 
  that peasant house is refurbished , of course their condition is very much depending on the money people are willing to spend on them . 
  but yeah , those houses look like that , or very similar . 
  also , [ these are the after-war houses ] ( http://gizmodo.com/the-somber-history-behind-these-wild-looking-cube-house-1625299696 ) in villages , if you are interested . 
  i think , [ this picture ] ( http://images.ingatlantajolo.hu/user_61108/ad_4623038/elado-panellakas-budapest-xix-kerulet-kispest-lakotelep-44834516-k0.jpg ) pretty much sums up the hungarian suburbs . 
  of course there 's variation in size and age , but generally they follow this pattern you see . 
  ( if you are not talking about special cases like [ wekerletelep ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/4417563.jpg ) in budapest or [ traditional peasant homes ] ( http://keptar.oszk.hu/031000/031027/1297153994_nagykep.jpg ) in rural areas , and such . ), 
  let 's call it krasznahorkay force , and count the broken tongues . 
  oh no , i very much agree , at least , with most of these points . 
  we need controlled borders , period . 
  to be honest , i 'm torn between the open doors policy , and supporting the fence we have . 
  i 'd be glad to help people who need it , but if they do n't even want it ( or god forbid , complain about it ) , then gtfo . 
  but labeling a politicians like orb\u00e1n sane is not good . 
  i know , you said ee in general , but he was said to be a hero once . 
  dear western europeans , who once thought that orb\u00e1n is a hero !, 
  please , do n't . 
  i am , we are not proud of him , and even less proud of the fact that i can not think of any way to kick him into the sun . 
  i 'm not sure that i should be happy that you have faith in us , or cry , because you 're wrong . 
  i was positively surprised , when i realized , that you can buy there wooden shoes that not purely ornamental and/or tourist traps . 
  as if you 'd visit an agricultural shop in hungary to buy a. . . gumicsizma . 
  `` shut up about trianon ! '', 
  would either get the `` but only a noisy minority is really butthurt about this '' response , or that * noisy minority 's * one . 
  yeah , hungarian is pretty much like this . 
  with a bunch of other rules and exceptions . 
  let 's see an example . 
  - * d\u00e9l-afrika * means south africa - but * d\u00e9l-afrikai k\u00f6zt\u00e1rsas\u00e1g * means the `` republic of south africa '' .
