beautiful women . 
  as would hungarian . 
  we are related but not that close . 
  vladolf, 
  wow , more than half of all finno-ugric speakers are hungarian . 
  bulgarian, 
  we have a lot of loan words , but we are not related . 
  everyone still complains about trianon, 
  hungarian is also related , but not to the point where we can understand each other . 
  szekler land is not dangerous, 
  1 - make berlusconi , orban and putin dictators of all europe 2-create ministry of silly walks 3-change official language to backwards spoken welsh, 
  [ we also have some ] ( http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/wiki/images/0/00/roundabout_sign_-_coppermine_-_14511.jpg ), 
  revise trianon . 
  on second thought , we will have putin do that for us . 
  that or union with finland and estonia . 
  better and . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.unitravel.hu/images/945/uni_945_4429.jpg ) is from landlocked hungary . 
  edit : no it is not . 
  if it is not , i will eat my hat . 
  general insult . 
  revise trianon . 
  its sad but true . 
  lofasz a seggedbe or , `` a horse dick into your arse '', 
  all while your cousins in central europe are getting closer and closer to putin ... 
  [ we did get some helicopters from you in 2011 . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_air_force#aircraft_inventory ), 
  looks quite similar to where i used to live in budapest . 
  why not also reverse trianon . 
  [ hungary is always forgotten ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/ikarus_280t_trolleybus_r01.jpg ), 
  do n't worry , at this rate we 'll end up fighting for russia . 
  am i the only one here who was never scared and only felt sorry for m\u00f6rk\u00f6 ? 
  i feel sad and reminded of all the shit we had to endure throughout history . 
  we are still [ even more mongol ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_kurult%c3%a1j ), 
  little-known fact that waste is what gives it its colour . 
  i would n't be surprised if it was a hungarian that said this . 
  i walked through this for less than a minute and my shirt still was soaked . 
  i also saw a guy standing in the middle of the sidewalk in only his boxers . 
  yeah , i 've heard people call our language letter salad . 
  i hear it a lot in relation to uralic languages . 
  i 'm proud that my country sent volunteers to aid our cousins in need . 
  hungarian here , i feel close to you not only because of language , but also because i personally feel comfortable in finnish culture . 
  the kite works as long as its yeltsin, 
  actually , that is just distortion by the map . 
  [ hungary is still more north ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_northernmost_point ) . 
  [ here is also a reminder that not all former eastern bloc countries have shitty cycling infrastructure . 
  ] ( https://bicycledutch.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/danube_cycle_path_budapest.jpg ) [ bonus combino . gif ] ( http://i.imgur.com/znaidav.gif ), 
  hungary is north relative to romania and has related language to finnish and estonian . 
  hungary into nordic first . 
  why are we so far from the rest of our family ? 
  [ can we join ? 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/am_21_sz%c3%a1zhalombatta.jpg ), 
  [ it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlpp8ixm7ms ) [ must be ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tszu8upuxg ) [ our uralic blood ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xzrfmm7cd4 ), 
  yeah , many people in my country would object to the term `` eastern europe '' . 
  are n't we in central europe though ? 
  they still have old friend hungary , though . 
  of course they ca n't pull off an argentina . 
  they do n't have any british territories ( except maybe the base on cyprus ) to invade . 
  i actually liked the groke ... 
  i thought it was the u.k. 
  think about it * both drive on the left * both are polite * both are monarchies who once had empires * both dislike the mainland * both are known for tea drinking, 
  not until they get rid of harper . 
  i liked the weather there ( i tend to like weather which normal people consider horrible ) , the general atmosphere , and the fact that it was by the sea made it feel somewhat quaint and picturesque . 
  revise trianon, 
  it 's even stranger that our two northern cousins did not decide on the obviously superiour \u0171 . m\u0171\u00e1h\u00e1h\u00e1h\u00e1\u00e1h\u00e1h, 
  i know that we are very distantly related , but can you understand any of this ? 
  ( do n't look it up ) if you already saw it , did you understand it the first time ? 
  hungary can not into recognition, 
  this is pretty accurate portrayal of the current situation . 
  yeah , there was actually a blizzard on the first day of spring where i live ( new jersey , usa ), 
  that 's just asking for russia to invade . 
  if you do n't mind me asking , which city ? 
  you have no idea . 
  \u041f\u043e\u0448\u043b\u0430 will be sent to gulag for reeducation . 
  that did n't turn out so well , though , did it ? 
  new headline : global temperatures fall due to nuclear winter . 
  we have [ f\u00e1nk ] ( http://aprosef.hu/szalagos_fank ) , which are doughnut-like pastries . 
  a better example would be south africa with cape town , johannesburg , and pretoria . 
  i 'll add the [ national railway museum ] ( http://www.nrm.org.uk/ ) . 
  a very pleasant and interesting experience . 
  i 'd say its more second russian empire than new ussr . 
  a frightened man came to the kgb . 
  `` my talking parrot has disappeared . '', 
  `` that 's not the kind of case we handle . 
  go to the criminal police . '', 
  `` excuse me , of course i know that i must go to them . 
  i am here just to tell you officially that i disagree with the parrot . '', 
  after going to the wc , i actually burned myself on the faucets in tegel . 
  i have no idea why the water was so hot . 
  imagine having to walk 5.5 km for a roll of toilet paper . 
  york is nice too . 
  thank you , i will be looking forward to seeing it . 
  which cultures do you plan on doing ? 
  you said you are going to do eastern european - will you focus on bulgaria only , or do other countries such as hungary ? 
  thank you for taking the time to answer questions , and i hope the series goes we l. 
  do n't forget trianon revision . 
  [ they 're onto us !, 
  maybe you mean umlauts ? 
  was n't schaffhausen bombed by the americans ? 
  it 's alright , i 'm just weary from past experiences is all . 
  i understand that the baltics suffered greatly under the soviets , and that it is relatively unknown to the rest of the world , but a lot of the rhetoric surrounding this history seems like an attempt to excuse the nazis .
