  communism ? 
  today 's russia is as about as far from communism as you can get . 
  well , greece and turkey have already had clashes . 
  i 'm assuming this means romanians can now download 1 terabyte in a second . 
  basically turkish trianon . 
  [ freedom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_hungary_\\ ( 1526 % e2 % 80 % 931867 \\ ) ), 
  alright , that was a stupid thing to say . 
  i 've just very wary about these kinds of things . 
  apologies if i offended anyone . 
  since when were the nazis the ` lesser ' evil ? 
  in much of europe , this kind of crime is considered abnormal , yet in the u.s , its just another saturday . 
  it 's the version of got shown in hungary . 
  even the u.s , which has the world 's largest railway network at 224,792 km , is nearly * half * as large as its greatest extent , which was 409,177 km in 1916 . 
  land ? 
  i though we were both represented by genghis ? 
  [ we did it once , we can do it again . 
  i 'm fairly certain that 14:88 is not a valid time of day . 
  living in the northeast u.s. for a few years , there are much more passenger trains and public transport than other parts of the country , but still much less than back in europe . 
  that 's extremely wrong , i do n't know where you got that from . 
  you 're obviously describing hungarians . 
  do you need some lotion ? 
  islam itself is no more inherently bad than christianity or judaism , but i do agree that the pushing of agendas by the wahhabis and salafists have poisoned it significantly . 
  gay, 
  secret denmark, 
  we have n't gone * that * downhill . 
  needs more ouzo . 
   we should have nuked russia from this earth . 
  it 's so poor ( it 's gdp is of the order of magnitude of spains ) that we would n't even have noticed it being gone while i agree with your views on the situation , wow , what a disgusting statement . 
  if this tree survives for 500 more years , it will literally be older than some fossils . 
  just \u00d6 ? 
  amateurs . 
  \u00d6\u0150 master race all the way . 
  austro-hungarian *, 
  so you guys literally had a pm named bravery ? 
  he looks like a normal hungarian to me . 
  [ fixed . 
  m\u00f6rk\u00f6 is n't evil though . 
  she just wants friends , but nobody wants to be her friend because she 's so cold . 
  it 's sad :(, 
   asdjisjija\u00e4\u00e4 !, 
  yeah , i understand , nobody really knows who we are , except our neighbours ( and most of them hate us ) . 
  still , finland is one of my favourite countries , and i would love to have more cultural exchange with you guys , as well as estonia and the others who do n't have their own country . 
  that is what i would call perfect weather . 
  in my view , anything south of hungary is basically the sahara . 
  just remember to keep rubbing [ this ] ( http://electricitymap.tmrow.co/ ) in their face . 
  it will make their tears taste much better . 
  which is why we must keep looking for a solution . 
  not capitalism either . 
  yeah , people died , but since they were russians and everybody knows russians are subhuman , they do n't count . 
  pis is leftist in the same way that donald trump is leftist . 
  turks do n't look european ? 
  i 'd beg to differ . 
  besides , even if they did look more arabic , most people seem to forget that all people of the me are caucasian . 
  congratulations , you 've created a monster . 
  well , all islamic terrorists are right-wing by definition . 
  you mean we * enhanced * the local culture . 
  incorrect . 
  going fully automated luxury gay space communism is the way of the future . 
  can we be accepted as honourary landlocked estonians ? 
  brings back memories from dcs . 
  my feelings whenever i read a comment like this can be summed up by this brilliant statement from / u/trezbien :  i 'm not russian , and i 'm not a fan of their blinkered nationalism and even more delusional imperialism , but to state that the russians are inherently predisposed to corruption and are solely responsible for the condition they are in is fucking bordering on racial science . 
  there still seem to be a lot more swedes and dutch around on the internet in general . 
  he stresses every day about the hardships of poor oppressed russian minorities . 
  magyar g\u00e9pipari at its finest . 
   better to have it in the open and acknowledge he was a cunt and a source of national embarassment . 
  but this poster does nothing of the sort . 
  [ you do n't ? 
  ] ( https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/teamfortress/images/c/c8/pyro.png/revision/latest?cb=20150127181554 ), 
  would you be willing to take requests/commissions for certain air forces ? 
   i 'm not russian , and i 'm not a fan of their blinkered nationalism and even more delusional imperialism , but to state that the russians are inherently predisposed to corruption and are solely responsible for the condition they are in is fucking bordering on racial science . 
  thank you . 
  whenever the topic of russia is brought up in this subreddit , people almost always seem to forget this . 
  russia 's shitty government does not mean that every russian person is evil . 
  well , people call us mongols sometimes . 
  that and revise trianon . 
  what about us ? 
  get a hold of yourself hrab\u011b !, 
  this reminds me of some things i saw in hungary during the massive storm a few years ago . 
  ** c o m m u n i s m **, 
  on which planet is this ? 
  i have been in austria quite a lot recently , and i have never seen or heard of this behaviour at all . 
  na mate , we need our coastline back . 
  that 's literally the definition of `` left '' on the left-right spectrum . 
  if they do not want equality , they are * not * left wing , no matter what they may call themselves . 
  though if maastricht was flooded , maybe we 'd get [ these guys ] ( http://livaudaisnet.com/nature/fossils/muzzy/mosasaur1.jpg ) back . 
  of course it 's in comic sans . 
  the seismic weapon was specifically designed not to harm erd\u00e9ly . 
  it definitely was no worse . 
  through the nazi lines, 
  hey !, 
  why does everyone keep forgetting about us ? 
  we are even [ more mongol ] ( http://kurultaj.hu/wp-content/uploads/on.jpg ) than the finns !, 
  yes . 
  i 'm even one of the people who is supportive of refugees , but wahhabism has absolutely no excuse being allowed anywhere . 
  can you please spare some for us ? 
  i must be secretly finnish . 
  it 's 18 degrees where i am and i feel like i am about to die of a heat stroke . 
  i understand , and i think that the crimes of the soviets should be more known . 
  it 's just that sometimes , this kind of behaviour seems less about exposing the red army and more about excusing the nazis . 
  holy shit , everybody knows that the red army were war criminals by now .
