  we do n't want people who act like savage animals . 
  if it was chinese , vietnamese or austrian immigrants , no one would give a shit because they do n't have a shitty violent extremist culture , and neither do the hungarians , that 's why we find moving to western europe acceptable . 
  just look at poland for example , they took in over 1 million ukrainian refugees and they do n't seem to give a shit , while they are one of the main voices against non-european immigration into the eu . 
  ehh we do have some oligarchs who are currently anti-fidesz , the prime example is simicska lajos , who used to be the fidesz money-guy ( 11 . richest person in hungary ) and turned against them , and now he tries to salvage whatever non-governmental media we have by buying it before fidesz does , and allegedly helps out jobbik financially , them being the biggest opposition . 
  momentum also managed to make a big campaign against the olympics , allegedly from smaller individual donations and the smart usage of resources . 
  yeah me too what 's your point ? 
  east asians are basically the model immigrants . 
  africans and arabs are the rock bottom , while we are somewhere inbetween . 
   they 're all correlated with the same mysterious international organizations which is somewhat true , just because fidesz uses them as boogeymen , people like soros , sutherland etc. 
  are trying to push migration on us , the `` refugees welcome '' people are just useful idiots , and there have been leaks linking them to a lot of eu politicians , including cdu ones . 
   we should rally up behind orb\u00e1n because only he can defeat such evil . 
  it 's a cheap tactic but a seemingly effective one . 
  of course he 's fortunate in this situation given that he does n't really have any well established political opposition yet . 
  well that 's why the other parties should adapt to the situation . 
  in hungary , if you 're not totally against refugees and the current eu migration policy , you 're basically not getting into the parliament even , which is fine by me . 
  the problem is that fidesz is linking this issue to other issues , and if you are against any of them , they will assume that you are against them on migration too , and then they start berating you on their propaganda channels and they call you some kind of migrant worshipper . 
  a nice example is how jobbik was mainly against this whole ceu debacle and fidesz is trying to push a narrative that just because of this , jobbik is a leftist pro-migration party funded by soros . 
   you are left with orban 's meps or maybe jobbik 's , but siding with jobbik is prolly political suicide . 
  well that was certanily true a couple of years ago but our political climate is getting really shaken up , jobbik kinda shifted/is shifting to a center-right popular party ( basically they want to become a fidesz with more nationalism and less corruption ) , fidesz are actually calling them leftists and liberals and some of their more radical supporters are turning against them , and we also have a new player on the block ( momentum movement ) , who are a really young party mostly led by young people , students and intellectuals , but no one is completely sure about their stances , but i 'm pretty optimistic because they seemed pretty rational and centrist from what interviews i 've seen . 
   to me it seems like orban 's party is the only thing that can change anything on an eu level , for a hungarian voter . 
  well that 's usually the case for every country , hence why a lot of people say that the eu should be reformed because it just does n't work well enough and it 's too bureucratic . 
  i 'm pretty optimistic about the v4 though . 
  well there are a lot of people who support orb\u00e1n 's migration policy but otherwise hate him , myself included . 
  if they acted like immigrants from vietnam for example , no one would have any problem with immigration . 
  why do you enjoy arguing semantics ? 
  the real victims \u2122, 
  france , germany and sweden have cancer from smoking too much but they are in denial and are trying to force the v4 to smoke too because they say it 's good . 
  more like the fat bully who is only tolerated by everyone because he can fight well and will protect you if some other bully picks on you . 
  he also likes to show off his wealth to seem cool , but in reality his family can barely pay the rent . 
  sometimes he takes creepshots of naked girls in the changing room and sells them to everyone . 
   hungary , used to be nice , turned into a bully , same goes with poland . 
  well i 'll be all for leaving if the eu leaders will get even more degenerate, 
  i was being sarcastic, 
  of course , because i 've never travelled around various eu countries . 
  you do n't have enough of them to cause problems , even though you have slightly more than us . 
  yep, 
  but they are oppressed !!!!!!!!!!!!!, 
  it 's not their fault !, 
  it 's completely our fault that we are poor though , definitely not the fault of soviets and the western europeans who threw us under soviet occupation like a bone , the same tolerant saints who are shitting all over us in this thread . 
  ah , the good ol' progressive-feminist-islamist alliance . 
  so fucking european that it gives me a boner and makes me want to join the swedish greens . 
  i care for them but since i 'm not a masochistic idiot like you westerners , i do n't want to fuck up my country forever just so i can call myself `` tolerant '' , because some politician controlled by banks told me that it 's what i should do . 
  tell me a single eu country where the muslim community is not absolutely garbage . 
  you ca n't . 
  there 's no amount of money that could convince me to create a rinkeby , molenbeek or saint-denis here , we have enough problems as it is already . 
  if only you westerners had so much empathy and muh values when it comes to eastern europe than you do when it comes to refugees , a.k.a economic migrants and opportunists . 
  which was perfectly legal and not undemocratic , even though it was unethical . 
  i think freedom of expression is way more violated in western europe because of shitty pc culture and hate speech laws , the only illegal speech here is holocaust denial afaik, 
  back then no one told us that eu values means neoprogressivism and filling up your country with muslims because that 's what some bankers like soros and sutherland wants . 
  well that 's what we do n't want to do , and that 's what makes us not european . 
  catch-22 if you ask me . 
  so where did we violate any of these ? 
  idiots like verhofstadt think that european values = shitty neoprogressivism and filling your country with muslims . 
  if those are the european values then i 'd rather join fucking russia . 
  well they certainly used to be , but people who do n't support them are really biased against them imo . 
  i 'm a jobbik voter and i follow several of their leaders ' speeches , debates and discussions , i also know their programme , and on most issues i find them really good and sensible , they also agree on a lot of things with liberal/centrist parties even though none of them want to admit it . 
  they also cater a lot to young people , students and intellectuals . 
  they are certainly nationalists and right-wing , but in a more modern , common sense and anti-corruption way than fidesz for example , but their past is haunting them , and they are kind of in a crossfire right now with the left calling them nazis and fidesz supporters/more radical jobbik supporters calling them too liberal . 
  the other opposition parties are the socialists who only enjoy the support of some old people ( they and jobbik are both polling around 10 % ) , and the other small parties are polling below 5 % which is n't enough to even get into the parliament . 
  source ? 
  jobbik , and next year, 
  agreed : , 
  point . 
  no one has been elected yet , they can protest if le pen wins , but it 's dumb to do it now . 
  what are these people protesting ? 
  having an election ? 
  bunch of fucking hypocrites acting like fascists while calling mlp a fascist . 
  nato is what protects us , not eu . 
  also you just said that her being successful would be bad just because you do n't agree with her views , which is kinda dumb . 
  she would either fail and never get elected again or do well and that 's good . 
  a 2005 study by the swedish national council for crime prevention found that people of foreign background were 2.5 times more likely to be suspected of crimes than people with a swedish background , including immigrants being four times more likely to be suspected of for lethal violence and robbery , five times more likely to be investigated for sex crimes , and three times more likely to be investigated for violent assault . 
  the number of `` confirmed cases of lethal violence '' has fluctuated between 68 and 112 in the period of 2006 -- 2015 , with a decrease from 111 in 2007 to 68 in 2012 , followed by an increase to 112 in 2015 according to the 2016 scs 1.7 per cent of persons stated that they had been exposed to a sexual offence . 
  this is an increase of more than 100 per cent compared to 2012 and a 70 per cent compared to 2014 , when 1.0 per cent of persons stated exposure . 
  exposure to sexual offences is significantly more common among women than men , and most common in the 20-24 age bracket . 
  sexual offences are most common in a public place and in most cases the perpetrator is unknown to the victim source : wikipedia ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crime_in_sweden , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_and_crime#sweden ) [ sex crime rates have been growing in sweden in recent years ] ( https://www.bra.se/bra/nytt-fran-bra/arkiv/press/2016-11-03-utsatthet-for-sexualbrott-har-okat-bland-kvinnor.html ) couple this with the fact that recently [ women are less likely to report rapes ] ( http://torbjornbergman.se/?p=1264 ) [ 80 % of sex attacks in bathhouses were committed by migrants ] ( https://polisen.se/global/www%20och%20intrapolis/%c3%96vriga%20rapporter/lagesbild%20over%20sexuella%20ofredanden.pdf )  also , from a study conducted in 2010 , swedish media seems to be a right-wing bias ( even though it had been accused of having a left-wing bias before that ) http://www.dn.se/debatt/starkt-negativ-rapportering-om-mona-sahlin-i-expressen/ well ...

  she wrote that it was something that she started doing around 2002 , when language tests were being debated and the sweden democrats started to become more influential . 
  she was also afraid that sweden 's political climate would become more similar to that of denmark . 
  sweden did n't become like denmark , thank goodness . 
  maybe the opinion corridor helped . 
  but the price was high : widespread self-censorship , a fear to examine reality objectively , a diminished belief in the power of arguments . 
  and as a result a dumbed-down public , moral-panicked politicians and social problems that should have gotten attention and been dealt with a long time ago . 
  it proved to be an expensive corridor .

  none of the political beliefs you seem to have are anywhere near that . 
  because i 'm a classical liberal , which means a live and let live attitude , and letting people do whatever they want to as long as it does n't hurt anyone , like gay marriage , abortion rights or marijuana legalisation . 
  the term `` liberal '' has been hijacked by progressives , who are ** not ** liberals , since one of the main pillars of liberalism should be the protection of free speech , and the progressives push for hate speech laws , thought policing and political correctness .
