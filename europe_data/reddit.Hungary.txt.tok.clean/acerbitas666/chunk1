medieval times were better , but everything is better than what we have today . 
   will alienate at least half of its own following lol not even close . 
  after the first 4 years people ( and i 'm talking about ' 98 - ' 02 ) should have never elected them again . 
  but they did . 
  and the sad thing is that there is no alternative . 
  people wo n't vote for the left because it 's in scrambles and it 's just like orban 's . 
  jobbik is full of stupid people . 
  aaand that 's it . 
  there 's no one else to vote for who would have remotely any chance against the strong and powerful orban who in these 5 years made himself basically immovable . 
  we would be better off if we joined austria again . 
  they could surely govern this awful country better than our current representatives . 
  aye , independence for scotland !, 
  im in class and i had to hold back the laugh . 
  thanks . 
  they live among you my friend . 
  do n't switch it up !, 
  it must feel bad . 
  thank god we hungarians do n't have a car manufacturing company !, 
  ^ ( cries ^ inside ), 
   thinking we were local hungarians are there that many hungarians there ? 
  well if you only hit `` space '' then it wo n't work right ? 
  because it needs actual characters in order for you to submit . 
  so i used ^ becuase it 's an actual character but you can increase ^ the ^ height ^ ^ of ^ ^ text ^ ^ with ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ all ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ disappears, 
  yeah you are not upset at all . 
  look if you are on the level of a 14 year old it 's simply better not to comment anymore . 
  i have told you that you are wrong with sound arguments . 
  i do n't understand why you have to be so dogmatic . 
  i have had sound arguments . 
  i have written down the reasoning . 
  this is in the post as well . 
  if you bothered to read it then maybe you would n't be so upset, 
  firstly i calculated all the hungarians by the hungarian census in which 14.7 percent did n't declare their ethnicity . 
  that lives us at 8 mill . 
  hungarians . 
  then in slovakia there 's 500k in romania 1200k and in serbia 125k in zakkarpatia 150k that leaves us at 10mil . 
  the hungarian is the biggest ethnic group even still , so i do n't know what you are crying about . 
  the austrians ( who all have been deported after ww2 ) could tell a different story . 
  they had more people in the region than hungarians and now they do n't . 
  the czechs have a much higher number as well , but like 26 percent did n't declare their ethnicity and while i could write them off as czechs since they probably are it would be a bit unfair . 
  do n't ever turn on a television . 
  please . 
  for your own safety . 
  this is just romanian propaganda these problems did n't exist until the 17th century . 
  the peasant was a peasant while the noble was noble . 
  the nationality did n't matter it was the king you served that mattered . 
  a romanian , slovak , serbian , croat peasant had the same rights as a hungarian peasant . 
  they were peasants no one cared about them . 
  they could worship their god , speak the way they liked etc. 
  what you are talking about only appears after the 17th century . 
  when for example romanians try to create their own country . 
  which is a threat to hungary . 
  so the hungarians repress this by laws that are aimed against minorities . 
  exactly . 
  you would want it back , right ? 
  that was the point . 
  also , i did n't say i agree with orb\u00e1n . 
  i hate his guts . 
  he 's a phony giving citizenship was mostly so he could stay in power ( they granted 700 000 citizenship ) . 
  the people who went to vote voted for him because of this . 
  personally here 's my reasoning ( this greatly differs from most of the hungarians ) : central-europe is greatly divided even though we have the same goals we are trampling on each other . 
  we are waiting for every opportunity to back stab the other . 
  i am hungarian but i would be glad if the whole of central-europe would be romanian , or slovak or whatever . 
  i would gladly learn slovak or romanian . 
  it 's not about someone being slovak , romanian , serb , croat , ukrainian , polish , austrian , slovene . 
  it 's about having a strong region . 
  i want to live in an economically stable and rich central-europe not this backwards back stabbing one . 
  that 's one of the many reasons i created / r/austriahungary  then what 's the problem ? 
  there 's the eu !, 
  the eu is a fucking joke . 
  if at least we would be on the same level of integration as the usa but we are n't . 
  the eu is more like an economical fund . 
  helping countries east of germany not to collapse . 
  i would rather live in a country in prosperity where i 'm an ethnic minority than what we have in the current form . 
   then why wo n't you leave for a rich country ? 
  i 'm definitely planning on going abroad for a few years as a life experience . 
  but this is my homeland . 
  this is where i was born and i wo n't give it up for a place that i could n't call my home . 
  thanks for x-posting and giving credits !, 
  if you guys liked this make sure to check out / r/austriahungary we are an open community for all kinds of discussion regarding the empire and the today 's countries . 
  this part of europe is so divided nowadays i would like to see more unity and that 's the reason why the subreddit was created . 
  we have weekly discussion threads on wednesdays ( this week we were talking about slovakia ) . 
  i wonder how would the romanians feel if they one day wake up without transylvania . 
  or the slovaks if their country disappeared . 
  obviously it 's not nice to post these things for a pm . 
  but i feel like it 's so meaningless . 
  i mean this does n't mean that hungary wants to cut all ties with the surrounding countries or wants to annex them . 
  it 's just ... you know ... history . 
  i always get a bit upset when romanians or slovaks get so aggressive when someone is posting things like this . 
  it 's such an irrational fear . 
  even if hungary wanted to , it simply ca n't reverse trianon . 
  sure . 
  this is not a right wing movement or anything like that . 
  we like everyone , 
  i do n't mean it in political context but rather in an everyday one . 
  ^ ^ or ^ ^ i ^ ^ just ^ ^ want ^ ^ the ^ ^ austrian ^ ^ overlords ^ ^ to ^ ^ rule ^ ^ over ^ ^ this ^ ^ wretched ^ ^ nation . 
  ^ ^ so ^ ^ we ^ ^ get ^ ^ moar ^ ^ euro ^ ^ monies . 
  no worries , trolls and the worst of the right ( bashing on cultures , ethnicities etc ) will be banned . 
  there wo n't be any `` annex transylvania lol xdxd '' or `` cleanase transylvania ! '', 
  posts . 
  i will make sure .
