  this is just for fun . 
  my favourite part of hungarian history is the a-h times so i wanted to have a place for it since it does n't have a dedicated place on reddit . 
  it 's on the users which direction the subreddit will head towards but i would be most happy if it becomes a place for exchanging culture , language and having toughtful discussions . 
  the reunion ? 
  no , not at all . 
  not in austria , nor in hungary . 
  but i want to make it common . 
  because i feel like we central europeans ( austrians , czechs , slovaks , poles , hungarians , slovenes , croats , romanians ) have a common root , a common culture a common mindset . 
  but we are all each others enemy sadly and thus our own . 
  instead of advancing , growing together we are trampling on each other for no reason . 
  the old a-h empire obviously will never reunite . 
  there will always be too much opposition in our neighbor countries . 
  but austria 's and hungary 's relations are not that bad . 
  i would say from the neighbors hungary has the best relations with austria ( or croatia ) . 
  so maybe with the current borders a new a-h could be made . 
  and it 's generally easier to maintain order and happiness in a country where there are only 2 big ethnic groups . 
  you have to reverse it !, 
  hungarian , it 's pretty much like the finnish in a sense that it does n't make any sense but the word is gramatically correct but would never be used in anything except in competitions . 
  ** elt\u00f6redezetts\u00e9gmentes\u00edt\u0151tlen\u00edttethetetlens\u00e9gtelen\u00edt\u0151tlenkedhetn\u00e9tek ** here 's something that actually makes sense , kinda . . altough it still would n't be used unless you are insane ** legeslegmegk\u00e9rd\u0151jelezhetetlenebbjeitek\u00e9ib\u0151l ** - i could translate it to something like this : from the most unquestionable of thee . 
  ( it 's fucked up i know ) . 
  and here 's a bonus just because i love you guys : ** \u00e1rv\u00edzt\u0171r\u0151 t\u00fck\u00f6rf\u00far\u00f3g\u00e9p ** in these two words every hungarian accented letter is represented . 
  the shortest would be something like - a - or - 's - 's being the shortened form of - \u00e9s - which is the hungarian word for ` and ' but it 's not really used today because \u00e9s is short as fuck already :d, 
  i think it was a joke . 
   then everyone called me czech . 
  and you are actually hungarian ... dundundun, 
  wait ... and how does it really belong to you ? 
  yes it has peacefully given over its territory by no outside force . 
  i will be your friend , 
  pun explained : ` ugrik ' means ` jumps ' in hungary, 
  what 's the matter with my name ? 
  i think what you suggested is absurd , so it made me blow air out of my nose just a tiny bit harder . 
  so i upvoted you . 
  so i guess you have at least that going for you ... 
  ** k\u00f6sz\u00f6n\u00f6m ** - thank you in hungarian ** mi ? 
  ** - what ? 
  in hungarian we are clearly related brothers !, 
  even our simplest words sound the same !, 
  probably dicks ... and a lot of them . 
  hrvatska this is called democracy, 
  no we do n't have relations with those countries . 
  slovenia , romania , croatia are all better choices than those two . 
  lol . 
  v4 has no relations with those countries whatsoever . 
  yeah , no !, 
  i had not had sex for 19 years . 
  i probably should go out now and rape everyone . 
  i do n't believe you and i did n't find anything on google . 
  i actually would n't mind that . 
  i want a unified strong europe . 
  it does n't matter for me that who controls it . 
  well x percent of hungarians wants to unite with szeklerland and y percent wants the same . 
  you get where i 'm going with this ? 
  well , it always gets out of control with a few retarded comments . 
  i 'm sure that there would n't be any trouble if the comments are n't like ` haha retarded gypsy romanian shit thinks that they control transylvania ' or ` huehue hungary go back to mongolia where you belong ', 
  who said that there will be hungarians in romania when moldavia joins romania ? 
  wow i 'm surprised that not a single hungarian has commented on this . 
  well then ... good luck pals  i 'm sure it will happen one day . 
  i pitch in \u00ed\u00e9\u00e1\u0151\u00fa\u0171\u00f6\u00fc\u00f3, 
  so we got transylvania back in the second joke ? 
  it 's not like they can do anything . 
  the eu would stop them . 
  nothing 's gon na change if they get elected . 
  maybe everything will be written in the [ old hungarian alphabet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_hungarian_alphabet ) but that 's about it . 
  sir you are mistaken . 
  i 'm a homosexual gypsy and i 'm voting for jobbik . 
  saying something like :  `` hardcore jobbik '' guys , who always wear all black with a turul or/and pre-trianon maps . 
  those are the core voters of jobbik , this is simply just not true . 
  they are n't the core , they were the initial jobbik base yes . 
  but this has changed greatly by now . 
  jobbik is not a radical party anymore it 's not more on the nationalistic spectrum than fidesz . 
  so spewing this nonsense is really just showing how leftists like you are trying to bend the opinion of the international public . 
  and before people start downvoting me . 
  yes jobbik was a radical rightist party but they are not the same as they were like 10 years ago . 
  today jobbik is anything but radical . 
  yes that 's true but i did n't want to confuse anyone since it seems everyone is ignorant of the history of this region . 
  still my point stands . 
  there 's no such thing as romania or yugoslavia yet . 
   controlling the entire hungarian plain and large sections of romania and yugoslavia , what is n't the game set in medieval times ? 
  then hungary is controlling hungarian territory and a bit of serbia . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  there are 92 votes on you . 
  see : hungary - 92, 
  please ... you have no idea what you are talking about . 
  hungary did n't just slip through ... and yes austria is good they won almost all of their games in the group stages . 
  and for taking in the refrigerators, 
  for killin ' all them juice ? 
  i think if there 's someone who thinks that hungarians were first in transylvania then that person is really stupid . 
  there !, 
  on position 30, 
  it was a joke post . 
  you fucking retard . 
  also i was not actually born in 1999 , i was born in 1997 i just wanted to help you guide you to the fact that it was an ironical post . 
  it 's so crazy to think about the fact that there are people who were born after the 2000s . 
  i mean ... wow ... 
  i was born in 1999 and ca n't believe there are now people walking on earth who were only 1 year old when 911 happened . 
  i for one still remember it fondly . 
  you only created this thread to hide a penis by the means of the great lakes did n't you ? 
  europe is the center of the universe . 
  i do n't understand why we should care whether we can draw them or not . 
  on behalf of all hungarians ( if this was indeed plastered by a hungarian ) , i apologize .
