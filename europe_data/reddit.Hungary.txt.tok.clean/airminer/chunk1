it 's ok , we have china . 
  because this cap was only introduced because of the protests . 
  if the protests stop , they will quietly raise the cap as much as they like . 
  to finnish and estonian . 
  they did n't care ? 
  the reason that rule is there , because every time a pb cartoon reaches the / r/all frontpage , they have to deal with a hurricane of subpar submissions / people not respecting the rules , and general butthurt in the comment sections . 
  they want the sub to grow organically - which it does - , not through rapid surges of popularity . 
  or the people 's front of judea / judean people 's front, 
  yes , but that cap only applies to phone calls . 
  this tax is mentioned in a different paragraph entirely . 
  all mainstream left wing parties currently have more supporters ( or at least voters ) than the lmp . 
  belarus was buying up banned polish apples , and reselling them to russia . 
  belarus was buying up banned polish apples , and reselling them to russia . 
  well , they do n't really fit anywhere , partly because in hungary every party , when governing used right-leaning economic policies , and when in opposition , everyone supported left-leaning policies . 
  the right/left divide is mainly ideological . 
  even within this system , fidesz was the only party to change it 's alignment to it 's polar opposite : in the 1990 elections , they were a liberal party , and switched over to conservative , when they did n't get enough votes . 
  the one thing that matters , is what people would vote for . 
  yep , that seems to be it . 
  the main thing working against opposition media ( apart from their lack of popularity ) is that the biggest advertising companies are `` state-friendly '' , so opposition media do n't get any ads to sell from them , ergo they have their main source of income heavily undermined . 
  going back to rtl klub : they are the biggest , and were the most profitable commercial channel , while they were trying to be neutral , to stay on the good side of the government . 
  then the government introduced a new tax , which while did n't specify rtl klub by name , was based upon income `` levels '' , and the only companies that needed to pay the highest category tax were the two biggest channels : rtl klub and tv2 , but as tv2s owner is a friend of the government , the law was revised , and now only rtl klub is paying the highest amount of tax possible . 
  this plan has pretty much completely backfired on them though , as now the biggest commercial channel is heavily anti-government , and did n't leave the country / get sold to government sympathisers , as the presumably planned them to . 
  when i went to slovakia two years ago for a robotics competition everyone was really nice . 
  really , we do n't hear too much about slovakia here in hungary : i did n't even know about those anti-hungarian election posters until ~ two weeks ago , and i learned that only from browsing wikipedia as well . 
  i think the last time slovakia was on the news when that girl was beaten up for talking in hungarian on the phone in public , but that was a couple of years ago . 
  on a related note my cousin is from pilisszentkereszt ( mlynky ) , and there they learned slovakian in the kindergarten , 
  just to add to this topic : there have been several reports about principals who reach the end of their term , and apply for re-employment : several of them had 100 % support from the teachers , parents , and sometimes even the state-run supervision agency , have been sidelined in favour of `` government-friendly '' applicants , who have been said to be incompetent by all parties in some cases / did n't have the necessary qualifications . 
  in both of these cases the vote declaring the original principal the winner has been declared illegitimate , only to have their opponents declared winners , by a governmental decree . 
  ( principals are employed by the government , and as such they have the final say , but it is quite striking , when even the government run agency says the applicant is an idiot ), 
  just fyi : a lower erd\u0151s number is cooler , 
  windows xp is definately still used by most institutions , but i think they have upgraded to ie8, 
  what i mean is that a big corporation could push the prices really low so as to kill competition and eat the losses , if that would guarantee no competition for a couple of years . 
  if the entry price is sufficently high in the industry they can keep repeating this every couple of years and keep their monopoly relatively undisturbed . 
  while i think capitalism is the the only working system we currently have i do n't think a free market would survive the abolishment of all regulations - as soon as a corporation managed to create a monopoly / oligopoly / trust they could exploit the market to kill any potential competition and then do as they please . 
  well , the croatian-hungarian border may close soon , and the austrians also strengthened border controls on their slovenian border . 
  it may be nothing , but you never know . 
   ** we laid a bit of razor wire on the slovenian-hungarian border , then quickly removed it **  on 2015 . 
  september 25th in the morning the hungarian army had - on a experimental basis - laid some razor wire on the hungarian-slovenian border , which was removed in the afternoon - said the friday night announcement of the interior ministry . 
   as to what was the point of trying the razor wire out , which was already laid on the 175 km long serbian border was , we can only guess . 
  are they working with a new supplier ? 
  is this how they send a message to slovenia ? 
  to the migrants ? 
  we brought razor wire and did n't ? 
   the announcement stressed : the deployment of the razor wire happened because of the building of the border fence on the southern border , as a purely experimental task . 
   to prevent misunderstandings , interior minister s\u00e1ndor pint\u00e9r will attend a meeting tomorrow morning with slovenian interior minister vesna gy\u00f6rk\u00f6s znidar to discuss the `` system of border control and patrols '' . 
  also , the visegr\u00e1d 3 ( originally hungary , poland and chechoslovakia ) set the location there because of a historic meeting of the hungarian , polish and bohemian kings , to establish a trading route which goes around vienna . 
  iirc ireland had the 3rd opt out . 
  well , the good news is , that the `` nuclear option '' can only be used if voted for unanimously ( except for the state sanctioned ) , so if we can find one member state who supports us ( hint : v4 ) , they ca n't suspend our voting rights . 
  it was a peacekeeping mission in kosovo iirc . 
  the `` nuclear option '' referred to in this article is not hungary using it 's troops , it is the suggested punishment , suspending hungary 's voting rights . 
  also : the army * is * trained in riot control and peacekeeping , as that was their mission in kosovo . 
  the army only got the same rights that the police already had , if they are helping police . 
  it changes basically nothing , and is certainly not something that harms human rights or dignity any more than the status quo did . 
  [ golden rice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vitamin_a_deficiency ) , what you are referring to does n't want to combat general malnutrition . 
  it wants to combat the fact that in south-east asia , where the main component of the meals is rice , a lot of children suffer from [ vitamin a deficiency ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vitamin_a_deficiency ) , which is a leading and preventable cause of childhood blindness . 
  if protecting thousands of children 's eyesight is not a `` sensible use '' , i do n't know what could be . 
  swedes ? 
  refugees do n't need to renew their residence permit , since they can apply for citizenship before their runs out . 
  iirc they get it for at least 5 years just for being refugees . 
  other immigrants on the other hand have to renew their residence permit after iirc 3 years . 
  uber likes to suppress fares while it drives out competition , then ratchet it up when they are a monopoly . 
  they 'll do the same if they manage to drive out the taxies . 
  sorry , i meant to say it would push oil prices down would n't it ? 
  or am i grossly misinformed ? 
  the fed plans to raise the interest rates , does n't it ? 
  iirc that would push oil prices . 
  i think so . 
  however our parliament was designed to be larger than the british parliament in all 3 dimensions by at least 1 meter . 
  back then budapest was the co-capital of a great power , so it seemed appropriate . 
  well , french and german polititlcians said that they were hopeful on ending thesanctioning of russia . 
  the european sanctions are what really affect russia , and the russian sanctions mostly affect europe . 
  if they have the guts to go against the usa on this issue , they could end theor sanctions in return for donbass . 
  our police usually have their faces edited out from most footage . 
  i guess you could argue they could n't have forced ap to edit out their faces once they were beyond our borders , so they decided to use the less considerate method they could achieve in situ . 
  in hungary you are technically not allowed to film / photograph anything without everyone 's consent who is depicted on it . 
  the policewoman probably did n't want to consent to ap distributing a film of an accident which would have shown them in a negative light . 
  what i imagine happened was that the muzzled police dog started at a refugee , and the policewoman failed to restrain it soon enough . 
  this is probably not the kind of law you would be comfortable with in america , but this is the law here . 
  we may oppose the quotas , but we already registered more refugees than what 's asked for in the quotas . 
  some english spellcheckers really hate ha ** p ** sburg for some reason . 
  ( ha ** b ** sburg is an old english misspelling based on the pronunciation ), 
  yep , rejected applications also ban the claimant from the schengen zone for 1 year . 
  hungary currently considers serbia safe . 
  we also recognise kosovo , so the situation there does n't affect our position on serbia . 
  the official position is that we 'll accept those that have applied for asylum in serbia , and were rejected . 
  we 'll also accept any child travelling without their parents . 
  however as 99 % of them have not applied for asylum in serbia most of them have been rejected so far . 
  [ well , a couple hundred refugees crossed into scandinavia thorough the russian-norwegian border . 
  ] ( http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/wo-ax737a_arcti_16u_20150902174822.jpg ) it is faster than going through the balkans and may not be that much more expensive . 
  the train tracks were the one hole left on the border fence - [ this is used to plug that hole ] ( http://kep.index.hu/1/0/989/9891/98919/9891971_8772eeb9fd35f4d1409998257379ae55_x.jpg ) . 
  some news portals are speculating that there would have been a sliding door , but that was n't finished in time , so we 'll use a wagon . 
  i had run into the same problem yesterday , and [ the mods said that they 'd allow it in comments , but not submissions ] ( http://i.imgur.com/o12qnwa.png ) . 
  it 's probably because of rule 2.4 of the [ community rules and guidelines ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules )  2.4 unreliable domains including but not limited to , blogspot , tumblr , facebook and wordpress will be removed . 
  yes , the [ transportation minister ] ( http://www.thelocal.de/20150913/berlin-hits-out-at-eus-complete-failure-to-protect-its-borders ) . 
  well , if the moldovans wanted an authoritarian regime they could always ask transnistria to take over the whole country . 
  well , from what i understand it is the pro-eu parties that are being discredited / protested against right now, 
  i 've heard journalism courses advertise themselves with things like `` be the change '' . 
  i think they attract people who want to change the world and rid it of all `` injustice '' . 
  and so i guess they decided that it 's better to lie to the masses than strengthen their perceived islamophobia . 
  what they do n't understand is how hard this could backfire and breed more hostility .
