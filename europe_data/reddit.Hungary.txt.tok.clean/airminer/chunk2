  it 's in hungary . 
  you can see the budapest metro sign . 
  that man is most definitely not german . 
  [ here is the original video ] ( http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=c4c_1441294833 ) compare the [ budapest public transport logos ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0qrd7up.png ) to [ the one in the video ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rvxxgml.png ), 
  yeah . 
  [ the arabs are semitic people as well ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semitic_people ) , so we could just call it antisemitism . 
  the usa rents gunatanamo bay . 
  they have a contract from before the cuban revolution . 
  the castro government does n't recognise this , so the us transfers their rent to a bank account , which the cuban government refuses to access . 
  yes . 
  however these people do n't apply for refugee status in hungary , and as such are probably not legally considered refugees . 
  the hungarian translation of `` felony '' is the same word as the translation of `` crime '' . 
  officially there are two types of `` actions against the law '' : * `` rule breaking '' ( roughly equals misdemeanor ) * `` crime '' ( roughly equals felony ) i probably should have used `` felony '' there . 
  until sept 15th crossing the border illegally is a misdemeanor . 
  after that it 'll become a ~ ~ crime ~ ~ felony . 
  well , considering that a couple hundred african / middle eastern refugees entered scandinavia through the ** russian-norwegian border ** , because it was * cheaper than going through the balkans * , i 'd say it 's not a problem . 
  i 'm on my way !, 
  let 's hope the uk does n't exit the eu by the end of september !, 
   i mean , if a building makes it to 235 years old , is it just a `` ca n't get rid of it '' from then on ? 
  i think i speak for many europeans when i say that yes , there are buildings so old that you ca n't get rid of them . 
  and it 's fine . 
  [ our capital has entire avenues , squares and districts that have been declared world heritage sites ] ( http://www.budapest.com/city_guide/attractions/world_heritage_sites.en.html ) , and there are [ 2543 protected sites in the city , and 33918 protected sites in the whole country ] ( http://www.muemlekem.hu/muemlek ) . 
  we view them as our heritage , and try to protect them , or restore them if possible . 
  also , as our country is mostly farmland , there is no shortage of space , and as there are strict building height limits , the city grows outwards , not upwards . 
  one of the recent popes has declared himself to be capable of being wrong . 
  this makes a great exercise in formal logic as well : * if the pope is wrong about being able to be wrong , he must be right , which is a contradiction . 
  * if the pope is right about being able to be wrong , there is no contradiction therefore the pope is right . 
  hungary : kett\u0151 / k\u00e9t at least we kept the k  [ other finno-ugric languages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finno-ugric_languages#numbers ), 
  they have closed it once before , then opened it , then now they close it again . 
  it means border controls , traffic jams on the border , and refusing access to refugees . 
  it is useful against bites - particularly wolf bites . 
  they , and their bigger cousins , the [ komondors ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/komondor ) drove all the wolves out of present day hungary . 
  traditionally the puli herded ( sheep or cattle ) and looked out for wolves and the komondors slept through the day , patrolled at night and fought the wolves . 
  their fur is waterproof , so i guess dump them in some water  would have to ask someone who 's had one of them , they are quite popular here . 
  yep , the quran even mentions judaism and christianity as having the most accurate versions of god 's message , after islam . 
  ( the basic idea is that god sent messengers to all peoples , however most of them misinterpreted the message - the complete truth only known by the followers of muhammad - the final messenger ), 
  we were registering them this whole time . 
  * that 's why that fucking fence was built . 
  * we ca n't register them if we do n't catch them entering the country . 
  also : the german and french pms threatened that if hungary and other central / eastern european members ( czech republic , slovakia , etc. ), 
  did n't cooperate with their migrant related plans we would be thrown out of the schengen area / it would be abolished entirely . 
  i think this is a response to those statements . 
  no , no . 
  it 's different !, 
  these people want to get on the trains , you see . 
  hungarian top words : hungary-romania border : million guy , different immigrants . 
  asylum / austria train . 
  budapest : language , culture . 
  migrant bad . 
  camp . 
  pretty far , actually . 
  there were even jewish honorary aryans , mainly those who greatly helped the wwi war effort and some nazi party members who later learned of their heritage . 
  ok , so how about we compare them to deer ? 
  and i think it 's still probably the most humane way they could kill these whales . 
  if he had n't resigned he would have been surely removed in the current government reshuffle , or even sooner . 
  well , if it draws your attention , then it has served it 's purpose . 
  i think `` might be incorrect '' should not be called `` controversial '' . 
  the controversial tag should be used for controversial subjects , as the name suggests . 
  `` might be incorrect '' should be tagged as `` might be incorrect '' . 
  otherwise it will just lead to more confusion . 
  they eat them . 
  the whales are not endangered and the faroese kill them quickly . 
  it 's just that the sea turns red from the blood , so peta and other similar organizations like to cry over it every year . 
  iirc they hold this whale slaughter on one day each year . 
  really not different from slaughtering the pigs/cows we eat . 
  would you have liked single transferable vote better ? 
  ( [ great video explanation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8xozjkozfi ) ) ( [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/single_transferable_vote ) ) as i understand it , it is basically alternative vote with multiple winners and bigger constituencies , so it results in more-or-less proportional representation . 
  well , it * was * more artillery than bombing . 
  btw iirc the [ siege of budapest ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_budapest ) was the longest successful siege in wwii, 
  realism . 
  all hungarian statesmen , who died before they could change the country for the better , did so during a hunt . 
  we sometimes joke about `` boars '' being hungary 's biggest enemy . 
  think of the chaos if we accidentally won !, 
  nothing an amendment ca n't fix , 
  i think most people would be fine with the a-h type of deal , and remember , there were a few joined ministries , for example we had joint defence and central bank . 
  remember , we still had a complete nobility , with two houses just 70 years ago . 
  it 's trivial to trace a few generations back to prove your grandfather was born a noble . 
  aside from that , a king can always make some new ones . 
  well , [ the youngest of otto 's sons ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/georg_von_habsburg ) lives in hungary , and was the head of the hungarian red cross . 
  however , as we are talking about legitimists , it would be [ his brother ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karl_von_habsburg ) , who would get the throne . 
  btw [ the current second-in-line for throne ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferdinand_zvonimir_von_habsburg ) is competing in [ formula renault 2.0 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/formula_renault ) :d getting back to the legitimists , they would imagine a constitutional monarchy , with a 2 house parliament . 
  they would also want the king to have basically the same powers our current head-of-state does , but they want them to use it actively , to moderate all the bullshit hungarian politics usually devolves into . 
  hell , we even have a ( * really small * ) legitimist-monarchist movement , who want a habsburg restoration !, 
  they refuse to form a party , because they see all parties - as a concept - leftist . 
  so there 's a majority supporting mutual defence only in the us , and canada . 
  there 's an unnecessary 0 at the end of your link . 
  [ fixed ] ( http://cdn.trend.az/pictures/2009/09/02/hungarians_in_slovakia.jpg ), 
  i do n't mean to start a fight over this , but i would like to ask you about your definition of `` almost a minority '' . 
  * if you mean less than 50 % of the population , than the map you provided already makes hungarians ( 48.1 % ) a minority . 
  * on the other hand , if you mean `` not the most common ethnicity in the country '' , then hungarians are far ahead of the second most common ethnicity , romanians ( 14.1 % ) . 
  i think you are misunderstanding me . 
  ex-pm ferenc gyurcs\u00e1ny made that speech . 
  he would like the speech to be interpreted as a whole , as it reflects his desire to reform his ( ex - ) party . 
  current pm viktor orb\u00e1n 's party ( fidesz ) was the one which first recorded it secretly , then published excerpts from it , which reflected badly on the socialists . 
  now , the whole fidesz-recording was never published . 
  instead ex-pm gyurcs\u00e1ny published what can be reasonably believed to be the speech that was recorded . 
  ** however : ** since some voters consider gyurcs\u00e1ny a liar and cheat - not the least * because of the excerpts * - they may believe that he recorded * another * speech after the fact , which is what he published . 
  i 'm not at all familiar enough with british politics to make that judgement , however some - admittedly left leaning - news papers seemed to have that opinion . 
  from what i can see that speech on wikipedia came from the pm 's personal blog , and i guess people do n't believe him enough to think it 's the real speech . 
  the `` real '' speech , the original recording is in the current government 's hands , but does n't want to publish it .
