  i know there was some shit being cooked about this speech just last year , 8 years ( !!! ), 
  after it was made . 
  minor correction : the famous recording of the pm about robbing and lying was not a phone call . 
  it was said on a party conference , where he made a speech about how he wanted to reform the party and stopping this robbing and lying . 
  unfortunately , this party conference was recorded by the opposition party , and a single minute of the speech was enough to crush the mszp 's and the pm 's reputation maybe forever . 
  the whole speech has never been publicised btw , only that single sentence . 
  i 'm not saying they were n't corrupt as hell , but i do n't think they should have lost so much just because a reformist party leader admitted their wrongdoings , and tried to change that . 
  well , the gist of it is that the hungarian left committed seppuku , the entire hungarian right happens to be east oriented , and the major voting blocks do n't find `` pro-russianness '' as important as other aspects of the parties . 
  this is n't unique to hungary either , france 's front national , britain 's ukip and greece 's syrzia are somewhat east-oriented as well . 
  yeah , also the bosnian units were the most decorated ones of austria-hungary during wwi . 
  one of his sons was the head of the hungarian red cross , and lives in hungary . 
  the oldest lives in austria iirc . 
  [ there are no static target experiments using the lhc , but there are some using the super proton synchrotron ( sps ) ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/3dwnzk0 ), 
  also , it 's not like mszp was the only successor party . 
  we still have the labour party for orthodox communists ( two of them in fact ) , and while they never got into the parliament , they split off because the mszp was not communist enough . 
  yeah , that 's what i figured . 
  the thing i 'm not sure about is whether it applies to calling ** to ** abroad , or only calling ** from ** abroad . 
  i 'd guess it 's the latter , and you would only get local call prices when calling hungarian phone numbers , and would have to pay foreign prices when calling eg . 
  belgian phones ( this does n't apply however if all of you get hungarian sim cards  ) that said , their base prices for european calls are 160 huf ( 0.54 eur ) per minute , and for 2000 huf ( 6.73 eur ) per month you can reduce that amount to its half ( so 6.73 eur per month and 0.27 eur per minute ) . 
  i 'm not familiar with belgian prices , but if that , plus the base package price is still worth it for you ( the aforementioned 10k huf ) , i think there 's nothing stopping you from getting it - or only using it when abroad and having a belgian sim card for local calls . 
  data roaming fees seems to have been abolished in this package as well btw . 
  at least he could complete his phd . 
  / r/hungary is bilingual , but irrelevant :(, 
  where would you put this oppression period ? 
  just asking because historically relations were pretty good , we eventually had our own compromise as well , and it 's not something we talk much about here in hungary . 
  basically , here we are taught that he wanted to make croatia an equal of hungary inside the habsburg empire , but the austrians double-crossed him , and the resulting situation was worse for both hungary and croatia, 
  while he did have victories over us , here he is mostly remembered for [ losing the battle of p\u00e1kozd ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_p%c3%a1kozd ) against an inferior hungarian army and losing 100-200 men while we lost only 7 . 
  if i 'm reading [ the ( very brief ) source they cite ] ( http://zik.ua/en/news/2015/02/27/94000_zakarpatya_residents_get_hungarian_citizenship_568273 ) right , the statistic seems to be the total number or citizenships issued in zakarpattia under the simplified application process in effect since 2011 , and so most of them are from before last years events . 
  the rules have n't changed since it 's introduction in 2011 . 
  well , i can see the austrians point . 
  they have just been through the 1848-49 revolution , which they only managed to suppress with russian help . 
  after this , they clamped down * heavily * and centralised across the empire . 
  so after this agreeing to give the hungarians autonomy - who they just defeated , and whose generals they executed - when the whole 1848-49 war broke out because franz joseph revoked autonomies granted by his predecessor in 1948 , would not have been the most sane decision . 
  whatever the case , in the end the austrians still had to basically divide their hre and non-hre lands between two governments in austria-hungary , with a couple of exceptions ( galicia , lodomeria and dalmatia was governed as part of cisleithania ) . 
  nah , austria still wanted to be part of the gro\u00dfdeutsches reich - in fact , they wanted to rule it . 
  however , they lost the battle for primacy with the prussians . 
  they did n't want to be ruled by the prussians however , so they made up with the hungarians to compensate for their loss of influence in germany . 
  the idea that `` europe '' or `` the west '' values democracy and freedom above all else is quite a recent idea , and if you think about since when it has * actually been true * , it is even more recent . 
  even if we just look at the cold war - and i know that america is not geographically european , but the european nato members did n't seem to object to this much - the usa and overthrew democratically elected socialist governments and sponsored juntas , dictators and religious extremists wherever it could , to counter soviet influence , in operations such as operation condor . 
  europe on the other hand was also not as `` democratic '' as you suggest , with spain and greece being military dictatorships until '75 and '74 respectively , and half of europe being in the eastern block - all of which i would still count as culturally european . 
  russians value a strong leader more than democracy , and they are not alone with this , as turkey shows . 
  their oligarchy is not unique either , with ukraine mimicking that model perfectly , and with the hungarian government building their budding oligarchy they have followers in the eu as well . 
  corruption is also endemic in many eu states . 
  the difference between us and the russians is not as big as you think . 
  they share our culture 's base in religion , our history and philosophy . 
  the desire for `` freedom '' is not shared by every european - exemplified by the resurgence of radical right parties - and * especially * not shared by all nato members , exemplified by turkey . 
  on the subject of turkey , in terms of democracy or personal freedoms , they are equivalent to russia . 
  who you align with does n't make a country `` better '' or `` more european '' . 
  the nato alliance with turkey has always been purely strategic in nature , and has never been about turkey ideologically supporting freedom . 
  just to get back to the topic on hand , i do n't think europe and european culture is or should be defined based on its desire for democracy or freedom , as that is a relatively new interest of the continent , but by the shared cultural history , folklore and cultural works of the continent for defining the culture , and by the solely the geography for defining the continent . 
  just to answer your question , yes , i would consider americans to be `` culturally european '' , just like canadians , australians or new zealanders , but not `` geographically european '' . 
  however , the russian czars and upper classes speaking french and studying french literature was just an example . 
  russia , in its various forms has been an integral part of europe for a thousand years , with a small intermission of mongol conquest . 
  i frankly ca n't see how you could * not * consider russia `` culturally european '' while simultaneously considering eg . 
  estonia or lithuania as such . 
  it is european , has been for a * long * time . 
  the kievien rus , novgorod , moscow and russia have had a great impact on european politics and history and have participated heavily in european culture . 
  you can easily see this if you just consider that during after the reign of peter the great , the language used by the aristocracy and government was * french * , and remained the language primarily used by the royal family until the russian revolution . 
  yep , when in truth the whole thing is quite straightforward , if you want it to be . 
  the eastern end of europe is the line of the ural mountains , the southern end is the mediterranean - black sea - caucasus - caspian sea line . 
  any country that has territory in these perimeters - including kazakhstan , turkey and russia - is part european . 
  i mean , hungary is portrayed as a grill who thought they were a boy until puberty , and then they married austria . 
  the traffickers packed them tightly in a van , which turned out to be airtight , and so they suffocated . 
  i think it was discovered at the hungarian-austrian border , or a bit further in austria . 
  hungary too . 
  we 're not against it out of solidarity , and neither are the slovaks or the czechs . 
  it 's just that even without south stream , russian gas mostly comes through our countries . 
  now , the eu has shut down south stream - which would have been beneficial to us - because gazprom would have held a stake in the pipes , while they did n't touch north stream - which takes business away from us - even though gazprom will hold a stake in the north stream pipes as well . 
  basically , the eu has screwed us over twice , first by preventing us from developing our business , and secondly by still allowing germany develop similar pipelines that take business away from here . 
  it is my personal opinion , that if south stream had been allowed to be built , hungary , and the other countries that it would have gone through/next to would have no problems with north stream . 
  right now however , it is the eu that seems to be the hypocrite from around here . 
  samsung is notorious for developing a paralel to every single google app there is , and frequently installing both versions on the phone if google requires them to install theirs . 
  this is basically the only way they can get people to use them . 
  i do n't think the numbers will change too much . 
  the drops in numbers were not caused by the cold per se last time either , it was that the aegean sea is a lot rougher in winter . 
  iirc this was made by an austrian chap , around 1850 . 
  explains all the rebelling stuff . 
  i 'm not disputing any of these facts . 
  slavs , bulgarians and vlachs did live in transylvania before the hungarians and the sz\u00e9kelys . 
  magyarisation also happened , and i personally believe it was not the option that should have been pursued . 
  it certainly did have an effect on the literacy rate , however the `` inherent literacy '' at the time of the hungarian conquest , as bigfatliar put it , did not . 
  however , i would n't consider the reunification of hungary and transylvania `` grabbing power '' . 
  as for being the minority , the distribution and percentage of hungarians living in the kingdom of hungary and any specific area fluctuated wildly over the centuries . 
  it went from 55 % -71 % in 900 to a high of 80 % in 1490 to a low of 37,7 % in 1790 to 54,5 % in 1910 if we consider the whole country , and romanians have had a majority in transylvania at least since the end of the ottoman occupation . 
  this statistic also includes croatia , whose population was not subjected to magyarisation . 
  sadly , the push for higher literacy and better education in hungary coincided with nationalist tensions , and our politicians chose the wrong way to resolve this problem - by enforcing the language education of the new and pre-existing primary schools . 
  however , i believe the schools were not forbidden from teaching minority languages , only forced to teach hungarian as well . 
  hungarian also only became codified in 1832 and only became the official state language in 1867 . 
  before that , it was latin , and almost all schools taught in latin . 
  i do n't want to sound like i 'm defending this assimilation policy , as i consider it a too aggressive approach , however after wwi , the native - and i believe 800 + years of local ancestry qualifies them native - minority populations in the areas ceded by austria-hungary experienced assimilation policies at least as severe , or even more agressive than magyarisation was eg : [ romanianization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanianization ) , [ slovakization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slovakization ), 
  the hungarian conquest of transylvania occured in 895 ad . 
  / u/bigfatliar implied that the hungarian settlers arrived only after the reconquest of ottoman lands , however hungarian and sz\u00e9kely populations have lived continously in transylvania since the 10th century . 
  i also highly doubt that the `` inherent literacy rate '' in 895 affected the literacy rate in 1930 . 
  the [ saxons arrived in transylvania during the reign of g\u00e9za ii ( 1141 -- 1162 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transylvanian_saxons ) , again , long before the ottoman conquest . 
  on a semi-related note , would you call someone born in the usa today , whose parents and grandparents were also born there , colonists ? 
  how many generations have to grow up in the area for the people to stop being colonists ? 
  because no group of humans originated from where they live now . 
  the celts once lived on the pannonian plains , yet we do n't call the irish or welsh colonists either . 
  residential rooftop solar energy is twice as expensive as nuclear power generation per kwh . 
  then there are the many polluting materials used in solar panel manufacturing , and the geographical and weather characteristics of the countries - it 's not as easy to replace nuclear energy as it sounds .
