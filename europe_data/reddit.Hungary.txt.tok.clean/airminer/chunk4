  yeah it was n't too much . 
  people did n't want to go to keleti mostly because of the crowd . 
  i did actually see them , while they were in budapest for a couple of weeks . 
  they were wandering around the streets , looking for supermarkets , and were camping at the keleti railway station . 
  people were telling each other not to go to keleti unless they absolutely had to , and later if you did go there , you could almost always find some international crew filming there . 
  because of this , we were a bit more interested in what was happening . 
  but since the fences went up and the people left , they were not in the news , we were n't in the news either , and everything went back to the way it was before .

  this is not about technology . 
  nothing prevents uber from complying with the law . 
  they just do n't want to . 
  according to the law , every taxi driver needs a licence , all taxi cars must be yellow , and marked as taxi cars , all taxi services have to charge the same fixed amount in budapest , and the drivers must give you receipts which were checked with the tax authority over the internet . 
  obviously uber will not comply with any of these things , but it is still a taxi company , and has to comply with these requirements . 
  there are also legal , cheaper alternatives to taxies , if you are willing to sign a contract at the end of your journey ( `` renting a car with a driver '' ) . 
  the thing is , uber is operating illegally in hungary , the courts have found this a year ago . 
  they are n't campaigning for legislation , they are capaining for the enforcement of the law . 
  maybe if there were * two * streams , the other to the south ...

  i know , it 's just hard to define what rules the mta makes . 
  they 're supposed to be who define the vocabulary of the hungarian language , but there 's no equivalent for `` grammatically '' in that sense . 
  anyway , i corrected my post . 
  i 've never heard anyone use `` georgia '' . 
  [ the only people that * do * use it are the foreign ministry since 2011 , but even the geographic committee and the hungarian scientific academy said , that while the foreign ministry is entitled to using georgia , the * right * way to refer to it in everyday life and on maps is * gr\u00fazia * .

  it 's quite impressive how they manage to start every second paragraph with : `` orb\u00e1n is a xenophobic nazi conspiracy theorist , but ... '', 
   without any actual or historical christian background not true at all . 
  [ catholic missionaries first started arriving in japan in 1549 , and at its height , japan is estimated to have had around 300,000 christians .

   `` no , it is not classified as [ terrorism ] , '' lofven said in an interview to the swedish news agency tt . 
  `` there is an international classification regarding what constitutes or does not constitute [ terror ] . 
  as far as i know , the [ knife attacks in israel ] are not defined as terror . '' why would you say that ? 
   later in the day , lofven contacted tt again to clarify his message , fearing what he called a `` misunderstanding . ''  `` i meant that it was unclear if the knife attacks are organized by a group classified as a terrorist organization , '' lofven told the agency . 
  `` nonetheless , the attacks themselves do constitute terror . '' really ? 
  that 's a really weak excuse . 
   on october 30 , 2014 , sweden became the first eu country to officially recognize the state of palestine , a move that was widely criticized by jerusalem . 
  also not true , the former warsaw pact countries recognised palestine in 1988 , and still maintain the recognition . 
  again , nothing this man could have said could have changed anybody 's opinion . 
  also , if he did n't find anything new and interesting - and i think we 've already run out of those - there 's no way the media would continue to report on it . 
  but why would you want to do it at all ? 
  everyone already knows * their * truth , and nothing this man could say can change anyone 's viewpoint .
