  i think `` state '' is more appropriate when talking about the hre . 
  it 's not * just * fructose . 
  and corn syrup is heavily used in the us because corn is so heavily subsidised . 
  it 's also why a lot of things taste worse in the us . 
  it 's a shell for dos . 
  you have to start windows 3.1 from dos , like any other dos program . 
  he has a problem with the fortran part . 
  it 's three days : all hallows eve , all hallows , and the day of the dead - oct 31 , nov 1 and nov 2 . 
  [ neither russia , nor ukraine are signatories to the convention on cluster munitions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convention_on_cluster_munitions#/media/file:cluster_munitions_convention.svg ) , so this does n't infringe on any international treaty . 
  it 's still russian gas , it just comes through the nord stream and germany , not ukraine . 
  * or * we let low cost airlines offer `` refugee tickets '' from turkey to berlin . 
  they would have to be double the price , as under german law iirc the airline has to pay for their deportation to turkey if their application is rejected , and so the airlines do n't let them on their flights . 
  still a lot cheaper than the smugglers though . 
   is a second maidan possible please keep in mind , that in moldova the people are protesting ** against the eu-friendly parties ' coalition ** , as opposed to ukraine . 
  there are a couple of websites which are decent . 
  you can see their bias , but what they report is usually factually correct , they report on most incidents and usually take shots at both sides . 
  if you take highly politicised issues with a pinch of salt , you can get an ok view of the situation . 
  traditional media is fucked , however . 
  it 's easy then !, 
  just fly from the black forest , along the danube , to the black sea !, 
  all i know is cyprus 's inclusion in the eu was hoped to catalyse the creation of a unified state . 
  the european , american , turkish and un politicians campaigned for it , but the leaders of the two cypruses campaigned against it . 
  in the end , a referendum was held in both cypruses , and northern cyprus approved the plan and cyprus rejected it , because they felt it gave turkey too much power over the unified state . 
  after this the council of europe said they were disappointed by the result , and that they 'd work to stop nc 's economic isolation as a result . 
  true , i did n't realize that . 
  fixed . 
  before you decide to downvote longes , read the article . 
  it cites two western-based polls , with realistic percentages , divided down even to ethnicity . 
  i do n't know about you guys , but in hungary no one uses `` roadside pickups '' . 
  we have always phoned for taxies - and taxies only . 
  the one exception to this is at the main international airport , where a single company pays for the right to wait for any passengers directly in front of the arrivals lounge . 
  the only loophole i 've seen so far is `` renting a car with a driver '' , but you have to sign a contract every time you travel with them . 
  [ in the polish version we are brothers . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pole_and_hungarian_cousins_be ) the word itself is `` bratanki '' , which sounds like `` bar\u00e1t '' , and probably has the same origin . 
  they are owned by pepsico . 
  their profits are denominated in usd . 
  names , dates , addresses , light switches , etc. 
  we used to have sugar production in hungary , until a western company bought the factories and razed them to the ground , so that we would have to import their sugar instead . 
  nope hungary is still very much full-cast dubbing everything . 
  of course you * can * watch the movies and some channels subbed , but most people do n't . 
  well , it is still * someone 's * profit generated inside the eu . 
  we could try to tax every single entity outside our borders separately , but the most reasonable answer is to just tax whatever leaves though the borders , and let the other side figure out the rest - which is why the usa is upset . 
  the royalties apple 's eu subsidiaries send to apple hq is the profit apple hq makes in the eu , since it is paid by eu companies ( which happen to be owned by apple ) . 
  thus it should be taxed as profit generated in the eu as well . 
  consumers | | | | - revenue of apple gmbh/kft/ltd / etc.

  v v v v profit should be taxed ( revenue - personnel cost - ip cost ) apple gmbh/kft/ltd / etc.

  how did russia lose to croatia , if both got the same number of votes ? 
  internet purchases generate profit where the consumer purchased it , ie . 
  generally the consumer 's home country , according to eu law . 
  if you look at it like that , a whole lot of profit of these companies is generated in the eu , not even mentioning hardware sales . 
  may said that was n't on the table . 
  there have been opinion polls since . 
  gibraltar residents prefer the uk to the eu if they have to choose . 
  the 1956 revolution was the first time ak-47 were deployed and used by soviet troops in large numbers , and some were captured and used by the rebels as well . 
  interesting to note : some north korean exchange students taught some of the rebels in budapest how to drive the soviet tanks . 
  birth control in itself probably would not have changed population dynamics radically . 
  having a large number of children was not only `` forced '' onto people having sex : it was a logical decision . 
  most deaths occured when the children were young , meaning there would be at least one child , usually more that did n't reach adulthood , necessitatig having more children , even if none had died yet . 
  children also provided a workforce to rely on during harvest , and were the ones who took care of their parents when they could not work the fields any more : in a world without pensions or a way to amass enouggh wealth to last the rest of your life , having children meant not starving to death in your elder days , and having more children meant the burden of helping you would be shared by several working age children . 
  magyarisation only affected thelanguage schools had to use , and afaik did n't affect croatia . 
  the [ hungarian-croatian agreement ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatian%e2%80%93hungarian_settlement ) recognised croatian as one of the two official languages of the lands of the crown of saint stephen , and afaik hungarian language paws did not affect croatia . 
  also : hungary did n't ban the use of any language , it only forced schools to teach every subject , excepting foreign languages in hungarian . 
  private use of the many languages of the kingdoms were not regulated .

  [ that 's how they took buda the last time . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_buda_ ( 1541 \\ ) #siege ) they helped repulse a habsburg attack , then during the celebrations the janissaries filled the streets , pretending to be just looking around . 
  when they were all inside , they took the infant king hostage and declared the city captured . 
  that 's for the courts to decide . 
  yup . 
  it 's because [ article 6 of the north atlantic treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_atlantic_treaty#article_6 ) states that the treaty only covers member nations ' territories in europe and north america , and islands in the north atlantic north of the tropic of cancer , plus french algeria . 
  since the canary islands are north of the tropic of cancer , they are covered , but since spain 's autonomous cities are part of africa , they are not covered . 
  also , according to the us government , hawaii is thus not covered by the treaty , but all the other states of the us are . 
  probably the fact that it borders russia from the south . 
  so the northern flank of nato is at russia 's northern border , the eastern flank of nato is at russia 's western border , etc. 
  nato , as the name suggests only covers the north atlantic , with a few exceptions . 
  because of this , not only are the falklands are not covered by it , but not even spain 's autonomous cities on africa 's northern coast are . 
  not really less radical than the average , maybe a * bit * less radical than the person he replaced . 
  he just happens to be the most successful far-right mayors , and has been the friend of the party leader for a long time . 
  frankly its more interesting why he was * not * a member of the party for so long . 
  now , what i 'm going to say is based on information that was reported by hungarian ( left leaning ) media , that appeared around the time they were arrested , so it may be out of date , or just plain false , but here is what the accused have said about this whole thing : according to them , the guy they arrested owns an airsoft field , and makes airsoft bombs for use on this field - which is what the police confiscated when they were arrested . 
  he and an other leader of the organisation then joked on the phone about blowing up something during the parade , which led to their arrests . 
  now this is straight from the horses ' mouth , so it may very well be that they are lying , i just thought i 'd share what they said about this whole shebang . 
  while i do n't agree with their ideology , and it is generally not advised to joke about blowing something up in the country you live in , i do n't believe this classifies them as terrorists ( yet ) . 
  if they were indeed making preparations for an attack , then fair enough , but i guess that is for the investigation to decide . 
  a party can choose anyone they want to put on the party list . 
  it 's not restricted to official , card carrying members . 
  it does n't happen often , but sometimes it does . 
  also , a `` purge '' of the more radical elements happened since in the jobbik leadership , and he was asked to join the party and fill the role . 
  they will both practice shooting at each other . 
  [ great grandfather ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ali_kemal ), 
  romanesque churches have thick walls and small windows because ( among other things ) they served to protect the villagers in case of an attack . 
  so building church-bunkers is just going back to the roots .
