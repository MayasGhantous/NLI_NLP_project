   pay people to invest in your country ? 
  the bonds they buy are basically no-interest loans to the government , and because of inflation the government actually has to pay less back then what they borrowed . 
  now , i do have problems with the program , but not on a philosophical level : the bonds are not sold by the government itself but through companies of unclear background , which profit greatly from inflating the price of the bonds , which is extra profit the state is `` throwing away '' . 
  i think you misunderstood him . 
  he asked if a black immigrant in portugal would be more disliked than a black immigrant in russia . 
  malta does as well . 
  it 's nothing new , and has been going on for years . 
  we do actually check they are children , unlike some other countries . 
  some people would be probably a lot more receptive to it if it was just called the `` bribe budget '' , although it would probably upset a few people as well . 
  [ he got a mandarin interpreter , singed an asylum application , got fingerprinted , got meals , spending money and shelter for 12 days before someone noticed something was up ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/08/chinese-tourist-who-lost-wallet-in-germany-ends-up-in-refugee-shelter ), 
  did n't merkel compliment the fences when she visited ceuta or melilla back in 2009 or 2011 ? 
  i certainly remember something of that sort . 
   keep the level up what level ? 
  the level of baselessly claiming hungary sold weapons to isis ? 
  we basically do n't even have an arms industry , for fucks sake !, 
  no one has violated the right to asylum . 
  hungary has treaties with the non-eu balkan countries , saying that they are generally safe * source * countries , and barring exceptional circumstances asylum seekers from there can be sent back - a similar policy exists in germany as well . 
  so , the thinking goes , the countries must be * generally * safe * third countries * as well - as in ones where the asylum seekers pass through . 
  since the geneva convention only obligates countries to take refugees if they are not coming from a safe third country , hungary asks for proof that the asylum seekers have applied for asylum in serbia and have been rejected . 
  in fact most migrants have not applied for asylum in serbia , and do not plan to apply for one in hungary - but most who did apply left the country before a decision was made on granting them asylum . 
  mind you , unaccompanied children will be given asylum with no questions asked , as set out in hungarian law . 
  fun fact : the city wall used to run next to k\u00e1lvin square , and some new buildings were built on top of it : [ a section of it was still visible in 1980 ] ( https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/pest_v%c3%a1rosfalai_%c3%a9s_v%c3%a1ros%c3%a1rka#/media/file:pest_v%c3%a1rosfal%c3%a1nak_maradv%c3%a1nya_a_calvin_t%c3%a9ren,_1981.jpg ), 
  fyi : you should put a backslash in front of the closing bracket in your link , like this : [ `` have fun '' and `` take videos of the scenery '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cavalese_cable_car_disaster_ ( 1998 \\ ) ) [ fixed link ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cavalese_cable_car_disaster_ ( 1998 \\ ) ), 
  norway , a country which produces more electricity just from hydroelectric dams than it needs , and that had to cancel the tax exemptions they gave to electric vehicles because they reached their ten-year target in a two years . 
  not every country has the geography to support that much cheap renewable electricity generation . 
  they just want to make life hard for the crimeans , so that they think life was better under ukraine . 
  it makes me wonder if they went for `` senior justice writer '' just because of the acronym . 
  since black people are basically nonexistent outside the capital , i 'd wager a black person has * never * been shot by a hungarian policeman . 
  i mean i personally ca n't stand suggested spellings like `` l\u00e1jk '' and '' \u00edm\u00e9l '' , and would rather we just kept the original spelling or translated them properly . 
  not everyone is taught that . 
  [ yes .

  yes , though it was only buda back then . 
  [ here is the list and dates of the historical capitals of hungary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_historical_capitals_of_hungary ), 
  hungary , the czech republic and slovakia are generally against the sanctions on russia . 
  it is only poland that takes a hardline anti-russian stance . 
  referenda in the uk are just advisory . 
  the government has no legal obligation to follow them . 
  blue is pro-eu on every map . 
  it helps if you consider that rural areas are usually against it . 
  i feel absolutely the same way as well . 
  even their accent when speaking english is what i would consider a typical hungarian accent . 
  rules about farming and fishing and subsidising them , mostly . 
  they train themselves . 
  there was a video about an organised fight yesterday on the front page . 
  the two groups line up , then start pummeling each other , with a pre-agreed `` safe position '' for those who have had enough . 
  after enough practice they go to a football match and reenact this , without the saftey features . 
  ultras are trained and practice fighting opposing ultras . 
  its the same in the eu too : hungary , romania , etc. 
  afaik international treaties say that a state ca n't strip citizenship from someone if they would become stateless as a result . 
  thus a lot of states do strip citizenship , provided the offenders have an other . 
  dual citizenship just happens more often in some places than others . 
   [ article 6 states that the treaty only covers member nations ' territories in europe and north america , and islands in the north atlantic north of the tropic of cancer , plus french algeria .

  she already has a political career - one of the parties got her elected to the parliament on their list - first place on the list , even - while she was imprisoned . 
  it 's a nebulous concept , but [ the main idea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/populism ) is that populists empathise with the public , often through rhetoric and unrealistic proposals , to increase their appeal across the political spectrum . 
  in other words , they play on the populations ' hopes and fears to gain votes . 
  as i said , there is no proper definition , and there is debate whether it is a useful category at all , but i guess in general one could say that parties that rely mostly on using the hopes and fears of the electorate instead of relying on ideology get labelled populist . 
  the article did say `` right wing populist and far right '' , hence why the tories are not coloured either . 
  mi\u00c9p still definitely should have been coloured , but i would n't call eg . 
  ( pre-fidesz ) kdnp either populist or far-right . 
  italy has many unique surnames based on local features , etc. 
  they are not looking at names like smith . 
  just because you asked nicely  the [ velociraptor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/velociraptor ) had been extinct for 3 million years by the time the [ t. rex ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tyrannosaurus ) appeared .

  has he lost them for a decade ? 
  almost centrally . 
  can pro-eu politician fuck up hard enough to make russia popular again ? 
  probably . 
  who will it help that ukraine will never be accepted into the eu or nato under the current circumstances ? 
  yeah . 
  being surrounded by slavic languages on most sides tends to do that . 
  origin of word roots in hungarian | percentage : -- | : -- uncertain | 30 % uralic | 21 % slavic | 20 % german | 11 % turkic | 9.5 % latin and greek | 6 % romance | 2.5 % other known | 1 %,

  we have a small river flotilla for laying and removing mines and a couple of icebreakers we lend to serbia every winter .

  sorry , did n't see your flag on mobile . 
  that 's not entirely true . 
  while generally slanted marks signify a difference in length , in the case of \u00c1 and \u00c9 they signify a difference in sound as well . 
  the short version of \u00c9 is \u00cb , which is not used in the standard dialect and thus did n't make it into the standard alphabet . 
  different dialects use ~ 12 different es , but \u00cb is the most common , and was the closest to getting incorporated into the alphabet , since it distinguished the meaning of several words that are homophones in the standard dialect and what language pronounces y as \u00fc ? 
  german ? 
  o \u00d3 \u00d6 \u0150 u \u00da \u00dc \u0170 i \u00cd e \u00c9 a \u00c1 !,

  they still have more unionist seats than nationalist ones . 
  40 unionist to 39 nationalist in a chamber of 90 . 
  it 's still a big deal , but to say that `` ni as a whole rejected unionism and backed nationalism '' is inaccurate . 
  * someone * voted for your government as well . 
  if the eu truly disintegrates , i do n't think our countries will be invited to whatever successor western europe comes up with . 
  [ the words for `` 1 '' and `` 7 '' are ours only .
