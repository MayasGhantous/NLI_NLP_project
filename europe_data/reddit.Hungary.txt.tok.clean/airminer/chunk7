  you ca n't be racist against white people . 
  that 's because the eu thought membership would lead to reunification . 
  [ a deal was prepared by the un , turkey the us and the eu , which included unconditional eu membership and a referendum on reunification . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/annan_plan_for_cyprus ) the north voted yes on the referendum , however the south voted no since they thought the deal gave too much power to the turks . 
  this shocked both the eu and the us , however because they already agreed to unconditionally admit cyprus to the union , they could n't do anything about it . 
  the night theme on this subbreddit is/was a night view of budapest and the danube, 
  we buy our nuclear fuel from russia , and the contract used to include waste disposal as well - they would take the spent fuel and take care of it themselves . 
  they also have breeder reactors , meaning they can reuse our spent fuel , and not just bury it . 
  this flag was used as civil ensign from 1869 up until 1918 . 
  the black-gold flag was the flag of the whole empire untill 1867 , but after that it was only used for the austrian half . 
  90k overall 50k in bucharest according to the updated numbers . 
  because you took our salt mines , and yugoslavia took our sea . 
  welcome back to the club !, 
  most of the gop seem to be with trump on this one , and you can hardly call them `` alt-right '' . 
  how would you define a `` legitimate political movement '' ? 
  the soviet union asked to join nato when it was founded . 
  it was rejected ( for obvious reasons ) . 
   less than half of all foreign aid money goes to where it 's intended to . 
  well that depends on what you think its * intended * destination was . 
  quite a few countries explicitly use `` aid money '' as bribes . 
  [ here is a handy list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_involving_poland ) . 
  just search for hungary/hungarian . 
  we did also regularly fight on the same side as well and even intervened in each others ' civil wars . 
  we did invade / raid poland quite a few times in the middle ages , just as they did so with us . 
  ridiculing may get your opponents to shut up . 
  it may even get you the poll numbers you want . 
  but when people go to vote , and nobody 's looking they will vote how they * really * feel . 
  we have seen this a couple times last year already . 
  let 's not make the same mistakes . 
  trump won the republican primary and was endorsed by almost all republicans as their candidate . 
  i know . 
  he suggested bill being first lady * and * vp as well, 
  most romani in hungary only speak hungarian . 
  the eu presidency is probably larger than malta :p, 
  what would happen if hillary died in office ? 
  would bill be skipped when determining the acting president , since he had already served two terms ? 
  tell me : how is the russian ambassador to turkey personally responsible for the war in ukraine ? 
  or for that matter whatever happens in aleppo ? 
  or is your argument based only on good old collective responsibility and racism ? 
  a black flag is used to signify grief in many countries that used to be part of the austrian empire . 
  in hungary a black flag will be flown on any public institution where an employee has recently died . 
  [ slavic loanword according to wikitionary ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/csoda ), 
  the entente eats cats !, 
  how did that work out for libya ? 
  russia mostly did it to secure their military installations in sevastopol and to keep ukraine out of nato and the eu . 
  and while the circumstances of the crimean referendum were clearly not what one would hope for , it has been clear for a very long time , through independently verified opinion polls among other things , that ever since ukraine 's independence a large majority of crimeans would have preferred it to belong to russia . 
  he said he would withdraw a part of the russian force , which he did . 
  i think every single person in hungary would agree with you on that . 
  even those very few who take revisionism seriously . 
  they are currently not part of hungary . 
  [ this is what most memorials look like . 
  ] ( http://m.cdn.blog.hu/mi/miskolcadhatott/image/miskolic_trianon_emlekmu.jpg ) it is * supposed * to be separate slabs , the glue just gave way . 
  now it is . 
  it was the location of the diets of the kingdom of hungary , the royal seat , and where the kings were crowned and buried between 1000 -- 1543ad , and was one of the centers of the principality of hungary before that . 
  in 1543 the ottoman empire captured it and most people living there fled . 
  it was only finally retaken in 1688 , and while it did become an important regional city , it never reached the importance it held before . 
  we used to have a lot of swamps in the territory of current day hungary . 
  most of them were drained in the 19th century . 
  also as for s\u00e1rk\u00f6zi 's name : we have a river , called `` s\u00e1rv\u00edz '' ( mudwater ) . 
  ' - k\u00f6z ' means `` the area between '' , in this case `` s\u00e1rk\u00f6z '' means `` the area between mud ( water ) ( and the danube ) '' . 
  ' - i ' also means `` from '' . 
  so `` s\u00e1rk\u00f6zi '' means '' ( something/someone ) from the area between mud ( water ) ( and the danube ) '', 
  yep , the ` k ' at the start of shared words turned into ` h ' in hungarian . 
  s&d as a whole wanted to lift the sanctions , while the epp wanted to keep them . 
  the hungarian parties voted the same way as their respective groups , despite their rhetoric in hungary . 
  if libya calms down . 
  actually there have been several instances of white south africans in the us applying for `` african american '' grants , winning them , then getting denied when the grantee realised they were white . 
  another legend says that one of the design requirements was that the parliament had to be at least one meter larger than the british parliament in every dimension . 
  well , budapest has quite enough land as it is . 
  the population was decreasing due to suburbanisation , and with the exception of the city center , we do n't have a housing or office space shortage that would necessitate very high buildings . 
  also a couple of facts about building heights in hungary : the parliament and the saint stepehn basilica , both in budapest are the second and third highest buildings in the * country * , each 96m high , originally symbolising the balance of temporal power and spiritual authority ( though the parliament is * slightly * higher ) . 
  the highest building is the esztergom basilica with 100 meters in height , which is because esztergom has been the center of the catholic church in hungary since 1000ad, 
  in the uk you would say that it is a [ listed building ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/listed_building ) . 
  eggs have a protective outermost layer ( the cuticle ) which gets destroyed by washing them . 
  this layer helps keep the egg from spoiling , and helps them resist resist salmonella entering through the porous shell . 
  [ yep ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/succession_of_states#soviet_union ), 
   while miniature horses are the size of a very small pony , many retain horse characteristics and are considered `` horses '' by their respective registries . 
  so they are smaller than most ponies . 
  a `` neutral third party '' is hard to come by , especially in a digital election system . 
  in our paper based system , you do not need to trust the system to remain anonymous : you need to trust it to count every anonymous vote , and report the count accurately . 
  to this end , every vote counting committee is composed of multiple people with conflicting goals and interests , and a number of observers , all checking whether the ballots are properly counted , to increase the number of people needed to falsify the count . 
  each voting counting committee ideally only being responsible for a relatively insignificant share of the votes . 
  even after this , if you still suspect wrongdoing you can request a recount . 
  during the recount , the number of votes cast will also be compared to the sum of votes counted . 
  a system like you are describing would make it impossible for a third ( fourth ? ), 
  party to verify the results of an election ( analogously a recount ) , while also severely reducing the number of people ( or computers ) you have to influence to compromise the supposedly neutral third party . 
  well , in hungary you are n't allowed to vote by mail if you have a permanent address in hungary . 
  you have to vote at a voting booth , an embassy , consulate or a portable voting booth they bring to you if eg . 
  you are in hospital . 
  i know this is n't practical in very sparsely populated areas , but the easiest `` fix '' would be to disallow voting by mail for anyone who lives in a reasonable distance of a polling booth . 
  i have n't personally voted by mail ever ( as i 'm not allowed to ) , so i do n't have specific insight into how they are formatted or checked . 
  i 'd have to ask someone else how they handle this in countries where voting by mail is more universal . 
  in all modern democracies , votes are private , and any votes with identifiable information are void and not counted . 
  someone * can * hold your family hostage , but you can still vote for the other party , and they wo n't be able to tell if you did . 
  basically , they can not accompany you into the voting booth , and ca n't tell if a specific vote is yours or not ( unless absolutely no one voted for their preferred choice ) afterwards either . 
  if you do put something identifying on the ballot , your vote is spoilt and not counted . 
  they do n't even have to watch in person . 
  just ask for their blockchain id , and check the public blockchain after the election . 
  if the blockchain is n't public , then an independent recount of the vote transactions is impossible , and the government can just lie about how many votes they received . 
  it does not .
