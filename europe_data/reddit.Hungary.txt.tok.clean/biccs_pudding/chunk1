yeah , a certain historical period is called `` the turk blight '' around here for lolzies . 
  the perception certainly improved after the deal . 
  before compromise : `` muh sovereignty !, 
  austria is the cancer of the world !, 
  filthy inbred tyrants , hope they all die out ! '', 
  after compromise : `` omg golden age , bff , world power !, 
  let 's stomp the slavs together !, 
  the habsburgs are still shitheads though . '', 
  after ww2 : `` i 'd really rather clean habsburg toilets again . 
  such great fellows . '', 
  good times . 
  curse you in-laws for being the same but nicer . 
  seems to be a quality series . 
  thanks for sharing . 
  totally unexpected . 
  hungary has the krampus as well , ( as do most of the former habsburg territories ) but they do n't do much aside from being nicholas 's scary sidekicks . 
  you ca n't find them by themselves giving random scares , which is something we should definitely reintroduce if you ask me . 
  ca n't wait for the annual shitstorm on kossuth square . 
  tradition never dies . 
  ^ yes , ^ i ^ went ^ there . 
  i relied more on what the elders and my own grandparents told me about the olden days . 
  according to them it was n't nearly this bad before the wars . 
  regardless , it 's not the same world as it was under stalinist rule . 
  we should at least try to be less obnoxious to be around . 
  a smile every now and then does n't cost anything . 
  i do n't think it 's about pride . 
  the cashier lady does n't flash you a smile asking how your day went because they won the world wars . 
  the cars do n't almost immediately stop before the crosswalk to let you through because they used to own the biggest colonial empire . 
  it 's simple human decency that somehow died out in post-commie countries . 
  trust me , they are nowhere near hungarians on that front . 
  considering the climate they have to live with that 's actually a small wonder . 
  i first noticed it when i lived in the uk for some time . 
  i did n't miss the bitterness and constant bitching about literally everything at all . 
  when i returned it started to bug me more . 
  the other thing is the general small-mindedness , hostility and living in the past . 
  when you read the comments on any given performance or movie or whatever in english , you have neutral , positive and negative ones of about equal proportions ( unless something is really that atrocious ) , the same thing on a hungarian forum will get 80 % negative at the least . 
  the so called `` educated '' demographic are not excluded at all . 
  it 's beyond toxic . 
  sure , given the region 's history some cynicism is guaranteed , but most are just out of the ballpark for me . 
  nowadays i converse more with americans or other westerners than my own countrymen . 
  it just feels better . 
  i like living in hungary , it 's a nice enough place , but ca n't stand the people . 
  i would n't use present tense . 
  minorities of today can do whatever they like . 
  since i apparently invented this phrase , i 'd consider someone from hungarian descent who does n't actually speak the language fluently anymore a non-vanilla . 
  sz\u00e9kelys are n't that different from us at all , i found . 
  i know . 
  i can still find it unfortunate . 
  i did n't issue it personally , you know . 
  i found it interesting , thanks for sharing . 
  pity that their language did n't survive in the region . 
  they 're pretty much indistinguishable from vanilla hungarians at this point . 
  orb\u00e1n & lackeys oppose it because it would leave them with even less leverage . 
  i 'm pretty sure the public would welcome the inclusion of slovenia or croatia for example . 
  well , gloomy sunday * was * a huge hit back in the day . 
  the party never dies . 
  the frozen song actually said that in the dub . 
  ( `` legyen h\u00f3 '' = `` let there be snow '' ), 
  if the * wages * were attractive there would be no need for foreign labour to settle in the first place , who would n't want to come here even if we spoke esperanto anyways . 
  for the same reason of course . 
  beautiful sights , great climate , rich history , and has such character to it that keeps drawing me back . 
  sure , wages are not the best but that would be nothing new . 
  orb\u00e1n expects turkey to `` open the dam '' in the near future which would start a new and even stronger wave that the current measures would n't be able to withstand . 
  or something . 
  truth be told with erdogan you never know , illiberal buddy or not . 
  i went to a primary school named after j\u00f3zef bem . 
  guy 's a very revered figure . 
  one thing that a religious polish coworker once pointed out was how big jadwiga 's name is out there ( daughter of louis the great of hungary who later married into the polish royals and became a saint ) . 
  i previously had no idea . 
  i recommend taking a canoe trip on the danube between esztergom and \u0160t\u00farovo . 
  it 's an experience out of a fantasy novel . 
  are you familiar with numbers ? 
  you know , the ones that those `` slightly different shades of green '' represent maybe ? 
  sweden 's `` green '' and hungary 's `` green '' are in wildly different leagues . 
  a `` norm '' on what planet ? 
  take a glimpse at the english-speaking capacity of eastern europe [ here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/knowledge_of_english_eu_map.svg/2000px-knowledge_of_english_eu_map.svg.png ) , or the tertiary education levels [ here ] ( http://www.bbsr.bund.de/bbsr/en/spatialdevelopment/spatialdevelopmenteurope/analysesspatialdevelopment/projects/education/images/tertiaerabschluss_diagramm.gif?__blob=normal&amp;v=1 ) ( that one does n't reach 50 % anywhere btw ) . 
  all the `` special '' treatment these people crave is at least half-decent salaries . 
  fuck them , right ? 
  as long as they keep paying peanuts to highly educated , foreign-language-speaking people and strangle companies with taxes , the flow will never stop . 
  simple as that . 
  i do n't blame the emigrants , you only have one life that you would n't want to spend with poverty and day-to-day struggles if they are just not necessary . 
  since everyone and their mom has an opinion about migrants these days , plus the well-oiled fidesz propaganda machine doing its job diligently as always , i do n't really doubt that the 50 % threshold will be met but we 'll see . 
  frankly , i 'm as critical towards the resettlement scheme as the next person but i also do n't want to give political leverage about anything to orb\u00e1n and his cronies . 
  if the `` no '' wins - which it obviously will , as orb\u00e1n knows fully well - it 'd just have this anti-establishment vibe and would count as yet another tantrum from the `` ungrateful '' easterners . 
  except in this case they are sort of right , just not for the right reasons . 
  i 'd rather have this same poll in a country with some actual involvement in policymaking ( preferebly in one that already accepted at least some refugees ) . 
  the same thing that counts as some joke if it comes from us could be serious turnpoints in eu politics a bit more to the west . 
  we should have just sat this one out silently and watch a failed policy sort itself out . 
  same in hungary ( with the exact same plans of importing ukrainians in the future ) . 
  on one hand i sort of understand the companies ' plight , even if they were to raise the wages to 700 $ for manufacturing jobs it would n't really stop the majority of emigrants from taking the same job in we for 1000 $ or so . 
  on the other hand they sure as hell should at least try , and maybe lure back the workers who are now opting for the in-between solution of slovakia ( that 's a thing now , the slovaks that the same greedy businessmen smugly looked down upon not so long ago are now so far ahead of us in economic perspectives that it 's not even funny . ), 
  hard rock hallelujah pt .2 and nun dancers in terrifying makeup or gtfo . 
  misleading question . 
  i do n't think 83 % of greeks or 77 % of hungarians think they should n't help other countries at all ( sure , a lot of them might think just that , but not nearly this many ) . 
  it has more to do with the sheer amount of shit they have to deal with in their own country and how that needs fixing first before they could even be any help to anyone . 
  i think it was intentional misleading on \u00c1rp\u00e1d and co 's part so he could use the huns ' fearsome reputation on their own raids . 
  they knew western clerics would n't bother to distinguish one barbarian horde from another , and common folk adore legends , so give 'em some nimrod and magic stags 'n shit . 
  maria theresa is a decent choice , one of the few ( if not only ) habsburg rulers that all the legacy nations respect to some degree . 
  if hungary ever gets its own civ ( hey , if poland did then it 's not impossible ) , then either stephen i or matthias corvinus would be the most suitable imo . 
  tell that to the dozens of attilas , r\u00e9kas , csabas etc.
