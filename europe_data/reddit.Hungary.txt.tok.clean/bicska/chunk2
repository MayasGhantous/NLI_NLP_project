  erlangen is great, 
  based on the same reasoning croatia should be still part of yugoslavia , or god forbid the hungarian kingdom . 
  i \u00b4 m afraid it is about the solution of the situation in syria together with russia . 
  [ attack against the border ] ( http://police.hu/hirek-es-informaciok/legfrissebb-hireink/zsaru-magazin/tamadas-a-hatar-ellen ) [ coping ] ( http://police.hu/hirek-es-informaciok/legfrissebb-hireink/zsaru-magazin/helytallas ) ( with the situation ) spin can go both ways ... 
  a lot changed since 2008 . 
  that time russia claimed it is about russia \u00b4 s security concern . 
  the us respected it , and backed down , especially after the georgian war became obvious russia is ready to act on it \u00b4 s words . 
  then the eu accession/partnership became the central focus , as it is an economic and political organization and no cold war history . 
  but russia forced ukraine into backing down from that too . 
  that \u00b4 s when it became obvious russia \u00b4 s opposition was never about its security concerns , but not wanting ukraine and other countries getting out of its orbit . 
  good old imperialism . 
  now , even actively helping eastern ukrainian rebels , the kremlin lost all talking points of self defense and reasonable demands . 
  and as an extra outcome more and more ukrainians became pro nato , which was a divisive issue , and it wasn \u00b4 t just simply an east-west ukraine divide . 
  russia lost all good will in the west , bleeding money , started another foreign military adventure in syria , i really don \u00b4 t see how they can get out of it with a win . 
  unless they can make the immigration crisis worse and europe will bow . 
  his first encounter sounded like skinheads , the second as gypsies . 
  i \u00b4 m confused . 
  interestingly , in hungary one guy was caught among the migrants with * 7 passports * to his name , all with schengen visas ... 
  yeah , our government is going too far for cheap natural gas imo, 
  there was one picture with oral action, 
  no , he made a joint press conference with the csu in bavaria earlier today . 
  there were no specifics mentioned concerning this idea . 
  he and the mfa said several times : the policy will not solve the situation but we will lose time and it takes attention off of the main problem : the large influx of people . 
  that should be stopped first . 
  if the quotas will be obligatory hungary will comply , but it will use every possible means to evade * the introduction * of obligatory quotas . 
  now as there are quotas , then make it as small as possible by enlarging the pool of receiving countries imo . 
  ** update ** : * all proposals have been accepted by the heads of states and governments * except * the first , the most important in the short run * the austrian chancellor said he prefers the rush of migrants in austria over a fence in hungary , hungary will take it into consideration the 6 proposals : * greece hands over the protection of its borders to the eu * refugees and economic migrants separated * outside * the eu * safe country list made on eu level , eu members by default will be safe [ other sources mentioned candidate countries too as safe by default ] * everyone should cut spending by 1 % and income by 1 % , this would provide 3 billion euros for the crisis handling [ other sources mentioned it should repeated as many times as necessary ] * develop special partnership with key countries as turkey , but the relationship with russia must be rethought also * refugees should be distributed all around the world , not just in the eu, 
   not total control as we 've seen by some here , but some level of control . 
  i see , that is ok then . 
   because gmos can greatly increase crop yields and nutritional value . 
  by increasing nutrient intake . 
  we already have more food than we need . 
  why have more ? 
  last week both hungary and serbia provided first aid . 
  it depended on which side of the police line you ended up . 
   and there 's no way to control how or why a user chooses to vote . 
  that is kind of the point ... 
  yes , like everything else . 
  what is your point ? 
   i have serious doubts any of these people would attack armed soldiers . 
  they already attacked policemen . 
  a large number of people showing up in a mass , breaking the laws and demanding benefits . 
  what else could you call it ? 
  of course , and borders are just imaginary lines , and immigrants can do no bad as they are opressed ... 
  anything else i missed ? 
  the death couldn \u00b4 t be the result of attacking for example a uniformed soldier . 
  it can be only the result of a policy . 
  come on ... 
  why cutting drastically ? 
   we do n't ban people based on what they do outside of the subreddit , but we do take what you do outside of our subreddit into account fair enough . 
   ( although some do post exclusively to / r/europe ... which even i find odd ) what could be the reason i wonder, 
   monitor a users entire comment history so you do ban people based on where they are active or what they say outside this sub ? 
  except one guy ... 
  `` sweeping new powers '' they are allowed now to * help * the police . 
  they can not do anything on their own . 
  we could already feed about 10 billion . 
  hunger is a distribution , not a production issue . 
  * after * people are taken off of the ship . 
  hungarian press claimed this information leaked to the croatian press . 
  :d they can \u00b4 t because the fence is there , they have to go to romania , but the fence is already being built there too . 
  croatian press what i \u00b4 ve heard . 
  using : * police * military * inmates and prison guards * those unemployed who are in the public works program ( about 200 000 people ) spending months working first slowly , then speeding up the process . 
  i just been told by a friend that he saw 5 km fenced up literally overnight . 
  he said , all you heard first is a buzzing getting closer and closer in the night . 
  send ships and police to greece , italy , spain . 
  take border control seriously , sink smuggler ships . 
  update : * train traffic suspended between the two countries, 
  your government offered a week ago to send policemen or military to hungary . 
  yes , i \u00b4 ve seen , but all hotels booked for policemen and military at the border . 
  at 19:55 the real 3m high fence being built . 
  the gate put in place . 
  i think they are closing it off . 
  already building the first 70km piece . 
  they can abolish it only if it will be federalized . 
  if brussels gets its hand on this topic i \u00b4 m afraid we will end up with a `` welcome everyone '' policy . 
  those in brussels are extremely on the left , and lost touch with reality . 
  i mean speaking up now , in the current situation . 
  what is the general story they present ? 
  iron curtain was built to keep people * in * certain countries , so it doesn \u00b4 t have to democratize . 
  todays fences are built to keep people * out * from certain countries , so it can keep up democratic values ( especially rights of women , gays , etc. ), 
  uk media outlets seem to be out of touch with reality in this crisis , even the bbc tried to paint an imagined world earlier . 
  i \u00b4 m sure , once police will get fed up , they won \u00b4 t be so tolerant of bullshit like this . 
  austrian politicians still trying to look humane , but public opinion is already changing and so will politicians . 
  i agree with you . 
  unskilled labour , menial tasks , illegally . 
  i think what people meant were skilled positions . 
  working illegally in germany would still mean a higher level of living than welfare in hungary, 
  i thought so about camps too, 
  ... * fence * ... 
  i imply that our md that time wasn \u00b4 t the best and appeared in public drunk more than once, 
  not running or protecting them . 
  ( why are you fixated on libya ? ), 
  nothing stops them from trying again , but if x has to try again , x is not in europe . 
  there is a big difference between a million getting in or 10 000 . who cares if they stay in the camp ? 
  they will get basic services there , if they have a better idea , please go on !, 
  helping to defend the border . 
  what is so difficult in understanding this ? 
  point is it was so common sense that even commenters mentioned it over and over again . 
  finally !, 
  germany is proposing a workable long term solution .
