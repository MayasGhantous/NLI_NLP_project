  not that feel-good everyone-welcome bullshit . 
  of course how would those refugees dare to be a problem for those on hajj . 
  not using those tents most of the year is obviously the optimal solution . 
  temporary of course, 
  so if people do not agree with you anymore ... you leave ? 
  allright, 
  only finno-ugrics are doing sensible things nowadays ? 
  it is used as a temporary measure , not as the only one . 
   borders do not really exist except on map of course ... 
  refreshing to see a politician not giving a fuck anymore of political correctness, 
  the empire was weak by wwi, 
  the razorwire , ~ ~ temporal ~ ~ temporary fence for now . 
  i guess they were prepared for such an eventuality . 
  this whole fence project didn \u00b4 t start last week . 
  in a storage unit ? 
  the military . 
  and that will bring into the debate italy . 
  slovakia-ukraine border already has a fence . 
  if poland fences up migrants are in trouble as belarus is not famous for it \u00b4 s humanitarian record , crossing ukraine-russia border is questionable too . 
  and it seems they are carrying on to cover the rest of the border . 
  edit : beremend , where most migrants entered in the last 24 hours was cleared of the press . 
  and they don \u00b4 t understand why are they getting so few votes lately ... 
  hungary has no tanks . 
  during the last or before the last socialist government they were all scrapped . 
  the resoning : `` tanks are pointless investment , as they can be destroyed '', 
  to make it even less clear : hungary had transportation ready at all of the border crossing points on the croatian-hungarian border . 
  ( there aren \u00b4 t that many ), 
  sending men and equipment in substantial numbers to greece and bulgaria would be a start . 
  in hungary too ... 
  let me guess tomorrows headlines : `` slovenian police attacks helpless refugees '' ( crying kids on picture ) `` slovenian authorities pull refugees over themselves and force them to hit police ! '', 
  it is not clear what will happen . 
  as the situation is now , i wouldn \u00b4 t be surprised if they would show up back in croatia in a day or two . 
  hungary should troll back by waiting a day or two until the new fence is done and 20-30 000 migrants are held up in the country . 
  and * then * deporting everyone back to croatia . 
  reading this article i realized this is the first time anyone from the media asked hungarians what they think about the fence . 
  legally they are not present anywhere at the border , exactly because it is not legal yet . 
  but if you look at the pictures since monday , they are everywhere , they just don \u00b4 t intervene yet . 
  hungarys problem : before croatia joined the eu : `` we are bff , yea thanks for the help speeding up our eu joining procedure ! '', 
  croatia joins the eu : `` fuck you hungary ! '', 
  the army is already there , it was there when milanovic said that . 
  when asked about building a fence , he said he doesn \u00b4 t like it ... 
  typical leftist `` feels before reals '', 
  that \u00b4 s hardcore . 
  we should get as much raw footage as possible . 
  the minefield is inside croatian territory . 
  on the hungarian border there are no mines . 
  croatian buses , than croatian trains . 
  there are about 4300 people now in that camp . 
  about 15 kms from the hungarian and maybe 30 from the serbian border . 
  yes i have seen ... let the spanish have fun with him . 
  like that guy who was tripped by that camerawomen . 
  index.hr might be the same company as index.hu ? 
  they usually say things like that too . 
  people were taken to the hungarian border too , to the baranya ( what is it in croatian ? ), 
  triangle . 
  so far 1500 , and 900 is on the way on a train . 
  [ `` croatia will not be able to receive more people , '' interior minister ranko ostojic ] ( http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/eu-rebukes-hungary-as-refugee-crisis-tensions-escalate/41664676 ), 
  but you are a soldier ... if you go to a pow camp , you don \u00b4 t get your special place for `` non-combatant enemies '', 
  you don \u00b4 t have to blow yourself up to be a member of a terrorist organization . 
  check my edit, 
  like croatia : * tuesday : `` no migrants will come here . '', 
  * wednesday : `` they are coming , but we can handle the situation . '', 
  * thursday : `` we can not handle them !, 
  help ! '', 
  ( * quietly dumping them on hungary and slovenia * ), 
  was watching the live coverage on m1 yesterday . 
  they broke the news first , than the clarification too . 
  ** edit ** : newer clarification : both things below are true . 
  so : the guy was inciting violance at the border * and * is a known terrorist ---------------------------------------------------------------- ~ ~ the police made a clarification later on . 
  he was not a `` known terrorist '' in the sense of someone known before and connected to terrorist groups . ~ ~ ~ ~ the guy caught was inciting other migrants to attack hungarian police . 
  this constitutes terrorism according to hungarian laws . ~ ~, 
  the guy being all edgy and `` saying it '' , still uses a generic `` eastern european '' instead of saying it for real who those people in duisburg are : `` gypsy '' what \u00b4 s wrong in germany ? 
  even if you are a confrontational bad boy , you are pc ? 
  i see stop and yield signs are painted on the road , instead of proper signs . 
  let me ask , does it have anything to do with `` metal recycling entrepreneurs '' ? 
  it seems from that specific place they started to go to hungary :(, 
  it is not sensationalist , it is a mainstream media outlet . 
  there is no printed version , they started out online-only right from the beginning in 1996 or 1997 . 
  ( that time it was internetto.hu ), 
  migrants broke through the police : https://skynews.grabyo.com/g/v/zg6miiinhnl, 
   in the past we removed a lot of meta posts because we felt like they were n't adding anything to the subreddit discussing moderation , topic flooding , questionable mod actions are how not adding anything to the subreddit ?

  thanks i \u00b4 ll post it to the croatia thread !, 
  you are right , my english is far from perfect . 
  titles can not be edited :(, 
  it \u00b4 s not tabloid at all . 
  it is a left/liberal news site , and the largest in hungary . 
  now there are tabloid and specialized parts , but specifically separated , under `` velvet '' for tabloid , `` totalcar '' for cars etc. 
  starts at 0:19 , when the guys on the roof are shown . 
  `` the migrants have made threats they 'll break down the fence at the tovarnik train station if a train does n't arrive soon ( to pick them up ) '' just like yesterday in hungary . 
  i hope your police is ready too . 
  because they will attack . 
  tl ; dr : austrians authorities bused migrants to graz ( south-east , close to the hungarian border ) , traductors have been specifically ordered not to tell them they won \u00b4 t be taken to germany ( actually taken even further from germany ) , to not have a revolt . 
  this guy seems as young as 9 years ago . 
  vampire ? 
  30 , but only 7 in fighting units , the rest in office .
