  that was the first news , but then the spokeswomen of hungarian police made an official announcement of 14 . 
  it \u00b4 s there , thanks !, 
  it \u00b4 s already there . 
  yes , i agree . 
  there is an eu-serbia deportation agreement , there was no news serbia haven \u00b4 t accepted them . 
  maybe a 1000 , but most walked back when the riot started . 
  there were about 300 rioting . 
  it is a crime in hungary since yesterday . 
  it was a misdemeanor earlier . 
  actually , hungarian police [ used cavalry charges ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4djz8_rqls ) before in crowd control . 
  yes i have seen the new info , i clarified, 
  tell you the truth it went very quickly from `` orban is a xenophobic jackass trying to direct public opinion away from the real problems '' to `` build a wall and stop the flow ! '', 
  200-250 altogether two already got sentenced : they are forbidden to enter hungary for 1 and 2 years . 
  i don \u00b4 t know how it affects their asylum claim in other eu countries . 
  edit : 200-250 yesterday , i haven \u00b4 t seen data on today yet . 
  migrants can \u00b4 t leave the camps ? 
  i was refferring a long term solution as reforming and federalizing the whole topic . 
  police and military from all eu countries in greece and the whole mediterranean , agreements with turkey and other countries in the region to take back the migrants , financing camps , etc. 
  yes , that would lead to a long term solution . 
  based on todays news , it seems they bus everyone to a camp 30 kilometers from the slovenian border . 
  i think they take the serbian option and just channel them through as quickly as possible . 
  serbia started to bus them to the croatian border . 
  these people arrived just after the checkpoint was closed ( the border is open at other places ) , and didn \u00b4 t leave . 
  some extra info : * first : to make it clear , two border crossing roads ( roszke i and ii ) have been closed down for * vehicles * , because migrants sat down on the road . 
  migrants can hand in their asylum request at these two places . 
  there are 2 other border crossing points are working as usual . 
  * this was at roszke ii . 
  official border crossing point * this is a few hundred meters from the main crossing point on the highway , where people yesterday started the hunger strike * this is where migrants came first after the fence was closed at the railtrack * ** at 1 pm migrants gave an ultimatum to the hungarian authorities : `` you let us in or we tear down the gate and go in !, 
  '' ** * later the migrants grew restless , started chanting , throwing stuff and finally attacked the gate around 3 pm . 
  * the police responded with tear gas and water cannons * the counter terrorism center sent reenforcements in armoured cars * a military helicopter arrived * the military is supposedly moving that way , but no firm information on that * according to earlier reports there were only a few hundred migrants ( 1000 tops ) at that border crossing point . 
  hungarian police is used to handle a lot larger aggressive crowds updates : * serbian police is present , haven \u00b4 t intervened yet , watching the show * hungarian mfa contacted the serbian counterpart , no firm answer on whether the serbian police will intervene * the gate is closed again * 250-300 people are actually rioting , the rest moved further away from the border * everyone started to run to the gate , they thought the border is open . 
  no more rioting . 
  * 15-20 tv channels are present , even from brazil * the serbian police walked up to the fence ( without riot gear ) , standing between the fence and the migrants and trying to calm them down . 
  ( a few migrants are trying to convince others to restart the riot ) * [ serbian minister of labor and social affairs , aleksandar vulin , is present on the border and is asking the migrants to get into buses that will take them to the serbian-croatian border . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3l66uq/migrants_on_the_hungarianserbian_border_break/cv3jsff ) a few hundred people started to walk away from the crossing point . 
  * a women started to give birth during the clash . 
  * gate was opened again by migrants , new clash started , serbian police had to hide . 
  * two kids were thrown over the fence ( by parents ? , some grown ups ) close to the gate , they got hurt seriously , they were put in a hungarian ambulance . 
  other kids have been hurt when people ran back from the gate towards serbia . 
  * 14 hungarian policemen hurt , two had to be taken to hospital . 
  rioting migrants used pepper spray too , not just rocks . 
  * only 50 people rioting * serbian police is trying to ask people to get on buses . 
  * the riot died down . 
  * serbian police ( without riot gear ) is between migrants and the gate again . 
  the place is calm . 
  * it seems things calmed down finally . 
  if anything new happens i \u00b4 ll add . 
  * migrants are slowly leaving the place , 2 guys left at the gate . 
  * one rioter who was inciting others to attack the hungarian police was caught . 
  what he did constitutes terrorism according to hungarian law . 
  * serbian police is handing out leaflets with a map showing how to get to the croatian border . 
  * further from the border food and water arrived , migrants started to fight . 
  * a serbian tv crew was hurt by hungarian police at the gate . 
  * serbian mia is sending reenforcements to the hungarian-serbian border to prevent migrants going to the border fence/gates in the future . 
  * everything calm , refugees back to the outskirts of the closest serbian village , no one at the gate . 
  people eating , talking , resting . 
  * more and more refugees are arriving slowly to roszke ii . 
  many still hope they will be able to go through here , and they don \u00b4 t have to take the long way through croatia or romania . 
  * migrants started chanting at gate of roszke i , young man only . 
  then they calmed down . 
  u/raerth mentioned [ a week or two ago ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3k2tsj/why_udclausel_is_still_a_moderator/cuuc2ep ) that the moderation policy will be reviewed and it will be discussed . 
  that time he said by the end of the weekend . 
  nothing happened yet . 
  any update ? 
  i don \u00b4 t speak german , i used the tl ; dr from the hungarian article , but if you give me one , i will change it . 
   europe was the land of neverending warfare of course , but not anymore and we are really happy with our current peace . 
  we really don \u00b4 t want middle eastern conflicts imported ( like turkish and kurdish people in germany recently ) independently of whether that conflict started a week or a millenia ago . 
  in hungary a very few people know about it . 
  i think the public discussion would go down as in bulgaria :d my personal opinion is we are really not there yet to be able to introduce . 
  bi should cover : housing , food , clothing , basic services . 
  except housing , every other item won \u00b4 t grow too much with the growth of average income . 
  meaning if the av . 
  income grows high enough income tax can finance those basic needs for everyone . 
  housing is a question , but it can be solved , just don \u00b4 t go where london went . 
  depends on which part of the city and the time of the day . 
  they bother us too . 
  i am still convinced this was the reason behind that invitation . 
  to compensate for that media blunder . 
  they criticized the general situation and some specific . 
  there were no deaths mentioned except those two . 
  but if you can link somewhere , please , we are interested . 
  there is a very simple solution for serbia : stop the immigrants . 
  best part , that footage is about those who have * entered * hungary last night before the border was closed . 
  my mistake , you are totally right , correcting . 
  any chance romania building a fence on the serbian border around the tri-border area ? 
  depends on how croatia and bih ( or at least the eufor , unprofor forces ) will react . 
  interestingly today i read that there is an internal memo for the german police . 
  it says that non-syrian migrants must be detained at the austria-germany border . 
  a policeman said without name that everyone claims to be syrian and they only hold up those whose skin color is obviously darker than arabs ( africans ) . 
  ( source : index.hu citing a german newspaper . ), 
  that spanish factory will be rolling in the money before the year is over , 
  i understand that the same arguments are used , but the situation is different . 
  i am not debating what has been said before , and what is said now , i am saying we have a completely different situation . 
  tl ; dr : * migrants are taken to the serbia-croatia border instead of the serbia-hungary * there are 20 buses at the presevo bus station , with the labels : sid , croatia, 
  you seriously believe that catholic croatians have the same chance of integrating into austria as people from south asia and africa ? 
  they have the right to leave those camps for a better life , we have the right to refuse entry . 
  i think it is about whether illegal border crossing can be treated as a criminal act or no . 
  hungary says yes , as they are coming from a safe country . 
  others , as the bbc says no , as they are refugees . 
  quotas won \u00b4 t solve anything .
