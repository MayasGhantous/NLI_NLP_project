  migrants don \u00b4 t stay in hungary or greece , they move on . 
  what we need is a strong external border protection , and deportation agreements with countries like turkey . 
  3 appealed already . 
  ( out of the 16 rejections ), 
  hungary and germany sent policemen to serbia to help them out in stopping th migrant flow . 
  serbia still preferred letting them through . 
   viktor orban likes none of those things , and has worked diligently to limit them in hungary , being particularly successful with limiting press freedom [ yea , the media is totally controlled in hungary ] ( http://magyarnarancs.hu/archivum_reszletes/2015/37 ) ( caption : a country ashamed ), 
  * choose ideology over reality and what your voters want . 
  * cry about radical parties gaining ground * ??? 
  actually what hungary wants in the long run is help for greece , stopping migrants there ( 80-90 % of illegal immigrants enter the eu there , including those who later show up at the hungarian border ) by an eu wide effort , including sending policemen , which hungary is ready to do , and sending ships . 
  greece has been pretty much left on its own for more than a decade with this problem and illegal migration will only grow in the following decades . 
  i think they will still prefer illegal working in the uk over hungarian welfare , it will be still a better income taking into consideration even the difference in price levels . 
  or alternatively : orban has found a topic that is a concern for most europeans and says what is on the mind of europeans . 
  luckily he doesn \u00b4 t give a fuck anymore what others think ( unlike in 1998-2002 ) , so he just says it . 
  only a few dozen as the most will be allowed to start the asylum process a day . 
  the rest gets immediate rejection at the border and turned back to serbia . 
  the migrant hands in an asylum request at the border . 
  in the first step it is reviewed right there . 
  there is a shortlist for reasons of immediate rejections , coming from a safe country is on it , it is immediately rejected and they are told to go back to serbia . 
  ( here is a little legal grey area , as they are on hungarian territory , but they have not entered the country legally yet . ), 
  * if * their assylum application is accepted . 
  people without passports or with passports from safe countries can not start the process . 
  only a few hundred application a day are even considered for acceptance . 
  most migrants won \u00b4 t even enter the country in the legal sense . 
  liberal democracy doesn \u00b4 t mean we have to be liberals or leftist , the liberal and leftist parties made this mistake , they believed this idea and lost . 
  exactly what the hungarian government says : send more help to turkey , lebanon , jordan and keep them there . 
  someone commented already the official figures from hungary , a third are from syria . 
  tl ; dr : * we could be joking how austria is doing the exact same thing for what they criticized hungary * democracy is the reason why other countries changed their mind . 
  you can \u00b4 t go against public opinion for a long time and without arguments . 
  * in those countries where large number of muslims live parallel societies develop . 
  they have a large pool to draw from . 
  our ( western ) way of life can get into minority , so we are protecting our way of life . 
  * there will be no refugee camps in hungary , they should be built in greece . 
  * it is likely that a national emergency will be declared . 
  the new fence and harsher rules serve the purpose of forcing migrants to respect the laws and regulations . 
  * most migrants are not refugees but economic migrants , who want a higher level of economic well being . 
  refugees deserve help , but europeans worked hard for their economic well being , and we can not be asked to share it with others , others whose life is not in danger anymore . 
  * it would be nice to hear from migrants more the words `` please '' and `` thank you '' and less `` i deserve '' and `` i demand '' * then he talked about the army , and the former md , but nothing new . 
  [ and he thinks this too ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3kzmii/viktor_orban_hungarian_pm_the_european_way_of/ ), 
  well , they are supposed to be registered , so their fingerprints are in the system . 
  you are right , i was thinking about dublin , which states that they have to be registered in the first country , and without that registration they are not supposed to leave the country . 
  edit ; obviously serbia can stop them from entering . 
  you mean when they are caught on the see ? 
  freedom of movement * inside * the country . 
  serbia closing it \u00b4 s border for immigrants , that \u00b4 s exactly what hungary wants . 
  hopefully they will stick to the highway . 
  you have to remember 2 days ago hungarian authorities counted 5 thousand migrants entering the country . 
  the un said there was was about 5000 more , who haven \u00b4 t got in touch with the authorities , they had to wander around the countryside . 
  it is a decade old agreement with ukraine . 
  we have sent to the macedonian border ( together with the germans . 
  bulgarian policemen has been seen on the hungarian-serbian border ), 
  you \u00b4 re right !, 
  i read somewhere that there is political will to introduce them . 
  did it pick up at all ? 
  how do you open up a new bank account without a drivers license ? 
  it is interesting for someone who needs id even to use a bank card to pay for a larger bag of groceries . 
  redistribution won \u00b4 t work ( they will just go back to germany , and then schengen will be in long term trouble ) , and it wouldn \u00b4 t solve the most important problem : a major influx of immigrants , that will only worsen in the following decades . 
  and that is what v4 countries don \u00b4 t want . 
  i never thought i will quote orban in a positive light , but `` we don \u00b4 t want parallel societies in our country '' is something i agree with . 
  we don \u00b4 t want a st. denis in budapest . 
  the budget will have to be revised . 
  policeman and soldiers are there already , it \u00b4 s not like they have been hired now . 
  they just have to pull 12 hours on - 12 hours off workdays . 
  of course they won \u00b4 t stay there . 
  this policy is about : * domestic votes : stop the growth of the far right ( they are in second place in the polls , maybe even if the leftist and liberal parties would ally ) by having a hard line stance on the issue . 
  we \u00b4 ll see in the september polls if it worked . 
  in the august polls still not , but things really sped up in the last two weeks . 
  * force the eu to take action and reform the whole immigration system . 
  which seems to work , the council today decided that the comission should develop frontex into a proper border and coast guard agency and the whole immigration policy should be overhauled . 
  once the migrants go your way , i guess there will be much more people hurt . 
  germany and sweden apparently ... 
  or put up some spectrum towers, 
  new laws and regulations [ go into effect ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3kwypr/refugees_turned_away_as_hungarianserbian_border/cv1a3th ), 
  6000 euros . 
  i don \u00b4 t know where you get that figure of costs , but the median annual income in turkey is 6500 euros . 
  6000 to feed and shelter someone seems pretty good . 
  coming from a safe country . 
  asking if they have given asylum . 
  if they have a rejection letter , they can be let in . 
  you don \u00b4 t have ids or you just don \u00b4 t have to carry them ? 
  the same reason ukraine agreed : money and equipment . 
  i just read that the councils meeting ended , they agreed that the eu should offer 6000 euros for each refugee to the country accepting them . 
  why not include turkey in the deal ? 
  next step making an agreement with turkey that they take back people caught in the border zone , ( in this case on the sea ) . 
  ( there is one with ukraine , maybe others too ), 
   15 000 police and military for a 100 mile fence  20,000 agents for 2,000 miles . 
  that is a substantial difference . 
  and as u/thetwocents pointed out , it is expected that they will go another way . 
  exactly and something will change finally , sending navies to sink smuggler boats ( after taking everyone off of them ) is a great first step . 
  edit : the council wants frontex to be transformed into an actual border police and coast guard service . 
  here we have about 15 000 police and military for a 100 mile fence . 
  i don \u00b4 t think the us has anywhere these numbers per 100 mile in az or nm for example . 
  in the states you just have to get through the fence and that is it . 
  in europe you can be stopped anytime for an id check , without any reason . 
  you have to carry an id , if you don \u00b4 t the police can hold you up until your identity is found out . 
  central europe is much more densely populated than most of the us-mexico border . 
  yes they are ready to use non lethal weapons . 
  ( watercannon , rubber bullets , tear gas , batons ) they are allowed to use firearms in self protection or protection of others already , there is nothing new . 
  all true , except :  welcome to hungary , please wait in your assigned camp until the official decision is made on your asylum application in the next 1-500 days . 
  next 2-3 hours on average , not more than 14 days .
