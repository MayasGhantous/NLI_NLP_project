  of course it is dangerous , but the situation is already dangerous , there were clashes already yesterday and today . 
  the only luck is that the police still behaves . 
  the new cold war might heat up ? 
  those bombs can easily fall on russian soldiers , not talking about western and russian planes in direct confrontation . 
  we will see how they handle it . 
  in the last years the police used water cannons , rubber bullets , tear gas , horse charges , batons against people . 
  they learned their lesson . 
  chemical weapons , come on , those who are coming ran from the war and not fighting it . 
  no one will mow them down . 
  non lethal weapons will be used , like tear gas . 
  in hungary people are generally much more relaxed , and politics plays a lot less importance in discussions . 
  i never seen people discussing anything even remotely connected to politics in any workplace . 
  it is frowned upon strongly . 
  that said there are always people who are a bit overly fixated on politics , they are your average redditor on r/europe type of people . 
  now , at the same time when there is something big , people talk about it , and can get radicalized quickly , kind of what happens now . 
  ( this can also lead people jumping over to the other side in the left/right divide . ), 
  people can go in a few days from `` this jackass orban with his stupid fence and xenophobic billboards , we could spend the money a lot better '' to `` build a fucking 10 meter high wall now with machine guns preferably ! '', 
  an interesting thing is the many differences between the right and left in hungary and the west . 
  left ( liberals by definition belong here , historical reasons ) : pro free market , pro privatization of public services ( e.g. 
  : health care ) , the state is wrong and should be minimized , unions are ok until they do what we want , pro israel , pro migration , minorities can do no bad , minimum wage is wrong , blindly pro-eu and nato , we should be friendly with russia right : strong state , defense of public services , taking back privatized enterprises , pro palestine , although now against immigration of muslims in general , strongly help unions and workers rights , minorities can do bad , minimum wage have been raised substantially only under rightist governments , pro eu and nato from total acceptance , to criticism ( the government ) , to `` the eu should be a europe of nations , not of eurocrats '' ( jobbik , far right ) , fuck russia , although it changes lately , especially the far right became fond of putin, 
  israel built a wall and seems to work . 
  somewhere i read hungary consulted with israel . 
  maybe bulgaria and greece should too . 
  actually , not even deportation , as legally they will not enter the country . 
  * you see that forest over there ? 
  that \u00b4 s serbia , have a nice walk !, 
  both greece and bulgaria have set up fences on the turkish border already . 
  why would i downvote you ? 
   a couple of weeks ago 71 refugees were found dead in a truck in austria . 
  it is now known that all 71 got into that truck at keleti railway station in budapest as they could not stand the humiliation and inhuman conditions they were forced to endure there . 
  the station was closed down the day after those 71 dead people have been found . 
  but jobbik neither , so win-win . 
  some said it is a bluff , but seems this is for real . 
  expect a lot more : `` brutality in hungary '' headlines . 
  and once the police will lose temper , like on friday after the hungary-romania game , they can be dangerous . 
  edit : [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4ykiqszbpc ) and [ another ] ( https://youtu.be/-uy3950gfee?t=4m43s ) about what happens when the police loses temper in hungary, 
  the pm gave him a hard time during a government meeting on front of everyone because they are behind schedule with the fence . 
  ( the current is just a temporary , the real thing , so called nato fence , is still being built . ), 
  the defense minister could not accept the tone and treatment and offered his resignation . 
  it is not in the article , i read it somewhere else : in the heat of the moment the pm accepted the resignation . 
  the new dm is one of the founders of fidesz , the government party , but lately did not have any important post . 
  tl ; dr : the pm yelled at the dm , the dm offered his resignation , it was accepted immediately . 
  it \u00b4 s not clear , the police wasn \u00b4 t communicative with the journalists . 
  i guess they close down the border from time to time depending on the situation in syria . 
  yea , i thought the same . 
  english : https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2findex.hu%2fbelfold%2f2015%2f09%2f09%2forban_lecserelte_a_minisztert_megkezdodott_a_katonai_mozgositas%2f&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url tl ; dr : mobilization has begun , the new law on immigration allows the government to use the military in a migratory crisis . 
  employees in the military hospital in budapest are listed up , so they can be sent down to the border too . 
  i forgot , there was an interesting gossip among the refugees : they think the us is sending ships for them . 
  interestingly this is the most liberal news site in hungary . 
  they visited refugees in turkey . 
  there are people who wants to go back to fight , there are rich people who are living off of savings and are waiting to be able to go back . 
  a lot of people started businesses in turkey . 
  a lot of people don \u00b4 t have the money to leave . 
  there was one family they interviewed , which after visiting relatives in turkey haven \u00b4 t been allowed to go back to syria . 
  turkish border police told them no , they were waiting to be able to bribe someone . 
  the father has a shop in syria , a son had a job . 
  in english : https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2findex.hu%2fkulfold%2f2015%2f09%2f09%2fezert_nem_jonnek_europaba_a_szir_menekultek%2f&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url, 
   no , i do n't . 
  keep enjoying cognitive dissonance . 
  and you wonder why people go over to r/european . 
  `` its just nazis we are better off without . '', 
  just because you don \u00b4 t like it , reality wont go away . 
  sun wouldn \u00b4 t call it exclusive a day ago if it wasn \u00b4 t. 
  yes you are right the general topic of terrorists using immigrant routes to get into europe was covered . 
  the fact that one specific terrorist was helped by french volunteers was not . 
  i reviewed the new queue , this news piece is not there . 
  please reinstate it . 
  in hungary handball and water polo are neck to neck for the second place . 
  in most democratic state heads of the secret services and other top organizations are changed almost always when a new administration comes in . 
  this is the rule , not an exception . 
  hoover was the last one in the us who successfully survived several administrations and was able only to do so by blackmailing presidents . 
  these positions are as much about trust as about professionalism . 
  you can not lead a country if you can not be sure that leading bureaucrat won \u00b4 t try to fuck up your plans or projects . 
  yes there is discrimination based on race but it is the nth thing down the line . 
  and it just can not be compared to the us in any way . 
  it \u00b4 s like finding a bucket of water in the desert and then claiming the place is a marshland . 
  allright , central-europe here , i can talk about this part of europe . 
  i think it would be useful for both you and us if you would rank the three answers from most to least . 
  what do you think , what impacts more your day to day life ? 
  ( e.g. 
  : which would lead to a physical attack against you or your property ) : * your skin color * the fact that you speak the language of the country where you live with an obvious foreign accent or not * your car has a number plate from a not liked country ( serb in croatia for example ), 
  it is not a belief , it is reality . 
  u/arathian already covered culture and religion , i \u00b4 ll just add ethnicity . 
  hate , physical violence even war for example in the balkans or northern ireland was ethnic based ( with religion as an easy identifier ) . 
  white people killed white people . 
  you can not tell me you see skin color difference between irish and english or serbs and croats . 
  even today , when you see hate against immigrants , it is not a white-black thing . 
  in the uk those who speak badly about blacks , speak as badly about the polish . 
  the question is not which groups they shouldn \u00b4 t let in , it is about not letting in anyone . 
  looking at the current situation from a racial standpoint is just totally misguided , and you will never be able to understand todays problems . 
  making comments based on a racial divide doesn \u00b4 t add anything to the debate , it just pisses off europeans and strengthens the belief that americans don \u00b4 t know anything about the rest of the world . 
  that is very good , even not understanding anything !, 
  ( good morning zagreb ? ), 
  no idea , any song in special ? 
  i really liked the heroes today video , what is the lyrics about ? 
  we gave [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--vaz9jw054 ) to the world . 
  how more embarrassing can it go ? 
  edit : [ hitz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jh-xckazsk ) is a great song !,
