holy crap was it a mixed bag of people . 
  old commie pensioners , right wing nutters , college kids , families with children and plenty of [ foreigners ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7id5pti.jpg ) as well . 
  judging from the number of people openly smoking on the streets of madrid , i would say it 's pretty relaxed . 
  i was in a queue at f\u0151zdefeszt for 40 minutes waiting for a burger , then gave up and went to montenegro gourman on blaha lujza t\u00e9r , had a huge pljeskavica with tons of ajvar . 
  best decision ever . 
  hungarian , english , german and spanish . 
  i just started to learn welsh . 
  and sheep . 
  is she really hated ? 
  as far as i know all that bathing in blood and killing servants is a myth , and only appeared in the 18th century , long after her death . 
  i 'm not saying she was a saint but she was n't any worse than other nobleman of her time . 
  is croatian man the european florida man ? 
  it 's due to the telephoto distortion effect : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perspective_distortion_%28photography%29, 
  give us some slack , at least we did n't [ steal your chocolate ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt9nbtw4sba ) :d, 
  i thought we would score a bit higher . 
  he did travel , apparently his favorite destination was budapest and valetta a close second, 
  probably made of spanish paprika, 
  ok so let me translate those back to english and add the original title : * hogyan rohanj a vesztedbe - how to run to your fate - a million ways to die in the west ( ted is capitalized to emphasize it 's a macfarlane film ) * m\u00e1snaposok szerencs\u00e9je - the luck of hangover - walk of shame ( tries to build on the audience of the hangover franchise ) * m\u00e1r megint lak\u00f3t\u00e1rsat keres\u00fcnk - rommate needed , again - chinese puzzle ( the whole trilogy was titled the same way looking for roommate , still looking for roommate ... ), 
  every . 
  thing . 
  even movie titles are localized so sometimes you do n't even know what film you 're watching . 
  a good comrade knows it 's duty even beyond the grave, 
  so what 's up with changing the music ? 
  do they put manele on ? 
  on the serious note , i live in britain and know that it 's not always easy to be an eastern european here . 
  but i do n't think romanians are singled out . 
  i have colleagues from romania who were here even before the the job market was opened up without any problem . 
  if someone has all the paperwork and the assistant in the bank refuses to open a current account , you call the manager or take your business to another bank . 
  this is how it works and we 've all been there , even locals . 
  the more worrying events are the current [ attacks on polish families ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/may/05/poland-envoy-concerned-attacks-belfast ) . 
  when i see kids acting ` gangsta ' , i have a sudden urge to force them to watch gomorra . 
  it 's paprika mixed with salt in a shot glass , as i could n't find any other small container, 
  next year i 'm attempting to bake one, 
  central hungary is on par with northern ireland . 
  that 's depressing . 
  brighton beach is called little odessa so ... 
  too soon . 
  for reasons beyond art , my absolute favourite is the r\u00e1k\u00f3czi portrait [ here 's why ] ( http://i.imgur.com/izszgaz.jpg ), 
   in the end they will all do equally good ( or bad ) as germany pretty much sums up our last 100 years . 
  yeah , i thought that 's where all the elderly spend their winter fuel allowance . 
  according to [ t\u00c1rki 's research ] ( http://www.tarki.hu/hu/research/elect/index.html ) jobbik is at 9 % , magyar hajnal is among the 1 % other , but that said 40 % is undecided . 
  according to voks 14 an interactive polling app jobbik is at 18 % , magyar hajnal is not measured . 
  this is what 's happening now in hungary . 
  hungarian medics have to sign a contract that they will practice medicine in hungary for 10 years after graduation . 
  if they do n't they have to pay back the costs of their education . 
  but at the same time more and more foreign doctors work in the hungarian healthcare too , romanians , indians , algerians . 
  thanks a lot !, 
  g\u00f6teborg porterfestival sounds amazing, 
  it looks fun from the photos , well maybe 2015 then, 
  i found the hromadske.tv video very powerful . 
  all those people standing in a group quite , like an army waiting for orders . 
  wot ? 
  i really like the effort from the italians . 
  estonia , belgium and the vatican are just lazy . 
  you must be fun at parties, 
  my friend is married to a ukrainian girl and they have a child on the way . 
  he is quite sure the kid will be properly confused , because in hungary on 6th december we have the mikul\u00e1s ( santa ) coming to bring some sweets to the nice children , then at christmas the baby jesus brings the gifts and in their case grandfather snow will come in january to bring gifts . 
  what 's wales in portuguese ? 
  while the view is superb , when i drove there , i found it quite nerve wrecking to be honest . 
  in every corner there were people parking their cars , blasting manele from the car stereo , frying mici and drinking cujka . 
  ususally wandering on the road , transforming the road to an uphill obstacle course . 
  yep , that 's the one, 
  the most important thing i know is that if someone offers h\u00e1karl to me again , i will politely decline . 
  i 'm happy i could help :d you might also enjoy the new craft beer pubs like [ l\u00e9h\u0171t\u0151 ] ( http://welovebudapest.com/en/cafes-bars/lehuto-craft-beer-bar ) and [ \u00c9leszt\u0151 ] ( http://welovebudapest.com/en/cafes-bars/eleszto ) . 
  it 's a quite new brew by legenda brewery , wgich is also quite young , but your best bet would be [ csak a j\u00f3 s\u00f6r ] ( http://welovebudapest.com/en/cafes-bars/csakajosor ) in budapest , it 's a bar/shop , with plenty of excellent hungarian beer , 
  soproni d\u00e9mon is indeed a great beer , but i think currently the best hungarian beer is t\u00e1voli galaxis . 
  i have to agree with him . 
  since living is wales i realised that even simple things like cwtch ca n't be translated to english and grammar is almost as twisted as the hungarian , 
  i had the pleasure to fly from stockholm to budapest with a group of swedish teens , and about 40 minutes into the journey every alcoholic beverage was consumed . 
  i have never seen anything like that , it was spectacular . 
  i will never forget the joy on those faces when they heard booze was free  but they were actually pretty civilised , so they would n't make it to my personal annoying tourist list either . 
  you people are good at this . 
  mincemeat is not even meat !, 
  the pie is a lie !, 
  it 's working . 
  if you dunk the digestive biscuit in your tea for too long , you 're gon na have a bad time . 
  yeah pudding is a weired one . 
  black pudding , yorkshire pudding , christmas pudding ... they have nothing in common !, 
  my grandparents managed it . 
  you would call them germans , as they were danube swabians , living in hungary . 
  but they always identified themselves as hungarians . 
  they spoke the language , grandpa was in the hungarian army , grandma made very nice embroideries and they were respected members of the local community . 
  and nobody questioned whether or not they were hungarians , ever . 
  i think you 're missing the point . 
  identity is self assigned . 
  if i feel like i 'm hungarian i will identify myself as one . 
  that 's it . 
  yeah , i 'm not a linguist . 
  but funny enough for the brick people use both words where i grew up, 
  he played the piano too loud and pissed off the neighbours . 
  and well pushed a very expensive project through the us military , without actually any concrete evidence it would work , then later ratted out his former boss . 
  and * that 's * why we do n't like to speak about this, 
  have you heard about the [ american rom ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt9nbtw4sba ) campaign ? 
  yeah , it did not come from hungary per se , but hungarian contribution was instrumental to this project . 
  next to leo szil\u00e1rd there was also [ ede teller ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ede_teller ) working on the manhattan project , who is known mostly as the `` father of the h-bomb '' . 
  and a few others : [ j\u00e1nos kem\u00e9ny ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_g._kemeny ) , [ j\u00e1nos neumann ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_von_neumann ) , [ jen\u0151 wigner ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eugene_wigner ) . 
  can confirm , `` v\u00f6r\u00f6s '' is the more emotional version and `` piros '' is more descriptive . 
  how come all romanians i know and strangers on the internet like yourself see the situation of sz\u00e9kelyf\u00f6ld totally reasonable , but still politicians talk nonsense ? 
  there 's a hungarian phrase `` s\u00edrva v\u00edgad a magyar '' which means hungarians cry while having fun . 
  and this is so true .
