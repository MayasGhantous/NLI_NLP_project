  towards foreigners hungarians are friendly and happy . 
  but put 5 hungarians in a room and soon it will get depressing . 
  we recite all the horrible things happened to us , drink obscene amounts of p\u00e1linka and sing sad songs all night . 
  so celebrating losses kinda makes sense . 
  it happened to the most of us i think . 
  i once woke up in someone 's house after a house party , with a very bad hangover . 
  crawled to the fridge and became really excited to see a bottle of cold mineral water , took a big swig . 
  it was n't water . 
  as most of the countries joined the eu where 's a significant hungarian population , it brought these communities closer to the motherland so most of the sensible people is n't really concerned anymore , but you can find other opinions easily . 
  hungary actually was a kingdom until 1946 , but till 1918 hungarian royal family was the habsburgs whom also happened to reign in austria . 
  then after wwi there was two years of communist mayhem , charles iv ( or charles i as austrians know him ) was exiled to madeira . 
  1920 mkl\u00f3s horthy a former navy admiral formed an army of royalist soldiers , took the country back and restored the kingdom and appointed himself as the regent . 
  so hungary was a kingdom without a king till 1946 . 
  probably the most hungarian thing is storing home made p\u00e1linka in plastic water bottles to fool people with untrained eyes , 
  came here to say that . 
  even our national team could beat them , which says something . 
   not to be confused with croatia . 
  i do n't even know where to start , i grew up near the border , been there countless times , have a few friends who moved to hungary during the war , here 's a few things the others might not mention : * croats love sports !, 
  i mean really . 
  * biggest football rivalry : hajduk split - dinamo zagreb , i saw a few bbb and torcida usernames here that indicates to me we have some ultras among us  * extremely detailed murals painted everywhere * big diaspora in australia * thompson is a bit controversial nationalist rock band , but \u010cavoglave is a great song that gives me the goosebumps every time i hear it . 
  or cheese , spinach , etc. 
  it 's the best thing that ever happened to the balkan, 
  now i can finally import tonnes of burek !, 
  i totally understand that it would piss off some people , i just used that , because that 's how my geography teacher referred to the area . 
  but what would you use then ? 
  islands of the north atlantic sounds too politically correct , plus in my mind the name includes the faeroe islands and iceland . 
  west european isles sounds good . 
  could i use that ? 
  irish travellers . 
  they confused me for a while . 
  where i come from ** gipsy ** refers to the romani people , but apparently on the british isles it means travellers . 
  i still know very little about them . 
  that surprised me too . 
  but is it possible that the folks at microsoft do n't know it 's a country so they left it off the list ? 
  oh man , i ate your rotten shark meat once . 
  just once . 
  ... and hungary . 
  it exists anyway . 
  here 's [ techno manele ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2kdlhl_vy8 ) for you, 
  by default yes . 
  but cities or counties can add local sales tax . 
  i remember clearly that near los angeles tax was 10 % and in monterey i paid 8 %, 
  your no. 7 is slowly crawling into europe . 
  i see takeaway coffee everywhere these days and just ca n't understand why do n't people get up 10 minutes earlier and sit down to enjoy their morning brew . 
  when i 've been in the us , my biggest problem was n't the endless shelves , but the fact that they do n't include tax in the price displayed , so you have to guess what will be your total . 
  and tax changes by county . 
  i 'm willing to take that risk . 
  with your reasoning , yes . 
  it would mean that by discontinuing the 500 $ note , the volume of cash would increase 5 fold . 
  that means if you kept all your illegal earnings in cash , you need 5 times the storage facilities , new bank accounts , more guards , more trips to get the same amount through a border , etc. 
  i ca n't wait to test the cuteness of this !, 
  i see , now all i want to know is if dingili-dong is a valid way to greet a swedish person :d, 
  please [ explain !,

  alcohol is pretty expensive , and because of this there 's a whole booze cruise industry on the baltic sea , where drinks are cheap to lure in frugal swedish functioning alcoholics . 
  mate , i think you mixed up our flags . 
  look , this is a crap article . 
  it just picks out one sentence from the context . 
  it could 've been a friendly banter for all we know . 
  and anyway he represents the brits , and as an eastern european , i got way worse comments from brits , so he is a fairly good representation of his people . 
  i like him . 
  political correctness is overrated . 
  you laugh , but here 's a story : do extra-terrestrial beings exist ? 
  - the nobel prize winning italian physicist , enrico fermi , was once asked by his disciples in california . 
  of course , fermi answered - they are already here among us , they are called hungarians ... 
  ~ ~ how did you find those ? 
  when i try to use text search in the archive it never brings up any results ~ ~ edit : never mind i was just being dopey . 
  i did n't set the time period right . 
  now i can find all the things !, 
  i think this is a great album but i think it 's missing the two most badass things the finnish had in ww2 : the [ molotov cocktail ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zolt%c3%a1n_t%c3%a9gl%c3%a1s ) and [ simo h\u00e4y\u00e4 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/simo_h%c3%a4yh%c3%a4 ), 
  well , you 're right it 's partly because of benefits for fidesz at the next elections . 
  but it 's also a gesture to show that the motherland did n't forget the hungarian diaspora . 
  also there are plenty of hungarians living in countries that are not eu members , like serbia , ukraine and overseas in australia and usa . 
  like i do n't mind that people like [ zoli t\u00e9gl\u00e1s ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zolt%c3%a1n_t%c3%a9gl%c3%a1s ) who was born in the us , lived there all his life gets the citizenship . 
  and i think if someone 's willing to learn our very complicated language and has some connection to our country , i 'm happy to call them compatriots , 
  sounds like some anti-eu , far right propaganda . 
  eu membership actually brought the motherland a lot closer to hungarians living in neighbouring countries . 
  so i would say that added gherkins to the schnitzel , 
  i have bad news . 
  i think it was just a mistake , everybody knows [ hungary is a schnitzel ] ( http://i.imgur.com/telnklc.jpg ), 
  in hungary this is making rounds in the social media today more due to the comical quality , but still it 's a conspiracy theory . 
  http://i.imgur.com/1742ptc.jpg `` see how this weather is the due to the activity of the jewish airconditioner manufacturer maffia !!!!, 
  they 've been able to control the weather for a very long time , open your eyes !!!!!!! '', 
  the original is of course full of grammatical errors , just what you would expect from a nutter . 
  magaluf = / = spain, 
  looks like action bronson, 
  egyes\u00fclt kir\u00e1lys\u00e1g but once i addressed a letter to my mates in cardiff with `` egyes\u00fclt kir\u00e1lys\u00e1g '' and i confused the lady at the post office a lot . 
  it went something like this : - what country is this letter going to ? 
  - it 's great britain basically - you mean england ? 
  - if you want to be specific it 's wales - sorry , wales is not in the postal tarriff calculator, 
  also in hungary, 
  maybe there 's just not enough crime ? 
  like in [ kopps ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajfdepdqkry ), 
  hence the use of the word similar, 
  in hungary the similar package ( 1000down/200up ) is 13 $ from digi just saying http://digi.hu/ajanlat/internet/lan, 
  i thought maybe the author but clearly not, 
  i do n't trust an infographic that does n't even get the hungarian flag right, 
  it 's also a band i 'm quite fond of, 
  what does a hungarian does a hungarian do if they need reinforcement ? 
  they * `` kolb\u00e1sz '' *,
