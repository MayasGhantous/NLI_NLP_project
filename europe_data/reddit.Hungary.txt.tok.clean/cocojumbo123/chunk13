   we should just pay the fee i do n't mind the money - i mind the political concessions ( visa and accelerated accession talks ) . 
  providing a future is not a human right - what are you talking about ? 
  you are right - should have been adheration or even more correctly accession criteria, 
  in many eu countries this has to be approved by referendum - doubt it 'll pass in the near future . 
  it 's called `` let 's do an omelette while breaking someone else eggs '' , 
  hehe , fair enough - good point . 
  over direct relocation from turkey to europe . 
  but then you risk a high level court deciding it 's not ( like for greece ) so will be back to square 1 . 
  or am i missing something ? 
  would n't that mean germany should declare turkey safe 3 ` rd party country ? 
   it would mean that the main route ( through turkey ) is closed the famous eurojoust report doubts turkey can do this :( http://www.politico.eu/article/eurojust-report-raises-doubts-about-eu-turkey-migration-deal-refugee-crisis-asylym-syria-war/, 
  i know - the independent media disagrees with public media  the public media changed the story from `` orban saves europe by veto '' to `` leaders did n't reach and agreement '' . 
  edit : source in hungarian : http://comment.blog.hu/2016/03/07/igy_menti_meg_orban_viktor_europat_a_kozmedia_szerint, 
  also italy over freedom of press . 
  also hungarian media said the negotiations were not in a point that anyone could veto anything yet . 
  according to [ hungarian press ] ( http://index.hu/kulfold/orban_viktor_menekultugyi_vetoja_nyoman_felbeszakadt_az_eu-csucs/ ) he was not the only one . 
   `` orban is only one of the leaders with strong concerns . 
  for example greece also opposed opening of new aderation chapters . 
  we are not in a position to decide on anything , most diplomats need to approve at home the new proposal ''  according to our sources the prime ministers of hungary , italy and greece were the most opposing . 
  edit : from what i read it looks that the new turkish proposal took eu by surprise . 
  more time to prepare an answer is needed . 
  just saw on politico :  `` the reuters leak [ see below ] is the turkish proposal . 
  leaders said it 's a credible one but some said they needed to speak to their parliament , amid concerns the price is too high . 
  it means that it 's likely we will not have a deal tonight and also that the dinner at 7 p.m. is in danger since it was meant to be the dinner where europeans get back to the turks with an answer to their requests . '', 
   you 're done with all non-syrian refugees and with the incoming constant stream . 
  this assumes turkey will manage somehow to do what germany can not - deport non-refugees to their countries of origin . 
  call me unconvinced . 
   that we should just start with distribution but it was blocked orban declared on friday morning ( on hungarian radio ) that he 'll reject any quotas . 
  but let 's see if there will be another majority . 
   so why do you assume that greece is any different . 
  because , unfortunately , greece is in a less fortunate position due to their geography . 
  what has golden dawn do with it ? 
  in hungary jobbik is # 2 unfortunately . 
  look , i am not saying it 's not a bitter pill for greece - i am saying we shall try to sweeten it as much as possible . 
   reuters quotes a source saying that davuto\u011flu told merkel and dutch pm mark rutte last night that it wants another $ 20 billion to support syrian refugees in turkey . 
   in exchange it promised :  -- to take back all non-syrian migrants denied asylum in europe ( plus those intercepted in its territorial waters ) , and  -- to crack down harder on people smugglers . 
  ~ ~ of for fuck 's sake just give the 20b to greece and they 'll build 5 star camps . ~ ~ edit : apparently they were asking for 3b extra only, 
  genuinely asking and genuine confusion - but you reply wrt our main source of confusion ; if germany is so concerned ...  force them to the facilities in greece and fly them in by plane . 
  it 's not ( so ) unfair for greece if the whole eu helps them . 
  let 's say , if instead of giving 3 + billion to turkey let 's give that to greece . 
  german position is confusing - at least here in orbanistan . 
  on one hand they say that we have to reduce the numbers , on another they are criticizing the only measures which proved * ( so far ) to be working . 
  i mean it 'll be much easier for macedonia to just let everyone through and good luck with that . 
  all of this while by their own admission , many migrants say they come in europe to go to germany . 
  * nb : i am not saying this is the only possible solution . 
  that part was a joke ... 
  you think greece will risk a skirmish in the economical situation they are ? 
  also assuming they manage to open the border to macedonia , what will do next : invade serbia ? 
   but you can still say `` ok , 200 is still a lot better than 2000 '' yes , i do  and if the situation gets worse i bet orban will create red-white-green ( aka hungarian ) crocodiles and put them at the border . 
  joke aside , let 's look at the scenarios : - turkey - greece is the only dangerous place , once done it 's free ride till germany - turkey - greece is the only dangerous place , but i am stuck in greece with little hope to move on do you think the numbers crossing will be the same ? 
   greece wo n't just use brute force ? 
  this will be interesting . 
  orbanator just reiterated on fri he will accept no quotas . 
  hungary was in the same position as greece months ago - even more people transited us - e.g. 
  albanians and kosovars did n't go through greece . 
  i remember norway is accepting around 1 % of people coming from russia - so that 'll not be a mass option . 
  more probably via montenegro - albania - italy - germany but i doubt we 'll see 10k people/day . 
  v4 will have a collective orgasm - after only 6 months eu/ec acknowledges as a top priority securing the borders ... what orban ( i still dislike him ) & co said all along ... 
   did you see the threads after the uk got its ` reform 's ? 
  what thread ? 
  still love you mate , btw :p, 
   na this place is anti-uk . 
  na , this place is mainly wishing uk stays in eu . 
  imo that means this is pro uk . 
   because what 's the reason for posting it ? 
  dunno - as i said , i do n't see why it has any relevancy with the brexit . 
  i mean , assuming uk was the weaker country on the planet and never had any colonies , why would the past matter ? 
  but i do n't think that means / r/europe is anti-uk . 
  if anything most people here ( myself included ) would like you guys to stay - but ** not at any cost ** . 
  and yes , i do believe that a brexit will be economically more painful for uk than eu . 
  i do n't have a clue of who liam fox is or why he is important . 
  i know liam neeson - but i think they are not relatives , 
  no , but he said `` we hate everyone '' - i thought especially as neighbors we 're included , 
  shit like this is the main reason why i am fanatically pro free-speech . 
  even if that speech is insulting/offending me . 
  it is my choice to be offended or not , to read the offending thing or not . 
  i know , many people in established democracies think - it 's ok to ban hate speech about xyz , the slippery slope will never happen here . 
  i do n't know . 
  but we can see that banning hate speech might lead to banning offensive speech which might lead to banning any opposing speach . 
  nb : i hate hate speech as well !, 
  except for when it happens - we know of internet filters `` for the kids '' which `` by accident '' filter something else , etc. 
  and do n't even get me started about situation in `` new '' democracies ( e.g. 
  hungary ) . 
  edit : and it 's why i 'm so critical of our mods every now and then . 
  edit 2 : i was born in a country where a joke against the government could land you in jail ... 
  and people tell me this sub is n't anti-uk . 
  err , why do you say that ? 
  is there anything incorrect in the post ? 
  however , i do n't see why this has any connection with the brexit referendum for that i do n't believe kids should be guilty of the sins of their grandparents . 
  personally , i really hope jews keep on staying in europe !, 
  and i consider it extremely sad that/if they want to leave . 
  for example , in hungary we have a [ huge list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_hungarian_jews ) of jews which contributed enormously to arts , sciences , sports , whatever . 
  i 'm catholic btw - before anyone suspects me of being a shill . 
  why u hate us ? 
  :( we likez of you !, 
  especially in the summer . 
   are we supposed to revile stalin and burn down all images of him ? 
  yes . 
  the migrant saga hit apex on sept 5 - on sept 1 there were 34 degrees during the day . 
  so yeah , that 's exactly winter .
