  we do n't need to - the convention does n't mean `` free pass to germany '' . 
  first at all i am really sorry for what happened to you - and no , you are not a racist . 
  also it 's none of your fault so do n't even think on blaming yourself on anything . 
  second , i suggest you seek counseling in the near future - depending on the person situations like this can mess your brain for many years to come . 
  better be safe than sorry . 
  is it too late to go to the police ? 
  many modern trains have cameras at the exits so there might be a slim chance they can get a visual of his face . 
   they need to be turned back at the border which one ? 
   keep on spinning the narrative . 
  but it 's true - and not necessarily because of merkel but because of being a rich , welcoming and perceived as offering good benefits country . 
  willcomenskultur did played a part also ...  everybody , including greece , now turns around claiming that the refugees are germany 's problem . 
  big part of the trouble is that the migrants themselves see themselves as germany 's problem - or how do you explain the riots at the borders , etc. 
  and yes , germany closing their borders is the best thing you can do to greatly reduce the migrant inflow . 
   let 's acknowledge the contribution of colonialism in making some poor countries what hey are today i totally acknowledge that colonialism ** might ** have contributed to where the poor countries are today , although i believe cultural factors like endemic corruption , sectarian violence , work ethics , attitude towards the state have a bigger role . 
  the communist policies were a disaster for different reasons . 
  edit : i also do n't believe that `` europe - as a whole '' - as described in the article has any obligation . 
  if anything it has to go on a case by case . 
   united states gave $ 13 billion ( approximately $ 130 billion in current dollar value as of august 2015 )  the largest recipient of marshall plan money was the united kingdom ( receiving about 26 % of the total ) , followed by france ( 18 % ) and west germany ( 11 % ) . 
  so , germany got around ~ 14 billion at today 's value - not exactly impressive . 
  an btw , that 's much less than the amount of economic aid delivered to poor countries or how much some oil reach 3 ` rd world countries make . 
  so no , i do n't think that 's the only difference . 
  anyway , even ee countries ( russia included ) are better off without receiving any help nor having a colonial past . 
   because we 're currently feeling the effects of what happened 200 years back , not 1000 . 
  but then the argument that europe is reach because of colonialism is silly - you know , there was this great reset called ww2 . 
  just look at germany - it was never a great colonial power and at the end of ww2 it looked pretty much flattened out ( at least in the east ), 
   would there be a difference between `` kill the jews '' and `` stop the jews '' in your opinion ? 
  so `` stop the migrants '' would be hate speech then ? 
  how about `` stop the migration '' ? 
  more dead people unfortunately but otherwise probably no effect on numbers . 
   it 's just a bit absurd it 's kafka level absurd , not just a bit  i mean an old lady decides to fulfill her duty as a simple citizen of starting a referendum . 
  by accident she is well aware that in the same day the supreme court will rule on the previous question . 
  also totally by accident 16 bodyguards connected with a football club decide to hang at the entrance of the electoral authority at 6 am and also by accident they manage to help the old lady while obstructing the opposition guy . 
  that 's a shitload of accidents . 
  why would 16 bodyguards prevent a certain person from applying while helping another ? 
  this referendum is useless and you should know it , 
  / u/gerusz answers this on r/hungary [ here !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/hungary/comments/4760ku/most_kigy%c3%bart_kopaszok_pr%c3%b3b%c3%a1lj%c3%a1k_megakad%c3%a1lyozni_a/d0aj6vy ), 
  i do n't mind that it starts with `` egyet\u00e9rt-e \u00d6n ... '' / `` do you agree ... '' but that it basically asks ( in a convoluted manner ) : `` do you agree with the existing law ? '' . 
  sorry , usually referendums are held to change something not to reinforce existing laws - your quote from 2004 being also a good example `` should the parliament emit a ** new ** law wrt ... '' , etc. 
  so , according to you , this is clear and referendum worthy ? 
  : `` do you agree that retail stores - according to the law 2004/cii regulating saturday closure of retail stores - should continue being closed on saturday '' ? 
  for comparison the socialist proposal was something like : `` should the parliament cancel law 2014 cii '' ? 
   does it mean that this question is in a queue ? 
  the law allows only one question on the topic to be considered at a time - so while the opposition member was physically blocked , someone else was 5 seconds faster to send her question . 
  but , the question will now be evaluated and most probably rejected for being too vague and then the whole circus will happen again . 
   it 's like saying christian rape because the rapist was christian , or american murder because the murderer was american if the rape was committed in the name of christianity then yes , you can call it christian rape . 
  when we still had extreme left wing terrorism , it was called extreme left wing terrorism . 
   ok , sorry if i came off as less than civil no problem - people ( myself included ) admitting they got a bit uncivil are rare - thank you . 
   looking at the events through a moral perspective is like banging your head against a wall to get to the other side ( what most people do on this sub when it comes to russia ) . 
  fully agree . 
  there is a great article here : http://www.the-american-interest.com/2014/03/01/putin-smashes-washingtons-cocoon/ about the west trying to judge russia 's actions by their own values ( and failing ) . 
  as someone born in ee i can fully understand poland and baltics fears . 
   god forbid the readers realize it 's mostly young males migrating for economic reasons . 
  it 's clear from the article though - nobody complains for being oppressed or having their life threatened in greece ; but then yes , a picture is worth a thousand words ... 
  if greece blocks the summit decision would n't that mean they will end up even worse for them ? 
  i mean then it will really be each for oneself and it 's enough if any country in the path will close their border ... 
  i am serious . 
  i do n't know much about situation in georgia but if crimea is russian than moldova is definitely romanian . 
  what i was hinting at is that it 's not ok for russia to just occupy parts of foreign countries just because they want to join nato . 
  agree - but the hotspot concept was/is not very different either . 
   the relocation of refugees failed because greece did not build the hot spots another problem which might get big is that the people from countries like afghanistan or north africa are not allowed through . 
  slowly this will lead to buildups in greece , with or without hotspots . 
  nor modova nor georgia are in nato - so what are we talking about ? 
   all they want is to have a buffer zone between them and nato military infrastructure . 
  like transnistria and the part they just stole from georgia ?? 
  i understand why my statement was confusing in context , sorry about that . 
  if you are asking weather hungary can handle 2100 people then the answer is most probably yes . 
  trouble is that if we extrapolate 10 times ( assuming only 1.6 million will come to europe ) that 'll make 20 000 . 
  that 's like building a small city from nothing . 
  no , we do n't have that money . 
  as of why , there are two main aspects . 
  we do n't like to be told what to do . 
  it 's one thing to grant someone refugee status according to hungarian laws and another to take them in based on german law for example . 
  most hungarians do n't consider them refugees but economic migrants ( and their behavior while transiting hungary surely did n't changed this for the better ) . 
   a ) we agree to a quota i think one is entitled to ask this question only after the 160 k are already distributed ... 
   is this not the same orban who has been stopping the ` evil socialists ' from having a referendum ? 
  yes , although his party denies any involvement . 
   are you enjoying that corruption hungary ? 
   damn it , no !, 
  for romania is 6 000 . 
  you sir , are of genius ( or expert in constitution ) : index.hu has already an article on the same topic ( in hungarian ) : http://index.hu/belfold/2016/02/24/menekultkvota_nepszavazas_orban/, 
   are you mentioning 500 as what ? 
  as a fact . 
  in how many ways can i say that currently hungary grants ~ 500 / year ? 
   and you are also mentioning numbers like they are huge huh , where ? 
  definitely not my intention . 
   again , your economy and integration policies are in danger by 2300 people in the next two years ? 
  depending what we are supposed to do with those people - if minimal requirements - i.e. 
  provide shelter and makaron the system will survive . 
  there are three main reason most hungarians do n't want any : - lack of money - lack of support from population - lack of experience in integrating big numbers ( and doubts that it 'll actually work ) currently , hungary grants around 500 asylum requests/year . 
  if you want to say `` what a leader '' , that 'll be `` micsoda vez\u00e9r '', 
   why do n't they challenge it before eugh ? 
  hungary and slovakia already challenged this to the ecj . 
  \u00f6nteni = to pour / be = in be\u00f6nt\u00e9s = to pour something in, 
  that means `` what is the leader ! '', 
  there is a hungarian saying `` hi\u00e1nyzik mint halottnak a be\u00f6nt\u00e9s '' / as useful as a rectal cleansing to a dead person - and is sometimes used when someone does something stupid and very unnecessary . 
  anyway , the referendum results will probably be nil - i doubt they 'll manage to get 50 % +1 edit : for a referendum to be valid the participation has to be more than 50 % +1 of the population, 
   please check the `` facts '' in the article before you comment here . 
  edit : / u/tippspiel the article states that :  half of the existing transit capacity from russia to the eu is in fact unused . 
  so the article is talking about the entire network and not only north stream which you linked .
