  public perception is : we 're all equal but some are more equal . 
  political reasons : most people reject this , so parties have to kinda act accordingly . 
   lack of silence that means noise , right ? 
  the last thread of comments is probably what you are looking for ( with score bellow threshold ) . 
  thanks , corrected . 
  that was not my point though  edit : yes , that was my point . 
  we started having ~ 2k/day migrants in april - may . 
  towards end of august the number more than tripled . 
  the pdf you link is from sept 23 ` rd. 
  the discussion on how to distribute them was much more intense than how to stop them . 
  i do n't mind the slowness of ue institution - but in this case they started addressing the root problem quite late . 
  edit : date of pdf, 
  seriously now , i do n't know about italy but how many of those supposed to be in greece do you think are still there ? 
  ( hint : uncontrolled migration ? ), 
  there are several issues : public perception is that germany basically invited migrants into everybody 's countries . 
  some seem to like it . 
  we do n't . 
  whatever the number , it 's obsolete already . 
  the v4 + romania knew that if they agree now with * any * mandatory quotas more will follow soon . 
  all this while no discussion on how to stop this at source happened . 
  hypocrisy : hungary was criticized by western countries who do the same . 
  perception here is that the west is glad we 're doing the shit work while they can show their humanism . 
  there is widespread speculation that germany will keep the useful migrants ( i.e. 
  some education/work experience ) and will spread the illiterate and those suspected ( but without proof ) of being ex-criminals . 
  it is also probably one of the firsts when such a major decision is taken by majority and not unanimity . 
  heck , the greek crisis did n't involved loss of sovereignty and was still taken with unanimity . 
  public perception is : we 're all equal but some are more equal . 
  bbbb-but what about solidarity and values ?? 
   just take the `` the rule of law '' for example . 
  trouble is that this type of articles are basically saying fusk the law in the name of `` humanity '' . 
  yup - but if germany/eu pays well for each of them we would probably mind much less . 
   saying europe is not able to handle the situation and should close all of its borders is inhumane do we really need to see everything black or white ? 
  nobody said we should `` close all borders '' - but do n't allow mass uncontrolled migration !, 
   saying there is a limit to how many refugees europe can take the answer to this question depends a lot at what you mean by `` take '' . 
  we can not force asylum seekers to stay in hungary ... 
  at the part where she extends her leg - i do n't have software to analyse video on this comp so i could be easily wrong . 
  am i the only one who thinks few frames are missing ? 
  simple : with money !, 
  in one picture it a hand gun is visible on the croatian police . 
  however , it was not an invasion , the hungarian police asked them to come . 
  the title says `` number of migrants caught in hungary - search by date '' . 
  first dropdown is the year , second is the month , `` lekerdezes '' button means search . 
  bonus point if you spot the time where germany starts making statements which could been interpreted as `` all refugees are welcome '', 
  you mean something like a fence ? 
   we could have simply closed the borders how ? 
  i mean the migrants do n't really cross via official crossing point and showing their passports ... 
   when hungary closed the border , they did so for everything , and from both sides hungary did n't really closed the border , only the entry points where you had large masses of migrants . 
  ( i mean there were 2000 people camping on the road , not really safe to keep it open in any direction ) . 
  they should sit , yell , argue , compromise , yell some more , compromise some more and do n't get out without a common solution . 
  no more pissing contests via press releases !, 
  tbh , even people in helsinki consider the ones in oulu `` a bit weird '' , 
  agree - would n't make sense to build like crazy when we could just ship everyone to austria . 
  not yet , bama.hu reports the steel gate was a rehersal . 
  i ca n't link to facebook video due to auto moderator but you can see it at report from 16:39 from [ bama.hu ] ( http://www.bama.hu/baranya/kozelet/a-migransok-atleptek-a-baranyai-hatart-illocskan-bukkantak-fel-629808 ), 
  that is from 2012 in stuttgart , people were booing about some train station . 
  has no friggin relation with the migrants !, 
  you know that 's from 2012 in stuttgart , right ? 
  also i think people were unhappy about a train station or something . 
  it starts at 0:45 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tfbh9be6rs, 
  that 's the makaron guy , lol . 
  go to doctor ? 
  [ this ] ( http://444.hu/2015/09/19/horgos/ ) is the best account i found of the events ( nb . 
  444 . hu is deffinitely not a pro orban site ) . 
  also ferenc gyurcsany should rather hide under a rock rather than speaking of police brutality - his 2006 intervention on people opposing him will go into history : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_protests_in_hungary#day_8:_monday.2c_september_25.2c_2006 tldr ; migrants attacking the gate/police for few hours . 
  after that the police retreated 30m into hungarian territory . 
  migrants interpreted that as `` all open '' and moved in ( that partially explains the number of kids ) ; police intervening with tear gas allegedly with no warning . 
  please consider that the police on the border has a fucked up job - serbia already complained of hungarian water on their territory prompting a stream of fb jokes like `` why is the grass greener in serbia ? 
  because we watered it ! '', 
  oh please , even if she would had tripped the devil himself her action are still extremely shameful !, 
  dang good point dude !, 
   i think mods are stressed enough as it is . 
  agree . 
  how would you feel though if a mod of / r/europe would say `` lithuanian are complete awful cunts '' ? 
  for some reason , i do n't like his stance wrt hungarians . 
  btw : is n't generalizing of hatred towards an entire nation considered racist ? 
  i do n't blame unhcr ( even if i disagree with their stance on hungary ) - it 's their job to make sure refugees get the best . 
  media on the other side was very meh to put it mildly . 
   since by law ( eu , un ) you cant keep them in the camps same laws state that refugees must obey local laws ... 
  no offence , but it 's been posted already : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3lkvln/sweden_vs_denmark_debate_refugees_so_close_but_so/, 
  that is absolutely correct . 
  i remember reading a report a while ago that the restaurateurs were using tooth brushes . 
  hungarians do n't really use standalone kurva , but it 's the only common curse word that came to my mind , 
  it 's from 3 days ago when hungarian police used tear gas . 
   it took , like , five years to wash the parliament building more than 10 actually . 
  look at this statistic and tell me if you really think all we did was bussing them around : http://www.dpa-international.com/images/26/63/33/64/00/00/278e2800c354bf48.jpg and agree , hungary should talk to its neighbors !!!!, 
  bbut , do n't you guys do the same ? 
  field report of the croatian-hungarian war : hungary sent both tanks to occupy croatia . 
  croatia responded by sending both of their tanks too . 
  unfortunately all tanks broke on the way and due to the lack of soviet spare parts the mechanical warfare had to be canceled , to the disappointment of german tourists which came en mass to witness the event and spent the day placing towels on the beach chairs . 
  both croatian migs landed in bucharest due to autocorrect function in their iphones . 
  both hungarian grippens landed also there after experiencing a mysterious quantum anomaly pushing them towards east ( i.e. 
  romanian prime minister declares that this is a gross manipulation of ex-president basescu and will propose deporting all pilots to vaslui county . 
  out of other options hungary infantry attacked with shots of palinka to which croatia responded with a surprise sljivovica counter attack . 
  the situation got quickly confusing since both party used the ancient battle-cry `` kurva '' so one could n't tell anymore friend and foe . 
  it is unclear who won the fierce battle , both sides claiming clear victory . 
  aftermath reports show a large number of injured , clearly in shock state , with trembling hands , difficulty on walking straight and hypersensitivity to strong light and noise . 
  austrian experts suspect this is a previously unknown form of ptsd . 
  in unrelated news , the pharmacy nearby reports they ran out of painkillers the morning after . 
  no , 4 weeks ago the inflow started to double . 
  coincidentally that 's around when messages like `` all refugees are welcome '' and `` there is no limit '' and `` germany really needs all the migrants to fix its demographics '' started to flow in the press .
