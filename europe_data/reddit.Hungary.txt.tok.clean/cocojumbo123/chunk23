  right ? 
  i am not disagreeing with you on taxation - but why are you assuming all uber drivers are cheaters and all legit taxi drivers are paying taxes ? 
  was it a trip from airport to the city ? 
  that was probably somebody renting his car from a taxi company - every day they have to pay x amount of money regardless of how many trips they made . 
  should n't they be protesting those who asked them to `` modify their cars , to get the necessary papers and documents and licenses for themselves and their cars and in budapest they have to follow a fare table '' . 
  also do you find it normal that someone tries to forbid me onto whose car i am using ? 
  the dw link ( assuming auto translation is correct ) and the video are telling the opposite thing though . 
  sorry , it 's a duplicate : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/409pwp/i_went_to_join_isis_in_syria_taking_my/, 
   abroad , merkel will work for burden sharing , ** tougher measures to patrol europe 's borders ** and seek solutions to stop the refugees at source  already the ** venomous ** hungarian leader viktor orb\u00e1n is calling for ** tougher border controls ** ... no comment edit : i 'm rightfully banned on / r/europe for 7 days , if you need a reply earlier than this please pm me . 
  ok , let me rephrase : assuming all those countries will close their doors , what do you think will happen ? 
  ( as you said austria will be overwhelmed quite quickly + they do n't have a problem with fences ; probably switzerland will vote it down ) . 
   yet people are going after us claiming that we are opposed to any action hindering the flow . 
  that 's probably because the mandatory quotas got much higher bandwidth . 
  on the domino effect : do you really think that the same number of people will try to come to europe if they 'll know there is no chance on earth to pass to germany ? 
  i agree with the protecting of external border as the best solution . 
   let 's say the population is split 50/50 on the refugee issue it is more like 25 % very anti 25 % very pro and the rest in the middle in my opinion . 
  the very anti ones wo n't experience any dissonance - just a reconfirmation of their believes . 
  the 25 % pro will have had a strong dissonance - this is for example why we had a few scifi explanations like the koln assaults were the job of the right wing  in case of germany - due to media message i 'd say the 50 % were initially more pro than anti . 
  now they are experiencing a cognitive dissonance moving ( part of them ) to the anti camp . 
  ( that 's why support for right parties is increasing ) . 
  honestly , do you think germany can handle another million ? 
  ( slovenian police reports 20k in the first week of jan ) . 
  the change to mentality is due to [ cognitive dissonance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cognitive_dissonance ) . 
  should n't the message in the beginning be `` oh those poor highly educated woman and children '' fleeing war but a more accurate description of reality , people would n't so shocked now . 
   but do people seriously think we can just close our borders ... 
  yes . 
   also , the right to seek asylum is part of our constitution was n't it so that per german law you do n't have to take anyone coming from a safe country ? 
  idk what to say , there were the reports with `` many ladies crying '' and also that a po lady in plain clothes was assaulted . 
  i 'd guess there was also a ( miss ) communication problem between ranks . 
  talking of italians - actually e-u-ro-pa with latin phonetics sounds quite good to me . 
  good point - clapping is a must !, 
  ( the spacex stuff did n't wave any flags though ) . 
   are you implying that they go through slovenia ? 
  i 'm not implying , i know for sure - it 's in all papers  current main route is greece - macedonia - serbia - croatia - slovenia . 
   if your fence is working why does eu need to do more in northen greece ? 
  our fence works for us , orban was talking about the whole eu . 
   why not in slovenia ? 
  no idea - i did n't had time to listen to the interview . 
  my wild guess is he considers that border easier to defend . 
  for example if we have a border at slovenian border the migrant flow might change to serbia - romania - hungary or serbia - romania - ukraine . 
  mob justice is not a good idea in a democratic country . 
  also , generally speaking , if left unchecked , vigilante/militias can grow dangerous - e.g. 
  in ukraine ( although i seriously doubt that 'll ever happen in finland ) . 
  during latest spacex launch ( and booster landing ) the stuff spontaneously started chanting usa-usa . 
  what shall we chant ? 
  europe-europe ( with english phonetics ) or eu-eu . 
   the police in cologne declined that offer . 
  wow . 
  did he provide an explanation on why ? 
  was it overconfidence or there is some historic riff-raff betweeh state and city ? 
  sir , you do n't need to copy the content of the article in the comment if the article is in english , 
  no offence , but internally orban held to his promises better than his predecessors in the office . 
  also i do n't remember him saying one thing today and the opposite shortly after . 
   the islands we have are all eu soil . 
  which means asylum seekers can request asylum in the eu . 
  fully agree . 
  but also does n't mean that we have to ferry them to wherever they want while they wait for application processing - so it will bring a bit of control in this mess . 
  they can not cross through hungary anymore - something something fence . 
  ca n't comment on situation in poland but the hungarian portrait is fairly accurate . 
  it will have if you kick us out , lol . 
  do n't be so harsh on slovenia . 
  they ca n't do much unless they fence-up and get a ton of help ( they do n't have enough police/border guards to handle it alone ) . 
  kindly reminding you that your own chancellor asked us to open the flood gates . 
  also , while at it , consider kicking out austria as well . 
  yup , and around 0 since then . 
  we do n't like putin either , 
  also , if i recall right , it was assumed that many arsonists are middle class people without prior involvement in right-wing activism of any kind . 
   in that case we should kick out slovenia and hungary first . 
  live us out of it - there are virtually 0 migrants crossing through hungary :p, 
   `` it 's not politically correct to say anything against migrants . 
  we do n't have freedom of opinion anymore . 
  #cologne , '' tweeted a german user from hanover it 's stuff like this that makes me scratch my head . 
  because if true it basically means ( some ) people are afraid to openly criticize their government policies . 
  which is not good . 
  ( sorry for the downvotes , btw ) . 
  it 's the national sport - i do n't know if we beat romanians at it though . 
  probably a tie . 
   but also there are many specific cultural differences ( mostly in our favor imo ) between east and west . 
  yes , that 's the reason i also use the ee term - otherwise it just gets too long to list all countries each time . 
  hehe , you are right - but only partly . 
  the taxes on banks and telecom went to the state budget - so it also went to the poor . 
  if you remember , the imf was recommending to raise the taxes for population . 
  also the bail-out ( at bank expenses ) of people with chf loans went to poor/middle class . 
   because orb\u00e1n is the only european politician to have bled the fat cats of banking and commerce in true robin hood style . 
  well , this part is true at least ... 
  hes more like brittish - born from hungarian parents who fled in ' 56 . 
  anyway , some of the most critical ones in nyt and guardian were also written by hungarians . 
  am i the only one who does n't get it ? 
  you can censor speech but you ca n't censor thoughts . 
  usually , people who feel they ca n't express themselves will hold on until a sparkle will cause an explosive release . 
   there 's something about having being part of eastern europe  hungary is central yurop !!, 
  relax - it 's referring to political ee ( i.e. 
  ex commies ) . 
  anyway , i can hardly believe there is an article in mainstream western media speaking so nicely of viktator - got used to the opposite in the last years . 
  moreover , starting this year nokia can sell again phones under nokia name . 
   it would be chaos in hungary sorry to say but the `` chaos '' was kind of exaggerated . 
  there were 3000 migrants marching on the highway indeed but what do you think will happen if 3000 hungarians would do the same ? 
  ( hint : they 'll be dispersed by riot police within 15 minutes - according to the law ) . 
  orban would n't have had a problem on doing so if publicly requested by merkel - she chose the other way ; we gladly obliged . 
   more to the point , how the hell is hungary even dealing with the 200k over the last 12 months ?
