  ( notable exception - rtl klub ) . 
  also we have a state media conglomerate which nobody really watches/reads which a huge budget ( from our tax money ) . 
  and yes , orban and friends try to control the message - sometimes in a subtle manner ( state provided commercials ) , sometimes not so subtle . 
  for the migrant crisis i was pointing out that even the independent media in the west were biased as fuck - i.e. 
  just being independent does n't necessarily means unbiased coverage . 
  do n't be so harsh . 
  we had 50 years of communism with state controlled media . 
  after '89 media is controlled by whomever pays the bills ( mostly new rich ) who use it as a tool for political pressure . 
  anyway , after my country got vilified in the `` independent '' media wrt migrant crisis it makes me wander whether it 's that different . 
  i can see that now poor poland is the new bad of europe . 
  nah , your government seem to have taken the script from your friendly brothers . 
   if people want west and eastern europe to become closer the disparity between how they treat non-eu foreigners has to become narrower . 
  sorry , i do n't get it , what has one to do with the other ? 
   nobody is asking hungary to take a billion immigrants no , but merkel already spoke of permanent relocation system . 
  based on the 1 million so far that 'll make 22 000 only for this year 's arrivals . 
  and left wing will cry `` nazi dictatorship '' whenever someone disagrees with them . 
  i dislike both . 
   hungary had a referendum on accepting migrants . 
  errr , nope . 
  you are right about the rest but there was no referendum . 
  what bugs me is that nobody seems to worry that only 1 % of the initial 160 000 were reallocated so far . 
  seems hypocrisy pays off . 
  yes , that was a blind spot for the cameras , 
  usually if i ask someone a question in the airport in english , they will answer in english . 
  if they address me first in local language they 'll switch to english if i tell `` sorry , i do n't speak < local language  '' in cdg the dialogue started like this : `` me : do you speak english ? '', 
  `` oui '' `` me : where is gate xyz ? '', 
  - then proceeds on answering my question in french . 
  granted , this was 8 years ago , the situation might be better now . 
  errr , sk\u00e5l !? 
   i understood the joke , but you did n't understand my explanation that i did . 
  i am drunk . 
  me understand scandinavians perfectly . 
   - just needed an excuse to attach the polandball comic ... 
  bacause as per eu regulation they would have had to pay me 600 eur if my flight was delayed for 24 hours ( next day ) due to their fault . 
  as opposed to op 's story they did paid for one night in hotel and one meal though . 
  no , the joke is that any soil is russian soil if they choose so :p ( just like crimea ) here 's a typical polandball comic : http://imgur.com/a/sjpqv, 
  there is a loophole - once i booked a flight budapest - amsterdam - chengdu ( china ) , all through klm . 
  the budapest - amsterdam leg was operated by malev ( still existing at that time ) and it was late so i missed the connecting flight . 
  the klm lady at the customer office in amsterdam was extremely aggressive and explained me that it 's irrelevant that i bought my tickets from klm . 
  since first leg was malev , it 's their fault , not klm 's . 
  that 's one of the reasons on why i avoid klm like plague . 
   i was surprised to see ( smell ) airport staff casually smoking in the airport . 
  good memories . 
  one cdg staff member , 6 chinese and myself smoking behind a pillar after a beijing - france flight . 
  ( influenced by polandball ) - if our commie joke was that russia has whatever neighbors they choose , that means they can claim whatever land they want . 
   then , instead of simply shutting the door and going back to watch some tv it decided to help them . 
  i know - but it 's not how it went down on world 's media . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=refugees+welcome&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=cdr%3a1%2ccd_min%3a8%2f15%2f2015%2ccd_max%3a9%2f15%2f2015&amp;tbm=#safe=off&amp;tbs=cdr:1%2ccd_min:8%2f15%2f2015%2ccd_max:9%2f15%2f2015&amp;q=refugees+welcome+germany ) a google search for `` refugees welcome germany '' filtered for aug 15 - sept 15 so yes , to use your analogy , you will not be off the hook until you really shut the door and go back to watch tv ( and let the rest of the planet know that you did so ) . 
   it never was a `` you are welcome '' . 
  oh , c'mon - there were hundreds/thousands of ordinary people holding banners with `` refugees welcome '' . 
  ( and merkel 's selfies ) - seriously , can you imagine obama making selfies with mexican illegal migrants ? 
   oh ... you are in serious trouble , i 'll guess i help you then ! '' . 
  yes ... that 's the key point if we examine the underlying assumptions ( it 's always useful to look at the underlying assumptions ) - for example : if germany would had hermetically closed it 's borders 6 months ago , do you think that any of the migrants ( already on eu soil ) would had been killed or persecuted ? 
  hungary said/thought `` most of this people are economic migrants , there is no war at our borders '' . 
  germany said/thought `` most of this people are syrian refugees flying war and isis '' - our leaders must clarify this and come with a common view . 
  and what makes you think they 'd be happy to be resettled in ee ( and stay there ) ? 
   people have irrational fear for immigrants here agree . 
   it 's bit ridiculous no . 
  it 's basic human nature . 
  any evolutionary psychology manual shows that `` homo homini lupus '' . 
   look at poland . 
  look at their late politics , and this is just a light sneeze compared what is to come . 
  your point here is very unclear . 
   we can force resettlement nope . 
  only a dictatorship can force resettlement . 
   so they will either go back to middle east , or will refugee themselves back in southern europe or germany ( which will just prove how stupid the policy is ) . 
  agree . 
  problem is that in the `` west '' , being poor means `` ca n't buy nice things '' . 
  in the `` east '' that means `` ca n't buy enough food to feed myself/my family '' . 
  i 'm using east-west in political terms not geographical . 
  ( e.g eesti is in the eeeeeeest ) . 
  allocate the money you would use for integrating migrants for raising the `` local '' babies for example ? 
  fyi : i always upvote the comments i reply to as per rediquette . 
  ok , why do you hate us ? 
   i am pretty sure there are hundred thousands of refugees who would be very happy to get resettled to romania and other `` poor '' countries . 
  lol , any base for this claim ? 
  i am pretty sure though that half of vaslui county ( in romania ) or half of borsod-aba\u00faj-zempl\u00e9n county ( hungary ) will be more than happy to live as refugees in germany . 
  the thing this type of reports seems to ignore is that the migrants are human beings with wishes on where they would like to be . 
  and more often than not , they seem very determined on going where they want to ( attacking police , refuse to be fingerprinted , etc ) . 
  agree sweden is russia clay as everyone knows . 
  there was this joke in commie times `` q : who are the neighbors of glorious ussr ? 
  a : whomever they want to ! '', 
  easy : charles de gaule - paris very non-intuitively check-in process , employees do n't ( want to ) speak english , lost luggage when transferring . 
  somebody is always in strike ( rer , luggage handlers , cabin attendants , etc ) edit : lmao , i wrote the reply before reading the content of your submission . 
  yes , contrary to many in / r/europe , i fully agree that germany never explicitly invited anyone . 
  bur honestly , if i tell you `` you are welcome in my house '' how will you interpret that ? 
  do n't come ? 
  and yes , that 's one more price to pay for being a rich country with extremely high morals . 
  if hungary would had said `` refugees welcome '' we would have probably have a few hundreds . 
  also i find it hard to believe that merkel ( probably the most powerful woman on the planet ) did n't knew how her speach , selfies and decisions would be interpreted . 
  edit : i think things will start to change if germany removes many of the little worm holes in the deportation laws so that only genuine refugees can stay . 
  wow , there are not so many people on reddit with a german flag to make such bold statements . 
   which , to be frank , is not germany problem partly agree . 
  as any economical superpower , germany is a big magnet for all migrants ( regardless of their origin ) . 
  but when you got a very explicit `` refugees welcome '' messages this magnet just got 10 times more powerful and yes , i hold germany responsible for that . 
  edit : do n't get me wrong . 
  germany , like any country on the planet , has all rights to defend their border and decide on whom to allow in . 
  orban ( whom i dislike ) accused germany of `` moral imperialism '' . 
  that means that germany shows high morals ( `` refugees welcome '' ) while pressuring the rest of eu into taking them ( `` refugees welcome ... in poland '' ) . 
  therefore , unless there is an official `` migrants not welcome '' message not much will change .
