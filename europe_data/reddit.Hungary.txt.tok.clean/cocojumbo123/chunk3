  i mean , what do you think the migrants are reading : the press releases of the german government ( and understanding the nuances of the german language ) or the headlines in the international media . 
   hungary basically mass transport them to austria noooo , hungary takes them to `` registration camps '' which purely by coincidence happen to be near the austrian border . 
  i imagine our police is telling something like : `` the border is 200 m in that direction , please wait here until morning so that we can register you '' . 
  it get 's better - the hungarian police says the croatian police did n't bear weapons and they were barely id-d after which they were escorted back to the state border . 
  nah , in movies , germans always speak english with a `` german '' accent . 
  the train bringing 1000 migrants in hungary had an escort of 40 armed croatian pos - so yes , they crossed the border . 
  state media is reporting they were disarmed , no word of being arrested . 
  you win :d, 
  lmao , it was just reported that hungary arrested 40 croatian policeman for human traficking !,

  now please , do n't tell me the hungarians had no idea it 's coming ... http://index.indavideo.hu/video/orak_alatt_szalltak_at_a_horvat_vonatrol_a_magyarra_nezze_meg_masfel_percben edit 2 : the reports are now only mentioning that the pos were disarmed . 
  edit : translation : `` 40 croatian policeman were disarmed and taken into custody , as well as the train conductor which brought the migrants to magyarb\u00f3ly according to the declaration of bakondi gy\u00f6rgy , chief adviser on external affairs of orban cabinet . 
  he also mentioned that a whole train with migrants and police represents an unimaginable violation of the state border '', 
  nah , we still love going adria , drinking together and each side speaking in their own language about the idiocy of politicians , 
  i ca n't find one single article since i read most of it in livestreams . 
  for example : http://index.hu/belfold/2015/09/15/menekult_lezart_hatar_roszke_valsaghelyzet_menekultvalsag/830_menekult_jott_vonattal_horvatorszagbol/ - 830 migrants came by train from croatia . 
  hungary had a train with 10 coaches waiting for them . 
  also theguardian mentions it : http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/sep/18/refugee-crisis-hungary-builds-border-fence-with-croatia-live-updates#block-55fc1a52e4b0ec17e56c7ce2 ( the hungarian buses were already waiting when the croatian ones arrived ), 
  source for what ? 
  declaration of our minister or that hungary was prepared ? 
  i 'll bait : how about indonesia ? 
  there is something going on - during morning one minister declared there are no contacts with croatia . 
  however , when croatia sent migrants to hungary , the authorities had the logistic support in place so it 's clear there has been some discussion . 
  also it 's surprising hungary decided to let them in . 
  i still do n't understand why take them on the other side of the country thou - with the speed of bkk buses that 'll take 4-5 hours . 
  the reporter overheard a conversation between two policeman : http://index.hu/belfold/2015/09/15/menekult_lezart_hatar_roszke_valsaghelyzet_menekultvalsag/vamosszabadiba_vihetik_a_menekulteket_beremendrol/, 
   austria will be delighted edit : now it looks they 'll send them to slovakian border in vamosszabadi . 
  reports are saying that hungary is taking them to the austrian border indeed . 
  there is no info yet weather will attempt to register them or not . 
   their plan now is to return them to croatia , but once overwhelmed , they might start dumping them somewhere . 
  looks more and more there 'll be a big hide and seek game with every country moving the migrants close to the border of another one . 
  ( there are some rumurs in hungarian media that serbia will send some next to the romanian border ), 
  why ? 
  once slovenia will be overwhelmed they 'll just let them pass . 
  i remember when jacques chirac tried to get the olympics in france by stating : `` you ca n't trust people who cook as badly as that , '' he said of the british . 
  `` after finland , it 's the country with the worst food . '', 
  yeah , especially since many of them are from said countries ... , 
   yeah , but getting into hungary illegally = criminal record and ban from schengen for 1 or 2 years . 
  only if they go over the fence - without it they can claim they did n't knew they crossed the border . 
  probably someone is trolling - i hope . 
   because they were packed beyond the point of safety , so austria needed 2 trains for every 1 hungarian one arriving . 
  they were packed because they did n't wanted to get off the train , the police did n't want to do it by force ( 'cause then we 'd get called nazis ) and a riot was about to start . 
   there are no large refugee camps in graz , only temporary places to stay for the night aka . 
  shelters . 
  sorry , i fail to understand what 's the difference . 
  so if they are moved to a large camp it 's `` our darkest time '' and if they are moved to `` temporary places '' it 's fine ? 
  can we stop pointing fingers now please ? 
  definitely not offensive - complaining about our authorities is a national sport . 
  i do n't think the bad conditions were created on purpose since nobody wanted to stay in hungary either . 
  but at the same time , i do n't think the authorities were too enthusiastic about providing good conditions either , more like minimum to get by . 
  at the same time please note that for most of the time hungary tried to respect the schengen treaty ( and register everybody , whether they like it or not ) . 
  it would had been much simpler to just put them on trains to the austrian border ( which we did ) but then also austria did the same before germany closed their borders . 
  but please also consider the following : austria and germany closed their borders after 1 week of uncontrolled migration . 
  hungary had the said migration for 2 months . 
  even assuming our authorities are competent there 's no way they could had provided the same conditions as in germany . 
  also the behavior of refugees aggravated the things . 
  for example most of them would rather spend their nights on the fields rather than being taken to shelters ( because there they would have had to register ) . 
  tldr ; hungary could have done much better in handling the situation but this does n't justify the demonization ongoing in the last couple of weeks . 
  may i ask why you deleted your previous reply ? 
  - there were some really good questions there . 
  the hungarian article refers to the timeline when austria stopped allowing the trains to pass . 
  in consequence mav had to cancel all trains to austria . 
  now , you had a big bunch ( 3-4 k ) of migrants stranded in keleti . 
  some of them boarded a train which authorities took to bicske refugee camp - a move which your pm named nazi . 
  ( and if i remember well nobody promised them that train will go to austria but could be wrong ) . 
  now if hungary does it , it 's nazi , if austria does it there are good reasons ? 
  i think hungarian authorities could have handled the organization of shelters way better but incompetence is strong with them . 
  i do n't know about other countries but in hungary opposition will always bash the government . 
  also gyurcsany 's party opposed granting citizenship to hungarian from abroad arguing that they 'll take our jobs , overload the social security system , etc. 
  are you really saying that hungary had death camps or something ? 
  also could you please link to the unhcr sources ? 
  sadly as far as i can remember two people died . 
  one had a heart attack while the other was hit by a car on a dark road while running away for not being registered here . 
  i think everybody ( refuges included ) would have been better off if she ( and her ministers ) would have just keep their mouths shut . 
  this reminds me of a joke i heard in romania : a romanian and a hungarian go fishing and they catch the magical golden fish which grants each of them a wish . 
  hungarian asks immediately for a chinese wall replica to surrender whole motherland ( transylvania included ) while romanians are left out . 
  romanian 's turn : hey , does that wall has any doors , windows or cracks ? 
  nope , it 's perfect , the fish replied proudly . 
  perfect , then i wish you fill it with water !, 
  i giggled ... ooooh wait a sec ... brb !, 
   if you 'd rather turn away on people so clearly in need , there are more than 3 billion people on this planet `` clearly in need '' - i.e. 
  living with less than 2usd/day . 
  how do you plan on distributing them ? 
  alas , if those people are so much in need why is it that those needs can be satisfied only in germany , sweden and to some extent uk ? 
   i do n't want to be in a union with you either . 
  allow me to clarify a bit how things are seen around here . 
  there is a perception that germany basically invited the refuges and then telling `` whoops , we must share the load '' . 
  also , we are poor countries and the government here ca n't just produce 6b eur out of their ass !, 
  also v4 + romania have n't experienced yet `` multiculturalism '' ( whatever that is ) - and they do n't want to handle big masses of very culturally different people . 
  edit : i am not stating that one is right and other wrong , just describing the situation . 
  so , being in the union means in your opinion that those countries must accept the same multiculturalism that germany has , just because it says so ? 
  and who would feed the crocodiles and the sharks in the moat ? 
  you could have at least taken it before we started renovating it , not after !!, 
  thanks for explaining . 
  what is the default action in inconclusive cases ? 
  sad , but i lolled !, 
  still waiting for * any * sources ... 
  not engaging into war does n't mean supporting , lol ... and you 'll have to provide a source about the `` west '' `` cheering at the invasion of czechoslovakia '' . 
  and yugoslavia was part of the eastern block btw , although tito played it differently . 
  same thing with ceausescu .
