  the european union should conceive a list of safe countries ( each eu member state should be regarded as safe , including greece ) . 
  refugees [ of war ] should be separated from economic immigrants right outside the schengen area, 
  and achieve what exactly ? 
   also eastern europe has been adamantly pushing against a european solution i respectfuly disagree . 
  ee is opposing the german solution on the grounds that it 's not a solution . 
  it will take many erasmus babies until that 'll happen , but i fully agree as well . 
   which often upsets the reddit nationalist hive . 
  no offense , but what does following the laws has to do with nationalism ? 
  it 's not exactly `` dumping '' . 
  the problem has legs and will move on its own . 
  in this case is more like slovenia worrying that germany will not let them in . 
  this will make transit countries even less willing to register anyone . 
  fear of dublin was also one of the main drivers for our great fence - anyone knows a publicly traded fence company ? 
  ( looks like business will be booming ) . 
   when we spend billions on military transport planes that ca n't fly , defective drones ... and broomsticks , 
  this is an epic middle finger in the face of ukraine . 
   start a new life in ** europe ** i am sure you meant germany or sweden :p, 
  i never blamed germany for creating the migration wave . 
  i do blame it for ( unwillingly ) creating a huge migrational pull factor towards itself and for very bad handling of the inflow . 
  edit : and one more thing . 
  if cut of price for rations is the reason , where did they get several thousand eur for the trip ? 
   if eastern europeans showed actual solidarity solidarity with germany 's stupid decision ? 
  no thanks . 
  or with what ? 
   this situation would n't be as dramatic as it is . 
  do you even math ? 
  v4 + romania are supposed to take ~ 18 % of the quota based on junker proposal . 
  sure , the situation would n't be as dramatic for 1 more week then you 'd be back in shit - even assuming they 'll stay put in those countries ( they wo n't ) . 
  edit : the difference would be that ee will be in shit as well . 
  is this what you mean by solidarity ? 
  sorry , but believing that the only thing between universal happiness and dramatic situation are 4 ( four ) small countries in ee is delusional -  pointing fingers . 
   as soon as the refugees enter eu soil correction : until their status is clarified they are migrants . 
  upon arrival , upon said geneva convention they should apply for asylum . 
  if they do n't do it they are illegal migrants based on any international law . 
   germany did n't invite the refugees no , just made sure that world , dog and sausage sees the `` refugees welcome '' signs and press releases . 
   which somehow eastern europeans now use as am excuse citation badly needed . 
  can you get down for a sec from the high moral horse ? 
  to my knowledge less refugees were attacked in ee than in germany . 
  just saying . 
  i always upvote comments i 'm replying to , also in this case . 
  why do you have to assume that the only solution to the problem is to `` take people in '' ? 
   because its much easier to believe that half of syria suddenly had a case of wanderlust what happened then ? 
  it 's not like the war in syria started in may ... 
  and what was it last week ? 
   the problem is the countries that refuse to take their responsibility . 
  could you please define `` responsibility '' ? 
  for example , i could argue that right now sweden is behaving irresponsibly !, 
   you sound so incredibly misinformed that it hurts to read . 
   you can take off your tin foil hat in 4 months sounds a bit insulting to me . 
  something something solidarity ? 
  no mention of alcohol ??? 
  even weird drinks like fisu or salmiakki ? 
  france already mentioned they 'll take a limited amount . 
  idk about belgium or ireland . 
  i do n't mind that orban rise . 
  i mind there is no true alternative . 
  currently party # 2 is jobiik - full blown extreme right ( anti gypsy , anti jews , anti eu ) , although they tried to tone it down a bit lately . 
  former # 1 ( socialists ) - managed to broke into 3-4 smaller parts and ca n't manage to pull their shit together . 
  heck , to them , it was benny hill level even nominating a unique major candidate for budapest . 
  with the current `` winner takes all '' system , they stand no chance . 
  the only normal party is lmp ( equivalent to green parties elsewhere in europe ) - i.e. 
  center - left - left but they are quite small , constantly struggling to make it to the parliament . 
  there were high hopes that some new party would emerge from the anti-internet-tax movement but this possibility seems further and further away . 
  tl ; dr : even excluding migrant crisis , orban is the least shittiest option we currently have, 
   the refugees will just move to other countries . 
  which ones ? 
   having people live in camps anywhere is still far worse than letting them come to functioning countries and letting them start decent lifes there nobody disagrees with that . 
  but there are a few issues : - capacity : europe can not grant european standards of living to everyone banging at the doors . 
  - morality : is it moral to take in the system people whom did n't contributed to the system if the result is degradation of said system ? 
  - ethics : who gets to decide whom can come to europe and who can not ? 
  currently it 's a darwinian race , the financially potent can enter it while the poor are left behind . 
  edit : grammar, 
  yup . 
  it 's a vicious circle . 
  they wo n't integrate until considered equal and they wo n't be considered equal until they integrate . 
  the part which describes situation in france applies quite well to gypsies in ee - racism/discrimination ( it exists ) - at least in romania and hungary they are not really considered romanians or hungarians for example when some report of crime done by romanians elsewhere , the thread is full of people explaining `` those are not really romanians , they are gypsies whom happen to have citizenship '', 
  this was posted few days back - my comment is the same . 
  so basically this article states all eu institutions are useless and the only one who can do something is merkel . 
  without her everyone else would run around like chickens during earthquake . 
  sorry , if that is true , that 's not a union anymore . 
  does the receiving states provide anything for people in eu migration ? 
   register in a border country with overcrowded camps , fully aware that you 'll be part of the mess that the dublin treaty is creating in those places ? 
  is their life threatened/are they being persecuted in said camps ? 
   their decision to travel through at least half a dozen safe countries was purely an economic decision . 
  that 's a really good point !, 
  what is the country they stopped fearing for their lives ? 
  from there on it 's all economic migration ( bar family reunification ) . 
  great article , thanks for sharing . 
  mozart , bach , verdi , wagner , bartok - hard to choose . 
  paywall :( - does n't work in incognito mode either . 
  the title says `` hungary ** prepares ** law allowing spies to pose as journalists '' - not yet adopted . 
  let 's hope our idiotic government come to their senses or that brussels slaps them . 
   you profited alot from the eu . 
  no one claimed differently . 
  i am also extremely grateful and strongly believe ee would be in much worse shape without eu . 
  does belonging to eu ( and profiting out of it ) means we shall do whatever germany wants ? 
  because then we should change the `` u '' with `` c '' - as in colony . 
  i am sick and tired of all this `` solidarity '' talk . 
  convince uk to take part - that would be solidarity . 
  heck , even france is dragging their feet .
