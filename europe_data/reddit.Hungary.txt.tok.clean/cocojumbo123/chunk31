  for ee just say the truth `` you will accept the quota because you signed the friggin ' lisbon treaty '' !, 
   because they are signatories of the un refugee convention ? 
  i know , i know , following treaties you have signed is for losers . 
  i find your comment malicious . 
  hungary pledged to respect all international laws - heck , we 'll even respect the quota after challenging it in court . 
  ( or pay the 0.6 fine ) . 
  one simple question : do we have to provide an european standard of living to everyone banging at the borders ? 
   but for fucks sake the union should stand together in though times and it just annoys me that it is n't that makes us two   you do n't understand what this is about . 
  i do . 
  was just pointing out that solidarity should be a two way street based on dialogue . 
   ... allies hungary and v4 did n't oppose quotas per se - they insisted we should first stop the inflow , then talk about redistribution but no , merkel went `` my way or the highway '' . 
  also , can we also talk about germany opposing the nato base in poland as well as north stream ? 
  are we allies only when we do as ordered ? 
  in theory some countries might jail persons who are illegally crossing a border . 
  i am really curious if it 'll still be 20-4 when the next 100 000 gets redistributed . 
   maybe your country just is n't trying to be welcoming to refugees ? 
  and why should a country be welcoming to migrants ? 
  also paying refugees more than the locals ( you know the ones who contributed to social services ) is political and economical suicide . 
  i did n't downvoted you . 
  lol , no true scotsman fallacy with irish . 
  apparently you can not be racist against white people / s, 
  i was reading somewhere that in finland , kindergarden kids are being told `` being born in finland is like winning the lottery '' guess , they decided to put the money where the word is . 
  you are probably right ( my german stops at swaine axe , weisenbier , bitte ) - but per rules of / r/europe you can not editorialize a title ( not even when translated ) . 
   since the article is not very in depth , what are the consequences ? 
  consequences of what ? 
   it seems that they only decided to sue the eu for implementing these quotas yes , that is the eu official way on handling disagreements . 
   does anyone know what their argument is ? 
  i have n't read anything about it yet . 
  but it 's not hard to guess : testing the limits of lisbon treaty - for example why for schengen accession you need unanimity ( hi romania and bulgaria ) while for relocating large masses of people the qualified majority applies . 
   can you tell me more about dublin v4 v4 is commonly used for visegrad 4 countries ( poland , czech republic , slovakia and hungary ) . 
   perhaps i was unclear ? 
  you were clear . 
  geographically the distance is the same . 
  and as long as germany has an `` open door '' policy it does n't matter whether it 's `` old eu '' or `` new eu '' , they 'll come . 
   by having actual efficient control on the outer border of the area this is exactly what v4 is asking for . 
  germany is opposing . 
   the borders would also be much further from where the immigrants come from , namely libya and turkey . 
  eu did n't shrink the borders  - they are as far away as they were . 
  my comment is valid from political point of view as well ( thanks for clarifying ) . 
  how would had the original members solved the migrant issue then ? 
  k , i take it you mention it from moral point of view . 
  morally , you mean common as dictated by germany or common as agreed together ? 
  you sir are mixing schengen with dublin with a pinch of lisbon treaties . 
  and how do you plan on making us accepting them ? 
   also hungary [ suspended dublin in june ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/24/the-boat-is-full-hungary-suspends-eu-asylum-rule-blaming-influx-of-migrants ), 
  would n't mind if fenyman would n't had declared this a month ago : `` barbed wire is not appropriate for receiving people running for their lives '' . 
  google translate :  a compared to the past few days rather average crowds prevailed on tuesday afternoon in the refugee collection centers in pitch and bad radkersburg at the styrian-slovenian border . 
  in pitch were around 1,800 , about 700 people registered in bad radkersburg . 
  at the embankment of the highway border crossing east of collecting barbed band rolls were designed . 
   the continuation of the refugees by bus was made according to the workforces . 
  the situation at the assembly center is quiet and guarantees the supply of those present on site . 
  from slovenia constantly come new refugees at the border . 
  even in bad radkersburg people would constantly brought to the buses provided further in transit camps or towards the north , it was part of the police . 
   am damm the collection point east when federal highway border crossing , on the outskirts of pyhrnautobahn ( a9 ) called sting reels ( sb-rollers ) were postponed . 
  both the highway and the railway embankment - the latter west of the collection - are controlled by police and soldiers . 
  however , recently had people trying to cross the highway to austria . 
  therefore , the existing fences were apparently reinforced before the collection here . 
  i work in sw development . 
  a while ago , one of the finnish managers stated : `` this is not a democracy , from now on all estimates must be accurate '' . 
  ... he failed . 
  great . 
  can poland have a nato base now ? 
  also there are bars with smoking rooms - i remember apollo club in downtown hki has one . 
  yeah , was scratching my head as well . 
  a war between nato members is excluded - 'cause in case of tensions you 'd have us mediation and not merkelism . 
  a war between non-nato with nato is again excluded . 
  nobody will start a war they know they can not win . 
  this leaves us with serbia , montenegro , bosnia and macedonia - hard to believe they want to war again especially over refugees . 
  is there something similar in usa ? 
  if yes , what 's the limit ? 
  i guess smoking in -30 is no fun . 
  also price is sky high in canada afaik + you are in no danger of cheap cigs smuggled across border . 
   sure , the people will leave and go to europe after all these tempting salaries the west is providing . 
  they are providing a house , salaries : freedom . 
  what do you expect from people whose biggest dream before was a trip to lebanon ? 
  now they have a chance to go to europe or sweden . 
  yes , of course they will do it . 
  most of the syrians who have made it are just sitting there doing nothing . 
  they spend their time on facebook and playing cards and in nightclubs with girls . 
  at the end of the month they get money from the government . 
  no comment . 
  here you go : http://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/household-safety/fire/fire-sprinker-system.htm, 
   smoking is also legal in exterior spaces you mean on the street or open terraces ? 
  smoking is forbidden , moreover you have to be at 5 m from entrance ( this part not always respected ) . 
   there are no fire protection systems you can still have heat activated protection also in smoky places . 
  i respectfully disagree with the author . 
  i mean what the actual fuck ? 
  if ** any ** union depends so much on ** any ** politician , that 's not a union anymore but a centrally led colony . 
  how about ep , ec and the myriad of other institutions ? 
  too late ( just like with tv2 ) . 
  i hereby declare my full allegiance to viktor of house orban , king of magyars , first of his name . 
  sorry , i did n't wanted to start a debate on what us should had done/or not , neither the reasons it did something/or not - and i consider your points valid . 
  also glad that you won the cold war btw . 
  was just pointing that your sentence `` this time i think we should leave them to their fate '' is a tad exaggerated , us did left us ( for good reasons probably ) to our fates for most of the century . 
  oh boy , the view is a bit different around here . 
  after ww i , hungary loses 2/3 of the territory and half of the population under patronage of president wilson . 
  during ww ii , in yalta , hungary gets assigned to ussr . 
  thanks for asking where we wan na go , not . 
  in 1956 us watched from the side as russian tanks were killing civilians providing humanitarian help to the refugees ( many thanks ) - would n't exactly call that `` not letting hungary to their fate '' . 
   this time i think we should leave them to their fate huh ?
