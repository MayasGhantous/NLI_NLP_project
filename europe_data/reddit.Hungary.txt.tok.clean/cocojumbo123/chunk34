  german system . 
  you should first define which are the balkan countries , 
  finally moving closer - as someone who does n't own a tv i 'd definitely like that . 
  i wander if they 'll be subtitled or dubbed though . 
   building a fence in the mediterrenian sea ( aka greece ) is not as easy . 
  sea can be also used to our advantage . 
  for example greece could refuse to allow boarding the ferry from islands to mainland for people not qualifying for asylum . 
   they stress that each country that is being crossed has to do their own registration/biometrics probably true ; but one of the reasons we had daily riots were because people refused to be registered . 
  also registration is a different thing than applying for asylum so one can still be registered in greece and apply for asylum in germany . 
  i do n't know how having multiple asylum applications will be handled though . 
   `` refusing entry to third country nationals who do not confirm a wish to apply for international protection '' ( interesting ... ? 
  to be achieved how ? ), 
  from a practical standpoint this is basically what hungary had done . 
  protect the green border with the damn fence and allow ( or not ) entrance only via designated points . 
  it also requested a change in legislation . 
  i guess the intention here is that the destination countries might send back some people to the camps soon to be built . 
  however , i do n't know how much it will work . 
  when hungary was in the front line there have been more than 100 k asylum requests . 
  if i remember correctly 70 k of those were stopped due to disappearance of applicants . 
  sounds like he 's a harry potter fan , 
  there is !, 
  doorstep declarations ( in croatian ) : http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?ref=i110972 loving hug : http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?ref=i110994, 
  the orban just declared he is there just as an observer . 
  i guess , for the lulz : http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?ref=i110983 he also had yet another unorthodox handshake with juncker : http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?ref=i110976, 
  trouble is there are still very few people whom regard europe as an entity . 
  ... and most politicians tend to mend their national interest . 
  this will hopefully change , in time , erasmus is currently our best hope on having home europeanus ( and i know many will disagree ) . 
  i remember an interview with umberto eco and he was saying that we should have erasmus-like programs for jobs , not only students . 
  i support him . 
  honestly , is this big news in holland ? 
  from what i read situations like this are almost daily occurrence in germany . 
   de facto legalization of something that 's illegal by law is harmful . 
  cough . 
  pot ? 
  the article briefly mentions it ( kind of ) :  groups on the far-right spectrum discovered long ago the potential of frustrated people . 
  however , the article fails short on explaining/addressing why people are frustrated . 
  anecdote : two good german friends of mine ( she is a md , he is a nuclear physicist , both phd ) . 
  neither of them is too fond of #willkommenskultur but in private stated `` we ca n't say this in germany '' . 
  honestly , i never heard the term `` polish death camps '' and afaik germany took full responsibility . 
  unrelated : i think the ex-commie countries should advertise more the impact russian ~ ~ occupation ~ ~ love had , especially after ww2 . 
  western people seem to not understand our reticence towards russia .

  while i understand why the anti-countries are dragging their feet , i do n't understand why the pro ones are n't a bit more enthusiastic . 
  sorry for not being clear . 
  mainstream media vs reality was a different paragraph than woman situation ( where i admitted a confirmation bias ) . 
  indeed , mainstream media is not praising woman 's rights and situation in their countries of origin . 
   something we americans actually excel at , but take for granted how do you guys do it ? 
  in many european countries , they get free housing , food , language classes , health care and even vocational training . 
   it just seems like most are only looking at the skin color , the fears i mentioned are irrational ( i.e. 
  not coming from the rational part of our brain ) . 
  in this situation humans will rationalize with whatever argument fits their fear , in many cases this being the skin color . 
   on what sources do you base your perception that migrants see women as lesser feel free to google on the situation of woman in their country of origin . 
   demand changes in local habits because their beliefs might be offended ? 
  anecdotic evidence ( yes , i know that 's confirmation bias working in me ) . 
  also there were the studies that many muslims in europe believe their habits should be above the law . 
  should i google them for you ? 
  it is an evolutionary trait that generally speaking , we are afraid of the unknown - this kept us alive at times when we , humans , were the food . 
  there is also a strong cognitive dissonance between the way mainstream media presents the situation and the reality resulting in people liking the situation less . 
  i ca n't talk about everyone here , personally , i could n't care less about their color or their religion . 
  what i do care about is behavior and habits . 
  for example i do n't want in my country people whom believe woman are a lesser specie or demand changes in local habits because their beliefs might be offended . 
  also there is the ( justified ) fear they 'll not be able to integrate resulting in excessive costs for the social system and ghetoization . 
  ssssss . 
  that was a trick question , 
   and it is irrelevant . 
  could you please explain this : '' the contracting states shall not impose penalties , on account of their illegal entry or presence , on refugees who , coming ** directly ** from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article 1 '' was the life of freedom of `` syrian refugees '' threatened in serbia , slovenia , austria , ukraine or romania ? 
  keyword : ** directly ** . 
  in case of people coming to hungary via turkey we 're talking of people coming through 4 safe countries . 
  still do n't see why i ask on whom neighbors who ? 
  article 2 : general obligations  every refugee has duties to the country in which he finds himself , which require in particular that he conform to its laws and regulations as well as to measures taken for the maintenance of public order . 
  i really do n't know about your country but in mine , when a po tells you `` do n't move '' you do n't friggin move !, 
   and how many are accepted at the border posts ? 
  that is the relevant number here , not the total accepted percentage as that includes people who crossed the border . 
  you contradict yourself . 
  on one hand you say it 's people at border post who matter , on another `` there is no acceptable percentage . 
  people either are refugees , in which case they have to accepted , or they are not , in which case they have to be rejected . '', 
  still no love :( btw : does syria borders saudi arabia ? 
  ( btw : the geneva convention would apply in full there ) . 
   and they are systematically denied within 5 minutes please bother to search for asylum statistics before talking crap . 
  as far as i remember , hungary accepted ~ 10 % of asylum requests . 
  ( btw : cyprus is worse ) . 
  what is the percentage you 'd consider acceptable ? 
   so why would the fact if a state borders another all of sudden be relevant in this case ? 
  please review article 2 and 31 of geneva convention . 
  after you have done so , please come back on how hungarian migration in '56 is the same . 
  i still feel no love :( btw : does greece border syria ????? 
  it 's a frigging ' 3m high , chicken wire fence with 3 rolls of nato standard rolls in front of it , not quite the chinese wall . 
  if 5 000 people would march towards it ( like in yesterday 's video at croatia-slovenia border ) i doubt it 'll last for too long , unless the police goes in heavily . 
  ... and i would n't like that , 
   but at the same time make it impossible for anybody to arrive . 
  anybody can apply for asylum at the official border crossing points , or official asylum applying points . 
  they are marked with arrows !, 
  the fence is against uncontrolled , illegal migration , not legit asylum seekers . 
  do you deny hungary 's right to defend it 's borders ? 
  oh , and btw , i feel no love from you . 
  why do n't you answer to my questions ?
