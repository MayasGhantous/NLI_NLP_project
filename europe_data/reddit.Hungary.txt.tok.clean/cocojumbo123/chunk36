  are german courts based on precedent ? 
  a decision from a court becomes mandatory for similar cases or it 's a case by case ? 
  same here , kind of ; although i do n't know anymore who is left and who is right around here . 
   brain drain not like eu kidnaps them , just saying . 
   or maybe they were drunk bear cost in finland 6 eur . 
  in budapest , ( less than ) 2 eur . 
   this is more about taking them at all a signatory of geneva convention should take any asylum request from persons coming directly from a country where they are persecuted . 
   there is no international treaty that forces them to take them back at all true , unless there are readmission treaties . 
   some kind of permit my head is spinning . 
  how many types of permit do you guys have ? 
   the escape velocity of the food lmao , ok  i guess our stomach is so used to it we do n't feel it anymore . 
   once the levels are sufficiently reduced so that your food only burns when it goes in , and not also when it goes out , it 's actually darn good sir , you 'd been misinformed . 
  there are two types of paprika : sweet and hot . 
  the sweet one does n't burn ( not even on the input channel  it is also used more often - for example for a 10l of gulyas i put 3 spoons of sweet and one spoon of hot . 
  if you editorialize a title the mods will delete it . 
   but then the locals are disadvantaged . 
  and then the extreme right wing will benefit which scares me . 
  jobbik ( our right wing nuts ~ 20 % votes ) already propagated that `` migrants get more/better food than the sick in hospitals '' . 
   germany actually has every right to force all of these refugees back to hungary where they came from . 
  how would mr. orb\u00e1n like that ? 
  hungary so stronk that it borders now syria and afghanistan . 
  soon , hungary can into space as well . 
  take that poland brothers !, 
   that 's a win from germany 's standpoint . 
  hard to say . 
  assuming they do n't get the jobs of locals ( because the locals will be then on benefits ) and that some wo n't engage into criminal activity , yes can be a win . 
   germany never said `` come '' true , germany said `` you are welcome '' . 
  anyway , what germany said does n't really matter . 
  what the rest of the planet understood does  i filtered a g-search of `` refugees welcome germany '' for 08/25 - 09/15 , [ have a look ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=refugees+welcome+germany&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=cdr%3a1%2ccd_min%3a8%2f25%2f2015%2ccd_max%3a9%2f15%2f2015&amp;tbm= ) i find it hard to believe that a politician of merkel 's caliber had no idea how the media will pass the message . 
   one thing to speak about : let 1000ppl . 
  sit in main station and basically just wait till they get hungry , tired or desperate is not my understanding of humane treatment . 
  could you please check the facts ? 
  the people at keleti were requested repeatedly to be relocated to refugee shelters where they had food & stuff . 
  guess what ? 
  they refused !, 
  apparently not so hungry and desperate . 
  the hungarian police could had forcibly remove them ( and send them to camps ) but then that would had been inhuman ... damned if we do and damn if we do n't . 
  also there are reports of people living on streets in germany , waiting to be registered so yeah ... 
  i doubt it 'll stop . 
  large number of migrants are from balkan area - they should know they have virtually no chance of asylum and still coming . 
  and yes , many people will prefer working illegally in germany than legally in hungary . 
  also there were the reports that only 14 % of people whom got their asylum rejected in germany actually left the country . 
  i am not sure i follow . 
  no one said `` no asylum for nobody '' ( at least not that i am aware of ) . 
  here is the current perception around here : - germany tells this people to come . 
  mind you big majority are coming from turkey and not directly fleeing is - germany gets full - germany is generous on other countries behalf - basically germany invited people into hungary & co viktor of house orban is crying about protecting the borders since june btw . 
   means that you wo n't have people illegally traveling through europe why would the inflow stop ? 
   so lets work out a european one . 
  agree . 
  but unfortunately , it looks more like a german one being imposed on the rest of eu . 
  i hope i am wrong . 
  imo we can/should speak about redistribution only after we agreed how to protect our borders . 
  if the uncontrolled inflow is not stopped redistribution is useless . 
   that 's exactly what the dublin convention does wrong . 
  the dublin convention says that the entry country is where the asylum request will be processed . 
  hungary can accept the request or not based on our own laws . 
  however , in the 160 000 redistribution we will receive refugees from elsewhere , their refugee status being decided by a 3 ` rd country . 
  this is not covered by dublin . 
   she 's now proposing a much more fair standard fair for who - germany ? 
  i agree !, 
   people are bitching about how tyrannical she 's being . 
  if the decision would be made the `` old way '' - i.e. 
  our leaders sit in a room and do n't get the fusk out until they all agree it 's fine . 
  if germany is muscling their power to fuck us then please do n't complain on why we do n't enjoy it . 
   this is exactly what is being proposed here . 
  what is the issue ? 
  except that title says `` germany to ** push ** ... '' , no issue . 
  yeah , i felt a shiver of patriotic pride when i learnt they do n't want to stay in austria either . 
  felt a lot better for no reason , 
  airlines have the obligation to return ( on their own money ) anyone denied entry in the destination country . 
   the fact that asylum is considered a human right ... asylum wherever i want is not though . 
  there are also many other issues : there is no agreed list of safe countries . 
  also the asylum procedures differ from country to country . 
  i do n't think it 's fair that a country to be imposed whom to receive based on other country'es laws . 
  do you ? 
  if we 'd have a unified asylum procedure , perfectly fine . 
  but we do n't !, 
  is keeping them under a roof ( with 3 sqm/person ) and food ( which they 'll hate ) humane ? 
   i 'd say they do have an obligation to take them back umm no ? 
  they have an interpretation of the geneva convention where they 'll take only european refugees . 
  and political concessions ... 
  depends on what `` absorb '' means . 
  house them and feed them macaron ? 
  doable . 
  giving every family an apartment and more money than a minimal wage worker does ? 
  not doable . 
  turkey has no obligation to take them back . 
  from my experience finland man very tokative wen drunk . 
  shady pseudo something ( not sure can be called science ) . 
  lem me give you two examples : 1 . 
  when the financial crisis hit , markets were haywire , we had to borrow money from imf ( with the strings attached ) . 
  our government did n't say `` look , if we do n't borrow this money we ca n't pay pensions anymore '' - instead `` we have to cut pensions because imf '' ( btw , this was the pre-orban government ) . 
  every year there is this discussion on `` we 'd love to raise wages for public workers ( doctors , teachers , etc ) '' but eu wo n't let us to go above 3 % budget deficit . 
  respect , germany !, 
  haha , thanks . 
  please remember that around here we are still learning this thing called democracy ( less than 30 years ) . 
  also politicians around here have the habit that whenever they introduce some unpopular measures , they typically blame it on eu/imf . 
  no un treaty saiz that all migrants on planet have to go to sweden and germany though . 
  germany + france + spain + italy are way bigger that ee so it 's normal to have more power .
