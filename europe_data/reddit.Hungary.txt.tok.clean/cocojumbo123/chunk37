  please note that belarus is the happy case . 
  it could have been that romania ends up like moldova . 
  so , you still think eu is evil incarnated and romania would had been better off without it ? 
  dunno , ask the mods . 
  let 's hope she kicks putin , 
  http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=gdp+per+capita+romania+belarus still better :p, 
   belarus made a clear choice too . 
  towards kremlin and it is considerably better off than ukraine or moldova , even under a dictatorship . 
  still way worse than romania under eu : http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=gdp+of+romania+vs+gdp+of+belarus, 
  man , i would really love to see some guidance on what constitutes low quality content for our mods - this thread had 60 upvotes and 40 comments before it got removed :(, 
   and even in the 2000s they demanded privatisation you would have had to do that regardless - how long do you think the inefficient & oversized communist factories would had survived ? 
  also the eu did n't demanded privatization , ( that was most likely imf ) - the eu might had stated that companies receiving help from the state are not allowed to compete on the market . 
  and certainly nobody forced romania to sell their oil companies or bcr . 
  also said privatization started in early '90 - remember the coupon distribution ? 
   massive brain drain , population loss , capital being bought by foreign companies , we completely lost all communist industry in the forced privatisation not to mention a third of a trillion in that period do to coruption , none of this things are due to eu , for example : massive brain drain and population loss are a result of low standards of living in romania and not of eu . 
  loss of communist industry happened in the early '90s . 
  that was ** before ** romania started the talks on joining eu . 
  certainly not . 
  i do n't condone violence or any violent actions as solutions . 
  no need , based on the number of reports in the last days , some locals take care of that themselves . 
   i do n't think a neighbouring county decides about business in your county . 
  when joining the eu all members give up part of their suveranity . 
  also , it 's not ** one ** neighboring country deciding over another but the majority of said union . 
  got it , thanks . 
  on another hand can we agree it was not exactly `` dictatorship '' as op wrote ? 
  and yes , the representative democracy means that some people whom are not elected by me will make decisions for me . 
  it works in all eu at country level ( maybe except switzerland ) , why is so wrong if we apply it at union level ? 
  heck , i did n't voted for orban nor i agree with the decision of redistribution . 
  but it 's hypocritical to cry `` boo , german dictatorship '' whenever there is a decision which i do n't like . 
   voted on by people he did n't and could n't vote on sorry , i do n't understand the meaning of this sentence . 
  who is he ? 
  general comment : can we please stop demonizing germany and merkel ? 
  and holland and finland and france 2 . 
  the relocation decision was voted by everyone except 4 countries . 
  seems quite democratic to me . 
  good 4 . 
  your choice and unfortunately many others will do the same . 
  anyway you refer to noua dreapta ? 
  that 's a decision of your government . 
  stop blaming the eu 6 . 
  agree . 
  what does it has to do with the rest ? 
  merkel promised that germany will support turkey . 
  as head of german government i think she is 200 % entitled to do so . 
  however , the other member stated have all right to reject it ( e.g. 
  cyprus already said they wo n't support ) . 
  agree , how is it connected again with euroscepticism ? 
  we like to see world in black and white . 
  orban was right imo in his approach ( and many hungarians disagree ) but that does n't make him an angel . 
  i respectfully disagree , situation is not exactly comparable . 
  number of migrants sent by hungary to croatia : 0 . 
  number of migrants sent from croatia to hungary more than 100 000 . 
  what rather pissed up some people here were the dick-ish remarks of your pm ( you know , he 's supposed to speak in behalf of the country ) : * day -1 : croatia can handle the migrants in an european manner and without a fence unlike those hungarians ( plan a ) * day 0 : we 're in shit , but we agreed with hungary to send some there * day 1 : we did n't agreed with hungary but we forced 'em to take'em by dumping them at the border ( plan b ) orban is an autoritaristic moron . 
  but at least he is a consistent . 
  edit : anyway , i doubt that average janos bacsi is mad at croatia . 
  there will be a domino effect till greece , where the problem should be addressed imo . 
  seriously , it 's not like is is chasing this guys through serbia . 
   and thats all that matters . 
  yeaaaah , let 's try to keep it this way . 
  slovenia seems to be needing more help right now , but thanks a lot . 
  sure , your proposal might also work . 
  however , from experience , we know how long it takes for eu to put their shit together . 
  heck , i 'd be happy if they can agree on latest proposal : http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-migration/proposal-implementation-package/docs/return_handbook_en.pdf i was talking about something ( less good than yours ) but which can apply immediately . 
   on the other , we 've never has a member of cabinet that stupid fair enough . 
  then i guess it 's fair to call us a nation of liers right ? 
  for example ( from top of my head ) : collin powels lying to un , george w. bush lying to the world , high ranked officials lying wrt to torture in cia prisons and the latest lies wrt afgan hospital bombing . 
  you are partly right . 
  however , germany 's decision to not apply dublin for syrians ( and unfortunately making said decision public ) is one of the major pull factors mentioned in all analysis . 
   i assume hungarian media does n't exactly talk about why the relations are cold or why hungary they do . 
  last one : http://index.hu/gazdasag/2015/10/15/ultimatumot_adott_mol-nak_a_horvat_gazdasagi_miniszter/ however , average hungarian does n't really care who owns ina ...  that must be why you 're under the impression relationships were bad at political level . 
  on another hand the hungarian public had a fairly positive perception on croats and croatia . 
   eliminating pull factor would be to discard dublin ii this is incorrect , quote from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dublin_regulation:  the first member state where finger prints are stored or an asylum claim is lodged is responsible for a person 's asylum claim if germany would be standing by the treaty the pull would be greatly reduced . 
  also , i read somewhere that upon new government in greece they changed the practice of turning the boats back to turkey . 
  if it is too difficult to build a fence it 's probably too difficult for people to cross en masse . 
  also , hungary has a 3 pillar border protection : fence , police + army , legislation . 
  just the fence wo n't be effective alone . 
  do n't generalize please based on some stupid thing someone said ... also , naturally , it is only fair to assume donald trump , tea party , the creationists , racial discrimination are all representative for the whole of us . 
  anyway , did you actually read the article ? 
   spokesperson said the minister 's position `` was just a hypothesis '', 
   hungary has never even pertended to bother to do a serious job of registering the refugees i beg to differ . 
  more than 180 000 applied for asylum in hungary . 
   an extensive history of government lying about statistics you sure you do n't confuse us with greece ? 
  anyway , a source would be nice for such strong statement . 
   tiny bit of extra fence more than 100 km , so yes tiny bit . 
   made huge differences the huge difference was made by croatia not bringing them to hungary anymore . 
  the few which came had to cross croatia or serbia on their own which is much less convenient than hoping on the government provided train/bus . 
   how porous that fence was before that 's why border defense relies on 3 things : fence , police + army , change in legislation . 
   there are still far more people coming in from hungary that is normal , there were still a big bunch in transit through hungary when the border was closed . 
  why ? 
  hungary 's plot [ x-post from / r/polandball ] : http://i.imgur.com/ur66uwr.png, 
  people on / r/europe should not use upvote/downvote as agree/disagree . 
  i mean , you see a parent post downvoted to oblivion and with tens of replies - looks to me it really contributed to the discussion ... 
   only in case that croatia stops accepting them doubt it . 
  they 'll do it as soon as a significant backlog will start building on their territory . 
  that means that if inflow to serbia is higher than the outflow they 'll look for alternatives . 
  already today there were scuffles at the border : http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34567247, 
   austria can not accept any more refugees from slovenia this is discriminatory . 
  what 's wrong with refugees from slovenia ? 
  ( sealed the border just before austria gets full ) . 
  based on previous experience : croatia will keep busing them to the green border .
