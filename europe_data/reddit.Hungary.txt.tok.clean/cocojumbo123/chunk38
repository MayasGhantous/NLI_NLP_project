  ( plan d - like they did with hungary in plan a ) . 
  slovenia will not be able to stop them without police using violence . 
  if croatia manages somehow to slow down the inflow from serbia , serbs will start transporting parts of them to romania . 
  i expect romania to promptly bring them at the hungarian border . 
  do n't know ... some of them were quite tough, 
  quite certain . 
  romanian citizens can enter hungary with their national id . 
  as far as i remember also croatians could ( before they joined eu ) . 
  i said some because i remember only there two  edit : wikipedia to the rescue : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_identity_cards_in_the_european_economic_area  as an alternative to presenting a passport , eea and swiss citizens are entitled to use a valid national identity card as a travel document to exercise their right of free movement in the european economic area and switzerland without a visa . 
  you are exaggerating . 
  turkey joining eu will have to be approved by all the current members . 
  merkel ( as head of government ) can make promises in the name of germany . 
   i would actually like it if they agreed a deal like `` eu membership within x years '' where x is 5 or less years . 
  under current membership rules such promise is not possible - they have to complete the legislation chapters like everyone else . 
  that happened because we were doing our jobs and registering everyone . 
  not in the last month though . 
  also , if i remember well the immigration office stopped the asylum procedure for ~ 70 000 cases due to mysterious disappearance of asylum seekers . 
  was reading that many migrants prefer to be illegal in germany and sweden rather than legal in the poorer eu countries though . 
  nope . 
  some countries can cross with their national ids as explained . 
  anyway , if someone has a romanian id it 's a straightforward process to get a passport as well . 
  poles do n't seem to keen on playing migrant pong . 
  and neither the czechs . 
  hate to say it . 
  but do you remember when v4 said that arguing about the 120,000 was useless unless we stop the inflow ? 
   in comparison to lebanon and turkey , every single eu country offers a better perspective for refugees doubt it  http://www.vice.com/read/afghan-refugees-in-romania-crying-not-hungary-876, 
  no , they just applied plan b. 
  ( plan a apparently was do nothing and hope they wo n't come ) . 
  the interesting bit for me is :  austria told us they can accept at maximum 1,500 austria would n't set such number without consulting with germany . 
  anyway , croatia will be in trouble if this is really true :(, 
   i ca n't see how it benefits slovenia it does n't and it 's a pain in the but so you are right about having the resources part . 
  we had daily riots in hungary in july-august because the migrants did n't wanted to be registered here . 
  the difference between slovenia and the others are that from there they ca go virtually everywhere in schengen ( newly reinstated border controls are a joke ) . 
   however , slovenia is the second schengen country ... well , because the others do n't do their job does n't mean slovenia should n't do it either , does it ? 
   nobody even made an effort to stop it . 
  objection !, 
  we did !, 
  now we 're the new nazi . 
  honestly , after all bashing of hungary ( wrt . 
  european values and humanity , etc ) i really , really , really do n't understand why germany is n't just sending trains and ferries to turkey directly . 
  heck , you could bring everyone by train via bulgaria sparing the dangerous trip over water . 
  considering the current stance of the german government they 'll end up anyway in germany . 
  so why not do the humane thing and spare them a miserable journey ? 
  except that greece registers only ~ 10 % so it 's the next schengen state on the route - croatia - who should do it . 
  the ones upstream do n't have to do it anymore , of course . 
   this exercise is largely pointless i respectfully disagree . 
  i do n't want just about anyone roaming around europe without a minimum of name , age , country of origin and fingerprints . 
  yeah , croatia has one of the most easily defensible borders towards non-schengen ( you did n't miss any country en route , btw , 
   the point is that migration , in general , has ** had ** not has . 
  an american turkey will believe for 364 days that it 's a god and humans are it 's servants   benefits some people , and hurts others , but in these cases , the benefits will always be larger than the negatives objecting to unsubstantiated usage of `` will always ''  on an intuitive level i find it hard to believe that native minimal wage workers will suddenly become stem experts . 
  also , intuitively i believe this works better in countries where there is no minimal wage . 
  what it really boils down to is plus value to the economy . 
  one way to create plus value is to reduce the wages indeed but one should also consider the impact on social security systems ( i.e. 
  increased cost ) . 
  otherwise we are talking on a transfer of value from the state ( integration cost , unemployment benefits ) to corporations ( whom benefit from reduced wages ) . 
  also , economical migration tends to happen towards zones where is a shortage of jobs - for example there are ~ 2 million romanians in italy and spain . 
  they did n't just went all at once but some went , then called home and said `` hey , there are many good jobs in constructions '' , etc. 
   with bill gates , he can pay each person who lost their job $ 500 thousand ( say , through higher taxes aimed at him ) , and he will still have 5 billion dollars left . 
  expecting the studies which show that the rich did n't got richer while the poor got poorer  sure , we can do what you propose , it is just that it 's not really happening . 
  ( idk about uk though ) . 
   eventually , you get to point where you just say you have enough evidence . 
  evidence of what ? 
  that unlimited migration will be beneficial ? 
  because then i will kindly ask you to address ( seriously now ) my 3 billion problem or state a limit . 
  if all they do is transporting then yes , doable . 
  if they want to do a proper job and also register everyone that might be trickier . 
  anyway , the big question is for how long germany can keep their doors wide open ... 
  back with some time . 
  the problem with analogies based on studies is that you can never extrapolate from them . 
  complexity theory clearly shows that in complex systems , same cause can produce different effects for ( even slightly ) different systems but also for the same system in different points in time . 
  so if immigration was good for denmark does n't mean it 'll be good for hungary ( it does n't even mean that if you have another wave incoming in denmark it 'll end up equally good ) . 
  purely from a formal logic perspective is also invalid to say : country x benefited from migration ( or anything else ) therefore country y will benefit as well . 
  ( invalid syllogism ) . 
  the only valid thing from a logical perspective this studies can prove is if someone makes a statement like `` all immigration has negative effects on the economy '' . 
  however , the gazilion studies you link prove only that `` some immigration ** had ** a positive aspect '' and not `` all immigration is good and will have a positive impact '' - as i said , do n't apply the type of inference used in experiments to studies ; they are completely different animals . 
  also the situation is always more complex . 
  while the economy might benefit as a whole the newly created wealth distribution might not be beneficial - bill gates might get 10b richer at the expense of 10k low paying jobs . 
  is this a net plus for society ? 
  - i do n't know , point being that things are always more complex than good or bad . 
  you of ready ? 
  most time is the airline asking for id , but it 's mainly for security purposes ( i.e. 
  to make sure you do n't go on the wrong plane ) . 
  sry , i thought you refer to the article , not the comment : / i do n't have time right now to read all of it but there is a possibility your arguments use [ hasty generalization ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/hasty_generalization ) though . 
   one thing people sometimes do for fun is extend a useful analogy or metaphor to the point of absurdity . 
  i do n't mock , i use the same argument in a manner explained in the link :p anyway , we will soon see if this analogy is fine or not by following the socio-economical situation of sweden ( welcoming culture , relatively large number of migrants/capita ) . 
  also the countries holding the largest number of reffugees ( turkey , lebanon , etc ) do n't seem to exhibit this great benefits so far . 
  edit : no offence but your last line with the evidence is also proof by analogy since it covers eu migrants , 
  the article makes a parallel between hungarian migration in '56 and the current situation . 
  it concludes based on a logical fallacy that the current migrants can be as successful . 
  usage of logical fallacies to make a point results in invalid logic . 
  to give you an example , by using the very same analogy i could argue that fine , let 's invite into europe the 3 billion people on the planet living in poverty because that 'll mean amazing economic advances and cultural enrichment . 
  http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/argument_from_analogy  an argument from analogy uses an analogy ( comparing objects or ideas with similar characteristics ) to support an argument . 
   a false analogy , weak analogy , or appeal to analogy is a logical fallacy that makes a conclusion that is not supported by the analogy due , for various reasons . 
  [ 1 ] sometimes these differences are outright ignored by the person presenting the fallacy ; other times , they may not be aware of the differences or that they apply . 
  the fallacy occurs , and is common , because analogies are just that , analogies , and their parallels are always limited ; the differences between things can often overpower their similarities . 
  one thing people sometimes do for fun is extend a useful analogy or metaphor to the point of absurdity . 
   analogies and metaphors can be very useful to explain things to people and often play an important part in learning . 
  however , because of the prevalence of false analogies they 're much less useful in making arguments . 
  * a man got ta do what a man got ta do ... 
   although at first i read that as `` istv\u00e1n a kir\u00e1ly +1 i hoped someone will get it   i just get tired of repeating these points .
