  not an article per se but the latest eurostat report : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/migration_and_migrant_population_statistics, 
  true , but that does n't mean we have n't done our fair part to try to manage the situation . 
  thanks , it 's clear now . 
  is there an onu resolution ( either plenary or security council ) against assad ? 
  - to my knowledge , he is still the legal representative of his country . 
  i said asylum requests , not accepted requests like your link says . 
  eurostat , check column before last : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/2/27/asylum_applicants_%28including_first_time_asylum_applicants%29%2c_q2_2014_%e2%80%93_q2_2015.png, 
  there are already reports that half of people entering sweden do n't bother to register . 
  also , if i remember correctly only 10 % of people deported from germany bother living . 
  so it seems it is worth it living in rich countries even without any benefits . 
  i guess they still have access to health care and schools for kids ) . 
   every syrian that is affected by the war and gets to the eu will be allowed to stay , no matter where he touches eu soil . 
  this is due to the european convention on human rights and article 33 of the geneva refugee convention . 
  you sure ? 
  i thought geneva convention applies to people fleeing persecution not war . 
   somehow hungary ... what ???? 
  hungary has the highest proportion of asylum requests per capita . 
  ( i did n't downvoted you so ca n't relly reply why some people go against rediquette ) . 
   that is also why you need quotas for every country this is also why you need a harmonized benefit system ( as / u/fluchtpunkt mentioned ) so that benefits are equally good ( or bad ) everywhere . 
  otherwise they will not stay in the allocated countries . 
  right now russia 's gdp is on par with spain for example . 
  i have emotional ( no proof ) confidence that poland will do better than that . 
  so , a high gdp per capita and an awareness that one must be wary of the big eastern neighbor . 
  nope , [ paris syndrome ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paris_syndrome ), 
  `` our job is to report the news , not fabricate it . 
  that 's the government 's job . '', 
  - v for vendetta guess this applies for all sides . 
  sry to say but my sides ... one would think this people should be grateful for being safe from is and hungarians ... edit : forgot austria in between . 
  if the situation goes on like this in 20 years poland will be on par with russia ( except for the nukes ) imho . 
  most probably it can reduce the level of coolness for first time smokers so less people will start smoking . 
  as a heavy smoker i do n't give a damn how is packaged though . 
  i thought it is allowed to open the can only outside . 
  relevant : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_haw_ydc_zo, 
   even notoriously geographically ignorant americans yes , but they know santa is coming from around there so it must be cold , 
  but german to english is kinda bad . 
   german efforts to push for securing greek waters with european forces ... 
  i 'm actually surprised on how little flack greece got on this one , you are right with the sovereignty part . 
   also , what makes you think we do n't support unhcr camps ? 
  sorry , what i meant was that we do n't support them enough . 
  for example there were some reports today on people leaving jordan back to syria because the food allowance was cut . 
   you think that a selfie with a refugee is an invitation or even a reason for anyone to start the trip to europe ? 
  that makes no sense . 
  what you and i think is irrelevant . 
  what matters is how it was perceived . 
  what do you think those guys read ? 
  the press releases of the german government ( in german ) or the headlines in the international media ? 
  also could you please explain why everyone can be free only in germany and sweden ? 
   we ca n't stop the influx of refugees yes we can - by better protecting our external borders ( nb . 
  that 'll not stop the inflow but greatly reduce it ) and support the unhcr camps - like norway does . 
   do n't have to take anyone back . 
  agree , those who are inn have to be processed here . 
   so what 's your solution ? 
  shoot the refugees ? 
  absolutely not !, 
  see above . 
   sink their boats/ships ? 
  turn them back for example ? 
  this is what was done in greece before syriza . 
   no , there were n't at least until short ago ( i do n't know the current situation ) . 
  the places were opened the second the illegal border crossing was closed . 
  also anyone can claim asylum at the legal border crossing . 
  trouble is that almost noone wanted to claim asylum in hungary ( or austria ) . 
   and the razor wire fence is awful agree . 
   and useless . 
  disagree . 
  also tell this to us , uk , france , spain and bulgaria ( in no particular order ) . 
   it 's only is another sign of countries pushing around refugees between each other inside europe and nobody liking really to address and solve the common problem together this is incorrect . 
  our huge leader orban the 1 ` st is quoted saying `` if the pipe is broken , you should n't argue how much water you move into the living room '' . 
   every country telling , but we do n't want them , is of no use at all . 
  they wo n't disappear . 
  fully agree , but if you remember at end of aug-early sept all germany was talking ( on the record at least ) was `` how to distribute the 40 - 80 -120 k '' . 
  it is only now that discussions start to happen . 
  i 'm all fine with that but then do n't blast us with `` muh solidarity '' and `` fair share '' . 
  instead of this hypocrisy just say it loud : `` do it because we outvoted you and you signed the dang treaty '' . 
  i did n't actually expected a reply : thanks for that !, 
  i 'll try to answer with the hungarian position . 
   coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened not really the case as you also mention . 
  also there is the paragraph describing that refugees have to respect the laws of the country they are in . 
  i disagree though with your interpretation of eu charter - there is quite a leap between right to life and dignity and `` i can be free only in germany '' mentality . 
  also until the refugee status is granted they are migrants . 
  also , there are gazilion treaties basically granting any country on the planet the right to accept or reject whomever they want at the border . 
  ( and yes , they can not reject someone claiming asylum ) . 
  wrt the dang fence : at hungarian-serbian border there are places where anyone can claim asylum . 
   also germany is n't that rich as far as i can remember germany spent ~ 5 billion so far without breaking a sweat . 
  ee countries would be in deep poo if they 'd need to find even 10-20 % of that . 
   this is pure bs . 
  germany never invited anyone then at least ask merkel to stop posting selfies with migrants as a first step ? 
   it 's despicable how the eastern europeans simply ignore their share it is equally despicable how germany tries to push the share down our throats . 
  why there is 0 pressure on uk for example ? 
   we simply ca n't stop the influx of refugees i disagree . 
   because it violates the genever convention on the right of refugees as well as the european human rights charter which articles ? 
  us has a big ass fence also ... just saying . 
  apparently # 1 and # 3 were forgotten then ... 
  btw , your ctrl ^ c ctrl ^ v is broken - op said `` excellent analysis '' , you got `` excellent journalism '' . 
  must be the auto-correct / s /, 
  care to explain ? 
  - which prediction you disagree with ? 
   * in europe , the process of integrating foreigners will remain problematic , especially because migrant workers tend to have fewer job opportunities than their native peers . 
   * right-wing parties and groups will continue to resist arriving foreigners , attack migrant shelters and protest immigration policies . 
   * although immigration can somewhat mitigate the effects of a shrinking and aging population , it can not reverse it , nor will all eu members attract foreigners to join their workforces .
