  also for / u/steppdeckenwolf - this gives a more accurate picture : https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2015/hungary ; 2010 is the year orban come back in power, 
  also for / u/pepperboon you are both right . 
  from a legal framework perspective the media is quite free and there are plenty of anti-orban outlets - one worrying thing is some attempts to limit requests under freedom of information or hiding the spending of national bank - but this are not attempts to curb media freedom . 
  on the other side , orban tries to manipulate the media via means of public advertising ( and in a small market as hungary that 's a big chunk ) or by supporting his friends into buying media outlets . 
  also radio frequency allocation is dodgy at times . 
  a shitload of money was sunk into the public media but nobody watches that . 
  wrt # 67 , italy is lower - still you do n't hear calls to kick it out . 
  edit : tl ; dr wrt media - things got a bit worse under orban but not to the catastrophic level sometimes described . 
   orban 's party holds a supermajority in parliament not in this electoral cycle actually . 
  i 'm officially dumb - he said that indeed - thanks . 
  do n't forget calais or spanish border with morocco ( where people are actually shot at ) . 
   'm not sure it really works that way since the question is n't in relation . 
  orban is a very polarizing figure - people who do n't vote for him , generally speaking , hate him . 
  according to the poll i sent you , bottom 3 rows mean kind of dislike eu ( grey ) , strongly dislike ( yellow ) and do n't know ( light blue ) . 
  that gives a total of 19 % who dislike eu . 
  if i add up the opposition support i end up with 34 % . 
  i did n't included people who wo n't vote or undecided although a part of them will hate orban for sure . 
  so yeah , i 'd say more people dislike orban than they dislike eu . 
  man , you have a weird definition of fascism ... 
  ouch , i interpreted as hungarians hating eu more under orban ( which is not true ) . 
  there is no poll on `` do you hate orban ? '', 
  lol . 
  his party trends at around 30 % of total population . 
  https://drive.google.com/file/d/0bzaoumhhqnv-whnzvzvsale0dja/view?pageid=110578652249252312493 [ pdf ]  you 're welcome to prove me wrong . 
  slide 2 , blue is very supportive , yellow is rather supportive . 
  yes , but in the region , nationalism ( 1848 revolutions ) were a reaction against said imperialism . 
   authoritarian does n't mean unpopular . 
  you are correct , i meant he does n't really need to be authoritarian in this aspect . 
  for the rest : it half true , half debatable imo - especially during first mandate when he had 2/3-rd of the seats in parliament . 
   he should have said authoritarianism , that makes sense - i just did n't understood what austria , russia and the romanian nationalists have in common . 
  anyway , wrt refugee crisis i would n't call orban authoritarian as the population approves of his stance with a 70 + rate . 
  sorry , but what does imperialism has to do with left or right ? 
   has nothing to do with having spine telling no to germany requires some spine imo . 
  i do n't remember any other hungarian pm to have done so , but i can be wrong . 
   where orban got in power with his relatively extreme conservative views actually he got in power due to utter incompetence of previous government + crisis of 2008 . 
  there was virtually no debate . 
  no decision yet to my knowledge, 
  could be , although as far as i can remember he did n't go publicly too often against merkel . 
  he 's blasting the commission with every opportunity though . 
  at those times he was just making excuses because everyone was freaking out on how russia will react ( we still had russian military bases here ) - but yes , you can say that was ahead of his times . 
   i expect that you will find that this phrase is about immigration and not any policy for the domestic public that is correct . 
  on another hand i have no idea what orban means by `` counter revolution '' nor i saw a concrete proposal on what `` less commission '' means . 
  that is actually really funny . 
  thanks . 
  i am aware of the numbers - but i never read of apartheid like conditions where people were n't allowed to move ( aside for earlier times of serfdom - but that applied to all serfs regardless of nationality ) . 
  also romanians had quite some top intellectuals in transylvania at that time . 
  ( e.g. 
  transylvania school ) - how would that be possible under apartheid like conditions . 
  you do n't need to answer tonight - internet we 'll be here tomorrow as well , 
   the majority of population was forbidden to even move to cities . 
  do you have a source on that ? 
  ( i can g-read romanian also if needed ) . 
   but let 's say lots of other people did similar stuff during that period . 
  that was my point actually - i am mildly annoyed when either romanians or hungarians present themselves as innocent angels whereas the other side is ohsobad . 
  i am well aware of the shit we did in ww2 ( ip , trasnea , moisei , etc ) and i hope you are also aware of the maniu guards ( e.g. 
  : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gavril_olteanu ) full report ( long , pdf ) : http://www.hungarianhistory.com/lib/feher/feher.pdf wrt horea & co - that is marked as an anti-nobles revolt not as an anti-hungarian one . 
  if my memories are correct , the decision to open the border was in 9/10 but the effective opening happened in 9/11 . 
  which time period ? 
  oh , you little angel : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanianization, 
   the key , he says , is an acknowledgment that this stance is not a democratic decision , but an imposition . 
  yes , but then the right wing will win for sure since they will promise to represent the will of the people . 
  the two tailed dog party also made high res posters available so that anyone can print them . 
  clever . 
  he would be kind of right only if we assume that all of the higher cost in us actually goes into research and innovation .

  you did n't really answer the moral part - you ca n't / it 's hard to legislate people into being moral . 
  yeah , michelangeo 's david would be ok , titian 's [ venus of urbino ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/venus_of_urbino#/media/file:tiziano_-_venere_di_urbino_-_google_art_project.jpg ) no . 
  heck , probably da vinci 's [ sistine chapel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sistine_chapel_ceiling#/media/file:michelangelo_-_creation_of_adam.jpg ) would get banned for showing adam 's ( small ) dick . 
  sorry for writing a second reply - i have more time now . 
  there are two aspects : moral and legal . 
  from a legal perspective , you are probably correct - fb can do as it pleases - although it might get challenged in courts in europe - and i certainly hope it will . 
  i 'm not buying into `` if people are unhappy '' they are free to not use fb . 
  fb is the the facto social network - a monopoly if you wish . 
  because when you say `` you '' - that means in practice `` you and all your friends '' . 
  i 'd be perfectly fine if a court forces fb to open up their interfaces so that i can use a competitor while retaining access to my friends but sadly this is not the case . 
  from a moral perspective we 're entering murky waters . 
  the pic they are censoring is credited of being one of the most powerful images ever and with having a huge impact over changing of american sentiment wrt the vietnam war . 
  so , if vietnam war would be today many people would never see this pic . 
  but let 's take another example : corporations are people , right ? 
  what if monopolies like google or facebook start to actively intervene in the results of us election ( or any other one ) - by actively censoring news . 
  would that be ok ? 
  last but not least in the difference legality vs morality , fb has to comply to requests from oppressive regimes in identifying `` dangerous '' people . 
  legal ( from that country perspective : yes ) , moral ? 
  you do n't get everything your friends likes ( unless you have very few of them ) - so facebook does some selection . 
   facebook filtered users ' news feeds -- the flow of comments , videos , pictures and web links posted by other people in their social network . 
  one test reduced users ' exposure to their friends ' `` positive emotional content '' , resulting in fewer positive posts of their own . 
  another test reduced exposure to `` negative emotional content '' and the opposite happened .

  prague , budapest , krakow , talin , some big city in italy, 
  by having the algorithm deciding which stories go into your stream . 
   facebook lost a crucial legal battle friday as a paris court ruled the social network can be sued in france over its decision to remove the account of a french user who posted a photo of a famous 19th-century nude painting . 
   no one is compelled to use fb by law . 
  but fb might be compelled to respect the laws of the countries where it operates : http://mashable.com/2016/02/12/french-court-facebook-nude-painting/#4nk4fv1n2mqx ( nsfw ), 
   fb is a private company , not the un . 
  so censorship is ok if done by private corporations ? 
  mr. dictator , sir : how about we outsource to private corporations all the state censorship - that 's absolutely o.k. 
  that 's also what the editor of the newspaper also wrote in a very powerful way : http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/kommentar/dear-mark-i-am-writing-this-to-inform-you-that-i-shall-not-comply-with-your-requirement-to-remove-this-picture-604156b.html, 
  i might be oversensitive but to me this looks like fb is showing the middle finger to the nation of norway . 
  was n't it so that germany suspended dublin ? 
  i was thinking in general like in the nipplegate , not necessarily about this photo .
