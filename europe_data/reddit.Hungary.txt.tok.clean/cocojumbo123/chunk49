  you are a bit unfair ...  hungary constantly lets the refugees from their country seep into austria unopposed no country on route is defending the exit path - or why was n't germany stopping migrants from going to sweden via denmark . 
  we can not put them in closed camps which is illegal under guidance from ec . 
   and then categorically refuses to take them back even though they let them come originally tell that to greece , we 're not the first point of entry to eu/schengen !, 
   roughly 30 a day that come in through hungary still according to austrian police anyway , you are probably right we shall tear down the fence and ferry 10k/day like last year to show the world our humanity . 
  so being part of the union means do what germany says - if i understand correctly - or face punishment ? 
  because this is what your attitude conveys . 
  also please start punishing asap the 22 countries who promised they 'll take 160k people and managed to take a grand total of 3k so far . 
  sure do : now as a starting point have all german businesses operating in services here relocate to syria as well ( lidl , aldi , reifeissen ) , etc. 
  i 'm sick and tired of hearing of altruism of we towards ee - like we 're the only ones benefiting from eu . 
  for the 5b eur or so we receive/year german economy benefits much more . 
  so if ad absurdum such ban would happen in today 's saudi arabia would that be ok ? 
  you should maybe ask turkey about it - why ataturk banned traditional clothing in his quest for secularization . 
  fun thing was that he meant illiberalism as `` state controlling some assets '' - that was before refugee crisis when hungary was buying back some banks , gas storage , etc. 
  there was the famous orban speach on illiberalism ( completely taken out of the context ) where he gave examples of illiberal countries doing fine , turkey among them ( and russia - doing fine at that time , and singapore ) . 
   one of the strongest arguments for multiculturalism is the synergic collaboration between people from various backgrounds do you have a source for this claim ? 
  because , again , i have sources claiming that in white collar/creative ** teams ** physical based diversity has no impact on team productivity . 
  as i said , having a cross functional team is much more productive . 
  nb : still , even if what i say might work for a team it 's no guarantee it 'll work for a nation !, 
  if anything , if i look around of `` welcome migrants '' nations , sorry , i do n't see a happy pattern !, 
  and now you come and claim it at a society level ? 
  sorry , i still fail to see how a cannibal culture ( yes , i am going extreme - because any theory is best tested at extremes ) will enrich me . 
   a more down-to-earth example of this would be brain drain brain drain means get the brightest ; in your opinion is is ok to allow one million migrants while knowing that 100 of then will commit terror attacks whereas one will get the nobel ? 
   successfully implemented multiculturalism leads to more peace through building up consideration for other people and cultures and through the natural humbling effect it has on people because of sheer exposure do you have a source except for pulling it from your ass ? 
  because in the studies i read diversity reduces social cohesion !, 
  you know - what i said , lefties , preaching diversity for `` reasons '' ... do n't get me wrong , i am not saying that one is good and the other bad - but the drawbacks are clear , the benefits are murky !, 
  fml , i reread your answer ( half sober ) and i still ca n't disagree - in group , out group - check ; no sorry ass simplistic theory , check !, 
  gg sir ; i wish i had 1000 upvotes - i hope you 'll post that somewhere else on reddit and it wo n't be just a lvl 4 reply in a rando thread . 
  there are no consequences of letting that girl pregnant . 
  assuming the baby is born if you do n't do your fatherly duties will probably go to jail . 
  you did n't actually answered my question ( but excellent answer , btw - did n't expected this from you ) . 
  were you exposed to people claiming marrying 12 year old girls is ok ? 
  or that polygamy is ok ? 
  not really . 
  our left has much less media than the government . 
  also while hardcore fidesz fans would call the socialists `` dirty commies '' , the socialists are definitely not descendants of the soviet revolutions . 
  the reason i put left in `` quotas '' is the following : traditionally , left represents the interests of working class people - nowadays some left parties went full meta/retarded ; like some german greens which allegedly claimed `` there is no german culture '' , etc. 
  my personal opinion is that people advertising multikuli never experienced it actually . 
  most of the time , we 're talking of highly educated intellectuals which interacted only with other highly educated intellectuals from different cultures . 
  but between highly educated people the cultural differences are minimal regardless of where they come from !, 
  so , again , my personal opinion is that they fall into the trap of generalizing - i.e. 
  exactly the same sin they accuse people claiming `` all members of religion x are behaving in a certain way '' . 
  edit : nb : i am in the business of building effective teams and let me tell you that diversity based on physical appearances ( i.e. 
  gender/skin color ) are having small impact in terms of team productivity , whereas diversity based on roles ( marketing , sales , etc ) in the same team ( i.e. 
  diversity of opinion ) are much more beneficial . 
  we used to be multicultural until end of ww1 . 
  then wilson doctrine of mono-ethnic countries is pushed on us as the way to go . 
  now someone ( `` the left ? '' ), 
  - postulates with exactly zero proof that multi-kulti is good for ... reasons - but i never saw a logical reason except for food . 
  and i can have excellent thai/italian restaurants in hungary without a mandatory quota of thais and italians so even food is a bad example of benefit . 
  also ee countries are multicultural : slovakia , romania and ukraine have some hungarian minorities for example , not to speak of gypsies which are also present ; heck even for a small country as hungary there are cultural differences between the capital and a small village . 
  edit : i realize my comment is not exactly an answer to your good post - just ramblings through my brain after reading it . 
   if they want to have the fom to other ** eu countries ** , then they too should accept fom [ my interpretation : ** from anywhere ** ] into their country . 
  spot the fallacy ... 
   so , this guy wants legal slovakian citizens who were born and lived their whole lives in the country to be treated as illegal immigrants/refugees just because they 're not likable ? 
  i do n't think that 's what he meant . 
  more like mandatory sharing of `` burden '' . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4y06st/why_slovakia_wont_embrace_migration/ ... already posted , sorry, 
   of course it 's about discouraging certain behaviours but in the same time they do encourage those same behaviours . 
  you mean their angry male relatives harpooning locals ? 
  you would n't go in a swimming suit to a funeral right ? 
  if the vague thing called social rules gets broken it ** might ** be ok for the authority to impose formal rules to preserve social peace . 
  this has nothing to do with woman 's rights or religion . 
   i do that too , sometimes ( it 's a horrible thing though ) . 
  this means it 's too cold in the sauna - no kidding . 
  i used to go in hungary at temps of 70 max and it was n't too god - i tried in finland the real thing 90 + and it 's much better . 
  the point is not about clothing but about discouraging certain behaviors typically associated . 
  for smokers it 's trowing cigs in the sand ( i always collect mine ) ; in this particular case , well , we saw the results . 
  you can not go fully clothed into a finnish public sauna for example . 
  you can not smoke or drink on some beaches in us . 
  ( i did n't downvote btw ) . 
  then should n't one of them be reinstated ? 
  @mods : here 's a silly thought - could we have this picture in the header for a week or so ? 
  i heard an anecdote of a very white and naturally blonde algerian guy who went to study in us - before going there , he registered to the `` african-american '' student association on the logic `` i am african and i live in america '' , 
   which is why the dm story is still on the frontpage with thousands of upvotes . 
  / r/europe has decided its narrative , do n't be so harsh - anything with over 2-300 votes in a short time will be picked in the front page for / r/all so many of those votes will come from people who do n't visit here . 
   now who is dragging their feet and not actually wanting to do what the dublin system demands ? 
  hungary is not the entry point into eu , you know ... 
  the government decides which specialties are more needed and grants a certain number of free seats . 
  if you want to do an non state supported specialty ( if i remember right law is one of them  or your entry scores are not high enough for the other you 'll have to pay . 
  the tower behind is higher , 
   what is hungary 's productivity growth , 2 % afaik ( could be wrong ) macroeconomic productivity is defined as #hours worked / 1 eur in gdp - so having some sectors which will need salary adjustments is not necessarily bad . 
  wrt where to bring people from ( assuming is really needed ) there was some talk but no conclusion other than `` from countries culturally compatible '' or something . 
  yup , that 's exactly what our foreign minister just declared - i mean wrt the first eu country , not the siesta part . 
  page not found for me, 
  i hope that is because it was already posted : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4wk6ui/deadly_macedonia_storms_floods_kill_15_in_skopje/, 
  certainly not you , i would had remembered that  unrelated : i remember we discussed a while ago about corruption everywhere - there is [ this ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/4rfq5e/how_hondurans_shower/d514av3 ) great comment found via / r/bestof on the differences . 
  i 'd say hungary is lvl 2.5 , whereas newer coming in the eu ( e.g. 
  romania , bulgaria ) are two-ish . 
  also for / u / _ paxter _ , i guess you guys can understand this better than me : http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article156145936/blockade-der-balkanroute-war-wirksamer-als-der-tuerkei-deal.html, 
  9 months ago i was ridiculed on this very sub for fear-mongering with the argument is can afford a frigging fake passport and a plain ticket , no need to risk ... by people with german flag . 
  lmao . 
  wandering who is the capital of `` moderate racism '' then ... 
  happy v-day neighbors !, 
  i think you would have more success if you 'd post this in the national subs of the countries - hint : use the map in the upper right corner and the dots . 
  cg and coding yes , i do n't know about gamedev . 
  stop anthropomorphizing animals - at least big-j talked of humans . 
  also : `` every moving thing that lives shall be food for you . 
  and as i gave you the green plants , i give you everything . '',

   the human body is meant to live off vegetarian food .
