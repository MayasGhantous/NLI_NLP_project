  no it 's not !, 
  the reason we have humans living pretty much everywhere on the planet is that we can eat almost everything . 
  any dental study will tell you we 're omnivorous . 
  any sane dietetician will tell you we need a balanced approach ( yes , including meat ) . 
  i agree - although it looks like parent rather wants to impose his morals onto others . 
   it is a moral duty of human beings to not kill . 
  [ animals ] says who and since when ? 
  do n't worry , we 'll never let poland down . 
   i do n't consider a real threat that russia will attack any nato member . 
  but at the same time i respect that others have different opinions . 
   baltics and poland have different opinions and we respect that . 
  i ca n't think with their heads , i am not a pole and i do n't live in poland . 
   the hungarians and the romanians will want their territories back . 
  err , nope - majority of hungarians in hungary would n't even want transylvania back - for economic reasons . 
  why i posted this : in a divided europe , the extreme right claims that all muslims are terrorists ( which is dumb given that on a global scale muslim victims outnumber non-muslim ones at least 10 to 1 ) and the left claims it has nothing to do with religion ( which is equally dumb ) - we must have a dialogue in the middle !, 
  unless we can bring this conversation to the middle , the extreme right will keep winning over the silent majority which is constantly told `` shut up '' ( or something ending with phobia ) by the current `` progressive '' `` elites '' . 
  wow . 
  so a company acting according to the law is now a target due to respecting the law ? 
  wtf is wrong with those people ? 
  drink it 3 . 
  ( next day ) err , what was it that i shall buy ? 
  oh , yes !, 
  simple question : can a journalist/newspaper/tv station be anti-erdogan without fear of being arrested as a gulenist ? 
  yup , saw two of those today on the way to farmer 's market . 
   payroll taxes , social security but this are state institutions , are n't they ? 
  i understand that an employer might get fooled by fake papers , but the state institutions ? 
  one thing i do n't understand is how could they pay taxes if they are illegally ? 
  at least in my country , you ca n't get hired if you do n't have some id ( yes i know , uk does n't have national ids but i bet there are ways to prove if someone is legal or not ) . 
   you mean , that does n't exist in europe ? 
  nope , at least not in hungary or romania and from what i understand from / u/fluchtpunkt neither in germany . 
  agree !, 
  what can i say , watch and cry - prices for digi internet in hungary ( with 2 year contract ; 1 eur ~ 315 huf ) : http://digi.hu/ajanlat/internet/lan, 
  as i said , same logic as with electricity providers . 
   it 's a shitty idea if you want new technologies in a country wide scale i was talking of cable operators - hardly anything new will come in that field . 
  the innovations are happening in the core network e.g. 
  how much can we increase the capacity of existing infrastructure . 
   because the company does n't have any investment risks . 
  good point . 
  well , they could get some grace period during which they do n't need to share their infrastructure . 
  i 'd be with you if i would n't know cable operators are making obscene profits . 
  how do i know that ? 
  by looking at pricing from incumbents like google fiber or romania 's digi ( btw : they are largely responsible for putting romania on any top of internet speed ), 
  in addition to this , what i would like is to oblige cable operators to allow other operators in using their infrastructure against a regulated connection fee . 
  something akin what electricity providers do . 
  when i had my second provider in my building the price went down 60 % and the bandwidth doubled . 
  i said a big chunk of ee people moving to richer country are not so educated . 
  usually they work for close to minimal wage or are unemployed . 
  now a minimal wage in uk is way better than a minimal wage in ee . 
  yeah ... no ; vast majority are uneducated and maybe not so young . 
  or do you think phds in gender studies are working in constructions and what not ? 
   free movement does not work when there is such a colosal disparity in living standards between member states . 
  free movement is attenuating the disparity . 
  and imo it works quite well . 
  this could be the opening scene to some very kinky german porn movie ... 
   eu 's migration policy is a deadly poison and we do n't want to take it . 
  that is true . 
  http://www.hirado.hu/2016/07/26/orban-magyarorszag-mindent-megtesz-hogy-a-leheto-legjobb-szomszedja-legyen-ausztrianak/ feel free to listen to the original - question starts at 31:55 . 
  orban is bashing brussels and their policies starting at 34:50, 
  number of people caught ilegaly crossing the serbian-hungarian border in the last 30 days : http://police.hu/hirek-es-informaciok/hatarinfo/elfogott-migransok-szama note : on 07.05 a new law came into effect . 
  consequently , anyone caught within 8km from the border is escorted back to the fence and told to wait their turn . 
  this people are therefore not represented in this statistic . 
  hah , found the comment as well - looks like someone copy-pasted indeed . 
  well , it 's in the article itself - not exactly sherlock level find , 
  refugees obviously ; orban refers to them as migrants . 
  say , do you agree the article is an accurate description of what he actually said/meant ? 
  because to me it looks like a quote terribly out of context which was further editorialized . 
   hungary does n't need immigration he was speaking about some alleged plans and papers from ec claiming that the current migration wave can be beneficial to fix demographics and lack of workers . 
  in this context he said that hungary prefers to solve it 's problems differently and we do n't need this type of solution . 
  he was specifically speaking about the people currently waiting at the serbian border :  mr orb\u00e1n pointed out in answer to another question : there are civil society organisations working in hungary also at present , and the government supports them so that they can do their job well . 
  however , the problems are not in the territory of hungary , and not on the hungarian side of the hungarian-serbian border . 
  it is in serbia where the assistance of non-governmental organisations would be truly required where there are at present some 600-1 ,000 people waiting to be allowed into hungary , he said . 
   he stressed : the essence of \u201e the hungarian entry policy '' lies in only allowing in as many people as the authorities are able to check . 
  based on the hungarian approach , \u201e each and every migrant poses a public security and terrorist threat '' , and it takes a long time -- several months -- to determine the extent of the risk or whether the risk exists at all , he explained . 
  here : http://www.kormany.hu/en/the-prime-minister/news/austrian-border-can-be-best-protected-at-hungarian-serbian-border this is not complete but close enough . 
  he was answering a question wrt people currently waiting in serbia to be allowed into hungary and how hungary allows so few because it considers every single one of them a security risk ; therefore they have to be vetted properly which takes time . 
  title :  ... ** migrants ** are ` poison ' and ` not needed ' what ~ ~ the moron ~ ~ orban actually said :  for us ** migration ** is not a solution but a problem ... not medicine but a poison , we do n't need it and wo n't swallow it edit : removed `` moron '' - i just spent 40 minutes listening to the press conference ; the quote is horribly out of context . 
  germany did had a choice !, 
  now excuse me if your politicians made you think you did n't . 
  again , you welcome them - you keep them !, 
   and what do you think would have happened had we closed the borders , like you ? 
   that 's your solution ? 
  domino effect obviously !, 
  we do n't need to talk hypothetically - it happened already . 
  if germany would had given a strong signal in august 2015 , you guys would have 500k migrants less . 
  it had to be small shitty countries like hungary and macedonia to take the crap for the balkan stream to stop !, 
   ... they moved around you are conveniently ignoring the fantastic pull factor of `` we 're welcome in germany '' that you yourselves created !, 
  as we speak there are 3000 migrants at the hungarian borders . 
  all of them wanting to go to germany . 
  do you think the serbs ( or greeks ) are killing them or something ? 
   but the hungary-model was never a politically viable alternative . 
  the hungarian model was never discussed because merkel chose to bulldozer her way through . 
  edit : do n't get me wrong , i believe merkel is the most capable of navigating eu27 out of brexit . 
  let me tell you one secret : the reason greece , serbia , hungary/croatia , austria passed all those people to you is : you allowed it !, 
   can we ? 
  is n't it so that the german law would n't grant asylum to someone coming from a safe country ? 
  ergo : could you or would you ? 
  btw : do you still have the `` refugees welcome '' crowds ? 
  thought so !, 
  do n't get me wrong - germany decided to climb on a really high moral horse . 
  we did n't !,
