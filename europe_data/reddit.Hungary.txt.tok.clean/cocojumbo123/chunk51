  now please accept the consequences . 
  meanwhile , we 'll keep defending schengen borders while taking crap from the very same people we are defending ... 
   i 'm not barking at any tree , i 'm simply sick of hearing ... 
  please accept my apologies - i got a very wrong impression/interpretation . 
  you could copy hungary - not rocket science - but averyone knows you wo n't . 
  at least not yet !, 
  unrelated : there was this great article posted today ( long read ) : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4uhiiq/when_and_why_nationalism_beats_globalism/, 
  kind reminder that we are basically defending your borders . 
   because their border is also the schengen yes , mr. german - and we keep the rules by the letter !, 
   and hungary let them through as per any human rights convention we are not allowed to imprison asylum seekers if they have n't broke any law . 
  you say we shall do it ? 
  anyway . 
  you got last year as many migrants via croatia as via hungary . 
  this year you are expected to get 400k , only fewcoming via hungary . 
  imo , you are barking at the wrong tree . 
   if what you describe would happen , i would n't be romanian . 
  yup and nope . 
  you would be what you want to be - but relatively few people have the moral strength ( or interest ) to shape themselves to a nationality . 
  most people just go with the wave . 
   maybe the romanian spouse was a hungarian ethnic ? 
  nope , 100 % orthodox romanian . 
  she did learnt hungarian though ( and has my esteem ) . 
  she now speaks hungarian to her daughters . 
   wonderful city , felt a lot like home . 
  really glad to hear that , hope you 'll revisit !, 
  if i were born in berlin out of two romanian parents , it 'd be completely different . 
  you 'll more likely be different than your parents . 
  do n't underestimate how much your peers shape you . 
  for example : my very hungarian cousin and his wife live in uk for 15 years . 
  their daughters speak english to each-other ; and i know parents tried really really hard for that not to happen . 
  example 2 : romanian ( she ) - hungarian couple living in budapest . 
  the daughters speak hungarian even if they were raised in a purely romanian speaking environment until kinder-garden age . 
  so after this lying clown had a big influence on screwing uk , hopes eu27 will be even more screwed based on the healthy balkanic principle : my goat is sick but i 'm happy because both of my neighbor 's goats are sick as well ... 
  even if eu27 would do the same we 'd still have them at the borders . 
  anyway , i agree , your solution is the way to go . 
  probably mods clicked the wrong button and they meant duplicate . 
  you are looking at kaliningrad - it 's a place for long term russian tourism . 
  the / r/worldnews post you link to was deleted - [ here 's ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4uf8x5/explosion_at_restaurant_in_ansbach_germany_causes/ ) one allowed to stay . 
   only for those who wish not to be registered . 
  that was in september last year . 
  nowadays the only way in ~ ~ hungary ~ ~ germany is if their asylum requests are granted by hungary . 
  what i topically find missing from this types of analysis is the following : why are populists on the rise ? 
  were they sent by evil aliens ? 
  - this gets sometimes condensed into one paragraph max - then we get one page decrying the dangers of it . 
  wan na fix the problem ? 
  identify the roots and act there - not really rocket science . 
   other than a flat refusal of quotas and severe limitations to the numbers accepted actually one of the proposals was not to allow anyone uncontrolled into mainland by means of taking over unhcr camps or creating eu funded camps outside europe . 
  the asylum requests would be judged there . 
  so , a key difference was : handle all asylum requests outside europe or in isolated hotspots vs let everyone in and we 'll figure who 's entitled . 
  also for example czechia volunteered to take the same number of people as allocated by quota but then the commission said `` nope , it 's mandatory ''  perhaps surprisingly , my country is one of them i am aware of that - but was n't it so that the migrants laughed in your prime minister 's face when asked if they want to go to portugal ? 
  thanks for explaining the rest . 
   was almost a feeling of `` we 've dealt with it , we do n't give a fuck anymore '' . 
  i ca n't comment on his behalf but for me is more like `` not again '' . 
   refugees are still dying . 
  eu and non-eu countries are still enduring migrations pressures . 
  let 's talk specifics first ( from the article ) :  a group of around 300 men , mainly from afghanistan , pakistan and iran i refuse to believe they are dying all the way from those countries up till germany . 
  onto the general : v4 does n't believe that the current ec proposal ( mandatory quotas ) is feasible . 
   it was very much made into a binary issue by the v4 - either implement at an eu scale what they eventually implemented on their own , or ... that . 
  care to elaborate a bit more ? 
   of course you 'd claim that . 
  sorry , if you heard that 10000 times already  - what would be an acceptable solution for you ? 
  i am not sure i understand 100 % what you mean . 
  when eu did n't listen to v4 we went to `` second best solution '' - defending our borders . 
  if anything we proved that fences do work , some frontex report even claim that the domino effect of closing the borders had a bigger impact on decreasing migration on the balkan route than the deal with turkey . 
   and hungary , as part of the world community , can not simply shrug their shoulders as if it 's none of their concern . 
  what do you want us to do ? 
  let everyone in/through ? 
   when the brexit will actually be enforced , then we will be able to monitor its actual effects . 
  markets included expectations . 
  so what we see now is the uncertainty as a result of brexit vote . 
  ( your title is better indeed ) . 
  this reminds me when our constitutional court initially decided that throwing eggs at politicians was freedom of speech - but they overturned eventually . 
  sorry , got it now . 
  some redditors with uk flags consider that anything else than `` full access to eu market '' but without free movement of people would be punishment for uk - you can find those usually at the bottom of threads/posts . 
   source ? 
  you can find some comments in line of `` eu must give in because we 're a large trade partner '' along with `` ftse 250 is down but dax is worse - take that '' in about any thread discussing the `` what to do next '' wrt brexit . 
  not only czech have this problem : http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/atheltic-bilbao-fans-arrived-at-budapest-829834, 
  for all tourists visiting australia - you might consider the short trip from vienna to beautiful bucharest , capital city of hungary . 
  thanks , i edited my post accordingly . 
  let 's hope they will actually follow them . 
  in theory suspension of human rights means the authorities can do whatever they want ( edit : nope ~ ~ state enticed torture included ~ ~ ) . 
  fully agree with / u/aliencow that 's frightening . 
  we had that post '45 and it was n't nice - with situation like neighbors ratting on each-other just because they wanted your property . 
  except for the bitter history , is there any ongoing dispute on why croatia would want to block serbia ? 
  do n't forget the active elements of their shield . 
  if america is to retreat from nato i see no reason to provoke russia . 
  good luck when you put the interceptors in new york . 
  also us is losing virtually nothing with the russian embargo while being its strongest advocate . 
  count that too towards gdp contribution . 
  use google . 
  seriously first result for `` tax back european union '' is this : http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/common/travellers/leave_eu/vat_refund_index_en.htm, 
  also to / u/oblio - actually one of our founding legends claims we are related : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hunor_and_magor hunor is also a quite common name ( not as common as attila though ) . 
   the palestinians were there first sorry , what ? 
  have you heard of the old testament ? 
   unexpectedly against sanctioning poland . 
  serious question : was it really unexpected ? 
  i mean , world and dog know of polish-hungarian friendship . 
   orban manage to curtail judicial independence in 2011 without a hitch respectfully informing you that orban 's party won 2/3 of parliament on elections organised by the socialists . 
  so yeah , they have the people 's mandate to do whatever they wanted - i guess democracy is good only if the right candidate wins . 
  ( i hate orban btw ) .
