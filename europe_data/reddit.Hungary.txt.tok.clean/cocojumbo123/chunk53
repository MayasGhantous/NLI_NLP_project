  yeah , reverse psychology should be renamed to `` british politics '' . 
   you do not have leverage ... there is none i guess in that fairyland they think merkel will be begging on her knees for the britts to buy bmws while offering everything they want and some more ... , 
   do n't , and expect to be treated with hostility while negotiating . 
  but then please do n't complain that you will be treated with hostility as well . 
   i wa n't an apology for the huns to invade europein 375 . 
  not sure how much hun is in hungary but please accept my apologies . 
  sajnos kicsit kestel : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4smhsr/uber_to_pull_out_of_hungary/, 
  good read indeed but the translation is horrendous !, 
  - anyway , i have huge respect for habermas . 
  along with zizek , chomsky and umberto eco ( rip ) they are proving why philosophy is still relevant in today 's world . 
  mkay - although i call bs . 
   pure semantica . 
  bosnia and herzegovina does actualy not consist of two different distinct parts . 
  grenland is not green ect . 
  it was a federation . 
  it was a country wit a centrelizrd goverment . 
  yes , it was a fucking dictatorship . 
  i posted you the relevant article on how a nato country can exit the alliance . 
  could you post the relevant article on how a country can exit the russian federation ? 
  or the cccp ? 
  also , since the article is so fond on historical rights , could you please explain what the fuck is russia doing in kaliningrad ? 
  if you see red under the words you type that does n't mean reddit agrees with the glorious red army but you are making some spelling mistakes . 
  i do n't care what he 's fond of but the article has extremely weak arguments though !, 
  and still he keeps on defending those , 
   a federation , not a union of countries i do n't know man . 
  i do n't speak russian but i 'm sure you do :  from russian \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 ( sssr ) , abbreviation of \u0421\u043e\u044e\u0437 \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0421\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a ( soj\u00faz sov\u00e9tskix socialist\u00ed\u010deskix resp\u00fablik , `` the ** union ** of soviet socialist republics '' ) . 
   nato has no exit protocol , a country can not exit nato . 
  statements like this makes me think you are a putinbot :  after the treaty has been in force for twenty years , any party may cease to be a party one year after its notice of denunciation has been given to the government of the united states of america , which will inform the governments of the other parties of the deposit of each notice of denunciation . 
  separator  ussr was not a militari aliance but a country lolwut ? 
  ussr was a union of countries !, 
  chechenia part of it . 
  but in case you slept during last 20 years ussr ! = russia no matter how much putin would like to bring it back . 
  but nato will never invite a country which does n't want to apply . 
  [ for example ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_49212.htm ) : `` the former yugoslav republic of macedonia \u00b9 has been assured that it will be invited to become a member as soon as a mutually acceptable solution to the issue over the country 's name has been reached with greece . '', 
  so what do you think : nato wants macedonia in more than macedonia itself wants it ? 
  edit : are you aware of any country invited to join nato which refused ? 
  also any country is free to exit nato at any time . 
  ask czechenia about exiting ussr ... 
  oh boy , what a load of crap . 
  a good mixture of half truths , opinions stated as facts and complete bollocks . 
  apparently , nato expanding ( btw - nato expands by countries requiring/almost begging to be admitted ) is much worse than russia invading some countries because hey `` muh minorities '' - btw : was n't this the same reason hitler annexed parts of czechoslovakia ? 
  nato holds a 30k people exercise - boooo ; conveniently missing russia 's 100k people exercises at poland 's border . 
  also the article teaches us that the us dismembered yugoslavia . 
  wow . 
  not like the war was n't ongoing , slovenia was already out , sarajevo & co , etc. 
  also no words mention of czechenia ... 
  i 'm not disagreeing with you but even a vb 8.0 expert would scream in pain imo ... c'mon , in the age of rest api ? 
   but merkel is still against one with the uk do you have a source ? 
  because in my memory , compared with junker ( uk has to trigger art 50 immediately ) or holland ( we 'll take the city ) , merkel showed great restraint and understanding ( let 's give them some time ) . 
  while germany has a lot of influence indeed , merkel lost a lot of goodwill with her pushing through with the refugees redistribution . 
  and do n't forget that in eu27 not everybody cares if brits buy bmws . 
  for example romania threatened with veto on ceta if canada does n't lifts visas for romanians . 
  expect similar situations to happen during brexit negotiations . 
  for example if uk wants to deport current eu citizens , expect a big veto on any deal from poland , hungary , romania and bulgaria . 
  not anymore , but it was after ww2 . 
  same as in romania . 
  the trouble is not free trade . 
  the trouble is that while production and distribution are globalized , corporate taxation is localized . 
  it 's scary if you think that in the '70s an average us family could live comfortably with only one family member working . 
  today that 's almost a dream pretty much everywhere . 
  one would expect that as productivity increases - aka value created by a productive person - the standard of living will increase as well . 
  true that , if we consider global scale , 500 million chinese are out from poverty and into the middle class . 
  but if the governments do n't tackle the ever growing income inequality things will go south from here . 
   even germany refuses to grant us a free trade agreement germany , as member of eu , ca n't grant anyone a free trade agreement . 
  if you keep quiet you year the screams of developers who had to implement this abomination . 
  here you can also see the shop below the table : http://www.cfr.ro/webcamgn.jpg, 
   russian would not be so useful in ( eastern ) europe ? 
  it will be useful in slavic speaking ee countries but that 's not because russian is important but because they are in the same language family . 
  anyway , for the young generation you can get along in english . 
  in non slavic countries ( e.g. 
  romania , hungary ) almost nobody understands russian . 
   it 's impossible to deny the importance of russian in eastern-europe actually is entirely possible . 
  nobody speaks it around here despite for it being mandatory for 40 years . 
  go for spanish . 
  or chinese . 
  or german . 
  but would n't adding more workforce further increase the trade unbalance ? 
  i mean more people - more production ; and germany is not us in terms of credit fueled internal consumption  would benefit all of us much more though ( incl . 
  reducing imbalance ) by sending money home ? 
  sorry , macro-economy is not exactly my strength . 
  showerthought : work only 4 days a week so that total output will decrease ? 
  you guys also love vacations - more vacations , more germans anschlussing the beach chairs ( and spending some money ) . 
  maybe you wanted to link something ? 
  the friendly russian was just trying to help the obviously drunk amerikanski . 
  i was thinking that the eu public might grow increasingly irritated if uk is perceived as dragging their foot around - putting slight pressure on candidates to promise ( at least verbally ) a tough stance . 
  anyway , it will be interesting to watch eu27 's response given the fact they would n't be too happy to wait for two more years just for art 50 to be triggered . 
   triggering earlier would seriously harm uk position since there are elections in germany and france next year which will take their attention . 
  interesting , thanks for sharing . 
  just wait until candidates in germany and france start promising to be tough in negotiations . 
  also , do they address that uncertainty is more harmful for uk economy than to eu ? 
  they blocked because the others were willing to let go not to anger uk . 
  now ... 
  i do n't think it requires unanimity ... 
  i doubt serbia is that bad . 
  and anyway , is unhcr an asylum placement company ? 
  because it acts like one . 
  it 's tiring to beat the same bush around . 
  could unhcr explain why those people did n't apply for asylum in serbia ? 
  german efficiency & engineering . 
  that shall start with native french people stopping making fun of people who speak french as a second language or with funny accents ( belgium , quebecois ) .
