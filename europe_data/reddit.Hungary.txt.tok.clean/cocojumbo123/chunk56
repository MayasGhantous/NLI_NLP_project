  on top of this , if you want to have a better look at the uk economy ftse 250 is worth watching . 
  and if you want to have an even better view of today vs before brexit watch ftse 250 denominated in usd not gbp . 
   economical - if you factor in all transfers of wealth between countries the rich countries might be actually benefiting ok , let 's start with the obvious : larger markets . 
  since they can trade freely they can sell their products there and get back a part of profit . 
  also let 's take an example : audi factory in hungary . 
  should audi build it 's factory in germany the cars would had been more expensive - favoring japanese brands . 
  this way audi wins , hungary wins ( jobs + taxes ) , germany wins ( taxes ) . 
  not so obvious examples : when the market opened many international behemoths bought local companies/resources at fire sale prices . 
  this both destroyed any ( potential ) competition + increased their production base . 
  with the free circulation of people they have access to a wide range of highly educated people ( stem , doctors , etc ) but not only - heck , pubs at balaton ca n't find good waiters since they moved to austria . 
  edit : to put from a personal perspective . 
  i work for / ( i.e. 
  creating value ) for a western company , i do my shopping in a french supermarket and my money is in a german bank . 
  i drive a japanese though , 
  ** peace ** - quite self explanatory ** political ** - increased leverage negotiating with other super powers ** economical ** - if you factor in all transfers of wealth between countries the rich countries might be actually benefiting . 
  i really wish traffic would ever be so good on our bridges as well , 
  site is blocked by ublock origin . 
  do you have another source ? 
  you are absolutely right . 
  however :  and 20 days after 20 years . 
  [ 131 ] [ 134 ] that 's less than a newcomer gets here . 
  also where do you think the `` working class '' will happen to be on this range ? 
  my sides - thanks for sharing . 
  also this just popped up in my news-feed : https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/06/28/how-brexit-threatens-one-of-britains-biggest-perks/?tid=sm_fb, 
   we need commies back , the real commies who were those ? 
  and privatize the nhs . 
  everyone knows state is the worst administrator / s, 
  what i am missing from this is a clear ( from a legal pow ) definition on what a robot is . 
  should people who buy roombas pay some tax to the cleaning industry ? 
   we should scrap eu-mandated labour market regulations and social protections as fast as possible . 
  there is no reason why we should accept european limits on how many hours people do in the office - so long as we have a minimum wage in place , which we do , then it is up to every individual how long a shift he or she wants to put in . 
  issues such as parental leave can be freely agreed between companies and staff . 
  employers who want to hire lots of young women , the best educated , most skilled part of the workforce , will be generous ; others less so . 
  but business can decide for itself . 
  this got ta be good . 
  maybe also removing the mandatory vacation . 
  i mean if us can live with 2 weeks of paid vacation/year others can do it too . 
  also the next paragraph mentions cutting taxes for businesses . 
  too bad there is no mention on taxes for the population - anyone willing to guess what will happen to those ? 
  edit : do n't get me wrong , i am not saying this will not work - but i have serous doubts that the main segment of leavers will be better off . 
  quite the contrary . 
  if the company wants to hire you badly then yes - they 'll most probably write a job description to match your qualifications . 
  otherwise no . 
  and do n't get me started about companies not being too keen to hire someone without a work visa or how you can not get a work visa without a contract . 
   you just need a visa or something or something indeed . 
  an eu company must prove there was no candidate from an eu country before considering non eu nationals . 
  dude , seriously , use some formatting . 
  i remember reading many years ago ( 5-10 ) that due to eu regulations there are again fish in thames ( in london ) - previously it was too polluted . 
  now since leave are rejecting eu regulations , i guess it 'll be ok to poison their environment . 
  and some kids . 
  yes , i know , i 'm projecting fear . 
  edit : corrected river name thanks to / u/eureaditor, 
  this post is more suited for / r/askeurope and will be probably removed by mods within minutes . 
  also it 's terribly unclear what your actual question is . 
  or , i was misunderstood and i never meant that . 
  just ask nigel . 
  they ca n't send the severed horse head - in eu we have animal protection laws ; i guess uk 's gdp will grow yuuuge with fox hunting and testing of beauty products on animals ... 
  yes the pope is dressed in white but the catholic priests are also dressed in black although they wear man 's clothes . 
  i seriously do n't understand the delusion of some people who still think the financial capital of the eu and ez can be outside eu . 
  well , since it 's about turtles i had to read it ...  here 's my tl ; dr for you : i disagree with the result of the referendum and i want to repeat the vote until the `` right '' answer comes - i can make you a paragraph by paragraph analysis if you want to . 
  now do n't get me wrong - i totally understand how you fell - fuck ; do you think i wanted orban for a second term ? 
  you thought you are part of the majority . 
  turns out you are n't . 
  you are in denial . 
  that 's normal . 
  you will get over it . 
  the beauty and at the same time the ugliness of a democracy is that majority decides . 
  even if the majority is made of half brain dead idiots . 
  and as someone who was born and raised in a dictatorship trust me that it 's the least worst system . 
  yes , with the real risk of millions of people across the planet losing their jobs ... 
   the only change -- and it will not come in any great rush -- is that the uk will extricate itself from the eu 's extraordinary and opaque system of legislation : the vast and growing corpus of law enacted by a european court of justice from which there can be no appeal . 
  seri-fucking-ously - poor ecj is now the greatest obstacle for uk 's prosperity ? 
  i really hope # 50 gets involved asap . 
  also i am curious when he will backtrack from this statements - excuse my saltiness but i thought western politicians are better than ours . 
  apparently not - at least when our ex-pm was recorded admitting lying there were massive demonstrations ( he did n't quit ) . 
  incognito or private ( depending on your browser ) . 
  well , since friday we speak american , right ? 
  the gram . 
  and it will be 10 times higher when 1 usd will equal 100 gpb . 
  would n't that be undemocratic ? 
  i mean , elected people not representing the wishes of the people ? 
  i mean , one of the key complaints of brexiters ? 
  thanks a lot . 
  this article : http://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/248265/london-banking-redundancies-brexit/ gives a bit more dtails but i do n't know how reliable the source is . 
  paywall :(, 
  no idea , it might be that they are using country filtering . 
  anyway , thanks for the post - good article ; i just hope the eurocrats are really as prepared as the article claims . 
  people with paywall problem : it works if you open it in porn mode . 
  i have no idea why we are on the list . 
  no party has called yet for a referendum and anyway ~ 70 % of population supports eu . 
  i guess they confused us with turkey again - damn name similarity . 
  actual source : https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/brexit-eu-disintegration-inevitable-by-george-soros-2016-06 also there is hope according to him :  but we must not give up . 
  admittedly , the eu is a flawed construction . 
  after brexit , all of us who believe in the values and principles that the eu was designed to uphold must band together to save it by thoroughly reconstructing it . 
   `` global quotas '' sounds very much like `` everybody gets some '' to me that was detailed in some other interview which i remember but ca n't find - any google search at that time is filled with `` germany welcoming refugees '' and `` hungary opposing them '' . 
  anyway , the issue is moot now . 
   i doubt that our next chancellor will be able to fill her boots ( in terms of european power ) immediately . 
  some critics were claiming she eliminated all dangerous opponents risking you 'll be left with a week chancellor when she steps down . 
   the response of the afd leaders was very ... confusing . 
  here orban was predictable - eu leaders need to listen more to the people and do n't force quotas , blah , blah .
