  that 's like if my wife would file for divorce to `` make our relationship better '' . 
   either way the eu has a problem true - but the free movement of goods and ** people ** is not one of them . 
   so they can either double down and punish britain nobody will `` punish '' uk . 
  but at this point i do n't see why uk shall we treated better than let 's say elbonia should it wish to join the eu . 
  i will actually write to my ep asking him to not allow ** any ** concession to uk . 
   now that they 've won the real negotiations start . 
  real negotiation about what ? 
  also as a side note the latest concessions to cameron from eu were just declared nill . 
  and how exactly dragging your feet to start the negotiation will help staying in the single market ? 
  i mean while uk is in eu you will still have to pay the 350b/week ( which could go to nhs ) and accept all migrants from ee . 
  ai n't this why you want to leave ? 
  i certainly hope so . 
  uncertainty on the markets over extended period of time while central banks all have around 0 interests is exactly what the planet does n't need . 
   but at the end of the day what they 're doing is best for the uk at this point . 
  do you understand this is not a zero sum game ? 
  unless there is some certainty so that the market can stabilize there is a high risk of global recession . 
  as we speak hiring , expansions and investments are put to hold across the planet . 
  and why is this ? 
  well because uk is busy deciding who 's gon na replace cameron . 
   but logically it makes sense . 
  it might make sense on this particular topic but it 's impossible to extrapolate for all the topics . 
   has the same needs as your self and they by all means do have the same needs to vote on your rights as a worker ? 
  there was no vote on anyone 's rights , but something impacting the whole country . 
  i 'm really disappointed with both the result and the behavior of brittish politicians . 
  hey , in october maybe there 'll be a successor . 
  farage - you know that 350b . 
  leave was joking . 
  johnson - why hurry ? 
  sorry but they should grow some and act as quickly as possible . 
  no , instead we have the same old party politics at the expense of the planet . 
  just because a category of people voted in a way i do n't like does n't mean they should n't have the right to vote taken away . 
  sorry , this is not how democracy works . 
   because the uk does not want to become a second norway , so no efta norway is paying contributions to eu budget and must allow free movement of persons < - the main points leave was against, 
  when the lights begin to fade i sometimes feel a little strange a little anxious when it 's dark ... 
   i 'm sure that there would be just a small number of people with something negative to say the people with negative opinions to say most probably do n't speak any foreign language so you would n't understand that anyway , 
  generally speaking people from richer countries will always consider themselves superior to people from poorer ones . 
  i personally know cases of romanian-hungarians being discriminated in germany and switzerland . 
  or a hungarian guy whom could n't get a rent in germany until he grow a beard and started telling he 's a theology student . 
  so , if something bugs me that 's not the open `` xenophobia '' but the silent discrimination when it comes to promotions at workplace , etc. 
  now , i fully agree , a campaign based on fear ( like ukip is doing ) is a shameful thing to do . 
  our jobbik started by promissing they will solve the `` gypsy criminality '' problem . 
  do n't worry . 
  almost noone can recognize romanian language - i tested this ( by accident ) with some of my romanian friends . 
  also very few people ever met a romanian ( as in romanian-romanian and not a hungarian-romanian ) . 
   when it comes to ee , the good people never stick out . 
  you mean decent people working decent jobs and trying their best to blend in their communities ? 
   yes , a bit hard to stick out . 
  slovenians feel superior to croats , hungarians to romanians , romanians to bulgarians , etc. 
  no offence , but based on what you say that 's not xenophobia but good ole ' superiority complex . 
   i think it is , because those preferences are based on generalizations , misconceptions and stereotypes . 
  xenophobia has a component of irrational fear into it , so no it is not necessarily . 
  i do n't care being called names - what bugs me is when it 's blatant lies/misinformation . 
  and to be fair , most of the time labeling someone with `` xyz-phobia '' or `` anti-abc-ism '' is in many cases an attempt to silence dissenting opinions . 
   also , do you ever see westerners treating easterners as their equal ? 
  no , but i do n't see easterners treating other easterners as equals either, 
  i do n't understand germans . 
  should such thing happen in glorious orbanistan the parliament will immediately set the limit to something like 100 years ( just in case ) . 
  i 'm looking with a bleeding heart at all that potential strawberry palinka . 
  i mean after 2 distillations i bet that all evil ukrainian spirits would had gone away . 
  ca n't tell - hopefully some native italian can tell weather `` illuminismo '' means enlightened or illuminated . 
  i used the term in the sense of enlightened but i am neither native english speaker nor italian so the difference is lost indeed . 
  to my knowledge machiavelli used the term subjects in the literal way . 
  keyword in his theory is `` illuminated '' dictator - i mean any idiot can be a dictator but not all idiots will be steve jobs . 
  poor machiavelli . 
  you do know that in il principe he advocates for an illuminated dictator whom will do whatever needed for the benefit of his subjects - and not for his own !, 
  in the [ original column ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/20/brexit-crash-pound-living-standards-george-soros?cmp=share_btn_wa ) which cnbc is quoting from , soros claims :  i would expect this devaluation to be bigger and more disruptive than the 15 % devaluation that occurred in september 1992 , when i was fortunate enough to make a substantial profit for my hedge fund investors , at the expense of the bank of england and the british government . 
  the end of the world is near . 
  soros and orban agreeing on one thing !!!, 
  did you read the article ? 
  in the first snippet :  in the us , libel , which by definition is false , is already punishable by law . 
  so are ` fighting words ' , and plots and actions to cause physical harm . 
  beyond that , let speech rip like lear howling on the heath, 
  i do n't like him but i dislike his opponents even more . 
  and i know many people in the same situation . 
   greece has been a nation before hungary was even a concept no offence but nobody knows - since the origin of hungarians are not clear . 
  actually even jobbik ( which were burning eu flags not so long ago ) are declaring they want hungary in eu ... 
  actually bmw is not one of them . 
  we have audi and mercedes ( and suzuki ) . 
  but yes , totally agreeing with you - without eu and factories coming with it we 'd be fucked . 
  that 's actually one of the arguments of anti-eu people . 
  once the behemoths enter small and medium companies have little to no chance to survive . 
  to be fair , poland has plenty of local companies . 
  i ca n't think of an outstanding hungarian company ( except obivous big ones like mol and otp ) but for example in romania dedeman beat to tears bricostore and praktiker . 
  daaaaaam it !, 
  you really had to write down in details how it 's done  i do it the same btw ( mix some bay leaves also ) , except mixing it with garlic piure at the end . 
  also we do n't put salt and pepper on top of it but use vinegar and horse radish . 
  some people eat it with onion or onion salad . 
  fun fact : the 1 ( one ) nokia factory in hungary was giving at peak a bit more than 3 % of gdp ( if i remember it right ) . 
  there was an article on our biggest internet portal on how even a hickup of some of our biggest factories ( all german car manufacturers ) would badly impact our gdp . 
  why is it always germany trying to tone things down - and opposing nato bases in poland . 
  i mean , as people put it in the other thread is not like nato will invade russia under a pretext of exercises . 
  also , as we know , if nato sneezes by accident to the east ( or west ) that 'll offend russia . 
  it 's also common here  - kocsonya . 
  according to hungarian wiki : https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/kocsonya it is present europe 's first cook-book in 1395 which was french ... 
   racituri/piftii no offence , but i think that 's french . 
   veto possibility i see is from hungary because their governments is against this narrative huh ? 
  what does the press says we did again ? 
  i was thinking that assuming ad absurdum that our government would be pushing anti-poland propaganda on a daily basis , it will still take at least 2 generations ( i.e. 
  ~ 50 years ) before our historical friendship will go out of peoples mind ... 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pole_and_hungarian_cousins_be latest historical biggie is that during ww2 our prime minister flatly out refused to allow germany on transiting hungary on the way to poland saying we 'd rather bomb our rail tracks than to allow that .
