  yup - found [ this ] ( https://books.google.hu/books?id=jhexawaaqbaj&amp;pg=pa109&amp;lpg=pa109&amp;dq=romania+colonists+dobruja&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nyegrjcesn&amp;sig=1oacpzxbnhs2jlri2w2_omlydzk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=romania%20colonists%20dobruja&amp;f=false ) on google books , go up one page to 108 ( i ca n't copy paste from google books ) . 
  wikipedia to the rescue - i ca n't find something better now : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dobruja#demographic_history, 
   i guess what bothers me from a historical perspective is the pressure to become romanian the massive relocation of romanians in dobruja is quite well documented . 
  also i ca n't be too mad about it since we did the same   some of the romanian nobility also spoke bulgarian for a long period of time well , of course - since it was the language of the church . 
  however , after french revolution , the orientalism was considered `` old '' whereas western ( french ) was `` cool '', 
   relatinization started in the late 1700 's in transylvania under the watch and action of junimea junimea was from moldova ... in the 19 ` th century  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/junimea - you might be thinking of transylvanian school which started in late 18 ` th century . 
   in the 19th century , the romanian lexis was severely re-romanized by importing words from latin , italian , and to the greatest extent , french . 
  yes , that 's also what i said !, 
   not to mention that bulgarians in romania underwent severe romanization how is this relevant to the topic ? 
  - same happened to hungarians btw . 
  lol thanks . 
  just like i do n't feel guilty of my color i do n't feel proud either ... and i do n't feel pride/guilty of my height/nationality/gender / dicksize/handsize etc - all the things i was born with . 
  no offence - are you american ? 
  i mean , really , the first question is : `` do you feel guilty for being white ? '', 
  there is not much white guilt in europe ... not to mention : why shall anyone feel guilty over something they do n't control ? 
  i mean it 's not like my parents asked me `` listen son , which color of the rainbow you wan na be ''  also `` which european countries do you believe have sound policies that benefit their people ? '', 
  - took me an eternity to click all of them . 
  no politicians will have policies which will intentionally harm their country because then they will not get reelected !, 
  but i filled it out , 
  thanks for depressing me - i just had to click on the link in this comment : https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1dp3cb/how_much_did_slaves_in_america_cost_in_todays/c9skpn0, 
   my only objection is that people are able to murder dependants while pretending what they 're doing is n't murder , punishing such behavior is a complete waste of time you are opening the pandora 's box : you can not `` murder '' a cell . 
  or two . 
  or three . 
  this argument has validity only if someone manages to define personhood . 
  and please do n't bring the potentiality argument because that 'll mean at each male masturbation one `` murders '' potentially half million einsteins and half million hitlers . 
   pro-life people are n't spawning these babies ? 
  the problem with pro-life is that they do n't give a flying fuck what happens with those babies after they are born . 
  do you think a woman will have abortion ( not a pleasant thing neither physically or emotionally ) because she is afraid of the 9 month pregnancy or because she will need to take care of the baby for many years after ? 
   mothers who fail to prevent or terminate their pregnancy before the time a human-like structure forms in their womb which is when ? 
  which week ? 
  do n't get me wrong - i 'm a catholic . 
  abortion is a sin and i object to it . 
  but at the same time i want to keep religion and law separated . 
  any person should have the right to do what they want with their own bodies . 
  i drink and smoke ( both sins ) - but i would n't want a law forbidding me that on religious grounds . 
  while on topic i highly recommend the movie aferim ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4374460/ ) - the beginning is a bit slow but do n't let that fool you . 
  also is there any data on how much would a slave cost in today 's money ? 
  in hungary we are in this situation since 2010-2011 . 
  i am glad news traveled so fast ... 
   but the question is how much different it would be without the eu under the same period . 
  i ca n't speak for other countries but imo hungary would be a oligarchy akin ukraine , russia or belarus . 
  imo , the best thing coming from eu pressure is the public spending transparency . 
  should my country not be in eu all power ups would be stealing like there 's no tomorrow . 
  from economical perspective the situation would be even more dire . 
  mot of our gdp growth is coming from the eu funds . 
  just compare the ee eu members ( v4 + co ) with the ee non-eu members ( serbia , macedonia , albania , etc ) . 
  i think , i posted the previous one to wrong parent ...  because not being able to take care of yourself is worse than death . 
  actually there are philosophers arguing that in term of person-hood an able person is more valuable than an disabled person ergo the mothers wishes should take precedence but that was not my point . 
  what i meant is that mothers of unwanted babies should n't be punished with raising them . 
  how about the pro-life camp is forced to adopt them ? 
   do we pay thieves for all the houses they have n't stolen from ? 
  why not ? 
  i really , really do n't understand the metaphor . 
   the rest of them are the second class citizens working on the german welfare system . 
  are you sure that if they 'd return ( i mean nothing stopping them ) they would n't be first class unemployed in their own country ? 
   i 'm saying compared to before the eu and now with eu . 
  before and after eu the purchasing power for hungarians more than doubled : http://www.indexmundi.com/hungary/gdp_per_capita_ ( ppp ) . html, 
  the average worker lives now much better than before ' 89 . 
  gosh people , am i the only one old enough to remember how life was then ? 
  because having smart and educated people working for local oligarchs for peanuts using ancient technology would have been so much better . 
  / s there is only one country on the planet which wants self reliance - that 's the best korea !, 
   now it is , after centuries of replacing slavic words with romance words . 
  it was not centuries but some tens of years - after the '48 revolution if something was happening for centuries that was slavic words infiltration due to fact that the slavon was mandatory to be used during mass in orthodox churches . 
  i might agree with you if : 1 . the state automatically takes care of ** all ** unwanted persons - and by taking care i mean raising them , not giving some small change to mothers 2 . mothers are properly compensated for their pregnancy, 
  why should they ? 
  romanian vocabulary is like 80 % derived from latin . 
   my initial post is trying to say that it 's not germany alone that is to blame for the refugee crisis obviously not - it 's not you whom created a war in syria and poverty in africa . 
  but i stick to my point : we respected our eu agreements !, 
  ( most of the time )  greece is completely consumed with its own problems ; there 's an election campaign in turkey . 
  both countries simply wave through huge numbers of refugees . 
  i guess this talks of greece and turkey ? 
  ( i.e. 
  not hungary ) listen , we 're far from spotless , but we 're not the nazi monsters depicted in media in aug-oct 2015 either ... edit :  the situation in hungary however was the reason germany suspended the dublin agreement . 
  no offence , this is bs, 
  some source would be nice ... up until september - when germany opened their borders - we had the highest asylum number of asylum request/capita in the whole europe . 
  why ? 
  because we applied dublin/schengen !, 
  to the letter !, 
  - and got scolded by the entire europe for doing that !, 
   compared with the population of each member state , the highest number of registered first time applicants in 2015 was recorded in hungary ( 17 699 first time applicants per million inhabitants ) , ahead of sweden ( 16 016 ) source , [ eurostat.pdf ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/7203832/3-04032016-ap-en.pdf/790eba01-381c-4163-bcd2-a54959b99ed6 ) edit : fml , you are partly right !, 
  i just remembered that in june hungary suspended dublin in the sense that we will not accept back migrants . 
  but ** not ** on not registering them . 
   i just love how non-germans in this sub are getting upset over how germans decide to spend their tax money and are demanding you guys to justify the decisions you make . 
  i also love it when non-hungarians/v4 in this sub are getting upset about hungary/v4 choosing where not to spend their tax money and are demanding us to justify the decisions we make ... 
   it also was hungary who disobeyd dublin first . 
  nope !, 
  we followed the rules by the letter !, 
  by your logic then greek government should start handling 1000 eur coupons which can be used only to buy greek products and they 'll be out of crisis right ? 
  any investment ( government or private ) is worth it if creates ** plus value ** . 
  the history is riddled with crisis caused by governments handing out money/cheap cred which was promptly used to consume . 
  you can not have a country where half of the people are in prison and the other is guarding them !, 
  for official recession we need ~ ~ 3 ~ ~ 2 consecutive quarters of `` negative growth '' . 
  edit : thanks / u/rainfolder for correction, 
  everybody is surprised - the government expected 1.7 growth  anyway , it 's too early to tell from only one quarter , i hope we recover . 
  government claims it 's due to reduced activity for car/parts makers ( largest exporters ) , slowness in accessing eu funds for q1 and a decline in construction . 
  the last one might be explained by constructors waiting for the decline in vat . 
  domestic demand is up ( at least in retail ), 
   btw , never heard of `` hallucinations '' as part of ptsd . 
  hallucinations can happen to very depressed persons . 
  after donald trump becomes president , canada will erect a wall to protect its borders from the million americans trying to escape .
