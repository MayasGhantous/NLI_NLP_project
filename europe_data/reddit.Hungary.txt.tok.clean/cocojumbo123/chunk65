  i 'm hungarian , we do n't use euro , 
   turkey is a transit point for illegal immigrants trying to reach europe ( as well as being a destination itself ; see immigration to turkey for details ) . 
  as a result of bilateral negotiations , a readmission agreement was signed between turkey and greece in november 2001 and went into effect in april 2002 . 
  for third-country nationals , this protocol gives the parties 14 days to inform each other of the number of persons to be returned after the date of illegal entry .

  many metal fans consider themselves having a special state of mind - so the typo was really funny - i imagined legions of metal fans head banging in syntagma square :d, 
   greece has to leave the eu - or at the very least the eurozone - and massively devalue its currency . 
  trouble is that devaluating currency will hit worse the most vulnerable - imagine that suddenly your pension ( converted to new currency ) is worth half . 
  same thing with deposits . 
  greece is definitely between a rock and a hard place - no easy solution unfortunately . 
   `` outraged '' is a metal state relevant : https://ametalstateofmind.com/ , 
  i 'd go for sanders - as european still find it amazing that us does n't have universal health care . 
  also the student loan industry is just crazy . 
  wrt mobile in romania it was fierce competition again  cosmote ( which were losing money ) decided for a new push - it was them who first brought 1000 minutes national calls + sms for 10 eur , when digi entered a bit later it kicked the ball even further . 
  if i remember well , the boss of vodafone romania was complaining a few months ago about too much competition which is pushing the prices too low , 
   please explain how i can get 1 gbps in romania for $ 10 per month , but not in deutschland ? 
  first i 'd like to clarify that i do n't take the side of operators/providers ( quite the contrary ) . 
  i worked many years for a telecom equipment producer so i 'm a bit familiar with the situation . 
  wrt romania there are several aspects : 1 . 
  romania is a special case in the sense that it had a huge amount of mesh/neighborhood networks with coax , so when t-com started offering dial-up or dsl most users laughed in their face 2 . 
  fierce competition - namely rds whom was not content to divide the market with the other operators but expanded aggressively ( probably the most important factor ) . 
  generally speaking , ee cities have more people living in commie blocks of flats meaning less initial investment 4 . 
  cost of deployment is lower due to cheaper manpower and less strict regulation about cable placement conclusion : imo fix networks providers in we seem content with existing market shares ( i would even suspect a bit of price fixing ) on the principle `` if everybody is expensive and shitty people wo n't switch '' . 
  try to find this very post and return with results ... 
  there was an article about foreigners and crime in spain which was removed like 2-3 days ago for example . 
  i do n't know if the reason for removal was good or not . 
  also cologne handling let many people wary of moderation here . 
  will this move be good or bad for his party at the next elections ? 
   this nonsensical `` huge cost '' ... 
  the cost is huge . 
  only spectrum will set you back few good billions . 
  for example there was this auction last year for 5 billion . 
  http://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/german-spectrum-auction-totals-e5-08b/ please note that was only for for a small part of the spectrum , the infrastructure will also set you back few more billions . 
  the important part is not so much how rich a country is but how much disposable money the telecom operators have . 
   no shit that the swiss have an army . 
  and swiss army is so good that they can beat anyone even using medieval weapons !!!!, 
  actually both scenarios you mention should work flawlessly with 4g  on the fixed side we still has plenty of internet coming via pots ( plain old telephonic system ) aka copper wire and local operators seem content with that . 
  also there is something weird with the competition in those places : after digi cabled my building , my upc bill went down 3 times and bandwidth went up 3 times ( from 20 to 60 mbps ) within 2 years . 
  it 's not so bad as the article mentions it - the costs for rolling out 5g networks will be huge . 
  for example in some scenarios ( smar cars/road sensors ) , 5g requires response times below 5 ms. 
  this can only be done by having a huge network of small antennas along the way - i.e. 
  very expensive . 
  so even if assuming all spectrum would be free it 'll take many years till roll-outs will actually begin to happen . 
  lol , ok , sorry i did n't got the context ... 
  according to hungarian law ( and few other eu countries ) one will most probably not be granted refugee status if coming through a safe country . 
  a tad unrelated but when arguing with someone from ee , calling them nazi or racists will almost never work . 
   was that on the table ? 
  apparently , some people in this thread imply it is . 
   i thought it was only about processed asylum seekers that were granted asylum in eu-hotspots . 
  `` only '' ? 
   are more than happy to accept money from the eu when it benefit them interesting . 
  so , in your opinion shall we unconditionally accept absolutely everything coming from eu/germany ( as largest contributor ) ? 
  corruption happened . 
  [ see link ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/von_neumann_architecture )  - please remark the `` as we know them today '' form my statement ... 
   we will never conclude the argument about who invented the computer computers as we know them today were obviously invented by von neumann ( hungarian ) - pretty much everything ( mobile phones to desktops ) are using his architecture ( cpu , gpu , memory bus , etc ) . 
   `` it would be difficult to explain to our american trading partners that they ca n't export any tyrolean ham or dutch gouda to us if we do not consistently enforce the protection , '' schmidt added . 
  call me confused but how the fusck can a tyrolean ham not be from tyrol or a dutch cheese not be from netherlands ? 
  i mean , yes !, 
  - we have today german made ( zott ) - greek style yogurt or black forest ** style ** ham ( gush , love that smoky thing ) - but are we gon na have california made `` parma cheese - parmgiano '' ? 
  or let 's take for example champagne - world and dog is content with calling it `` sparkling wine '' ( same taste , just cheaper ) - why on earth is good for the customers to call everything champagne ? 
  i mean , that 's more like a brand ( since they invented the damn thing ) us is more keen on sausages apparently than onto copyright law !, 
   while europe aims to export democracy to the south caucasus , it is denying georgia the prospect of one day joining the european club . 
  imo , this is solely due to the desire of not pissing off russia . 
  i respect georgia tremendously - especially after they fired their corrupt police force !, 
  ( twice ) . 
   so turkish islam , albanian islam , bosnian islam , kazakh islam , egyptian islam , saudi islam , iranian islam , indian islam and indonesian islam are all the same ? 
  obviously not . 
  but do you know the differences between all christian denominations ? 
  good point - i wrote the initial answer from mobile where denmark is much less visible than greenland . 
  it is proven that quotas solution does n't work - 1600 of the 160 000 were relocated so far . 
  otherwise , i 'm fully with you - been there , done that ... 
  i agree with everything you say , except this :  except they ca n't go to germany yes they can !, 
  as long as an entry country ca n't close them into guarded camps , to which half of the planet will scream `` nazi '' . 
   because germany does n't want them that 's not how the rest of the planet sees it . 
  the only thing which ** might ** change that is merkel publicly denouncing #willkommenskultur which we know it will never happen . 
  probably , germany applying german law - specifically : asylum requests to be denied , preferably at the border , if requestors come from a safe country would help . 
  otherwise the german border control is just a glorified registration point . 
  the end of the world is near , i know . 
  a hungarian telling a german to respect the rules ... < - jk , 
   as i know they sent most of their migrants with trains towards austria last autumn you are wrong !, 
  it was n't most - it was ** all ** of them , 
   but i have a feeling that even sending them against their will back to morocco is probably less hard of a task . 
  you know they ca n't do that ... every claim has to be assessed individually . 
  besides , most migrants coming to italy are departing from libya not morocco . 
   or rather , you think they only end up in germany , austria and sweden because the media only reports about germany , austria and sweden / u/atlas _ at is correct at least from a hungarian perspective . 
  only this year we had 10 000 people seeking asylum . 
  currently there are ~ 1800 in camps . 
  serbia took back around 50 . 
  your guess is as good as mine as to where they are but i do n't think they roam the streets of budapest . 
  a huge amount 90 % + of asylum requests here are denied due to `` applicant can not be found anymore '' . 
   austria took hungary 's place in that regard and austria was one of the most fierce critics of hungary and fences ... how things change . 
  heck , when we had the 2000 migrants marching on m1 - orban 's cabinet called fenyman 's cabinet just to be told `` we 're busy , call back in the morning '' . 
  it was only after merkel intervened ( few hours later ) that they agreed onto something . 
  ca n't really blame them though - it 's always easy to criticize from the outside . 
  sorry french , looks like english is winning !, 
  also what 's the thing with spanish in greenland ?
