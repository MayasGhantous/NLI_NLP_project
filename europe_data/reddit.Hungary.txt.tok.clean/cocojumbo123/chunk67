  if you are happy with the result the test is obviously accurate , other ways is rubbish !, 
  i did n't followed closely the momentum movement/party but what is their connection with ceu ? 
  facepalm !, 
  thanks , 
  i am 100 % sure i did n't understand it  so what was the 30 % easier about ? 
   with the hungarian goverment but a federal goverment has to too . 
  some comments actually say it might require a constitutional amendment in the us ... 
  in hungary ( movies are translated ) - some of the movies actually are better than the original . 
  for example bud spencer has a cult fallowing because the translated jokes were better than the original . 
  sorry , why is bizarre ? 
  again , any law needs a reason !, 
  reciprocating is not a good enough one - because the us side is not causing any damage to hungary . 
  the fact that ceu gives us recognized diplomas is an advantage - which we get for free !, 
  also ceu has ~ 20 % only hungarian students i.e. 
  ~ 300 people/year . 
  do you really think that 's a noticeable disadvantage for hungarian universities ? 
  ( not getting those 300 people ? ) . 
   yet , soros network minions never talk about that , it 's all about how hungary is ravelling into fascism . 
  does that make any sense to you ? 
  listen !, 
  if you go a bit down in my post history you will see that i strongly support orban 's stance on migrants . 
  i also defended him and his policies a million times in this sub . 
  and yes , i agree with you , lefties will exaggerate every fucking time to the point of `` literally hitler '' . 
  i am neutral wrt soros btw - because i care much more what orban does with my tax money than what soros does with his . 
  nevertheless , i strongly believe closing down one of the best universities in hungary ( on their field of study ) is just fucking wrong . 
  and dumb !, 
   why should hungary allow non-eu universities you are correct , but you are asking the wrong question . 
  hungary applies english law - everything which is not forbidden is permitted . 
  and for every law there needs to be a reason on why that law is needed ( we call that spirit of the law ) since every law is basically a restriction on freedom of people . 
  and whereas ceu is indeed linked to soros their academic performance is not !, 
  forbidding one of the best universities in hungary in their field of study is just plain dumb imo . 
  i completely fail to see what hungary might win from it . 
  oh , not to mention that ceu pays yearly ~ 30 million eur to the state budget as taxes . 
  after the election of 6 years ago the then ruling socialist party ( mszp ) imploded into 3 ( or 4 ) smaller parties . 
  the small factions are led by charismatic leaders but they wo n't ever get more than 5-7 % of the votes . 
  and due to egos they work together miserably . 
  for example , they proposed a laughable candidate as mayor candidate of budapest ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m928bri9orq ) - just to change him few weeks before the ellection . 
  ftr : budapest never had a fidesz mayor - even today 's one is independent , backed by fidesz . 
  also , the new election system has 106 ( out of 199 ) seats in parliament based on first past the post system . 
  this means that if any coalition wants to beat orban 's fidesz they will most probably need to ally with jobbik which is a hard to swallow thing for many people . 
  edit : majority of jobbik voters are not nazis ; jobbik has a strong anti corruption message and since they never governed they still have some credibility on the issue . 
  full disclosure : i did n't voted for jobbik , nor i intend to . 
  you mean like this ? 
   the bill proposes tightening regulations on non-eu universities issuing diplomas in hungary , forcing them to close if there 's no bilateral agreement with their home countries . 
  ceu , which is accredited both in the u.s. and in hungary , does n't have such an agreement . 
  another rule would require universities to have a campus in their `` home '' countries as well , a regulation which ceu alone does n't meet among 28 institutions reviewed , education ministry state secretary laszlo palkovics told reporters . 
  source : https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-29/soros-s-university-caught-in-orban-campaign-as-ceu-protests-law in hungarian media the gvnmt people claim the fact that ceu diplomas are recognized in us puts hungarian universities at a disadvantage . 
  shall i really explain you why this statement is dumb ? 
  and btw : the government could n't articulate on why this law is needed . 
  edit : also the ceu responds itself with what are the issues : http://www.ceu.edu/article/2017-03-28/ceu-responds-proposed-amendments-hungarian-higher-education-law, 
  their political thinking will influence their lectures . 
  an economically left professor will not praise the trickle down economy whereas a rightie will not preach on the virtues of communism , 
  why do english classes cost 30 % more ? 
  also , no offence , but i think english is a bit easier to learn - easier grammar ( no gender ) and no agglutination . 
  whatever a university teaches ( unless they teach something ** explicitly ** forbidden by law ) is not/should not be of any business to the government . 
  btw , you could call then any economics faculty not teaching matolcsy-sm as `` anti government '' ... 
   thus it would n't bear the name of that international criminal no offence , did you read the article ? 
  'cause the name of the university is `` central european university '' ... 
   do you guys not realise how disgustingly corrupt he is ? 
  we actually do - but as long as opposition ca n't agree on anything orban will stay . 
   i 'm pretty sure he talks about popper a lot soros 's philosophical system builds on popper 's , and he was his student , so yeah . 
  ceu did n't really got involved into hungarian politics though . 
  for the millionth time : american is lingua franca because of hollywood and music not because of uk being in eu or not . 
  german will become lingua franca when will be associated with things people think are cool . 
  i might be an unicorn but i am strongly against ** any ** form of censorship . 
  i do n't care so much about what what western countries do , i care about hungary . 
  banning of ** any ** ideas by ** any ** government is wrong imo . 
  edit : yes , even idiotic ones like flat earthers or holocaust deniers !, 
  and attempting of shutting down one of the highest ranking universities in hungary ( in their field of study ) is plain stupid !, 
  not to speak that we can build ~ 100km of fence yearly from their taxes !, 
  also i am less worried on what soros does with his money than what my government does with my tax money . 
  hungary closed well over 100 000 asylum requests from 2015 on the fact `` could not find applicant '' ... since they 're all in germany and sweden - asylum shopping happens since forever . 
  i 'm glad eu got the news 1.5 years later . 
   fantastic move by hungary !, 
  yup . 
  step 1 : ban universities step 2 : burn undesired books step 3 : inprison undesired people step 4 : ???? 
  step 5 : profit !!!, 
   if the law passes in the way it is proposed we both know that if orban really wants it , unless there is massive unrest ( like with the internet tax ) , it 'll pass . 
  true , it would n't be the first time the government proposes something ultragious only to back down to something less ultragious - which was probably what they wanted in the first place . 
   if ceu does not do anything about it opening a campus in new york because that 's our idiotic law ? 
  i would n't do it . 
   too many ` if 's for it to be presented as a fact that ce is facing closure agree , a better title could be `` ceu potentially facing closure '', 
  in hungary we do n't think though that soros works to give us transylvania  - i was told some romanians actually believe that . 
  if the law passes , ceu is facing closure . 
  what is fake ? 
  same here , it 's a sad day . 
  if it heats fast it 'll also cool fast at night . 
  construction workers routinely live in such containers when deployed on site and they do n't have ac either ; heck i had 32 degrees at 11 pm in my living room 2 years ago at 11 pm ... do n't get me wrong , i 'm not saying it 'll be pleasant - i am saying that parts of population live in similar conditions - considering this some form of abuse is ridiculous . 
  two things : 1 . 
  i doubt it 'll get much worse than the last floor of a commie block of flats ( which is under a tarred i.e. 
  black roof ) . 
  nobody seems to care that german shipping homes do n't have ac ( at least i do n't see it ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvapiy1vwyq, 
   these containers are obviously not suitable for migrants to be held the period of weeks and months . 
  ** they lack air conditioning ** you got to be kidding me . 
  i 'd say less than 30 % of households have ac here . 
  to me she sounded like any politician who does n't want to say yay or nay even before you clarified the translation . 
  hod do we know you are not one of them too ? 
  because if someone is perceived as nationalist or patriotic sooner or later they 'll get called nazis/alt-righters/etc . 
  of course its not their fault they just want the best for themselves ; it 's germanys `` fault '' for granting asylum for people coming via safe countries . 
   as we can hardly expect them to know the details of european asylum law .
