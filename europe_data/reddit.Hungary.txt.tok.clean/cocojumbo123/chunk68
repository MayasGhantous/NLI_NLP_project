  i think they know very well they should apply for asylum earlier - otherwise we would n't have had riots and demonstrations with chants like `` no fingerprints '' ... 
   provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence . 
  did you read your quote ? 
  because at least in hungary the authorities have to chase them . 
  you are not wrong but in this thread ( and many others ) we are mixing the legal definition and the common use . 
   i do n't really understand that argument to be honest . 
  they are asylum seekers once they apply for it ( anywhere ) . 
  assuming they want to apply only in germany what 's their legal status/name while in transit ? 
  unless they apply for asylum , transit countries have no obligation to allow them entrance - moreover , schengen border states have to prevent them from entering . 
   they get fingerprints and photos for later identification . 
  its not possible to check millions of people at the spot . 
  and no they arent immigrants - they are asylum seekers so those people who refused to apply for asylum in greece , macedonia , serbia and hungary are what then ? 
   hungries lol , have n't heard this one yet :d out of curiosity , how do you call hungary in danish ? 
  ( in hungarian denmark is d\u00e1nia , danish [ people ] is d\u00e1nok ) . 
  i do n't know where the newspaper is taking their info from , i can not find such statement in orban 's interview . 
  he said that it 's not smart policy to expect turkey to handle eu 's security while continuously `` poking '' them he also said ** `` i am not claiming that they [ turkey ] are innocent on the issue ... '' **, 
  mods , please do n't remove this !!!, 
  what i do n't see in news like this is the following : who is supposed to decide what 's hate speech and not ? 
  - obviously , if there is a clear cut court decision that 's it but i have a feeling this is not about that . 
  aside , fb is a medium for information relaying - i start to be glad no one owns the internet for it might get punished by `` germany '' for facilitating hate speech . 
  is n't it so that dutch authorities refused her entry ? 
  because the refusal of a diplomat to leave a country when asked to is also unprecedented . 
  i did read it - was just saying that what kern wants is already part of how eu functions - or does he wants some new mechanism ? 
  got ta love politics - the eu already has a mechanism handling unruly states - it 's called infringement procedure which can result in less money or fines . 
  so in september , the commission will probably start infringement against ** all ** states which did n't got their mandatory quota of `` solidarity '' - which according to data would probably be ~ 25 countries . 
  what did we do ??? 
   bitched about this being our fault for not just letting everyone in sorry sir , but unless you have some source that 's complete bs . 
   20.000 people stuck in budapest they were 2000 not 20 000 and not stuck in budapest but marching on m1 but sure , go on please - in at era facts are irrelevant . 
   so yeah they sure `` did it '' all by themselves , brave little hungary . 
  heroes a thank you for defending ** your ** borders would be nice . 
  we love you anyway . 
  i fully agree but the article is not about rights conferred by citizenship - unless i misunderstood it horribly . 
  and neither is parent 's comment on danishness . 
   everyone else wan na bet that a large part of population will call him ungur though ? 
  :p ( or even bozgor ), 
  i do n't think the article or parent 's comment are about the citizenship though . 
   you could have used canada or new zealand , where living there and participating in society is considered the foundation of citizenship . 
  hunor , son of attila and emese , born in szekelyudvarhely ( odorheiu secuiesc ) is what then  ? 
  where did you read that ? 
  check page 31 of this report - http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_354_en.pdf, 
  you pay vat only when buying a newly built house , so reducing vat means reduced price for those . 
  this government program applies to newly build houses . 
  it 's not so black and white ...  making it even more difficult for people with no children or with one child to afford a place of their own . 
  people with 3 kids tend to buy different type of flats/houses than singles . 
  also reduction of vat should compensate at least partly . 
   plus collects additional `` free money '' as a stay at home mother the amount of money for maternity leave is capped at ~ 500 eur/month . 
  assuming the mothers would not stay at home and send their kids to prekindergarden ( bolcsi ) instead that 'll also cost public money . 
  dude , do you realize that i do n't talk of changing the labeling for existing products but introducing labeling for new ones ? 
  as i said , currently , there are no gmo products here !, 
  this means that when the first gmo product hits the shelves ( probably cheaper ) all existing producers will have to change their labeling by adding non-gmo - which you admirably argued would be expensive . 
  besides , eu changed the labeling laws few times and the sky did n't fall down . 
   the only countries that have banned ge products are ecuador and kenya . 
  do you have a source ? 
  i am quite sure hungary bans it : http://naturalsociety.com/hungary-strikes-gmo-crops-initiates-widespread-gmo-rejection/  could demand labels based on the race or sexual orientation of the farmer why do you keep bringing up this bad example ? 
  anything remotely like this will be shot down immediately as unconstitutional . 
   does that automatically mean my government should institute mandatory labels depicting whether or not well-water was used ? 
  i have the right to ask for it . 
  obviously the gvnmt does n't have to accommodate my needs ( although that 'll be nice  . 
  if enough people require it ( and it 's constitutional ) then yes , the government should do it !, 
  ai n't this the point of democracy ? 
  however , in case of gmos and labeling most people in eu are opposing - meaning the governments will have to decide against the will of the majority of people . 
   who pays for the label ? 
  i am fairly sure it 'll pass down to the consumer . 
  but if you have something like this : http://imgur.com/gallery/hqiml ( just a random package ) - i am fairly confident the cost of adding 3 letter 's wont end the world . 
   being `` regulated '' ( as is usda organic ) does n't mean anything . 
  being eu organic means you have to grow the stuff under the regulation . 
  you can not put organic on your product in the eu unless you comply . 
  i also do n't care about usda regulations . 
   you mean like `` gmo-free '' labels , which deceive customers by making them think there are problems associated with gmos ? 
  i could n't possibly mean that since there is no such danger given that gmos are entirely banned in my country . 
  i gave you the example with chicken patee , but there are much more e.g. 
  `` milk '' and a very tiny `` like '' drink , etc. 
   you `` consider it your right '' ? 
  yup . 
   that 's not how rights work . 
  cute , because you say so ? 
   you ca n't make unjustified demands it would be unjustified if anyone would suffer due to my demand - which is not the case . 
  as i said : i want to label the exception not the norm . 
   what about people who demand to know if their food was handled by homosexuals ? 
  i am sure you can come up with better analogies because this one sucks . 
  and it 's a logical fallacy btw . 
   also , the labels you mention ( chickens/bio ) are voluntary labels like `` organic '' or `` gmo-free '' , not mandatory labels no offence , but do you live in us ? 
  in eu this things are regulated : https://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/organic/eu-policy/eu-legislation/brief-overview_en afaik ( from a friend ) he needed to stop using pesticides entirely for 4 years before he can label something as bio , and even the storage has to be pesticide free . 
  the eggs are also regulated - the first digit on the code you find on each egg will tell you where the chicks were living . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/egg_marking#method_of_production wrt corn & co : you are partly right . 
  however ... 
  i can choose though between apple varieties ; farmed vs wild fish , few types of pork and even more types of beef . 
  i do n't care about corn or olive oil because i know there is no chance it contains gmo . 
  if this chance goes higher than 0 i consider my right as a customer to know it . 
   why is n't `` gmo-free '' sufficient for labeling ? 
  from a practical perspective i want to label the exception not the rule . 
  also from the past experiences we know companies can get very creative at deceiving customers ( e.g. 
  chicken liver pate with 40 % pork fat ) if we go for voluntary labeling . 
  a gmo is a variety within a specie ( although some people might argue it 's a different specie ) - and i want to know if that variety is gmo or not ; why is so difficult to accept ? 
  for eggs we actually know how the chicken were raised ; same for `` bio '' food - which must be grown under certain conditions before one can apply the `` bio '' label . 
   they rely heavily on mutagenically bred crops i 'll look into it - do n't consider myself well enough informed to have an opinion ; thanks for the links . 
  my point is : every new gmo is basically a new specie . 
  i am not willing to give a white card to whatever damn thing someone will invent in the future . 
   the foremost anti-gmo activists ... 
  i could n't care less about activists .
