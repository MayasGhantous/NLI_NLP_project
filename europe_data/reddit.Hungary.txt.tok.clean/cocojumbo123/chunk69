  what i do care is my rights as a customer : it is entirely in my right to know what the heck am i buying and eating . 
  and even if gmo labeling will not be mandatory some brands will immediately label their products as `` non-gmo '' and sell them at a premium . 
   this forces the poorest of consumers to pay more for their food to support the poorest of consumers will have a choice just like they have today weather to buy organic or not . 
  by your logic we shall forbid the `` organic '' growth as well ? 
   cross-pollination affects a very small portion of a neighboring field ( less than 1 % ) . 
  cross-pollination is a two-way street . 
  genes from non-gmo fields can also enter gm crops . 
  this causes farmers of gmos to need more pesticide , irrigation , fuel , etc. 
  cross pollination was just an example . 
  what i am worried is the unexpected consequences of introducing ** any ** new specie in the ecosystem . 
  for example , there are the reports of us farmers over using herbicides on gmo crops ( they resist ) leading to super weeds which impact the `` normal '' farmers . 
  also , to my knowledge gmo companies force farmers to buy the seeds from them every year so cross-pollination on the other way is not an issue . 
   well , why does the eu then import tens of millions of tons of america 's gm crops for feedstock ? 
  no idea . 
  what i know is that some farmers choose not to cultivate their lands ( and they get money for that ) and many voices are claiming cheap imports from eu are killing african local production . 
  i would agree with gmos if and only if : - there are extensive studies for each type of gmo - following impact on humans for 20 years ; sorry - a blank statement wo n't cut it . 
  - there is clear labeling on what 's gmo - the gmo producers guarantee the gmos will not impact in any way the existing species ( ie . 
  not even cross pollination ) and will pay whatever needed if contamination happens . 
  also please keep in mind that eu has the problem of over production of agricultural goods so what problem do we actually solve ? 
  can confirm . 
  the government saved me of 3 liberal oppressions today only , and it 's just noon !, 
   it requires unanimous support in the council , and poland/hungary will oppose it . 
  why are you so sure ? 
  opposing , maybe ; vetoing - i seriously doubt it . 
  dragnea is just the tip of the iceberg . 
  hundreds of majors will walk out free as well - in rural romania ( like in hungary ) the major has a big influence the vote - now they can steal with impunity and bribe the ( mostly poor ) villagers with parts of those money . 
  for people wandering what 's the fuzz and indignation : in romania they apply the principle of `` most favorable law '' when sentencing someone . 
  even if this law/executive order is rejected by the parliament , even if it 's valid for only one minute , all felons which fell under its incidence will be freed , all ongoing criminal investigations will be stopped and they can not be restarted . 
  someone please correct me if i am wrong on this ; reposted from removed thread . 
  edit : fuck , the executive order just got published - that 's probably a world record ; thousand corrupts will walk free . 
  few more thousands will not get indicted . 
  this is basically a coup - the executive just pissed big time on the judiciary . 
  extremely sad day for romania - stay strong romaniabros !,

  holly european cattle - this is unfuckingbelievable - romaniabros please keep protesting . 
  none of our parties are anti-eu . 
  even jobbik stopped saying we should leave eu . 
   you still are even in the eu hungary has one of the highest percentage of population who likes eu in the whole eu28, 
  just annex us , please !!!, 
   i ca n't understand how hungarians can stand it ? 
  the statue is also for the victims of ww1 and is in the cemetery where they are presumably buried ( and not in budapest ) and it was donated by some russian foundation . 
  regardless , personally , i am not too happy . 
  pic of said statue : https://4cdn.hu/kraken/image/upload/s--z9dic_m2--/6xqumlikei2q9q6ys.jpeg, 
  hungary approves ~ 650 asylum requests/year . 
  no idea what their color might be . 
  please note that as per our law the request will be rejected if the requester came via a 3 ` rd safe country - with some exceptions . 
   the problem with `` protecting your own culture '' part is , that such a claim is a very fluid one . 
  obviously is a fluid one like anything related to inter-human activities . 
  define love , hate , joy or any feeling . 
  why is so hard to understand that i will first love/protect my family , then my friends then my co-nationals then my co-continentals . 
  it 's all about shared experiences . 
  edit : and one of the top things i like about eu is that it helps creating the said shared experience be it via erasmus or be it via free movement of people . 
  many of them do n't come back ... some of them do . 
  just because it 's hard to define them it does n't mean they do n't exist though . 
   would eu accepting only refugees from active conflicts be considered `` harmful for domestic culture '' ? 
  orban makes a clear distinction between true refugees and economic migrants in the article ; and according to him ( and i agree here ) the difference is in numbers . 
   we 'd easily see as a western , liberal-democratic view , and one , that is closer to his classic self - defence of the `` christian native hungarian '' . 
  if you read it carefully you 'll see he 's rather talking of `` christian - european - hungarian '' culture not ethnicity . 
  which begs the question of : can one have a liberal-democratic view without embracing cultural relativism ? 
  in other words , does acknowledging/celebrating being proud and protecting your own culture has a place in 2017 ? 
  because imo ( could be wrong ) this is what he 's advocating . 
   he just uses the anti eu rhetoric anti brussels is not anti eu just like anti-orban is not anti-hungarian . 
   although i doubt he will pull his country out of the eu . 
  orban never mentioned pulling us out of eu ... quite the contrary . 
  great , can we then post opinion pieces from zerohedge or breitbart ? 
  just post a link to google translate and accept the gratitude of the mobile users . 
  long time no see - how 's cleaning the spam queue going ? 
   i 'll try to wrap up this discussion . 
  you claimed merkel is a leader , i said she is a manager . 
  now , being a manager is not a bad thing - they are great and needed when things are on the course and they need to handle operational issues . 
  however , managers hate uncertainty . 
  on another hand leaders thrive into it : think jobs vs ivy or gates vs balmer . 
  leaders avoid getting their backs at the wall . 
  in our case weather it was 2000 or 3000 people is irrelevant imo ( it was 2000/day in july ) . 
  what matters is that the number was continuously growing for 6 + months , most of them headed to germany and still merkel 's government was surprised in september !!!, 
  for the rest :  you would still have been stuck with a pretty large amount of people you do n't want not more than two days of inventory ~ 15k people - totally manageable - and as i said , take them to the camp at 5 km from austria and show them the way ...  changing the goddamn rules on time . 
  cough , cough - we did/tried to . 
  hungary announced we 're out of dublin in july already . 
   that would be anti catholic . 
  can i make a political statement by burning churches if i do n't like vatican then ? 
   they say they were n't attacking jews , but israel then throw molotovs at the dang embassy !, 
   is / mosque does n't fit allow me to quote you :  if the only israely-ish building you know is a synagogogue the only ** i ** slamic building i know ( that 's like ** i ** in daesh ) is the local mosque . 
  ( btw : you misspelled synagogue ) . 
  disclaimer : i do not advocate burning/attacking any fucking thing , quite the contrary !, 
   i do n't understand what '' justified expression of criticism '' is if they were found guilty of arson ? 
  if i slap you out of the blue , on the street , because i do n't like your face it 's an assault . 
  if i do the same because you belong to a minority it 's a hate crime which in most if not all eu countries has harsher sentences . 
  agree , assuming the attackers did this in the daylight . 
  and after the arson they chain themselves to the fence yelling `` free palestine '' and/or surrender to the police immediately . 
  otherwise , by this logic , the german arsonists attacking refugee shelters are merely making a political statement against merkel , no hate sir , none at all . 
   israeli symbol you know , most people will burn flags ... 
  great , can i burn a catholic church if i 'm pro-condoms ? 
  or a mosque if i 'm anti is ?

  was n't it so that in case of hard brexit the wto does n't come automatically ? 
  ( since uk is part of wto via eu ) . 
  op : grab a can of fluorescent paint and write `` lasciate ogni speranza , voi ch ` entrate '' on top of that,
