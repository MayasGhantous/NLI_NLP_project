  whenever media ( commercials included ) shows a kid is an attempt to influence/manipulate the public opinion - because humans are genetically programmed to care for kids . 
  for example , that 's why the pro-refugees media kept repeating the mantra `` woman and children '' even if they made up less than 20 % . 
  so why do you think the editor made this choice ? 
  to show a random kid sitting on a random rubble ? 
   by selling dollars and buying lira the price and value of lira relative to the dollar will strengthen . 
  i would be surprised if the population holds more usd than speculators or big financial institution . 
  imo if bank of turkey can not hold the exchange rate things will go south quickly . 
  i am old enough to remember life in eastern block  sorry for not being clear ( i did n't attempt to discredit your position btw ) - i just ca n't understand why we 're being chastised for doing same things other do . 
   as a right wing useful idiot who repeats the party line because of how often i see it in my own country . 
  so when you run out of arguments ( and you presented none btw ) you retort to insults ? 
   why i do n't take your personal opinions the fucking constitution is not my personal opinion . 
  article xxii :  ( 1 ) hungary shall strive to ensure decent housing conditions and access to public services for everyone . 
   ( 2 ) the state and local governments shall also contribute to creating decent housing conditions by striving to ensure accommodation for all persons without a dwelling . 
   ( 3 ) in order to protect public order , public security , public health and cultural values , an act or a local government decree may , with respect to a specific part of public space , provide that staying in public space as a habitual dwelling shall be illegal . 
  stating that constitution criminalizes homelessness is a lie . 
  what it says is that the local authorities ( i.e. 
  the city ) can - if they so choose - designate some areas off-limits ( but they ca n't make the whole city off-limits ) . 
  so it 's not depriving them entirely of that option as you suggest ; i see homeless people at metro stations all the time . 
  other countries have the same regulations ( which you call whataboutism ) - so why picking on us ( that 's a holier than thou , do n't you think ? ), 
  you asked if there are enough places currently . 
  at least budapest city claims so - but we did n't had harsh weather yet ( expecting next week ) . 
  there is also an eu funded program ( thanks eu - and i 'm not being sarcastic ) to start providing them with one hot meal/day ( currently this is handled solely by charities ) . 
  registration required to read full article . 
  as you please . 
  i hope at least you find some enjoyment from spreading lies about other people 's countries . 
   `` homelessness will be criminalized ''  in fact , the fundamental law includes an obligation for state and local authorities to strive to provide decent housing and accommodation to all persons . 
  it 's completely false that homelessness will be criminalized . 
  ** there are no provisions for penalties for homelessness ** in the fundamental law . 
   it does include a clause that allows ** local governments ** to prohibit habitual living in certain ** public areas ** on the basis of ** clear and justified criteria ** ( public order , public security , public health and protection of cultural heritage ) . 
  such prohibitions , which do not in any way criminalize homelessness , can be challenged before the constitutional court . 
  can you make the distinction between government and local authorities ( i.e. 
  city council ) before blaming even the somalia famine on orban ? 
  based on your - obviously better than mine - understanding of hungarian situation could you please provide with the punishments applied for homelessness ? 
  can you please point me to examples from other countries where constitution explicitly states the state must provide accommodation to citizens in need ? 
  also could you please then explain how more advanced states like uk , france , italy - to name a few evicted camps of homeless ? 
  heck , dismantling the calais jungle must have been illegal . 
  edit : i see you have us flag , could you explain this as well : http://www.alternet.org/civil-liberties/us-laws-criminalizing-sleeping-public-have-grown-much-60-percent-just-few-years, 
   he tried to censor the internet and tried to make a law banning graduates from migrating outside hungary . 
  sigh . 
  this reminds me of the jokes about radio yerevan , q&a section . 
  `` q : is it true that ivan ivanovici won a car at lottery '' `` a : it is true , except it was not a car but a bicycle and he did n't won but it was stolen from him ''  he tried to censor the internet no he did n't - he tried to add additional taxation for internet . 
   make a law banning graduates from migrating outside hungary . 
  this would be against eu law which is part of hungarian law , you know . 
  what the thing is about is that students receiving state grants for their study have to pay it back if they choose to move abroad . 
   the government has even made it a crime to be homeless no it did n't . 
  i am always amazed on how well non-hungarians know what 's going on here , better than us ... edit :  and authorities are empowered to ban living in certain public spaces , although ** homelessness is not outlawed ** .

  huh - except for the help for relocation were n't all other measures existing/introduced under previous governments ? 
  a german shop here is openly nazi then : http://m.cdn.blog.hu/ho/homar/image/201011/horogkereszt.jpg obviously nobody got offended , those who noticed had a good laugh . 
   your country opposes taking anyone in at all . 
  bit of a difference . 
  my country grants 6-700 people/year refugee status . 
  just not to those coming via 5 safe countries ( except for social cases ) . 
  bit of a difference . 
   hi by the way  i feel this is the beginning of a ** beautiful ** friendship ~ ~ louie ~ ~ h0agh , 
  not all mods do/did - i appreciate it , 
  denmark does the right thing by being a major financial contributor to refugee camps across the globe - which allows them to support much more people abroad than in denmark . 
  also to people complaining about ee `` leaches '' - hi , / u/h0agh - as i said , we oppose a specific type of help , i.e. 
  let everyone who knocks at the door in . 
  ouch . 
  was n't aware of this rule , thanks . 
  also thanks for putting your name at the removal site . 
   link to the newspaper with a translation in the comments . 
  salty : this is a gtranslate link to dr.dk ; from wiki - `` dr -- officially rendered into english as the danish broadcasting corporation -- is denmark 's national broadcasting corporation . '', 
  so how is not on topic or not a newspaper ? 
  but where is the solidarity ? 
  that explains , thanks a lot . 
  why ? 
  does it says something bad on the banner ? 
  ok , i am confused now - on one hand you say no corporate tax . 
  on another you say `` you tax apple usa for the money they received from their hungarian subsidiary '' - are you proposing then a financial tax on capital outflows ? 
  i could have been more confusing indeed  if apple sells stuff in hungary they 'll do that via apple hungary ltd which will get taxed at the corporate rate ( i.e. 
  some money go to the gvnt ) . 
  since you propose removing the corporate tax , that 'll mean less money for hungarian gvnt . 
  that money will go to apple usa and be distributed to apple 's shareholders . 
  you were proposing taxing dividents , i was saying the hungarian state can not tax the foreign shareholders of a us company . 
  is it more clear now ? 
  i actually filled tax returns ) . 
  so for me is something like : i 'm vegetating ( vitality , functioning ) on a couch with a bottle of palinka ( emotional well being ) , already drunk because my so dumped ( supportive relationships ) me but at least the neighbors said `` hi '' in the elevator . 
  ouch , i ate a word . 
  my sentence should have been : shall i pay taxes on dividends in all countries ? 
   there 's no such thing as taxing a corporation what is corporate tax then ? 
   and why ca n't you tax the dividends ? 
  let 's say i 'm john smith , proud us citizen and owner of a few apple shares . 
  shall i be taxed on dividends by all countries on the planet that apple sells stuff ? 
  edit : a word, 
   use dividends and capital gains progressive taxes . 
  trouble is that those get taxed elsewhere - we can tax corporations for profits done in hungary but we ca n't tax them for dividends in us . 
  the first one was a social necessity and it turned out rather well . 
  second one is debatable - weather companies should contribute in getting out of the crisis or that 's entirely up to the population . 
   no we ca n't . 
  again , due to legal reasons . 
  so anyone from the planet who gets to germany ( including ee beggars ) are entitled to get a decent life on your taxmoney ??? 
   deporting people back into countries stuck in civil war ? 
  great idea !, 
  i was n't talking of legit asylum seekers but of economic migrants . 
  20 million syrians are less scary than 1.5 billion north africans . 
   well , what do you expect ? 
  we can not simply leave the people in the streets with no money of course you can - you are not a nanny dealing with kids - people should know that if they get to germany illegally they will get a big nothing . 
  otherwise no redistribution deal will ever work , nor the influx of economic migrants ever stop .
