  they might be crap proposals but still exist . 
  great reply btw . 
  thaaaanks a lot , 
   that is not a plan . 
  so let 's distribute everyone is a plan but this is not ? 
  - there are some aspects which are not part of schenge . 
  how about this : http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34324319 is it a plan ? 
   nope , all of that is `` pay another european country to deal with the problem '' . 
  i read it like we 'll do almost everything except for accepting the forced distribution . 
    i think you have a lower bar of what a plan or an opinion is . 
  possible . 
  so what is the difference in your opinion ? 
  by schengen 2.0 i meant this : http://abouthungary.hu/news-in-brief/here-it-is-hungarys-10-point-action-plan-for-the-management-of-the-migration-crisis/ - you can not really say v4 had no plan . 
   and `` effective solidarity '' is paying greece to be a refugee cam it was a bit more though :  according to this concept , should normal circumstances deteriorate , a ` tailored solidarity contribution mechanism ' would be triggered under which member states could contribute to the alleviation of the situation not only by relocating asylum-seekers but also by providing financial contribution to the affected member state , supporting monetarily a dedicated migration fund , or increasing contributions to the european asylum support office or the european border and coast guard to name a few suggestions . 
  do you know how can i separate two quotes ???? 
   v4 ca n't actually have an opinion on anything outside their tiny little world i respectfully disagree - it 's just that opinion is usually ignored . 
  it almost looks like erdo has a cue ball with two values `` harboring terrorists '' and `` fascists '', 
   where is the v4 proposal on solving the refugee crisis . 
   answer : there is none . 
  maybe you should read a bit before going to absolutes . 
  v4 had a proposal in sept 2015 then it was schengen 2.0 and more recently it was czech proposal on effective solidarity . 
   they would have a policy on syrian war , or libyan government or stabilizing central africa . 
  orban declared on fri that he is supporting an eu military intervention in libya . 
  for example . 
   you know why ? 
  there was no time . 
  time for what ? 
  the deadline is still september 2017 - whole two years later . 
  yes , western leaders wanted really hard to show their population they are doing `` something '' . 
  we talk a lot of v4 being populist - fine . 
  but there is much less talk on how a convenient target v4 is for western politicians - `` yes , refugee crisis will be solved if v4 would do their fair part '' - type of messages . 
   because the strategy of the v4 v4 was n't really making any noise between 2012 and 2015 , i do n't know what you mean . 
  absolutely true , but that alone wo n't be enough - i mean greek/latin was the language of the elites for millennia and still did n't became lingua france . 
  as long as 90 % of blockbuster movies and top chart songs are in english , it 'll stay lingua franca, 
  background : bkk commissioned t-systems for the e-ticketing solution . 
  the result would make even a junior programmer curl in fetal position wishing he was never born . 
  for example the amount of money to be paid was checked in the browser and passed to the server as parameter . 
  for example : bkk.hu?ticket _ type = monthly?amount = 9500 what this `` 1337 hax0r '' did is to manually edit the 9500 to 50 . 
  and this idiots in charge instead of shutting down the system and thank the guy sent the police instead . 
  many people are reading on mobile ... 
   does it ? 
  what experience ? 
  there is/was a proposal for permanent relocation : https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-migration/proposal-implementation-package/docs/proposal_for_regulation_of_ep_and_council_establishing_a_crisis_relocation_mechanism_en.pdf, 
  hungarian minority in romania, 
  what did you ate ??? 
  that 's important !, 
  ( i hope it 's not pickled herring ), 
  damn , my favorite vacation spot is omis/duce/split - finger crossed the firefighters will manage to contain the fire . 
  in 70s there were massive state loans - at least in hungary and romania - it 's easy to grow the gdp based on loans/consumption for a few years - just look at greece . 
  what i do n't understand is the following : world and dog and the kitchen sink know that setting a refugee limit is not possible due to constitution and international treaties ( nb . 
  not even orban tried to do it ) . 
  then why is it so that the german opposition asks of it and why merkel is n't just plainly replaying `` that would be illegal/unconstitutional '' ? 
  thanks a lot ( also to / u/marktplatz ) - and what is happening to the rejected people - do they get deported ? 
  also do rejected applicants receive any benefits ? 
   they do n't have a residence permit that allows them to stay in germany forever how about subsidiary protection ? 
  ~ ~ do i understand it right that majority of rejected asylum seekers get that ? ~ ~ edit : nope my understanding was wrong, 
  what do you mean by productivity ? 
  ( widgets/hour or wrt gdp ) . 
  also you mean wages are growing faster or slower than productivity ? 
  since ee joined the eu there were two periods of economic growth and one severe depression . 
  besides , the wages ( at least ) doubled since then ( if i remember right ) so what 's the problem ? 
   i do n't exactly know what kind of response you want to that . 
  i just answered your question , no need for an answer - btw , check out bulgaria , boy they are dependent ...  all countries are mainly in for their own profit here , every single one is willing to let ukraine go if the price is high enough . 
  yup , but we do n't claim moral superiority nor we have a claim of leading the eu or speaking in the name of it while pursuing our narrow economical interest . 
   that 's not the point and also a misleading argument i should had formulated it better - which country is colluding more with russia , us or germany ? 
  http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-17-1571_en.htm  `` not gifting '' is completely neutral . 
  so ukrainians will freeze in a neutral matter . 
  but hey , let 's look at the positives : if ukraine collapses due to extreme german greed i do n't think v4 will object taking their fair share of ukrainian refugees ^ butthemajoritywillstillgoto ^ germany, 
  we 're arguing on details ( but i 'll reply to those as well ) . 
  based on facts which country would you say wants closer economic relationships with russia post crimea invasion ? 
  us or germany ? 
  is ns2 inline with the eu directive of reducing dependency from russia ? 
  yes or no ? 
  is ns2 helping with achieving another eu goal of having a common energy market ? 
  if yes , how ? 
  for the rest :  they simply said that they will oppose it . 
  good news is that ec is doing germany 's whoring and came up with a version where no eu member will loose . 
   i do n't think so . 
  minsk word is not present in the article . 
  us senate sanctions is . 
   `` must increasingly rely on russian gas '' part does n't make sense . 
  agree for poland , not for the rest of transit countries  nothing is `` stolen '' if from german pow it can be seen as `` gifting '' then from a non-german pow can be seen as `` stealing '' . 
   inaccurate . 
  there are other european countries taking part in this . 
  the countries along the route of ns2 were also contacted . 
  did you asked the opinion of the ones who will not win financially as well ? 
   simply not accurate . 
  all our ministers insist on fulfilling the minsk agreement before sanctions are lifted . 
  i do n't think the author refers to minsk but the us senate one . 
   this does n't even make sense . 
  poland has a pipe with russia , also some countries on the path ( e.g. 
  slovakia are to lose a lot in transit fees ) . 
   has no obligation to `` gift '' ns2 is then `` stealing '' ... 
  this is some mental gimnastics wrt germany vs russia . 
  so germany whom pushes for ns2 , opposes nato bases in poland , not to mention siemens , basf & co are somehow helping ukraine and poland whereas us whose senate just voted new sanctions , wants to have lng ( bad for russia ) are somehow the bad guys . 
  wrt polska - this article gives me the feeling ( feel free to disagree ) that germany wants to have the cake and eat it too . 
  what do you expect if you bash your ally and force down his throat things he obviously does n't want ? 
   brussels capital region : 16,8 % that 's a bit odd - capitals are usually richer and with less unemployment than some small village in the middle of nowhere, 
  yup , that 's the same stated reason why orban bought back some banks - so that when the next crisis hits we do n't see capital flight and crediting freeze . 
  nah , let 's make it pink .
