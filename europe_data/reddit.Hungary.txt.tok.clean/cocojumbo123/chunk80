  on reddit ), 
   idk why orban does n't play stupid like that he is n't !, 
  it 's all about internal politics because at the end of the day , orban gets elected by hungarians . 
  in march 2016 , orban was already speaking of `` dangers of migration '' - we were having 100 max/day . 
  opposition accused him of inventing topics . 
  two months later opposition is with their pants down ( with 3-5k migrants crossing our borders ) - orban was right and it was an issue - now , make sure he 's gon na ride this to the next electoral victory . 
  what 's a dd ? 
  you also said you are engaged to an irish guy btw ... :p, 
   where did you know that you said you want to be a lawyer in a comment ~ one year ago . 
   who are you ? 
  i 'm your friendly local vampire . 
  please select the cooking level : under rare or rare :p, 
   it was easy you still wrote once `` a-ti '' :p joke aside big congrats , also your english is better than 98 % of high school graduates ; still want to be a lawyer ? 
  funny thing is that romanian constitution says its a `` national country '' - does n't that mean everyone living there is romanian ? 
  unrelated : how was the erettsegi/high school graduation exam ? 
  agree ; another thing which rustles my jimmies is handling of the deficit . 
  if you are small ( ee , greece ) - suck it up and stay below 3 % even it means huge social costs . 
  if you are france ... 
  if we are to talk of fairness , ec should start infringement procedure against ** all ** countries who did n't fulfilled their quota . 
  that means pretty much everyone except uk , denmark ( opt-out ) and maybe austria , germany and sweden . 
  if we are to talk about following the rules , hungary and slovakia sued at ecj - as is our legal right to do - so is the ec saying they 'll not wait for the ecj 's decisions ? 
  should ecj decide against hungary we shall certainly take our 1200 people . 
  so any person who criticizes romania is a bozgor ? 
  got it !, 
  so if i quote your ex-ex president `` the ducks come from the trucks '' does that makes me a good romanian ? 
   and people wonder why we hate hungarians/bozgors i do wander indeed since based on parent 's posting history he is romanian . 
  why do you blame hungarians ? 
   the unique combination of dna would disappear forever true . 
  and ? 
  ( i mean just because something is unique it does n't necessarily makes it special ) . 
  here : http://imgur.com/gallery/f0iu0xe  seriously , better donate that money to an orphanage . 
   its not an organism . 
  neither is an ovule , nor a fetus . 
  also the sperm delivers exactly half of baby 's dna . 
   you , as a person , was a fetus at some point . 
  yes , and the fetus was two cells at some point . 
  then extract them in a gentle way and good luck growing them in vitro . 
  then by all means remove them alive from the mothers who do n't want them and grow them . 
   a fetus does good luck creating humans in vitro . 
  i hope you do n't masturbate - that 'll be a lot of potential kids going down the drain . 
  germany finally got some points !!!!, 
  if they convince them to reunite it 'll be a plus for the humanity , 
  that 's not fair - if we have eurovision kids we shall have one for seniors as well . 
  you have italy - they had a hairy thing, 
  last time an eurovision song got stuck in my head was germany - lena - satellite, 
  lmao , yes , how did you know ? 
  new new kids on the block or something . 
  off i am to relisten master of puppets !!!, 
  - need some metal, 
  bromania : did your german president made yodelling mandatory ? 
  i like cyprus 's song , those drums are cool - although i would had preferred a bit more metalish guitars . 
  looks a bit like xena, 
  your mandatory training !, 
  wow 450 k viewers on youtube, 
  they 'll be allowed even with border controls if they say the magic word ~ ~ open sesame ~ ~ i request asylum . 
  it does look like a target at a quick glance , 
  i think is a typo indeed , to my knowledge is 5 % . 
  in case anyone wandering why orban will win the next election ( hint : is not because he 's that much loved as many assume )  while most opposition parties have supported the protests , they remain deeply divided . 
  of nine centrist , left-wing , and liberal-leaning opposition parties , five would fail to meet the minimum 4 percent threshold to get into parliament . 
  and the largest opposition group in hungary remains the far-right jobbik party , which enjoys the support of 14 percent of the population and has been the main beneficiary of orb\u00e1n 's declining popularity, 
  i do n't know of other countries , but in hungary all cash machines are nowadays connected to tax authority via internet ( we had issues in the past with people manipulating their cash machine ) ; when it was introduced , the tax authority went controlling and asked for the check then immediately checking whether it showed in their database . 
  this is largely credited for whitening a large part of our economy . 
  anecdote : i am lucky enough to have lived for 6 months in each finland , us ( california ) and china . 
  while in finland - i never had cultural shocks ( except when meeting sober people from oulu ) . 
  in china - plenty of cultural shocks , no need to expand in this context . 
  in us ... let 's just say that i felt myself home upon landing in frankfurt and i saw boobs . 
  yes , boobs !, 
  on a magazine , in the airport . 
  because for 6 months there were all this ads on tv on girls gone wild which would raise their shirts and show ... clouds !, 
  i swear , at least in cali , woman do n't have boobs , they have clouds . 
  no offence , but did you read the article ? 
  granted , it 's click baity and not so well written but this has nothing to do with soros . 
  why not ? 
  - it 's a really bad system - it distorts the will of the electorate and it makes it very hard for new parties to appear . 
  if it contains something damaging it will delegitimize his presidency also on monday . 
  bbc reports they the hack happened few weeks back , so why now ? 
  i am not saying you are wrong , just guessing like everyone else . 
   the leaked files were obtained several weeks ago by hacking personal and professional email accounts of several officials of the movement , '' it said in a statement . 
  ok , this is even more interesting . 
  if the hack happened several weeks back why do it now when it wo n't influence the election . 
  hmm , interesting tweet from wikileaks :  who benefits ? 
  timing of alleged dump is too late to hit vote but will surely be used to boost hostility to russia & intelligence spending . 
  is the french press allowed to mention the leaks ( content included ) till the elections ? 
   wikileaks has an agenda this was not leaked by wikileaks . 
  it 's too late to change the result of the election imo . 
  it 'll take days if not weeks until they go through all e-mails . 
  until then he 'll be president . 
  if anything i am very much against closing of ceu and i do n't remember commenting wrt soros himself , neither positive nor negative . 
  he 's right in the sense that my government doubled down and is using both soros and brussels as boogie . 
  if eu would n't exist it should be invented . 
  it 's just so damn convenient for some politicians to use it as a scapegoat . 
  imo , eu will be used as boogie man in uk for at least couple of decades more . 
  this is a very good point actually , since probably only government fans will fill it in ; if not for mobilizing at least to have a cheap advertising channel . 
  i am not disagreeing with you but it is free money if you do n't consider where it comes from . 
  and whereas i agree with you that 'll mean more taxes , it does n't necessarily need to be taxes on people but on corporations or consumption . 
  stay with me for a second : 20-21 ` st century are characterized by over increased ** productivity ** . 
  in other words , plus value . 
  now we only have to figure it out where this plus value is created and where is accrued . 
  the reason so many people find basic income hard is because it 'll basically mean a departure from the protestant work ethic ( not that there 's something wrong with it ) . 
  i am certainly glad i ditched my tv 5 years ago ...
