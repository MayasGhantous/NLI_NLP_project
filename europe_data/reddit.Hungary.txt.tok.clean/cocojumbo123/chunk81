  2 ` nd reply . 
  allow me to explain - elon musk is a rounding error in the great scheme of things - shall we deny one hundred million people basic income if we know there is a billionaire among them ? 
  i am surprised it 's only 68 % actually . 
  i mean if you are asked `` would you like free money '' how many people would say no ? 
  that 's also a reason why many countries ca n't have referendums on monetary policies . 
  personally , i think it 's doable , just damn hard . 
  yes and yes, 
  did mormon missionaries inspired their uniform ? 
  this is incomplete - you did n't put the plural forms . 
  probably helsinki committee, 
  consider yourself cursed !, 
   ultimate human desire which is to be free * in germany * ftfy, 
   you may as well identify as an apache attack helicopter i 'd really like to meet such a person , 
  nope - this is the beginning of an infringement procedure . 
  it can end with hefty fines or not releasing funds until the infringing law is corrected . 
   the costs of roaming to every client , roaming does n't cost a thing . 
  operators lose revenue but do n't have increased opex . 
  ... i worked for many years as a telecom engineer . 
  why would anyone call ivanka beast ? 
  c'mon , she 's not that ugly . 
   this anti-russia/pro-russia dichotomy there was a recent survey on attitudes of hungarians vs eu and russia . 
  more than 50 % of orban 's supporters support both getting closer to eu ** and ** at the same time getting closer to russia . 
  i guess the campaign strategists are scratching their heads really hard now . 
   he just said `` not in my backyard '' . 
  he said not in my backyard after v4 proposal was rejected and the eu consensus was `` let everyone in then distribute them '' . 
  kind reminder that hungary was also supposed to be one of the hotspots which we would n't had liked . 
   orban did n't offer any proposals to create a european border security you mean like this : https://visegradpost.com/en/2016/04/19/orbans-schengen-2-0-proposition/, 
  i start by noting you provide exactly ** zero ** evidence on your list of alternative facts . 
  feel free to provide sources if you find any , lol . 
   was talking about before he closed the borders . 
  before that , he let hundreds of thousands strand , strand where ? 
  at no moment in time there were `` hundreds of thousands '' in hungary ** at the same time **  without germany and austria , there would have been thousands dead on the streets of budapest and hungary as a whole care to elaborate who would had died and why ? 
  i also suggest you read this to refresh your memory : http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/2016-08/refugees-open-border-policy-september-2015-angela-merkel/komplettansicht  orban , again , bussed masses of people to the austrian border make up your mind were they stranded or bussed ? 
   his party was not elected by a majority if by majority you mean 50 % on the list votes you are right . 
  his party got 44.8 % of list votes the next coalition got 25.5 - he would have had a comfy majority in parliament even if he would n't had changed the system .

  no offense , but you are very wrong on almost everything . 
   how a critical look at oneself leads to advancement it depends on what is the purpose of the critical look . 
  when the purpose of the critique is purely deconstructionist without proposing much in place there wo n't be so much advancement . 
  fun fact : he never uses the term `` illiberal democracy '' in his speech , he talks of `` illiberal state '' . 
  he also states :  we needed to state that a democracy is not necessarily liberal . 
  just because something is not liberal , it still can be a democracy and  it does not deny foundational values of liberalism , as freedom , etc. 
  and  ... one that will of course still respect values of christianity , freedom and human rights . 
  those duties and values that i enumerated should be fulfilled and be respected and for people unaware of the context : it was mostly economical . 
  i ca n't really argue with you interpreting things in whichever way you chose - did you read the infamous speech ? 
  also call me optimist but any comparisons with turkey are very far fetched imo . 
  except that he meant something else by illiberal democracy - read his speech . 
  how much do you wan na pay ? 
  i 'll gladly import romania 's anti-corruption chief in exchange . 
  it 's not more complicated for an european one - it just takes time and a lot of audits . 
  also ceu has ~ 10-20 % hungarian students aka 100-200 people/year . 
  i would n't really consider them as competition . 
   unfair advantage over other hungarian universities unfair in which sense ? 
   if soros wants to have a university in hungary , he can found it just like everyone else he has one already - kke . 
   circumventing the hungarian law yes , the law which was changed 2 weeks ago ... 
  problem is 80 % of the students get only us diplomas . 
  this means not only ceu is registered in us but also that they are ** accredited ** to give us diplomas . 
  any university in europe - could apply for accreditation in us but is a long and tough process . 
  why should it be hungary 's concern who does usda accredits ? 
   rrom is only used in romania nope , we use roma in hungary as well nb . 
  the hungarian `` a '' is a different vowel than the romanian `` a '' - romania is written `` rom\u00e1nia '' so noone would confuse them   i hope is not the same reason why they are so obsessed with calling every gipsy a romanian even when they are not . 
  here 's the bad news : western people could n't care less about ee views on citizenship/nationality/ethnicity . 
  brits and others will use what 's written in the passport and wo n't ask hey , are you a true romanian/hungarian/eean or a gipsy ? 
  was there some major corruption event which caused the protest or the social tensions reached the boiling point ? 
  afaik gypsies always called themselves rrom in their language . 
  so it 's not like they redefine themselves . 
  it 's the same as when we call ourselves magyar whereas the rest of the planet calls us hungarians . 
  and sorry , i am not buying the idea that someone decided to call them roma just to confuse the rest of the planet . 
  and less loud than the spanish . 
  i ca n't think of any negative stereotype either . 
   in romania they call themselves tigans ( gypsies ) you sure ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romani_people#romani_usage imo is just an unfortunate coincidence , not a conspiracy, 
   all eastern european nations have negative feelings about the eu . 
  ~ ~ huh ? 
  eu is viewed more favorably in ee than in we ~ ~ edit : moral of the story read the whole post before commenting . 
  we allow ~ 60-70 daily to apply for asylum . 
  you are absolutely correct but in this case we have conflicting laws & regulations - i think the detention or not is not a law but a regulation , otherwise we 'd be sued out of existence . 
  on one hand we are supposed to protect schengen - on another the current interpretation of the regulation is that if someone comes at the border and says `` i am a refugee '' we 're supposed to fingerprint and take a picture then put him in an open camp . 
  good luck finding them later . 
  after bataclan we actually got some flack for allowing some of the attackers to go via hungary . 
  so we shall not detain anyone but not allow them to pass either . 
  makes perfect sense . 
  at the same time the eu citizens have to wait 4-5 hours at the border because the commission is out of touch with reality . 
  and while 're we 're at rules : those people should n't be sent to hungary in the first place , but to greece . 
   he likes to use eu as a boogeyman not the eu but the european commission ( juncker/brussels ) . 
  concluding that being anti commission is anti-eu is like saying that being anti-orban is anti hungarian . 
   and he started a campaign to change that which one ? 
  the anti brussels one is ongoing since 2-3 years . 
  ginious is the right spelling in glorious balkans !, 
  serious answer , also for / u/anarchotech : orban repeatedly said hungary 's place is in europe . 
  he never , ever even remotely mentioned the possibility of a huxit . 
  heck not even jobbik ( which were burning custom made flamable eu flags few years back ) does n't want it . 
  in politics you will never win if you try to push the electorate into what they do n't want - 70 % of hungary 's population has a good or very good opinion of eu , the trust in eu is higher than the trust in our government . 
  this being told - i see a lot of binary thinking here , some comments even implying that the only possible way the net money receivers are allowed to behave is in absolute obeity . 
  otherwise we 're ungrateful asses , blah , blah . 
  orban is criticizing some proposals of the european commission . 
  that does n't means he wants out . 
  criticism is currently related to : forced migrant relocation plans , price of utilities , the proposal on mandatory minimum wages for ee people . 
  this can be all legitimate concerns . 
  what is distasteful is that he is using this issue in a propaganda way - my guess is to win the next elections .
