  obviously it 's much easier to conclude that merkel suddenly lost her minds and wants to destroy germany because she is disgusted by it . 
  frankly i 'd pick her over any other politician who 'd flash his undies with the national flag if that 'll bring some votes . 
  i do n't like merkel but the interpretations of this gesture are moronic . 
  what does it have to do with europe ? 
  hungary - wizzair , paprika from szeged ( szegedi paprika ) , pick, 
  kids this days know only manele : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6sv4dqnzda anyway , nu doar mortii stiu cum e sa mori ... or something . 
  try brisca . 
  putin is love , putin is life !, 
  i also speak english ... as of romanian , was n't it scoala ardeleana campaigning for latinization leading to sentences like `` o bella mea ce bella esti pe zi ce trece te belesti '' ? 
  comrades , my head does n't hurt enough due to the new color schema . 
  why do we even have the blue and dark red ? 
  the only true color is russian red !, 
  we need more red !, 
  also glorious cccp symbols are not present enough !, 
  also wtf mods : no picture of vladimir ? 
  please revise your attitude !, 
  also mandatory : bursuc , barza , viezure , \u00e9rted attila , pui de dac ? 
  anyway , i was quoting romania 's dearest president ( according to number of votes ) : https://ro.wikiquote.org/wiki/ion_iliescu, 
  google translate gets better and better :p for example : pus astfel in lumina , recursul la universalitate nu eludeaza meandrele concretului . 
  eng : in this light , the recourse to universality is not eluding the complexities of the beton . 
   oh , come on . 
  read the thread . 
  your wish is my command . 
   that 's what happens when you fight and pay tribute to the ottomans for 500 years , only to be conquered by the empire next door which takes away your biggest and most productive chunk of the country , removing any means of actually getting back on your feet after the ottoman clusterfuck . 
  so romanians were less literate because they were busy fighting ottomans while hungary was conquering romania ?? 
   no offence , this is a bit silly . 
   he said that austro-hungarian empire relocated ethnic hungarians and germans in those parts of the country ( which is true ) , and that they were more educated than the local population ( which is also true , and not a tad insulting ) . 
  the map is from 1930 - that is 70 years after small union and 15 years after the big one . 
  blaming it on hungarians/germans is nonsense . 
  that 's a shitload of time to catch-up at least in moldova-valachia . 
  the word colonist itself is insulting , not the argument . 
  yes , the hungarian government site is a piece of propaganda and in this post you do a much better job on debunking it than this shitty guardian article !!!, 
    like a few years ago when jobbik ... 
  i think actually the jobbik piece comparing food for migrants vs food in hospitals was far more powerful . 
  i will abstain from voting so that the referendum will not be valid btw . 
  tucatu-te-as :p, 
   he did literally say this - bolded , no less no , he was quoting wikipedia , the mother of all knowledge :p anyway , mea culpa , i did n't read up enough to see that , you are right and i will edit my post . 
   i do n't find the term `` colonist '' to be an insult , really i said it 's insulting for hungarians in romania ; you are obviously free to interpret it as you wish . 
  i guess dacians were also colonists right ? 
  or was romania a bareland when they arrived ? 
   you actually argue that there was no population inside the carpathian basin in year 900 ~ ~ he did n't said that ~ ~ and frankly not many people in hungary believe it either . 
  edit : / u/vortalwombat actually quoted that but at the same time there was not much statehood in transylvania . 
  also calling hungarians and germans `` colonists '' just because they happened to be there for only 1000 years is a tad insulting . 
  i mean , why do n't you call romans/italians colonists as well if you love so much continuity argument ? 
  respectfully suggesting you read the rules of / r/europe and provide a english translation as well before one of our trigger happy mods takes note . 
   first time seeing a romanian `` redditor '' / r/romania is that way proudly boosting 28 245 members , 
  oh , c'mon - this is a fairly malicious article . 
  from the whole website they cherry picked the most debatable topic , everything else gets barely a mention . 
  the hungarian page has no reference altogether - guardian is quoting without linking a source . 
  and finally it manages to contradicts itself :  and a ticking clock supposedly representing a migrant entering ** europe ** every 12 seconds  however , according to official hungarian police statistics , that figure inflates the current reality on the ** hungarian border ** by over 6,000 % . 
  because one can enter to europe only via hungary . 
  as i said many times , i dislike orban but that does n't mean i will agree to a shitty article . 
  `` m\u0103-ta '' has cratima . 
  kids this days ... 
  by this logic uk also invaded us whereas spain and portugal invaded south america ... 
  i 'm not a big merkel fan on immigration issues but she did a lot of turns . 
  here 's the lates one : http://www.usapoliticstoday.com/another-angela-merkel-u-turn-refugees-must-all-leave-germany-once-isis-is-defeated/ the only one she had n't done ( and probably never will ) is publicly denouncing #willcommenskultur but in politics actions are louder than words if you are willing to listen . 
  i love your metaphor but i slightly disagree . 
  this is a union where the richest passenger takes over the wheel and insists we can totally handle the collision with the iceberg . 
  luckily she starts making an u-turn . 
  question is if the u-turn will be fast enough to avoid the iceberg . 
  i 'm on the mobile so ca n't find the link but was n't it so that in september they basically closed a border closing with serbia because everyone got arrested ? 
  naturally the question is how you will enforce this ? 
  i mean you have trouble with deportations ... 
  my apologies - i did n't meant to be mocking - just show things in perspective - humans tend to exaggerate the unknown . 
   but some muslims have the security passes for a nuclear plant in belgium , think that 's safe ? 
  just because it has atoms it does n't mean it 's gon na boom . 
  seriously - it 's not like in the movies - that one can manage to cause a nuclear reaction in an atomic plant bypassing the multiple automatic safety mechanisms . 
  we 've been planning a trip to us for about a year now , and we were planning on doing it in may . 
  however , due to the recent terrorist attacks in boston , we 've been talking about cancelling our tickets ( cancelling all of our tickets will cost $ 1000 ) and going to greece . 
  is this worth it / a good choice ? 
  should we still go because of the relatively low chances of an attack happening where we are ? 
  oh boy , this is dumb . 
  what shall google do for a result which has to be removed globally due to france 's decision and has to be kept globally due to a potential `` freedom of speech '' us decision . 
  basically the court tries to force national internets ... which is not how the things work . 
  joining late to the party , poles are our brothers . 
  happy common friendship day , we shall do it more often , 
   an attack that may in itself be a strawman , but not an ad hominem . 
  hmm , guess you are right . 
   mass immigration has n't been a thing since the 1960 's . 
  my interpretation is that he is referring to exactly that . 
  however the integration part was ongoing . 
   the use of the term , population replacement   one of the largest population replacement exercises in history this happens is n't it ? 
   while offering no solution themself . 
  i 'm with you on this one . 
  but to be fair both left and right are only bashing something without saying solutions . 
  also i guess he means a solution which works . 
  also if you read analysis of situation in belgium pretty much everyone also blames politicians . 
  you do n't need to insult someone to have ad hominem . 
  it 's enough to dismiss what he said by calling him biased . 
  or claiming he used a strawman therefore his arguments being invalid  i also see no muslim bashing here btw but again two people might have different conclusions . 
  ok , which of the following sentences you disagree with :  among other things the fact that we are living with the consequences of an immigration and ` integration ' fantasy which should have been abandoned years ago . 
   instead our governments have kept pretending that the weakening of europe 's external borders and the erosion of its internal borders happening at the same time as one of the largest population replacement exercises in history could have no tangible effects on our continent 's future . 
   in fact nobody looks to anyone else 's model anymore . 
  because all of the ` models ' failed . 
  so here we are -- stuck with a problem our politicians have given us and to which they have no answers . 
  sorry to say but if the article is strawmen then your post is an ad hominem . 
   reader to the conclusion that all muslims are bad i prefer the ad literam conclusion : politicians lived and live in la-la-land . 
  very bad timing due to ongoing attacks in belgium . 
  i learnt touch typing on an english keyboard , never learnt diacritics .
