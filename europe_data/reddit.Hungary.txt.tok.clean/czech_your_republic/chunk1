how will your ` peace ' hold up once russia decides to keep crawling west into other european countries ? 
  i do n't think even he knows what his policies are . 
  well . . putin can prepare the champagne i guess . 
  i just worry what it means for europe . 
  will we grow closer and strengthen ourself as an independent entity , or are we looking at some dark , dark ages to come ? 
   i went ahead heh, 
  it was repealed . 
  hungary also likes you , bros. 
  meanwhile our dear comrades keep expanding their nuclear arsenal and improving their missiles . 
  no stabby the toe, 
  yeah , here in the east we are a bit more sceptical about nato 's protection , when russia 's pretty much free to do as she pleases . 
  are we getting the gang back together ? 
  the russians really need to stop reading so much tom clancy . 
  i guess you never had a real italian leather shoe ; the quality , design and materials used are way better than a chinese one 's . 
  sure , the logo itself boosts the price , but you pay for the quality . 
  it does n't solve anything . 
  it just makes the mess caused by one country affect other member states ; and now they are trying to blackmail us into mitigating the effects of their stupidity . 
  thanks , but no thanks , merkel ; you called down the thunder , now reap the whirlwind . 
  russia could n't get away with that much . 
  if they 'd invade an eu country the very least the west would do is to completely cut off trade with russia , essentially crippling it . 
  they can invade non-nato/eu members with a slap on the wrist , but if they 'd dare to mess with the aforementioned ones , it would be all-out war or nothing , due to the nature of globalised trade/economy . 
  what 's up with psychotic dictators always trying to invade europe around the time of the olympics ? 
  do you realise how ridiculous you sound ? 
  how do you propose we `` save ourselves from corruption '' ? 
  i love how everyone seem to be suddenly an expert regarding my country . 
  because 1 : as much as western media wants you to believe , he 's not a dictator ( though he has such tendencies ) ; 2 : it would be illegal as fuck ; 3 : he 's still the best we have unfortunately , as the alternatives are way worse , which tells more about the state of the whole political system in hungary . 
  and all it achieved was ridicule from the populace and some pretty amusing parodied billboards in response . 
  the `` greater hungary '' stuff is only popular with a small minority , who want to escape into their delusions , while at the same time blaming the eu for their problems . 
  the majority of the population just wants to be well off , or at least have a liveable wage . 
  the majority also distances themselves from politics as much as they can . 
  i do n't think that jobbik will get any higher % . 
  orb\u00e1n pretty much broken their base with the migrant-business , making one of the biggest appeals of the party moot . 
  now they are pretty much only voted for by the `` ultra-hungarians '' and some of the rural populace in villages with roma-problems . 
  i do n't think any educated hungarian takes these kind of messages from orb\u00e1n seriously . 
  hell , they 're usually just parodied and ridiculed . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/match_of_the_century_ ( 1953_england_v_hungary_football_match ), 
  having a look at africa , sa , or the middle-east tells otherwise . 
  huh , did n't expect southern europe to have such low fertility . 
  i thought the whole catholicism thing mixed with easygoingness and promiscuity would produce a much higher rate , despite the economic factors . 
  also , i 'm curious if france 's and britain 's high numbers have more to do with immigrants ' birth rate . 
  they mean removing it by eating the delicious kebab . 
  it 's god telling you that the uk 's falling apart,

  i know the dm was always somewhat right-wing , but when did it become straight up alt-right level ? 
  or was it always like this ? 
  yes and no . 
  russia completely controls its media and the narrative anyway , so whatever happens , they could spin it against ukraine . 
  i think that barring the russian singer for entering illegally is better for ukraine , because it at least shown some backbone . 
  the only reasons to watch eurovision are the international drama and banter . 
  though they censor the booing and such nowadays , which sucks . 
  / r/europe has a really strong leftist bias , if you have n't noticed yet . 
  yep , anything political , or internationally significant is usually met with disinterest in hungary . 
  people are just apathetic/ignorant for this kind of stuff here . 
  well , it can be pretty difficult to handle such a large sheet . 
  kingdom of alright britain, 
  plus , the europeans working/thinking about working in england may find scotland a more attractive choice now . 
  and if they 'd dare touch the embassy , there would be one hell of an international shitstorm . 
  did n't russia say that it wo n't participate this year because they 're butthurt about ukraine winning ? 
  or even that it 'll start it 's own ruskievision or something ? 
  the proletariat shall rise again !, 
  [ almost everyone ] ( http://pbs.twimg.com/media/cpkyvsmwoaadh3u.png:large ), 
  russians ? 
  you really think russia would let ukraine join nato or even the eu ? 
  maybe the slavs mistook it for vodka . 
  no , we have plenty , but there are only 3 large ones - jobbik ( the far-right one ) , the socialist coalition ( whatever name they 'll run by this time ) and fidesz , the incumbent party . 
  plus there 's also the green party and some other tiny ones , but they are way smaller then the other 3 and they only appeal to a small number of voters . 
  easier said than done . 
  unless you become a bootlicker of the party in power , or you 're a relative/friend , you have no realistic chance to rise in politics . 
  and again , people here are apathetic and only care about their own self-interests . 
   how could they elect this guy ? 
  because the only 2 alternatives are a far-right , anti-eu , even more pro-russia party , and an openly corrupt socialist coalition that hate each others ' guts and have dug a 1000 feet grave for themselves when they were in power . 
  so orb\u00e1n is the best we have unfortunately . 
  other than that , political apathy is extremely widespread around here . 
  talking about politics is just something we do n't really do , other than complaining from time to time . 
  plus , a lot of people sympathise with putin because of his anti-liberal stance . 
  it 's called `` intervention '' nowadays . 
  and tourists in stylish green . 
  those old pagan traditions die slowly . 
  trump scrapping the tpp and moving towards isolationism ( and pissing off china at every opportunity ) pretty much ensured that china will be the # 1 economic powerhouse soon enough . 
  it would be wise to strengthen trade ties with them . 
  facts and written records apparently do n't matter anymore , when you can simply deny them . 
  and as usual , the rest of europe 's sandwiched between a rock and a hard place . 
  instructions unclear , cyprus sold to north korea . 
  damn , did n't know those fjords along the norwegian coastline are that fertile . 
  still better than pictures of snow . 
  it will benefit anyone but us europeans . 
  noooo, 
  it 's also very common to live near the border and work in austria . 
  it 's not about right and left . 
  our socialist party was even worse . 
  the problem with that , is that there are no better alternatives to vote for . 
  everyone who gets into politics does so by licking the boots of the higher-ups . 
  plus , political apathy is extremely widespread here . 
  about 80 % of my former school classmates now live/study abroad . 
  and most of those who stayed have moved to budapest anyway , because you just ca n't make a living elsewhere . 
  a lot of eastern european countries are introducing programs that basically reward you for having more children , and there 's a general economic growth , so it 's plausible that the population will grow . 
  ( though brain drain is still a big problem ) . 
  that sounds nice on paper , but the central european government already routinely ignores eastern europe 's positions , and tries to force policies on it that it does n't agree with . 
  centralizing it further would just further increase anti-eu sentiment in the east . 
  maybe they 're getting downvoted by other europeans because they do n't appreciate russian/serbian ultra-nationalist sentiments and being apologetic to aggressive foreign policy towards the rest of europe .
