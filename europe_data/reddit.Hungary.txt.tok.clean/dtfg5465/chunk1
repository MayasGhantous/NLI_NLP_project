thats just a stage name i think, 
  the democrats should n't have f * cked bernie sanders . 
  they made their bed but all of us gon na lay in it :(, 
   it 's very interesting to see that he wants to restrict civilian access to certain guns , while dealing with guns illegally . 
  it 's not strange at all . 
  if there is no legal way to buy a gun , and you still want one you have to buy it illegally . 
  and he is selling them illegally ... 
  / me triggered, 
  budapest , prague , vienna are all good choices . 
  hungary took in aproxx . 
  30 thousand people long term during the yugoslaw wars in the 90s . 
  `` fun '' fact : in 92 austria identified hungary as a safe third country so anybody who arrived to austria through hungary from the yoguslaw wars were denied as a refugee !, 
  no , they were nomal everyday people who had enough of the communist dictatoship, 
  yes you are right , but i think financial reason is the main factor . 
  i 'm talking about eu countries only . 
  it 's not a culture thing , it 's a money thing . 
  in the richer northern and western countries young people move out and in the poorer southern and eastern states they do n't . 
  ( because they ca n't afford it ), 
  he shares the place , so i 'm guessing that 150 eur is just his half and the total is 300 . 
  not sick . 
  just broke as fuck . 
  i think only some of this differnce is cultural and the main reason is financial . 
  for example in hungary a small one bedrom apartment ( around 30m2 ) in the outskirt of a big city ( not budapest ) without furnitures or any machines will cost you 50 % of the minimum wage !, 
  ( bills are not inculed !, 
  it 's just the rent . ), 
  these are the cheapest ones . 
  how is it in your country ? 
  how much does it cost to rent a small one bedroom apartment on the side of the city in relation to the minimum wage ? 
  she did n't win an award !, 
  her husband won an award she just received it instead of him . 
  no it wo n't take down a country . 
  just like loosing your arm wo n't kill you but i do n't wan na loose mine . 
  if they want to do that it 's totally okay . 
  just do n't make us to do the same . 
  honestly , i do n't think that these people are our ( the eu ) responsibility . 
  it would be different if they were our neighbours . 
  ( hungary took in aproxx . 
  30 thousand people long term during the yugoslaw wars in the 90s . 
  `` fun '' fact : in 92 austria identified hungary as a safe third country so anybody who arrived in austria through hungary from the yoguslaw wars were denied as a refugee !!! ), 
  our responsibility is the unemployed masses in southern and eastern europe or stopping orb\u00e1n and other mini duces and oligarchs , or finally fixing the economy because the economic crisis started in 2008 and it 's still not over !, 
  2nd point `` a permanent relocation mechanism for all member states '' http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-15-5596_en.htm  hungary could have resettled those 1294 and refused to cooperate in a open-ended scheme without problems . 
  we refused to cooperate in short term but it was useless because it was pushed through with a majority vote anyway . 
  that could have happened with the open-ended scheme too . 
  according to frontex 1.82 million illegal entry were detected http://frontex.europa.eu/assets/publications/risk_analysis/fran_q4_2015.pdf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_migrant_crisis it means approximately 1 million people . 
  we would have to take in 1.1 percent of those that 's 11 000 people only in 2015 . few hunderd thousand already arrived this year too more than 200 000 up until may http://www.iom.int/news/mediterranean-migrant-arrivals-2016-204311-deaths-2443 so 400000-500000 people will come again this year . 
  just imagine how much more that would be if `` willkommenskultur '' would still be a thing !, 
  that means we would have to take in 15000-16000 people in 2015 and 2016 alone !, 
  the main problem was not that 1294 migrants . 
  the problem was that they wanted to make a system out of it . 
  that 1294 people were out of 120 000 , but that year more than a million arrived to the eu , so based on that system we would had to take in more than 10 000 in that year alone !, 
  in a few years it would have meant tens of thousands of people !, 
  why do western european countries want a turkey in the eu when they already have one :(, 
  yes , actually the `` n\u00e9pszabads\u00e1g '' just turned profitable . 
  it made 134 million huf ( almost half a million euros ) profit in 2015 . source in hungarian : http://index.hu/belfold/2016/10/08/miert_kellett_kinyirni_a_nepszabadsagot/, 
   i 'd like to hear the same from the eu now regarding british ** immigrants ** . 
  there , i fixed it for you , 
  the cars are older and older cars have longer antenna . 
  we have retroactive laws  ( but this referendum did n't have anything to do with the already agreed 160000 migrant quota . ), 
  does n't matter . 
  fidesz is already saying they are going to make a new law ( maybe even change the constitution ) just because there were more no votes than yes votes . 
  it does n't matter to them that the vote is invalid because less than 50 % of the voters voted . 
  nobody in the eu gives a shit about the migrants ( maybe merkel and that 's it . ), 
  this is the inconvenient truth . 
  austria is currently building a wall , so does norway . 
  sweden wants to send a lot of them back to hungary , and so on and on . 
  and how is the relocation of those 160 000 migrants going ? 
  nobody 's doing anything about it . 
  maybe a few hunderd were relocated . 
  nobody 's eager about it, 
  only hungarian ones . 
   i 've seen one redditor claim that the hungarian referendum is supposed to legally have no bearing on the refugees already allotted to hungary ( ~ 1300 people ) . 
  not sure whether that is true though . 
  it is true . 
  it does n't matter what the result is , it ca n't change eu policy . 
  it 's just a bullshit referendum so the fidesz can campaign , get some more supporters and to divert attention from their corruption and their other fuckups in education and healthcare . 
  yes !, 
   le-pen vs melenchon would be a far more interesting contest . 
  that would mean the end of the eu , no mateer who is the winner . 
  yes and le pen is economically far left . 
  so m\u00e9lenchon could steal some votes from her, 
  edit 3 : protest is still ongoing , there are several live streams but i ca n't share it because they are on facebook and redit automatically deletes comments with facebook link in them :(, 
  not russia that 's for sure / s, 
  approx . 
  70-80 thousand protesters short drone clip https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf2zepffhnw edit : riot police is getting ready : http://imgur.com/cz9be5l edit 2 : protest is still ongoing but it got smaller in the meantime . 
  `` russia 's largest search engine , yandex , has confirmed that it passed confidential data to the country 's state security service , fsb . '', 
  read more here : http://www.bbc.com/news/business-13274443, 
  this is how : http://www.bbc.com/news/business-13274443 people ' info ( who donated money to the oppostion ) were given to the fsb, 
  eu probably paid out the money but it was stolen, 
  the yandex is a company similar to the google , but it is giving data to the russian goverment about opposition partys , people etc. 
  so if you want to be in a russian goverment database somewhere just visit nemzetikonzultacio.kormany.hu  ** ( it 's probably just visitor statistic but the optics are so f * ckin bad ) ** edit : bolded parts . 
  i jut thought it is interesting ( trivial sure ) , it is an official goverment website . 
  not every jobbik voters is a fascicst ( maybe a third and you have that much everywhere in the world ) lot of the jobbik voters are dissapointed mszp voters or young voters who did n't like either fidesz or the mszp . 
  small majority of the jobbik voters are pro eu too !!, 
  according the a poll last year if the vote to join the eu would be now 58 % would vote yes to join and 33 % would vote no . 
  hungarians living abroad ( hungarian minority in romania , slovakia serbia etc. ), 
  can vote by mail but hungarians who moved abroad from hungary have to vote at an embassy !, 
  the first group of hungarians are mostly fidesz voters so it was made easy for them to vote . 
  the second group ( who moved abroad to work because they could n't in hungary ) are not so much so it was made harder for them to vote !, 
  they changed the election law so a smaller win could result in two thirds of parliement seats . 
  in hungary you need 2/3 of the parliament to change the constitution so the fidesz can make any law they want .
