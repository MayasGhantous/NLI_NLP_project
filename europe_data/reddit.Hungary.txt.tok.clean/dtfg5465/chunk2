  if it is unconstitutional they just change the constitution ( they had 2/3 before but it looked like they will wo n't have enough votes to keep it so they changed the election law so a smaller win was enough for the 2/3 ), 
  before you all go `` just leave the eu dumb hungarians '' i would like to say that orb\u00e1n 's support not that big . 
  in the last election http://imgur.com/a/r982i 39 % of the voters did n't vote for anybody 34 % voted for opposition partys 27 % voted for fidesz . 
  the only reason the fidesz controls two thirds of the parliament because the fidesz changed the election law before the election . 
  it 's the same with abortion too . 
  only thing is ( according to laws - not sure about the croatian laws though ) that life does n't start at the moment of conception but later . 
   it 's punishment for being anti-constitutional . 
  wow , for a moment i thought orb\u00e1n wrote this comment . 
  wow , these comments  russian trolls woke up early , 
  my point is that eastern europe is not that cheap . 
  for example a mcdonalds cheeseburger cost ~ 1 $ , same as in germany a cappucino is about ~ 1.50 $ just ate a doner kebab today for ~ 3 $ i think if you combine everything if you want to live the same lifestyle in eastern europe as in western europe it 's going to cost you about 70-75 % of the western cost . 
  ( and not 25 % a lot of people seems to think - not you specifically ), 
  they are much more similar than you would think . 
  things in stores cost the same for example . 
  the only things cheaper in eastern europe are services .

  the problem is they controll all of the govermnet branches ( of course they control the parlament that 's ok , they won the election ) cops blocking collecting booth : https://scontent.ftsr1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/16665307_1249100168509217_8726849343386441360_o.jpg?oh=135fb798ff113c86b6e997ff7336d800&amp;oe=5954aa43 https://scontent.ftsr1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/16487735_1249100251842542_6790703564027693397_o.jpg?oh=3769a8fa125924e520e24973f1ee006c&amp;oe=599425b5 https://scontent.ftsr1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/16487856_1249100291842538_8846289684652763336_o.jpg?oh=c9f938f0925078d22013bce61f2d7a69&amp;oe=594f2233, 
  lol :d fidesz bought origo like 2 years ago from deutsche telekom ( index is owned by a fidesz oligarch too called sp\u00e9der but they had a falling out but they were pretty central always . ), 
  fidesz bought up tv stations too , there is only 1 big tv station that is not fidesz controlled ( rtl klub ) they closed down the biggest opposition newspaper ( n\u00e9pszabads\u00e1g ) and after that they bought up newspapers ( bunch of local ones ), 
  the hungarian press is 90 % fidesz owned . 
  ( through their oligarch ) people get fired if they support opposition partys so we can safely say that the press and opposition is supressed ( not russian level , but we are getting there ), 
  it would be a really long list , but few key things are - there is no seperation of powers . 
  the executive , legislature and judiciary branches are all controlled by fidesz . 
  - retrospective laws - fidesz stopped a referendum using muscle ( bouncer like men phisically stopped others from initiate a referendum ) and it was later deemed legal - when people collected signatures for another referendum in some places cops blocked the way to the `` collecting booth '', 
  too bad i 'm a right voter and i still think that hungary is not democratic now . 
  ( it 's as democratic as turkey ), 
  when the fidesz destroyed the hungarian democracy they did n't care at all and in some cases even actively helped him !, 
  did n't give a shit about the hungarian people but when it comes to a bunch of people from africa then they raise their voices and act tough . 
  it feels great to be 3rd rate citizen ... / s, 
  will they tell this austria too ? 
  they want out too of the migrant quota now . 
  yes , in the us the states deal with these kind of education stuff not the federal goverment, 
  your post is bullshit . 
  the new law was designed specifically against the ceu . 
  for example this new law states that if the headquarter of the university is in a federative country ( wow , the us is exactly fits this category what are the chances / s ) then it 's not enough if only the state enter into a contract with the hungarian goverment but a federal goverment has to too . 
  ** tldr : if the ceu wants to stay open then donald trump has to sign a contract with the hungarian goverment **, 
  scientology is banned in germany so regulating religion is a thing in germany . 
  they just do n't want to do it . 
  yes , here it is : http://portal.nebih.gov.hu/documents/10182/323140/03.29_terme%cc%81k-o%cc%88sszehasonli%cc%81ta%cc%81s_kiadv%c3%a1ny.pdf/2cd70738-db21-4fad-8af0-2c53290935a9 funny thing is it is ** not ** confirms the double standars  out of 91 products there were differences 70 times ** but ** - 20 out of the 91 products were n't even the same !, 
  ( so of course they are different ) - 63 times the differences were only subjective ( sensory ) - out of those 63 times often the hungarian product were better :d they found a difference in the haribo gummy bears which is n't a difference . 
  according to the study the foreign haribo contains maracuja fruit meanwhile the hungarian haribo contains `` passi\u00f3 '' fruit and this is the difference . 
  ** but ** the maracuja fruit 's hungarian name is `` passi\u00f3 '' fruit so there is n't any difference at all :d :d, 
  are they pressuring austria too ? 
  austria wants out of quotas now too !, 
   they are targets for crime because they often carry cash and many do n't have residence permits maybe they should use banks and get their paperwork in order ? 
  illegal immigrants with a lot of cash on them , that does n't sound shady at all / s, 
  hungary : least illegal spending hahaha ( you forgot the / s on the map ) :d, 
  how should people know they are buying worse product than in western europe ? 
  the name , the logo are the same and you ca n't buy the western europan ones to compare the ingredients yourself . 
  the problem is a lot of people do n't even know they are fed inferior product !, 
  it 's simple , if the ingredients are different the companies should call the product different too . 
  so for example if the nutella in the west contains 15 % cocoa and they want to sell a 13 % version in eastern europe they should n't be allowed to call it nutella . 
  ( maybe call it polish nutella but not just nutella ) edit : and if the eastern version would contain more cocoa it would still apply of course . 
  here in hungary the eu actually helped corruption and made sure that the russians can build our new nuclear power plant . 
  ( 10 billion eur business , it will make us even more dependent on russia ) http://www.politico.eu/article/eu-approves-hungary-nuclear-deal-amid-oettinger-controversy/ https://euobserver.com/political/136066 juncker and schulz even worked together to save the russian 's lobbyist . 
  make austria-hungary great again !!, 
  read the top comment, 
  go full ceausescu on them guys . 
  that 's the only thing corrupt eastern european politicans understand . 
  finally !, 
  i hope we ( the eu ) implement the australian model . 
  of course the inequality is low in eastern europe . 
  everybody is broke as f * ck, 
  not just soros fundes ngo-s . every ngo-s . 
  you forgot the '' / s '' :d, 
  literally 0 people died in eastern europe because of muslim , isis terrorism western europe is lot more dangerous in this regard . 
  well it depends . 
  if you divide europe to 2 parts , western and eastern europe then it 's eastern europen country . 
  if you divide europe to 3 parts ( western , central , eastern ) it 's central european . 
  from here ( hungary ) czechia sometimes looks western european too , 
  what 's wrong with the goverment ? 
  sure it 's not a democratic one , but neither is china for example and nobody wants to give asylum for 1 billion chinese . 
  there is a safe area in syria too so taking people directly is not necessary . 
  yes . 
  they just simply want to make it a constitutional law too not just a regular one . 
   just dump them on the coast of a random north african nation or what ? 
  no , drop him off on the coast of the last nation on his route before the eu . 
  ( coastguards tracking these boats ) ( so if he got on boat in libya drop him off there . ), 
  i ca n't wait for him to be suprised when the `` far-right '' gets stronger again . 
  eu courts ( i do n't know which one exactly ) made pushbacks illegal . 
  if pushback were legal again that would basically solve the problem . 
  not the eu , just a few countries . 
  we do n't have those barriers around christmas markets . 
  ( and i 'm guessing poland romania etc. 
  do n't have them either ), 
  this article is fake news . 
  and even he came to europe searching for a better life , why should europe allow it ? 
  the eu should make life better for eu citizens not the whole world . 
  or the police found the id soon , but did n't tell the public because they did n't want the terrorist to know they are onto him . 
  thank you for the translation !, 
  yes !!, 
  make austro-hungarian empire great again !, 
  for example their pm candidate was convicted, 
  as a hungarian i agree . 
  things cost the same here , some things maybe even more expensive than in western europe . 
  services can be cheaper ( getting a haircut for example ) . 
  haha , psd is a populist party , 
  here is a few concrete things - make pushback legal again in the mediterranean - hunt down people smugglers - deport back everybody if their country or part of their country is safe ( this country does n't have to be democratic or wealthy . ), 
  - stop the africa-europe ferry service ( european ships picking up people only a few kilometres of the coast of africa and they are brought here , it 's outrageous ! ),
