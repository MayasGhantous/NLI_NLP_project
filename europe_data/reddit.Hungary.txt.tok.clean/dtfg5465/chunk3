  - ban total face covering clothing everywhere - dissolve child marriages - child protective services should take away children if they are being religiously indoctrinated or not allowed to socialize with the other genders etc - stop the goverment founding of mosques ( wether it is local goverment or saud-arabia for example ), 
  yes thats obvious . 
  what is not obvious that wilders was talking about them when he said he wants less moroccans in the country . 
  when did he say that he means dutch citizens ? 
  i read that he was talking about moroccans . 
  he did not say dutch citizens with moroccan descent . 
  no , why would i ? 
  i think you can say good bye to the dna ( it 's one of the best anti-corruption agency in europe ), 
  if they are lucky they can even get a few hundred dollars as tax every year !, 
  so the people who campaigned and voted against the eu-ukraine association agreement in the netherlands will be punished too ? 
  they want less ukrainians and they were vocal about that . 
   well for example because your country has so vigorously blocked a new eu wide system . 
  you mean the `` let everyone in no matter where are they from and we distribute them later '' system ? 
  i want strong outer border and us like immigration and deportation system ( but maybe even stronger ), 
  for f * cks sake , why do we have to mess greece this way ? 
  just deport them back to africa ( and make pushback legal again ) and be done with it . 
  there is a trick in the hungarian tax though !, 
  companys have to pay additional 27 % and 1.5 % tax after the salaries so these taxes do n't show up on the employe 's side . 
  for example if you take home 500 euros ( net wage ) then your gross wage is 750 euros but you cost the company almost a 1000 euros total . 
  so in reality the hungarian tax is almost 50 %, 
  he wants strong european military . 
  thats anti-russian . 
  hungary - pornstars i 'm not even suprised, 
  hitler is ( and was ) a `` hero for many '' so ... 
  i hate the guy , and i hate the germans for backing him too . 
  he could n't get away with a lot of shit otherwise . 
  germany is really cosy towards russia too !, 
  they tried to build nord stream 2 despite the sanctions , they made sure that the russians can build a nuclear power plant in hungary and the eu wo n't be able to stop it . 
  as a hungarian i 'm really happy about this !, 
  you never know when is orban going full retard and welcomes putin 's sweet embrace ... 
  it 's random . 
  there are 3 options . 
  hard brexit soft brexit hard brexit but scotland leaves uk and joins eu, 
   they will never be able to outdo le pen at her own game that 's not necessarily true . 
  in hungary almost the whole fidesz immigration policy was the jobbik 's idea 2-3 years ago . 
  ( for example the fence and so on ) now everybody thinks the fidesz came up with it , but they just simply stole it from the jobbik, 
  we are not related to the finns by blood only by language . 
  and that is a just a theory too ( an official one though ) but there are other theories, 
  i think it 's unnecessary . 
  we should just introduce 32 hours work weeks and close the tax loophole for corporations and for private persons . 
  hungary 's picture is wrong . 
  this is the real deal :d http://i.imgur.com/ro8aqw2.jpg, 
  oh come on . 
  there are 2 powerful fraction in libya . 
  we ( the eu ) should support the one which will let us send back migrants . 
  the other one would be defeated in like weaks . 
  qatar just bought neymar for ~ quarter billion euros , i 'm sure they would love to help their co-religionists . 
  the whole nord stream business started way before the migrant crisis, 
  fun fact : not the bkk but the t-systems ( deutsche telekom ) reported the kid to the police . 
  pis can act against the citizens without the people realizing it . 
  picking the up is a requirement but dropping them of in the eu is not !, 
  and if you are not there you ca n't pick up anybody . 
  one of the greatest hungarian king . 
  they should be sued for false advertising . 
  i hope consumer protection agencies are watching . 
  enforcing outer eu borders would be enough . 
   they also get refugees , 10000 applications in 2016 . and they let in like 5 :d edit : they let in 28 last year :d [ reuters ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-asylum-iduskbn15o0uv ) i could live with that number, 
  yes, 
  orb\u00e1n is probably a billionaire . 
  he means the seven magyar tribes, 
  the hungarian $ 2.64 is gross wage , the net hourly wage is about 1.78 usd, 
  if anything i think the eu needs a first amendment to protect free speech !, 
  in the last election only 27 % voted for orb\u00e1n . 
  basically he is as popular in hungary as marine le pen in france . 
  but here the opposition is shitty and the vote is only 1 round ( it was 2 round but orb\u00e1n changed it - i wonder why ? 
  / s - and there was some gerrymandering too ), 
  i do n't get it . 
  would you care to elaborate ? 
  nope , it 's the astra then corsa, 
  hungary 's brand is wrong , skoda is n't even in the top 5 . 
  2015 overall data : 1 . 
  ford 5 . 
  renault newly bought cars : 1 . 
  ford, 
  lithium-ion batteries blow up when oxygen gets into them . 
  ** c ** onservative and ** u ** nionist ** n ** egotiating ** t ** eam :d, 
  juncker should slam everyone then because only like 20 thousand refugees were relocated out of the 160 thousand in 2 years , 
  even austrians came with cars so they could take the poor refugees away from racist , nasty hungary . 
  jobbik is less far right than the fidesz now . 
  43 % of the people who went to vote . 
  but only 27 % of voters voted for fidesz in the last election . 
  these are basically le pen numbers . 
  but we have only 1 round ( the fidesz changed it to 1 round of course ) shitty opposition , and less people goes to vote . 
  hungary : ingatlan.com and jofogas.hu ( this one is not a real estate only but a general advertisement site but it 's really huge . ), 
  most of these crimes are committed by gypsies . 
  and gypsies are migrants so he is proving our point for us :d, 
   1 ) europeans are not defined by blood yes they are ( most of the time ) . 
  it 's called juis sanguinis : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jus_sanguinis, 
  combined force ??!!, 
  make austria-hungary great again !, 
  there was no terror attack in hungary !, 
  the event this map is referring ( bomb found on a bus ) was because rivaling bus companies . 
  and the bus was bulgarian !, 
  oh and the `` bomb '' was made out of window cleaning fluid and a watch . 
   providing each family with a furnished apartment immediately upon arrival , language courses , schools , translation services and a dedicated support person who will help guide the newcomers through the settling-in process . 
  i 'm hungarian . 
  can i go too ? 
  estonia sounds awesome !, 
  south americans maybe ? 
  wow , sounds slavic !,
