introducing mandatory refugee quotas is not a solution . 
  you have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  you 've seen a couple of vides on the internet and read some strongly worded comments on reddit and have made an assumption based on those . 
  how does the hungarian government exactly treat everyone ? 
  the vast majority of them are not fleeing from war . 
  and since the eu has failed to adress the problem , countries must take actions themselves . 
  whether you like our solution or not , we do n't have a crisis anymore . 
  also , schengen does not automatically mean that anybody can enter into hungarian territory . 
  austria and germany have also introduced border checkes again . 
  who is also the only competent leader in this crisis . 
  we did that and we 're literally worse than hitler . 
  no , you compared the fence on our border to the ukrainian situation . 
  again , do you honestly believe that the two are comperable ? 
  do you honestly believe that the two are comperable ? 
  no , they do n't get ` fuckton of young guys ' . 
  every faction face serious manpower problems . 
  especially [ assad ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/07/syria-assad-speech-150726091936884.html ) . 
  people and the media can say whatever they want but orban handled this issue very well . 
  not just the fence , the entire migrant crisis . 
  croatia has failed in a day and is now sending the refugees to hungary because ca n't handle them . 
  we 've been doing it for months and contrary to what you might have read or heard we are n't that bad at it . 
  they are allowed to cross the border if they apply for asylum in hungary . 
  they do n't want to do that . 
  yes , it does matter . 
  well , not for you maybe but it 's getting incredibly ridiculous how much the western media try to make us the bad guys . 
  we ca n't , that 's true . 
  but then we should n't pretend that we care . 
  because we do n't . 
  i guess you missed the part where i said :  the very same people, 
   there 's a difference between 75 people dying in a truck somewhere in syria there is n't . 
  had the very same people died in syria , you would n't have bat an eye . 
  but they died in europe and suddenly it 's inhuman . 
  this is the very definition of hypocricy . 
  i know this is n't the point of the video and i should n't say this in a thread like this but those girls are * beautiful * . 
  kosovars do need visa though . 
  i grew up in south-west hungary and smuggling people has been a big business since the early '90s . 
  back then it was mainly serbians and hungarians who were doing it . 
  i knew 4 guys who went to prison because of this . 
  not that many , i can tell you that . 
  the number of refugees in the country is growing every day . 
  i 'm going to keep posting [ this article ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34038779 ) until you people will finally believe that we 're full . 
  you did literally nothing in ww2 . 
  shipping 8000 people to norway is not an achievement . 
  while in poland over 6.500 people earned the title righteous among the nations . 
   this would be a diplomatic incident of first magnitude . 
  it would n't . 
  there are currently three countries in europe , that i know of , that do this . 
  germany , ireland and hungary . 
  you 've got yourself a deal . 
  it 's not a domestic issue . 
  it 's a direct consequence of you meddling in the middle east where our soldiers died too . 
  on a second thought , you 're right . 
  seeing how much you fucked up every country where you 've gone to help , it 'll be better if you just sit this one out . 
  yeah . 
  did we get any benefit from our dead soldiers during * your * middle eastern campaign ? 
  it 's a fuckin ' alliance not your toy , mate . 
  if one of the members needs help you go and help . 
  get off the high horse !, 
  it 's not about the criminals . 
  we 're full . 
  literally . 
  there 's no more room for refugees in this country . 
  i posted [ this article ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34038779 ) last night . 
  watch the video . 
  the bbc reporter barely finds the words . 
  and this is only one train station . 
  he 's a * bad * ass . 
  first of all i replied to this comment :  the 10 's will be remembered as the decade of currency wars it wo n't be . 
  there are things that are way more relevant to people 's everyday lives than the chinese toying around with currencies . 
  what 's happening in greece is very sad but neither the first ( or 10th , 20th ) in the history nor the last one . 
   when it devastate the functioning of whole countries yeeeah ... we 're nowhere near that at the moment . 
  relevant username ? 
  well , so far we 've had an arab spring , a crimean war , thousands of dying immigrants and hundreds of thousands of refugees , isis and the complete mess in the middle east . 
  i 'm not sure some currency problems will make the history books . 
  the hell is going on in this thread ? 
  i have n't met any nationalists from romania but i have to put up with the `` hungarian is an ancient culture '' bullshit on a daily bases . 
  well , if it 's hunnic then it 's not hungarian . 
  i mean , we have almost the exact same myth : k\u0151m\u0171ves kelemen ( stonemason kelemen , how original ) but they were building a castle instead of a monastery . 
  and they shot a bear in germany the very first moment it crossed the border . 
  but you must take care of your predators . 
   so , no , not yet . 
  i know it 's a stereotype but guly\u00e1s really is my favourite food . 
  so , the system being succesful is not a story ? 
  only the drowning refugees and such ? 
  yeah , that 's a different case . 
  but it works with most of the email adresses . 
  i think 9 out of 10 emails that i come across at my job is gmail , yahoo , freemail or citromail . 
  recently i also often hear people say the first part of the email adress then just say the email provider , omitting `` kukac '' altogether . 
  now putin can go on and tell the people of russia that they 're imposing more sanctions on europe than vice versa and yet the economy is still going strong . 
  or recently [ donald trump ] ( https://www.google.hu/search?q=donald+trump+mexico&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=909&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cayq_auoawovchmi-7bq0--jxwivqztych1m6wuj#tbm=isch&amp;q=donald+trump+pinata ) . 
  it 's from 476 to 800 . 
  but it was n't dark in anyway . 
  the way people use it is a complete bullshit . 
  * i love the smell of napalm in the morning . 
  i mean , is n't it true ? 
  [ these people ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvn4prlrpsa ) are supposedly speaking english in this video . 
  not the only one but they played a big role in it . 
  [ starting with their camps . 
  ] ( http://nypost.com/2015/05/30/how-the-us-created-the-camp-where-isis-was-born/ ), 
  and in hungary too .
