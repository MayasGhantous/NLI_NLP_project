  my advice : do n't get angry over it , it 's not worth it . 
  just do your thing , develop the economy and infrastructure and ignore them when they are being hypocritical . 
  i , for one , never understood that whole `` romania is gypsy '' thing . 
  we do n't like each other sure , but every magyar knows the difference between romanian and roma . 
  that not-integrating is literally everywhere , except in the mainstream media . 
  their libtard shilling and preaching is really getting on my nerves lately . 
  possessing an austrian passport and citizenship does not make you austrian . 
  well played you cheeky c * nt, 
  slovakia is beautiful country . 
  the high tatras in the slovak-polish border are a sight to behold . 
  kosice has too much commie-blocks though . 
   austria-hungry triggered, 
  i know both of them very well :d, 
  poor girl , not only she was a victim of an abhorrent crime , her trust in what supposed be her guardians was permanently shattered . 
  this makes me so f **** ng angry ... 
  gate of freedom and tolerance ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ tm, 
  [ why stop at two ? 
  ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/polandball/images/3/39/austria-hungary-croatiaball.png/revision/latest?cb=20150624095728 ), 
  [ fine by me :d ] ( http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/polandball/images/a/a5/austria-hungr%c3%adaball.png/revision/latest?cb=20150501013918 ), 
   oh yeah , great . 
  now austrian is at fault . 
  welcome to the club pal, 
  also , his facial muscles are in a permanent state of convulsion because of all that smiling . 
  yes , we also have a lot of german and t\u00fcrkish loanwords . 
  now that you mention it , im currently in adidas sweatpants eating sunflower seeds ( szotyi ) . 
  say what you will about the russians , they mastered the art of trolling . 
  you was boiled in it , molded by it ... 
  thanks , that 's really interesting !, 
  according to my hungarian teacher , kir\u00e1ly is a slavic loan word from kr\u00e1l . 
  til this is true :d, 
  well said . 
  as much as pains me to say , you are right . 
  i do n't want migrants , but seeing this behaviour and attitude towards greece , it 's just a huge disgrace . 
  orban does n't want a solution , he wants to make politics . 
  and we do n't have the monies or the resources to do anything meaningful . 
  try to explain this to the big corporations who want to protect their interest . 
  though as they explained above me , you must have a healthy industrial sector , but you need a balanced and diversified economy as well . 
  [ drooling intensifies ], 
   no one believes in the norse gods anymore dude what are you talking about , there is a film about thor and loki . 
  are you telling me they are not real ? 
  [ sorry dude , i forgot our mongol heritage ] ( https://dailymagyar.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/daily_magyar_08_10.png ), 
  yeah , especially mashed potatoes with butter and sour cream . 
  now i made myself hungry :(, 
  where do i sign up ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ seriously ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ though, 
  not just slovenia , but croatia , romania and bulgaria should join imho . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ glorious ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ central ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ european ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ reich ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ when, 
  both , imho . 
  shill harder son . 
  still reinventing hot water i see . 
  however , if they are forced to say this things out loud , there is hope for europe yet . 
  right after my succesfull physiology exam , i had a nightmare that i failed , and woke up crying and sweating . 
  should i post the video ? 
  yes . 
  if we countries was n't capable of integrating them , what hope do we have with recent arrivals ? 
  you are right . 
  on one hand , i do n't want illegal migrants at all , but on the other , greece does n't deserve to be treated like this , just because it is on the wrong place at the wrong time . 
  i unironically say this , the v4 should be focus on helping your country manage it 's borders both on the land and sea . 
  is that so ? 
  ^ then ^ ^ gib ^ ^ ^ clay ^ ^ ^ ^ / s jokes aside , i agree with your sentiment , but ppl will always see this as meddling in their countries affairs , and given the u.s. history , well ... 
  reminds me of my chemistry professor : stupid cunt , but one of the best teachers . 
  b-but mooooom ... 
  * cries silently in the corner *, 
  i still have 4 months until state exam , but this picture is giving me nightmares . 
  thank you for your insight . 
  if you do n't mind me asking , what is the current political landscape in slovakia ? 
  will fico win the next elections ( it will take place in autumn if i am not mistaken ) ? 
  and yes , i am from hungary , i enabled the flag now :d, 
  yeah , i was wondering about that myself . 
  i can understand why our current regime is disliked in ukraine ( the whole putin comes to budapest in the middle of a war fiasco ) , but hating slovakia ? 
  fico was always wary of russian agression , and supportive of ukraine . 
  weed, 
  til her nickname is steel magnolia . 
  that 's pretty badass . 
  holy kek !, 
  when i was on shrooms , i was just lying in my ( dry ) bathtub and began composing music to dropping water , but hey ... 
   parked his van on the dam and slaughtered and ate his own dog after taking shrooms i have a million questions right now ... 
  everybody should be encouraged to learn hungarian , the true master language . 
  yes , i am a bit sadistic ... 
  dear slovakia , your tatratea is very tasty and stronk ( !!, 
  still , better late than never . 
  it would be the stupidest thing ever . 
  iran is bleeding on domestic front , an outward attack would galvanize the supreme leader 's power . 
  just like the west . 
  they also benefit immensely from the common market and outsourcing factories to the east . 
  germany in particular enjoys a large brain-drain from ce . 
  so get off your high horse , everyone in this union is part of it because it 's beneficial overall . 
  let 's be honest , you 'd gladly sacrifice poland , belarus , ukraine and the baltics if russia was attacking . 
  treaties are one thing , acting upon them is another . 
  wwii showed us how much germans value treaties with other countries . 
  that 's still 45 percent male . 
  oh and i would be very curious about these `` children 's '' age . 
  i do n't agree with you , but i respect your opinion . 
  so jelly , these mountains are spectacular . 
  i see you point , thank you . 
  corgis and cute guys distracted you ? 
  we are poor and corrupt , if it makes you feel better . 
  when push comes to shove , austria will stay with the west . 
  estonia was a member of the eastern block , we are more similar than we are differrent . 
  you are right , we need them .
