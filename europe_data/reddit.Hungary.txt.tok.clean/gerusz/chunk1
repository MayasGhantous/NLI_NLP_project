uh , please stop with those comparisons , now orb\u00e1n will surely claim the entire castle of buda ( as in : the whole district i ) as his own private residence ( after he builds a soccer stadium on v\u00e9rmez\u0151 , of course ) . 
  keywords : ** in this form ** . 
  i think he will just tax the isps on a per-customer basis ( having them pay the cap regardless of the usage ) instead of the consumption basis . 
  i always wondered how the highways can be free in the west . 
  ( this is a bit less than the hungarian toll , which has to be paid by hungarians too . ), 
  i 'd be ok with 3-4 megapascals ... 
  i 'm pretty sure there is a step 2 : `` oh , yeah . 
  so we realized that this would also tax people using the egovernment-services . 
  so from now on those services are tax-free . '', 
  they will word the `` government-provided services are tax-free '' ambiguously so only they could calculate the tax . 
  and boom , now nav ( the tax authority ) gets everyone 's complete internet usage data . 
  if there is a cap on a tax , it will be raised . 
  no exceptions . 
  i wonder what would happen if latin was included . 
  well , he only had to learn two pages or so ... 
  for the ncore !, 
  well , many people are telling the government to love themselves , and their mothers . 
  but less politely . 
  if there is a ceiling on a tax , it will be raised eventually . 
  so far ? 
  the best `` argument '' is that people are using the internet to make phone calls , thus avoiding the tax on the ordinary phone calls . 
  and then the usual divide and conquer , `` we wanted to use the money from this to raise the wages of the police and other public employees , so the demonstrators are against raising your wages !, 
  in our case it 's conservative ideology . 
  half-hanged , drawn and quartered for the males , burnt at the stake for the females ? 
  [ huh . 
  ] ( http://www.oecd.org/pisa/keyfindings/pisa-2012-results-snapshot-volume-i-eng.pdf ) ok , now my questions is : how ? 
  dear finland , our education system is even more fucked up . 
  please , fix ours first . 
  signed , your distant relative . 
   english is an indo-european language , connecting it in some way to the national languages of every member state . 
  khm ... 
  dutch people : the funniest shitlords in europe . 
   only residents of the town can buy weed there . 
  legally , that is . 
  the second the law was enforced ( = all coffee shops except 1 were shut down because they did n't give a shit ) the streets were swarmed by drug dealers . 
  so ... just because i exist , 6 other hungarians do n't speak any foreign language . 
  ... actually , that is about right . 
  sad . 
  and estonian , yeah . 
  but we only share a little bit of vocabulary with them . 
  the grammar and logic might be similar but the languages were separated approximately 3000 years ago and had widely different influences ( hungarian has both ancient and modern turkish influences , which are completely absent from finnish and estonian , for example ) . 
  no , they are not . 
  ecr 's founding principles : 1 . 
  free enterprise , free and fair trade and competition , minimal regulation , lower taxation , and small government as the ultimate catalysts for individual freedom and personal and national prosperity . 
  - this is the polar opposite of the principles of fidesz . 
  freedom of the individual , more personal responsibility and greater democratic accountability . 
  - also the polar opposite , see the nationalization of the private retirement funds for example . 
  sustainable , clean energy supply with an emphasis on energy security . 
  - on this they might agree 4 . 
  the importance of the family as the bedrock of society . 
  - on this too 5 . 
  the sovereign integrity of the nation state , opposition to eu federalism and a renewed respect for true subsidiarity . 
  - on this too , if only because they do n't want to be accountable to anyone 6 . 
  the overriding value of the transatlantic security relationship in a revitalised nato , and support for young democracies across europe . 
  - bwahahahaha , no . 
  see their responses to the crisis in ukraine , they are too busy sucking putin 's dick 7 . 
  effectively controlled immigration and an end to abuse of asylum procedures - their immigration process to hungarians from neighboring countries is probably the least restrictive , and we do n't have an immigration problem otherwise . 
  efficient and modern public services and sensitivity to the needs of both rural and urban communities . 
  - bwahahaha , efficiency and they , that 's hilarious . 
  an end to waste and excessive bureaucracy and a commitment to greater transparency and probity in the eu institutions and use of eu funds . 
  - transparency is a-ok for them ... as long as it 's not their pockets being checked . 
  respect and equitable treatment for all eu countries , new and old , large and small . 
  - this is one of the few points on which they unambiguously agree so they agree on 3-6 of the 10 founding principles . 
  i do n't think they would be a good fit . 
  [ so was l\u00e1szl\u00f3 kov\u00e1cs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/l%c3%a1szl%c3%b3_kov%c3%a1cs_ ( politician \\ ) #eu _ career ) . 
   in 2004 , kov\u00e1cs was nominated to serve as the hungarian member of the european commission , which was to take office on 1 november 2004 . ^ [ 3 ] ( http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20091006-kovacs-laszlo-es-az-economist-altal-kozolt-kritika.html ) his apparent unsuitability for his proposed role as energy commissioner was one of the reasons why the european parliament refused to endorse the proposed new commission . 
  however , the hungarian government did not nominate a new commissioner in his place , therefore in the revised setup of the commission , serving from 22 november 2004 , he was finally appointed as commissioner responsible for taxation and customs union . ^ [ 4 ] ( http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14505501 ), 
  sz\u00e1jer j\u00f3zsef '' * `` in the history of the european union there is no precedent for a candidate getting into the commissioner position through a resit . 
  the responsibility for damaging hungary 's reputation falls onto l\u00e1szl\u00f3 kov\u00e1cs and the one who confirmed his candidacy , ferenc gyurcs\u00e1ny [ then-pm ] . 
  the hungarian delegation to the epp hopes that the hungarian socialist party wo n't try to fill the positions offered by the eu with fallen party politicians and this will close the sad chapter that started with the common list [ mszp and szdsz who were very buddy-buddy back then had a common list on the ep elections ] which is ridiculous on a european level too [ fun fact : fidesz and kdnp were running on the same list since the 2010 elections , including the ep election in 2014 ] and ended with forcing l\u00e1szl\u00f3 kov\u00e1cs onto europe . 
  '' * * budapest , 16 november 2004 * * [ j\u00f3zsef sz\u00e1jer ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%b3zsef_sz%c3%a1jer ) * this was said by fidesz the last time the european union rejected a hungarian candidate , l\u00e1szl\u00f3 kov\u00e1cs as a commissioner . 
  achievement unlocked : drink twice as much coffee as a finn . 
  yeah , copyright beats non-discrimination every time . 
   this is also the country that props up states that are n't doing well instead of all of eu pointing and laughing at southern eu and watch things get worse and worse . 
  because the eu is only a money black hole , its only task is to make money disappear . 
  and it does n't try to prop up the failing countries . 
  yeah . 
   there are states that get literally double the money they pay in back from the federal government . 
  and there are no countries that get back more than what they pay into the eu budget . 
  -- says the guy from a federation where , for example , constituent states do n't get money from the federal highway budget if their drinking age is under 21 . 
   come one hungary , what are you guys doing over there ? 
  moving east is it ? 
   well , who am i to complain , we just bought a russian nuclear power plant . 
  we bought one too , except it was even more expensive ( our politicians steal more ) . 
  [ this is the latest report i could find ] ( http://unsdsn.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/worldhappinessreport2013_online.pdf ) , hungary is # 110 while greece is # 70 . 
  maybe greece is the most unhappy country with $ , but not within the eu . 
  come to hungary , the former happiest barrack of the eastern block ... ... and the current unhappiest country of the eu . 
  i think you 're confusing the baltic states and the balkan http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_states, 
   completely different language estonian is actually related to hungarian . 
  though i do n't think / u/riderer implied that hungary was a baltic state , simply that a politician turning out to be a former kgb agent is something of an everyday occurrence there . 
  the current rhetorically right-wing governing party ( fidesz ) is full of former state party members . 
  not surprising at all for us . 
  ca n't tell if sarcastic , colorblind or just american .

  well , at least it 's not eszmeralda or dzsennifer ...
