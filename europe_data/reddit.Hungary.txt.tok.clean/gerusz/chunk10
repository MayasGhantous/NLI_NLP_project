  strange , i would have expected more than 1 % of the people to be religious in limburg ... 
  money , jobs , hope and a whole set of politicians who do n't think they are feudal lords or communist inner party members . 
  even if they were one or the other once . 
  [ yup , everything is better ] ( http://www.noob.us/humor/family-guy-everything-is-better-with-a-bag-of-weed/ ), 
  hungary : [ guly\u00e1sleves ] ( http://www.femina.hu/recept/igy_keszul_a_tokeletes_gulyasleves/gulyas.jpg ) ( the original ) , probably [ made in a cauldron over open fire ] ( http://blogol.hu/pikz/receptjeim/dscf5834..jpg ) . 
  and a [ dobos-cake ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-w2hvdvqmxwa/tvrhkksh7mi/aaaaaaaaafe/d_2esrtv_cy/s320/dobos+torta+070.jpg ) . 
  there are 10 million more women than men in russia . 
  this , combined with the high inequality , means that the competition for the attention of rich and/or powerful men is cutthroat . 
  though / u/cabinessenceking might be scottish , in which case his dad is drunk off whisky and mean . 
  it looked like the compiled binary in hexadecimal representation . 
  but before that carlyle was writing the code in assembly . 
  who the hell does that for the os of a gigantic space station ? 
  ( unless he tried hiding the code in an actual patch , like a virus . ), 
  btw . 
  agda does n't look that hard . 
  and it 's not supposed to be used to write an os ... 
  in the * binary * ? 
   however , do n't you think there 's a reason why these books are not getting translated to other languages ? 
  * cultural context - many hungarian stories are set in hungary , an alternate hungary or in a fantasy world riddled with creatures from hungarian mythology . 
  for example , you would be baffled by an urban sci-fi/fantasy story about beggar cyborgs made by the chinese unless you 've seen the same beggar literally everywhere in the city . 
  ( yes , that 's an actual chapter in the `` invisible city '' by s\u00e1ndor sz\u00e9lesi . ), 
  * the language itself . 
  it can get really hard to translate . 
  * and simply speaking , there 's an overabundance of english-speaking writers . 
  why would someone translate a hungarian novel with weird-ass names , places the prospective readers have never been and mythology they are unfamiliar with when for every such novel there are 50 novels that have familiar names , places the readers have been to and more standard mythology ( or even take place in an established universe ) ? 
  readers do n't like the unfamiliar . 
  thanks a lot , elop !, 
  they should have went ` droid after the symbian . 
  nokia build quality + android ... one can dream . 
  nobels in what ? 
  yes , the government had to take out loans from the market for a higher interest . 
  no , the economy is only recovering in a parallel universe in which our politicians apparently live . 
  better europe ? 
  fuck if i know . 
  better hungary ? 
  if there was at least a single leading politician who was n't part of the last system ( or did n't try to copy those who were ) , then we might fare much better . 
  how does a 12 y.o. 
  gypsy girl retain her virginity ? 
  she is stronger than her little brothers , faster than her elder brothers and her father is in jail . 
  our gypsy jokes are ranging from `` very offensive '' to `` extremely offensive '' . 
  this must be a bit off . 
  we do have plenty of jokes about the scotsmen , it 's about how extremely frugal you guys are ( `` how do you recognize a scottish house ? 
  the toilet paper is hung out to dry . '' ) . 
  the truly offensive jokes are about jews ( but not israelis , so they ca n't put a flag to that ) , gypsies ( they do n't have a country , but there is a romani flag , they could use that ) and of course romanians . 
  more like being extremely frugal . 
  now the jewish jokes , they are sure as hell about their greed . 
  thanks , obama !, 
  2 homicides per 100k , 60 imprisoned per 100k , so probably ~ 1/30 of the prisoners are in for homicide ? 
  you call it that as well ? 
  `` cucumber season '' in hungarian . 
  but windy as fuck , especially because it 's flat . 
  hungary was pretty close to being a two-party system for ~ 12 years ( between 1998 and 2010 ) . 
  it is also when the population became extremely polarized between fidesz and mszp . 
  with hungarian politics a lasting and stable two-party system would lead to a civil cold war . 
  this wo n't happen in 2014 though , fidesz will win , maybe get another 2/3 ... and the opposition party that will miraculously arise between 2014-2018 will be funded by the same guys that are behind fidesz . 
  it will suck . 
  the real strike was making the election of the local representatives `` one round , winner takes it all '' instead of the previous `` first round : 50 % +1 wins , if no one reached it , second round winner takes it all '' . 
  in the previous system the parties could play some diplomacy between the rounds , candidates could resign , etc. . . so even a fractured opposition could win . 
  the current system essentially awards all of the individual districts to the largest voting block . 
  even if said voting block only has 30-35 % or so . 
  eventually it will stabilize in a 2-party system . 
  ask the americans how well that is working out for them . 
  well , and that due to the new election system , as long as fidesz does n't fall apart it ca n't be changed democratically . 
  and it kind of makes the country ungovernable unless the government has a 2/3 majority . 
  the constitution and the changes are far from being neo-nazi . 
  i hate the new constitution with all my heart , it weakens the checks and balances and cements people and policies , it 's incredibly discriminative towards lgbt people and non-married families , contains a bunch of absolute nonsense , etc. . . but still not neo-nazi . 
  london was disappointing , but anyone who has followed water polo in the last 2 decades would have considered hungary a contender for the gold . 
  ac : we * are * using it , but for many people it 's kind of expensive . 
  and while temperatures above 35 are expected in the country , it 's usually only that hot for a day or two , not for weeks straight . 
  ** netherlands : ** * holy shitballs , it 's hot . 
  ** hungary : ** * oh fuck , it gets worse . 
  * oh yeah , and we are world champions in water polo again . 
  looks like london was only a minor setback for the boys . 
  facebook unusable due to everyone and their dog congratulating them . 
  * some other bullshit , prime minister 's daughter 's marriage treated as a royal marriage ( seriously by the fanatics and sarcastically by everyone else ) , etc. . . - it 's too fucking hot to remember all of the political bullshit that happened , really . 
  i guess just the usual though , new taxes and stuff . 
  as i said , gdp is far from perfect . 
  but there 's a reason why countries are ranked by that . 
  it 's one thing to manipulate statistics , redefine the meaning of some statistical terms that most people have only used in high school , etc. . . and another thing to manipulate the national economy to get a 5 % raise . 
   someone will do it if it gets them votes . 
  and they will only notice that if people actually are supportive of such measures . 
  voters * are * supportive of these measures and voice their opinions too . 
  every single year the parliament increases their wages and there 's a huge uproar on facebook . 
  but ultimately , there are easier ways of getting votes . 
  like a one-time pension premium ( a.k.a. 
  legal vote buying ) , lowering utility costs for households ( and thus forcing the providers to raise the prices for large consumers , which ultimately presents itself as a raise in product prices , but it can be blamed easily onto the `` greedy bakers '' ) , etc. . . 
  as long as the lobbies continue to stuff their pockets , of course there is no visible difference . 
  however , as soon as , for example , the pro-israel lobby stopped paying , hollande would turn into the biggest supporter of palestinian rights . 
  so i 'll just ignore the sarcasm ... 
  i said their wages should be tied to the gdp/capita . 
  gdp is an external measure , harder to distort than the average wage . 
  it 's far from perfect , but it 's a pretty good indicator of the performance of the country . 
  the only problem is that i do n't see how this could be pushed through the parliament . 
  realpolitik sucks . 
  maybe some extremely populistic party that gets elected would make this change , but populists come with their own set of issues . 
  it is , kinda . 
  the latter implies some sort of loyalty . 
  the politicians have none . 
  politicians determine their own wage . 
  even if they implemented a system that bases the wage on the `` median wage '' , they will just redefine the concept of `` median wage '' .
