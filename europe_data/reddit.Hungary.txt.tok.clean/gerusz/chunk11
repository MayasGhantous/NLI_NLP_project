  say , they 'll consider themselves intellectual workers so they think they 'll have to receive the `` median wage of intellectual workers '' ( already above the normal median and since you ca n't count the unemployed as intellectual workers , they are out ) . 
  these are politicians . 
  obfuscation , double speech and lying through statistics is their fucking profession . 
  the only thing they serve is their own pockets . 
  the corruption and greed of the local politicians caused the problems . 
  obviously the eu politicians were glad to help as long as it stuffed their pockets too , but they alone do n't have the power to fuck things up this much . 
  yeah , right , except when you get to determine your own wage . 
  state capture , stagflation , a new tax every week , the only thing that allowed us to get out from the eu debt procedure was the abolition of private retirement funds and the theft of all the money that was in them ( 3 \\* 10 ^ 12 or so huf , around $ 10 ^ 10 ) which , in turn , fucked up the chances of the governments after 2020 or so , etc. . . 
  when they got into government , their first act was a flat tax rate . 
  they are scrambling to fill the hole it left on the budget ever since . 
  reduced funding of education , healthcare , etc. . . ( while fucking * soccer * gets more and more money and new stadiums - we have n't qualified for a world event since 1986 , just to put it in perspective ) . 
  every single government contract goes to companies that are owned by the same small group of people . 
  ok , this was n't different during the other governments either ... 
  the difference is that they are now redistributing private businesses too . 
  sounds weird ? 
  selling tobacco was fairly simple before . 
  then you had to apply for concession from the local government . 
  and , lo and behold , the * vast * majority of the businesses that got the concession belong to someone close to fidesz . 
  ( obviously , the applications are not public . ), 
  some where funded by the wife / nephew / uncle / brother-in-law / etc. . . of the major just for this purpose . 
  pharmacies seem to be the next and i wo n't be surprised if , based on the `` success '' of the tobacco concession , they 'll announce the same for alcohol . 
  but it looks like their propaganda machine is working . 
  they are using chomsky 's 10 points as a checklist , so it should n't be surprising . 
  the problem with that is that they are the ones making the statistics . 
  they would just drive out the industries that are providing low-wage jobs and ignore unemployment . 
  x \\* ( gdp/capita ) ? 
  yeah , our politicians are stacking positions , earning 3-4 times as much as displayed . 
  also , they should have used a picture of an actual mp , not a former president ( who is the head of state , not the head of government ) . 
  not as long as the people of these countries blame the rest of the eu before they start blaming their own politicians . 
  and themselves , of course , for expecting `` free '' services from the government while making tax evasion a national pastime . 
  though that 's also the responsibility of the politicians ; the more they steal , the more likely it is for otherwise moral people to dodge the taxes . 
  chronologically : * ** \u00c1rp\u00e1d , el\u0151d , ond , kond , tas , huba , t\u00f6h\u00f6t\u00f6m ** - the 7 chieftains who led the hungarians into the karpathian basin in 895-896 . 
  * ** istv\u00e1n i ** ( stephen ) , first king of hungary , crowned in 1000 after a civil war with kopp\u00e1ny , his uncle . 
  interestingly , ** kopp\u00e1ny ** is highly popular too , probably because he is played customarily by the stronger actor / singer in the rock opera about them and , well , in the same opera he makes some damned good points ( even though its historical accuracy is a bit ... iffy sometimes ) . 
  national hero of pretty much every nation in the area . 
  without him mehmet ii would have taken n\u00e1ndorfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r ( belgrade ) and then a considerable amount of eastern and central europe . 
  supreme political and military leader . 
  renaissance king . 
  still , during his rule the country reached its largest territory ever . 
  died without an heir . 
  is called `` m\u00e1ty\u00e1s the just '' , with many folk tales being centered around him walking around the country incognito , dispensing justice and rewarding cleverness . 
  he probably did n't do this . 
  * ** istv\u00e1n dob\u00f3 ** and the defenders of eger . 
  the siege of eger is one of the best known sieges in hungarian history because it 's the central event of the book * egri csillagok * ( lit . 
  : stars of eger , official english title : eclipse of the crescent moon ) , one of the few mandatory readings that are actually enjoyable . 
  the women of eger are considered fierce to this day because they actively took part in the defense . 
  * ** ferenc r\u00e1k\u00f3czi ** - lead an uprising against the habsburgs , failed . 
  lived his life in exile , mentioned at the end of voltaire 's candide . 
  * ** the heroes of 1848-49 ** - too numerous to list individually . 
  to sum it up , there was an independence war , after initial successes the uprising was crushed after the russians intervened . 
  however , certain political achievements have remained . 
  * ** ferenc de\u00e1k ** , though lesser-known than the rest . 
  after the revolution was crushed , the revenge of the habsburgs was brutal . 
  de\u00e1k started a passive resistance movement which was enough to make a compromise with the habsburgs . 
  thus austria-hungary was born . 
  * ** the heroes of 1956 ** - again , numerous . 
  the revolution had initial successes and was later crushed by the russians . 
  however , certain political achievements remained . 
  after initial brutal retorsions ( see a pattern ? 
  ) , hungary became the most relaxed communist country . 
  it 's still disputed whether it was good or not . 
  common joke all over europe : \\ - what do you call a hot woman in the uk ? 
  \\ - a tourist, 
  `` two hungarians have three different opinions . '', 
  strand two hungarians on a deserted island and they 'll be dead in three days because they could n't agree on who should go find water . 
  we have the same . 
  similarly true . 
  they are predicting 30-33 \u00b0 c for thursday and friday . 
  but then again , here i do n't trust their predictions for the next * hour * , so it might be a snowfall or something . 
  hungary : nope . 
  our student ids have a chip since 2000 or so . 
  in the 12 years i had a student id i have n't used it as a smartcard once . 
  they 'll be part of oceania anyway . 
  cameron fucked up . 
  he should have started with other types of content . 
  taking away porn is noticeable for a lot of people ( remember the research when they tried to find differences between men who watched porn and men who did n't but could n't go through with it because they * could n't find a man who did n't watch porn * ? ) . 
  this decision wo n't be popular . 
  thank fuck they are too goddamn incompetent to properly implement 1984 ... 
  mostly in a car , yes . 
  i 'd love if the webradio i 'm listening to constantly was available on fm without data costs , but that 's not going to happen . 
  in hungary they just banned them . 
  after they transferred tobacco sales to the hands of people close to the government , of course . 
  not for * this * specific summer , but these are evergreen . 
  if you have ever eaten l\u00e1ngos by the balaton , you have heard them . 
  heard them all . 
  a thousand times . 
  every day . 
  [ ufo - napolaj ( sunscreen ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=k8rdaskaftw ) [ kov\u00e1cs eszti - pancsol\u00f3 kisl\u00e1ny ( bathing little girl ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=emht2ddokcs ) [ 4f club - balatoni l\u00e1z ( balaton fever ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=erkhlypyvrs ) [ fresh - b\u00facs\u00fazik a ny\u00e1r ( summer says goodbye ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=xil2time1me ) and [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=akj7p012owk ) is what they claim to be the summer hit of 2013 . 
  i guess i 'll stick with metal for another summer . 
  we would instantly arrest him and hand him to the us while our politicians would be telling the people that we tried to help him , but some cia and nsa agents have got him first . 
  on a related note , i do n't know why are they renaming `` zu guttenberg '' - his original name is extremely appropriate as guttenberg pretty much developed a way to make copying easier . 
  ( in hungarian it 's schmittelni - to schmitt , after former dr. p\u00e1l schmitt , former head of state forced to resign after losing his doctorate for plagiarism ), 
  i think the biggest flaw is the electorate . 
  especially because 48 out of 50 states and dc are winner-takes-it-all which effectively kills the chances of any third party ( libertarians , greens , etc. . . ) . 
  and these states might effectively ignore the votes of more than the half of the population !, 
  ( example : 43 % democrats , 44 % republicans , 13 % third party - republicans win the state , 56 % of the votes are ignored . ), 
  however , to change it the two parties would have to agree to amend the constitution and they wo n't change anything that benefits them . 
  if the slovakian parliament works like the rest , they can just send it back unchanged and the president then * has * to sign it despite his concerns . 
  i guess it clashes with the eu directives of `` free movement of products , capital and workforce '' . 
  no , our country is producing * tons * of porn but we 're calling it what it is .
