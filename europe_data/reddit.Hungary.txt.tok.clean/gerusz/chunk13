  i do n't know if they considered our new constitution ( defining marriage as something between a man and a woman - no , we did n't have gay marriage before , but it was a simple law that could have been changed rather easily - changing it in the constitution requires 2/3 of the votes ) . 
   the study , led by the former ceo of french pay-tv channel canal plus , pierre lescure and there 's the problem here , massive conflict of interest . 
  yes , it 's a mistranslation . 
  from another article ( [ from tasz , as bleeding-heart liberal as possible ] ( http://tasz.hu/node/3532 ) ) it 's obvious that they were found guilty in `` crime against a community '' , essentially hungarian legalese for `` hate crime '' . 
  there 's actually a category in hungarian criminal law called something like `` crimes against the nation '' , it essentially covers treason and related crimes . 
  the reason it was classified as a hate crime ( which is conveniently omitted from the article ) is that they allegedly shouted `` you 'll die stinky hungarians '' when they attacked the car . 
  if hungarians attacked gypsies shouting `` you 'll die stinky gypsies '' , they would get the maximal sentence , especially because every international news outlet would be following it closely , with tasz and a bunch of other organizations organizing protests in front of the courthouse . 
  if there 's convincing evidence ( as in : something other than witness testimony ; i could imagine that a magyar g\u00e1rda car driving through the gypsy row had a dashboard camera ) that the attackers shouted `` you 'll die stinky hungarians '' , then i agree with the sentence . 
  if not , it should be a `` simple '' assault ( with a weapon ) . 
  yup , i 've also seen this chart , though it ends in 2009 . 
  some horrible crime-ridden shitholes with a higher burglary / capita rate than germany : * uk * france * italy * the netherlands * austria * sweden * switzerland, 
  well , that 's 360 burglaries per day = 131,490 burglaries per year for a country of 81 million , which is 1.62 burglaries per 1000 citizens . 
  this is far from a bad statistic , many countries have much more burglaries per capita . 
  the only typefaces with straight acutes and hungarumlauts ( the double acute on \u0151 and \u0171 ) are some engineering typefaces . 
  and only on small letters , a straight up acute on a capital \u00d3 , for example , would add a lot of height . 
  same in hungary - while it 's technically qwertz ( usually ) , we have a bunch of additional letters ( \u00ed , \u00f6 , \u00fc , \u00f3 , \u0151 , \u00fa , \u0171 , \u00e1 , \u00e9 ) . 
  these sites ( especially the uk ones ) seem to think that merkel gets off on the thoughts of austerity . 
  `` yes !, 
  cut the healthcare budget , you naughty boy !, 
  more !, 
  more !, 
  do n't stop ! '', 
  or something . 
  i do n't think merkel would be `` angry '' for the netherlands not having more austerity as long as the budget is stable . 
  what democratic control ? 
  how could a * country * cede control of the * privately owned factories * from the * owners * ( who invested their money expecting some returns ) to the employees ? 
  do n't you realize that it is a gross violation of property rights , which is essentially a * totalitarian * move ? 
  buy enough shares , get some control . 
  that fucking simple . 
  yes , this . 
  communism and socialism does n't work with scarcity . 
  and we 're far from post-scarcity . 
  education is more expensive than you imagine . 
  r&d is even more expensive . 
  europe still has an edge over developing countries . 
  we should keep and increase this advantage so we could produce more , higher-quality products cheaper . 
  * then * we might have enough money to have an actual safety net . 
  also , socialism and communism * is * slavery . 
  currently if you have a marketable skill , you can choose your employer , get a better wage or even found your own company . 
  you ca n't do that if there 's only one employer . 
  as for `` making some wealthy while the others are poor '' check every country east of the iron curtain before 1990 . 
  or north korea . 
  yeah , in communism or socialism there 's no inequality , right ... 
  we can always try communism again , the post-communist countries are doing * soooooooo * well . 
  yay !, 
  we suck at another statistics !, 
  alternative 1 : we should invest in education and sciences . 
  get a technological edge and keep it . 
  alternative 2 : most people should accept a reduction in their quality of life . 
  2 $ is more than the minimal wage in hungary . 
  if everybody takes the same reduction , rent and service costs would decrease too , meaning that while the quality of life would decrease , it would n't be extremely unbearable . 
  well , i 'm a broke-ass hungarian student living in maastricht , so if you 're living nearby and are really interested ... 
  if you like swearing , then yes . 
  otherwise , not so much . 
  well , banks could be more flexible with rescheduling loans and pausing payment . 
  it 's better to get the same amount ( or more , with interests ) of money in a little more time than getting a house when the real estate bubble is bursting . 
  also , the government could encourage people to make some money out of their houses - decrease the tax on income from rent , for example . 
  still , calling * this * a crisis in the current economy is like calling a flu a serious illness in the oncology ward . 
  0.9 % recession , 7 % unemployment , 71 % debt and they call * that * a crisis ? 
  cute . 
  yes . 
  the police can only deny the permission for a small list of reasons ( like blocking traffic ) , but some reasons are too damn flexible . 
  maastricht ; the same . 
  what ? 
  ( 27 % vat in hungary ), 
  i do n't think any country is actually obliged to join the euro ( uk , sweden , etc. . . ) . 
  neither schengen ( uk ) , though it would be smart for tourism . 
  * if * the eu or a part of eu becomes a true federal state in the future , then it will be obligatory , but i do n't see that becoming a reality in this generation . 
  to be fair , we are in a recession , but that 's not the eu 's fault . 
   implying we 'll * ever * have euro, 
  you 'll have euro sooner than us ... 
  usually . 
  sometimes it gets confusing . 
  usually you can get away with substituting them to \u00f6 , \u00fc or something similar ( common in sms messages , because \u00f6 and \u00fc are parts of the standard sms character set ( 7-bit encoding ) thus allow 160 characters per message , while a single \u0151 or \u0171 ( and \u00e1 , \u00ed , \u00f3 and \u00fa as well , i have to use the grave accent instead of the acute ) switches the charset to a 16-bit encoding , allowing only 67 characters per text or so . ), 
  however , there are some words that have a different meaning with hungarumlauts than with simple umlauts . 
  i ca n't say one from the top of my head , but there are . 
  well , these carnivals are not about `` politely asking winter to go away '' ... 
  [ bus\u00f3j\u00e1r\u00e1s ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bus%c3%b3 ), 
   `` we want work , not gay marriage '' said no wedding planner ever . 
  seriously , gay marriage is a fucking stimulus package !, 
  for free !, 
  ~ 10 % of the population is homosexual . 
  this is not the medieval age , homosexuals are n't forced to marry someone of the opposite gender , so we can assume that the vast majority of them is unmarried and childless ( i assume that adoption was also an issue ) . 
  being childless means more disposable income . 
  even if only 50 % of them are adult and want to marry , it 's now 5 % of the population . 
  so ... 5 % of the population of france ( that 's 3.25 million people , or 1.625 million couples ) are going to pay thousands of euros each to french companies in the service sector in the next years . 
  also , some couples will have children ( sperm donation , surrogate mothers , adoption , etc. . . ) which might remove one of them from the job market , creating another opening . 
  in fact , gay marriage might end up creating jobs . 
  no government effort can integrate them if they do n't want to integrate . 
  also , good luck finding \u0151 and \u0171 in any font other than the default fonts . 
  or on your non-hungarian keyboard layout . 
  wait . 
  so ... lem me get this straight . 
  cyprus is in deep shit . 
  the troika offers them a bailout with some conditions ( they have to somehow get $ 5.8 billion so they could get another $ 10 billion ) . 
  they do n't give a damn * how * cyprus gets that money . 
  they did n't tell cyprus to steal the deposits of the people . 
  they might have implied that they could tax the offshore deposits . 
  then the cypriot politicians are proposing a law that will effectively steal 6.75 % of the savings of average people too , not only the offshore accounts . 
  and then the people become angry .
