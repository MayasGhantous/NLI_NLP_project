  * people are friendly . 
  * low crime . 
  bike theft is bad here due to the amount of bikes , but otherwise i 'm not afraid even in the darkest corners of the city . 
  or maybe i 'm just conditioned to the viii . 
  district of budapest , who knows ... con : * pretty much every popular nightlife spot is an iso standard club . 
  with the same 10-15 tracks playing over and over again . 
  and i hate iso standard clubs . 
  yeah , and beer is 2 $ / 2dl . 
  in hungary you get 5 dl for that in clubs and 1l in some bars !, 
  * lack of trees . 
  no , not weed , there are coffeeshops ... but actual trees . 
  i 've never noticed this while living there , but budapest is a very green city with trees growing on the sides of most main roads , even in the inner city . 
  i miss them . 
  * the weather , especially now . 
  you can choose : wind from north , strong , brings a lot of rain but not so cold or wind from the south , strong , dry but very cold . 
  sometimes the two follow each other , so it 's cold * and * raining . 
  and i have n't even started to talk about the occasional bouts of arctic and siberian air . 
  * barely any public transport . 
  i never thought i would say this , but i miss the bkv ( fellow hungarians will understand why i never thought that i would say this ) . 
  * restaurants are expensive . 
  at least i had to practice cooking . 
  wwi would have been postponed for another 10 years or so , probably started at a different front ( the system of alliances in europe meant that pretty much any war would have led to wwi ) , probably started by germany instead . 
  wwii could have been averted , depending on the peace treaties at the end of wwi . 
  if the federation actually functioned well , it could have become the core ( and the example ) of eu instead of the benelux states . 
  or there would be two eus , one comprised of the benelux states , the scandinavian states , france , uk , germany , spain and portugal and the other , united states of europe including the former austro-hungarian empire , poland , bulgaria and some of the balkan states . 
  who knows . 
  maybe an alt-history sci-fi could explore it , but i 'm not a writer . 
  there were some people who urged for a second ausgleich with the minorities , but wwi kind of interrupted everything . 
  [ ferenc de\u00e1k ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferenc_de%c3%a1k ) was probably the greatest hungarian statesman ( not politician , it 's a different category ) . 
  he made the [ austro-hungarian compromise ( kiegyez\u00e9s , ausgleich ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austro-hungarian_compromise_of_1867 ) possible , which was followed by almost 50 years of prosperity . 
  hungary : * t\u00far\u00f3 ( cottage cheese ) . 
  we 're using it in far more dishes than other people - even in desserts , in lieu of mascarpone . 
  * tejf\u00f6l ( sour cream ) . 
  we 're using a lot . 
  here in the netherlands i can only find 1 dl packages - at home i could easily get 1 l packs . 
  * csalam\u00e1d\u00e9 ( pickled vegetable mix , usually cabbage , pickles , paprika , tomato , carrots , etc. . . ) . 
  in hamburgers . 
  it probably originates from the time when we did n't have mcdonald 's and only knew that a hamburger is supposed to be some meat loaf in a patty with vegetables . 
  nowadays it 's advertised as `` retro burger '' . 
  * mulled wine . 
  the default smell of every christmas market in the country . 
  it 's usually sold from stalls on the street all winter long . 
  * roasted chestnut . 
  have n't seen it anywhere else . 
  usually sold by street vendors . 
  * and a bunch of things listed here by others ( soup in bread , though only in restaurants , coffee is espresso by default because our coffee culture is the same as austria 's , many people put ketchup on pizza ( though i do n't , it usually ruins it ) , mustard with everything , gyros a.k.a. 
  d\u00f6ner kebab as our default drunk food , etc. . . ), 
  ( or more accurately , zs\u00edrszalonna - `` fat salo '' . 
  hungarian szalonna usually has at least some meat . ), 
  same here . 
  apetizers are usually spirits . 
  but it actually cures a hangover . 
  this man speaks the truth . 
  since i moved to the netherlands i 've been eating potatoes on a more-or-less daily basis . 
  we also do it . 
  in hungary guns are nearly impossible to get legally ( getting sport weapons is n't that hard , but you ca n't carry them loaded ; self-defense weapons are practically impossible unless you are some high-ranking politician or someone who can bribe the police ) . 
  however , if i really wanted to shoot up a school , i know exactly where i can get an ak-47 and frag grenades for beads . 
  and i 'm not even well-connected . 
  and if i was really shooting up a school , i would n't really worry about an `` illegal ownership of firearms '' charge . 
  the problem in the us is n't the right to bear arms , it 's the fact that they do n't have free mental healthcare . 
  honestly , i do n't have a problem with multiculturalism - if implemented sanely . 
  i do n't give a flying fuck about what language they are speaking at home ( as long as they speak a widely spoken language - i could say the language of the country , but it would be hypocritical as i still do n't speak dutch ... but it 's hard when everybody is speaking english ) , what they are cooking ( as long as it 's not human ) , what they are singing , dancing , which divinity they are praying for , etc. . . * as long as they adopt a minimal set of the cultural values of their adoptive country * . 
  sadly , you ca n't attack a certain part of a culture because the bleeding-heart liberals will be at your throat immediately . 
  if i , for example , said that the gypsies need to erase the word `` gajo '' from their vocabulary as it separates them from the society as whole and dehumanizes the non-gypsy people ( `` who cares that i beat him up and took his phone , he was just a gajo '' ) , i would immediately become an oppressive fascist . 
  it really depends . 
  i never exchanged kisses with male friends , but i know some who do . 
  * strangers : no , maybe in very informal settings ( bar ) * relatives : sometimes , though males kissing male relatives is dying out * friends : mostly female-female and male-female . 
  male-male kissing exists , but it 's considered kind of douchy . 
  * business partners : no , never . 
  * men + women : only in informal settings * women + women : also only in informal settings * men + men : very rarely , informal settings only * how many : varies ; 3 is the most frequent in my experience . 
  it can get awkward . 
  * mostly air . 
  actual cheek-kissing is restricted to relatives , mouth-kissing in intimate settings . 
  hand kissing is rare . 
  * usually after several hours * instead of kissing : handshakes . 
  yes , they should exclude anyone not mixed-race from every beauty pageant because there are n't lots of ethnically 100 % homogeneous countries ... / s, 
  [ a tanu ( the witness ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_witness_\\ ( 1969_hungarian_film \\ ) ) . 
  unfortunately , it does n't only describe communist hungary . 
  romania is n't exactly on the balkans ( only the dobruja territory is considered to be on the balkans ) . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balkans#definitions_and_boundaries i only included slovenia because it was a part of yugoslavia . 
  on the sidebar , `` readers '' is replaced with `` europhiles '' . 
  europhile literally means `` europe lover '' . 
  the subreddit calls every one of their readers `` europhile '' . 
  the base of the joke is that by reading the sub , you call yourself an europhile . 
  it 's a joke , ffs !, 
  neither did i , i just know some words . 
  balkans and other former yugoslavian countries : * just south of austria is slovenia . 
  do n't mix it up with slovakia . 
  * the country that called dibs on most of the adrian shore is croatia * the country with the longest border with croatia is giles_duceppticon 's country , bosnia and herzegovina * the `` longest '' country east of croatia and bosnia-herzegovina is serbia * the tiny country next to serbia with a shore is montenegro ( or crna gora , both means `` black mountain '' ) . 
  * the other tiny country next to serbia without a shore is kosovo * the country neighboring both montenegro and kosovo and has a shore is albania * the southernmost country is greece * the country between greece and serbia is macedonia ( fyrom ) . 
  * and finally , the country on the balkans with an access to the black sea is bulgaria, 
  but belarusia actually means whiterussia in russian so ... 
  look at the sidebar !, 
  i liked within temptation before i moved to the netherlands , so it counts , i guess . 
  and of course a bunch of scandinavian metal bands ( in flames , nightwish , pain of salvation , etc. . . ) and some german ones ( edguy , rammstein ) . 
  and i guess some others as well , i 'm just too lazy to check the nationalities of some bands . 
  hungarian here : we refer to austrians as `` s\u00f3gorok '' ( `` brothers-in-law '' ) . 
  other than our brotherhood with the polish , many feel like finland is our cousin and those who know a bit more of the finno-ugric language family also consider estonia as some distant cousin too . 
  45/45 , piece of cake . 
  and you call yourselves europhiles with your 44 correct answers ?
