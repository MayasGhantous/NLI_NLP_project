  not a lot of votes there , i mean even if somehow they all got citizenship before the next elections and voted for the left , the far right gains a lot more votes . 
  yes , and your opinion is that they are cowards who are abandoning their family for free handouts , whereas i think they are using whatever opportunity they get to provide for their families . 
  there are `` statistics '' about the gender and age of the refugees ( well , there are photos and i 'm not one to deny evidence when i see it ) , but there are no statistics about their marital status yet because bureaucracy is slow . 
  i guess germany is going to be the fastest in approving / denying the requests ( german companies are up in the bureaucrats ' asses because they want access to a bunch of new , cheap workers which they ca n't do until their legal status is cleared ) , we might see some statistics about reunification requests in a couple of months . 
  until then i would n't consider them cowards . 
  much like yours , yeah . 
  we 'll see actual statistics once they start getting refugee status in germany and apply for reunification . 
  getting from a refugee camp in turkey to europe costs money . 
  the families you see are the ones who could afford it for the entire family . 
  for the rest , their family is probably in a refugee camp in turkey , jordan or lebanon ( safe ) , they could only afford to get the men to europe ( the trek is not easy ) . 
  once they get the refugee status , they can apply for family reunification and just fly their families in . 
  i do n't think this is hard to understand , but apparently it 's not `` common sense '' . 
  the syrian civil war was pretty much caused by global warming . 
  several years of drought ruined their agriculture , forcing the farmers ( who were n't rich , but were doing ok before ) to move to the cities for work , which they did n't really found . 
  poverty led to restlessness , which led to demonstrations against the government , which assad brutally crushed , escalating it to a civil war . 
  at the same time the us decided to withdraw from iraq allowing isis to be founded and conquer parts of the country . 
  now iraq and syria were pretty much mirror images of each other ( iraq a shia majority country led by a sunni dictator , syria a sunni majority country led by a shia dictator , this made both of them fairly secular ... ) , and isis was founded from the remnants of saddam 's supporters . 
  the syrian civil war also gave an opportunity for the local sunni extremists to rise against the government and isis quickly co-opted their cause , leading to the current situation . 
  but did n't you know ? 
  muslims are allowed to lie to non-believers ^ * so anytime a muslim is talking about peace and integration , he must be lying !, 
  ^ ( * ) : of course in the original text it 's only to escape persecution by the other branch of muslims , but we all know they ca n't be trusted ! \u2122 ^ ^ ^ ^ / s , ^ ^ ^ ^ my ^ ^ ^ ^ sarcasm ^ ^ ^ ^ switch ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ stuck . 
  it 's the muslim major that gave it away , is n't it ? 
  ( the same major who told muslims to integrate or gtfo . ), 
  even with 6 children per immigrant family that would take ~ 1.6 million immigrants settled in hungary . 
  permanently . 
  then they need 3 years to get a citizenship ( and not get deported the second syria is considered safe ) if they actually receive the refugee status in hungary , they need to have a job and they must speak hungarian well enough to take the citizenship exam . 
  or they need to get a visa , or face deportation . 
  now considering that a ) there are n't enough jobs in hungary , b ) hungarian is notoriously difficult , especially because some of them have to learn latin script as well and c ) * maybe * syria will be stabilized by then ( which would lead to them losing refugee status and having to request a visa and wait 8 years in total , unless they marry a hungarian citizen and have a child , in which case it 's 5 ) , it 's at least unlikely that hungarians would become a minority in hungary anytime soon . 
  but keep up the good propaganda work !, 
  yeah , it 's so hard to be a white non-muslim in the netherlands . 
  even the major is muslim , i ca n't buy beer , i ca n't eat pork , i have to listen to muezzins five times a day , women have to walk around in burqa ( if they are even allowed outside , it 's discouraged ) ... ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ sarcasm-impaired, 
  exactly . 
  the purpose of terrorism is to spread fear . 
  why would they send anyone when they can just * say * they sent a lot of people and the european politicians will do the rest ? 
  `` kept busy '' ? 
  i ca n't really tell without an original source . 
  rite of spring caused riots in the theater . 
  literally . 
  two-tailed dog party . 
  ( hungary ), 
  people love to consider migrants as robots . 
  or at least the perfect examples of a homo economicus with a very skewed utility function . 
  that 's nothing new . 
  i have a comment in a worldnews thread about the dehumanization rhetoric of some people . 
  during the european day it went to +18 -20 . 
  then came the evening / night ( or as the americans know it , `` day '' ) , right now it 's -6 . 
  might be a coincidence , but i doubt it . 
  but ... but ... then some white people would have * brown neighbors * !, 
  ** the horror !, 
  ** ^ ^ ^ / s , ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ sarcasm-impaired, 
  do you think they are all fanatical islamists ? 
  seriously ? 
  looks like the propaganda of dehumanization is working . 
  i bet you would be ok with gunning them down on our borders . 
  if the `` christian identity '' of the continent can be wiped out by immigrants who would only make up less than 1 % of europe 's population , then it deserves to be wiped out . 
  it 's like ... people think that every muslim is part of a hive mind , unable to think for themselves , unable to change their religion ( especially when they wo n't be sentenced for it ) and only wants to destroy europe and its culture by outbreeding the natives and turning the countries into sharia-califates . 
  and then you 're cheering for a jack-off like orb\u00e1n when today 's dose of populist drivel from his mouth happens to agree with this view . 
  fuck you all , seriously . 
  fuck you . 
  approximately 5 % higher maybe ( that 's the dutch deficit ) . 
  that 's not `` much '' . 
  yes , and i pay enough taxes over that amount to cover those and subsidize those who ca n't / do n't pay taxes . 
  someone somewhere in that chain between the allocation and the usage of the money is stealing a lot . 
  * that is more than my yearly net wage , as a programmer !, 
  * someone somewhere is stealing most of it . 
  that seems somewhat ... inefficient . 
  where is the money leaking out of the system ? 
  or because back in the 7th century wine was the strongest alcohol you could get , hence it was the easiest way to get drunk . 
  ( distillation was known to the medieval arabs , but they did n't have distilled drinks . ), 
  it 's in biking range of maastricht , assuming you have something better than a rusty omafiets . 
  worm ( well , a kind of worm , we have at least three words for different kinds ) , but probably related to the same word . 
  for anyone interested , it 's `` kukac '' . 
  ouch . 
  in hungary too . 
  protip : it 's great for an instant date . 
  compared to that , a bucket of cold water seems tame . 
  well ... 
  i looked him up a bit a few days ago . 
  most of what he promises is already implemented in europe ( except for the $ 15 minimal wage , which i think is insane and it 's essentially banking on the continued exploitation of third-world workers to increase the level of life for the american workers ... the ones who do n't get their jobs outsourced to said third world countries , that is ) . 
  however , even if he somehow became the d candidate and got elected , he would never push them through the senate or the congress . 
  merkel & co. : get the greek budget balanced , push the reforms through the greek government and people , and then once things on that front are quieter , introduce a repayment moratorium on greek debts for 20-30 years and spin up ez inflation to ~ 1.5-2 % , effectively giving greece a huge debt cut and a smaller one to the rest of the ez countries . 
  at least i think that is their endgame ; giving greece a nominal debt relief now would set up a bad precedent ( every other poorer ez country will want the same ) and cause the hardliner ez countries to lose face , but not giving them any debt relief would make their debt unsustainable . 
  greek government : get reelected < - keep their campaign promises < - no austerity or anything that can be perceived as austerity . 
  that looks very kerbal . 
  he 'd more likely order his goons to take all your money . 
  the two-tailed dog party because fuck hungarian politics . 
  it 's because gypsies do n't have their country ( jokes about romania aside ) . 
  in other words : parliament full of wankers . 
  and a train station . 
  the iron bank always gets its due . 
  and do you seriously think that the entire population of those countries will just pack up and leave for europe ? 
  yep , that 's a fairly common mistake we make . 
  they hit reliably ... at 22 \u00b0 c , 20 % humidity and 101368 pa. . warranty void if exposed to different conditions . 
  i do n't carry a lot of cash , but i 'll check anyway . 
  i live in the netherlands : * greek : 1 * spanish : 1 * portuguese : 1 * french : 2 * dutch : 5 ( all of them with the picture of beatrix ) * belgian : 1 * german : 2 ( had to look up which one is the oak twig ) * finnish : 1 ( the `` special '' lion ), 
  they could ask hungary then , the peng\u0151 still has the world record for hyperinflation . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hyperinflation#hungary  when the peng\u0151 was replaced in august 1946 by the forint , the total value of all hungarian banknotes in circulation amounted to 1/1 ,000 of one us dollar . 
  it is the most severe known incident of inflation recorded , peaking at 1.3 \u00d7 10 ^ 16 percent per month ( prices double every 15 hours ) . 
  they could send them trillions !, 
  additionally , many of the reforms being demanded would still be more favorable compared to what hungary has already implemented !,
