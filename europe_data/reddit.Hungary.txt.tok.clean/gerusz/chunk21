  hungary would kill for only 23 % . 
  and even the `` skyrocketed '' greek suicide rate is much lower than hungary 's in a good year . 
  so that is why greece wo n't get any sympathy from hungary either . 
  [ brilliant ] ( http://www.volkskrant.nl/foto/de-cartoons-van-jos-collignon~p3761431/2975608/ ), 
  you should escape the closing parenthesis in the link ( i.e. 
  put a \\ \\ in front of it ) . 
  no , because of the gift . 
  we used to try killing the larvae , but there was no money for that in the last couple of years . 
  it was 3 years ago ? 
  woah . 
  when people say that time feels faster as you get older , they are n't joking . 
  meh , i get them ( first is by gender , men then women , second by age , third i assume is `` finished education '' ) , but pretty much every other european language starts their `` no '' with an `` n '' ( even hungarian ) . 
  welp , i give up . 
  i might be able to * read * greek , but i 'll never understand it . 
  ok , i 'm confused . 
  i get that nai is `` no '' and oxi is `` yes '' ... but at this point , which one is what ? 
  we have the danube , so it gets humid there too ... 
  this is when you need us , central-european peons ... 
  i 'm literally laughing at my colleagues who think this is hot . 
  wimps . 
  sincerely , the only person who was in the office for at least something approximating 8 hours ( in the netherlands ) . 
  until they learn that there is a 3-month waiting list for a fucking ekg . 
  actual terrorists are already using it anyway . 
  what if you `` forget '' the key ? 
  the ones at the bottom of the subcontractor chain do n't always get paid in time ... or at all . 
  they are building unnecessary stadiums , i think gladiator fights could be held in them . 
  however , they are not so great on the `` providing bread '' front ... 
  iirc the labour laws said before that everyone working full-time has to have two rest days per week , and one of them must be on the weekends . 
  and they were paid extra ( twice as much , in fact ; the current government reduced this extra pay to +50 % ) ,, 
  higher bonuses for getting to work on time . 
  you 've got nothing on hungarians when it comes to complaining ( do n't , under any circumstances , ask a hungarian `` how are you '' as a way of saying hello ) , but 30 \u00b0 c in budapest is nothing extraordinary . 
  90 % of the people in the office are working from home ( i live in the netherlands ) . 
  they were complaining for the whole day yesterday . 
  we hungarians just call this `` july '' . 
  hell , right now it 's only 30 , that 's not even july , maybe late may or june . 
  44 % of the voters , which amounted to 27 % of the total population , yeah . 
  well , the `` other '' has spent 10 times this amount from public money on the anti-immigration billboards and 30 times on a `` national consultation '' ( basically mailing polls to the populace then lying about the results ) . 
  yep , that 's the point . 
  stores ( especially the big ones ) were open on sundays until now . 
  half of the people did their big weekly grocery shopping on saturday , half of them on sunday . 
  mostly because single-income families are not typical ( in fact , unless that single income is exceptionally good , it 's unsustainable ) , neither are part-time work or flexible-time , so most families ca n't manage their shopping on weekdays . 
  ( as a secondary effect , many stores are now open until 22:00 every weekday to lower the load on saturday , which is the legal limit - meaning that the people doing the closing wo n't arrive home before 23:00 . 
  but they can be together with their families on sundays , yay . ), 
  but right now some of those countries are reconsidering it . 
  meanwhile in hungary stores could be open on sundays for decades now , people got used to it , and there come the fucking `` christian democrats '' with their `` let the families of retail workers be together on sundays '' bs and turn the weekend grocery shopping into a nightmare . 
  more than 70 % of the population ( even those who are sympathizing with the government ) are against this and want the stores to be open on sundays . 
  the last time people could vote on them as an independent party they got 2.59 % of the votes ( and did n't get into the parliament ) . 
  that was in 1998 . 
  they tried to get into the parliament together with another minor party in 2002 , the two parties together got 3.9 % of the votes ( and failed to get in , as it required 5 % ) . 
  since then they just latched onto fidesz . 
  so a party with a support that ca n't be measured forced through a law that 70 + % of the population opposes . 
  they are slavic in origin : `` middle '' , `` fourth day '' , `` fifth day '' . 
  ( the same days in modern slovenian : sreda , \u010dtrtek , petek ) . 
   * collect taxes = people can not pay and moreover a huge factor is that taxes are not fair ( they are horizontal cutbacks ) . the taxes must be fair . 
   * working social systems = no money no honey ... especially with a public sector that is cut by 33 % and has not enough doctors , teachers and taxmen of course they do n't have money for the social systems * if they do n't fucking collect the taxes !, 
  any bets that it will be postponed again before june 2017 ? 
  that , and there was a bit of a recession recently ... 
  who forced them to watch it ? 
  it was n't an anti-smoking measure , it was a pro-steal-the-whole-tobacco-market-and-give-it-to-our-people measure . 
  wilders is an idiot but muslims getting offended by fucking cartoons are even bigger idiots . 
  he had every right to show these cartoons though , and i support that right - even if you consider this an abuse of freedom of expression , it 's a lot better for foe to be abused than for censorship . 
  the atomium fallen apart ? 
  i do n't know . 
  they were bad everywhere , but i do n't know . 
  i was n't alive back then . 
  1 +3 = why hungarians are depressed , resulting in chart # 4 . 
  and chart # 3 does n't even include the 27 % vat . 
  highest fucking vat in the world . 
  i buy them for the booklets . 
  zimbabwe still has nothing on the [ peng\u0151 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_peng%c5%91 ) . 
  but yeah , especially if they try to solve all of their problems with printing money , it will end up like that . 
   the new bonds will in drachma for sure , are you really sure that the old loans also will converted to drachma ? 
  no , i 'm not . 
  that 's why i started with `` afaik '' - i might very well be wrong . 
   example : old loan of 100 $ with euro as currency , after switching to drachma , with 1 drachma for 10 euro 's , the former 100 euro loan would now be 1000 drachma ? 
  true , but they could then just print 1000 drachma and hand it to the creditors when they come knocking . 
  it obviously has the risks of hyperinflation . 
  and even if they do , once they have a majority sufficient for changes in the constitution . 
   the debt will still remain in euro even if they change there currency . 
  the part with leaving the eu i do n't get at all . 
  afaik the greek state bonds would be converted to drachma , which is probably a large part of the debt . 
  i was just saying that they ca n't top the actual announcements of the government , so they might as well give up . 
  the day h\u00edrcs\u00e1rda ( our version of the onion ) said `` fuck , we give up '' . 
  we do , but it 's just assumed regarding every state-funded ( or eu-funded ) construction here , so it 's not worth mentioning . 
  they could , y' know , start paying healthcare professionals better . 
  emigration has a huge emotional cost . 
  you 're giving up the ability to meet with your friends , be with your family , etc. . . a 5-6x increase in wage can offset this cost but for most people i know a 2x increase would n't . 
  but then the politicians would n't be able to steal as much , so this is never going to happen . 
  i live in the netherlands and frequently go for weeks without going anywhere near an atm . 
  the only thing i regularly pay for in cash is the lunch money pool at work . 
  as a hungarian living in the netherlands ... no . 
  you merely adopted complaining . 
  i was born in it , molded by it . 
  i 've never heard another person not complaining for 10 minutes until i was a grown man . 
  is automod out for combinations of `` kill '' and `` fruit '' ? 
  is n't that slur a bit ... old-timey ? 
  or an alternate timeline where yugoslavia dissolved to its current states in 1991 . 
  familiar , is n't it ? 
  plus kickstarted the revisionist movements by stranding 1/3 of the hungarians in foreign countries . 
  this directly led to hungary joining the axis instead of staying neutral and/or getting conquered .
