  this probably led to the western allies not sticking to the agreement made with stalin at the yalta conference ( [ churchill 's plan to have a 50/50 western allies - soviet control over hungary , ok-d by stalin ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/churchill_si_crucificarea_romaniei.jpg ) ) and allowing the soviets to control the country for 40 years . 
  sure , losing the heavy industry in the north was bad , and it would have had some long-lasting economic consequences even today , but not as long-lasting as the psychological consequences . 
  the `` peace agreements '' at the end of wwi were motivated purely by revenge instead of a desire for lasting peace . 
  i think people looking back at it from some hundred years in the future would consider it a long cease-fire instead of an actual peace . 
  the etyek forest is loved by movie studios ( especially the cheap , locally available and highly trained technical crew ) . 
  most of the architecture that is not ruined is post-renaissance , so unfortunately they would n't be able to shoot too many indoor scenes . 
  the [ castle of eger ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/category:castle_of_eger ) is the first one that pops to mind that could be used for some siege-scenes . 
  but it already has a separate montenegro . 
  i do n't think there was any point in time with a unified germany , an existing czechoslovakia but a separate montenegro . 
  you know what else is natural ? 
  bears . 
  damn ... you know , it 's bad enough when a pigeon shits on your car . 
  but then we can round up some flying pigs and release them over the is . 
  that would be fun . 
  tanks have the right of way everywhere , it 's just not necessarily codified . 
   according to orban they call each other `` dictator '' and `` arch duke '' since years . 
  so they never did . 
  `` healthy at every size '' , yeah ... 
  it 's from 2010 but based on the hungarian parties it 's fairly accurate . 
  as long as you consider right-wing economics as free market and the left-wing as a tightly controlled one , with laissez-faire and planned economy being the extremes . 
  szdsz are free market liberals , so while their social policies are rather leftist , their economic policies are more liberal . 
  mdf are free market conservative . 
  or i should say `` were '' for the last two parties since they became irrelevant in 2010 . 
  mszp ( socialists ) was dragged to a more free-market standpoint kicking and screaming first by the szdsz then by gyurcs\u00e1ny and bajnai . 
  fidesz , kdnp and jobbik are all about nationalizing some industries and tightly controlling others , protectionalism , getting rid of `` evil multinationals '' , etc. . . and lmp , well , they are pretty much the only party currently entertaining the idea of ubi . 
  the party names are frequently relics ( the `` fi '' in fidesz stands for `` fiatal '' - `` young '' , and the `` de '' stands for `` democratic '' ; their representatives have the highest average age and they consider democracy a necessary evil ) . 
  it 's possible that the communists ( you mean labor ? 
  i 'm not too well-versed in uk politics , i just know that both sides are a bunch of wankers ) have shifted to the center enough that the greens overtook them from the left . 
  the chart only maps their economic position ignoring their social policies . 
  the two biggest issues are the government and the opposition . 
  hot , poor girls . 
  that 's it . 
  also explains the ukrainian and russian actresses . 
  it read like something from tumblr . 
   it is mindblowing that a person who lived through soviet occupation and a totalitarian oppressive state is so clueless . 
  he did n't have the slightest problem with the system , his only issue was that he was n't on top of it . 
  it would be harder if the us company would want to offer their services in only one country ( say , uk ) because the licensing fees would be higher . 
  but it would be much easier to offer their products in all of europe . 
  plus i hope that it would put an end to arbitrary shipping restrictions too . 
  ordering from amazon.de while living in the netherlands is a minefield , some items can be shipped , others ca n't . 
  just germany . 
  it 's the physical product of \u00dcber that is problematic , not the app itself . 
  well , they have only one neighbor to hate . 
  meanwhile we have 7 . 
  they were speaking japanese , so i do n't think so ... 
  hungary , very much so . 
  but foreigners usually do n't expect random hungarians to speak their language either . 
  i once gave directions to some japanese people in japanese , their face should have been photographed and uploaded to wikipedia for the article `` surprise ( emotion ) '' . 
  foreigners trying to speak hungarian are another level , i think we treat them better than hungarians . 
  yeah . 
  please , just slow down !, 
  i can understand the announcements at the train station , i can understand tv , i can understand radio and i would probably understand you if you just * slowed the hell down * . 
  the future is here . 
  the system was changed by the government to favor them ( fewer representatives in total , a larger part of them from first-past-the-goalpost individual districts , a smaller parts from the proportional lists ) . 
  yeah , i 'd call it insane if it was n't exactly as planned by them ( they had a 2/3 in the last cycle as well with 51 % of the votes and they knew that they would lose voters ) . 
  our government had a * supermajority * with 44 % . 
  that 's more than 2/3 of the seats . 
  hey , [ it works in kerbal space program . 
  i root for the bull . 
  not necessarily . 
  you can use your vote yourself , like it were a direct democracy . 
  i 'd support something like liquid democracy : you could use your vote yourself or delegate it to someone else . 
  i think it 's na\u00efve to expect the average voter to be informed , but informed voters should n't have to delegate their votes to less informed politicians . 
  well , l\u00e1z\u00e1r says it is , so it 's probably not . 
   `` how about a bird of prey ? 
  or a couple of swords ? 
  perhaps an anchor ? '', 
  i guess it 's supposed to represent the air force , the army and the navy respectively . 
  yeah , we have the infamous `` suicide song '' ... ( and the suicide rates to match ), 
  mustaches are only specifically prevalent on politicians , especially the conservative ones . 
  color me shocked . 
  they are written in ipa ( the phonetic alphabet and not the beer type ) , not in `` how it would sound in the local writing system '' . 
  `` x '' is actually used in hungarian , with the original latin pronunciation . 
  `` qu '' too , in latin words , much like in german ( ex . 
  : aquincum ) but the transliteration to `` kv '' is also acceptable . 
  `` ny '' is used too . 
  `` ly '' is an interesting case ; it * used * to denote a separate sound ( iirc somewhere between ` l' and ` j' ) but in modern hungarian it 's the same sound as `` j '' ( the german version ) . 
  i have an `` ly '' in my name , i tried explaining it several times but it 's a pain in the ass . 
  nowadays when i 'm explaining it in english , i just say `` the ` l' is silent '' . 
  edit : and i forgot ty . 
  no wonder , that 's one of the less frequent sounds in hungarian . 
  like the first sound in `` tuesday '' . 
  [ the highest point marker in question ] ( http://imgur.com/folzcbw ) the restaurant next to it ( bokkerijder ) sells gigantic burgers for really good prices , i can recommend it . 
  especially if you biked up there . 
  then you go and corrupt the temple with your powerful dark side aura . 
  hungarians in the netherlands ... there are dozens of us !, 
  dozens !, 
  ( or thousands , judging from the biggest facebook group . ), 
  yeah , in hungary we usually have those hollow `` chocolate '' eggs . 
  this time i brought home a kilo of filled , actual chocolate eggs from albert heijn . 
  they are delicious . 
  that 's just not fair . 
  another historical fact you would know if you had read the baroque cycle . 
  and the modern computer , the safety match , the dynamo ... 
  i think `` cumstain '' is the most accurate english translation , very similar in both the wording and the intent . 
  now i imagine cesar milan going around in the parliament , pinching politicians on the scruff and hissing at them . 
  actually , not a bad idea . 
  hey , if it worked with cartman ... 
  hey , is that a combino ? 
  `` blocked '',
