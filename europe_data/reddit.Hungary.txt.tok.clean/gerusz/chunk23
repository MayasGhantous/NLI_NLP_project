  lobby vs. people : n +1 : 0 fucking greedy corrupt shitbags , all of them . 
  of fucking course they do n't give a fuck ( or even a dried cumstain on the hotel bedsheet ) about roaming charges when we are paying their phone bills . 
  i hope they 'll have to spend the money they got for this on experimental one-in-million chance cancer treatments . 
  i hate the hungarian government as much as only one of us can , but even i say that this is waaaaaaaay over the top . 
  your new law has a participation threshold too ? 
  that 's quite shitty . 
  at least it 's only 30 % , could be worse . 
  but a participation threshold always leads to the no-show paradox where boycotting becomes a tool the minority can use to sabotage a referendum . 
  another issue here is that basically 15 % +1 of the voters could decide on something , which is far from a majority . 
  what i would support is something of a `` minimum majority requirement '' , that is , the vote would be successful if at least x % of the people ( x = 33 % or so ) votes for the same answer ( it 's of course possible that the votes for both answers reaches that , in which case it 's the majority vote that counts ) . 
  that way no one could hurt their own case by voting for it , which means that boycotting the vote becomes unreasonable . 
  though the large stores might take a while to reopen on sundays . 
  their employees ' schedules are usually set a couple of weeks in advance . 
  the [ winkeltijdenwet ] ( http://wetten.overheid.nl/bwbr0007952/2013-07-01 ) is a lot less strict than the hungarian law was . 
  the hungarian law made exemptions a very special case ( usually tailored for cba , a chain owned by people close to the govt . 
  ) , whereas the winkeltijdenwet is more of a general guideline , and the gemeenten can allow sunday , night , and holiday opening on their discretion ( a3 .1 ) . 
  religious exemption is granted automatically ( a6 .1 ) , whereas no such concept existed in the hungarian law . 
  so writing to your gemeente , or even a local referendum is probably easier than trying to get the govt . 
  to get rid of a2 .1 a , or even a2 .1 in general . 
  we call it `` gumicsont '' - `` rubber bone '' , named for a popular type of chew toy for dogs . 
  while the public is busy chewing it , the government can continue stealing . 
  or both , in case of n-korea . 
  christians have no qualms about quoting the ot to support their stance on something . 
  the nt always conveniently only overrides the parts of the ot that they feel restrictive ( pork , mixed fabric , tattoos , etc. . . ) but never overrides the parts they agree with . 
  not quite . 
  european laws advocated disproportionate punishment for centuries when the church was more influential . 
  the current system is based on utilitarianism if anything : revenge might make the victims / the relatives of the victims happier , but in the long run turning the criminal into a productive member of society is more useful . 
  if you cut off a thief 's hand or throw him into a hellhole of a prison for a decade , society just ends up with someone who will never contribute to anything . 
  if you teach the thief a profession in a humane prison , there is a pretty good chance that he wo n't go back to stealing and will contribute to society more than his stay in prison and his education cost . 
  there 's also the fact that humans are generally risk-avoidant rather than risk-neutral , meaning that improving the chance of getting caught reduces crime rate more than making the punishment harsher . 
  from a risk-neutral perspective a 90 % chance of getting 1 year in prison and a 10 % chance of getting 9 years are equivalent , but more humans would commit crimes in the latter case than in the former . 
  making jail sentences longer costs money , and spending the same amount of money on police is better at achieving the same goals . 
  of course there are some people who are way beyond rehabilitation . 
  but as it turns out , a justice system focusing on rehabilitation first , protecting the society from those beyond rehabilitation second , and punishment as a distant third is much better at reducing crime rate and recidivism rate than a punitive system . 
  `` turning the other cheek '' has nothing to do with it . 
  because there is absolutely zero incentive for them to do an attack in a country with 0.1 % muslim population ? 
  only $ 1.8 million ? 
  what is this , amateur hour ? 
  [ surprisingly difficult . 
  ] ( http://qntm.org/destroy ), 
   but you ca n't kill an ideology not with bullets and bombs , that is . 
  how so ? 
  there is racism , just check this fucking subreddit , or the ethnicity of the average person `` randomly selected '' for security screening . 
  denying that it exists just plays into the hands of the recruiters , but even ineffective ( but well-meaning ) attempts at stopping it can disarm their propaganda . 
  it 's all about perception , racism does n't have to be at apartheid / jim crow levels for the recruiters to latch onto and blow it out of proportion in the eyes of their targets , the only thing necessary is for them to feel that they ca n't turn to the proper authorities to stop it . 
  the governments probably would n't print money like toilet paper because they learned from the past ( hungary post-ww2 , zimbabwe ) and do n't want hyperinflation . 
  if they need money , they want a controlled inflation . 
  in fact , i expect the eu to start inflating the euro by 2-3 % , though not in response to the refugee / migration crisis , but to give countries like greece an effective debt haircut without an actual nominal haircut . 
  if the governments are so desperate for money that they risk hyperinflation , then shit has already hit the fan , and not in the `` economic crisis '' meaning , but in the `` ww3 '' meaning . 
  you do n't actually have the right to be served . 
  it 's simply a verbal contract between you and the business , and the business has the right to refuse you based on anything ( except protected classes ) . 
  this includes method of payment . 
  why ? 
  imo businesses should be given the freedom to accept and decline whatever methods of payment they want as long as whatever they accept can be converted to the local currency ( for tax purposes ) . 
  a business that goes cashless probably calculated that the costs associated with handling cash ( maintaining the cash register , additional security features , the price they pay when they put it on their bank account ( < = imo this one should be 0 by law ... ) and the costs to take the money to the bank ( physically - for a small business it 's some paid hours for an employee or employees , for a large business it 's a g4 van ) ) are bigger than the sales they lose . 
  they should not be forced to offer a payment option that is n't worth it for them simply because some people want to use that method . 
  sure , but the government is n't restricting or killing off cash . 
  the article uses private businesses going cashless as the starting point and draws the consequence that there is an `` unofficial war on cash '' . 
  it also says that using cash is a way of escaping the financial system , which is false ( or only true if cash users are a minority ) . 
  the government would likely just `` print '' money and inflate away your savings , regardless of whether they were in cash or on your bank account ( stocks , foreign bonds , precious metals and foreign currencies would be safe though ) to avoid the public outrage a levy would cause . 
  however , nice fearmongering there with the immigration . 
  and now we arrived to full circle : * you can do that without cash !, 
  * the article is about cash vs. digital currency , not about diversifying your savings portfolio ( which is always a good idea regardless ) . 
   if you have 1000 euros in the bank , the cb can devalue that amount . 
  it 's a reality . 
  and if you have 1000 euros in cash , the cb can devalue that amount . 
  it 's also a reality . 
  inflation does n't work by taking the money from your bank account . 
   regarding the social security - i do n't believe in that system working in 20y from now . 
  i will receive absolutely no money from it . 
  i 'm 100 % certain . 
  same in hungary . 
  we used to have a private retirement fund system , until the new government stole it in 2011 . 
  ( or , more accurately , blackmailed it out of the people - they said that people might keep their private funds , but if they do , they will still have to pay money into social security , yet only be able to receive the private one once they retire . ), 
  the ratk\u00f3-children ( hungarian baby boomers born in the early '50s ) will retire in 2018-2019 . 
  we are fucked . 
  second and third generation immigrants who never had to live in a country run by radical muslims operating on sharia law can easily romanticize such a country . 
  especially if they are in the lower strata of society ; they imagine that as muslim males they would live like kings . 
  daesh-recruiters are of course feeding this vision . 
  they tell them that the racism they experience occasionally is sanctioned by the government and that they are the lucky ones because others experience it constantly , that everything they hear from mainstream news about the middle-east is a carefully manufactured propaganda by the same government designed to keep them down , etc. . . once the recruiters get someone to accept the premise that everything the kafirs are telling them about islam , daesh , the middle-east , etc. . . is a lie , it 's surprisingly easy to make them live in essentially an alternate reality . 
  of course this would n't work if there was n't a fertile ground of second and third generation immigrants with only basic education ( thus lower class ) and some actual racism ( not on the exaggerated and government sanctioned level claimed by the daeshbags , but it 's there ) . 
  did n't anyone look at the plans , model , renders , etc. . . and [ state the obvious ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ttc9ckq.gif ) ?

  considering that it 's a former socialist country , hungary offers several examples , especially in the form of commie blocks . 
  however , the two main contenders are : 1 . 
  [ this monstrosity ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/@47.5056951,19.0464214,3a,75y,163.89h,113.42t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1scktdfgxc2metykp74zpdka!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) , especially considering its location . 
  [ this thing ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/@47.4715119,19.0702628,3a,87.2y,156.38h,108.55t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-nsdi9gbrkiw%2fu2fm1ttp1li%2faaaaaaaahz8%2fi4n-xghbedi!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh5.googleusercontent.com%2f-nsdi9gbrkiw%2fu2fm1ttp1li%2faaaaaaaahz8%2fi4n-xghbedi%2fw203-h101-n-k-no%2f!7i2509!8i1254 ) . 
  especially if you know its history . 
  ( basically : the construction of the national theater was started by the 1994-1998 socialist government in the inner city , the first orb\u00e1n-government from 1998-2002 stopped it , moved it there and built a new one from new plans just because it was originally started by the socialists . ), 
  if they live outside the country , it 's usually hollands ( there are only very minor differences between zuid-hollands and midden-hollands ) . 
  if they live in the country , it depends on the area . 
  i usually do . 
  especially if the title is pitchfork-worthy . 
  i 'm not going to sharpen my ` 3 -- = = -- $ ` double-bladed pitchfork unless i really have to . 
  in scientific circles the [ `` martians '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_martians_ ( scientists \\ ) ) stereotype is still alive and kicking . 
  as a fellow immigrant hungarian in a stem-field , i have done everything to keep it alive , and quite successfully if i may say so . 
  the article is surprisingly sane about it .
