  the harshness of the punishment matters less than its certainty , it gets that right . 
  however , changing sentences from probation to actual time in prison must be coupled with laws against discrimination based on priors for most jobs . 
  being unemployable after even a short sentence leads to high recidivism rates . 
   he was physically blocked by what looks like a group of far-right skinheads inside the building . 
  members of the group were identified as employees of ftc security , the security company responsible for the security of matches of ftc ( sport club , they have teams in several sports , but the most infamous events are their soccer matches ) . 
  the chairman of the club is g\u00e1bor kubatov , who also happens to be the party director of fidesz . 
   double vowels are used to lengthen a vowel when the syllable itself is closed . 
  german usually solves the same problem by sticking an h to the vowel ( example : vaart , like fahrt in german ) . 
  double consonants are to close a syllable , so that the vowel becomes short . 
  that explains some things , especially about verb conjugation in singular present and simple past tenses , also participium perfectum ( or in dutch voltooide deelwoord ) ( betalen =  betaalt , for example ) . 
  the length of the last vowel of the root must be preserved , and since it becomes a closed vowel , you duplicate it , right ? 
  ( unless , of course , it was already a closed vowel in the infinitive , in which case you leave it alone . ), 
  you are * still * programming on paper in prog2 ? 
  shit . 
  i had that class 8 years ago , i hoped that it has changed ( at least a bit ) . 
  do they at least accept c++ 11 , or are they still stuck with c++ 98/c + +03 ? 
  ( i wo n't even ask about c++ 14 ) . 
  also , is failing prog1 or prog2 still a guaranteed 1-year delay ? 
  yeah , it 's kinda hard to build a system against aerial bombing when it predates powered flight ... 
  it could probably give some shelter against artilleries of the age though . 
  if only because it 's in the very center of the city . 
    if we were to become a part of a federalized europe , we 'd have no influence at all , no say in anything . 
   that 's not true at all . 
  a bicameral system that allows for equal representation of each member state ( i.e. 
  not proportional to population ) would give denmark as much say in that organ as germany or france . 
  couple this with pan-european elections for a european parliament , you can be sure that the ep will align itself along ideological party lines , not national ones . 
  hence population of a country will not grant it more influence in a parliament . 
  i do n't see how denmark would become irrelevant in this case . 
  most importantly - and this is something that people from small countries with a centralized government tend to forget - * not everything would be decided on a federal level !, 
  * just take a look at the united states , there are strict limits on the authority of the federal government , and states tend to go to the supreme court if they think the feds have overstepped their authority . 
  and they often win . 
  and these are states that were at most 300 years old when they entered the federation . 
  many european states are * much * older than that , they would demand a much more limited federal government . 
  any realistic federal government in the eu would be limited to economic and monetary policy , military and foreign policy with everything else left in the hands of states ( as long as the rules do n't go against the eu 's establishing principle , that is , `` free movement of goods , services and people '' ) . 
  immunity exists for a reason . 
  mostly to prevent the government-controlled police from arresting the opposition on the day of an important vote that needs the votes of , say , 2/3 of the mps * present * . 
  unfortunately it 's abused , but it 's still better than the alternative . 
  i could only support the abolition of immunity if every law needed the majority or 2/3 ( depending on the law ) of the * total * number of mps instead of those present , eliminating the incentive for the government to prevent opposition mps from voting . 
  the vote is about a two-round system in which only the top two candidates get to the second round . 
  so the voters wo n't be completely ignored ( they still have to vote tactically , potentially for a candidate they hate because they hate the other candidate more ) . 
  in your example , a and b would make it to the second round and the voters of c , d , e , f , and g would have to pick one from them ( and if they all dislike a more than b , it can turn it into a huge win for b ) . 
  i know the drawbacks of fptp , fidesz changed the elections in hungary from a two-round election with compensation to fptp with compensation ( and they changed the compensation as well , to favor them against a fractured opposition ) . 
  that 's how they got a supermajority without even getting an absolute majority of the votes ( in 2010 at least they had the absolute majority ) . 
  so i agree , fptp is the worst possible system . 
  the proposed two-round voting is marginally better , but still an undemocratic pile of shit . 
   this is the system we use for electing the president . 
  why not also the mps ? 
  the point here is also that the proportionate system favours installation of unchangeable puppets and not real mps . 
  there are mps now sitting in the parliament for decades , doing nothing . 
  in one case - our famous ahmed dogan - he did n't even bother to go to the parliament . 
  the new system would be first-past-the-post by districts , right ? 
  ( i assume it 's free for all in the first round , and if no one gets an absolute majority , only the two most popular candidates enter the second round , correct me if i 'm wrong . ), 
  that is the second worst fucking system imaginable , ever ( the first would be one-round fptp ) . 
  it opens up the system to strategic voting , gerrymandering , does n't do anything to prevent the high incumbency rate ( just look at the us ) and potentially ignores up to 49 % of voters . 
  i get the grievances against a simple proportional representation system ( no local elections , less accountability ) but this would make it worse . 
  either one party would be completely dominant despite only having a small absolute majority , or the parties would just gerrymander the whole country into safe districts and you would have essentially the same situation as today but with a much higher barrier of entry for parties whose voters are not geographically concentrated . 
  there are much better systems around ( mmp or stv , particularly the latter ) . 
  belgian beers are good . 
  chocolate , too . 
  yeah , it can get really bad on cloudy nights . 
  but even when the sky happens to be clear ( 10 % of the nights or so ) only the planets and the brightest stars ( like sirius ) can be seen from the city . 
  [ oh , there is better !,

  [ hyppolit 's dialect ] ( https://youtu.be/-kqxov_hvv4?t=432 ) ( he is the butler ) is extremely posh , to the point of exaggeration . 
  maybe the most specific `` poshyness '' is the exaggeration of stress , a very uniform ( and relatively slow ) pace and a bit longer rolling of `` r `` s . the woman 's dialect is also upper class , but it 's a more generic theatrical pronunciation . 
  in comparison , [ in this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktajv0m1tya ) the reporter 's dialect is a typical for someone reading from a teleprompter for the first time or repeating a text rehearsed only a couple of times , only caring about the correctness of the text and not the intonation . 
  the interviewees are examples of the typical budapest accents and dialects . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tda9n7qckac ) are more examples of the accent young ( and slightly drunk ) people use . 
  corn flakes wall between the us and mexico at the end , oh my sides . 
  well , `` h\u00fashagy\u00f3 kedd '' is generally a huge feast , with lots of leftovers ... 
  unless the language is historically phonemic . 
  ( old hungarian runes started out as a phonemic writing system . 
  there were various attempts at transcribing the language to latin letters until the 18th century which were more-or-less phonemic , and the spelling standardized in the 18th-19th century is almost completely phonemic . 
  except for when straying away from the phonemic writing makes it easier to interpret the word , like on word borders of compound words , and some borders of suffixes . ), 
  tbh i just looked it up in google translate and used a variant that is more french-sounding than simply `` le pop-corn '' . 
  ooooh , someone fucks with the french language . 
  better grab le ma\u00efs souffl\u00e9 !, 
  in hungary it 's called `` gluttonous thursday '' , but it 's only next week . 
  the reason for it ( and the interruption of lent for one day ) is to make sure that no leftover meat from `` h\u00fashagy\u00f3 kedd '' ( tuesday before lent ) goes to waste . 
  yeah , we can be frugal like that . 
  since 2006 there is an ongoing initiative for restaurants to offer discount meals ( 50 % off ) on that day . 
  it 's a `` good thing '' then that no one 's consent is required for storing the byproducts of energy production in the fucking atmosphere ... 
  it somehow manages to have a rating that is 0.1 lower than `` kis vuk '' . 
  something i did n't think possible before . 
  erasmus is available in some non-eu countries ( iceland , liechtenstein , norway , switzerland and turkey ) . 
  if the uk quits the eu , pre-existing grants will probably be respected and they can join the program independent of the rest of the eu . 
  that is probably one of the employability-boosting skills : capable of simulating human behavior even with an ungodly hangover . 
  there are three things to deal with : short term , medium term , long term . 
  ** short term ( 1-2 years ) : ** dealing with those who are already here , en-route , or will come this spring and summer . 
  who are a mixed bag of refugees from war-torn areas and overcrowded refugee camps and other people pretending to be one of them . 
  even the latter ones might end up staying in europe for years because it takes time to judge their claims and the system is overloaded . 
  the eu should hire everyone from western countries who speaks arabic well enough to judge someone 's country of origin based on dialect and accent to increase the capacity . 
  there 's also the problem with deportation , namely , that their country of origin does n't cooperate . 
  everyone has their price , and properly supervised and directed distribution of eu funds in those countries for improving their educational system and industry would tie in nicely into the long-term solution . 
  ** medium term ( 1.5-5 years ) : ** dealing with the immediate causes of the current waves of migrants : the civil war in syria and iraq , the civil-war-in-everything-but-name conditions in afghanistan , the failed state of libya and the conditions in the refugee camps . 
  the eu needs a common army that can be used offensively if necessary . 
  turkey also needs to be bribed to allow european companies to build up proper refugee towns on the border ( which will be usable by the locals after the wars are over ) , and peacekeepers to be stationed in said towns . 
  building up these towns would also inject some money into these european companies , which might be a nice little keynesian boost before the next big recession ( place your bets , i think it will come from china ) . 
  with the current level of russian intervention the syrian situation might stabilize in the near future , though suboptimally , as they support assad . 
  ** long term ( 5-x years ) : ** stabilizing and developing north-africa and the middle-east .
