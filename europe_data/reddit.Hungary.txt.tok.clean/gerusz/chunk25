  maybe with proper education it can be done within a generation , and if saudi arabia implodes because of the low oil prices , the fucking wahhabists would lose their funding and stop being an impediment . 
  how many times did we win it ? 
  plenty , if i remember correctly . 
  go yellow !, 
  and by following the `` logic '' in your original post , not keeping nations separate means shitty life for everyone . 
  poor dutch people , i 'm actively making their country worse by working here legally ... 
   but there 's no such restriction when it comes to declaring rendk\u00edv\u00fcli \u00e1llapot , sz\u00fcks\u00e9g\u00e1llapot or vesz\u00e9lyhelyzet . 
  those can be enacted only for distinct sets of circumstances that are also defined in the constitution . 
  the reason why the new modification is dangerous is that it can be declared in case of a `` terror threat '' , and * the government can simply decide that there is a terror threat * . 
  so not wanting to give basically infinite authority to the government ( to a government which abuses even the power it currently has ) is being retarded . 
  we should just get rid of checks and balances and enact tyranny of the ( relative , mind you - the current government had a supermajority with 44 % of the votes ) majority . 
  it has worked out so well in the past , right ? 
  by the way nations in their current form are a fairly recent invention , from the 19th century . 
  most countries - including monarchies - were multinational up until that point . 
  also , even though you seem to be in love with the slippery slope fallacy , your slippery slope is rather like a slippery rollercoaster . 
  you do n't need a nation to have order . 
  you need fair and stable laws , and a police ( and similar authorities ) that can enforce them . 
  hell , even states that are not nation states can go overboard with order , just look at the soviet union . 
  but let me show you two current examples . 
  exhibit 1 : usa . 
  draconian drug laws ( until recently , and even that is only starting to change in the blue states ) , yet drug use is higher than in the fucking netherlands because the police ca n't enforce those laws consistently , and 99 % of the lawbreakings go unpunished . 
  and you ca n't find a more patriotic population than them , they are essentially brainwashed from elementary school , yet they have the highest incarceration rate in the world and a huge crime rate . 
  exhibit 2 : germany . 
  they got the patriotism beaten out of them so hard that even i say it 's a bit much , let the poor krauts love their country ffs . 
  anyway , both their incarceration rate and crime rate is significantly lower than that of the us , and while it 's probably going to increase in the near future , they have a long way to go to hit us , or even hungarian levels . 
  oh , and there is the fact that too much order will start to infringe on personal freedoms . 
  it 's all fun and games as long as it does n't take away your personal freedoms , but sooner or later it will be your turn to be the hated deviant . 
  maybe you like your occasional bowl of weed , maybe you simply smoke , maybe you like junk food , maybe once in a while you like partying until 4am , maybe you listen to punk , maybe you 're not christian , maybe you like using google , i do n't know . 
  but i like doing whatever the fuck i want as long as i 'm not hurting anyone else , thankyouverymuch . 
  edit : [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/iynsaeu ) was the comment that i replied to . 
  obviously i ca n't prove that i did n't edit the comment via developer view before taking the screenshot , so you need to take my word for it . 
  or not . 
  your choice . 
  anyway , i probably could n't produce such an edgy teenage fascist rambling even if i tried . 
  ^ ^ \\ ( at ^ ^ least ^ ^ my ^ ^ slippery ^ ^ slopes ^ ^ would ^ ^ follow ^ ^ some ^ ^ semblance ^ ^ of ^ ^ a ^ ^ logical ^ ^ order . ), 
  not since they lost a district in a midterm . 
  what * you * fail to understand is that currently they need 2/3 of the votes to enact a state of emergency . 
  with this modification , they wo n't need it , they will have the authority to declare it whenever the fuck they please for 60 days . 
  and it might be true that extending it after the 60 days requires a 2/3 , but since there is no `` cooldown period '' , they can enact it again immediately once it expires . 
  sure , the constitutional court might rule it to be against the spirit of the constit ... ooops , they neutered the constitutional court already , it ca n't reject laws on that basis and even if it could , it 's staffed with their own people . 
  does that make it a good thing ? 
  also , these rights in those countries are far more limited , they give more authority to the police but they ca n't order complete curfews , block phone networks , the internet , or the highways , and they ca n't modify the budget at-will . 
  what the fuck would be patriotic in supporting a modification of the constitution that essentially allows the government to declare a state of emergency at will and override laws ? 
  [ meanwhile on fidesz 's facebook page ] ( http://imgur.com/kevrdcr ) translation : -- the left-wing parties do n't support : * the tightening of immigration rules * dispatching policemen and soldiers to the borders * the construction of the fence now they do n't support the modification of the constitution , they do n't want to protect the country from terrorists !, 
  for us , the safety of hungarian people is the first !, 
  -- 1950s reloaded . 
  the closest translations would be `` alf\u00f6ld '' , but we 're already using it as a common noun for plains . 
  or `` m\u00e9lyf\u00f6ld '' , but it 's also a common noun ( for any land below sea level ) . 
   because women usually enter for free remember : if you 're not paying for a service , you 're the product . 
  exactly . 
  maybe if different clubs actually played somewhat different music ... for example , i 'm convinced that the 4-5 clubs in the center of maastricht where everyone goes just share a spotify playlist . 
  you can do a club-crawl and hear the same song in every single one of them . 
  budapest already is ( the famous `` ruin pubs '' are actually more like night clubs ) . 
  as a hungarian , this is very , very familiar . 
  that 's a start . 
  i assume / hope this ( and more ) is in exchange for providing a safe country where people fished out of the mediterranean can be put for processing . 
   i also do n't understand why the european union seems to be not capable of thinking about a solution where all european countries are involved . 
  it 's mostly because a ) the countries that are neither border , nor destination countries do n't want to make it their problem and b ) politicians , both from the left and the right are rather content with using the crisis for their own political goals . 
  ideological talk is free , solutions are expensive , and even recommending any expensive actual solution would be unpopular . 
  but that is not an answer to the question `` what ** could ** women do to prevent crimes like this ? '', 
  in a week it will be tens of thousands . 
  do n't worry , this is / r/europe . 
  in a week it will be 100k of them . 
  the way nuclear physics works , if it decays over millions of years , it 's not dangerous ( = it emits a low level of radiation ) . 
  the truly dangerous ones that emit a lot of radiation have short half-lives . 
  it essentially said that the capitalists can only become richer by exploiting the workers more . 
  essentially made society out to be a zero-sum-game of capitalists vs. workers , any gain made by the capitalists is a loss for workers , and the only way workers can gain anything is by taking down the capitalists . 
  turkish people were in a different situation though . 
  they were n't refugees , for one . 
  a more recent example would be the balkan wars ; most refugees were returned to their country of origin once the wars were over . 
   so , should we help those migrants which came from war-torn countries ? 
  i think we should , to the degree that wo n't significantly decrease the standard of living , unless decided differently by a popular vote ( some nations may be willing to sacrifice more of their capacities to shelter refugees ) , but some minimal humanitarianism should be mandatory . 
  helping them now would increase stability in the region in the long run . 
  after all , having hundreds of thousands of refugees who have experienced life in the west , maybe saved up a couple of thousand euros working here , had their children educated in western schools for a while , etc. . . return to syria would be much better than having them return from a turkish refugee camp uneducated , with only their clothes on their back , and having only erdogan to be grateful to . 
  it can be a country that can do the manufacturing currently done in china , maybe cheaper ( lower shipping costs ) , plus a market for european goods and services , and there will be some money to be made in the reconstruction too . 
  the refugee crisis is only a crisis because instead of solving it , politicians have used it to further their own internal ambitions . 
  both orb\u00e1n & co. and merkel & co. are guilty of this . 
  by your logic , the eu should cut off structural funds to e-europe ( because the western countries could easily spend that on themselves , improving the life of their citizens ) and ban e-european workers . 
  and since you started it : fuck you if you think that society is a zero-sum game , that 's the kind of fucked up thinking that led to fascism and communism in the first place . 
  fuck you for not being able to think of a way to improve their lives without worsening our own , and fuck you for stereotyping a whole nation as terrorists . 
   they 're not going to be able to live a good life . 
  that 's a big part of the issue . 
  they 'll form ghettos and live as second class citizens doing unregistered work , living off welfare or turning to crime . 
  which is still a better life than being stuck in a refugee camp without access to jobs ( even unregistered ones ) , education , healthcare or even safety . 
  and definitely better than going back to syria and getting killed by the army , a bombing by some superpower or isis . 
  they are likely using steganography and/or otps , both of them are trivially simple ( so even if they force makers of commercially available software to integrate some backdoors , any terrorist with minimal programming experience can whip up a small program that does n't have said backdoors ) . 
  this is again just an attempt to erode privacy disguised as a matter of national security .

  hahahahaha !, 
  hungary used to have a lot of snow in the '90s , transportation ground to a halt every time . 
  just remember march 15 2013 , the anniversary of the hungarian revolution against austrian rule when austrian snowplows had to help out as the government response only consisted of one unhelpful text message , despite the snowfall having been predicted days earlier .
