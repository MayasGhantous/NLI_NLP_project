  in germany that is already the case . 
  asylum is not citizenship . 
  if one of the biggest polluters ignores it , the whole thing is screwed . 
  it 's a global prisoners ' dilemma , any country defecting will have short-term economic gains , inviting the others to defect as well . 
  the more countries defect , the more the cooperating ones lose , hence the more they will be tempted to defect as well . 
  a president we would love to stand behind !, 
  closely . 
  and push for `` clean coal '' . 
  without an agreement about at least slowing down climate change , it will be a hollow victory . 
  the chances of such agreement now are practically nil with a climate change denier at the head of one of the planet 's greatest polluter . 
  i hope that the roach-people will do better . 
   and guess what effects will migration like happened last year times 50 have on european society ? 
  yup , the syrian refugee crisis was just the rehearsal dinner . 
  civilization is fucked in the next century . 
  [ maybe this ? 
  in this case , the dutch will vote next . 
  jesus , i fucking hope wilders wo n't get another 30 % somehow . 
  see also : syria . 
  it 's neogothic , it was all the rage in the 1860s ( see also : hungarian parliament ) . 
  you could buy it and pay for its maintenance . 
  as i said in the previous thread about it a week ago , not every old building has historical and/or architectural significance . 
  in hungary as well . 
  hell , the guy who dubbed bud ended up making similar movies at bud 's own suggestion . 
  for comparison : [ istv\u00e1n bujtor ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/hu/a/a6/bodrogi_zenthe_bujtor.jpg ) ( on the right ) [ bud spencer ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/altrimenti_ci_arrabbiamo.png ), 
  same . 
  these days if a character 's mouth is n't in sync with their speech , it ruins the immersion instantly . 
  also , it ranks hungary in the same proficiency group as germany . 
  maybe the hungarians who do speak english speak it well , but that 's like 15 % of the population . 
  it was bought out of the museum as a temporary public exhibit , and apparently it had some fuel in it . 
  but when * they * open franchises all around the world , it 's ok ? 
   they thinks god is some old bored dude who is just playing with people by giving them mind and hoping they wo n't use it ? 
  that 's * exactly * what they believe . 
  that the fossils and all the evidence suggesting that the world was n't put together in a week 10k years ago are just a test of faith , and he wants us to believe what the bible claims and not what the evidence suggests . 
  how in the bloody fuck 's name is this relevant to this discussion ? 
  if your god sends unbaptized babies to hell , then maybe he is n't worthy of worship . 
  just saying . 
  would n't it be easier to just post a picture of europe from space at night ? 
  [ it looks basically the same . 
  and then there is budapest . 
  eh , it 's not that bad . 
  i 've met people from the uk who were harder to understand than a dutchie who kept mixing in dutch words because she barely spoke english . 
  unless you have to buy something from a store that does n't accept it . 
  like a bunch of airlines , or google play ( at least how it was a few years ago ) , or amazon ( for stuff that is n't on bol , or is much more expensive there ) . 
  even the api is pretty straightforward . 
  we have a fairly graphic saying for this : `` beating the nettle bush with someone else 's dick '' . 
  i do n't know how it is in other places , but logic is generally taught as a part of mathematics here . 
  at least parts of it . 
  boolean logic , proof by induction , deduction , etc. . . 
  unfortunately it 's practically impossible to determine for older bands , simply because mahasz records from the '80s or before are lost and in the '90s they were n't even kept . 
  according to [ this blog post ] ( http://recorder.blog.hu/2014/04/11/soha_nem_lesz_ilyen_lista_bestseller_magyar_albumok ) the best selling albums from 2003 to 2014 are : 1 . 
  nox : b\u0171v\u00f6let ( universal music ) 3 . 
  rom\u00e9o & juliette ( musical ) ( universal music ) 7 . 
  r\u00dazsa magdi : \u00d6rd\u00f6gi angyal ( cls music ) ( and reading through the yearly cumulative lists [ here ] ( http://zene.slagerlistak.hu/archivum/eves-osszesitett-listak/album_db/2015 ) , this listing is pretty realistic . ), 
  now r\u00fazsa magdolna has the top , but her second one is only at the 10th place , whereas nox has the 2nd and the 4th . 
  so my gut would say that nox has the honor of being the most successful hungarian band since the beginning of accurate recordkeeping . 
  but frankly , if we 're considering the `` all time '' sales , it 's very likely to be lgt , omega , edda , or maybe even republic . 
  most definitely not aurora though . 
  i mean , they are a punk band , and not even the best known one . 
  edit : [ omega claims to have sold 7 million records and thus lead the listing ] ( http://kulturzsiraf.blogspot.nl/2014/03/a-legsikeresebb-albumok-vilagban-es.html ) , but without accurate measurement , it 's just an estimate . 
  facebook is an american company . 
  they censor whatever the fuck they want . 
  feel free to use hyves , vkontakte or diaspora . 
  then why is russia funding jobbik in hungary ( a bona fide fascist party ) , or fn in france ? 
  [ k\u00e1lvin t\u00e9r , now ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/@47.4897964,19.0616034,3a,75y,26.36h,85.64t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s_unc7fjlgu_hhae2bht24a!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) do n't worry , the museum in the background is still there . 
  but the trees have grown a bit . 
  you seem to be stuck in the '80s . 
  russia is n't in the communism-spreading business anymore . 
  in fact , they are funding a number of far-right and/or euroskeptic parties all across europe to weaken the eu . 
  i guess you 're curious about names that are originally hungarian ( in my case ) and were n't invented after hungary became christian ( that is , the year 1000 . ), 
  because technically most latin names would be `` pagan '' . 
  some of such names are fairly popular in hungary . 
  male : csaba , \u00c1rp\u00e1d , \u00c1kos , attila ... g\u00e9za and jen\u0151 were also fairly popular in the previous generation . 
  ah , political cartoons . 
  subtle as ever . 
  at least the burkini one was clever . 
  accidental rhyme in my comments ? 
  never ... 
  and whoever made this chart should 've searched for `` what does hungary 's flag look like ? '', 
  sure , you can always just climb onto the szabads\u00e1g-bridge and jump ( if you do n't mind everyone hating you for making the police and/or the firefighters block the bridge ... but then again , you 'll be dead , what do you care ? ) . 
  or slit your wrist , or overdose on painkillers ( though those are mostly the methods women use ) . 
  or jump in front of a train , with the same caveats as climbing onto the bridge . 
  that 's why i live in the netherlands . 
  hanging yourself is n't the only way to escape hungary ... 
  well , the poor bastards have to live in belgium . 
   j\u00e4\u00e4 : ice in hungarian it 's `` j\u00e9g '' . 
  we do n't have this many snow-related words though . 
  corruption-related , on the other hand ... 
  and clearly # 1 when we look at it per capita . 
  unless , i dunno , there 's some island state in the pacific ocean with a population of 10 and one of them is a porn star . 
  you misspelled hilarious . 
  then again , my sense of humor might be a bit dark . 
   `` preventive incarceration of radical muslims . '', 
  again , who defines `` radical '' ? 
  i have a much bigger issue with the fact that he is advocating `` preventive incarceration '' . 
  yep . 
  [ wikipedia has gdp and gpd/capita on a regional basis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_regions_by_gdp ) . 
  hungary without the central hungary region ( basically budapest and pest county ) would lose half of its gdp , and 80 % of the region 's population lives in the capital or its agglomeration . 
  so even if the gdp/capita were constant in the region ( it is n't ) , removing budapest would cost ~ 40 % of hungary 's but only 20 % of the population , meaning that the gdp/capita would shrink by 25 % or so . 
  right , then i misunderstood you . 
  sorry , it happens .
