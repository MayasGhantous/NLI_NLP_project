   i meant which party - if any - do you support during the election . 
  or whether you abstain from voting altogether . 
  i voted for the left , mostly because i wanted to prevent fidesz from getting another 2/3 and i could n't get myself to vote on the far-right . 
  despite this i at least disagree with most of the parties that constituted that alliance . 
  it 's just that i despise fidesz more . 
   if you describe yourself as a `` libertarian-leaning '' person then your statements about the recent constitutional reform are a bit confusing . 
  there are plenty of things for which to criticize both fidesz and orban personally but you seem to throw accusations all over the place . 
  i do n't say the previous constitution was perfect - it was far from it . 
  but any libertarian would only want a core constitution - a constitution that only defines the basic framework necessary for the state to function . 
  and in this regard i agree with them . 
  instead we got some bullshit that just replaces the remaining socialist morality with conservative morality and which had to be amended before the ink dried on the first ceremonial prints . 
   also `` libertarian '' typically - in present day - means that you oppose socialist solutions for the economy . 
  unless you mean `` socialist '' as in `` introduced by the socialists '' which as i recall might be counter-intuitive because the right in hungary seems to be more protectionist than the left . 
  i 'm * closest * to a libertarian * if i had to place myself in the context of current political parties * . 
  ( not like hungary had a libertarian party , but whatever . ), 
  unlike libertarians , however , i believe that the state can be a force for good and that some social net is beneficial . 
  but i refuse to define myself in the context of political parties in general and in the context of hungarian political parties in particular , simply because probably there is no party i agree with 100 % . 
   besides some people complain about two-party systems but in reality as long as there 's no formal , legal barrier to minor parties there 's nothing wrong with a two-party system . 
  it 's really not like five parties give you all the options really ... perhaps a 50-party system but not this . 
  i have issues with * representative * democracy for this reason ( not with democracy itself ! ) . 
  it was ok when the fastest way to communicate was the homing pigeon . 
  but these days any citizen can access the information to make an informed decision in matters and communicate this decision instantly . 
  being forced to delegate that vote to someone i do n't agree with seems absurd . 
  i was born in hungary , but i do n't remember anything from the socialist regime , i 'm not that old . 
  however , there are definite similarities in his rhetorics and the rhetorics of il duce and the f\u00fchrer . 
  but yeah , maybe authoritarian is a better word than totalitarian , though the distinction is n't exactly sharp . 
   the `` problem '' is that in both elections fidesz got 50 % of votes . 
  that is not true , they got less than that in the 2014 elections . 
  there is a definite , qualitative difference between getting the majority of the votes ( 50 % + ) and simply getting more votes than the second most popular party . 
  really , there are three kinds of majorities , especially in hungary : one , the relative majority . 
  when the party gets more votes than the second most popular . 
  second , the absolute majority . 
  this is when a party gets 50 % + . 
  so far these ones were simply statistical terms . 
  then there is the one that is specific to hungary ( and i think a whole lot of other countries ) , the 2/3 called `` qualified majority '' which is sufficient to change the constitution and other fundamental laws . 
  it is not unheard of for a party with relative majority to get absolute majority , in fact the previous system was set up to make it easier in order to make the country actually governable . 
  it is also likely that a party with absolute majority will get qualified majority . 
  this is more of an unintended consequence . 
  it happened 20 years ago when the socialists and the liberals got 72 % of the seats . 
  i believe the lawmakers of 1989 considered this possibility and decided that in this case the politicians will exercise some restraint and wo n't change the constitution unilaterally . 
  they just did n't expect that a totalitarian dick like orb\u00e1n will once get the 2/3 . 
  i wrote it in another comment somewhere here , or you can just look up the wikipedia ( it 's fairly complicated ) : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elections_in_hungary#changes_in_the_electoral_system_from_2012_onwards, 
   so 2/3 is the threshold to change the constitution in hungary ? 
  yes . 
   edit : also since we 're all anonymous here , care to state your political preference ? 
  since you 're flair is hungarian it 's kind of important in such discussion . 
  i would say i 'm closest to a libertarian , but that would n't be 100 % correct . 
  socially i 'm most definitely liberal and i believe that the government should n't push their morals on the people . 
  economically i see huge flaws in both conservative and socialist models so i prefer to decide on a case-by-case basis instead of just defaulting to one of the parties . 
   how did that come about ? 
  [ see my other comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ephab/fixing_europes_orb%c3%a1n_problem/ck1rfj4 )  were the changes introduced back then ? 
  yes , after getting 2/3 in 2010 they wrote the new election rules . 
  with a system rigged to favor the biggest voting block , compounded with the stupidest opposition the country has ever seen ( and considering the usual crop , that 's saying a lot ) . 
  hungarian system is mixed , part of the seats comes from proportional party lists and the other part comes from individual districts with compensation . 
  the first thing they did was shifting the weight towards individual districts : in 2010 there were 210 seats from regional and national lists ( the proportional component ) and 176 seats from individual constituencies . 
  currently , however , there are only 93 seats from lists and 106 seats from constituencies . 
  second , they changed the process of voting in the constituencies . 
  in 2010 if the winner of the first round of voting did n't win with an absolute majority ( 50 % + ) , and / or the turnout was below 50 % then a second round was held two weeks afterwards , with the top 3 candidates from the first round and any other candidate with more than 15 % of the votes . 
  between the two rounds candidates could resign , this was usually the strategy of the socialists and the liberals ( both candidates were in the running in the first round and the candidate with the fewer votes resigned before the second round ) . 
  starting from 2014 it 's one-round first-past-the goalpost . 
  so in case of a 34 % -33 % -33 % vote the one with 34 % will get the seat , despite the vast majority voting for someone else . 
  plus there are 70 fewer constituencies . 
  there was massive gerrymandering , obviously . 
  and third , they changed the compensation . 
  up until 2010 only the votes for the losing candidates were added to the compensation lists . 
  from 2014 the votes for the losing candidates and the difference between the winner and the second place are added to the party list votes . 
  if this system is n't changed , it will result in a two-party system soon enough , but right now the opposition was also split between the far-right jobbik ( part of the voters are actually far-right , but many of them only voted for them because they are the only ones who have n't been in power yet , ergo they are the only ones who have n't fucked up governing the country yet ) and the dumbfuck left-wing alliance who , instead of actually campaigning were still busy with deciding which one of them gets to nominate a candidate in which district weeks before the elections ( voters usually voted for them because even though they did fuck up governing betweem 2002 and 2010 , they at least had the decency to try to cover up their thievery and were n't totalitarian ) . 
  getting an absolute ( 50 % + ) majority of the seats with a relative majority of the votes or getting a supermajority ( 2/3 ) with an absolute majority is n't unheard of , in fact most voting systems of the world would end up like that and the 2014 votes would have resulted in an absolute but not 2/3 majority in the 2010 system . 
  a mandate of 44 % of the votes ( 27 % of the total number of voters ) , giving him a supermajority ( 2/3 ) in the parliament , allowing him to rewrite the constitution without the agreement of anyone else . 
  at least the last time ( 2010 ) he had more than 50 % of the votes . 
  and while i do n't believe he is going to build concentration camps or attack other countries , you should know that hitler was elected as well . 
  ** i just want to say with this that ** getting popular mandate does n't mean that there ca n't be problems and `` well , they elected him '' does n't absolve him from criticism , especially if he is acting like a totalitarian dick . 
  i 'm all for getting him the kennedy package . 
  and many have done it already . 
  we do n't really have independence days . 
  we do , however , have three national holidays . 
  the `` birthday of the country '' was on 20th of august . 
  it 's celebrated with fireworks . 
  then there is the celebration of the revolution of 1848 on the 15th of march which led to an independence war lasting for ~ 1.5 years . 
  while the war failed , the political changes were still implemented and paved the road for the `` kiegyez\u00e9s '' ( `` ausgleich '' ) and the dualist kingdom . 
  we celebrate it with the politicians making speeches in which they try to compare themselves to the revolutionaries and the government ( in case of opposition politicians ) or the < insert less friendly nearby power here , currently the eu  ( in case of the government ) to the habsburgs . 
  and there is the celebration of the revolution of 1956 , combined with the declaration of the current / former republic in 1989 on the 23rd of october . 
  we celebrate it with the politicians making speeches in which they try to compare themselves to the revolutionaries and the government ( in case of opposition politicians ) or the < insert less friendly nearby power here , currently the eu  ( in case of government ) to the ussr . 
  yeah , especially because if you look up * any * swedish city on wikipedia ( i did it with stockholm just to test my theory ) you get linked to [ this ] ( http://www.webcitation.org/6cyepq9rp ) xls . 
  and quick fashion . 
  mostly quick fashion . 
  should 've used more boosters . 
  the real issue is that this growth was driven by government projects . 
  once the money for those runs out , the growth will stop again . 
  also , honest question : how is literacy measured ? 
  literacy in native language or literacy in ( one of ) the official language ( s ) of the country in residence ? 
  if only he shot himself . 
  in the head . 
  with something high-caliber . 
  and maybe an explosive bullet . 
  the kind that turns his head into chunky salsa . 
  until the ufp comes around , i 'm really fine with the current flag . 
  you do n't fuck with a widely recognized symbol . 
  which would n't be bad ... we should build the spaceship to match first though . 
  ** budapest : ** mostly crappy vehicles but very dense network .
