  trick-or-treating will never spread in europe . 
  it requires the acceptance of the whole society - if there are no trick-or-treaters walking around , people wo n't prepare with candy and if people wo n't prepare with candy , trick-or-treaters wo n't be walking around . 
  so the only part of halloween that is spreading is the dress-up-and-get-drunk part . 
  which is fun . 
  ( i just hope that we 'll invent a dress-up festival somewhere in the summer ( st. ivan 's night ? ) . 
  it 's too cold in most of europe for girls to dress up in slutty costumes during both halloween and the carnival season . ), 
  of course the church hates fun , this is nothing new . 
  dunno , another excuse to dress up and get drunk is always welcome . 
  they will end up in oceania anyway . 
  sorry , but it does n't work this way . 
  just look at nuclear fusion , it was discovered in 1932 and we still do n't have fusion plants up and running . 
  do n't bet on it , have you tasted p\u00e1linka ? 
  because the un is completely ineffective . 
  un member states wage wars against each other all the time and the un has no power to stop it . 
  afghanistan was a member since 1946 , iraq since 1945 . 
  iran is also a member , so is israel and egypt . 
  yeah , the permanent members of the security council have n't waged a war against each other , but that 's hardly an achievement of un and more of an effect of mad , nato and eu among other things . 
  well , they probably had nobody who deserved the award . 
  i think they saved the `` peace nobel for eu '' award for an year like this . 
  an electric kettle . 
  makes pasta , cooks hot-dogs and of course heats water for tea / ramen / instant coffee . 
  working illegally so they would get the whole 140.000 instead , moving in with their parents , working multiple jobs , etc. . . 
  let 's play the misery poker ? 
  sure . 
  b\u00e9la in hungary earns 1.5 times the hungarian minimal wage for a call center job . 
  it 's 70.000 huf after taxes which is roughly 245 $ . 
  for b\u00e9la 's employer , it costs around 145.000 huf though . 
  also , vat in hungary is 27 % , meaning that for every 100 huf b\u00e9la has worked for , 62 huf goes to the state . 
  the cheapest home b\u00e9la could find is a 10m ^ 2 hole , costing him 30.000 huf . 
  he still has to pay his part of the utilities , costing him another 15.000 huf . 
  b\u00e9la has to get to the job and hungarian companies usually do n't have bike racks and showers so he has to use the public transportation , another 10.000 huf per month . 
  now b\u00e9la has a `` home '' and can get to work and back . 
  he has 15.000 huf left , which is 52 $ . 
  for food , clothing , entertainment and medicine . 
  if b\u00e9la eats one hot meal per day ( made of the cheapest ingredients he can get ) , he might not starve to death . 
  i 'm not b\u00e9la , this is also a theoretical example . 
  however , many hungarians live from the hungarian minimal wage which is 47.000 huf . 
  hungarian high schools : * sports : nope . 
  most schools do n't have proper sporting facilities , the best they have are handball courts and maybe a relatively small sports hall . 
  no high school sports life whatsoever , no team mascots , team jackets , no cheerleaders ( there are some cheerleader groups but they are n't associated with high schools ) , etc. . . * this , of course , does n't prevent the existence of jocks , only makes them harder to spot . 
  individual sport achievements are rewarded both on high school and college level . 
  * prom : nope . 
  we have a senior dance . 
  this varies by school , but usually the senior classes individually present some show dance . 
  then the seniors receive their ribbons ( usually consists of an actual ribbon emblazoned with the years of their enrollment and their graduation and a badge with the school 's coat of arms / a portrait of the school 's namesake ) , dance a waltzer ( or sometimes a palot\u00e1s , a type of hungarian dance though waltzer is far more popular ) , dance some with friends , families , etc. . . then they have afterparties in clubs . 
  sometimes there are shows during the breaks by student dancers , gymnasts or student bands . 
  * oh , yeah , classes . 
  every year is divided into classes a , b , c , d , e , f. . . 
  the letters rarely ever denote anything . 
  usually there are at most 5 classes per year ( so a to e ) . 
  sometimes there are class `` ny '' ( nyelv is language in hungarian ) , `` r '' ( rajz , drawing ) and `` z '' ( zene , music ) but only rarely in special , art or language-oriented schools . 
  students do n't have individual timetables , classes do . 
  * no officially sanctioned popularity contests in classes , usually . 
  this might vary by school , of course . 
  so i 'd say hungarian schools are not american at all . 
  i also want 400,000 $ to churn out idiotic recommendations like this !, 
  where can i apply ? 
  maltese has yellows in the vertical as well which is worse than red . 
  but they do fare better in their row ... 
  it would be strange if greenwich was n't on gmt though ... 
  maltese ... finally a language that has worse machine translation than hungarian . 
  ladies ... 
  johnson ... somewhat strange . 
  or not , i 'm socially liberal and fiscally centrist . 
  jill stein was a close second . 
  strange thing is , i seem to agree more with the dp than with the greens or the libertarians ... http://www.isidewith.com/results/97501533 hey , at least it 's not romney . 
  if a gypsy was killed every time someone posts something like this on the internet , we would n't have gypsies . 
  or the governments and the people might just stop listening to them because they obviously have no fucking clue about this , only hear `` nuclear '' and think that any nuclear plant could go chernobyl the moment a butterfly lands on top of one of the coolant towers . 
  because it 's * nuclear * fusion . 
  nuclear is bad , mkay ? 
  [ source ] ( http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/press/releases/iterprojectfrance/ ), 
  and this is why i fucking hate `` greens '' . 
  they have a knee-jerk reaction against everything nuclear and would prefer to burn coal ... despite the facts showing that a ) coal plants are responsible for a lot more deaths per mw than nuclear plants and b ) coal plants actually emit more radiation than nuclear plants . 
  fucking idiots are even against fusion research . 
  ( edit : [ source ] ( http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/press/releases/iterprojectfrance/ ) ), 
  depends on the method of calculation , but yeah , quite probably in poland . 
  in this case , put it to the geometric center of europe ( counting turkey but not counting russia and switzerland ) hoping that every country will eventually join . 
  it will be probably somewhere in poland , czech , slovakia or hungary . 
  just sign the treaty founding the united states of europe at the at-the-time center of the eu and build the city commemorating the treaty . 
  problem solved . 
  biggest winners ? 
  the banks who will handle the currency exchange . 
  either brussels or a new city ( europe city ) built in the geometric center of the eu . 
  the real reason is much more sinister than that : our politicians figured out that stealing money by overpriced constructions is n't just easier - it 's practically * legal * ( even if they can prove that a politician gave the commissions to someone other than the best bidder , it 's only a minor offence ( infidel handling of state property ) and not a crime ) . 
  those highways cost 3-4 times more than highways in germany or croatia . 
  and right now we 're building football stadiums for the nonexistent hungarian football and strangely every single one is being built by k\u00f6zg\u00e9p , company of simicska who financed the political campaign of fidesz . 
  also , for some strange reason the billboards of the advertising company owned by simicska are currently full of meaningless government propaganda . 
  it 's completely legal . 
  also , check out budapest metro line 4 . 
  it takes longer to build than the ** fucking lhc ** ( lhc : 10 years , duke nukem forever : 13 years , metro line 4 : 16 years ** if ** they manage to keep the latest deadline ) and it 's more expensive per kilometer . 
  yeah . 
  a metro line is more expensive than the largest , most advanced scientific equipment ever built . 
  our politicians steal more , we 're just a lot more creative at hiding it . 
  afaik diesel has more taxes in the price ( more than half of this price is taxes and taxes of taxes ) . 
  that 's the gross minimal wage , before taxes . 
  the net minimal wage is half of that . 
  yeah ... we do n't stop at refining every existing form of corruption to the point of perfection , we discover entire new dimensions !, 
  gasoline ( 95 ) is 400-450 huf / l ( 1.44-1 .62 $ ) , diesel is a bit more . 
  and yeah , it 's extremely stupid . 
  what 's worse , they always justify raising the prices with `` lots of people travel without tickets , be mad at them , not us '' .
