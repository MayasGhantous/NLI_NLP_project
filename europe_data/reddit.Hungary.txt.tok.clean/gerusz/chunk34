  it has n't really occurred to them that lowering prices might lead to more people actually buying passes and tickets . 
  also , there 's no student / pensioner ticket , day pass or weekly pass . 
  if you 're a student , you either pay full prices or buy at least monthly passes ( there are also quarter-year , half-year and full-year passes and semester-passes for students ) . 
  if a student wants to visit for a day or two , they either buys a monthly pass or just says `` fuck it '' and do n't buy tickets . 
  that 's the gross minimal wage , the workers get half of that . 
  hungary : * minimal wage : 47,000 huf ( 170 $ ) * average wage : ~ 140,000 huf ( 504 $ ) * 1-month pass ( budapest , adult ) : 9,800 huf ( 35 $ , 20 % of the minimal wage ) * 1-month pass ( budapest , student ) : 3.850 huf ( 14 $ , 8 % of the minimal wage ) * single ticket : 320 huf / 1.15 $ ( bought before boarding ) / 400 huf / 1.44 $ ( bought at the station / on the vehicle ) and it is also the same for children over 6 years . 
  cry me a river , madrid . 
  yay , we made it to another top 10 list !, 
  hungary : 1 . 
  two during the 12 years are mandatory plus whatever you learn in college . 
  you must have an intermediate language exam to get your bsc , two to get your msc . 
  varies , i started english and german in kindergarten but other people may only start later ( 1st grade , 5th grade or 7th grade ) 3 . 
  english and german are universally preferred for their usefulness . 
  spanish , italian and french are gaining popularity . 
  foreign language education in schools is more of an alibi , actually . 
  yes , there are some schools that actually teach the languages well but in most schools one can get graduate knowing only present simple , present continuous and past simple with a very limited vocabulary . 
  most people who actually want to learn the languages attend to private courses or educate themselves from cartoon network and the internet . 
  yes , i 'm hungarian and lunch is usually the main meal of the day with two or three courses ( soup + main course is the usual and sometimes dessert ) . 
  and riding a bike in a suit is n't exactly * weird * , but usually only bike activists do it . 
  i 've never done it mostly because i only wore suits on special occasions before . 
  i 'm moving to maastricht in september though , so this might change . 
  inside the extremist politicians are just that - politicians . 
  they know that in times of crisis larger parts of the population are receptive to nationalistic-extremist rhetoric and adjusted their image accordingly to get into the national parliament and get a chance to steal as much as they can . 
  so a politician lied . 
  in other breaking news : the earth is round . 
  2-3 cm ^ 3 of lead , applied to the forehead with a supersonic speed . 
  you know what ? 
  we should work together to build a huge rocket , tie victor and viktor on the top and launch them into the sun . 
  what is it with victors and power ? 
  and of course there are the people who think that hungarians came from sirius ... 
  i fucking wish i was making this up . 
  aaaand that 's part of the reason why they should n't be taken seriously . 
  they just filled the far-right niche to get into the parliament . 
  fortunately . 
  just look at us . 
  large population . 
  dunno , they should have at least a greenish color : [ metal visage ] ( http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/metal-visage-mark/ ) . 
  hungary here , yup , i agree . 
  anything that takes away power from the corrupt and incompetent bunch that is our `` political elite '' is good . 
  i know that eu politicians are corrupt too , but at least they have a sense of subtlety . 
  * no , but they are similar enough * well , you can push the pedal to the metal on german highways unless there 's an explicit speed limit . 
  and the uk has left-hand traffic . 
  * usually no unless explicitly allowed by a light or something . 
  * [ wikipedia has you covered . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparison_of_european_traffic_laws ) they also have a page with [ comparison of traffic signs . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparison_of_european_traffic_signs ), 
  true . 
  winner-takes-it-all systems , however , tend to ignore a sizable amount of voters or might even result in the victory of someone who had fewer votes . 
  hungary has a mixed system and it has happened before . 
  fidesz is actively moving the system towards the us-system , in the end they could achieve supermajority ( 2/3 of the seats ) with only 1/3 of the votes thanks to the fractured opposition . 
  condorcet is turning in his grave . 
  extremist rise to power when moderates do n't offer solutions . 
  i 'm more worried about our utterly incompetent government and similarly incompetent moderate opposition . 
  hungary was n't on the `` most corrupt '' list ? 
  it must have cost us a fortune ... 
  what 's on p9 ? 
  i hate them because 1 . ), 
  they are n't honest . 
  from the chart , you would draw the conclusion that hungary has a low tax rate . 
  well , false . 
  we have huge taxes , they just are n't called taxes . 
  death of a thousand cuts . 
  yes , our main taxes are n't * that * high ( except vat , yay , i do n't think there 's a higher vat in the world ) . 
  but we have a bunch of other taxes that are n't included in the chart . 
  the government enacts a new law about a new tax every two weeks or so . 
  these taxes are 1-2 % each , but they add up . 
  they are stolen . 
  we are probably the most corrupt country in the eu ( or at least we are in the top 3 ) . 
  why should i pay taxes if it ends up in the pockets of simicska and the likes ? 
  we do n't see the benefits . 
  yeah , healthcare is * theoretically * free . 
  practically , you should pay 200-300 .000 huf ( ~ 1000 $ ) to the doctor as `` gratitude '' or your child and wife might not survive the birth or you might not wake up after the surgery . 
  yeah , the cops are out there ... giving you tickets , while you are afraid to go out after dark . 
  yeah , the bureaucracy is working ... except it 's fucking slow , expensive and inefficient . 
  yeah , our school system is great ... at training functional analphabets . 
  i could go on , but the thing is , with the 50 + % redistribution , the public services should work like a wonder . 
  they do n't . 
  meaning that the money gets stolen . 
  period . 
  edit : also , there is a hungarian joke that 's very fitting here : on a global conference about taxation , obama , merkel and orb\u00e1n are talking about their taxes . 
  obama says : `` well , people on average earn $ 4000 a month ^ * , they can live comfortably on $ 2000 , we take $ 1000 and do n't care about how they spend the remaining $ 1000 . '', 
  merkel says : `` well , people on average earn 3000 $ / month , they can live comfortably on 1500 $ / month , we take 1000 $ and do n't care about how they spend the remaining 500 $ . '', 
  orb\u00e1n : `` well , people on average earn 240.000 ft/month , they can survive on 160.000 ft/month , we take 140.000 and do n't care about how they are going to get the remaining 60.000 ft. '' * : numbers are made up , it 's a joke . 
  i wonder who will orb\u00e1n sit in our necks next . 
  anyone with a tiniest bit of a spine might rebel against him . 
  he might just fucking rewrite the ~ ~ constitution ~ ~ basic law to make hungary a presidential ~ ~ republic ~ ~ country . 
  he is not exactly popular , but still has a very devoted fanbase , making him probably the most popular politician . 
  the opposition is very fractured and their leaders are either relatively unknown ( lmp ) , hated ( dk , mszp ) or are even more divisive than orb\u00e1n ( jobbik ) . 
  meanwhile , the number of unsure people is an all-time high . 
  though this is all according to their plans , with the changes in the election process , they could get a majority or even supermajority with only 35 % of the votes . 
  the lower the turnout rate in 2014 , the better they 'll fare . 
  yes . 
  anything that takes away the power of hungarian politicians is good . 
  yup , i know . 
  also , the depiction of hungarians by early european historians matches with that of the mongolians . 
  however , modern hungarians are genetically mixed people . 
  ancient hungarians were n't xenophobic , they have assimilated a bunch of non-asian tribes during their journey . 
  also , due to [ `` magyarization '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/magyarization ) in the 19th century , most of the white population calls themselves hungarian , even though they have different ancestry . 
  you would n't be able to tell that a modern hungarian might have had mongol-looking ancestors - in fact , the most common mongoloid-looking trait , the high cheekbones comes from the jassic ethnic group ( cheekbones are commonly called `` jassic bones '' in hungarian ) . 
  i , personally , have at least italian , slovakian , germanic and jassic ancestry and such a mixed ancestry is n't uncommon at all , it 's rather the norm .
