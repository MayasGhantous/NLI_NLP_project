  still , we should reduce emissions as much as possible , it might buy us some time . 
  but once the permafrost releases the methane it 's game over . 
  no car , power-saving light bulbs and devices in general ( and my electricity provider only uses renewable energy anyway ) , beef only once per week at most . 
  i do n't know if there is anything else i can do . 
  heh , we ( hungarian ) even have an `` insulting formal '' . 
   `` biking rules are for others lol '' , when in reality biking rules are recommendations at best . 
  sure , there are some that are universally agreed upon , but tourists on bikes have a much higher probability of obeying a red light or a yield sign than the natives . 
  also , tourists usually do n't text / whatsapp / play pok\u00e9mon go while biking . 
  unlike the locals . 
  everyone : walking on the fucking bike lane . 
  ( i live in the netherlands . ), 
  when in hungary : assuming that people do n't understand your native language and talking shit about them . 
  sure , if you 're speaking spanish it 's a mostly safe assumption ( but then again , i was there to understand it , so only * mostly * safe ) but just how monumentally stupid do you have to be to talk shit about locals in english or german in the inner city of budapest ( which is surrounded by universities ) ? 
  `` mutyi '' which basically means theft condone / helped / done by the government using legislation customized for a certain group of people . 
  not really . 
  back in the `` heroic age '' of hungarian-made porn ( late 90s to mid-00s , when vhs and dvd were the preferred medium of distribution over tube sites and the internet in general ) there were some porn stars who were essentially celebs ( michelle wild , nicci bellucci ) . 
  the former pretty much disappeared , but i think the latter is still working as a topless dj . 
  standard hungarian in the 18th century was based on the dialects of the northeastern part of the country ( eger and such ) , simply because ferenc kazinczy , the leader of the language reform was from around there . 
  nowadays i ca n't say that any part of the country speaks the exact `` standard '' but all dialects are heavily influenced by the budapest dialect through bp-produced mass media . 
  calling it an `` age demographic crisis '' is incorrect . 
  it is a dependent / dependee ratio crisis , and making more dependents ( who will likely remove some people from the workforce , to boot ) wo n't fix it , it will only make it worse . 
  and the problem is n't a retirement crisis in 25 years . 
  it 's a retirement crisis in 2-3 years . 
  by the time babies born today grow up , the pensioner crisis they were supposed to solve wo n't exist anymore because , frankly , the baby boomers will be dead . 
  frankly because you guys are so filthy rich , and surprisingly lacking of political scandals ( at least ones that are heard internationally ) . 
  and you 're friendly with all your neighbors , whereas hungary ... well ... 
  still not a reason to increase the birth rate now . 
  frankly , if the western countries wanted a younger workforce to cushion themselves against the retirement of the post-war baby boom generation , they should have incentivized having children 25-30 years ago . 
  it was n't exactly an unexpected thing . 
  also note , that i did n't argue for no children at all . 
  i just do n't consider a decreasing population an issue in the long run . 
  sure , it 's going to suck for the next few years because the baby boom did n't have a strong enough `` echo boom '' and the governments did n't incentivize retirement savings properly ( even though they saw it coming ) , but automation will likely increase the efficiency of the working population faster than their number decreases . 
  increasing birth rate would be incredibly stupid . 
  first of all , why would a western country try to increase birth rate ? 
  mostly to support the retired generation . 
  but there are three things to consider : 1 . 
  babies born currently will enter the workforce in 18-25 years . 
  in 18-25 years automation will take over . 
  until then , every baby * reduces * the contributions to any state-funded retirement system . 
  ( first , there are usually tax breaks for larger families , and second , babies tend to take a parent ( the mother , most likely ) out of the workforce for years . ), 
  judging from this , your answer to immigration should n't be `` make more local babies '' ( unless you 're approaching things from a racial angle , and do n't even get me started on that ) . 
  besides , adult immigrants can enter the workforce almost straight away , which is what we kinda need to tide our retirement systems over until automation makes labour less necessary . 
  probably luxembourg . 
  as i was saying , it means cunt , yes . 
  it 's waaaaay less harsh than the english equivalent though . 
  in dutch : the plain and simple `` kut '' . 
  ( ipa pronunciation guide : kyt ) it literally means `` cunt '' , but it 's used more like `` shit '' . 
  but even shorter than that , which is why i like it . 
  in hungarian it 's `` m\u00e1s fasz\u00e1val veri a csal\u00e1nt '' ( ipa : nope , i wo n't even try ) , which translates to `` hitting the nettle bush with someone else 's dick '' and means doing something knowing that someone else will have to weather the negative consequences . 
  felcs\u00fat , obviously . 
  we 're probably going to have some pyramids , a spaceport , a maglev , a particle accelerator , etc. . . there before budapest 's public transportation vehicles stop catching fire . 
  and both of the ones that are holidays were defeated by russia . 
  the inner party decides to pass a law . 
  the representatives of the party ( basically the inner party and some up-and-coming asslickers from the outer party ) vote it in . 
  if the president decides to pretend that he is anything other than a puppet , then repeat step 2 . 
  additionally , we used to have 1 and 2 forint coins until a few years ago . 
  the largest coin right now is the 200 forint one , worth approximately 2/3rd of a euro . 
  yeah , but then dolphie got rid of that border . 
  in hungary it mostly manifests as glorification / romanticization of conscription by people whose memories of it are severely distorted by nostalgia . 
  that really irks me because it 's the 21st century . 
  bachelor 's degree is the new high school , master 's is the new bachelor 's , and 3 years of work experience is the new master 's . 
  losing even a year after high school or college would already put you at a disadvantage vs people from countries without conscription . 
  and a single year is basically useless . 
  also , a conscript army is basically just target practice for drone pilots . 
  if you want your citizens to be able to defend their country in case of war , teach them guerrilla tactics . 
  it must be somewhere in the top 10 causes of death . 
  at least you like us \u2764, 
  ( hungarian living in the netherlands ) where to start . 
  even assuming that wilders gets the most votes ( right now he is neck to neck with vvd , so that might not even happen ) , that only means ~ 16 % of the votes . 
  the dutch election system is completely proportional , and he simply does not have enough potential coalition partners to reach 50 % +1 in the second chamber ( the `` important one '' ) . 
  there are a number of left/liberal parties who are willing to cooperate with each other and the vvd . 
  yes , wilders will claim fraud if he does n't get the most votes , and throw a tantrum , call the netherlands a dictatorship of the leftist elite ( nice little oxymoron there , but anyway ) , etc. . . if he does but is n't asked to form a coalition ( the one who does the asking is someone appointed by the first chamber iirc ) but that 's just the iso standard populist reaction to defeat and wo n't get him into the government . 
  there is a pretty good chance that the next coalition ( probably vvd+d 66 + pvda + gl , maybe + sp or + pvdd ) will be unstable and wo n't last until the end of the next term , but i think that the threat of the big bad wolf geert will keep them together . 
  \\* altright thing , but you probably do n't encounter those people outside reddit . 
  it can get really touristy though . 
  if you 're tired of overpriced l\u00e1ngos and beer and muddy water , make sure to visit the hills near the northern shore . 
  i also have a stone that keeps the tigers away , it 's only $ 100 if you want it . 
  also , most illegal immigrants in the us arrive legally with a tourist visa then `` forget '' to go home . 
  a border wall will do jack shit against this type of immigration . 
  we already had our trump in power since 2010 , so no , not really . 
  btw . 
  if you want to know trump 's playbook , just check out what orb\u00e1n has been doing . 
  i 'm pretty sure they employ the same advisor . 
  whatever the government throws in to distract the populace from their latest theft . 
  most recently , the referendum about the olympics . 
  i still do n't understand why they backed down . 
  i mean , this way they could spin it as `` some snotty-nosed liberals from the inner city destroyed a country 's dream of organizing the olympic games '' instead of `` the majority of budapest said no to the olympics '' , but this is , again , propaganda that only their own voters will eat ( and for those voters it does n't matter , if orb\u00e1n shat in their mouths , they would sing praises about the flavor ) . 
  whereas if they went into the voting , they could have kept the public 's attention occupied with the campaign for months ( and of course they could have stuffed the pockets of their friends who own the newspapers , tv stations and billboards ... ) . 
  i have to consider the idea that the olympics ( or at least the preparations , it 's not like we could have gotten it unless we bribed the ioc more than the other countries ) was their actual big steal this time , and the less attention paid to it , the better . 
  most of the country . 
  the soviets were fans of heavy industry and propped it up in the entire country with the planned economy . 
  when that collapsed , so did the heavy industry . 
  some concrete examples : * [ csepel industries ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/@47.4270887,19.0535756,3a,75y,180.88h,92.32t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sbblcexuhmwrwnqrwugo_5w!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?shorturl=1 ) - it used to be a * gigantic * factory occupying a significant chunk of budapest 's district xxi ( csepel ) , maybe even extending to over a square kilometer ( and replace that `` maybe '' with a `` definitely '' if the industrial port is included ) . 
  nowadays it 's occupied by small industrial companies trying to survive and rotting , rusting public health hazards / death traps / urbex treasure troves . 
  parts of the factory are still producing steel , but all in all it ca n't compete with western quality and price . 
  [ there 's a wondrous piece of socialist realism on the main entrance though .

  nowadays it 's one of the poorest towns of the country .
