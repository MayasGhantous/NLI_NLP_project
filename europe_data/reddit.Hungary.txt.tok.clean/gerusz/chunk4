  passes are cheap compared to w-europe but expensive compared to local wages . 
  some people consider having ( and using ) a car a status symbol . 
  they would switch to a car as soon as they can afford it ( or even if they ca n't but can get a loan ) and these people cause gigantic traffic jams in the inner city . 
  the rest of the commuters are either poor or use bkv simply because it 's faster . 
  most of the transportation in the inner city is electric , trams 4 and 6 are the most used tram lines in europe . 
  there are still trams and trolleys in the outer parts too but buses are more frequent there because they do n't require special infrastructure . 
  you can carry bikes on some vehicles - for a full-priced ticket . 
  however , especially in the inner city the grid is so dense that you do n't really need it . 
  p+r was something always promised but never really delivered , not in the volume required by the suburban commuters . 
  and it 's not incentivised at all . 
  biking is viable but the infrastructure is spotty . 
  and you should have some good locks . 
  the traffic morale is utterly despicable though . 
  going car-free is most definitely an option - if you live within the city or in one of the suburbs that have a proper connection to the city . 
  when i was living there , i lived car-free , using public transportation , walking or biking everywhere . 
  common complaints : * expensive passes . 
  a monthly adult pass costs 20-22 % of the net minimal wage . 
  * expensive tickets and an antiquated system . 
  the tickets are 350 huf ( ~ 1.15 $ ) , 450 huf when bought on the vehicle . 
  they are single trip tickets : you pay that amount regardless of whether you go two stops or twenty . 
  while there is student ( and pensioner , though eu citizens over 65 travel free ) discount on the monthly and longer passes , there is none on the tickets . 
  there is also no student discount on daily tickets ( 1650 huf , almost a fifth of an adult monthly pass or half of a student monthly pass ) . 
  * jerkass employees . 
  some ticket controllers get off on harassing the passengers . 
  and good luck finding one speaking english , they ca n't even speak hungarian properly . 
  in the touristic seasons they usually hire students to translate for them . 
  also they always harass the weaker people . 
  disabled , children , women , the elderly , students . 
  never the loud and dirty groups . 
  * dirty vehicles . 
  sometimes if you smell something and ask yourself `` what the shit is this ? 
  '' , you have already answered the question . 
  [ yes , it is .

  hungary : 1 . 
  [ the parliament building ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/parlament_with_bus_on_danube.jpg ) - yes , it might be filled with scum , but the building itself is beautiful . 
  [ holl\u00f3k\u0151 ] ( http://www.holloko.hu/images/headerimage1.png ) ( raven 's rock ) - unesco world heritage site , authentic village preserving the pre-20th-century village life . 
  [ the esztergom basilica ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/ostrihom_bazilika.jpg ) - newer than it looks , still it 's probably * the * most beautiful church in the country . 
  another contender would be ... 4 . 
  the [ mathias church ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/matthias_church%2c_budapest.jpg ) . 
  it 's far older , but it 's been rebuilt quite a couple of times . 
  however , during the most comprehensive reconstruction in the 19th century they aimed for restoring the original state . 
  the [ sz\u00e9chenyi chain bridge ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/lanchid-bp.jpg/640px-lanchid-bp.jpg ) , probably the best known symbol of budapest . 
  ( this one was blown up by the germans for a change ... ) 6 . 
  the [ tihany peninsula ] ( http://www.hoteltihany.hu/felsziget5a.jpg ) - other than its obvious touristic importance , the founding letter of the abbey contains the first known written hungarian words . 
  [ the castle of eger ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/megyesz%c3%a9khely_-_heves_megye_-_eger.jpg ) - other than its historical importance , the siege of eger is the topic of one of the most popular novels , egri csillagok ( lit .

  i was n't talking about non-voters . 
  stop lying . 
  fidesz got 44.54 % of the votes . 
  that is a relative majority . 
  55 % of the voters voted for someone else . 
  i 'm just saying that the fact that he was elected does n't mean that he ca n't be a dictator . 
  most dictators were elected too . 
  and while he might have supermajority in the parliament , he got that with only a relative majority of the votes , meaning that more than a half of the country voted for someone else . 
   there 's plenty to criticize , but to call an elected president ( with supermajority no less ) a dictator ? 
  i 'm going to invoke a godwin now , but it 's relevant : hitler was elected too . 
  president , sure . 
  can you sign a paper ? 
  will you sign any paper that 's put in front of you ? 
  if the answer to both are `` yes '' , you are pretty much qualified for being the president . 
  prime minister ... now that 's another question . 
  the way anyone becomes anything in this fucking country : he is a friend of someone . 
  our parties have worked long to create the sharp divide . 
  having fanatical voters and a clean-cut enemy means never having to explain themselves . 
  during ww1 and ww2 there were n't any nukes around . 
  mad makes it unlikely that russia would start ww3 if the eu would invade the area . 
  why ? 
  do you think the economic output would stay the same ? 
  also , the loans taken out by the country were n't spent in the same way . 
  yes , the central region produces 40 % of the economic output , yet receives only ~ 20 % of the government spending . 
  so why should the new country own 40 % of the debt ? 
  proportionate to what ? 
  : say budapest and the rest of central hungary becomes independent ( impossible situation , but let 's just make a thought experiment for now ) . 
  the region is ~ 16 % of the country 's area , 25 % of the population and produces 40 % of the country 's economical output . 
  should the new country budapestia take 16 , 25 or 40 % of the debt ? 
  plus , y' know , if they destroyed the plane and it came to light , ukraine would lose every political ally in an instant . 
  if it were a false flag attack , what are the potential outcomes ? 
  best case scenario : open war in eastern ukraine between nato forces and separatists . 
  not really a good option . 
  worst case scenario : their allies cut ties with them and the russians invade , open war in the whole country . 
  way too risky . 
  it 's like a drunk german trying to speak english with a similarly drunk englishman writing it down . 
  not crash . 
  crash implies an accident . 
  it 's murder . 
  and those are in limburg , one of the most religious areas . 
  the bookstore is most definitely the formerly-selexys , and i think that basicfit is in maastricht too . 
  ( there 's also one here that is used for parties by frats . ), 
  a groan usually , because 90 % of the time it 's about how racist we are or how we 're preparing to exterminate the gypsies and the jews any minute now . 
  you forgot the million from mol , it looks like our biggest company had barely enough profit to buy to large whopper menus .

  hungarian political landscape , in a nutshell : 1 . 
  people who are fucking up the country 2 . 
  people who have fucked up the country 3 . 
  fascists, 
  people would give a crap if there was an alternative . 
  no one likes lobbying , except politicians . 
  i do n't know if this law has to be ratified by every country or if some can opt out of it ... but if it 's the former , the telco lobby only has to buy enough representatives in a small country to block the law .
