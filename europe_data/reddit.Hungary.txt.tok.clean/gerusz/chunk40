  and the main drawback is that they are the same fucking party that governed between 2002 and 2010 and handed the 2/3rd victory to fidesz . 
  except that now they splintered into a thousand tiny parties and turned the infighting up to 11 . 
  they are cowardly , spineless thieves who are just as incompetent at governing as fidesz , the only reasons to vote for them are that 1 ) they are not authoritarian , which will always be my # 1 priority ( seriously , who wants some strongman to tell them how to live ? 
  ) , 2 ) they are just as incompetent at stealing as they are at governing , whereas fidesz are exceptional thieves , and they do n't even try to act ashamed , when they are caught they just double down , and 3 ) there is no realistic chance of them winning , but there 's a pretty good chance of them blocking a third 2/3rd fidesz term , which ( thanks to the more fptp-biased system made by fidesz ) can only be done if i 'm voting for the biggest opposition alliance , and with the euromonies being cut off in 2020 + the vast majority of our boomers going into retirement in 2018-2019 ( only state-funded pensions exist , the private retirements were stolen back in 2011 ) + the continued emigration , a default in the next government cycle seems unavoidable . 
  a fidesz without a 2/3rd majority would have a harder time enacting the measures required to avoid it , or to stretch out the effects . 
  i want the shitpile they built in the last close-to-seven years to come tumbling down on their necks * hard * . 
  which one ? 
  the ones who fled from the nazis before/during ww2 , the ones who fled from the commies after 1956 , or the ones fleeing from orb\u00e1n right now ? 
  the first two groups are usually fully assimilated , with children and grandchildren who were already born in their new countries . 
  they are frequently the `` rich western uncles '' of their relatives in hungary . 
  ( especially the '56 refugees , because the ones who fled from the nazis were usually jewish and took their whole family for obvious reasons ) . 
  the last group is different . 
  we 're not always assimilated , especially the ones who are doing unskilled labor . 
  it is generally agreed that if someone wants to start a new life in the other country , they should avoid other hungarians : both the ones offering and the ones asking for help will likely use you . 
  he is actually losing votes . 
  peil and de stemming consistently show him a few seats above what ipsos and i&o show , but he lost a few seats according to every polling company . 
  i guess this will only last until the next terrorist attack in europe , but still . 
  the netherlands does n't hate them . 
  sure , proportionally rotterdam has the most of them ( thanks , germany ) , but there are a bunch in amsterdam ( mostly in the outer districts ) or den haag ( around the central train station ) . 
  no one complains about stuff being far away either . 
  i 've been living in the netherlands since 2012 , so i kinda have to . 
  and that 's why i was n't familiar with the exact events of the 2010-2012 minority government either . 
  it 's also interesting that peil shows a pro-pvv and anti-vvd bias , whereas ipsos is quite anti-pvv . 
  i 'm not that familiar with peil , can you comment on this ? 
  the dutch election system is fully proportional . 
  [ the latest polls ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_dutch_general_election,_2017 ) show that party ( pvv ) getting between 26-35 seats out of the 150 , and many parties refuse a coalition with them . 
  ( note : the polls show `` seats expected '' , not percentage . ), 
  * vvd ( current biggest government party ) proclaimed that they wo n't have a coalition with them , and it 's mutual . 
  now given they all are politicians , i would n't take this as set in stone , but still unlikely . 
  * pvda and sp are left-wing , they wo n't have anything to do with wilders either . 
  * cda is one of the parties that might enter a coalition with pvv * d66 is fiercely pro-eu , no way in hell they will enter a coalition with wilders * cu is another of pvv 's potential partners * gl is also left-wing and green , neither of which are compatible with pvv * sgp is another one that might be open to a coalition * pvdd is another left-green , this time more green than left . 
  still not pvv-partner material * 50 + - another potential coalition partner all in all , pvv and its potential partners are polling at 66-67 seats at best . 
  it 's much more likely that the left parties enter a coalition with the moderately right vvd ( as they have for the last five years ) . 
  cultural appropriation was originally `` taking something culturally significant and mimicking it without observing its meaning '' . 
  like , i do n't know , taking the kippah and turning it into a fashion accessory . 
  and i can easily see how this can be offensive . 
  simply wearing / eating / listening to something invented by another culture is not cultural appropriation , no matter how much some tumblrina sjws want it to be . 
  in theory it is illegal . 
  in practice it 's everywhere .

  which is also how they are usually referred to . ), 
  this is generally done already . 
  but there is one huge problem i see with such a system , namely : who determines these limits ? 
  we can count on politicians being selfish and doing everything for their job security . 
  if , say , only four parties get more than 5 % on an election and together they have enough votes to modify the constitution , then they will do just that and introduce a 5 % threshold . 
  there is a natural threshold anyway : ( 100 / | representatives | ) % . 
  better than an fptp system or a system with fptp components where there are two large general parties and fuck-all representation for smaller groups . 
  the dutch election system to hungary . 
  yes , the parliament is a glorious mess with a dozen parties , some extremely niche . 
  but this is a feature , not a bug : at least everyone can find a party they can actually vote for . 
  https://what-if.xkcd.com/53/ https://what-if.xkcd.com/imgs/a/53/drain_nl.png, 
  i wonder if there 's a single country in europe where the government does n't use the eu as a scapegoat for everything that goes wrong . 
  in the netherlands it depends on the company . 
  some have pickup locations in shops , others may leave the package by a neighbor , and at least once i had to bike to a warehouse in an industrial park to pick up my stuff ( \u2764 dhl ) . 
  predominantly on the internet . 
  others already mentioned screen sizes , but it 's increasingly common to list them in metric , especially above 76 cm ( 30 '' ) . 
  one very important area where i personally encounter inches are bike wheel sizes . 
  one can also find oneself thinking in inches when buying a hard drive as well , though it 's not like i have to convert them or anything , simply because they only exist in 3 standard sizes anyway . 
  oh , and recipes . 
  fuck that . 
  i can kinda tolerate pounds and ounces ( though i do n't have the faintest idea about the * weight * of an ounce ) , but the semi-standardized cups , spoons , etc. . . drive me crazy . 
  i swear i would be more comfortable with klingon units . 
  ( authentic quo'onos breakfast \u00e1 ` la khales : take one cheb of gagh and two tlho ` ren of bloodwine . 
  do not cook unless you 're a petaq ' . 
  serve cold , just like revenge . ), 
  and an appreciation for our dangerous wildlife . 
  `` i accidentally sat down to take a shit in the wrong part of the forest and now my ass is covered in nettle sores . 
  but i 'm thankful it 's not gympie gimpie , because i would be trying to chew at the veins in my wrists to escape the pain . '', 
  a dodge ram has no place in the inner city of rotterdam . 
  i think there used to be domestic flights between budapest and debrecen but not anymore . 
  frankly , with all the security measures it is frequently faster to hop onto a train or take the car . 
  oh , so * that 's * why the famous poppodium in tilburg is called 013 . 
  vli . 
  what ? 
  no , far from it . 
  maybe i agree with him on this one point , but i 'm not going to call for the proletariat to take over the state and take control of the means of production . 
  because some of us do n't trust our local governments and hope that a moderately corrupt federal government would rein them in instead of letting the countries descend into blatant cleptocracies . 
  in its current form : a concept invented in the 19th century to make it easier for the ruling class to mobilize people . 
  it 's a joke based on dichter , is n't it ? 
  because if it is , then ouch . 
  back in 2008 i waited a whole afternoon for a cast removal , and hungarian healthcare just went downhill from there . 
  at least in canada you probably wo n't die from a hospital infection , so there 's that . 
  yeah , kinda . 
  i 'm pretty sure the strippers would prefer if you made it rain in 5 $ notes instead of 500 fts though . 
  ( and up until 2009 we had 200 ft notes too . ), 
  no , our strippers are paid a living wage so they do n't need tips . 
   budapest is what belgrade could ( and should ) be one day . 
  we say the same thing about vienna and budapest sometimes . 
   it 's fun to try to deduce what a word means just based on my german vocabulary . 
  dutch is like someone tried to create a fantasy conlang with a dice . 
  1-3 : a german word with a different spelling , 4 : an english word with a different spelling , 5 : a french word and 6 : make up a compound word for something that is one word in all of these languages, 
  well , they are not * necessarily * pervy , but above a certain age the promise of an impromptu wet t-shirt contest brings it out from the guys . 
  on easter monday the men go around town and `` water '' women who welcome them with food , drinks , give them painted eggs , sweets and maybe money from female relatives to children . 
  in the modern times , this `` watering '' is done with cologne ( or , by the more considerate men , water from a cologne flask ) but classically it was done with buckets of water , or carbonated water from siphons . 
  ( sometimes it 's still done that way , depending on how traditionalist and/or sadist the guys are - female friends and relatives of firefighters dread this day , for the fire engine can and will be used for this purpose ) . 
  obviously this day sees the most duis * by far . 
  hungarian in the netherlands here . 
  the millisecond they notice that you 're not dutch , it 's game over and you get englishwalled . 
  he might get the most votes , but the dutch election system is almost completely proportional ( the rounding method can distort it somewhat , but not more than 1-2 % ) . 
  pvv is neck-to-neck with vvd ( currently the biggest government party , moderate-conservative which translates to bland and wishy-washy ) , and the latter - being bland and wishy-washy - can find coalition partners much more easily than the former .
