  fun fact : rijwiel is also the exact translation of the german `` fahrrad '' . 
  we pay money to the government . 
  they promise that they are going to use it to build / maintain schools , hospitals and such , but then they build useless and unnecessarily large soccer stadiums and similar useless shit . 
  or spend it on government propaganda and nonsense referendums . 
  or simply steal it . 
  los angeles : * homeless situation is not worse than in budapest . 
  much worse than rotterdam though . 
  * your public transportation system is bad and you should feel bad !, 
  both bkv and ret beat metro . 
  * the contrast between poor and rich people is gigantic . 
  and this is coming from a city with areas like [ this ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/@47.5195864,19.0186492,3a,75y,63.78h,87.23t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sngv0warhd3iptx4yzldiea!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) and [ this ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/@47.4909789,19.0861938,3a,75y,131.31h,97.4t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sftzt2heabbmwwx8z264jjq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) . 
  yeah , his past is not spotless , especially the history of his companies , but 1 . ), 
  he is remarkably consistent , he 's been a straight-up liberal since he entered politics in 2002 , and 2 . ), 
  he is probably the only mp who is actively investigating government corruption . 
  he was also fined for being a danger to social order . 
  that 's some serious punk cred . 
  belgian abbey beers ( and other beers in that style ) !, 
  yummy !, 
  they are bloody expensive in hungary ( in stores at least ; in the few belgian pubs they are actually cheaper than in belgium ) , but moving to the netherlands had this one very specific upside : plenty of beers in stores , and most of them are $ 2 or so per bottle . 
  depends on the preparation method , i guess . 
  and the roasting method . 
  sure , coffee beans are from ethiopia , but european countries ( mainly france , austria and italy ) have invented many of the current preparation methods . 
  of course everything boils down ( pun not intended , but recognized and chuckled at ) to infusing hot water with ground coffee beans , but of the many possible ways to do it , europe has invented the most . 
  besides , if we exclude anything that is not native to europe , then hungary does n't have a cuisine at all ( ok , that 's not true , there are some foods that do n't have paprika in it , but still ... ) . 
  trump scares me more . 
  clinton is predictably corrupt , she would probably just keep the current status quo . 
  the thing is , the current american status quo is not that bad , things could get much worse . 
  trump , however , is unpredictably insane . 
  yes , that 's a beautiful sentiment , and i 'm pretty sure the astronauts and the space agencies share it . 
  however , the latter are subordinate to the governments who might not . 
  the only country that can send * people * to the iss is currently russia . 
  which is politically less than ideal . 
  you might know him as john von neumann . 
  and of course the rest of the martians . 
  hungary is a bit ... different . 
  i live in the netherlands and the first few times when i tried to ask for decagrams of cheese , it was as if i spoke chinese . 
  but using decagrams or deciliters is just more logical imo , when it comes to consumables . 
  you almost never use quantities below 1 decagram or 1 deciliter , so why bother with a unit that has a higher resolution ? 
  yep , i only had to carry it around in the 2007/2008 year . 
  i also had to deal with an unholy hybrid of sap and blackboard here in the netherlands ... not too great . 
  but neptun is n't ( or was n't ; have n't used it since 2012 ) compatible with chrome , and barely compatible with firefox . 
  and of course the overloading , it 's something that could be solved by simply staggering the course and exam registrations by department , but it does n't occur to the administrators ... 
  it was back in 2007 ( and yes , bute ) , and we were still told during registration that certain fields * have * to be filled cursively . 
  getting rid of the booklet , well , good riddance . 
  but neptun sucks just as much . 
  or more . 
  i can still write like this if i really have to , but honestly it 's just damn slow . 
  but even during the university registration ( that was the last time i was forced to write like that ) , most people could n't write like this . 
  i wrote the cursive part in the `` index '' for 5-6 people next to me . 
  whether to use j or ly . 
  in modern hungarian they denote the same sound ( german j or english y ) , but both are used because traditionally ly was something else ( afaik something between l and modern j ) . 
  there are some useful rules to decide which one to use for a number of cases ( foreign words : always j , start of the word : always j except for lyuk ( hole ) , etc. . . ) , but mostly one just has to learn them . 
  when listing compound words with the same last part ( let 's symbolize it now with ax , bx and cx ) , you can and should do it like this . 
  many people forget the hyphens . 
  the - e construct . 
  `` i 'll go see if he has done it '' would be translated to hungarian as `` megn\u00e9zem , hogy megcsin\u00e1lta-e . '' the hyphen is frequently left out . 
  the capitalization of adjectives that are formed from proper nouns that are made of multiple words . 
  does n't help that it 's inconsistent as fuck . 
  last name is always appropriate . 
  some countries ( like the netherlands ) will jump to first name basis after the first email , but maybe not with asian companies . 
  and yet others ( like hungary ) are in the middle of a transition , where the older generation will expect mr. lastname , but the younger ones are fine with first name basis . 
  if scotland becomes independent , then scotland . 
  if it does n't , then maybe serbia , sometime in the 2020s . 
  no , quite the opposite actually . 
  it was usually one of the top voted comment for every fidesz-idiocy on 444 before they enacted some stricter moderation rules . 
  though it was also a popular comment on v ` b\u0151r before they moved to \u00c1tl\u00e1tsz\u00f3 . 
  yep , lmpvs is usually used when there is an autofilter that filters out `` l\u00e1mpavas '' . 
   jbqa = j\u00f3 ( buzi ) kurva anyj\u00e1t nope , that means j\u00f3 * b\u00fcd\u00f6s * kurva anyj\u00e1t ( his/her stinky whore of a mother ) . 
  as someone learning dutch , lem me take a crack at expanding the latter group : * ajb = alsjeblieft . 
  the similar acronym for the formal version ( a.u.b. ), 
  is actually used in public places . 
  except in limburg where the french s.v.p. 
  is used . 
  hungary : * officially 24-hour clock . 
  * everyday speech : sorta-am/pm : 0-3 : '' \u00e9jjel '' ( night ) , 3-6 : `` hajnal '' ( dawn ) , 7-10 : `` reggel '' ( morning ) , 10-12 : `` d\u00e9lel\u0151tt '' ( before noon ) , 12-17 : `` d\u00e9lut\u00e1n '' ( afternoon ) , 17-24 : `` este '' ( evening ) . 
  these boundaries are blurry , but this is the general usage . 
  * writing : depends on the person . 
  i generally use 24-hour clock , but others might use the same as above . 
  that 's like a dutch snackbar . 
  [ most commonly found on train stations . 
  i was taught british , but if i had restricted myself to what i was taught in school , i could n't even introduce myself . 
  i self-learned most of the english i know from tv shows , books , and the internet , which is predominantly american . 
  either a slavic loanword , or the slavic languages loaned it from us , it 's unclear . 
  but it means exactly what it means in slavic languages ( though we only use it as a noun and an adjective ; the polish use it as punctuation ) . 
  translation : how the < lots of hard to translate but fairly vile blasphemy  would n't we enjoy it ? 
  it 's one of our national sports !, 
  ( just search for `` a magyar nyelv sz\u00e9ps\u00e9gei '' on youtube to get a teaser . 
  it 's even subtitled ! ), 
  edit : [ here 's the video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4qcvdtbk_w ) . 
  turn on the annotations for the translations !, 
  we hang together , or we hang separately . 
  anyway , `` nation '' in its current form was invented in the 19th century , and it was quickly overtaken by those in power as a method for psychological control . 
  and people eat it up , because it gives them a sort-of participation trophy . 
  native : hungarian . 
  fluent : english . 
  used-to-be-fluent : german , spanish . 
  with some practice , they would come back . 
  getting better : dutch . 
  know-the-basics-of-but-forgot-a-lot : japanese . 
  i speak the budapest dialect of hungarian .
