  it 's somewhat different from the literary standard , which is based on the northeastern dialect ( the leader of the language reformation movement in the 18th century was from the ne-region ) : * budapest-dialect is much more monotonous and businesslike . 
  compared to this dialect , most other dialects ( literary included ) are far more melodic and show a greater variation in vowel length . 
  * hungarian is already pro-drop ( it helps that the subject is implied by the conjugation of the predicate , and sometimes even the object is unnecessary ) , but the budapest dialect has a psychotic hatred for personal pronouns . 
  * this is now part of everyday hungarian outside bp too , but it started here : we tend to use definite articles in front of personal names . 
  it is grammatically incorrect , of course , but its meaning is fairly subtle and encodes a lot . 
  when i say `` a zoli m\u00e1r megint ber\u00fagott '' ( `` the zoli got drunk again '' ) , that `` a '' implies that `` the specific zoli that is the first person we think about when we hear the name `` zoli '' , especially in the current conversational context , which includes our common friends and acquaintances , the current situation , and the fact that this is a zoli that frequently gets drunk . '', 
  ( this is also one of the subtleties of hungarian that makes it fucking easy to find out if someone is a foreigner , even if they have otherwise perfect accent and grammar . ), 
  * also , probably like most metropolitan dialects , budapest dialect is * fast * compared to standard hungarian . 
  no , they are social democratic . 
  but then again , the policies you call `` socialist '' are actually social democratic too . 
   try to find the church of the first picture on the second one !, 
  found it !, 
  but i live here , so it 's cheating ... 
  but seriously , rotterdam is worth a visit . 
  very different from the rest of the country , less traditional and more , in lack of a better word , `` hipster '' , but in the good way . 
  yeah , we use gypsies instead for that joke , and add that they could n't find a virgin either . 
  there are much more than two sides , that 's why the whole thing is such a clusterfuck . 
  it would n't be nearly enough without asshole politicians making things worse . 
  yeah , creativity was n't exactly the strong suit of the settlers ... 
  there 's that whole trianon-thing ... 
  sure , the hilton across the square is pretty bad , and the apartment building next door could use a cleaning , but at least those did n't go out of their way to be ugly . 
  they are just functional buildings ( that happen to be ugly ) . 
  this tower , however , was explicitly designed to be an oppressive concrete monstrosity . 
  thick concrete walls , tiny uniform windows all across , a digital clock ( barely visible in daylight ) , and that decorative sphere ... thing on the upper side of the northwestern corner , just the perfect storm of everything that was wrong with architecture in that age . 
  [ by far the worst in rotterdam .

  [ for people without webgl ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gn82h0u.jpg ), 
  of course , but people perceive it as safer , which is what actually matters . 
  18 mpg is approximately 13 liters per 100 km ( that 's how most of europe measures fuel efficiency ) . 
  which is * a lot . 
  * i 'm aware that the 240 is a gas guzzler , my family used to have one , but our current cars ( a 850 and an s40 ) can get down to 7 liters / 100 km with conservative driving ( that 's 34-36 mpg ) . 
  and they are pretty old . 
  newer models can be even more efficient . 
  it 's an arms race . 
  basically , people who ca n't drive for shit buy bigger cars to be safer in case of a collision , which in turn forces the rest of the people to buy big cars to be safe from idiots in tanks , and this goes on ad infinitum . 
  dirt-cheap gasoline does n't help either . 
  fuck no , it 's considered a battleship . 
  ( a surprisingly agile battleship , but still a battleship . ), 
  hungary : if you 're a guy , there is no special way of dressing up ( though we like polo shirts and short sleeve button-ups ) . 
  if you 're a girl though , and it 's summer : slut it up !, 
  i just came back from a visit ( i live in the netherlands ) , and holy shit , you see more skin on a budapest street than in a dutch swimming pool . 
  what to do : drink and complain . 
  other activities depend on which subculture you want to fit into . 
  if you want to blend in with the yuppies , you should go to bars serving hungarian craft beers and drink those . 
  ( the hungarian craft beer scene started up ~ 5 years ago , but it 's fairly successful despite the price range that puts them out of reach for a huge part of the population . ), 
  if you want to blend in with the university students , go to the popular clubs / bars in the jewish quarter ( shows a bit of overlap with the other places above ) , but drink only the cheapest beers and/or shots . 
  alternatively , go to the bars near the university buildings on the buda side between the szabads\u00e1g bridge and the r\u00e1k\u00f3czi bridge . 
  fair warning : since that area houses the technological university and the science buildings of the elte , there wo n't be too many girls . 
  if you want to blend in with the high school students or the middle-aged population , you 'll have to find a cheap dive bar outside the inner city . 
  you 'll have to learn hungarian to truly blend in , of course . 
  but there 's a bit of a cheat code : find a mixed company of hungarians and foreigners , and speak english with an accent like b\u00e9la lugosi 's dracula . 
  you might be able to pass as a hungarian until someone wants to talk to you in hungarian . 
  to be fair , tourists loitering around on the red lane of death have it coming . 
  we saw a lot of government propaganda telling migrants what they should and should n't do . 
  strictly in hungarian , of course . 
  tipping , not as a way to thank someone for good service , but as a way of giving a living wage to restaurant employees . 
  attempting to introduce a `` tipped minimal wage '' would be political suicide over here . 
  the german bombing in wwii destroyed most of the old buildings , so this is how the outside of the inner city looks like . 
  except for [ delfshaven ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/@51.9072895,4.4487325,3a,75y,278.7h,96.49t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1skpxrdxmum0-uvqd8tg67va!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?shorturl=1 ) and some buildings in the [ oude noorden ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/@51.9350873,4.4819926,3a,75y,270.19h,96.76t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1snaqwu_17ntx2m8papwamxa!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?shorturl=1 ) ( pictured : quite possibly the narrowest building in rotterdam , at the moment [ it houses an architecture company ] ( http://nov82.nl/nieuw-atelier-1e-pijnackerstraat-69/ ) ) . 
  with , or without bribes ? 
  `` bankautomata '' or `` bankomat '' . 
  but many of us understand atm as well . 
  do n't confuse the nicely worded pro-eu advert orb\u00e1n published in that uk newspaper with being pro-eu . 
  his internal communication is radically different . 
  of course those billboards and newspaper ads are in hungarian , so that does n't quite make it abroad . 
  fun fact : the hungarian title of the movie was l'ecs\u00f3 . 
  my favorite hungarian recipe ( and a fairly simple one at that ) is the [ lecs\u00f3 ] ( http://www.thehungarydish.com/lecso-recipe-guest-post-by-peter-pawinski/ ) . 
  basically a vegetable stew with sausage . 
  fairly common in hungary in the warmer months . 
  though cars are still dominant , and it does n't help that the new city leaders in budapest are taking a decidedly '70s approach to city planning and managing traffic . 
  how do they manage to do this : [ this article ] ( http://www.tallinn.ee/eng/freepublictransport/uudis-tallinn-introduced-the-concept-of-free-public-transport-in-vilnius?&amp;filter_otsing_uudis_rubriik_id=160 ) might explain it . 
  the budget given in the same article calculates to [ $ 154/person/year ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%e2%82%ac61000000+%2f+population+of+tallinn ) . 
  of course it would be more if we only consider the taxpayers . 
  an additional source of the funding is mentioned in [ this article ] ( http://citiscope.org/story/2014/free-public-transit-tallinn-hit-riders-yields-unexpected-results ) : the construction of the new water and sewer infrastructure was completed , which freed up a part of the budget . 
  also , since only registered residents of tallinn get to ride for free , it provided an incentive for the residents to actually register there , and apparently part of the income tax in estonia goes to the registered residence . 
  ( someone from estonia could shed a better light to this . ), 
  overworked and underpaid staff , months-long waiting lists even for urgent examinations , crowded waiting rooms , horrible conditions , [ `` interesting '' food ] ( http://korhazikoszt.tumblr.com/ ) , mandatory `` gratuity '' if you want to be treated as something resembling a human , any doctor or nurse who speaks a foreign language is already working in one of the western countries speaking said language - unless they run a private practice in the country , which is where they will try to reroute you to skip the aforementioned months-long waiting lists , etc. . . 
  depends on the school , of course . 
  most gimn\u00e1ziums probably do n't even have a teacher for a language that is not english or german , but in budapest there is a chance that you can choose spanish , french , or russian even in a public school . 
  and in private schools ( or public schools where rich kids go ) the sky is the limit . 
  i do n't know if it 's a new thing or not ( i graduated gimn\u00e1zium 9 years ago ) . 
  the `` two languages '' part is definitely not new , i also had to choose two , but english was n't mandatory . 
  of course there was a grand total of one person who picked german + spanish , and he only did so because he learned english in private lessons , but still , the possibility was there . 
  one foreign language is mandatory ( later two , starting from year 9 , which kids start at 14-15 ) , and most people choose english ( though german is also popular ) , but language education in schools sucks . 
  no one can learn a foreign language in groups of 20 + while only having 2 \u00d7 45 minutes per week for it . 
  but there is pe every day ( even without school gyms , but what does that matter for the government ? 
  ) , so yay . 
  there was a dumb bitch in charge of education a few years back who wanted to push english out in favor of french because english is `` too easy '' ( note that she does n't speak english , and she was a french teacher a long long time ago ) but she was marginalized before she could have realized this plan ( not like there were enough french teachers in the country anyway , but let 's not dwell on practical details , the gov. 
  does n't dwell on that either ) . 
  not like that would have mattered , mind you , for reasons mentioned in the first paragraph . 
  some children , especially in big cities and/or private schools might be lucky enough to get a teacher who actually speaks english and have groups of only 10-15 , so they might get a chance to learn it , but most people who want to learn it just take private lessons or learn it from downloaded movies / series and the internet . 
  i do n't mind his character in team-ups , but i ca n't be bothered to watch his solo movies / pick up the comics . 
  l\u00e1ngos : fried dough topped traditionally with garlic and/or cheese and/or sour cream , though there are plenty of other variations available . 
  no , we 're mostly indifferent about americans in general . 
  the world does n't revolve around you . 
  there could be somewhat more untouched nature . 
  i 've heard good things about canada , europe-like values but a lot fewer people on a bigger area . 
  the us is n't bad either , as long as you 're rich ( and white ) . 
  but currently i think europe hits the perfect balance of individualism and social democracy ( with different parts having different mixes of these , obviously ) . 
  used in hungary too .
