  sometimes combined with a middle finger for the extra oomph . 
  in hungary acs are relatively common . 
  it can get hot enough in the summer . 
  in the netherlands , not so much . 
  last summer there was a week of 30 + temperatures , but that was it . 
  i live in rotterdam , you ca n't get any more ethnically diverse on the mainland . 
  in the area i live it 's frequently easier to count the women * not * wearing a hijab . 
  still perfectly safe . 
  even spangen , charlois , tarwewijk or the afrikanderwijk are n't too bad . 
  i would n't live there because of the burglary statistics , but i felt safe going there even at night . 
  no , but the central square of rotterdam has several belgian flags at half mast right now . 
  the intersections of the grand boulevard of budapest usually have a lamp . 
  it borders some sketchy areas , but it 's pedestrian-friendly . 
  the small boulevard is actually a fairly touristy area . 
  to play video games , mostly . 
  later i branched out to series , movies and books . 
  if you 're just in a country for vacation , no one expects you to learn the local language . 
  ( except maybe the french . ), 
  know the basics ( in hungarian : igen ( yes ) , nem ( no ) , k\u00e9rem ( please ) , k\u00f6sz\u00f6n\u00f6m ( thank you ) , baszd meg ( fuck you ) ) , and you 're set . 
  knowing more hungarian will astonish the locals though . 
  hungary : the former is not too common . 
  the latter is called high school years . 
  the drinkers are n't punished , but stores and pubs that sell the drinks can be . 
  those who live near borders , yeah . 
  though mobile roaming is still a pita . 
  in a related note , `` megbasztam a kurva any\u00e1d '' means `` nice to meet you '' in hungarian . 
  yeah , practicing dutch outside of lessons is extremely difficult . 
  if you guys catch even a whiff of accent , you just switch to english . 
  usually when i 'm picking up my packets from bol , i speak dutch with the ah cashiers ... until they see my id . 
  then they switch to english . 
  i should just lie that i do n't speak english . 
  there is a [ hungarian american football association ] ( http://mafsz.org/ ) , with 20 member teams and 6 other recognized teams . 
  mostly amateurs . 
  there is also a [ hungarian baseball and softball association ] ( http://baseball.hu/en/ ) . 
  28 teams , though some of them are from neighboring countries . 
  also likely amateurs . 
  if you have to live off a local wage , yeah . 
  pretty shitty . 
  but if you have enough money ( say , a w-european wage , or even a top 5 % local wage - even the bottom half of the top 10 % is n't great ) , live in the nicer parts of the capital and somehow manage to ignore the politics , it 's not bad . 
  they are developed countries , so you have proper infrastructure , and basically every product you are used to in the west . 
  i live in the netherlands , and i pin everywhere . 
  the only time i actually * need * cash is when i 'm chipping in for the office lunch . 
  i also use cash when i buy a beer or something like that at a concert , because they usually only have one card reader in the whole bar , and i do n't want to slow the service with that . 
  well , and i carry a handful of 0.5 $ coins for the public toilets and such , but that 's it . 
  europeans should n't have more kids to `` keep the continent european '' ( codeword for white , i assume ) . 
  simply speaking , if we want to raise our kids to have a high niveau of life , we ca n't have 6 of them . 
  the reason we might want to have more children is to avert the demographic-economic crisis that has the following components : 1 . 
  pensioners cost money . 
  even with private retirement funds , their healthcare costs are significantly higher , they frequently get discounts that are then paid by the state , etc. . . and there are countries with no private retirement funds , especially former socialist ones ( because , say , the government fucking stole them in 2011 ... ) . 
  baby boom and echo boom exist in several european countries as well , alongside the slump in the population of gen x and their children . 
  baby boomers are nearing retirement age when they stop being contributors to the state 's budget . 
  however , 1 . children also cost the state ( both direct costs , like creches , kindergartens , schools and healthcare , indirect costs like tax breaks for families with children , and opportunity costs because parents generally work less , thus pay less tax even without the tax breaks ) 2 . children born today wo n't be contributing to the budget until 2040 or so ( by which date the baby boom generation will be dead anyway ) . 
  so this is also a horrible reason to have children , we 're too late with that . 
  if we wanted to avoid the pension crisis , we should have had more children around 1990 , and should have put more weight on private retirement funds . 
  fortunately productivity is constantly increasing and the prices of consumer goods are decreasing , so by the time the echo boomers retire ( the 2030s or so ) , the smaller number of active workers will be able to sustain them . 
  the next 20 years , however , are going to suck big time in this regard . 
  also , africa 's population ca n't , and wo n't grow indefinitely . 
  education and economic development have unfailingly resulted in lower birth rates everywhere in the world . 
  some african countries are fairly developed already , the migration will be largely intra-african . 
   can handle alcohol , not unlike the dutch bwahahaha , teef aub . 
  i have seen what p\u00e1linka does to you guys , both on sziget and when i brought some from hungary . 
  handling alcohol is not exactly your forte . 
  well , it 's one way to keep your psychotherapists and psychiatrists employed ... 
  yeah , many people just bike to the train station , take the train then pick up the bike they keep at their destination . 
  you guys have pretty much perfected multimodal transportation . 
  we just live closer to our workplace . 
  a daily commute of 60 miles in the us is not uncommon , but in europe it 's unheard of . 
  simply speaking , when buying or renting property the proximity to potential workplaces and/or public transportation is valued more than in the us because of the savings involved . 
  even if you live in the outskirts of a big city ( say , budapest ) where you do n't have to be super-rich to afford a house instead of an apartment , you can get to the inner city with public transportation in a reasonable amount of time . 
  currently i live in the netherlands , and i do n't even have a car . 
  everything in the city is within biking distance , and if i have to go to another city , i can just take a train . 
  the network is very dense , and the trains are reasonably accurate and fast ( and i can read while traveling in the train , which is always a plus ) . 
  * ratk\u00f3-children : born in the early to mid '50s during which the weaver-turned-healthcare minister anna ratk\u00f3 banned abortions and enacted a childfree tax . 
  by far the most populous generation . 
  they benefited the most from k\u00e1d\u00e1r 's soft-communism ( [ goulash communism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/goulash_communism ) ) , and consequently were in for a great shock when communism collapsed ( many companies that used a lot of labor were closed , sending lots of them into unemployment ) . 
  their looming retirement ( most of them will be pensioners by 2019 ) is a ticking time bomb as they do n't have private retirement savings for a variety of reasons ^ ^ ^ ^ \\* cough \\* ... ^ ^ ^ orb\u00e1nstoleit ... \\* cough \\* . 
  they are essentially our equivalent of the baby boomers . 
  * ratk\u00f3-grandchildren : a slightly less populous generation ( though currently more populous than the remaining ratk\u00f3-children , thanks to the great hungarian tradition of eating and/or drinking ourselves to death in our fifties ) , the children of the previous generation . 
  basically gen-x . 
  the oldest members of this generation finished high school just when communism fell , the youngest ones have just started it . 
  the movie [ `` moszkva-t\u00e9r '' ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0273840/ ) shows things from their perspective . 
  this generation is the current `` default middle-aged person '' , most of them are employed . 
  * millenials : low population . 
  you might have seen that there was basically no generation between the ratk\u00f3-children and the ratk\u00f3-grandchildren . 
  in the '60s hungary had the lowest birth rate in the world . 
  thus millennials were mostly born to the youngest ratk\u00f3-children ( thus to relatively old parents in the context of the '80s ) and the oldest ratk\u00f3-grandchildren ( relatively young ) . 
  the vast majority of us have no memory of communism , the earliest collective flash memory of this generation is [ the interruption of duck tales in 1993 to announce the prime minister 's death ] ( https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/a_kacsames%c3%a9k_megszak%c3%adt%c3%a1sa ) . 
  there is actually quite a sharp divide in the perception of those born before 1990 and those born after . 
  i tend to attribute this to the sudden availability of western books about parenting , but my guess is as good as anyone 's . 
  i always joke that when i 'm fed up with europe , i 'll move there ( as i ca n't move any further away while staying on the same celestial body ) . 
  other than that , not too much . 
  maybe the wildlife is somewhat less lethal than australia 's ? 
  oh , and i was disappointed that the winning flag design was n't the fractal-kiwi . 
  no , my government goes against pretty much everything i stand for , and they completely ignore the ~ 73 % of people ( or the 55 % of voters ) who did n't vote for them . 
  ok , sometimes they throw a bone to far-righters just so they could take some votes from jobbik . 
  and it 's not fair to say they ignore us , we 're frequently the enemies in their rhetoric ( the evil un-hungarian treacherous liberals ) . 
  our democracy does n't work . 
  just one symptom : they could get a supermajority ( that is , 2/3 of the parliament , allowing them to do anything ) with only 45 % of the votes . 
  when they redesigned the voting system for 2014 they essentially maximized the spoiler effect , knowing that the left is splintered . 
  ( and i 'm pretty sure they are behind one of the `` left '' parties who refused to enter an alliance with the others . ),
