  a bit late , if you ask me . 
  we ( hungary ) have one of our biggest national holiday on the 20th , with fireworks and stuff . 
  * olympic medals / capita * nobel-winners / capita * porn stars / capita * water polo, 
  yeah , best theories put their origin to n-india but they have been separated for long enough to show some different characteristics . 
  i probably would n't mistake a romani for an indian but that 's simply because i have been exposed to both groups enough to tell the difference ( worst ghetto of budapest , vs. technical university , no points for guessing which group i 've seen where ) . 
  budapest : wine , there will be plenty . 
  they range from dry red ( for example , bikav\u00e9r , `` bull 's blood '' ) to sweet white ( asz\u00fa ) . 
  as others said , thermal baths are plentiful , you should visit them . 
  in the uk they can blend in easier , the romani look similar to indians and afaik your gypsies are mostly not romani anyway . 
  in some countries though they are the only significant dark-skinned minority , in hungary for example only the brightest-skinned romani would be able to blend in . 
  he 's a. . . how would they say it ... huge wanker . 
  it 's always so cute when dutch people are complaining about the local bureaucracy ( i study and live in maastricht ) . 
  try hungarian bureaucracy for a while , you 'll be happy to be back to the dutch `` slow chaos '' . 
  ## hungary : a little primer : * elementary school starts at 6 years ( used to be 6 or 7 at the kindergarten teachers ' discretion ) . 
  * there are several possible tracks : * 8 years elementary , 4 years `` gimn\u00e1zium '' ( high school , the higher level secondary institution ) * 8 years elementary , 4-5 years secondary school ( lower level ) * 6 years elementary , 6 years `` gimn\u00e1zium '' * 4 years elementary , 8 years `` gimn\u00e1zium '' ( fairly rare ) * 12 years in the same school ( extremely rare ) * every `` year '' is divided into classes ( e.g. 
  1/a , 1/b ) . 
  there is very little diffusion between these classes during the whole duration of the education in the same school . 
  some classes are held with a different separation ( pe separated by genders , language classes separated by language , etc. . . ) . 
  * after year 12 there is a graduation exam . 
  university admission is based on the graduation exam scores , the grades from the last two years of at most two subjects required by the university and bonus points for doing advanced-level graduation exams from those subjects , language exams , sport achievements , etc. . . #primary , secondary ** good : ** umm ... some schools have nice buildings ? 
  ** used to be good ... ish ** when i went to school teachers had a pretty large level of autonomy . 
  they could pick the textbooks , the pace of the courses , etc. . . 
  in some cases this meant that the good teachers were n't hampered by the red tape and really could excel . 
  but there was n't any quality control so there was an equal number of sadistic teachers utterly hating kids or incompetent teachers ( especially a lot of teachers who were retrained in 1990 from teaching russian to teaching english during a summer course ) . 
  if there were too much complaints about a teacher , the principal or the vice principal sat in on one of the classes . 
  then the teacher in question would clean up his/her act for that one class then punish the whole class afterwards . 
  now this is gone , the incompetent teachers remained but even the competent teachers have to pick one of the two available textbooks ( corruption happened , some friend of the government had a printing company ) and ca n't teach in their own way . 
  ** bad : ** * prussian-style education : lots of lexical data instead of the more modern competence-based approach . 
  when i went to school this was the teaching method of the shittier teachers . 
  now it 's state policy . 
  * no money . 
  this leads to an utter contraselection : while ~ 10 % of the new teachers are extremely passionate about it , teaching programmes on the universities have the lowest admittance requirements , so the other 90 % are the ones who could n't get into any other programme . 
  * in my high school they generally tried to pick one class in every year and assign the more enthusiastic teachers and the better students to that class . 
  fortunately this was my class , as a result every `` student of the year '' was from my class . 
  * also , because of `` no money '' students had to supply things like paper , * toilet paper * , money for chalks , etc. . . 
  in some schools students and teachers were wearing their coats in the winter because there was no money for heating . 
  * between 2002 and 2010 the liberal and socialist education ministers were trying to move the education towards a more modern approach . 
  of course this introduced lots of other issues ( effectively no-child-left-behind in the first four years , meaning that some kids managed to get to year 5 without being able to read fluently ) . 
  then from 2010 the state secretary of education , [ the love child of dolores umbridge and austin powers ] ( http://m.cdn.blog.hu/te/tenytar/image/4953340_159d2a7250245c16e24df6857ffe4d86_wm.jpg ) , r\u00f3zsa hoffman ( from the `` christian democratic people 's party '' ) started moving the system back to the prussian style undoing everything good that came from the socialist-liberal approach and introducing a bunch of other christian-conservative bullshit . 
  like mandatory religion or ethics class ( with the ethics being heavily biased towards conservative ethics ) from year 1 , reducing the amount of informatics classes , wiping out teachers ' autonomy , etc. . . - it will take a whole generation to undo the damage she did . 
  #tertiary education ** good : ** * again , nice buildings ? 
  * university professors have a larger autonomy . 
  of course some are simply bad and should n't teach anyone but others are good . 
  * if you had enough points , you do n't have to pay tuition fees . 
  for some programmes . 
  ** bad : ** * however , if you had a bad day when you wrote the graduation exam , it does n't matter how well you perform , you will have to pay tuition . 
  * it used to be different , determined by the university . 
  at my university the bottom 15 % of the state-financed students was eligible for moving to the self-financed ( assuming they had a weighted average below 2.0 ) and the top 15 % of the self-financed could fill their seats . 
  * tuition fees are only a small part . 
  you have to pay for resits , failed credits , textbooks ( some teachers omit stuff on purpose to force the students to buy the books they wrote ) and basically everything else . 
  and if you exceed the theoretical duration of your education with more than 2 semesters , you 'll have to pay tuition fees regardless . 
  ( it 's extremely easy to do , for example my bsc was 7 semester long , by failing a class in the fifth one that did n't have a resit semester and that was a requirement for later classes i was already 2 semesters out . ), 
  * [ the budget for education is in freefall . 
  ] ( http://m.cdn.blog.hu/te/tenytar/skins/fresh_frutta_by_tenytar/h.jpg ) ( columns : year , total budget in huf , delta since last year in huf , delta since 2008 in huf , delta since last year % , delta since 2008 % , not adjusted for inflation ) . 
  * the number of state-financed seats per programme is determined by the state , unilaterally . 
  for some programmes ( unimportant programmes , like , say , * law * ) it 's zero . 
   right now , students get some money from the government ( almost enough to pay for the rent ) , and a free public transport subscription . 
  you have to work some hours ( 56 , i think ) per month . 
  which would be ok . 
  but apparently they do n't consider internship as work . 
  and interns do n't have a minimal wage . 
  so if i work 56 hours for minimal wage ( 8.45 / h over 23 ) and earn net $ 350 ( or $ 450 or so with the reduced tax ) , i can get another $ 520 and free travel . 
  on the other hand , if i work 160 hours as an intern for a * gross * wage of $ 350 , i ca n't apply for the studiefinanciering and the free travel . 
  and ca n't really work another 56 hours too . 
  ( however , if your parents have a company here and `` employ '' you for the same hours you could get it ... but that 's just the hungarian upbringing talking , i would n't do that . 
  still bullshit that interns do n't get minimal wage or studiefinanciering . 
  i thought they do n't have minimal wage because they are expected to have studiefinanciering ... ), 
  go bar-hopping in the old jewish district . 
  seriously , that area became pretty much the best entertainment district over the last few years . 
  voice and text is n't as expensive as it used to be . 
  you can just get a pre-paid sim in belgium . 
  as for data , cache the maps in a mcdick 's . 
  and i 'm a little offended that you skip hungary . 
  from the looks of it , mushroom , cream and probably tarragon and other spices . 
  so ... take the difference between , say oregon and miami . 
  then remove the common language . 
  and multiply that by ten or so . 
  that 's the difference between two european cultures on average . 
  the only thing i could say for pretty much every european culture is that ( at least below 30 or so ) not having a car is not a deal breaker . 
   furthermore , one needs to look at the economies of germany and the scandinavian countries to see countries with high tax rates that are doing well and often referred to as the `` new economies '' . 
  who 's right ? 
  this is not so general . 
  hungary has one of the highest rates of redistribution ( = taxes , though the straight-up income tax is relatively low ) , yet our economy only showed * some * growth because 2013 was a sunny year . 
  taxation increases the cost of labour . 
  meaning that countries with economies built around labour-intensive industries should probably have lower taxes . 
  also , most scandinavian countries have progressive taxes . 
  it ties into the above because jobs in labour-intensive industries tend to pay less and hiring someone for such a job generates less profit for the companies . 
  so it 's really not as simple as `` high taxes good , low taxes bad '' . 
   how does your countries political system work ? 
  it does n't . 
   if you could , how would you change it ? 
  there are 386 representatives in the parliament . 
  there are 365 days in the year . 
  meaning that we could feed one of them to the lions of the zoo every day . 
  2 or 3 on holidays . 
  getting smashed in the evening . 
  yeah . 
  that 's something you can definitely do here .

  special mention goes to the ruin pubs like szimpla which has managed to become the * best pub in the world * ( according to one touristic magazine anyway ) .
