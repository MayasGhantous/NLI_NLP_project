  and we have the a38 ( not on this map ) which is a fucking boat converted into a concert hall . 
  and which was ranked third on the same scale . 
  just a fair warning , p\u00e1linka will kick your ass . 
  music . 
  some of the places on that map have live music and there are lots of other places , both mainstream and underground . 
  especially in the summer there are several open-air concerts . 
  sights . 
  bunch of old buildings , most of them from the 18th-19th century , some from earlier . 
  and some ( aquincum ) from * much * earlier . 
  cannabis is not legal ( and not especially accepted ) but that has n't stopped anyone from getting high . 
  and this was only budapest . 
  depends on the definition of `` my people '' . 
  the strictest definition that includes more than one person is `` twentysomething emigrant hungarians attempting to get rid of the bad parts of the hungarian mentality and adopting a more european view '' . 
  but i guess that 's not what you 're curious about . 
  when it comes to hungarians , no . 
  he is british . 
  he might have some hungarian influences , but all in all , he is very british . 
  and his age makes it even less likely that he would be considered hungarian by anyone . 
  his grandparents emigrated before wwii and the communist era , the latter leaving an even stronger impression of the hungarian collective psyche than trianon . 
  i do n't think anyone can truly become hungarian . 
  the hungarian psyche is so different from other countries ' that growing up in hungary is the only way . 
  so immigrants - even from other european countries - will never be seen as hungarians . 
  second-generation immigrants maybe , but there is only a few of them and the majority of them are chinese which makes it more difficult . 
  similarly , hungarians will remain hungarians even after spending years in other countries . 
  only third generation hungarians will truly adopt the other culture , second-generation will still have a mix of hungarian and native cultures . 
  currently the coins have either the coat of arms or a plant or animal , alternating . 
  it 's actually a pretty good pattern imo , so it could be transferred to the $ . 
  * no 1 or 2 cents from the start . 
  * 5c : coat of arms * 10c : puli * 20c : coa * 50c : stork * 1 $ : coa * 2 $ : [ saker falcon ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saker_falcon ) special $ - series could be released regularly with one dedicated to nobel-winners ( the winners , if dead , on 2 $ coins , the things they got it for on the 1 $ ones if they can be depicted easily ) , one dedicated to hungarian inventions ( the inventors , if dead , on 2 $ coins , inventions on 1 $ ones ) , etc. . . 
  i would n't really want teller on the coins , i mean he was batshit . 
  neumann , on the other hand ... 
  i do n't think it would be a good idea to reintroduce it . 
  the training is either too short to be actually effective or long enough to cut someone 's career in half . 
  or both . 
  but there are a bunch of people who would be ok with that , mostly middle-aged people who complain about `` today 's youth '' . 
  so if the opposition manages to run a successful campaign , i 'm afraid the government will reintroduce it . 
  p\u00f6tty\u00f6s , see the picture on the wikipedia article . 
  there are some knockoffs ( e.g. 
  danone ) , but they suck . 
  way too sweet for my taste and usually coated in milk chocolate instead of the usual stuff . 
  hungary : [ t\u00far\u00f3 rudi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t%c3%bar%c3%b3_rudi ) every time i go back to hungary i have to bring a bunch . 
  wherever there 's a larger ( few hundred or more ) hungarian expat community there 's a hungarian store that has to import crates of it every week . 
  hungary :  at what age do children normally start going to school ? 
  used to be 6 or 7 , depending on what the kindergarten teachers said . 
  now ( very recently ) it 's mandatory 6 . 
   how long do they stay there ? 
  i 've heard 12 or 13 years of school in different countries . 
  12 is normal , but some schools have an extra year . 
   how is the process split up ? 
  is it elementary -  middle -  high school or is there a different division ? 
  i heard there 's something called college in the uk . 
  there are multiple possible tracks : 1 . 
  elementary for 8 , `` middle school '' or `` gimn\u00e1zium '' for 4 . 
  elementary for 6 , `` gimn\u00e1zium '' for 6 . 
  elementary for 4 , `` gimn\u00e1zium '' for 8 . 
   is education free ? 
  or is it free to some point and then paid ? 
  it 's free , but since the school budgets are tight , there are mandatory donations , most generally called `` oszt\u00e1lyp\u00e9nz '' ( `` class money '' ) . 
   are there both public and private schools ? 
  yes , though public school is the norm . 
   is education obligatory ? 
  if so to what point , to which grade is it obligatory ? 
  yes , used to be until 18 , most recently lowered to 16 . 
   do the pe classes include something like swimming or are they just a class to pass some time ? 
  varies . 
  some schools have contracts with local pools , others do n't . 
  at one of my schools we had swimming , but in the rest it was usually doing the stuff necessary for grading , then playing some ball game . 
   are children obligated to read books and/or do homework during vacation ? 
  yes . 
  they never actually do though . 
   speaking of vacations , what are the vacations like ? 
  at what part of the year and for how long ? 
  * summer break : mid-june to the end of august . 
  * fall break : a week in late october * winter break : ~ december 20 or so to january 3 * spring break : around easter on vacations it 's just `` no school '' . 
   how is the grading system ? 
  1-10 , 2-6 , f-a ? 
  1-5 , 1 = fail . 
  there are some variations : * in-between grades : 1.5 , 2.5 , 3.5 , 4.5 , but usually signified in a way that makes math teachers cry ( 1/2 , 2/3 , 3/4 , 4/5 ) . 
  this does n't make it into the graduation certificate , usually rounded up . 
  generally reserved for people who are legitimately in-between grades ( e.g. 
  the grading was 6-8 points 4 , 9-10 points 5 , and the student somehow acquires 8.5 points ) . 
  * underline grades : generally on the bottom of the points for that grade . 
  does n't make it into the graduation certificate either , it 's just a friendly warning . 
  * 5 \\* : perfect score * 5d : this is the only one that makes it into the certificate , means `` five with honors '' . 
  well , truth to be told \u00c1der is not that interesting , except his eerie similarity to randy marsh and his permanent second place in the `` biggest mustache in the parliament '' competition . 
  head of state = / = head of government . 
  \u00c1der , the head of state is just a signing machine . 
  hungarian : mutyi ( ipa : [ muci ] , `` ty '' is like the first sound in tuesday ) mutyi refers to a specific form of political corruption , when a concession or a procurement is created with the winners already selected beforehand ( when the government is strong these winners are almost always their backers , when it 's weaker it 's usually more balanced between the backers of the stronger parties to shut the opposition up ) . 
  usually attached to the word specifying the type of concession or procurement ( e.g. 
  trafikmutyi - tobacco sales point mutyi , aut\u00f3p\u00e1lyamutyi = highway building mutyi , etc. . . ), 
  well , the years between the hungarians ' arrival to the carpathian basin ( 895-896 ) and the establishment of the state ( 1000 ) were n't exactly peaceful . 
  that part is taught as kind of a heroic age ... but for the other people in europe it was more than likely like a mongolian invasion lite . 
  then for another 500 years or so we were n't more prone to committing atrocities than the average medieval / renaissance european country . 
  the 15th century with king mathias i ( or mathias corvinus ) at the helm for the most part was pretty much a golden age . 
  well , except for the fact that he was a tyrant . 
  on the other hand though the nobles deserved to be put down by a tyrant , the `` black army '' was one of the strongest forces in europe , the royal library became larger than ever , renaissance finally arrived to the country ... and the taxes were higher than ever ... all in all , we learn both the good and the bad about him , but he still remains a positive historical figure . 
  well , then mathias died ( `` and with him the justice '' , as the saying goes ) , the turkish came 30 years later and our nobles demonstrated that if you have a hungarian ally , you do n't need an enemy . 
  pair this up with some ridiculous strategic decisions ( seriously , standing in full armor from dawn awaiting the ottomans ? ), 
  and you get the death of the king , the coronation of a boy king and the start of the turkish conquest . 
  this part is mostly taught as a struggle against overwhelming numbers ( which it was ) and the heroics of the defenders of the fortresses ( which was also kind of true - the turkish had to besiege every single one because they were scattered all around the country and were serious dangers to their supply lines if left unconquered ) .
