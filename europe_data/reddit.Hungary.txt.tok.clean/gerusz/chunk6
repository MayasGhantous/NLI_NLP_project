  it was tarl\u00f3s , somewhere in the wave of street renamings ~ 3-4 years ago . 
  and if both sides fuck up , [ people start drawing dicks onto the ballots ] ( http://szavazzfasszal.blog.hu ) . 
  there 's still the second section outside the keleti ... 
  spotted : a set of perfectly good organs . 
  last week i spent $ 50 in a pub and did n't even get properly drunk . 
  in budapest that money sends me to the toxicology ward even from the most expensive bar . 
  fuck this . 
  huh . 
  i wonder why hungary is so high up . 
  i guess the rural population increases the bike / walk numbers quite a bit . 
  source ? 
  alright ...  we should assemble our gypsies into an army and attack romania . 
  if the army dies , we 'll get hungary back . 
  yeah , we have a similar joke that is far too racist even for this sub . 
  general : [ citation needed ] specific : 1 . 
  how ? 
  ubi would cause a * huge * increase in state expenses , requiring a proportionally huge increase in taxes . 
  which would then be built into the price of products and services , like every other tax . 
  why ? 
  if outsourcing a job is worth it , a company will do it . 
  this will make outsourcing more jobs worthwhile because of the tax hike . 
  wtf ? 
  how would ubi cause more jobs ? 
  4 . who will want extra income so badly ? 
  how so ? 
  more tax -  more inflation -  higher ubi -  more tax ... 6 . 
  why is unconditional better than conditional ? 
  how is it false dilemma ? 
  this is simply examining the alternatives and choosing the better ones . 
  why could n't this be managed by increased unemployment aid , grants that would allow people with necessary skills to become self-employed and programs that let people acquire said skills ? 
  also , what makes you think it would be a small amount of people ? 
  right . 
  then : 1 . 
  what will be the effect of this on the prices ? 
  ( extra tax always causes extra inflation . ), 
  ** what will be the effect of this on the competitiveness of the country 's companies , assuming that , say , china wo n't introduce the same ubi ? 
  what will be the effect of this on jobs ? 
  4 . who will work minimal-wage or near-minimal-wage jobs that ca n't be automated yet ? 
  will ubi follow the inflation ? 
  if yes , will the extra tax caused by this and the inflation caused by the extra tax cause a positive feedback loop resulting in hyperinflation ? 
  if no , what guarantees that ubi will remain a livable income ? 
  why is ubi better than conditional aids ? 
  ( scholarship for students , unemployment for those who apply for x number of jobs , etc. . . ) 7 . 
  would the money spent on ubi have a better place anywhere else ? 
  ( again : conditional aids , educational budget , creating jobs , etc. . . ) 8 . 
  and morally , why should society support those who do n't want to work ? 
  no , not those who ca n't work ( disability , etc. . . ) , not those who ca n't find work , not those who are training themselves : those who could work , could find work but do n't want to find work . 
  no , the question is `` why is it rational ? '' . 
  if i see the proof , i can start dissecting it to show why it is n't . 
  until then it 's assumed to be irrational . 
  also , the real question has two halves : 1 . 
  is ubi rational ? 
  is the eurp 's support for ubi rational ? 
  let 's examine this excerpt from the website to find an answer for # 2 :  although rationalism is what the eurp pushes for , all right ...  one can not be entirely rational on certain issues . 
  not proven . 
   therefore , we must base our morals on something . 
  not proven either . 
   some have resorted to religion and others have resorted to ideology . 
  ok , this is a proven fact . 
   we base our morals on humanism . 
  which is an ideology . 
  unless you can show a rational proof that humanism is better than any possible moral framework or that it is at least better than any other existing framework , choosing humanism is n't rational . 
  thus it is shown that either the eurp supports ubi for irrational reasons or they have n't linked the rational reasons which is just as bad . 
  for question # 1 : prove that ubi on a multinational or even on a national level would have more positive consequences than the alternatives , for example leaving the money at the taxpayers , spending it on education or supporting small businesses . 
  my reasoning for why ubi is * not * the best alternative : ** where does the money come from ? 
  it was nice until the `` basic income '' bit . 
  that is not very rational . 
  even they admit it . 
  but dammit , if your party claims to be rational and ideology-free ( except for rationalism ) then * fucking stick to it !, 
  finally , a country with realistic views on hungary . 
  i guess it 's because santa arrives on the 6th of december ? 
  though in that case it should be there for the netherlands as well ( i know , sinterklaas = / = santa claus , but close enough ) . 
  even in representative democracies . 
  it 's easy to fuck up the future of the country for decades based on the authorization they got 2-3 years ago , sometimes from only a relative majority ( which translates to an absolute majority in systems with significant first-past-the-goalpost elements ) . 
  i think the worst part is that this was decided with only 50.3 % yes . 
  imo votes about international treaties with long-term consequences should have a 2/3 limit . 
  mostly hype . 
  there are a billion problems in the country but for some reason only antisemitism is mentioned in the western media . 
  if i was prone to believe in conspiracy theories , `` western media painting hungarians as nazis so western countries could have an excuse for not bailing out the country '' would be one that i would hold as `` not completely bullshit '' . 
  but it 's more likely that mentioning antisemitism gets more clicks than economic problems , corruption , etc. . . jobbik is popular because they are one of the only parties that have n't been in the government yet ( and neither was their membership ) . 
  a large part of their voting base is made up of people who are disappointed in both the current government and the left-wing opposition and simply vote on them because they have n't fucked up yet . 
  the only way jobbik could get to the government is if the current left-wing opposition runs a strong enough campaign to get ~ 30 % of the seats , leaving fidesz without a 2/3 unless they step into a coalition with either jobbik or lmp . 
  if fidesz ca n't get 2/3 even with jobbik , they wo n't have a coalition because they can lose more voters in 2018 with that step . 
  regardless , fidesz will just shift their rhetoric to a bit further right after the next election to capture jobbik 's voters because between 2014 and 2018 the left-wing will have time to organize and the new voting system heavily favors the largest voting block . 
  hungary : * the government * the opposition * the people who keep electing them also , secondary problems caused by them : ** corruption ** on seriously epic proportions . 
  ** seriously fucked-up priorities ** - the government is building / renovating stadiums because football is orb\u00e1n 's favorite sport . 
  meanwhile education budget gets slashed , teachers ' wages drop and the economy in general is in shambles . 
  ** forced centralization ** of everything possible . 
  except the local governments . 
  for some reason hungary has 3200 local governments + 19 county-level governments for < 10m people . 
  `` some reason '' being that these local governments are stuffed with fidesz-politicians . 
  ** mutyi ** which is a special kind of corruption . 
  the basic process is : 1 . 
  create a new concession or force a renewal of some old concession with some law change 2 . 
  judge the concession tenders completely opaquely 3 . 
  announce government-related people / corporations as winners ** holy cow syndrome ** : pensioners are the biggest voting group . 
  they are also completely dependent on the state . 
  there are only four things that are sure in hungary : death , taxes , an increase of ( nominal ) pensions over the ( nominal ) inflation and an increase of taxes . 
  additionally , young people are either disillusioned in both parties and do n't vote or vote for jobbik anyway . 
  so every other party feels free to shit on them ( us ) .
