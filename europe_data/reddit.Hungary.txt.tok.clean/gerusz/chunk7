  ** state capture ** : personalized laws are a regular occurrence . 
  ** no future ** : lots of us are moving abroad . 
  according to conservative estimates there are 500.000 or so hungarians working abroad , which is ~ 20 % of the people working in hungary . 
  and not only young people , plenty of people in their 40s or 50s are moving . 
  ** forced ideology ** : the christian democrats believe they are a real party . 
  thus they try to force their ideology everywhere where they have any power . 
  : public education - recently teaching religion or ethics became mandatory . 
  and the books they have to teach ethics from are also approved by them . 
  thus there is no way a child can avoid their brainwashing . 
  oh , and these religion classes ? 
  well , sometimes they are showing videos graphically depicting the torture in hell to first graders . 
  i fucking wish i was making this up . 
  ** media manipulation ** on levels even the actual commies would approve . 
  ** taxes ** : highest vat in the world . 
  the redistribution is 52 % . 
  third-world wages , first-world prices . 
  ** no alternatives ** : the current government was supposed to be the chosen one . 
  the only parties are these , the ones that were so bad that the current ones got a landslide victory and the nazis . 
  and tons of other issues . 
  and for the countries without $ the import/export ratio can heavily influence the exchange rates . 
  [ hungarian team ] ( http://www.mob.hu/hirek-szocsi/szocsi-2014-megkezdodott-a-forma-es-sportruhazat-probaja-es-atvetele ) i have to say it 's damn boring , but it 's not like we were actually contenders in any event . 
  y' know , not having hills and money and stuff . 
  well , * that * is surely going to calm things down ... 
  already done , that 's an amazing shop . 
  well , i moved to maastricht . 
  you 're welcome , netherlands !, 
  replacing the bulbs is unfortunately not enough - while a modern light bulb has a much lower energy consumption , the fixture has to be replaced to prevent light pollution . 
  and banning incandescent light bulbs was done for energy-saving reasons . 
  but you know what ? 
  i really hope that i 'm wrong . 
  we can do this in our homes , yes . 
  but replacing street lights costs money . 
  turning off , or even reducing lighting of monuments * might * decrease income from tourism . 
  simply speaking , this is not a priority for decision-makers . 
  and not enough people care about it . 
  yes , i might have overstated . 
  but even living just outside a major city makes higher magnitude stars ( above 3-4 ) invisible . 
  the sky has a constant red glow like it was a perpetual sunset going on . 
  i do n't even remember the last time i 've seen the disk of the milky way , for example . 
  street lights are n't only for drivers though . 
  the solution would be a replacement of every street light with directional lighting , but it costs money and even i agree that this is a fairly low-priority problem . 
  on a related note , here is a zoomable high-res 2012 map : http://www.blue-marble.de/nightlights/2012, 
  we 'll be the last european generation to see the stars . 
  sad . 
  elections : limit is 5 % for parties with their own lists , n * 5 % for alliances with n members . 
  the whole system is complicated as fuck with individual districts , county lists and a national lists . 
  oh , and some `` fragment votes '' calculated from the lost votes in the individual districts . 
  the balance was recently shifted towards individual districts because it favors the largest voting block ( as in : fidesz , the governing party ) . 
  also , previously there were two turns , if no individual candidate got 50 % +1 votes in the first round then the voting for the individual candidates was repeated two weeks later with a first-past-the-goalpost system . 
  in the two weeks candidates could resign , making party alliances between the two rounds possible . 
  now it 's only one round , first-past-the-goalpost for individual districts . 
  money : there 's some kind of an official spending limit , but no one gives a fuck . 
  it 's financed by oligarchs . 
  also , the governments usually buy tons of billboards to advertise their `` successes '' - from public money . 
   even ` murica restricts freedom of speech for libel and slander . 
  libel and slander are objectively false statements . 
  also , it 's generally a civil not a criminal matter - in fact , the un commission of human rights ruled that criminalization of libel and slander violates freedom of expresion .

  also , in the us especially because of the first amendment ( freedom of speech ) the burden of proof is on the plaintiff , as in : the accuser must prove that the statement was factually false . 
  hate speech is subjective * and * a criminal offense . 
  that is a huge difference .

  i 'm working and studying in the netherlands . 
  no visa needed , no working permit needed , none of that bullshit . 
  i also get charged only $ 1800/year at the university instead of the $ 12000 they charge to non-eu citizens . 
  and once i 'm done here , i can just move to pretty much anywhere in the eu where i find a job . 
  ok , i might have to learn the language if i 'm moving to somewhere in scandinavia , france or italy but that 's it . 
  i hope that at least this `` free movement of goods , services and people '' will be extended to most first-world countries in my lifetime . 
  this fucking article again ? 
  the building is nice , the contents not so much . 
  budapest has no single skyline , it being a fusion of two topographically different cities . 
  [ here 's a skyline of buda ] ( http://500px.com/photo/9152736 ) [ and here 's one of pest ] ( http://galerie.chip.de/k/reisen-architektur/europa/budapest_bei_nacht_ii/940282/ ) ( actually shot from the left corner of the buda skyline . 
  probably . ), 
  [ here 's a full panorama , though you have to be filthy rich to actually get this skyline from your bedroom window ] ( http://airsteve.deviantart.com/art/budapest-panorama-402758646 ) ( ok , filthy rich from a hungarian perspective , you can get a house near where it was shot for $ 250k ), 
  holy shit , netherlands ... ok , hot single dutch girls , please form an orderly queue and take a number !, 
  well , they are pretty good at chasing away unemployed people to w-europe . 
  i 'm not sure that it was intentional though ... 
  immigrants and bankers most likely . 
  if anything , this should prove that finns and hungarians are related . 
  as someone reading the baroque cycle it was interesting to see the stuff described there visualized . 
  oh , we have jew jokes as well , do n't worry . 
  it 's just that the jews are portrayed as greedy and cheap while the scottish are portrayed as unreasonably frugal . 
  example :  how do you recognize a scottish house ? 
  the toilet paper is hung out to dry . 
  or  two football players ( soccer for y' all ) are talking :  who are the most cultured audience in the world ? 
   the scottish . 
   why ? 
   because they sure as hell do n't throw anything onto the field . 
  or  a scotsman asks his neighbor :  what did you do last night ? 
  i saw your light going off for a second every minute . 
   well , i was reading and i realized that i can turn the page in the dark too . 
  -- vs. the jewish jokes :  a jewish kid attends to a catholic school . 
  the teacher says : `` i give 1000 forints ( ~ $ 3.3 or so ) if you tell me who was the greatest man in the world . '', 
   one kid says : leonardo da vinci  teacher : well , he was a great man but i did n't think of him , sorry . 
   another says : einstein  teacher : better , but still not him . 
   jewish kid says : jesus  teacher : good , here 's the 1000 . 
  but you 're jewish , should n't you have said moses ? 
   jewish kid : well , moses is moses , but business is business ... ( well , this was as politically correct as possible ... ) or  during genesis , god asks the races about the noses they want . 
  he asks the blacks :  well , we want a wide one . 
   and they got it .
