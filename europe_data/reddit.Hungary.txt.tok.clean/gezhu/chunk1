  that picture is about people supporting ideas they have nothing to do with . 
  some families are too serious about politics , teaching hatred to their children . 
  well this is my interpretation , maybe the author could tell more about it . 
  ** hungary ** arc , the yearly ` street art ' exhibition has ended . 
  most notable topics are the emigartion and orb\u00e1n 's government . 
  sadly arc has ran out of sponsors , due its government critical aspect , so next exhibition is expected to be founded by donations . 
  the main problem is the lack of flats right ? 
  my friend wanted to buy one but could n't find any good around m\u00fcnchen . 
  buda is where the picture was taken , and the other side of danube is pest .

  there are about 10-12 spieces , like lemur catta , panthera tigris , panthera leo , etc. 
  https://www.facebook.com/maganzoo < pics . 
  in the beginning , the owner somehow managed to get some regular lion cubs , and raised them really close to humans , so they act like big cats . 
  actually its a problem , because mungo the male lion _ ca n't _ make the female pregnant . 
  < nsfw  the female lies back then comes the male and well ... ca n't aim properly , so the female gets bored and the woohoo is over . 
  < / nsfw  the guy then traded his lions to other animals with international zoos , so he got his animals . 
  i pretty much respect that guy , building a zoo from nothing requires much endurance . 
   robber posed as buyer and stole $ 13000 [ 18 ] worth caracal [ 19 ] kitten from its owner under gun point . 
  caracal kittens are serious business . 
  a pair of white lion cubs worth ~ $ 21000 , so yep , kittens are serious business . 
  ( source : my coworker is volunteer at a zoo ), 
  well , it 's not uncommon that the site/house is divided , and a half is for parents , and the other half is for their children . 
  for example , my grandma and my uncle still sharing the same house , or my exgf 's family is doing the same . 
  our verison of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ingsoc, 
  well , its understandable , the current trend is women with beard . 
  34,5 % of my income is ~ ~ going for building hunsoc ~ ~ taken by the state .

  i think it 's a bit more than money . 
  [ t\u00f6r\u00f6k g\u00e1bor ] ( http://torokgaborelemez.blog.hu/ ) writes pretty interesting articles about the situation , in an analyst way , for example , [ the nuclear plant story ] ( http://torokgaborelemez.blog.hu/2014/01/19/505_atom_es_hatalom ) . 
  it 's an extreme case , is n't it ? 
  i usually greet women with a kiss on each cheek . 
  sometimes i touch one of their upper arm too . 
  ( it helps to synchronise the process ) if i did this at stockholm or at g\u00f6teborg , locals would n't call the police right ?

  sending something into the space is not as easy as it looks like . 
  afaik the transport rocket 's launch of our first satellite ( masat1 ) was cancelled . 
  fortunately , got a spot in another vega rocket at the last minute , otherwise it would be delayed by months or so . 
  maybe , they did n't want to wait that much . 
  ( [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lituanica_sat-1 ) writes about reschedule ) congratulations btw !, 
  fun fact : there 's an [ android app about masat ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hu.rtmsoftware.masat&amp;hl=hu ), 
  i wonder what the dealers do with 140 kg of banana :d, 
  i wonder if we could make a socially awkward party . 
  my first thoughts : [ tankcsapda - be vagyok r\u00fagva ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhvfdu7ie34 ) - aka * i 'm drunk * - this song was so popular here , university students [ rewrote a bit , and animated on a dormitory 's wall ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfqndjydi9o ) . 
  after this , it became the hymn of the yearly student competition . 
  * [ quimby - aut\u00f3 egy szerpentinen ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_w_xgt7qdw ) - aka * car on a serpentine * - many of us love quimby , those melancholyc songs are truly amazing . 
  * edit : [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g3onxmipug ) is the original of the rewroted song , i was tired a bit ... 
  i belive our nationalistic ideas came up after wwi , and that time the right-wings were in government . 
  during the communist years , nationalism was not supported because of this . 
  in recent years : fidesz - ruling party lead by orb\u00e1n - defines itself as an anti-communist party , so if communists do n't support nationalism , then they do , and jobbik has to overbid it to get voters . 
  they became strong after a catastrophic left-winged government , because people thought they would do better . 
  btw , quoting vernazza from the last weekly report :  orb\u00e1n is practicing to be the lovechild of lukashenko and kim jong-un and the goverment announced plans for state monopoly in the following fields : textbooks ( printing , writing , etc. ), 
  ... * sigh *, 
  i think you can teach history without glorifying your own nation , but lack of scepticism is definitely destructive . 
  i agree , making obligatory the world history would teach some kind of scepticism , but imporved math , or physics subjects would do the same . 
  i 'd imporve teaching of natural science first because it 's one of the weakest point of our education system . 
  for the average student , probably not . 
  then i 'd split the subject to world history and national history , and only national would be obligatory . 
  so little geeks would be satisfied too  ( though , our education system has bigger problems than this ), 
  i think history subjects are focusing the relevant actions in your nation 's view . 
  for example , hungarians learn about the heterogenous population of austro-hungary and that it was a problem , but no more details . 
  i was a bit surprised that slovaks hate kossuth that much - according to wdl about austria thread - . 
  we learnt the debate between kossuth and sz\u00e9chenyi , some reforms , etc. 
  but textbooks refer him as a great politician rather than a hardcore nationalist . 
  we missed some very interesting parts too : no aztecs , no eric the red , no jeanne d\u2019arc , teutonic knights , longbowmen , etc. 
  and that time i was age of empires ii addicted . 
  bucharest and budapest would be in the same country . 
   people vote to ban your right to equality bread and butter of the extremist parties in general , it 's not ee specific . 
  [ jobbik ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jobbik ) - party that engenders hate groups - is popular in rural areas , because of gypsy conflicts . 
  budapest : last semester , our computer graphics lesson was delayed by ~ 30 minutes because the professor had tried to drive . 
  ( persuaded by his wife ) unfortunetly he started before the rush hour , ended up parking halfway to the campus and coming by foot . 
  his advice was not to listen to women . 
  so , it 's kind of accepted fact , that rush hours should be avoided or face with significant waiting time .

  i feel the same . 
  the purpose of the linked image ( and that exhibition ) is to open those nationalists ' eyes . 
  sadly they are n't really interested in anything different from their views . 
  anyway , i 'm trying to make them thinking about their beliefs with pictures like that .
