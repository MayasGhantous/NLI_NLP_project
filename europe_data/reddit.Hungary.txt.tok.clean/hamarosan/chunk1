[ but not unheard of . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poisoning_of_alexander_litvinenko ), 
  yeah , the kurds are somewhat secular but they are also very racists . 
  the war is nowhere near to the end and they 're already having skirmishes with other ( supposedly allied ) groups . 
  mark my words , they will cause a lot of trouble in the future . 
  and you should read a little more before you start talking out of your ass . 
  look up some of the cities in eastern europe or japan after ww2 . 
  the bombings literally leveled major cities and towns and displaced tens of millions of people . 
  but they rebuilt it . 
  this is complete bs . 
  there are no secular , democratic rebel groups in syria . 
  like it or not , the most secular force there is the regime . 
  but let 's not forget the infamous [ havanna ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/havanna_ltcivertanlegi.jpg ) or just any [ random part ] ( http://www.legifoto.com/files/gazdagret.jpg ) of budapest , really . 
  or more like [ any random part ] ( http://www.zoldjovo.eu/sites/default/files/images/zj_201208_lakotelep.jpg ) of the [ country ] ( https://szantograf.hu/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/avas_reszlet_353970_57619-800x415.jpg ) . 
  i used to work in london in a cheap hotel and we would regularly have people come in , make a reservation for their `` brother/sister/uncle / aunt/former owner of their dog/etc ... '' pay for it , get the invoice just to never be seen or heard from again . 
  they just needed the invoice to get the visa . 
  there 's no ` gy ' sound in ` immediately ' . 
  in fact , they need the price of a barrel of oil to be more than double of the current price for them to not be losing money . 
  we had the same debate in hungary . 
  they enforce the law and the bars are doing just fine . 
  the eu is neither a country nor a federation ( yet ? ) . 
  the us can and do impose different visa requirements on member countries . 
  edit : grammar for clarity, 
  born and raised in a devout christian family . 
  i was an altar boy for 8 years and i was seriously planning to become a priest . 
  but i just ca n't stand organized church anymore . 
  i ca n't say i 'm religious and i ca n't say i 'm an atheist . 
  let 's just say that i keep an open mind and i 'll wait to see what happens when i 'm dead . 
  i do n't . 
  your actions speak for themselves . 
  no , you do n't . 
  you have closer ties to the us than to any other country on the planet . 
  and that 's your doing not europe 's . 
   from european partners when was the last time a british thought about mainland europe as partner ? 
  they are n't buying combat drones . 
  they are buying survaillence uavs . 
  or they can buy a few that were actually made for what they need it . 
  i mean , when a friend tells me they want to buy a car , the first thing that comes to my mind is not a rocket car . 
  it was n't but the process had already started at the time of his assassination . 
  something would 've happened either way . 
  what ? 
  saying that a devastating war that crippled half of europe was the better option is just insane . 
  there was a strong push for greater autonomy not only from the oppresed ethnicities but from the ruling intellectuals too . 
  [ franz ferdinand was planning to federalize the empire . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_of_greater_austria ), 
  is n't a system like this already in place ? 
  with some countries are part of the common market and/or schengen but are not eu members . 
  we either move in the direction of a european federation or we can just forget the idea of the eu and keep the common market . 
  we ca n't have fully sovereign states and a functioning union at the same time . 
  it 's time to make our choice . 
   at the point where you commit to provocative action you should abandon any expectation of what you think is reasonable response . 
  well , then this entire conversation is moot . 
  just do whatever you want . 
   moreover nato possesses aerial capabilities that russia could not detect/intercept . 
  how do you know that ? 
  the entire nato dropped their jaw when the russians entered the syrian civil war . 
  the british jets did n't have to `` perform several passes '' for that . 
  they were escorting a helicopter . 
  also note that they were aware of the fact that the russian aircraft was unarmed . 
  because your model has worked out very well , has n't it ? 
  it 's an actual hungarian artifact you can see it in a museum in j\u00e1szber\u00e9ny , hungary . 
  unique . 
  even you link points to a wikipedia picture of a [ hungarian myth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lehel#the_lehel.27s_horn_myth ) . 
  that 's because , apparently , you do n't understand cultural identity . 
  eastern europe is most certainly not just a geographical term . 
  yes , that was kind of the point of my comment . 
  because most redditors read the headlines , make a short comment and then move on to the next post . 
   kurdish groups are fighting isis but have also committed atrocities against the turkish state . 
  it 's even more complicated than that . 
  some groups fight isis some do n't . 
  some work directly with the us some with iraqi forces . 
  they also work with the rebels who are just as extreme as isis . 
  and so on . 
  there is n't a clear cut line between the good and the bad guys . 
  they lost $ 60 billion just by themselves . 
  no sanctions or anything . 
  from your own link :  they peaked at $ 737 billion in august of 2014 . 
  in may of this year , they were down to $ 672 billion . 
  they lost over $ 60 billion in less than a year . 
  if the west took this matter seriously they could do a lot about it . 
  `` that part of europe '' is also the only part where there are n't any getthos choke full of `` refugees '' and 2nd and 3rd generation immigrants . 
  that article is irrelevant here . 
  hollande has declared state of emergency so the police has all the rights they want ( terms and conditions may apply ) . 
  no , they would send [ the cunt ] ( http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/52bdbf7e69bedd9a38ce32ea/a-2-minute-guide-to-the-crisis-in-turkey-that-sent-markets-tanking-and-put-the-government-in-its-weakest-position-yet.jpg ) . 
  might have been the arrest of [ carlos the jackal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carlos_the_jackal ) . 
  weel , the [ whois does n't give you much information ] ( http://i.imgur.com/khiznbx.jpg ) except for an email address : bilgi@sendika.org and a turkish phone number : +90-312-111111 . 
  the whois lookup for [sendika.org also wo n't help ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ozork9m.jpg ) because it is protected by contact provacy inc. and was registered by tucows inc. which is just a domain reseller . 
  i ca n't continue as i 'm at work but this really does n't look like a genuine company . 
  you do n't get what i mean , do you ? 
  and now willing to pay 100 % of the 21 billion . 
  is this the same germany that was bitching about bailing out greece ? 
  an expat is somebody who lives outside their country ( temporarily or permanently ) . 
  there 's no real difference between the two words . 
  are you really looking for an argument just so you can piss on a man 's grave who has just died ? 
   turkey certainly ca n't http://www.businessinsider.com/turkey-is-building-a-wall-along-its-border-to-keep-out-isis-militants-2015-7, 
   as long that 's the thing . 
  you never know how long it will last . 
  probably the people who kept their money there before the swiss let the americans peek into the swift system thought it was fine too . 
   any british person who has n't lived in the uk in the last 15 years currently can not register to vote in elections and referendums . 
  i just love british humour .
