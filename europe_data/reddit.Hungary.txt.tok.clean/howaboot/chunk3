  here 's my brief theory . 
  despite the differences in population and their linearly proportional talent pools , the number of people `` going pro '' is a sub-linear function of the population , much closer to being constant than proportional . 
  since there 's only so many medals to offer in national junior competitions , kids who never win anything quit , and you 're left with a rather fixed number of kids who had some sort of success , regardless of your population . 
  then you have to rely on this smaller number of kids to train hard , develop well and become olympians . 
  of course bigger countries have better starting material to work with because the kids had to clear higher standards to stay in sports , but their numbers are n't all that much higher than those in smaller countries . 
  and how much they improve on top of their junior performance is somewhat random . 
  i think there might be some interesting math in there by the way , extreme value theory and stuff . 
  i think i could build a model that is n't complete bollocks and reflects the above factors . 
  like : 1 . 
  take a normal distribution for innate talent for some sport . 
  generate n `` kids '' where n is your youngster population , and take the best 50 . 
  add another smaller normally distributed random value to these 50 reflecting their junior-to-adult improvement . 
  take the best 3 . 
  these go to the olympics . 
  add another even smaller random value to these 3 reflecting their form at the olympics . 
  do this for other countries with different population . 
  give medals for the top three overall . 
  repeat many times for many sports and plot the number of medals against population . 
  you 'd get a curve that grows slower than the population , much like a square root function . 
  i once did an analysis between population vs medal count among countries that take the olympics seriously enough to get more than x medals every time . 
  and i found that medals vs. square root of population fits the data best . 
  then i applied that formula for every participating country with the really tiny ones included , and britain has won this year . 
  you could go even lower with uk , italy , hungary and still be # 1 with 27 ( vs 26 for usa right now ) . 
  his whole point is that these `` facts '' were calculated brainlessly even with the state falsification aside . 
  you ca n't apply ppp to a planned economy the same way you do for a market economy . 
  it does n't matter what the prices of a car/phone/food were set to because you could n't buy them . 
  but it 's not a building ... 
  wtf are you on about , it says opera singer xy was killed * at the front line * . 
  do you know what the term front line means ? 
  what do you want , `` killed at the front line , you know that war place where soldiers are fighting with guns and stuff , not civilians '' so retards like you understand it better ? 
  i do n't know if you missed the 2013 ruling or you mean homeless people by `` not everyone '' , but every household has to pay now , whether or not they own a tv or radio . 
  there are no gez spies peeking into your apartment looking for a tv anymore , you just have to pay , period . 
  so that makes it a fixed per-household tax regardless of how you dress it up . 
  he 's a competitor , not a pundit . 
  a sportsman has no business belittling a fair opponent 's mentality , even if his statements would be considered a realistic assessment from a pundit 's mouth . 
  my opinion on this matter is unchangeable . 
  a good sport does n't do it . 
  period . 
  regarding the iceland are n't going to do nuthin stuff , you may well be right and he could have meant iceland are n't going to attack . 
  goal differences in their qualifying group : netherlands +3 , turkey +5 , czech +5 , iceland +11 . 
  first of all , i 'm not a hater , i 've always cheered for cristiano doing well as i 'd been following united for nearly 20 years . 
  and obviously i 'll continue to do so regardless of some mean post-match statements . 
  but let 's call a spade a spade . 
  he was n't `` respectful at all times '' and the media did n't twist his words like your entire post is trying to convince us . 
  he did say `` small mentality '' , right ? 
  he did say iceland are n't going to do anything in the competition , right ? 
  both of these are very disrespectful things to say about an opponent who 's just drawn you fair and square , without playing dirty , without being favored by the ref . 
  ronaldo has played dozens if not hundreds of games like this , his comments are so uncalled for it 's ridiculous . 
  btw , it 's such an odd thing to say that a team ca n't amount to anything playing like this , especially from ronaldo of all people . 
  he should really know better , he was on the pitch in the 2004 final . 
  what a load of shit . 
   iceland did n't try anything . 
  they were just defend , defend , defend and playing on the counterattack . 
  it was a lucky night for them . 
  we should have three points but we are ok . 
  i thought they 'd won the euros the way they celebrated at the end . 
  it was unbelievable . 
  when they do n't try to play and just defend , defend , defend , this in my opinion shows a small mentality and they are not going to do anything in the competition . 
  not far from what americans pay for their gas in total . 
  not computers , but the general [ architecture of modern computers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/von_neumann_architecture ) . 
  it has to do with how data and programs are stored in memory , how they are loaded into and executed by different units of the processor , technical stuff . 
  so not some shiny physical computer . 
  the question was `` how favourable is your view of ... '' for which the vast majority of respondents probably just ticked the box in the middle , hence the 52 % result . 
  i mean , i would probably do the same with latvia , maybe one step towards positive out of eastern european sympathy . 
  estonia is a different story with their high-tech reputation , but i guess it 's not so widely known enough yet . 
  good idea , that 's the only noteworthy region of your country anyway . 
  that 's the happy one with fireworks and a negligible amount of politics compared to the other two .

  it 's one of those natural wonders that in many people seems to elicit an irresistible desire to crank the fuck up every slider they can find in photoshop . 
  half of those pictures are the result of photoshop abuse comparable to the op . 
   in germany its just a `` scheibe brot '' change that first b to that other , funky looking \u00df and we agree . 
  also , you 're not limited to nespresso capsules , lots of manufacturers sell their own compatible capsules at lower prices . 
  most of them are still very good and it 's fun to explore . 
  lmao at finnish not using 4 out of the 7 first letters of the alphabet . 
  i can only imagine the shock the abcdefg song causes in little kids ' first english class . 
  a-what ? - what ? - d-e-what ? - what ? 
  would make a great song on its own though . 
  that 's not a mirror translation , that 's a new word . 
  and surely you could have found a better example than a word that has n't been used by anyone for 50 years because a hungarian word has long displaced it . 
  mere mirror translations do n't count . 
  just because two words have the same logic does n't make them lexically similar if they are a completely different bunch of letters . 
  form has to match too . 
  you would n't say widerstand and ellen\u00e1ll\u00e1s are similar just because they 're built against + stand . 
  i do n't have any particular ngo in mind , you 'd have to do some research . 
  but i think there must be a couple of foundations for facilitating healthcare access . 
  this is n't asking for money randomly , think more of a ( somewhat risky ) loan than a donation . 
  by losing your disability you could enter the workforce and finance your treatment , the ngo would merely help you pay the upfront costs which you 'd subsequently pay back to them . 
  considering that you also have a viable lawsuit , you might be able to find someone who would be willing to take the risk and help you . 
  okay , i get it . 
  sounds like your treatment would be a one time thing ( as opposed to , say , a sustained 1000 eur/month cost until the end of your life ) . 
  which makes it better because it gives you a chance to make that much back by being gainfully employed after your treatment . 
  therefore i would n't be so quick dismissing ngos . 
  a bank will not give you a loan for this but an ngo might . 
  especially if they see a chance that you could sue it back from the insurance institution eventually . 
  what are the costs of the treatment and how much are you losing out on by not being able to work ? 
  i suppose there 's either a large gap between the two or it 's upfront cost heavy . 
  if it 's the latter though , would you be able to repay it if some ngo financed it for you ? 
  there is no `` that land '' , the majority of counties were ethnically separated . 
  the inner , eastern , sz\u00e9kely parts were hungarian , the outer parts romanian , and the oradea - cluj - turda - targu mures corridor mixed . 
  and some germans sprinkled here and there .
