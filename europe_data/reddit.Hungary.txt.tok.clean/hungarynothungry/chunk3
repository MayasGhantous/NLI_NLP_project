  but i suppose it makes sense that a lot more asylum seekers come by land rather than by sea . 
  reddit admins are some of the most irritating admins there are . 
  like when they block / r/watchpeopledie in germany because they have no spine . 
  what a bunch of dipshits , you 'd think this site is run by a bunch of high schoolers in their parents ' basement . 
  or -- this may be completely out there , but bear with me -- we could have _ both _ types of content ? 
  one does n't prevent the other from existing , bringing this up is completely irrelevant . 
  they 're completely mutually exclusive . 
  huh , that many for hungary ? 
  i mean , i knew there were a lot , but i thought italy had more . 
  yeah , russian science fiction is pretty neat . 
  i mean , russia has done more bad than good in the past century and i really dislike them for it , but at least their books are alright . 
  there 's also a lot of shit i get from rutracker , but that 's about where it ends , at least for me . 
  in hungary actually nobody uses `` at '' . 
  it 's always `` kukac '' . 
  i 'm sure there are other countries where that 's the case . 
  check the website op posted , it translates to `` crazy a '' . 
  sooo ... where would we deport them in our case ? 
  yeah , open borders just saved my ass the other day because i ca n't find my damn passport anywhere . 
  unbelievable that some people think closing borders is gon na fix shit . 
  i mean it 'll help , but there are far better solutions . 
  that reminds me , there 's a [ humongous playlist ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plpshjy6oyjm9fd2ytxafkvusckkprffuo ) on youtube filled with hungarian folktales ( most hungarians will probably be familiar with these ) . 
  twist is , they 're in hungarian , so you wo n't understand much if you do n't speak the language . 
  a dead kid is n't exactly what i expected when you wrote nsfw ... might wan na slap a `` dead children '' warning on there somewhere, 
  well they got the `` beak '' - part right . 
  yeah , that 's what i meant by it being too specific . 
  i 'd say poland belongs to that list as well . 
  even americans know who they are . 
  then say ` tike ' while doing it ... 
  it becomes too specific , but at least you 'll definitely be indian . 
  you and latvia were the countries that kept me from getting 100 % on that geography test in 3rd grade . 
  _ shakes fist _ kinda hard to mix them up once you learn about the polish-lithuanian commonwealth though . 
  i do n't think anybody denies it ... 
  there would n't be an insurgency if the east was pro-eu as well . 
  my mom is swiss and at the passport control of an airport they confused switzerland not with sweden , but with swaziland . 
  austria and australia sort of make sense because both are mainly white , but swaziland ... come on . 
  google translate [ translates '' \u0430\u0431\u0432 '' from bulgarian ] ( https://translate.google.com/?source=dict-chrome-ex&amp;sl=bg&amp;tl=en&amp;q=%d0%b0%d0%b1%d0%b2#bg/en/%d0%b0%d0%b1%d0%b2 ) . 
  yeah there was a story a few years ago where the europa league final was played in bucharest and several hundred fans ended up in the wrong city . 
  i 'm genuinely curious , what does the anti-russian side deny ? 
  i 'm not talking about bias , i 'm looking for examples where the west denies facts the same way russia denies it 's involvement in the conflict , for example . 
  heh , i ca n't be the only one who thinks that pun is lame . 
  t. no problem . 
  our austrian neighbours have a pretty badass story about their flag ... let 's just pretend that ours has the same backstory , but instead of the blood of humans it 's the blood of orcs or something . 
  thanks for your contribution , i really mean it , but this sub _ is _ called / r/europe , so it 's not unfounded criticism ... 
  i mean he sort of has a point , even if he comes across as a snob . 
  i personally do n't care , but you said it yourself , this sub is about europe . 
  it 's not like americans chime in with some obscure info , the vast majority of discussion that happens on this website is about them already . 
  sure , it 's interesting , but so are plenty of things that do n't belong here . 
  flairs have nothing to do with this though , no idea why you 're bringing them up . 
  definitely the most unique . 
  i always wanted to have one because i share a name with modric . 
  plus you were the only neighbour that consistently qualified for anything , but maybe that 'll change ( yes , i keep telling that to myself ) . 
  same idea with estonia [ . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/estonian-flag-landscape.jpg ) no idea if that 's true though , i just read it on here a while ago . 
  huh , i suppose swiss german is `` pier '' , but i never thought to spell it with a `` p '' . 
  not enough , i lived in asia for most of my life , so i got ta catch up at some point . 
  hungary - i 'm from here . 
  switzerland - i 'm from here too . 
  pretty much every major city from geneva to st. gallen , not too many places in the alps themselves . 
  france - paris , mulhouse . 
  italy - siena and the tuscany beach , venice . 
  croatia - split . 
  uk - london ( technically , but i was too young to remember ) takes the count to 8 . 
  shit , i have n't been to many places at all . 
  at least an advantage of having been to an international school is getting to know people from a lot of places , so some near-future realistic possibilities include prague ( not too far from here ) , bratislava ( even closer ) , oslo , berlin ( going there this fall if everything goes right ) , ireland ( likely dublin ) , and the uk ( properly this time ) . 
  unrealistic possibilities include everything else . 
  i just got ta get some money together first though . 
  no , funnily enough , they thought i was carrying weed . 
  _ weed _ . 
  who gives a shit about weed ? 
  i mean do you really think i would panick if i had a gram in my pocket and saw a cop ?? 
  and do you know how they greeted me ? 
  you 'd think it 's `` good evening '' , but instead it was `` tell us now if you have weed with you , you 'll be sorry if we find out you were lying . '', 
  there was nothing more satisfying than seeing that peabrained shit lose this battle and fuck off with his friends . 
  same here , and take care not to turn around too hastily in front of them , even if you do n't do it because of them , because they will run after you and ask you to pack out all your stuff while accusing you of carrying drugs , making you miss your last bus home . 
  bunch of mentally challenged bullies with a superiority complex . 
  i was n't aware this is so controversial among you . 
  historical savoy is now part of italy as well , so it 's italian just as much as it is french . 
  the swiss made it their own , and it 's considered swiss around the world , so they win . 
  paprika-based dishes are n't necessarily our invention either , but we 're famous for it , so they 're considered hungarian . 
  r\u00f6sti with apple sauce is the only way to eat it imo . 
  heretic !!, 
  also the creamy version is n't guly\u00e1s , it 's [ p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/p%c3%b6rk%c3%b6lt ) . 
  so you still like hungarian guly\u00e1s more than the austrian one , but you prefer p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt over it . 
  ask a german where fondue is from : `` switzerland '' . 
  an italian : `` switzerland '' . 
  a swiss : `` switzerland '' . 
  a french : `` french-speaking switzerland '' . 
  which part of `` the logic of that specific example '' do n't you understand ? 
  is it the `` specific example '' bit ? 
  because that blurb you posted still does n't answer the question . 
  that 's great , but you did n't answer his question . 
  he 's asking about the logic of that specific example . 
  i guess you 're right in that regard . 
  i was speaking purely grammatically though , as from what i gather from the comment you replied to , `` gwa\u0142t '' has a connotation that `` gewalt '' does n't . 
  as you said , you need to add an adjective for it to change its meaning . 
  nope , in german it 's either `` vergewaltigung '' ( rape ) or `` gewalt '' ( violence ) . 
  the latter does n't mean rape in any context . 
  _ waves cane angrily _, 
  or there are just different people with different opinions on here, 
  i would n't say the government is crazy anti-weed , but it 's not amsterdam .
