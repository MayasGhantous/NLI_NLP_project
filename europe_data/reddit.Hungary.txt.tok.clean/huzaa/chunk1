and the poverty in france . 
  hungary was multiculti , before it was cool . 
  because hungary is a country , not a bridge . 
  i feel you . 
  we need quotas !, 
  for gypsies . 
  i am really laughed loudly on this . 
  why is sweden so nazi ? 
  yes . 
  it 's great to remember that hungarian history is actually an irl game of thrones . 
  wow , they are sealious . 
  at least we have wizzair . 
  i wait until the movie comes out . 
  i heard that this makes it easy to shell budapest without crossing the border . 
  is n't it obvious ? 
  or chemtrail . 
  what is slovakia ? 
  ironic , that you that the shops are now closed on vas\u00e1rnap . 
  unfortunately , skylon will never fly . 
  [ lol ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albert_szent-gy%c3%b6rgyi )  albert szent-gy\u00f6rgyi offered all of his nobel prize money to finland in 1940 . 
  ( the hungarian volunteers in the winter war travelled to fight for the finns after the soviet invasion of finland in 1939 . ), 
  yes , this is the key for our gdp growth . 
  retarded government is retarded . 
  well , but even the really nationalistic hungarians have no problems with croatians or croatia . 
  this is not the case for some of our other neighbors . 
  actually , hungary provided ~ 100 km fence and other tools for macedonia , to build their own controlled border . 
  i guess we can call this european solidarity . 
  exactly . 
  not being pc does n't mean you are a total douchebag . 
  usa also does fucked up stuff ( like supporting al-qaeda and others ) . 
  do n't get me wrong , i am not a us hater . 
  governments do all kinds of fuck up stuff every time . 
  we should n't be biased with the people , that 's all . 
  these guys will have a lot more embassies to work on . 
  ^ like ^ austria ^ slovenia, 
  request asylum in hungary . 
  i wonder , how the polish-hungarian relations would work out . 
  i heard that pis is the polish fidesz , but with strong atlantic commitment and anti-russian attitude . 
  i guess it 's now ( with the migrant crisis ) this would n't matter , but the future is not so clear . 
  now you can rest in pis . 
  sorry , i ca n't remember . 
  yes , of course , but still better than russia . 
  one online newspaper ( index.hu ) made a video , about their two male reporters walking on the streets of budapest hand-in-hand . 
  they got some looks , but nothing really happened . 
  well , as i remember they even got a compliment , how brave they are . 
  maybe that guy was a foreigner . 
  i do n't know what would have happened if they made-out . 
  as far as i know nasa itself does n't built anything . 
  all hardware was created by their contractors , even from the beginning . 
  for example the saturn v engines was created by aerojet rocketdyne , the lunar landers by grumman aircraft and so on . 
  the difference between them and companies like spacex , is that the new contracts use fixed prices with limited control . 
  they are like buying new cars from the car maker , instead of being there and controlling every single design and fabrication step with an unlimitedly growing budget . 
  this is why i mentioned it . 
  the new york times , euronews , cnn also made critical reports this week . 
  i linked these videos specifically , because they were uploaded today . 
  well , in hungary you got free wifi and ac only on intercities ( express trains ) . 
  but thats a higher price category . 
  like everywhere ? 
  so , do you think we ever had the power to solve the problem by ourselves ? 
  because shipping on cockleboats are safe . 
  and then the media will say it 's `` inhumane '' and `` xenophobic '' . 
  that would be really interesting . 
  spreading illiberal democracy in the world , while partying with kurvas . 
  i thought it 's poland . 
  but it seems they think otherwise . 
  so , i guess our best ally is p\u00e1linka and getting drunk to death . 
  or , they just do it online e-stonia style . 
  oh , you will get used to this , do n't worry . 
  you would not get hurt here . 
  not to mention radical romanian terrorist attacks . 
  well , the usa started a global war , because of some skyscrapers ... 
   not all of america is us . 
  i never said this . 
  i referred to the space port in ** south america ** ( french guiana ) , where ariane rockets are launched . 
   a non-us launcher has inherent advantages to many . 
  like what ? 
  you still have to ship your payload to america . 
   also , lets see falcon heavy deliver something to gto before saying it will be replacing anything . 
  ariane 6 also did not take anything to anywhere . 
  fh maiden flight is still closer , with the 2017 q1/q2 dates , than ariane 's 2020 . 
  quite unfortunate . 
  after spacex 's falcon heavy no one will want an ariane 6 . 
  \u0150\u0151\u0151 . 
  you mean szalonna ? 
  certainly , not us . 
  `` close your eyes and think of the ** queen ** ! '', 
  ftfy, 
  well , the remaining eu members should start a referendum about this . 
  ahh , just fade the flairs . 
  exactly the same here , too . 
  hungary wanted to nope out right from the start . 
  soros founded this university . 
  he do n't really support the orb\u00e1n regime . 
  this is the revenge . 
  looks better than a college dorm here . 
  he is taking back transylvania piece by piece . 
  so , esa is basically clockblocked ? 
  they have a lot !, 
  the best . 
  i saw the / s , but still , we are 10 . on the medal table .
