i do n't know , but it makes it easy to desribe to progress when the hero ( almost always a smallest son of a poor man ) cuts off the heads of the dragon . 
  and the living standards , wealth etc. 
   organic food can be healthier this can not be backed up by sufficient scientific evidence . 
  but they cost the same or even more in ee . 
  these castles have been improved , extended and rebuilt over and over again throughout the centuries . 
  there is no single `` historical appearance '' of them . 
  in another thread i read he actually only had to modify something in the dom tree , so a simple editing of an element in inspection mode . 
  actually it was not in the url , but sent as a post parameter . 
  are you allowed to put stuff directly in this in german stores ( or where you live ) , like in the first picture ? 
  are n't you supposed to put it either into a shopping cart or a shopping basket provided by the store ? 
  putting stuff in your own bags , while still shopping in the supermarket is generally considered stealing , but where 's the line drawn ? 
  can i pack stuff in a backpack ? 
  how about a handbag ? 
  or is it subjectively decided ? 
  [ take your canvas baaags ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evh15aut8-c ), 
  how does that compare to all that paper/plastic packaging that your food is in ? 
  buy bread ? 
  paper bag . 
  buy frozen veggies ? 
  plastic bag . 
  fresh fruit and vegetables ? 
  chips ? 
  meat ? 
  milk ? 
  shower gel ? 
  how much is this thin plastic bag in comparison with all that plastic that you actually fill it with ? 
  sorry , million . 
  point is that guy in pic has 590m vs 850m of the real richest . 
  i think only people who live in hungary are counted here . 
  see my comment . 
  unfortunately the title of this post is quite bad so it probably wo n't catch on , but it 's an interesting story that would be worth some visibility . 
  tldr : police arrests guy who found and reported a bug in online public transport ticket shop of budapest . 
  * new online public transport ticket shop gets developed by t-systems in budapest * 18-year-old discovers a huge bug in the system that lets one change the price of tickets by simply changing a url parameter ( manages to buy a monthly pass for like 1 % of the true price ) * he reports the issue to the public transport company immediately * the developer ( t-systems ) , instead of thanking him , presses charges against guy at the police ( maybe not the proper english term ) * police comes and arrests him at night * story hits news , masses of angry people dislike t-systems and the public transport company on facebook, 
  hungary is wrong . 
  the photo shows gy\u00f6rgy gatty\u00e1n , creator of livejasmin.com ( an online camgirl / live porn service ) , but he 's only the third richest with 590 ~ ~ b ~ ~ million eur , while the richest is s\u00e1ndor cs\u00e1nyi , banker , ceo of otp bank since 1992 . 
  he has 850 million eur ( just barely short of a billion usd ) . 
  i usually calculate about 3-4 hours after 1-2 beers . 
   why waste more keys on them because it 's quicker to type if the letters appear frequently enough . 
  the hungarian keyboard also has separate keys for \u00e1\u00e9\u00ed\u00f3\u00f6\u0151\u00fa\u00fc\u0171 and it would be a pain in the ass if we had to press two keys for each such letter . 
  that 's not very different from an \u00e4 , \u00f6 , \u00fc in a surname ( which happens quite often ) . 
  i would guess that they can always officially use the alternative spelling with `` ae '' , `` oe '' , `` ue '' and `` ss '' abroad . 
  we hungarians also usually have to replace our \u00e1\u00e9\u00ed\u00f3\u00f6\u0151\u00fa\u00fc\u0171 with aeiooouuu when buying plane tickets etc. 
  abroad . 
  he used to be vice president of the liberal international until 2000 or so . 
  he started out as a liberal , then in the mid 90s he turned national-conservative-civic , then around 2010 he became nationalist-populist . 
  same origin as german `` kerl '' meaning `` guy '' . 
  yeah , they are too sweet for me too . 
  [ this ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tgqsdz-paaw/u8jbkkxmkwi/aaaaaaaaace/pr43uhkjvra/s1600/paprikafeher.jpg ) is the standard hungarian paprika ( i mean in this type , not the really spicy one , we call both `` paprika '' ) . 
  it 's more sour and goes well with tomatoes and salami/sausage . 
  tomatoes and this kind of paprika go hand in hand in hungarian cuisine . 
  i 've seen it sometimes sold in germany too . 
  but just seasonally . 
  funny that you got downvoted , when it 's factually correct . 
  transylvania was administratively incorporated into hungary at the 1867 compromise ( the creation of austria-hungary ) . 
  transylvania was a separate administrative region before 1867 , as part of the austrian empire ( we call it habsburg monarchy in hungary ) . 
  the union with transylvania was one of the 12 demands of the hungarian revolutionaries of 1848 . 
  so it was a symbolic thing for the compromise . 
  most do . 
  i think the government is miscalculating and this will fire back . 
  maybe i 'm in a bubble , but this just seems too much even for the uneducated . 
  but they have very good propagandists including arthur j. finkelstein the gay jew who has no issues whatsoever orchestrating major homophobic or anti-semitic campaigns ( i do n't mean his campaigns in hungary , but elsewhere ) and his hungarian equivalent \u00c1rp\u00e1d habony . 
  so perhaps they did the math and surveys and this is effective ... 
  they could do that in less visible ways . 
  i think they simply think they found the jackpot with this illegal migration topic . 
  they were going downhill until the summer/autumn of 2015 , jobbik pulling towards the center etc. 
  then the migrant crisis gave a boost to their popularity ( i think rightfully at the time ) . 
  but then from 2016 the acute problem disappeared . 
  basically no more masses trying to enter hungary illegally . 
  the numbers have fallen drastically . 
  so how can they keep this useful topic alive until the elections ? 
  this topic is so good at increasing their popularity they ca n't let it go . 
  they decided to go all in . 
  this topic must drown everything else in the political discourse . 
  no education , healthcare , economy , corruption etc in the news , just this . 
  so they organized a referendum , campaigns before , campaigns after . 
  a national consultation with campaigns before and after . 
  and campaigns inbetween . 
  orb\u00e1n has become paranoid since he lost the 2002 elections . 
  he could n't have imagined that they were going to lose . 
  but the socialists used some really good populist demagogue strategies and won . 
  orb\u00e1n never forgot . 
  this was his main lesson . 
  his second and third terms are very different from his first . 
  there he catered to the intellectuals , the educated `` citizenry '' , his base was the modern higher-middle class conservatives . 
  now his base is the plebs . 
  i think we would have ended up much better if only orb\u00e1n had won back in 2002 . 
  it would be a very different orb\u00e1n now . 
  it 's the result of the `` national consultation '' . 
  where the govt sent out survey forms with extremely loaded questions and then 99 % of those who sent it back said they are against illegal immigration ... with the referendum it was [ 98 % ] ( http://img4.hvg.hu/image.aspx?id=0208c95e-ec4d-4081-b4a0-6d4af16ce9d1&amp;view=da658e97-86c0-40f3-acd3-b0a850f32c30 ) . 
  apparently the ads were effective , +1 % after all ... 
  traditionally hungarian translations do n't make a big deal of changing character names . 
  if the translator feels the name does n't evoke the right feeling/atmosphere/connotations in hungarian as it does in the original , they 'll mercilessly change them . 
  several names of the american series `` dallas '' were changed , scar of lion king was renamed etc. 
  when looking up character names in wikipedia , it happens very often that basically all languages call it the original name , only hungarian has a customized one . 
  i can support this when done well , for example in this case ( not always though ) . 
  only in western and northern europe . 
  poor americans would seem rich compared to poor hungarians or romanians . 
  has been asked and discussed in this sub many times , so a search can give you some more info . 
  it 's big in hungary just like the olympics or any competition because we feel like we can be relevant for a short time and so on .
