  often used by nationalists . 
  the striped have medieval origins but were also used by the fascists around wwii . 
  otherwise the stripes are part of the coat of arms of hungary and of many local flags and coats of arms . 
  we have our own paprika `` sauce '' called er\u0151s pista ( = strong steve ) . 
  it 's a kind of chili sauce , made of chili peppers . 
  the uk uses `` ethnicity '' almost just as a more acceptable synonym of race . 
  elsewhere it 's used such that czechs , poles , hungarians , italians etc are all different ethnicities . 
  hence the miscommunication . 
  it seems to me that a lot of kids are diagnosed with this in the us . 
  what percentage of kids are on some drugs for such reasons ? 
  i think the question is whether it 's a normal thing that school should adapt to , or really an illness . 
  i mean , do we organize schools the wrong way or are these kids the wired the wrong way ? 
  depends on the age . 
  also depends on what `` ca n't sit still '' means ? 
  does he get up and run around the classroom or does he just fidget and not pay attention ? 
  i think until a recently ( ~ 15 years ) nobody really thought this would be a disorder . 
  just a mischievous kid who is bored by the dry stuff they have to learn and understandably yearns for the free play time . 
  nowadays people do say `` hyperactive '' but also quite loosely , not only when someone is diagnosed . 
  boys are somewhat assumed to be like this from their nature , but if a girl is hyperactive , she 'll have less understanding teachers , because they assume girls are diligent and write nicely and sit nicely etc. 
  ( maybe not any more , i went to school in the late nineties ) . 
  much fewer kids/people are diagnosed of adhd here than in the us . 
  normally , such a thing is just seen as a lively , mischievous kid , a normal kid , not a sick child . 
  it 's normal that kids do n't like sitting in one place for 45 minutes . 
  psychatric medication is taken more carefully here especially for children . 
  the more usual the car , the easier it is to maintain it . 
  if there is huge demand for the replacement parts and other things , then it 's going to be cheaper . 
  if all mechanics know the car by heart , it 's simpler to have it serviced . 
  maybe german cars are unusual in the us , but in europe they are very well known . 
  maintaining a usual volkswagen , like a golf is pretty okay . 
  never heard of it . 
  sounds fascinating , can you tell me the german words for these ( apprentice , journeyman , master of the craft , chamber and guild ) ? 
  is ausbildung and azubi related to this ? 
  no and i also do n't really know about anyone paying the neighbor 's kid or so , i think paying kids and this whole `` business thinking '' is not as big at least in my circles . 
  but maybe other hungarians do it . 
  i heard it in nrw in the meaning of `` sowieso '' ( anyway ) , but not really in the other meanings or i just have n't noticed . 
  i heard this a lot in germany . 
  when we did some renovations we just put the bags of cement , sand etc. 
  in the personal car ( the rear seats can be folded forwards so there 's more space ) and made a few trips . 
  this is often enough . 
  it may be surprising how much can fit into a normal car and some part of the load is allowed to hang outside ( e.g. 
  for a tree ) . 
  otherwise , for a lot more stuff it 's simplest to ask for delivery . 
  it 's also often possible to transport it home by yourself using a truck/van ( think mercedes sprinter or similar ) provided by the store . 
  my grandfather used to eat watermelon with a slice of bread ( he just ate everything with bread i think ) , so i could imagine someone eating pineapple with bread . 
  no , you will need a passport if you have no national id . 
  http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/entry-exit/eu-citizen/index_en.htm  driving licences , post , bank or tax cards are not accepted as valid travel documents or proof of identity . 
  driving licenses are often accepted from local citizens , but they are not accepted from foreigners ( for proving identity ; obviously they are accepted for the purpose of driving ) . 
  there has n't been any shooting at any hungarian school ever , and it 's not likely to happen . 
  the only shooting in any hungarian educational institution was in the p\u00e9cs university in 2009 , with 1 dead and 3 wounded . 
  but we do have a fire alarm rehearsal every year . 
  there 's no genetic test that can reliably differentiate hungarians from slovaks or other nearby populations . 
  still they are different ethnicities . 
  i mostly agree with the wikipedia here ( but i do n't think ethnicity can be `` adopted '' later in life ) :  an ethnic group or ethnicity is a category of people who identify with each other based on similarities such as ** common ancestral , language , social , cultural or national experiences ** . 
  [ 1 ] [ 2 ] ethnicity is often an ** inherited status based on the society in which one lives ** . 
  in some cases , it can be adopted if a person moves into another society [ citation needed ] . 
  membership of an ethnic group tends to be defined by a ** shared cultural heritage , ancestry , origin myth , history , homeland , language or dialect , symbolic systems such as religion , mythology and ritual , cuisine , dressing style , art , and physical appearance . 
  ethnicity is not only about genetics though . 
  it 's also about growing into a culture ( in broad terms , not just arts and recipes but everyday behavior ) and language etc. 
  do n't say `` i am x '' as an american who only has a small glimpse into those cultures . 
  say `` i have some lithuanian and polish ancestors '' or `` some of my family are lithuanians and poles '' . 
  by the way , do you have any ancestors who are not from lithuania/poland but other americans who married into that line ? 
  people often forget about many of their ancestors and just focus on one branch . 
  all nations should have the right to independence . 
  i 'd support the result of a referendum . 
   since czechs , ** hungarians ** , slovaks , etc. 
  obviously deserve their own countries hungary did n't get any territory from austria , just the other way around ( burgenland ) . 
  only in separate tobacco shops that need a special license . 
  what others describe here does n't really apply to hungary . 
  we are usually very happy if someone with hungarian ancestry tries to take up the language and learn about the culture . 
  this meme of americans claiming to be x ( e.g. 
  hungarian ) and actual x people getting mad about it is something i 've only seen on reddit . 
   slovakia was doing fairly well slovakia did not exist then . 
  there was a moravian principality in the general area , but equating that with slovakia is an anachronism . 
  also , history is taught * very * differently in hungary and slovakia , so we usually talk beside each other , since our basic knowledge we learned in school as small kids is just so different . 
  our grades go from 1 ( fail ) to 5 ( best ) . 
  there are no set percentages , the grade limits are set by the teacher for each particular test . 
  there 's no choice or flexibility about how many and which subjects you have . 
  in each year/grade there is a fixed set of subjects that everyone has . 
  students who are in the same year are organized into 3-5 classes and those classes take all subjects together . 
  they have their own classroom , where many/most of their lessons take place , but sometimes they have lessons in different classrooms . 
  in my school we could choose a few advanced subjects in the last two years of secondary school ( grammar school , gimn\u00e1zium ) . 
  they were for those people who planned to take the advanced level final exams ( \u00e9retts\u00e9gi , like the german abitur ) . 
  students take a series of big final exams at the end of gimn\u00e1zium ( in 5 subjects : math , hungarian language and literature , history , a foreign language and at least one freely chosen subject ) . 
  your results determine your score that is used for applying to hungarian universities . 
  you can choose advanced level exams in some subjects to get more points . 
  so in the last two years of school you can choose to take a more intensive version of certain subjects . 
  so as i said , we have a fixed set of subjects prescribed for each year . 
  math is one subject , and we go through the different topics depending on what is prescribed for what year . 
  so we do n't have `` algebra '' , it 's just that the teacher comes in when we have math lesson and says `` today we will begin the next chapter , on equation systems ( or whatever ) '' . 
  science is not integrated , we have physics , chemistry , biology and geography all as separate subjects with separate teachers . 
  such elective classes do n't exist . 
  what does exist , is for example if you plan on taking geography final exams at the very end , they you can take geography in the last year , even though it is not mandatory for those who wo n't do that exam . 
  but woodworking and such are not offered in a gimn\u00e1zium ( as it 's supposed to be more intellectual , preparing you for university ) , although there is probably such a thing in the other , more practical types of secondary schools ( i do n't know much about those ) . 
  there is quite a lot of homework in hungary . 
  but i also heard some countries have abolished it . 
  it 's illegal , but extremely rarely enforced for pedestrians . 
  for cyclists i think it 's more risky . 
  because we are copied the system of other countries when we changed the system in 1990 . 
  the biggest barrier to becoming a proper kingdom with a king/queen has been the fact that we have no good candidate for this role . 
  the habsburg family has lost its chance in 1848-49 when they brutally crushed the revoltion .
