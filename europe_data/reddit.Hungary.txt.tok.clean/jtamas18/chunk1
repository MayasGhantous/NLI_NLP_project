in addition to what u/tack50 said , it should be noted that different election systems fit different countries . 
  the uk 's systems fits countries with 2 big parties . 
  but hungary dos n't have 2 big parties , and when the new voting system was introduced by fidesz , the left-wing opposition was already breaking up into several small parties and the jobbik appeared on the political spectrum , meaning there will be only a single big party ( fidesz ) . 
  this means the fidesz government could be overcome only if all opposition parties formed an alliance ( even the jobbik would need to ally with the leftist parties ) . 
  which is impossible . 
  and to that , add that the press is owned by the government or businessmen close to them . 
  we are stuck with this shit government for eternity . 
  this is n't really saying anything . 
  any of these words can be pronounced in quite a few ways depending on which language you read it in . 
  actually , the war was lost in 1866 an the negotiations started before the war ( though they became faster after austria 's defeat ) . 
   estonia has finland 's influence for obvious reasons which you do n't see in latvia . 
  the obvious reason being ... ? 
  haha , look at us . 
  just asking , why did n't many romanians go to france ? 
  similar situation here . 
  in my native language ( hungarian ) there is no difference between a tortoise and a turtle , so i used them interchangeably for quite a while . 
  the problem is you took the quote out of context . 
  the quote , in the context necessary to understand what tolkien means here , looks like this : `` may i say that all this is ` mythical ' , and not any kind of new religion or vision . 
  as far as i know it is merely an imaginative invention , to express , in the only way i can , some of my ( dim ) apprehensions of the world . 
  all i can say is that , if it were ` history ' , it would be difficult to fit the lands and events ( or ` cultures ' ) into such evidence as we possess , archaeological or geological , concerning the nearer or remoter part of what is now called europe ; though the shire , for instance , is expressly stated to have been in this region i could have fitted things in with greater versimilitude , if the story had not become too far developed , before the question ever occurred to me . 
  i doubt if there would have been much gain ; and i hope the , evidently long but undefined , gap in time between the fall of barad-d\u00fbr and our days is sufficient for ` literary credibility ' , even for readers acquainted with what is known or surmised of ` pre-history ' . '', 
  tolkien here makes a distinction between ` mythological ' and ` historical ' past . 
  he 's saying his world should be taken as a mythical past and not as a historical , because a historical past would mean we could say things like ` gondor = italy ' or ` the english are the descendants of the numenorians ' . 
  trying to make such connections between tolkien 's would and the known history of our world would n't make sense , since lotr and tolkien 's other works were n't written with the idea in mind that such connections should exist . 
  he also says ` the shire , for instance , is expressly stated to have been in this region ' , which proves that middle-earth = europe . 
  ` evidently long but undefined , gap in time between the fall of barad-d\u00fbr and our days is sufficient for ` literary credibility ' , even for readers acquainted with what is known or surmised of ` pre-history ' . '', 
  -  here tolkien is giving an excuse for why we ca n't recognize obvious connections between the history/geography of our world and his . 
  `` the theatre of my tale is this earth , the one in which we now live , but the historical period is imaginary . '', 
  [ this is a map of arda drawn by tolkien ] ( http://tolkiengateway.net/w/images/f/f2/j.r.r._tolkien_-_ambarkanta_map_%28colorized%29.gif ) . 
  it is easy to recognize the continent that is south of middle-earth and that has the shape of today 's africa . 
  care to elaborate on what i was wrong about ? 
  no , he was definitely talking about middle-earth . 
  according to the lore of tolkien 's world ( called arda , of which middle-earth is only a part ) , it is actually not a fantasy world but our world from the past , with middle-earth being the equivalent of europe . 
  according to arda 's lore , after sauron 's defeat the elves left middle-earth for valinor and the other mythical species likely went extinct , so our age , the `` age of men '' started . 
  fun fact : according to lotr lore , lotr , the hobbit and the silmarillion were n't written by tolkien . 
  tolkien supposedly found `` the red book '' , which contained an account of bilbo 's journey written by bilbo , an account of the war of the ring written by frodo and sam , and translations of elvish legends ( to westron , the lingua franca of middle-earth ) by bilbo . 
  tolkien translated these works to english , and published them ( except the silmarillion , which was published after his death ) . 
  does this event contradict that though ? 
  it says people are equal before the law regardless of race , but this event has nothing to do with the law . 
  i 'm asking seariously , i do n't know anything about law so that 's just a layman 's interpretation . 
  a bit ? 
  what 's the name of that conservative journalist you speak of ? 
  it 's true that the application for citizenship was simplified , but not for the reason you mentioned . 
  many hungarians living in the areas that used to belong to hungary had long wanted to become citizens of the country . 
  [ there was even a referendum about his ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_dual_citizenship_referendum,_2004 ) . 
  since fidesz campaigned for the simplified citizenship application and they made it a law after they won the elections in 2014 , people who got citizenship ended up voting for fidesz . 
  the vast majority of hungarians living abroad voted for them in the 2014 parliamentary elections ( [ about 95 % ] ( http://4liberty.eu/republikon-institute-election-2014-turnout-and-the-impact-of-the-electoral-system/ ) ) . 
  so the main reason was simply to win the votes of these people living abroad . 
  my reaction : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1ffvweqnsm, 
  thanks !, 
  thought it would be from that book . 
  i 've been meaning to read it for months , unfortunately could n't make time for it . 
  i mean , ok , identity crisis does change people , but the change can be of many kinds - this girl could easily just have taken up a new hobby , became involved in some other form of social behaviour etc. 
  identity crisis in itself is not sufficient to explain the phenomena - there must be other reasons why these people move towards erdogan 's demagogy . 
  where is that quote from ? 
  what caused that change ? 
  sorry if it 's too personal , i am just curious why a turkish person who was born and grew up in a country like the netherlands would change so much . 
  it 's the village where orb\u00e1n was born and spent his childhood . 
  a [ `` dinkey line '' ] ( https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c3%a1l-v%c3%b6lgyi_kisvas%c3%bat ) was built here with eu money ( such things are only run in areas with lots of tourists in other cases ) and the town 's football team is funded by the state and plays in the second devision ( last year they played in the first ) . 
  even though the town has only 1700 residents , a [ new stadium was built here with 3400 seats ] ( http://m.cdn.blog.hu/ap/appleblog/image/felcsut-02.jpg ) ) . 
  due to the reasons mentioned above the town has become a symbol of 1 . the corruption of the government , 2 . spending loads of money on obviously useless things 3 . 
  orb\u00e1n 's obsession with football . 
  so , in other worlds , it symbolises almost everything hated about the government . 
  yes , his username translates to that . 
  none of what he sepaks is true by the way , he should be ignored . 
  so you are tired of yourself ? 
  dutch revolt is taught in hungary as well . 
  the dog is eating the cat . 
  the dog ** is eating ** the cat . 
  the dog is eating the cat and is doing nothing else to it . 
  emphasis on eating . 
  it is the cat that the dog is eating . 
  the dogs is eating only the cat . 
  emphasis on cat . 
  it is the dog that is eating the cat . 
  only the dog is eating the cat . 
  emphasis on dog . 
  by the way , i do n't agree with you on english word order being complicated . 
  as you can see , my native language has a word order you would n't call strict , but i had no problem with the english word order . 
  to be honest , i think the less ` strict ' a word order is , the more difficult it is to learn ( even for people who are familiar with the concept ) , because that does n't mean you can put the words in any order , that means you can make changes in word order that have huge effect on your emphasis and if you misuse it you will be misunderstood . 
   chair is feminine der stuhl, 
   people like you would get eaten alive without the eu . 
  uh ... what ? 
  haha , exactly what i was thinking when i opened this thread . 
  but i saw an other thread about native speakers of finnish , so i thought there might be some non-native hungarian speakers too . 
  hell , i was wrong . 
  yep but cases in hungarian are very different . 
  they are like prepositions with the only difference being they are at the end of words . 
  for example asztal - table , asztalon - on the table . 
  they are actually much easier to use for language learners than cases in german . 
  added them . 
  list is getting longer . 
  yeah , whore is probably a better translation . 
  it does n't mean a female dog , though ( at least not in hungarian ) . 
  that 's ` szuka ' , which can also be used as a derogatory term for women . 
  edited ` bitch ' to ` whore ' and added ` szuka ' . 
  sex . 
  literal translations : fasz - dick l\u00f3fasz - horse dick faszfej - dickhead faszszop\u00f3 - cock sucker faszom \u00f6ccse - my cock 's ( younger ) brother seggfej - asshead kurva - ~ ~ bitch ~ ~ more like whore/prostitute ribanc - bitch szuka - female dog , derogatory term for women . 
  k\u00f6cs\u00f6g - jug/jar , not literally the passive one in a male homosexual sexual intercourse buzi/buzer \u00e1ns - gay punci - pussy kurva any\u00e1d - your mother is a bitch baszd meg - fuck it baszd meg a kurva any\u00e1d - fuck your whore/prostitute mother . 
  p\u00f6cs - fasz p\u00f6csfej - p\u00f6cshead p\u00f6csk\u00f6sz\u00f6r\u0171 - dick grinder,
