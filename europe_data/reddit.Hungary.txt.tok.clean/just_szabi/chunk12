  not an uncommon sight in hungary , really , they 've been around my town for a few weeks now . 
  usually there are nato trainings in the bakony mountains in hungary . 
  its good and all , and fcking loud , but thanks guys for being here . 
  cheaper to get there is also an important point in `` cheaper '' in general . 
  while you would have to drive through the balkans , or fly to greece , you can simply have a nice 6-8 hr drive to croatia . 
  finally , i 'm better than average in something !, 
  i 'm 172 . 
  remember , there was no berlin wall , cuban missile crisis or vietnam war then , yet . 
  you will find a way , you always did and you always will . 
  you ca n't really change it with that attitude , can you ? 
  people are slowly uniting ... 
  right , people with horrible stereotypes would be outrageous . 
  not really . 
  what we see is n't the reality , mostly , people are fighting for their rights and telling their opinion . 
  millions of turkish people , even if only with their words , are fighting for a brighter future . 
  it is the same in hungary , just in smaller , very slowly , but changes will begin and this will be over . 
  turkey might be close to the middle east , but culturally and geographically its different than the other middle-eastern countries like saudi or syria . 
  mostly the countries in the middle east are arabic countries , while turkish people are anatolians or kurdish or one other from the i dont know how many minorities . 
  when you are saying middle east , people ( in europe in general , i 'd say ) would think you are talking about israel , syria , iraq and iran . 
  seriously , a girl from antep hit me for joking around middle eastern stereotypes . 
  i agree with you , only old people or someone from miskolc would say they dont like walking around at night ... 
  sometimes i feel safer at night than at day , although i live in a small village . 
  for real though i would 've definitely mentioned germany and russia ... 
  i dont remember where , but somebody actually calculated that the tour de france riders are having the same average speed , as the budapest-p\u00e9cs train . 
  although there are construction on that line now , so that is the reason for it . 
  nice . 
  well the speed limit on our tracks are 160km/h , but only few trains reach that speed , however there is only around 300km 's of tracks that can handle that speed . 
  trust me , i 've been up there , is tall . 
  veeeeery tall . 
  probably . 
  you will be stuck in vienna anyways , like last time . 
  i will never forget when in a very drunk new years eve , i met a norwegian guy in budapest , and we talked about europe , our countries , cheap beers . 
  i just love talking to foreign people ... 
  no , we dont use it . 
  many people have flags of szeklerland on their houses though , remembering our `` lost brothers '' . 
  [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/coat_of_arms_of_hungary.svg/800px-coat_of_arms_of_hungary.svg.png ) is the current coat of arms of hungary , with the holy crown on the top , left part is the so called '' \u00c1rp\u00e1d stripes '' , the right part is the three hills , on top of it with the byzantine double cross . 
  the right part could symbolise the carpathians and the lost borders , the double cross is for the christianity . 
  i did n't know that hungary was cheaper than almost every neighboring country . 
  we are still complaining though , and lots of hungarians go to ukraine to refuel . 
  the last one is indeed the habsburg house . 
  [ here it is in bigger . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/wappen_habsburg-lothringen_schild.svg/545px-wappen_habsburg-lothringen_schild.svg.png ) the lion is the habsburg , the tricolor is the house babenberg ( austrian dynasty before the habsburg ) , and the three birds are the loraine part of the family . 
  true for basic users , probably not true for the army . 
  thankfully , we are fighting them back . 
  ... on a sadder note , we will probably do something that caused the whole middle-east fuck up * again . 
  funny thing is , it was banned in hungary too , and i 've never saw anyone smoking inside since , but only in budapest . 
  you can take pictures like this in almost every city of the world . 
  okay , maybe not scandinavia , but still . 
  its very interesting though , i like contrasts like this . 
  same in hungary too , twitter is just ignored because of fb , although i think twitter is better . 
  twitter is the main social media in turkey . 
  interesting to see how much twitter turkish people use compared to eastern europe . 
  probably no reason to make their mix so rough , since it doesnt go over 30 and below 0 that much in the uk ? 
  that would be my guess . 
  i would give you all my wealth for a week of raining now . 
  drink while you do it . 
  you wont feel thirst , but you will be very thirsty . 
  also if its your first time , you should be with someone sober . 
  this works for every dug basically . 
  i got ta admit , the shape and the marks on the pills are amazing sometimes . 
  i 'm not trying to deny climate change here , all i am saying is that from my experience , from my mothers experience , from her mothers experience , everybody measured 40 \u00b0 c in their lives , in summers . 
  what i meant to say is that people are so hyped up with this topic suddenly , when it was definitely caused by us , and it did n't start in the 2000 's . 
  obviously we are making it even worse day by day . 
  my reference is recorded by the omsz , which is the main weather activity measuring thing in hungary . 
  data is going back to 1871 , every day has been recorded since . 
  the 29/12/1985 data is from somogyszob , a little town in the middle of nowhere , but it is n't flat land , its surrounded by hills and forests . 
  now the interesting thing about 1985 's winter being so mild is that the ' 84/85 and the 86/87 winter was recorded as `` extreme cold '' . 
  not because of records , but because of the very cold temperature was noticeable for more than 20 days . 
  not in the uk , but i have exams next week . 
  weather forecast says it will be between 33 and 38 . 
  climate was weird and different centuries ago too , saying that climate change accidentally just hit earth a few years ago is a big mistake . 
  there were incredibly cold summers and very mild winters in the past too . 
  for example , it was 19 \u00b0 c on the 29th of december , 1985 . 
  they have been doing this for years now , and every year they have more supporters which is good . 
  good for a country like turkey . 
  i really like this track , probably more than the hungaroring . 
  its really nothing crazy , but the elevations and the nice corners ... love old school f1 tracks !, 
  and also quite happy to see it back in the calendar . 
  i do that at home too . 
  the outer sides of the roads are usually bumpy , but the middle part isnt . 
  i will need you to take down your flair , please . 
  unless that t\u00far\u00f3 rudi is filled with p\u00e1linka . 
  it could be a map from the 16th century , summing the situation in the 15th . 
  the battle of moh\u00e1cs is shown on this map and that was in 1526 . 
  its funny how the creator wrote `` veszpr\u00e9m '' as vesprim . 
  i guess foreigns would say it like that :d, 
  probably there was a ceo meeting in the hq of telekom , and they decided that not enough customers would change , or they dont need it . 
  i dont know , actually , internet companies are doing the same stuff here too . 
  except for one . 
  there is a romanian ( if i 'm correct ) one , called digi . 
  they are selling * fast as fuck * internet for basically no money at all , ruining the competition in hungary . 
  one bad note though , they ca n't even be found in all cities of hungary , let alone the rural areas . 
  but i 'm seriously saying that they must be the reason why the others are offering gigabit internet too nowadays . 
  of course you are , its cheaper to build a whole network from nothing than upgrading the current one . 
  and faster . 
  glad to hear , i heard the huger amount of refugees and the problems in kilis were bad . 
  if you are a guest , you should n't just show your d\u00f6ner in the face of a t\u00fcrk while its ramadan . 
  how 's the situation down in gaziantep nowadays ? 
  quite late to blame you for syria , i guess . 
  even though some still complain about the loss of transylvania and other territories like that , the intelligent ones from us still have every right to be unhappy about trianon , justice could have been [ better ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/ethnographic_map_of_hungary_1910_by_teleki_carte_rouge.jpg/800px-ethnographic_map_of_hungary_1910_by_teleki_carte_rouge.jpg ) .
