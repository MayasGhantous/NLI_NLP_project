  but sadly the people are behind them , because there is no strong alternative . 
  i wish eu ditched us though , because then we could lynch these idiots and start everything over . 
  finish what we started in 1989 . 
  you really dont see that you would n't just punish the orb\u00e1n gang , but 10 million of us ? 
  its still not comparable to literally any country thats western to poland , i imagine . 
  there is a reason thousands of young men and women leaving this area . 
   p\u00e1linka  slovakian flag next to op 's username ** triggered **, 
  well erdogan did it a few years ago and last year aswell , but there will always be someone who is angry . 
  24 million voted no . 
  there was a post or two about it last week here , but it did n't get that big of an attention . 
  but turkey has nothing to do with the eu , and we would never vote to leave it , so how are we exactly dismantling it ? 
  all those coups were the army standing up and saying no . 
  there will be a coup , just a matter of time . 
  i do n't think the allies could have done anything about stopping the soviets , and they did n't even have intentions and resources to do an action in eastern europe . 
  the later they attack , the worse it gets , because they had to attack in spring ( instead of that , they had delayed it to summer ) and the soviets were catching up in tech . 
  we have to keep in mind that the winter and the mud already stopped the blitzkrieg quite a bit , and the soviet factories were put to `` get ready for the war '' mode for quite a long time in 1942 . 
  nobody allowed them though , at least not the way you are saying it . 
  the allies , especially churchill , did n't allow him to advance so far . 
  in fact , they could n't do anything about it , and had to make a run with the americans as eastern as possible , to save as many as possible . 
  there was a guy , a reporter of some sort i believe , who was a hungarian jew . 
  he wrote in his memoir , that the [ lager of recsk ] ( https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/recski_k%c3%a9nyszermunkat%c3%a1bor ) , what was built in the communist era , was worse than auschwitz and dachau . 
  and he has been in all three . 
  yes , the nazis did terrible things , but you ca n't deny that the soviets were - at least - in pair with them . 
  ask a pole or a hungarian , they will say that communism was worse than the nazis for many . 
  ** obviously , they have been staying for a longer time . 
  original ? 
  you mean ... ** n\u00e1ndorfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r ? 
  the funny thing is that supporters of the government are in fact the ones who collapsed the system in 1989 , and `` fought '' for the democracy . 
  almost 30 years later , the procedure of changing the system has stopped somewhere in the middle , and we are getting influenced by the russians again . 
  do n't get me wrong , they were influencing us before aswell , its just now the gov. 
  turned into anti-eu , or at least it seems like it , so people think its pro-russian . 
  however russian influence is great , and the supporters are still with orb\u00e1n , the supporters who collapsed the communist system . 
  the younger generations pov is different , but our word is not enough . 
  yet . 
  in hungary , aldi and lidl have higher reputation and wages than tesco , auchan and interspar . 
  lidl and aldi are usually selling german things abroad or brands with no real name . 
  for example you ca n't get 0,33 coke or pepsi in lidl 's in hungary , just their cola . 
  also , there are no energy drinks , just hell ( which is hungarian so probably they have a contract with them ) . 
  but we really like their bakery . 
  my favourite part of the protest was two days ago , on the day of the hungarian poetry , when some protesters wrote [ the bards of wales ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_bards_of_wales ) with chalk on the road where orb\u00e1n 's house is . 
  now this ballad is huge metaphor , and when arany wrote it it was meant to criticise the habsburgs because of 1848 , and the meaning of this work is perfectly usable against the government . 
  all this on the day of the hungarian poetry , 
  carlo pedersoli ( bud spencer ) and mario girotti ( terence hill ) are both from italy . 
  we have the similar style , `` tegnapel\u0151tt '' and `` holnaput\u00e1n '' . 
  tegnap means yesterday , holnap means tomorrow , el\u0151tt is before , ut\u00e1n is after . 
  elementary : around 25-30 students per class , 16 classes ( 8 grades , 2 classes per grade ) , so around 400-450 students , but there were a little bit bigger schools than mine . 
  high school : around 1000 students , and it is the biggest school in my town , however it has the normal 4 grades ( 9th to 12th ) , plus two other years of technical school ( not obligatory ) , plus its a technical school so we have more classes too . 
  usual schools are half or a litte bit more in size than ours . 
  barefoot at home ( everyone ) , however at relatives and friends , usually just socks . 
  except for my grandma , if she ever sees me stepping on the mettlachi ( comes from the german town mettlach , we use this name for the ceramic floor thats cold as fuck in winters ) , she yells at me to get my slippers . 
  do n't worry about kosovo , kfor has its back . 
  we kinda like you , bruder < 3, 
  i kinda taught turkish exchangers about the history of hungary and our city . 
  its weird when they think that we are their long lost brothers , and we are singing songs about gutting their soldiers . 
  yeah , easy 10 . 
  now this is an opinion we europeans share , turks ( and in turks i mean kurdish people too ) not so much . 
  lots of kurdish people are well integrated to the society in turkey , because the country works in such a way that it says `` everybody who lives here is turkish , not a minority . '', 
  there are around 80 minorities in turkey , but they are dealing with this situation a lot differently than we are . 
  so , most of the turkish kurds are quiet and spread across the country , however , as we know there is a huge minority in syria and iraq too . 
  the middle east is a complete disaster right now , and i would say that bringing in another country , with a different culture , with a different religion , with the acts that they 've done ** against ** the iraqi and syrians , no please dont do it . 
  if there is one thing that wont solve the problems of the middle east , but make it worse , is making an independent kurdistan . 
  i 'd say its pretty small , like for example if i think about german or french music , they equal rap music for me . 
  in hungary though , pop music is definitely the winner and most people dont care about rap . 
  we also have some awful `` gangster rappers '' . 
  yeah , you can imagine , its not nice . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhofd7twzta ) dude is amazing , i dont know whats the average french opinion about him though, 
  [ franz liszt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franz_liszt ) could be one of them . 
  technically he was born in the hungarian part of the ( then ) austrian empire , his parents were hungarians but he was n't that good with the language . 
  according to hungarian wiki though , he claimed that he is hungarian and his children were hungarians too , even though he spent most of his life in other european countries . 
  not country , but there are lots of tourists who change up budapest with bucharest . 
  budapest , obviously , is better . 
  george soros , of course . 
  he is trying to destroy my country by building universities and feeding students with propaganda . 
  i dont really know who he is , but the tv said i should hate him , so i do . 
  we have quite a big chinese population , according to wiki the hungarian chinese population is the biggest in the area with number around 20.000 thousand , most of them came around 89 for some reason . 
  i dont really meet them generally , because they mostly live in budapest , but there are some families in my city aswell , in fact i also know a girl who was born here with chinese ancestors . 
  some of them are really hard working and they are trying to do business in here with their chinese experience , they are mostly selling clothes or having a chinese restaurant . 
  even though hungarian is quite hard , most of whom i 've met have learned it partially or still learns it . 
  i think they are socially accepted now , well maybe not in the small villages where lot of old people live , but budapest is a very multicultural city nowadays . 
  we are hard with accepting others though . 
  if someone wants to sell you something , just speak english they probably wont understand and go away , or just leave them . 
  seriously , lot of people want to just scam you . 
  as op said , public transportation is the way to go , you can buy tickets in every metro station that you can use in every line . 
  for public transportation you can buy a 72 hrs ticket for 4150 huf ( around 13.5 eur ) , you can use it in almost every budapest line , and its unlimited you can go as much as you want . 
  its good for trams , buses , trolleys and for the metro , and you can travel to the city limits with it . 
  there is also a budapest card that can be bought for 72 or 96 hrs ( 10,900 ft for the first , 14,500 ft for the second option ) . 
  with this card you can visit things that are listed on [ this ] ( https://www.budapestinfo.hu/budapest-card ) site . 
  you can use it to get into museums and baths so i guess its quite a cool thing for a tourist , it depends on you if you take this or not , you might not use it fully and its not that cheap . 
  please note that both of these cards can be only used by one person , so if you have partners they will need it too . 
  it is , there are lots of public bathrooms that you can only enter for 100-200 huf . 
  that is like .5 eur . 
  you can go into cafe 's or pubs to use the restroom , but if you do you should also buy something , its quite mean to just go in and go out . 
  we call london the second hungarian city , so i think that answers the question . 
  lot of people are working in germany or german speaking countries , and lots of others working in the uk , but i think we can be found in the benelux and france aswell . 
  it is mostly for economic reasons , you can get around 3-4 times the money you earn here in hungary . 
  sadly our country does n't have competetive payment compared to austria for example , so its even students now are planning on moving away and living abroad . 
  quite sad . 
  actually there was . 
  if there was a was between the nato and the su , we would have to attack italy , through austria ( graz , klagenfurt ) . 
  we also had defensive plans against an attack by the imperialist yugoslavia .
