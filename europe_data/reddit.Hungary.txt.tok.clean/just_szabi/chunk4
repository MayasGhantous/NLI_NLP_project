  they are working in 3-4 week shifts , they get payed well but they ** have to ** go , they do n't have other options . 
  `` and why do they want to overcome the fence ? '', 
  because at the point when they left the first safe country ( their neighbours , turkey , greece , albania , serbia , anyone ) , they are not refugees but economic migrants . 
  what we know is that we came from the eurasian steppe , as the huns aswell , and as we came a few of us went other ways , some stayed in the steppes , some went to anatolia most likely . 
  well it worked a few hundred years ago , so why not . 
  ... and you took it down ? 
  leaving ? 
  [ haha . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3_i2rfapyk ), 
  probably they stop because the schedule is calculated like that and they do n't want to go early , but it would be annoying af . 
  in hungary , its the same as in germany . 
  most likely it was not a terrorist attack , but some firecrackers . 
  he was being sarcastic . 
  edit : although the thread in r/all does say differently . 
  who knows . . 
  you 've read it correctly . 
  this was meant to be a joke about us not improving at all and all our neighbors jumping us in numbers . 
  romania has been quite a nice country to be compared to , but they might be getting ahead and then the government will have to find someone else . 
  hungary is not yet compared to ukraine , so they must be a lot worse than us in economy and stuff . 
  soon , though !, 
  well , not if your enemy knows that you cant fly it , or maintain it properly . 
  well it was technically not the hungarian motto , but the one for r\u00e1k\u00f3czi 's war of independence ( from the habsburgs ) was this : * cum deo pro patria et libertate !, 
  * * for freedom and the homeland with god *, 
  exactly . 
  thousands of us are out there in budapest , right now , trying to achieve something , but with all the `` brainwashed '' , sadly there is no better word for it , its not possible . 
  where have i heard this before ? 
  oh , gotcha , in the 18th century . 
  and the 19th . 
  and the 20th . 
  the capital can be as liberal as it wants to be , but with these types of people controlling the country , the other parts of the country will never change . 
  its the same thing over and over , our society is bogged down . 
  how about trying to increase the wages in the poorest counties first ? 
  i 've heard those in szabolcs have a very good life ... 
  fascist and regime ? 
  maybe our government is stealing billions of huf , but its still not close to the commie times , and i do n't really understand why are you calling it fascist . 
  jobbik is not an anti-semitic party though . 
  many of the youngers think they will be the one to change hungary . 
  he knows that the opposition is getting stronger . 
  maybe not strong enough to get them out of the parliament , but sensibly stronger . 
  the government needs to blame someone . 
  most of the people do n't even know who he is , just that he is hungarian and `` bad '' . 
  because thats the information the media is giving us . 
  so with the government doing this hate campaign against him , it will still be liked by the people who hate gy\u00f6rgy soros . 
  and they hate him , because of the government . 
  thats so clever !, 
  i like it . 
  neighbor here , from the western side of the danube : its been 15 + c the whole week , however on monday and tuesday the morning temp . 
  was below 0 . 
  hopefully no harm for the trees ... 
  as far as i know there is no real difference between the * sakura * and the casual * cherry tree * , although the asian one might be a bit more pink-ish . 
  similarly to the post-ww2 zone of influences , there is a `` governor '' - ish guy for example from italy , governing the administration of the marked areas for the next x years . 
  their job is to recreate the pre-war economy , administration and get rid of the devastation , and also to control and use the administratives in the said province in a way that benefits the home nation . 
  ... and after this whole thing happened , if there was any other killing , bombing or incident , it would be instantly blamed on the muslims , therefor causing even more hatred and the population will be even more divided . 
  the radical muslim killers do n't understand the whole situation , neither do we though . 
  those are just mercenaries , although they do n't work for money but because of their radical motivation given by the islam . 
  the whole point is to cause distraction and fear . 
  a feared nation is an unstable nation , because fear gives more supporters for radical parties and groups , less support for the democratic solutions . 
  the men who are blowing themselves up ? 
  they are nobody . 
  they do n't do it because they are trying to achieve anything , they are blinded by their special cause , which can be mohammed , or the hate against non-muslims . 
  these groups does n't want to tear apart europe by themselves , they just want anarchy . 
  there is a story about a bloke who was born in [ munk\u00e1cs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mukacheve ) in the 1910 's i believe . 
  he was born in the austro-hungarian empire , in 1918-19 the city he was living in became a part of czechoslovakia . 
  in 1938 , with the [ help of ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_vienna_award ) mussolini and hitler , the kingdom of hungary got * k\u00e1rp\u00e1talja * back , with munk\u00e1cs , but in 1944 it was occupied and later annexed by the soviet union . 
  after the fall of the su , its now part of ukraine . 
  so this guy , whom never ever stepped outside of his city , has been living his life in 5 countries . 
  obviously at some point your ancestors were these dacian kings and tribes , but you also have to agree with me that its only a small percentage in the evolution of the romanian population . 
  as i 've said in numerous other threads , you might be as close to the first king of hungary as i was , or maybe even closer , if you are romanian , simply because our nations have been mixing with each other and dozens of other tribes in the last 1500 years . 
  the slavs could also claim that they are direct descendants of greater moravia , i can also claim that i am the direct descendant of \u00c1rp\u00e1d , and my rightful home is in mongolia , etelk\u00f6z or en route here , but ** its not true ** . 
  my children 's age will have more chance to understand that we are basically the same people here , living next to each other for centuries now . 
  its weird because our stereotypes are the same about each other but in reality its not like that . 
  yes , there are a bunch of idiots claiming to be taking over transylvania , gib bek rightful clay type , but nothing serious i guess . 
  thankfully , the overall ( and stupid ) hate is going away . 
  they have experience in these kind of things , never forget that . 
  as the interview said , life did n't change after ' 90 . 
  444 is always against the current government though . 
  and how well is he is doing it . 
  have you seen the comment wars under bbc 's facebook posts with anything russia related ? 
  its either `` that fucking putin is going to kill us '' , or , to give an answer to this `` you are just and idiot who believes in western propaganda '' . 
  and nowadays its trending to call someone a russian cyber troll aswell . 
  people are really , really stupid when it comes to this . 
  they are . 
  so does russia and china . 
  and germany , and france , and the gchq . 
  one should n't assume that its only the russians who are spying on others . 
  maybe the danubian federation or the greater austrian states could have survived for more decades , but i 'm very doubtful about it , because none of the solutions would make the romanians and serbians happy . 
  our minority policy was horrible . 
  what did you just said ? 
  shots fired ? 
  it even have the fyrom flag on it . 
  i love it . 
  thats one thing . 
  sailing a thousand miles to invade a country with everybody hating your guts is another . 
  the spanish armada was the strongest navy of europe until 1588 . 
  with a navy that big , there also comes a strong army , plus the portuguese army and navy . 
  two of the top three greatest sailing powers of the world at the time . 
  do you realise how hard would it be to sail to iberia ? 
  and how risky . 
  or even just marching , lets say a march from egypt to tlemcen would be almost 4.000 km 's , and from then you also got ta walk through morocco and land in gibraltar . 
  yes , the ottomans were very , very strong .
