  the refugee camps are not prisons . 
  people can walk in and out daytime . 
  so they just walk out and head to germany . 
  bbbut . . but ... 
  i clearly see the officer in the front trying to hold them back ... 
  you are correct that this is the duty of the border countries . 
  you are wrong on that you should not register them , if a refugee somehow manages to get in your country without prior registration . 
  i do not know man ... 
  it takes time to build up a smuggler infrastructure on the river that would allow mass transfer of immigrants via rivers . 
  on the other side , you really must not underestimate orban . 
  eventually he would rather order to fire on those people than let other hundreds of thousands in . 
  we do . 
  it is just like 60 km land then the rest is river . 
  not hating gipsies is my father 's legacy to me . 
  although i am not in contact with gipsies anymore , and seldom see any where i live , i still regularly donate a [ foundation helping gypsy children ] ( http://igazgyongy-alapitvany.hu/en ) . 
  i do n't know the gypsy law , but these people certainly considered themselves gypsy . 
  it was in a small town in the countryside with little gypsy population and they integrated well . 
  hungarian minister of foreign affairs will visit serbia today . 
  i think they will synch on the issue and i speculate on that in case serbia is closing the borders then hu will send significant police force to serbias southern border to help out in the border defense . 
  we will see . 
  my father 's restaurant is the proof that gipsies can be integrated and other european nations can live happily in peace with them . 
  he had a restaurant and about 20 % of employees were full or half-blood gipsies . 
  race has never been brought up in any argumentation and they were treated equally . 
  they were working as hard as other employees and were not paid less then others . 
  these people were willing to work and their everyday life was not different than of hungarians . 
  hugs ? 
  i think orban wants to keep the fence regardless of germany 's willingness of accepting refugees . 
  it is his holy crusade against the `` muslim invaders '' . 
  he is like , not again moh\u00e1cs !, 
  meh , we keep nazing , got used to that we can not do anything pleasant for western eyes . 
  i would laugh loud on your sarcasm if i would not be afraid of drowning from my tears . 
  and germany has about [ 3000 % gdp ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28germany+gdp%29%2f%28hungary+gdp%29 ) of hungary . 
  just saying . 
  unless they destroy the empty boats _ before _ they leave the harbors in libya , i see no point in this . 
  the boats were used only once and often sunk intentionally at the sight of the eu patrol ships . 
  or , just an important piece of information is missing . 
  was n't that germany has limited the immigration of workers from eastern europe for the longest possible time allowed by eu law ? 
  like , 7 years , between 2004 and 2011 ? 
  what if they try again the next day ? 
  i like that pilsudski guy . 
  i see him every weekend when i pass [ this ] ( https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/eml\u00e9kt\u00e1bl\u00e1k_budapest_xii._ker\u00fclet\u00e9ben#/media/file:j\u00f3zef_pilsudski_eml\u00e9kt\u00e1bl\u00e1ja_xii_ker\u00fclet_apor_vilmos_t\u00e9r_2.jpg ) a few hundred meters from where i live . 
  you 're welcome in hungary . 
  i want to live to the day ( and more  when romanians and hungarians consider each other good friendly neighbors . 
  anyhow if you ever happen to visit budapest , the first palinka is on me !, 
  there is a missing piece of information for you : the reason why hungary , for example , has such low approval rate . 
  in fact by the time ( that may take longer than in sweden , perhaps weeks ) the authorities want to hand over the approved asylum papers , the refugees alreqdy left the country . 
  so they are not counted in . 
  it is not that , for example , 90 % of syrians are rejected . 
  they just leave the country before the asylum process finishes . 
  so please consider this before you use that approval rate statistics in argumentation . 
  i think you summarized this well . 
  but now this rings me a bell in parallel to the greek crisis . 
  i remember that greeks kept saying the same : it is not clear what germany expects them to do and they try to do whatever was told them , possibly even more . 
  i do not claim if they were right or not , but it is what i heard saying . 
  so in this sense , i do not expect that germany or eu , would make a set of clear statements what hungary is supposed to do . 
  i think they expect us to clean up our shit , come up with a plan that is humane and feasible . 
  just asking , what if serbia would just stop transporting _ all _ migrants to the hungarian border , but could move part of it towards other borders so romania , hungary and croatia could share the load ? 
  i have already started to design a gps module with geofencing addon . 
  i want to get it certified then it can be just used with any hobby project . 
  do you want to cooperate , 
  this is a surprisingly sensible and sane proposal . 
  the news here are full of dos and donts what can we do to help immigrants . 
  in fact transporting them if you know that they are illegal migrants ( registered but not present at the registration camp or not registered ) may land you in jail for smuggling . 
  giving them food and medication is ok though . 
  [ the beatings will continue till the morale improves ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/talk%3athe_beatings_will_continue_until_morale_improves ), 
  certainly it is not the first measure one is taking . 
  i did not explain the details of the case because it is off topic and would not add to the original comment . 
  if you are interested pm me and can tell you the story . 
  depends on the job . 
  in a team of 20 programmers you just can not afford that an opinion maker openly talking shit about the company he is working for . 
  it is tearing apart the fine bonds of a well working team . 
  the latter . 
  when i was a manager of 20 , there were always one or two guys who just did not play according to the rules . 
  then hr has drawn me a chart like this : 1 . 
  if they are motivated and performing well - appreciate and encourage them . 
  if they are motivated but not performing well - mentor and encourage them . 
  if they are not motivated and not performing well - check your possibilities or terminate them . 
  if they are not motivated and perform well - then you have the most dangerous situation with opinion makers respected by the team who are working against you . 
  if this is not changing then just fire them . 
  as i see britain is in the 4th category . 
  it does not matter what we do , we are accused . 
  if we try to apply the eu immigration laws with the scarce resources that we have then we are evil not letting them go . 
  if we let them go then we are evil for not guarding the borders properly . 
  i think the only acceptable solution for the west would be if we transform hungary to a big refugee camp and deal with all refugees here . 
  fingerprints in ~ ~ hungary ~ ~ greece - nope ftfy, 
   anyone looking a bit like a syrian will claim to be syrian , even without proof . 
  i do not know how germany is checking this , but in hungary , they are questioned one by one ( somewhat ) thoroughly to see if they are lying about their origin . 
  they get questions about the history , geography and politics of their supposed home country . 
  ah yes , and they are questioned by native speakers . 
  luckily it 's not audism . 
  it has a temporary hungarian license plate according to the [ hungarian press ] ( http://index.hu/kulfold/2015/08/27/otven_halott_migranst_talaltak_ausztriaban_egy_furgonban/ ) the license was bought by a romanian citizen in the town kecskemet , that is about 80kms from the serbian border . 
  yes . 
  he was born in budapest also attended school in hungary . 
  his wife was hungarian too . 
  later they emigrated to the us and neumann has made his nobel winning theories in the states . 
  hungarians are still extremely proud of him . 
  something is not complete here . 
  hungarian government is claiming that hu is the first registrar of these refugees , ten thousands of people so far this year . 
  the biggest fear of our government is that once the wealthy western countries will just say thats enough and mass-deport these people back to the first registrar country and that its hungary . 
  but if the migration path takes these guys ten days thru greece , then how is that they are not registered there ?
