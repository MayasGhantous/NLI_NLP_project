  i just do n't get if the hungarian government is playing coy here or that greece is not registering a large percentage of the migrants crossing its territory a week ? 
  i demand bailout !, 
  hungary is arranging several charity missions to ukraine , especially to the zakarpattia region . 
  in several interviews with the charity organizers they said that when they asked the people what they need , if its food or clothes or anything , the response was : well we have everything in the shops , it is just very expensive . 
  so do not send us food but send us money . 
  this was last year , so i am certain that the situation is much worse now . 
  czech : [ closely watched trains ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/closely_watched_trains ) german : [ das boot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/das_boot ) norwegian : [ nord ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1252610 ), 
  maybe it is just me , but i do not understand the [ funeral sermon and prayer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/funeral_sermon_and_prayer ) nor the [ lamentations of mary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lamentations_of_mary ) in old hungarian . 
  some words look similar but i had to cheat by reading the contemporary translation to get any sense of the texts . 
  i remember that this has been already proposed years ago by someone . 
  and i somewhat understand your national pride . 
  i hope you believe that i have no personal interest in buying greek islands , but am curious why do you think some rocks worth the hunger and poverty of millions ? 
  islands . 
  think of russia selling alaska when they ran out of money . 
  means `` jam '' ? 
  perhaps it 's true in certain conditions , but in case of desperate needs the process can be significantly hastened . 
  if you see the [ hyperinflation in zimbabwe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hyperinflation#zimbabwe ) then it is clear that they have pressed new type of banknotes almost every month . 
  i rather doubt that they have prepared for this for years . 
  some [ langos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/l%c3%a1ngos ), 
  why do n't you build more apartment complexes / houses around the larger cities ? 
  if there is demand and market , it pays off to invest in building . 
  serious question . 
  yes we do . 
  click on the link in the post for the original article . 
  according to google translate it has a chapter about americans , too . 
  in fact omv did the same with their 21 % share in hungarian mol . 
  omv sold it to surgutneftegas . 
  it has cost lots of money for the hungarian government to buy back the share from the russia owned petrol company . 
  omv sold it for 1.4 b eur in 2009 and the hu govt bought it back in 2011 for 2.7 b eur , so kind of double price . 
  edit : added price info, 
  how much percentage of romania 's energy market is controlled by petrom ( or now omv ) ? 
  do you consider it acceptable that omv , partially owned by the austrian state , has a key control over romania 's energy market ? 
  i am really interested in your opinion . 
  the same happened to mol in hungary , in both positions : omv has owned significant share in mol but eventually was forced to sell its share because the hungarian government did not like that another countries interest could influence its petrol prices . 
  but again , mol has did the same with the croatian ina , pissing off the croatian government . 
  so how is this seen in romania ? 
  hugs ... ? 
  i understand that it is not about made-in-europe hardware , but i am still interested whether any of these gear was designed or manufactured in europe ? 
  at first glance it looks none of them , which is pity :(, 
  lets attack austria and then quickly resign and let them annex us . 
  i knew that someone will bring up countries with lonely languages that does not appear to have this problem . 
  this is why i mentioned that it is just one aspect of the many . 
  no question about that the education system 's preference for languages , the history and the ethnical diversity of a country play major role too . 
  in the defense of my country , that is always performing the worst in these comparisons . 
  almost all european languages are the part of a language family that makes learning the similar languages easier . 
  this is not the case in hungary , we are pretty orphaned in terms of language in the middle of europe . 
  so there is no `` easy pick '' for us . 
  this is certainly just one aspect of the issue , but in my opinion plays a major role . 
  for example , when czechs and slovaks claim they know 2.2 and 2.5 languages respectively , would you consider that they speak significantly more language than hungarians with 1.5 ? 
   we might be able to keep them in the outer states . 
  oh how nice solution that you forged . 
  cheers from the `` outer states '' . 
  it is expected to be above 1 % by end of the year . 
  wish you were in schengen , then we could share the load . 
  it is listed on the croatian , slovenian and romanian and hungarian top10 too . . 
  i guess all of those countries were blessed with that shitty tv series . 
  thanks . 
  your food is ok too , but can confirm only [ indirectly ] ( http://aragvi.hu/index.php/en/ ) . 
  its not about witch hunting . 
  hungary wants to forge advantage of marketing its agriculture gmo free , with hope that there will be always sufficient market for such products across europe . 
  austria is doing the same . 
  tell us more about this . 
  poland . 
  eat pierogi and drink vodka with pickled cucumber . 
  also visit krakow and ~ ~ danzig ~ ~ gdansk for history . 
  avoid football matches . 
  edit : fixed city name, 
  i do not know why you have been downvoted . 
  it sounds harsh , but it is proven working . 
  perhaps more examples exist , but i know of two : in romania until 90 's and in hungary in the 50 's there was a ban on abortion and birth control was deprectaed in general . 
  the result was a baby boom in both countries . 
  i may suspect that hungary 's orban 's devotion to religion has the same motivation : as it looks religious people produce more children in average . 
  on the other hand i consider both option as rude intrusion in my privacy . 
  i am not baptized . 
  i feel the weight of the future of my country on my shoulders ... 
  hungary has registered partnership for couples of same sex , too . 
  legislated in 2009 . 
  the related law regulates legal items like inheritance , asset sharing when the couple splits , including the location of child . 
  but apparently guardian knows it better . 
  updated sources provided information what orban said in reply : `` hello , arch duke ! '' . 
  according to orban they call each other `` dictator '' and `` arch duke '' since years . 
  patience . 
  if its besond repairable then hungary will get ( lease ) a replacement plane . 
  however , as bad it looks , some experts commented on the pictures that it still may be possible to rebuild the plane . 
  the accident is very unfortunate anyhow :(, 
  also very old data source . 
  lists mdf that did not exists at all since years ... 
  by the time western europe will be lost , we will be the last hope of what we call now european culture . 
  be nice with the brits begging you for let them in , 
  we are flying under radar ... 
  considering that the deaf sign language of someone from hungary is to put your finger under your nose , pretending having mustache , yes . 
  how about stereotypes about our gloominess ? 
  i think its true , too . 
  same in hungarian . 
  growing up with a mother tongue that makes no difference between `` he '' and `` she '' you often hear hungarians struggling and mixing up genre references while talking e.g. 
  english . 
  in detective stories however it is really good that you can write about the murder till the very end of the story without revealing if its a male or female , 
  nothing , really . 
  i like the antennas on the roof of the unit . 
  guess whom the priests are talking to ... ?
