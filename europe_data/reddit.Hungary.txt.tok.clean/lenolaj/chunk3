  and so what ? 
  sure those mafia bandits that are `` friends '' of mother russia like ramzan kadirov are so much better . 
   why should i feel sympathy for the serbs , of all nations that suffered perceived injustices throughout history ? 
  see as a hungarian i do n't really do feel for them , they massacred at least 40,000 hungarian civilians in vojvodina at the end of ww2 , often brutally torturing them , like impalement etc. 
  in my opinion most orthodox slavic peoples ( russians and serbians at least ) are really pathetic losers full of butthurt and false bravado , fake masculinity , they also think that they were the only ones who were victims of injustices throughout history , that they were always on the `` good '' side and that the evil western world is so , so ungrateful for their supposed good deeds . 
  maybe only arabs beat them in that regard . 
  so i 'd say serbs had it coming , that 's what you get when you 're starting a war to keep together an empire ( the former yugoslavia ) or at least to create a greater serbia , then losing 4 wars in 10 years and also when you count on mother russia as your big brother that will protect you from the evil west . 
  the result was as one might expect now they do n't laugh . 
  neither did all those arab countries who counted on the same with soviet union/russia . 
  well to be honest all nationalisms work similarly , we are still butthurt about the treaty of trianon and it 's consequences , we also think that we were always victims and/or heroes etc. 
  we have smoking , old-timer , happy end too . 
  speaker - radio or tv announcer or sports commentator winchester - hard drive ( once-common generic name in english too , from the name for an early ibm hdd ), 
  it has less to do with religion than politics and nationalism . 
  in transylvania they build those orthodox churches on szekler land and other formerly hungarian lands because they want to prop up their historical claim to the territory . 
  they build an orthodox church here and there , next day they say to foreign visitors : `` see here is this 500 year old romanian church , we are ancient here this was always ours , we were here before the hungarians it 's the proof . '', 
   the people of south ossetia want independence so did the chechens . 
  well it can be changed if the left-liberal opposition manages to unite and form a voting bloc larger than fidesz 's that is not impossible at all . 
  at least theoretically . 
  problem is that the opposition politicians are widely discredited , one of its the leaders is the previous pm who did a good job according to many , but is remembered for drastic austerity measures and such by the voters ( also the tragicomical circumstances of him taking office in 2009 ) . 
  also he is a long time friend of his predecessor gyurcs\u00e1ny , who is even more discredited in the eyes of the wide majority of the population . 
  the socialists are led another longtime gyurcs\u00e1ny friend mesterh\u00e1zy who is small beer so to speak . 
  so the cause why many think that fidesz ca n't be ousted next year democratically is that most of the opposition is a thoroughy discredited bunch , with politicians who lost their credibility to many people . 
  the ruling party losts quite much of its supporters , but most of them does n't want to vote for the left opposition either . 
  without some unexpected upheaval , the turnout will be low probably and the opposition seems to already accepting the defeat , and is preparing for the next term in opposition . 
  or it seems so . 
  well this article is n't even new , it 's from may . 
  basically we 've seen a wave of articles in the foreign media often making ridiculously overblown claims , and obviously written by clueless people , who seemingly do n't know shit about hungary , do n't speak hungarian at all ( of course that 's understandable , it 's very difficult to learn ) . 
  they actually help the government here at home ( while of course they damage its reputation - and the whole country with it - abroad ) because they are so ridiculously over the top and full of factual inaccuracies and are often wholly beside the point when they attack the govt . 
  they seemingly try to trick the clueless foreign audience into believing wholly in something that 's not really here . 
  at least from the viewpoint of the average hungarian it seems so . 
  while they largely ignore the real problems like rampant corruption , cronyism and nepotism etc. 
  highly sensationalist , propagandistic attacks in foreign media against the government make people to think that there is indeed a foreign conspiracy against hungary ( and its government ) , because they seemingly confirm that there is a paid smear campaign going on . 
  supporters of the government may say `` well , does n't this reinforce that orban is doing good for us and the country , and that is why those foreigners are so upset about him and spread such blatant lies about hungary ? 
  poor brainwashed foreigners ... '' etc. 
  for now i smoke belarusian cigarettes called fest ( \u0444\u044d\u0441\u0442 . . or 7 \u0444\u044d\u0441\u0442 ? 
  there is a number 7 in the logo above '' \u0444\u044d\u0441\u0442 '' ) . 
  of course bought `` under the counter '' as they are smuggled here . 
  well it 's because of historical reasons . 
  i think many slovaks like hungary though because i see a lot of your compatriots driving around here , they usually have nice cars ( mostly from komarno ) . 
   ( of course i 'm joking , it 's because of our car registration tax , many evade it going `` slovakian '' ), 
  `` there seems to be an aversion to air conditioning , laundromats and cloth dryers in this country , i miss these things . '', 
  air conditioning is expensive , we are a relatively poor country , many people and small venues could n't afford having one ( because of the electricity bill too ) but it 's more common than say 10 years ago . 
  even some newer buses and trams are having ac now , that was unheard of in the 90 's . 
  do you have laundromats in belgium ? 
  i thought that is mainly a us/north american thing . 
  there are some washing and dry-cleaning shops in budapest though that they are far between . 
  they were more common in the `` commie '' era when there was a state chain of them ( only in budapest ) called [ patyolat ] ( http://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/f%c5%91v%c3%a1rosi_patyolat_v%c3%a1llalat ) . 
  ( apparently there are still [ two ] ( http://www.patyolat.hu/?p=menu&amp;i=7 ) existing shops under that name ) . 
  summers became this scorching hot in the last decade , maybe global warming is real after all . 
  it 's interchangeable with szervusz/szevasz/szasz but i think it 's dubious that it 's the shortened form . 
  i always thought that it 's from see ya , but apparently [ linguists do n't necessarily ageee ] ( http://www.nyest.hu/hirek/tenyleg-angol-szo-a-szia ) , 
  the us constitution does n't allow such thing , the hungarian constitution allowed that a two-thirds majority in parliament can change the constitution . 
  and fidesz gained two-thirds of the seats so they have the full power to do it legally . 
  it was n't some kind of coup or enabling act 1933 germany style . 
  so it was done legally . 
  the previous constitution was also `` undemocratic '' , as it was technically the old communist constitution but amended beyond recognition . 
  it was n't approved by popular vote either so it did n't reflect the `` will of the people '' any more than the current one . 
  actually compared to the first-past-the-post system of the us and uk the rules are still fairer . 
  it can be said that they `` gerrymandered '' the voting districts , but that is a common practice in the us too ( and it 's done much more blatantly there , with totally weird looking districts sometimes , we do n't have those ) . 
  i agree with your assessment except that it 's worse . 
  i 'd like to see more politicians like erdogan , putin , berlusconi , sarkozy our our orban ( despite that i do n't agree with everything they do ) . 
   boring bureaucrats are boring . 
  politicians with balls are more entertaining . 
  never used or seen one . 
  apparently the conquerors were n't mongoloid either . 
  it was a tribal federation that included a few mongoloid types ( including the leaders ) , but the majority were `` european '' type people . 
  `` szia '' is `` see ya '' from english . 
  but hungarians did n't know what it means so we use it as a greeting too ( also we can use `` hello '' when parting somebody ) . 
  yeah i did n't mention the accented letters those are regarded as separate letters of the alphabet . 
  in hungarian we clearly differentiate between the vowel in `` sajt '' and `` sojt '' ( ok no such word exist , then take `` rojt '' ) english does n't really consider those different sounds . 
   41 % consider the state an enemy , 43 % consider it a friend cool , that 's better than i would have thought . 
  to be honest it seems you like us more than the other way around , 
  hungarian alphabet is phonetic , but the sounds are marked differently than in any other language , that can be confusing to foreigners . 
  `` gy '' is like soft d in russian ( `` dy '' ) similarly `` ty '' is soft t , `` ny '' is soft n. all are common sounds in hungarian . 
  `` ly '' is `` y '' like `` yellow '' ( also `` j '' in hungarian , the same sound , originally `` ly '' was pronounced differently ( soft `` l '' ? ), 
  but not now ) other consonants : `` sz '' is `` s '' , `` s '' is `` sh '' , `` cs '' is `` ch '' . 
  vowels : `` a '' and `` e '' sounds differently than in most languages , `` a '' is heard as an unstressed `` o '' by english speakers , `` e '' is maybe closest to german '' \u00e4 '' etc. 
  until the collapse of socialism it kind of worked but after that ... industries and economic sectors that needed a lot of unskilled laborers collapsed and most of them became steadily unemployed . 
  many kids growing up now never seen their parents to work . 
  from canada too . 
  yeah palatschinke was always associated with the plattensee in my mind , not budapest . 
  ( there are palacsinta places in budapest too , but not every 50 meters of course ), 
  yes , i know about that , just said that there was n't much resistance there at that point ( when the germans arrived ) . 
  the hungarian , bulgarian and italian participation was mostly token forces ( like the numerous `` allies '' beside the us and britain in iraq ) , the wehrmacht was the serious part . 
  also yugoslavia was an artificial country with serious separatist aspirations back then already , that did n't help them either . 
  in the eyes of many croats , slovenes etc. 
  the germans were liberators back then . 
  as a hungarian * the events after wwi when our country did n't even try seriously to defend the territories ( i mean those that had significant hungarian population ) , that were to be ceded to our newly created ( and old ) neighboring states . 
  instead socialists took power who used pacifist slogans , practically disbanded the remains of the army , and blindly hoped that the `` civilized west '' will make a just peace based on wilson 's principles etc. 
  ( well , they did , just they had drawn the borders so that it was always on the hungarians ' expense ) . 
  then the commies took over , proclaimed a `` soviet republic '' , and they actually tried to put up a fight , but the `` red army '' they created crumbled after a few initial successes against the czechoslovaks , because the officers ( and enlisted men too ) began to desert it after the commie government gave in to the entente 's demands and withdrew from the territory taken back from the czechoslovaks ( they did n't incorporate it officially but proclaimed a `` slovak soviet republic '' there actually . 
  ( after that , the better led and much better armed romanian army vanquished the already disintegrating red army and occupied the whole hungary , the commies fled , admiral horthy 's troops entered budapest after the romanians withdrew etc. ), 
  so i think the failure was ours , we have primarily ourselves to blame . 
  * the jewish laws and the holocaust in wwii but i think i do n't have to elaborate that now . 
  * the last 20-25 years also , we ca n't be proud of ourselves for that either . 
  we were regarded the most westernized former communist country , but now , as they say `` first shall be last '' . 
  at least compared to poland , czech rep. and slovakia we were left far behind . 
  and this is the last 100 years only ... , 
  well the solution was always so that we did suffer , and never the other way around ( after trianon the remaining hungary was well over 90 % hungarian , of course counting german and jewish people too who self-identified as hungarian and were quite assimilated ) . 
  but of course we were losers and did n't manage to put up a good fight even for our land ... instead even a part of our intellectual elite thought that gambling all the chances on bolshevism ( i.e that a commie world revolution will happen soon ) is a good idea , so it kind of was deserved .
