oh , thanks , i did n't look close enough . 
  if i 'm not seeing it wrong : richest person in bulgaria , and moldova : - $ 500 million ? 
  it 's not like they have cheated or anything like that . 
  but the parliament changed countless of laws so that the election would suit the ruling party . 
  for example fidesz would n't have reached even close a 2/3rd majority again if the same electoral laws and rulings would have been placed as they were 4 years ago . 
  i 'm not , but thanks , that 's just like saying new york times is an anti-government agency . 
  this is the first article i posted anyways , the other one was a translation from bits of a speech by orb\u00e1n , which i made personally . 
  maybe you do n't know much about the history in this region , but hungary lost the territory 90 years ago , not `` centuries '' ago . 
  we actually had a big part back , with it 's hungarian population in the second world war as well . 
  as far is i know they call the historians call the millions of hungarians over there ethnic hungarians, 
  that is so stupid that they turned you away . 
  not only have you proved that you have worked for the hungarian society and state , you seem to have proven to you are smart . 
  and we 're turning away the brains , no logic in that . 
  i 'm not exactly sure . 
  in hungary we had the parliamentary elections in the spring so they could only vote on parties , just like any other hungarians living inside the country . 
  we 'll have the local governmental elections in the autumn , how they 'll be able to vote there i have no idea . 
  i apologize in the name of the hungarian police for that . 
  they are very corrupt , not only towards foreigners but towards anywhere they can extort money from . 
  this happens in almost every eastern european country as well though . 
  i just wrote this in another thread a couple of minutes ago : hungarians in transylvania , southern slovakia and serbia can get hungarian nationality if they speak hungarian and they prove that they have hungarian ancestors . 
  in total there are about 3 million hungarians living in those countries . 
  the government made it secret how many people applied and received dual citizenship , so that no one would know how many people could vote for them . 
  it is very easy to receive hungarian nationality nevertheless : in serbia for 300 $ you can become an eu citizen without speaking hungarian and finding one person in your ancestors who has a hungarian name , of course i 'm talking about corruption here . 
  in slovakia it 's the hardest because if i 'm not mistaken those people who applied to become hungarian nationals lost their slovakian identity card immediately , so not many people applied for it . 
  edit : when i said hungarian ancestors i did n't mean that they have to have hungarian ancestors who have lived within the current hungarian borders , but it historical bigger hungary . 
  so basically if you find a great-great grandmother who has a hungarian name that is enough .

  yes , and it 's not like we have actually changed the people in power who have archived that growth . 
  exactly the same people and parties are grasping for power today who were there in 1998 . 
  apart from jobbik . 
  it was much harder for hungarians who left hungary because of economic reasons these last few years to vote , than it was for the hungarian minority living in transylvania , but who have for the most part never livid in hungary . 
   unless you 're not an ethnic hungarian i can assure you that foreigners are not in any treated better or worse than they were 10 years ago . 
  check any statistics : budapest is one of the safest places in europe for foreigners ( far safer than brussels and stockholm where i lived so far ) . 
  we rely heavily on tourism , why would we be unwelcoming ? 
  it is very unfortunate for anyone to think that we are n't a welcoming country , with very friendly people in it towards foreigners . 
  i would n't even want to ask the question if you have ever been here since i strongly suspect the answer . 
  after all the romanian flair people saying `` let 's invade them again '' i salute this question . 
  it 's unfortunate that a minority behaves like that in such a beautiful country . 
  hard question . 
  `` where we 'll end up ? '', 
  i guess you mean the future , so about 6-7 years from now . 
  orb\u00e1n 's support is shrinking comparing to 4 years ago when he won a clear 2/3rd majority . 
  today he could only archieve that with giving passports to hungarian minorities in neighbouring countries for votes . 
  more than 90 % of the people wo got handed passports voted for him . 
  ironically the hundreds of thousands of people who have left hungary to work abroad , had it much harder to cast their votes , since the majority would n't have given their support for fidesz . 
  in a personal opinion i think people who have n't lived in our country ever should n't be able to decide for as . 
  here i 'm talking to the minority . 
  in hungary , i think it was 2003 or something like that there was a popular vote if we should hand passports to the hungarian people abroad and the voters ** rejected ** it . 
  just to point out that this issue ( which unfortunately can cause problems in the relations of our countries in the future ) is made by a party which accumulated such power that it could decide on it alone , even though the majority of the population has proven that it 's against it . 
  fidesz could also only get this amount of popularity with constant propaganda from tv channels that investors close to him bought , the national radio station , and even the free newspaper you get at the metro entrance . 
  the independent european committee which observed the election said that the elections were n't illigitimate but favoured fidesz . 
  fidesz also changed the electoral law comparing to 4 years ago , and only with that they would n't have reached 2/3rds again . 
  but even with that they were ** one ** seat short of the majority so they changed a law to reach that one seat . 
  tells you a lot about todays democratic hungary . 
  i have n't really answered the question until now but i say it : in 5 years either hungary will become a more nationalistic leaning ever more towards authoritarian rule , or people will wake up and bring it down to pieces just as it happened to the left in 2006 . 
  it 's in the hands of the students , and budapest . 
  fidesz does n't or barely has a majority in the capital any more . 
  yes , well , that 's terrible for the future . 
  the population is getting older + many young people are immigrating so it will be really hard to pay the pension . 
  i 'm sorry for not being clear enough . 
  ** corruption was huge before as well you 're right . 
  ** i can give a specific example here that would be impossible to happen in any country in the euopean union , and unprecedented in hungary . 
  orb\u00e1n is a big football fans . 
  stadiums are being built and renovated by tax payers money . 
  he built a football academy in his own village , which now has a team in the first division . 
  the stadium he built by the `` many supporters who gave money '' looks like this : [ 1688 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/felcs%c3%bat ) ( in 2004 ) people live in the village ( including orb\u00e1n and his family . 
  the stadium has [ 4500 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pancho_arena ) spectator places . 
  the investors built a brand new training ground as well , that was completely funded by tax payers money . 
  felcs\u00fat is now the center of hungarian football . 
  in my opinion this is state sponsored corruption , at least the gyurcs\u00e1ny clan tried to hide it . 
  the money flowing to them were maybe equal to what goes today to orb\u00e1n and his friends , but at least they were scandals when gyurcs\u00e1ny was in power . 
  no scandal has happened during anyone in orb\u00e1n 's government , when someone got caught . 
  i got out of hand as well , i apologize . 
  orb\u00e1n was there since the beginning , he was in power from 1998-2002 , is n't he part of the old guard as well ? 
  what 's your opinion on that ? 
  thank you very much for you stupidity in saying `` rich kid travelling the world '' when you do n't know anything about me . 
  but to make you think highly of yourself , of being able to psychoanalyze people from comments made on the internet , yes i belong to the middle ( if there is such any more ) class in hungary but could n't have called myself that abroad . 
  ** are the people who left hungary for a better life abroad because of they could n't find jobs rich spoiled people ? 
  ** i respect and understand you opinion , i just disagree with everything you say . 
  when i think of hungarian politics i see that one of them is a dog and the other one is a barking animal . 
  same thing . 
  but i 'd choose corruption over corruption with nationalism , however sad that might be . 
  those are the only two options out there right now . 
  thank you for that information !, 
  yes !, 
  always the first talking point when we meet each other !, 
  i have many swedish friends , and i know about the history with finland . 
  they also said that somehow norway manipulated sweden somehow to break away ? 
  yes , the media outlets the investors bought , sorry for the `` shut down of the sites '' . 
  i read that this week the government shut down about ten sites but i do n't know what kind they were , but www.kuruc.info stayed online . 
  i do n't buy this whole thing that we ca n't shut it down because it 's hosted in usa . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  with today 's technology we could easily suspend it 's activity , there is just not the will , because it would anger the jobbik supporters i guess . 
  neither the left shut it down when they had the power .
