  yes that 's exactly what we should do . 
  i think there is potential in people who are born after communism to create a new political option to the status quo . 
  germany did n't lose close to as much territory as hungary . 
  i think even bulgaria lost more after the first world war . 
  you 're right about sweden though , and i 'm still surprised how well they managed , all though they last finland and aland much before the first world war if i 'm not mistaken . 
  still about half the country . 
  it 's very difficult to say . 
  we can take the example of the biggest news websites , www.index.hu or www.origo.hu . 
  this is where most people go to get the everyday news . 
  right after the orb\u00e1n took power in 2010 these things happened in `` index '' : in 2010 bod\u00f3ky tam\u00e1s investigative journalist left , and shortly after the leading publicist bede m\u00e1rton . 
  in 2011 september the editor in chief left , because of the growing political influence ( pursued by the owners ) . 
  i found this on the hungarian wikipedia page of the site , which used [ this ] ( http://index.hu/belfold/2011/09/05/uj_peter_tavozik_az_indextol/ ) and [ this ] ( http://www.kreativ.hu/media/cikk/mi_folyik_az_indexnel ) as sources . 
  in no way is index a fidesz mouthpiece , it is very critical of both the government and the opposition . 
  i look at it the way facebook manipulated the news feed negatively without people noticing . 
  just a month ago many people at origo , including the editor in chief left , after they tried to uncover a corruption scandal by a powerful member of the fidesz party . 
  you can read about it [ here ] ( http://www.freehungary.hu/index.php/56-hirek/2939-politically-motivated-sacking-of-origo-editor-in-chief-triggers-protest-in-downtown-budapest ) , found an article in english . 
  origo and index are almost exactly the same . 
  the journalists who left index have already set up a quite independent website which is gaining strength , and the origo staff who left are doing the same thing . 
  i think internet society is quite powerful in the country , most demonstrations are organized on facebook as well . 
  i have repeatedly said that the left before him was economically as bad as orban 's government . 
  and yes i 'm biased . 
  i am 22 , i lived 5 years in belgium , 5 years in sweden , 1 year in france and traveled throughout europe , north america and africa . 
  i lived exactly half my life in hungary . 
  i moved back 2 years after orb\u00e1n took the power . 
  at 20 years old living abroad , apart from visiting a few times i could only read the news , and i supported him , i believed in him . 
  but coming back , and living here showed me the true nature of this regime . 
  democracy is at stake here . 
  `` that 's what putin would say '' . 
  that 's what putin says about internal opposition as well ( foreign funded people ) , read any of his speeches . 
  do n't understand why you have to pick on that . 
  i doubt there is a single eu leader who has said anything like this so far . 
  i did n't call him dictator , i called orb\u00e1n a `` nationalistic politican with dictatorial tendencies '' . 
  he is not a dictator , but in my opinion if it were only up to him he 'd much rather have the powers putin has than merkel . 
  prove me otherwise of the things he has done , or said so far , in any of his speeches inside hungary . 
  `` the very reason fidesz is in power is because the former mszp pm , gyurcs\u00e1ny 's scandalous speech '' absolutely right , and the 2/3rd majority is because of that reason as well . 
  orb\u00e1n was in power 1998-2002 and he did n't do such a good job either before did he ? 
  and i 'm not blaming everything on orb\u00e1n , i 'm blaming myself , my friends and the hungarian population . 
  i 'm raising awareness abroad , i ca n't apologize for that . 
  you 're right . 
  i do n't think there is a possibility for a civil war , it would be no good for anyone . 
  this whole issue is to sensitive to most hungarians , and this current government is using it as `` we stand up for our people '' kind of thing . 
  it 's very sad . 
  as i said before i 'd like the eu to take a role in solving this issue , and end the yearly diplomatic wars . 
  i live in a small town right now just outside of budapest . 
  the local government recently hired workers ( who were ironically gypsies ) to build two things in the town square . 
  5 benches with the big hungarian map engraved in it like [ this ] ( http://www.cimexchange.com/blog/61/entry-234-the-plan/ ) one . 
  and a big copy of a [ gate ] ( http://tourinform.hu/site/upload/2010/11/18_szekely_kapu.jpg ) the hungarian minority usually has in transylvania . 
  i would like to emphasize that this is a completely normal suburban town , where the local government is fidesz . 
  this is nothing to do with `` hungarian values '' only with spiking up the nationalism , and nostalgia towards the past . 
  thanks for pointing that out . 
  i was n't sure about fico 's political views , just thought it because of what i could remember from the news during his coalition with slota . 
  drama queens or not , when 2/3rd of your country is taken away by a single decision ( 1920 treaty of trianon ) , there are going to be huge problems . 
  i 'm convinced the radicalism , nationalism is there because of how we handled that decision . 
  how do you think usa would be today if it had lost most of it infrastructure , 2/3rd of the country , and half the population ? 
  what 's happening today is entirely because of history . 
  we ca n't let that deicision go , and it 's hard when almost every single family has members living in neighboring countries because of a decision of the french , usa and england ( that 's why some believe in international conspiracy ) . 
  there is a reason for this `` drama queens '' , but if you find me another country which got handed a similar dicision in the past 100 years but became a liberal democracy like pherhaps sweden i 'll jump off a tower . 
  it 's very hard , but in no way have we done a good job either . 
  just saying this because if you say `` it 's not that important '' to any hungarian , he 'll think you 're a dumb ass . 
  yes i know about belarus 's problems . 
  well hungarians in the means of majority of the population , thinks belarus is a dictatorship . 
  terrible corruption and close ties with russia . 
  i know personally that assad had and still has good relationship with the belorussian government which was surprising . 
  the hungarian government has good relationship with them , as it has with most dictatorships . 
  every year there are leaders from the `` stan '' countries visiting hungary , the only country in europe probably which welcomes them . 
  not sure about the diplomatic realtions between hungary and belarus but in no way are they bad , the economic ties are probably getting closer . 
  good , compared to previous years then . 
  i 've got my hopes up . 
  obviously i mean post-orb\u00e1n . 
  many hungarians see that the communication tools we have used since post-communism has been a disaster for our relations . 
  and if we do n't get our diplomacy sober we 'll be isolated from all of our neighbors . 
  when you write something like this , get the facts checked : orb\u00e1n was in power from 1998-2002 . 
  the economics under the left was just as bad as during the first orb\u00e1n government . 
  from 2008-2010 the left handled the crisis pretty good actually . 
  i do n't want to get into `` who is worse '' nevertheless . 
  as sad as it is , i 'd rather have the left in power for two reasons : - get rid of this nationalistic , conspiracy , `` everyone is against us '' bullshit . 
  - corruption was done by individuals , not allowed by state , as it is now . 
  in my opinion the left is just a tiny-tiny bit better , and in no way good for the country . 
  there needs to be a complete change . 
  i have to disagree here . 
  the majority of hungarians are n't with orb\u00e1n , and many people who voted for him did n't do that because they like him . 
  the turnout was 60 % . 
  out of them 44 % voted for fidesz ( yes with the current laws this government put in place you can get 2/3ed majority without forming a coalition ) . 
  that makes about 27 % of the people eligible to vote , voting for orb\u00e1n . 
  and many , i can say at least 1/3rd of them only voted for him , because in their opinion the left is not better ( insanely corrupt ) . 
  i understand them . 
  lot of the young poeple who voted for the extreme right jobbik voted for them because of the criminality we have inside the country . 
  amost 50 % i would say . 
  not because of the minorities , or because they like nazism . 
  the majority of the population does n't represent this governement , nor it 's opinion . 
  in budapest the party barely , or did n't recieve the majority even . 
  it 's in budapest where the educated you people are . 
  the hungarian minority in romania which voted for fidesz voted for them because they gave them passport , absolutely not because because they agree with their political views . 
  a hungarian living in transylvania pointed that out in a previous comment as well . 
  most of them live in villages or small town , and are old . 
  i do n't think much of them use internet for example . 
  a minority is getting manipulated , they 're not bigger or smaller than in most other european countries . 
  hungarians are democrats . 
  romanian-hungarian relations can become very good in a few years . 
  yes , just did n't want the title to be so biased , that people wo n't open it .
