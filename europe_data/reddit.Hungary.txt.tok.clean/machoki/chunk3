  the ruling party won absolute majority this year with elements putin does to win majority . 
  even with the minority votes ( which i call cheating and not good for the country , nor europe in a whole ) orb\u00e1n changed a law to flip ** one ** seat to his government , thus winning by 2/3rd this year as well . 
  the past 4 years a new oligarchy has been created and become extremely powerful , similar to the pre-war ukraine one . 
  in government institution you e-mails and phone are actively monitored , and even receiving an sms from the political opposition saying `` happy birthday '' can get you fired . 
  happened to a friend in the foreign ministry . 
  they put up cameras inside every government buildings . 
  free press is the worst in the eu . 
  orb\u00e1n has met putin several times , but never obama . 
  jobbik , the radical party is partly getting money from russia . 
  orb\u00e1n shuts down free media sites , but he has n't shut down the biggest radical , jew and gypsy hating site which the radicals use to get the `` news '' . 
  the fidesz signed a nuclear energy deal with russia , without any forehand economic calculations , it 's wort several billions $ and will add to the already huge debt we have . 
  hungary today is closer to russia than any other state in europe . 
  orb\u00e1n is nationalistic with dictatorial tendencies . 
  saying that he sees russia as an `` international superstar '' is n't populistic at all , he wo n't gain many votes with that . 
  i 'll maybe get down voted by slovakians for this , but 8 years ago robert fico led a right-wing governement . 
  he had to do go on coalition , and he had two choices , either the extremist nationalist ( really disliking the 1 million hungarian minority ) jan slota 's party or the hungarian minority 's pary . 
  he choosed jan slota ... jan slota : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%a1n_slota i chose the way to describe jan slota with the words wikipedia uses , so if i get downvoted i welcome them with plesure . 
  the point is that these governement workers , are working not because of orb\u00e1n 's official reason , to create a `` working society '' , but so that they wo n't add to the unemployment numbers . 
  since unfortunately that 's the real reason , the governement does n't really care about them as long as they 're in the database as `` working '' . 
  this makes them do completely useless jobs ( how come we did n't need them to cut grass/build monuments with nationalistic symbols before ? ) . 
  they could do a useful thing , like i read in a post : building infrastructure , train tracks or roads , since most of them are living in the countryside . 
  even working in agriculture or centenary would be a good idea . 
  the reason why they ca n't do that i think is because these things are real jobs , and it would be hard to sell why they pay them so little . 
  thank you , i 'll add it up top . 
  you 're absolutely right . 
  i have lived exactly half my life around western europe and hungary , and i have n't met anyone from any country who think themselves as big victims as many in our country do . 
  absolutely nothing seems to be our fault . 
  - the wars and treaties we went into are because of internarnational conspiricy - - the minorities are treated badly because of our neighbroures who hate us - the economic situation is because of the banks and speculation - noone listens to us in the eu because everyone is against us . 
  these thing orb\u00e1n says clearly in every speech , this are n't some hidden messages . 
  at every speech he makes inside of the country he says these things to gain votes , and it 's working . 
  no one in this fucking country understands that ** we are here because of our own actions , and only we have the power to change it . 
  ** it 's just easier and it brings you votes to blame on foreigners and on the international conspiracy . 
  i 'd rather the eu . 
  and yes we are incapable of getting rid of this political class ( opposition included ) . 
  even if by some miracle we could get rid of orb\u00e1n by demonstrations , the person taking his place would n't be no angel neither knowing us . 
  it 's enough that almost 20 % voted for a party close to being neo nazi ( many of my friends included ) ... 
  yes , there is no legitimate opposition , as i said in a previous comment exactly the same politicians are there who were there 15 years ago as well . 
  opposition included . 
  i did n't even vote for that reason . 
  edit : typing, 
  forgive me if i 'm wrong but politics im serbia change quit fast if i 'm not mistaken ? 
  if i remember correctly you recently had a very nationalistic governement ? 
  do they teach mostly english in school by the way ? 
  cutting grass , maintaining roads things like that . 
  we have a big allergy problem so they 're exterminating the sort of grass causing it . 
  preparing for flooding , cleaning up after it , cutting wood , things like that . 
  most of the communal workers are outside of the big cities ( unemployment is much worse in the countryside ) . 
  well more than every 30th person in the country is working there , and for ridiculous amount of money . 
  apart from monuments , they are n't building anything , mostly cleaning roads and cutting grass , can barely call it a work project , but i guess i 'm wrong . 
  to be honest we have n't had anything like this here since communism , and that was 23 years ago . 
  it 's just so that officially the unemployment rate stays low . 
  edit : typo, 
  what a coincidence !, 
  i 'm just rereading it as well !, 
  his speech came at a perfect time . 
  i 'll give you an example : the government is punishing people who ca n't work . 
  it 's quite hard to write down because i could n't find a term that would suit . 
  officially unemployment is about 10-12 % if i 'm not mistaken . 
  ** but ** there are 330.000 `` state workers '' ( there is a term for this ) . 
  these third of a million are people who work for 140 $ a month cleaning roads , cutting grass , putting up monuments , because if they do n't do that they wo n't recieve social care . 
  in the 330.000 the governement workers ( ministries , hospitals ect . 
  are n't counted ) . 
  these are people who are basically unemployed people not counted in the 12 % . 
  150 $ a month is half the minimal wage , all though i think they only work 4-6 hours a day . 
  i think hitler did the same thing with the unemployment , only he built the autobahn ? 
  more than 90 % of the people who got handed hungarian citizenship voted for him . 
  several hundred thousands of people , it 's a complete game changer . 
  i 've got nothing against hungarians living abroad , but they have absolutely no idea what 's going on here , ** they do n't and never have lived here ** , only their parents . 
  they should have no right deciding who will run the hungarian parliament from slovakia/romania/serbia . 
  b crazy . 
  it just adds on everything that even more tensions were created with neighboring countries because of this . 
  exactly 10 years ago there was a popular vote in hungary if there should be dual citizenship for hungarians living abroad and the ** people voted no ** . 
  this government has accumulated such power that it could decide alone . 
  we 're most likely from the ural mountains in russia . 
  in the governments opinion however we seem to come from wherever there is money , most recently in japan . 
  people might call me stupid but the possibility is there for mass demonstrations . 
  mostly from the university students . 
  but god orb\u00e1n is smart : 2 years ago there was a big student demostration because of the introduction of the students fees . 
  in the end they dug up an old quote from the leader of the demonstrations saying that his decision to enter to politics was because of orb\u00e1n clapping his head as a child . 
  the problem is that not many people speak english here , and it 's very hard to see the facts without that . 
  the potential is there though , almost everyone in my university class detests the governement , but there is noone/nothing to make them ( us ) stand up together . 
  it 's simply more likely that an economic disaster will occur . 
  i do n't know how it is in neighboring countries but exactly the same people are in politics who were there 15 years ago . 
  and people still vote for them . 
  do n't tell me . 
  i could add japan to the list , he did n't say them but visited them a couple of weeks ago and spoke very highly of them . 
  their growth in the last 20 years maybe close to ours even . 
  we also had deflation last quarter . 
  our economy is performing terribly compared to the region . 
  i picked this map comparing every eastern and central european countries growth from 2006-2013 : http://blogs-images.forbes.com/markadomanis/files/2012/06/east-europe-gdp-2006-20131.png hungary is just in front of estonia the media here is being actively censored with many major news outlets either bought by investors close to the government , or by hidden investors which are the same thing . 
  there are 2 weekly outlets left who are independent ( neither left-right ) and provide quality . 
  all tv channels are biased in some way . 
  our economy performed better lately , but the election was in april , so it will take time to see if the gdp is really getting bigger . 
  4 years ago orb\u00e1n promissed 5-7 % but because of `` speculation and foreign banks '' we have to wait for that . 
  the state bought out one of the biggest banks just this week , in a way to further nationalize the economy . 
  my personal opinion in this issue would be that the eu would mediate some kind of solution . 
  i think something has to be done because every year there is an incident . 
  the last that i can remember was the flags we hung up all over the place ( even here in budapest ) that was pure provocation from our part . 
  i doubt a civilized solution can be made with a nationalistic government , and while the radicals here have about 20 % of the votes . 
  glad you only have a few extreme right wingers , that 's big thing looking at todays europe and the economic situation .
