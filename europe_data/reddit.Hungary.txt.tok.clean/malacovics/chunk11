  i have a friend who owns lots of shotguns and pistols , even bolt actons rifles , owned for sport shooting and hunting . 
  yes , and that too . 
  it 's a very long paper work . 
  what do you mean by `` basic permit '' . 
  if you have a permit , you can own it . 
  simple as that . 
  that does n't mean everyone can just easily and cheaply * get * a permit . 
  here in hungary you can own pretty much everything that 's not a destructive device . 
  yet 99 % of the people do n't . 
  why ? 
  because it 's expensive as shit . 
  if not him , than someone else would 've took his place . 
  a leader was needed in the great patriotic war as they call it . 
  even stalin knew he is fucked . 
  he was scared of the russian population post-war . 
  interesting read . 
  i heard he even went paranoid as hell couple of years before his death . 
  history is written by the victor . 
  i know , corny quote , but it 's damn true . 
  well let 's be honest here , stalin did unite russia . 
  his words were sacred to most . 
  the soviets * needed * a figure like that in shitty dire situations like ww2 . 
  what i do n't understand is that people like these still love him . 
  yeah , yeah , defeated the nazis , great . 
  but for fucks sake , killed millions of russians directly . 
  ex-soviet poverty is the best kind of poverty ... 
  do n't ruin it for us, 
  how did syria get more destabilized by reinforcing government forces ? 
  that actually has the opposite effect . 
  the civil war is going on since 2011 . 
  yet the reason why the refugees stared pouring in now is because it 's now a war fought on lots of fronts ( south rebels , north rebels near aleppo and isis on east-northeast ) . 
  there is no longer integrity to the government areas , and people stared fleeing the country in masses . 
  it used to be one huge stagnating frontline on the northeast . 
  not anymore . 
  why not ? 
  not to brag , but i probably know more about wars than most of / r/europe . 
  and it 's funny how everyone downvotes me , but nobody can disprove me . 
  loads of people agree with what i said on / r/combatfootage yet here everyone is butthurt to the max . 
  i 'm not even pro-russian , ** everyone here ** is anti-russian . 
  there is a difference . 
  fine , i 'll take that . 
  it happens . 
  it 's war . 
  sure , it 's easy to shit on combatants when you 're in a safe country . 
   people who are losing their innocent relatives because some rich clown in kremlin wants to prove something to the west . 
  welcome to the real world amigo . 
  where the poor get fucked and the rich rule . 
  the us can go wherever they please and bomb anyone they do n't like . 
  and they do . 
  but again , when russia does , they are suddenly the devil itself . 
  who will want revenge by thousands ? 
  extremist rebels ? 
  as if they would n't want to behead every single non-believer anyways . 
  or the syrians ? 
  why would they ? 
  russia is saving their asses . 
  and when did war * ever * avoid creating bitter people ? 
  you seem to have zero knowledge behind your words . 
  all we know is that they found chemical traces . 
  that 's it . 
  all sides have been pointing at each other for years . 
  none of them can come up with any proof . 
  it 's pointless to argue with this . 
  what the fuck did they expect `` let 's operate a hospital in the middle of a war zone ** what could go wrong '' ** we 'll just blame it on russia . 
  carry on and if you knew anything about the syrian civil war , you 'd know that hospital attacks are pretty much daily events . 
  ever since the very beginning . 
  oh please . 
  we 've been bombing hospitals for years , but nobody bats an eye , because they were used by terrorists as launch sites and ammo depots and hqs . 
  but when russia does it they are literally hitler . 
   assad who used chemical and biological weapons on own people . 
  proof ? 
  oh wait , there 's none . 
  just like the iraqi wmds in 2003 that have magically disappeared * cough * never existed * cough *, 
   the us and nato did n't order assad to start a civil war during the arab spring . 
  but they sure as hell supported it , which made the civil war an awful stalemate , which ultimately led to the massive migration crisis . 
  and let 's be honest here . 
  assad is a massive asshole . 
  but who else is in the area ? 
  jihadist rebel groups ? 
  isis ? 
  out of question . 
  yeah , i 'll stick with assad . 
  strict state control is better than a jihadist caliphate . 
  you 're looking at it from a wrong point of view . 
  they are n't there to make buddies ( like nato tried in afghanistan and failed miserably ) , they are there to keep the syrian government in power . 
  they do n't give a flying fuck about `` kids losing their friends and families '' . 
  and they are a government , a state , not a politically correct liberal politician . 
  why would they ? 
  so what ? 
  they bombed aleppo , not fucking london . 
  aleppo has been in rebel control for * years * and has seen fighting for over ** four ** years . 
  any civilian there has already left ages ago . 
  everyone who remains is definitely not a happy little family . 
  people forget it 's a god damn war out there . 
  * war * . 
  people die in wars . 
  civilians just as much as soldiers , believe it or not . 
  `` b-bbut they bombed a ciityyy maaan !, 
  ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ rebel ^ ^ ^ fortress '', 
  human error always existed and will continue to exist as long as we do .
