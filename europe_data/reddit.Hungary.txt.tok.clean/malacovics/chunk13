   i can not see any single party i could vote for in hungary , neither anywhere else in the eu because no party serves the country , they just serve their own parties ' goals . 
  if they are elected , it is already a job well done for the next 4 years . 
  eh , you tried . 
  not sure i 'd do better with drawing the states . 
  hungary vs. austria ? 
  * it 's 1848 all over again *, 
  love the hungarian road planning . 
  `` let 's send all major routes into budapest , that 'll buff out '' . 
  same applies with trains too , i think . 
  you want to get to the west side of the country from the east ? 
  90 % of the routes take you through budapest where you have to change lines . 
  because slovenia * is * a separatist country ... 1920 never forget !, 
  great . 
  just fucking great . 
  this is literally the goal of the terrorists . 
  they know they will never ever defeat us . 
  so they just turn ourselves against us . 
  ** you lie !, 
  topping putin and obama ? 
  one of them is killed . 
  [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhd7dzjtfcy ) nsfl, 
  one pilot is dead . 
  [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhd7dzjtfcy ) obviously nsfl . 
  just wait until putin sees this . 
  * locks vault doors *, 
  the government officials fail to realize that this is exactly what the terrorists want . 
  never defeat us . 
  they just want to make sure we live in fear for the rest of our lives , and that we ca n't live our normal lives anymore . 
  and it seems it works . 
  public education ? 
  closed . 
  transportation ? 
  i 'm confused ... 
  i ca n't even, 
  onwards polen !, 
  civilians always flee , regardless of the country . 
  not everyone is made to be a fighter . 
  and they held up for what , half a decade now ? 
  seems courageous . 
  syria has couragious people , it 's all over the news , it 's politically important , the us and russia are doing a lot bombing its enemies and russia supplies them with arms . 
  it 's still a totally failed state . 
  but democracy and freedom of speech has a * lot * to do with `` being free '' . 
  in that case , you might want to pay attention to your classes because you 're talking a lot of shit that makes zero sense . 
  yes , you 're absolutely right , but how does that contradict my point ? 
   well if you ask me , the only * truly free * countries are the ones with ** modern air force and cruise missles . 
  ** i 'm , i 'm speechless . 
  as in , what the actual fuck . 
  so i can have a working democracy and freedom of speech , but if i do n't have a modern air force and ** weapons of mass destruction , ** my country is n't free ? 
  pop guess , you 're from rural texas ? 
  i probably just misunderstood you than . 
  and if a country does not have an army , international laws do not apply ? 
  i knew this sub was biased as fuck , but this is downright retarded . 
  so if my country is not a powerful nation , it is free for all ? 
  so you assume just because he pointed out how biased this sub is towards the west , he is an immediate supporter of putin and the war ? 
  no sir , * your * attitude is wrong with this subreddit . 
  and k\u00f6zmunka does not count as work ? 
  do you work ? 
  yes . 
  do you get paid ? 
  yes . 
  than it 's work , and you 're employed . 
  or massively anti-orb\u00e1n / anti-anythingcurrentlyvoted, 
  hmm , we 're doing better than i thought . 
  i thought the same until i started watching it . 
  i 've actually started playing it too , one month in . 
  it 's getting popular in hungary . 
  much more convenient and faster . 
  apparently, 
  we supported the fsa with weapons , training and equipment . 
  but the `` fsa '' nowadays became a group term , since there are dozens of islamic groups in syria now , almost impossible to distinguish who fights for what , and who 's the so called `` moderate '' that we arm . 
  how are they unrelated when the brits and their allies support them ? 
  dam son, 
   just do n't watch tv and vote for the best party you can . 
  but that 's his point . 
  `` best party '' is subjective . 
  he literally hates all parties , in his eyes , there * is no * best party . 
  oh , so creating rebellions , arming and training rebels and conducting airstrikes does not count as `` fighting dictators '' . 
  openly attacking syrian troops on syrian soil already counts as invasion , just saying . 
  what do you think of the syrian reception of a us invasion ? 
  iraqis were super mixed about it too . 
  even if the syrian regime was toppled , it would not be a long lasting fix , as proven by iraq . 
  i would n't call supplying the rebels with thousands of missiles , training and gear `` inaction '' . 
  the fact that we created equally strong sides allowed this war to stagnate and last this long to begin with . 
  and what justifies the us going around killing leaders they do not like ? 
  what justifies them being some kind of self-claimed world police ? 
  you 're literally trying to justify the pointless deaths of thousands of people , by saying that was n't even a whole lot . 
  where do you draw the limit of `` okay , that thousand of people is not okay anymore '' ? 
   we should 've taken out assad directly , back when we had the chance . 
  lol people do n't learn ? 
  `` let 's take out xyz middle eastern dictator , that will solve all our problems ! '', 
  `` ok that sucked , but let 's try this one ! '', 
  `` well that backfired too , but this time , it will change things ! '', 
  why would assad fuck over his regime on purpose ? 
  the us backed fsa rebels started it , for good reasons . 
  in hindsight , i find it retarded though . 
  looking at 2005-era syria , the cities are so beautiful . 
  now they are a bombed wasteland . 
  and knowing how little the world gives a damn about them , they are n't going to be rebuilt anytime soon . 
  that 's because they do n't go through the checkpoints . 
  there are literally thousands crossing the border on a 100-200km line of border .
