  we have lots of policemen , soldiers and drones and what not , but hundreds still slip past the guards . 
  those hundreds do not want to be registered . 
  therefore they riot . 
  maybe because you ca n't prove your point ? 
  they still shot down the aircraft , so they know how to operate it , which is my point . 
  the fact that they are completely retarded is an another topic . 
  i think dealing with a dictator in peace is much more reasonable than dealing with anarchists in total chaos . 
  assad is literally the only thing keeping the dozens of different rebel groups from slicing up syria into their own little realm . 
  if he and his regime falls , like 40 % of syria is open ground for other terrorist/rebel/callthemwhateveryouwant groups . 
  well til . 
  yes . 
  no , but that 's the duty of the mechanics . 
  you 'd be amazed if you knew how simple russian vehicles are . 
  to drive it , you literally have like 2 sticks . 
  if you have a driver 's license , you can pretty much learn to drive a tank in a 3 hour course . 
  the only complicated this is usually the aviation stuff . 
  helicopters , jets , that sort of thing . 
  you could be right . 
  my point is is that going there and getting rid of people we do n't like will just cause more problems in the long run . 
  it 's not that these things are super difficult to operate though . 
  it 's been known for like a decade that russia supports syria . 
  is this news ? 
  nobody likes assad , but he is a necessary evil . 
  removing him like gaddafi wo n't do shit , in fact , it will just escalate the chaos . 
  well good to know , because i was shitting my pants while driving through romania . 
  it 's as if road rules do not apply there . 
  well , this is the problem . 
  there is no * better * . 
  we have nationalists , which all good and nice - but it is n't going to take us anywhere . 
  then we have socialists . 
  as if decades of socialism was n't enough . 
  and lmp ... other than preaching how much others suck , they 've yet to do anything productive . 
  he is a total douchebag morally . 
  but he is a pretty effective politician . 
  and your point is ... 
  he never said all of them are angels . 
  that 's the issue , i 'd say easily 99 % of them are peaceful people . 
  different , problematic ? 
  yes . 
  but peaceful . 
  however , even that 1 % means hundreds or thousands of people . 
  that 1 % is whom everyone fears . 
  we did the same , and things are still trash over here . 
  doubt their political background was the deciding factor . 
  better than us , sure . 
  i 'm just saying that it 's like 3 steps forward and two steps back . 
  do n't get too high hopes though . 
  it 's never that simple . 
  i do n't get it, 
  that moment when the frankfurt ghetto looks like budapest 's best streets . 
  well i meant the latter , so makes sense . 
  as if the illegal immigrants are behaved or integrated at all . 
  to be fair though poles give very little reason to be discriminated compared to the illegal immigrants ... 
  it 's a must when both sides use almost non-existent standard issue camouflage . 
  early on in the war they used the same uniforms , if they used uniforms at all . 
  now it 's pretty much multicam on ua and digit flora on separatists . 
  you do n't see armbands as often now . 
  so basically when someone builds the eiffel others are mad as fuck ? 
  i know it 's from civ but why is that so significant ? 
  what the hell did i just watch, 
  they are a liability to nato though . 
  strategic importance or not . 
  oh , you fucking made it . 
  funny , you said how they are all fighting for their rights and all , and now `` oh they are just celebrating '' . 
  the sentence in my comment where a question mark was ? 
  you know , that 's what a question is . 
  you still did n't answer my question . 
  but what rights are they even * `` fighting '' * for ? 
  it 's not saudi arabia . 
  there is no gay police in spain . 
  who said gay people ca n't kiss and hold hands ? 
  it 's just making a damn parade out of your sexual orientation is what i find ridiculous . 
  that 's my point . 
  if you 're gay , so be it . 
  i do n't give a fuck . 
  i do give a fuck when they are parading on the streets like `` look at me i 'm gay '' . 
  for me it 's just like when someone is driving in an expensive car . 
  ok , cool . 
  do n't really care . 
  then they start honking and revving up just to make sure everyone is paying attention . 
  it 's just obnoxious . 
  yes , they can use the street , it 's just pointless and fucking obnoxious . 
  why do i * have * to respect it ? 
  you do n't get it , it 's forced down our throats and i do n't fucking like that . 
  the fact that i do n't like it already makes me a homophobe and i 'm hated . 
  why do n't * you * respect that ? 
  basically all you say is : you either love gay people or you can fuck off and ignore it . 
  if you criticise it , you 're a soulless scum . 
  you think you 're so open and so liberal , but actually only when it helps you push your agenda . 
  you ca n't just `` fight '' homophobia . 
  that 's what ** causes the fucking homophobia **, 
  so coming out of closet for gay people means * they parade on the streets shouting i 'm gay * ? 
  instead of just saying `` i 'm gay '' to people who ask ? 
  totally nothing wrong there mate !, 
  all i 'm saying is that this is just pointless dumb shit that just provokes gay hate . 
  it 's just like when liberals shit on conservatives for everything thinking they are so right , but actually they just further alienate themselves from the conservatives , making it worse . 
  gays are n't persecuted , jailed up for being gay , beheaded for being gay . 
  you can live your life fine being gay . 
  if someone hates you for being gay , it 's a social issue , not a political issue . 
  ** and marches like these ** sure as hell wo n't help the gay haters change their minds .
