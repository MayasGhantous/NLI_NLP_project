  enough . 
  stop . 
  no , because apparently than you can never return , as you 're a wanted man . 
  afaik you need to pay money first , around $ 1000 to immigrate , which might not sound a lot , but it is , a lot for us . 
  it is , because you need to * pay money to immigrate * . 
  no money , no immigration . 
  we do . 
  trust me . 
  but wait , even immigration is taxed - no joke . 
  watch it mate ... 
  norwegian one almost sounds like the russian word \u0411\u043b\u044f\u0442 . 
  oh god that police guy at the start ... 
  i feel bad for laughing . 
  wh -- why do you want one ? 
  pronounced as `` madyarorsag '' . 
  actually , now they say they wanted to use the tax to increase the wage of police officers . 
  in my opinion it just seems like a quick attempt to `` bribe '' the riot police . 
  they attacked a reporter and they vandalized fidesz 's hq . 
  other than that , it was a rather peaceful demonstration . 
  most of us were pissed for a long time . 
  this was just a nail in the coffin . 
  some punks attacked a reporter on air , calling him a traitor . 
  i 'm leaving this country if jobbik wins next elections . 
  that two is like our trianon , i guess . 
  we know that feel bro ... 
  so far , none . 
  it 's all quite ironic because he said he will not let this tax pass in 2008 . 
  historically speaking , you 're right . 
  as far as i know , romans were the ancestors of romanians ( dacia and it 's area ) , correct ? 
  would make sense therefore , that the italians ( then romans ) , were `` olasz '' and because of that romanians were `` ol\u00e1h '' . 
  that or i 'm wrong entirely . 
  come on , you can do it . 
  calling them like the neighbours is mainstream , lengyelorsz\u00e1g . 
  rom\u00e1n means romanian . 
  `` ol\u00e1h '' mostly refers to ... 
  gypsies , i suppose . 
  read the greece version of it . 
  almost every european says something like * greek * or * greece * and we just go in like g\u00d6r\u00d6gorsz\u00c1g . 
  how does * nato * track russian troops inside ukraine ? 
  do they mean the rebels or what ? 
  or satellites ? 
  but than how do they separate russians from the rebels ? 
  a more realistic theory is that the tank was sold / smuggled to the rebels . 
  does n't change the point , really , but it being operated by russian crew as well ? 
  not likely . 
  a big point of democracy is the freedom of speech , to begin with ... 
  true , but it is n't like this statement of his is wrong . 
  it 's like erd\u00e9ly for us , hungarians . 
  sometimes i facepalm when people still promote the idea of reconquering it from romania . 
  you forgot this gem : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0giuf-gw2cq, 
  i heard a comparison that fits the russian sitatuation now , which is that the majority does n't really support putin itself , but their country . 
  like , they feel like their country is in danger , and they have to support their leader . 
  if you do n't , you 're viewed as a traitor to russia . 
  kind of like how people in the us viewed the 2003 invasion of iraq . 
  you do n't support it ? 
  you 're against freedom / the country . 
  i feel bad for those though who recognize how fucked up their country is . 
   the joke pretty much applies to every single language ftfy, 
  [ actually , he is right . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/mycountry/hu/index_en.cfm ), 
  be careful what you wish for . 
  what year is this ... 
  than correct me , instead of being a faszfej . 
  this is not facebook . 
  never heard of those . 
  how big are those facilities ? 
  what we * do * have , is food production . 
  fruits ( not exotic ones ) , potatoes , tomatoes , paprika and meat products are usually hungarian . 
  by industry i largely meant things like car , electronics and various other industries like that . 
  we have a samsung and mercedes factory . 
  that 's it , i think , for key industrial factories . 
  it ai n't far from the truth though . 
  not much industry present here , other than a couple of factories in the country . 
  most of the county-wide income comes from various kinds of services , not the industry . 
  which is kind of why the country is stagnating compared to , actually , romania . 
  not many things going for us to improve upon . 
  hah , this guy , thinking we actually have a working industry . 
  with what ? 
  by sending a `` good luck '' ? 
  hardly much use . 
  men , funds or materials would be much more handy . 
  as if brits do not ever make fun of others . 
  come on , do n't be so offended , really . 
  well than it should n't be called * `` racism '' * , which originally meant to be a negative opinion/act based on * race * . 
  yes , the commoners support us . 
  politicians do not . 
  ergo , it 's worthless . 
  because ... 
  they are ? 
  that 's like saying `` afro-americans are a race ? 
  why ? 
  in the end i think it was just a sarcastic joke . 
  you 're taking it too far . 
  freedom of speech should be held up , obviously . 
  but i understand the banning of meaningless racist posts . 
  that is n't racism either . 
  syrians are citizens , arabs are a race . 
  if you said `` all arabs are terrorists '' , that would 've been racism - because you judged them by their race alone . 
  more like `` good luck europe '' . 
  everyone just wants us to do the dirty work .
