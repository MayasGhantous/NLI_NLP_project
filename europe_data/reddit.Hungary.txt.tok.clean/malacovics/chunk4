  and when the masses arrive to western countries , they suddenly react . 
  like , ffs , germany , denmark and sweden could 've prepared while we go fucked over . 
  that still does n't make it racism . 
  the correct term you 're looking for is stereotypes . 
  not racism . 
  britons are a race ? 
  this is how ww1 was setting up ... 
  this is anti-terrorism done wrong . 
  * removes sweden from 'em igration plans ' list *, 
  the fuck ? 
  romania , stop being progressive . 
  you 're doing it wrong , you 're supposed to steal the eu funds . 
  ^ ^ ` least ^ ^ i ^ ^ was ^ ^ told ^ ^ to, 
  oh we do give a fuck . 
  the main topic everywhere all the time is the migrant situation . 
  we just have no choice but to do what we have to do . 
  of course inviting them is n't a good idea , i agree , but you really do n't have much to worry about . 
  remember the heaven something cult ? 5, 
  both try to force their twisted lifes on you , so not really , they are n't any different for me . 
  i think we can conclude that the vast majority is n't just `` fleeing war '' . 
  if they were , they would 've stopped at turkey . 
  while millions * did * , those who come here come only for work . 
  and a few dozen thousand would be managable for europe . 
  but at this rate , it 's completely unsustainable . 
  this was probably one of the best thing he 's done in years . 
  yes . 
  serbia does n't get to choose in that case . 
  just as germany pushed the refugees back to us . 
  bad bad people , please , go home !, 
  this refugee meme is the new dank meme after ukraine/putin ? 
  `` arresting '' does n't mean `` putting them in prison '' . 
  they 'll most likely be released or sent back to their previous country . 
  lol the policemen are literally saying '' ... the fuck is he doing ? '', 
  except iraq was not in the middle of a civil war for half a decade . 
  it does n't seem very fitting though to begin with . 
  2003 iraq is n't similar to 2015 syria . 
   in bavaria they are already driving buses to hungary and bulgaria for people to work so its not like we do n't need the work force . 
  except here nobody supports them and people are demanding the military to use live rounds on the border . 
  you underestimate our racism . 
  i heard europe ( or anything else other than america ) is a cultural shock for them , mostly because of how * old * things are for them . 
  for me , 1800s are what i consider `` really old '' . 
  well , the `` too far for a drive '' differs for a hungarian and an american . 
  for me , even 100km is a long drive . 
  for an american , that could very well be going shopping . 
  for me , sometimes it 's hard to grasp the size of the us . 
  but really , i wish everyone got to visit the place sometime , before thinking genocide is a good option . 
  you mean monte cassino ? 
  true , around 80 thousand kia , but keep in mind , that battle was 4 months long though , not a day . 
  and a german makes the comment . 
  this could n't been better . 
   2000 at a time . 
  jesus fucking christ ... more people died in just two gassing than all us soldiers died in the war in afghanistan in the past decade . 
  `` one death is a tragedy ; one million is a statistic . '', 
  no , the convoy was less than that . 
  lot less . 
  altogether there were like 20 vehicles . 
  i 'd say like 10 lavs , 5 abrams tanks , 3 humwees , 2 howitzers and some supplies and support vehicles . 
  also , there were no bradley vehicles on the train , while the link says that train has 4 or 8 bradleys . 
  took it on saturday , so 4 days ago . 
  fits the direction it was heading , and the timing . 
  you sure ? 
  same tanks , same howitzers , same support vehicle ( the one without a turret on the abrams hull ) , same lavs . 
  this very much looks like the same convoy . 
  wait , i 've seen these in hungary . 
  i was on the train station in szolnok ( middle of hungary ) , when this convoy passed by . 
  cool to see them again . 
  at this point i think they just no longer give a fuck . 
  or foolish . 
  doubt it 's uncommon . 
  i think it 's just simply such a stigma that most men just simply never reveal it . 
  heard about a guy here on reddit who was raped in his sleep ( he was married to someone else ) , and his friends laughed at him . 
  other than reddit he never shared this with anyone else . 
  i guess so if you 're hungarian . 
  racism and anti-semitism skyrocketed lately . 
  which is a shame , really . 
  does n't hurt you when you do n't know about it , but once you do , it just irks me so bad .

  because i thought serbia is finally aligning with the eu , as most of its neighbours do . 
  belarus and russia , okay , but serbia ? 
  the fuck ? 
  i thought he was talking about hungary for a second ... 
  so fitting . 
   they dont have education and its our fault . 
  the fuck ? 
  if i 'm rich as fuck , but too dumb to make use of it , is it your fault ? 
  no it ai n't . 
  we 've been trying to teach and educate and help the afghans for over a decade , and it turned out to be completely fucking pointless . 
  they do n't want it , and they do n't care about it . 
  what do you mean `` our creation '' ? 
  the iraqi invasion ? 
  or afghanistan ? 
  radical muslims were there before us . 
  the soviets learned it the wrong way too . 
   why do they hate us in the first place . 
  hmm , i wonder why radical muslims hate christian europeans . 
  these monkeys do not rest until everyone on earth is a muslim and lives by stone age rules and standards . 
  i just do n't like reading biased posts , regardless of which side . 
  is that a problem ?
