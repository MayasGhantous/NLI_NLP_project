  than put / s at the end of your comment please , or else you just look dumb as hell . 
  prove it . 
  actually , you do n't need to , because others already did prove my point . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ukrainianconflict/comments/3gl40v/video_russian_offensive_in_luhansk_oblast_goes/ctzin2i9 ) why the fuck are you downvoting him when he is right ? 
  videos rarely transfer the actual combat from a soldier 's perspective . 
  your eyes easily detect a target at 300m , while for the camera , it 's like a single pixel . 
  also keep in mind , in real life , 95 % of shots fired are for suppression - shooting in the general direction of the enemy , to make sure they do n't do the same and keep their heads down . 
  as if al jazeera was n't anti-russian . 
  hey , hey you , you want to tell me that a coin has two sides ?!, 
  but i thought we 're always right no matter what !, 
  and that justifies shitposts like these ? 
  if we want to delve into this russia topic again , at least make it a proper discussion thread . 
  one man 's propaganda troll , other man 's patriot . 
  can we refrain from posting one sided posts ? 
  what the fuck romania ... stop being progressive . 
  you know your country is stagnating at best when the romanian assholes are starting to best your economy and infrastructure . 
  typical of us . 
  ** romania is of gypsy !, 
  ** ^ ^ is ^ ^ true, 
  i 'm not sure if we watched the same video , or we live on the same planet for that matter . 
  because they can and they know we wo n't do shit anyways . 
  data is not as scary as seeing it with your two eyes . 
  just like when they say 21 people died in a firefight last week . 
  well , shit happens . 
  but when you see that 21 people getting gunned down , it feels a lot more rage inducing . 
  well if an immigrant got a job in britain instead of a british citizen , than that means nobody wanted that job . 
  said worker also pays taxes . 
  this is the healthy kind of immigration . 
   i am just wondering as to how a country like hungary who is n't really that wealthy is able to take care of all these refugees ? 
  oh , so do we . 
  we have no plans what so ever for countering the immigrants . 
  exactly . 
  those who applied with a proper visa and are useful members of the society should have all rights to stay here . 
  people who cross illegally should be deported without notice immediately . 
  same here in hungary . 
  i think we can agree that it 's all the same in all of europe , at least eastern europe . 
  i have some roma friends who are kinder and more educated than most hungarians , so it 's not impossible . 
  sadly the majority is like the homeless gypsy type who ca n't , and * do n't want to * integrate to the society . 
  i 'm not sure if you 're seriously retarded or just forgot the / s mark at the end . 
  but the guy implied nato did all the work , which is not true , at all . 
  for the first time , retarded copyright workarounds favor us . 
  nato did n't do shit other than bombing . 
  it was the croats on the ground who captured every city one by one . 
  might want to give credible source . 
  that page is biased * as fuck * . 
  than he is primarily an isis fighter , as he is * fighting * western citizens . 
  i ca n't wait until some hungarian political site finds this chart . 
  `` hungarians work 500 hours more than germans , yet they get twice as much money !, 
  revise trianon ! '', 
  come on , dude made a shitty joke , stop downvoting him to oblivion . 
  one alive western citizen is worth a hundred dead isis fighters in my opinion . 
  the biggest problem is that it 's been like this forever , and people were used to it . 
  hell , sunday in hungarian means `` vas\u00e1rnap '' which literally means `` market day '' . 
  ironic since all markets are closed now on sunday . 
  well fidesz are a bunch of greedy fucks , but when you bring in racism , patriotism and blind hate ? 
  yeah , shit can go wrong really quick ... 
  doubt it , jobbik is just another party riding the hate train . 
  they 'll do exactly what orban does . 
  who did exactly what gyurcsany did . 
  they just change the issues , promise the heavens before voting seasons and then get back to stealing money . 
  4 years later , this , all over again . 
  this is my problem . 
  there is not a single sensible and powerful party . 
  and if there happened to be one , it would be so unpopular that it would never get into power , because not a single millionaire investor/politician wants a party who serves the citizens , and not the state/their corporation . 
  that 's just democracy at work . 
  it sucks , but there ai n't any better . 
  the blind patriotism and racism is getting out of hand i 'd say . 
  thank god most of them are just keyboard warriors . 
  it would be a rebellion otherwise . 
  i think they were rather high when they designed that poster . 
  i walk past one of those every day when i go out . 
  i always crack a smile and shake my head . 
  i 'm now at the age where i can vote , and i have no fucking idea who i 'll vote for in a few years . 
  everyone seems to be a bunch of morons trying to get to power with no regards to the citizens themselves . 
  for a few months now everything * has to be * closed on sundays . 
  what this resulted in however is that since all shops are closed on sunday , everyone empties out the shops on saturday , and since people could n't buy anything on sunday , the shops are emptied again on monday . 
  so in 7 days of the week , on 3 days you ca n't really rely on grocery shops . 
  which is quite annoying . 
  not sure what it 's like in big cities like budapest , but in a rather small city ( 70k population szolnok ) , it 's really annoying . 
  i imagine it 's even worse in smaller villages . 
  i think the situation in england and hungary different enough to not be uncomparable . 
  all we can agree on is that immigration could be a problem if handled badly . 
  what the problem is and what the potentional solution is could be very different for both countries . 
  if so , than why do they make their titles so sensational all the time ? 
  by the way , there is no conspiracy here . 
  bbc is just another company , that happens to earn its income from journalism . 
  the more views , the more attention and money they get - also known as the only thing they pay attention to . 
  shitty journalism ? 
  yeah , it is . 
  more profits this way ? 
  yeah , also . 
  logical . 
   the only people who would be fooled by that are idiots who do n't read the article so basically the majority of the viewers ? 
  titles like these are the definition of sensationalism . 
  ** russia cuts of gas from ukraine !, 
  ** ^ ^ ^ ^ because ^ ^ ^ ^ they ^ ^ ^ ^ did n't ^ ^ ^ ^ pay ^ ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ ^ them . 
  i feel sorry for you right now . 
  this place is the worst place in europe for a foreigner . 
  the goal was to make the tobacco profits more beneficial to the government ( and the ruling party ) , it was n't an `` anti-smoking campaign '' . 
  they do n't .
