  yuo of lie !, 
  uh , they are exactly that . 
  fair enough . 
  except you got 8 times more upvotes than the comment at hand . 
  so that 's clearly not true . 
  and if you realize it 's a stupid argument , why did you post the comment ? 
  it 's funny when people laughed at the `` putinbots '' who upvote/downvote everything , when we do the exact same thing to foreign critique . 
  so when russians pull the `` but you guys did xy too '' you reason with `` but that does n't justify yours '' . 
  however , when an american says it , everyone agrees . 
  what ? 
  so than back to hating russia !, 
  china , pakistan , iran , north korea ... quite honestly , i would consider china to be a bigger threat than russia . 
  but you do n't fuck with the country that has thousands of your factories , right ? 
  give me a poor hug , we poors stick together . 
  55 million people is nothing for you ? 
  what this chart shows is that it 's easier to spark a poor country 's economy than upgrade an economy that 's already strong . 
  i bet it would be similar if the survey was done in the us . 
  that 's because we do . 
  thank you / u/reesesjesus . 
  because / r/europe does n't like anything even remotely positive that is russia related . 
  true or false , irrelevant . 
  yeah , fuck him for being open minded . 
  so better soldiers are sent to harder fronts ? 
  why , i wonder . 
  welp , time to become russian for an hour and half . 
  i love their parades . 
  i 'm not jelous , i just pointed out that people nowadays post anything negative topic related to russia , since they know it will gain a lot of attention anyways . 
  it 's like the 1980 's all over again . 
  how was this a big secret ? 
  because russian posts are easy karma grabs . 
  stock up while you can . 
  if by respect you mean proxy war ... 
   state workers do n't speak romanian with you or they just completely ignore you if you do n't talk hungarian i heard the exact same thing , except from the other side . 
  all in all , i do n't think sz\u00e9kelys and romanians will ever get along in the same country . 
   why does everybody think hungarian were/are discriminate ? 
  not really nowadays , which is what i experienced there . 
  my godparents are sz\u00e9kelys who moved to hungary two decades ago or so . 
  they told stories like how the shopkeeper did n't let him speak hungarian , even though he completely understood it ( told him to speak `` the proper language '' ) . 
  it got a lot better as of today , but it used to be horrible . 
   i think romanians in harghita and covasna are more discriminated than any szeklers . 
  that 's because in those regions the sz\u00e9kelys are the majority , and romanians are considered the minority . 
  when you 're in a hungarian town , with 95 % of the population being hungarian , of course they wo n't elect a romanian mayor . 
  just as romania will never have a hungarian president . 
  sz\u00e9kelys do n't trust romanians , and they consider them invaders in transylvania . 
  why * would * they elect a romanian president ? 
  it 's hard to tell on the internet . 
  and nowadays , germans tend to act like they are poor anyways ( they brag about their `` weak '' military , `` weak '' politics , `` weak '' industry etc. ), 
  yes !, 
  obviously , we understand each other perfectly , but there are quite a few words i did n't understand . 
  mostly words that we no longer use for centuries . 
  and their accent is lovely . 
   i mean , we are one of the worlds poorest countries , the fuck ? 
  i got home about a week ago from a week long trip in erd\u00e9ly ( duh , transylvania ) . 
  beautiful place . 
  no wonder most hungarians are butthurt about it being taken from us . 
  it 's nice to see though that there are many 95 % hungarian towns , with hungarian shops and schools in it . 
  a few decades ago even speaking hungarian was discriminated . 
  reddit does n't like discussing things . 
  downvoting requires less effort . 
  hey , the jas-39 ai n't even bad . 
  an f-16 fleet would 've served us better , but it 's still a neat jet . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ transylvania ^ ^ ^ ^ iz ^ ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ ^ romania, 
  your military is just as piss poor as ours . 
  if not actually better . 
  it 's been well known for many months . 
  now it 's up to us to finally dump the 40 + year old garbage we use , and modernize our military . 
  thank you / u/finnishperson . 
  your next therapy is scheduled for tuesday next week . 
   it was quite obvious what happened to those pows after the parade . 
  nothing but speculations . 
  i also heard they were later released . 
  there is even a video where ukrainian soldiers died from their wounds in a ukrainian field hospital , and even * them * were tied up . 
  definitely executed !, 
  no way they were transported !, 
  holy shit , the downvotes . 
  he speaks the truth , bodies are always tied up , the hands and legs flop all around making their handling a lot more difficult . 
  but of course , everyone in / r/europe is a chairborne veteran , and knows everything about warfare , and they are never wrong . 
  even in the `` frozen bodies '' link all you have are close up shots , nothing around to see for a greater picture . 
  they are n't in the ruins either , in fact , i 'm sure they were killed inside the ruins , and were brought out . 
  you do n't want a body rotting by your cover , that 's for sure . 
  the video even says that they might have been simply tied up for easier transportation . 
  but i guess logical thinking is not welcome here when russia is involved . 
  as for motorola - he 's a fucking mental idiot . 
  no wonder he shot 15 prisoners . 
  in fact , i already guessed it was him , when i heard those rumors . 
  holy shit ukraine is piss poor . 
  i met a guy once who seriously thought europe/eu was a country . 
  how the hell did they even keep him captive for 3 years ? 
  i thought al-queda takes no prisoners . 
  `` where are you from ? '', 
  `` hungary . '', 
  `` i asked where are you from , not how much you ate today . '', 
  yeah , as i said , if you put all the political bullshit aside , it 's a wonderful country . 
  so for a visitor , it 's pretty neat . 
  but living here is a different story . 
  but i guess this applies to all countries ever . 
  tl ; dr : our country is far from proper democracy and is a political shithole and radicalism is on the rise . 
  other than that , we 're pretty good . 
  not finnish at all , but i guess the anti-nato majority in finland are just afraid of the consequences russia might impose . 
  but that should not be an excuse .
