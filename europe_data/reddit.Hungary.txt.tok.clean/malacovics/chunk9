  again , when did i say the world is ok ? 
  it 's not . 
  it 's still the safest and most peaceful it has ever been . 
  that 's a fact . 
  do n't agree ? 
  look up the number of deaths involved in wars in the past five centuries . 
  thousands are murdered in africa , hundreds if not thousands are executed and beheaded in syria and iraq day after day - yet people are all losing their minds over a few plane strong air space incursion . 
  but worry not , keep clicking the downvote button and keep copypasting anti-separatist/anti-russian quotes we 've heard a billion times in / r/europe - like i even like russia or their politics in the first place . 
  while superpower might not be the most fitting term , they still are a great power . 
  and yes , i consider france and india equally powerful . 
  india has a strong economy , strong military and nukes ( and also billions of people ) . 
  france also has a strong economy and has a modern , strong military too . 
  i think it 's simply because they were designed for a bit more different roles . 
  true . 
  in the end , they pose a danger . 
  but not as a big one as op claimed . 
  and * any and all * unidentified aircrafts are immediately intercepted - even if proven to be an unarmed airliner . 
  even if not a superpower , it 's still a lot more relevant and powerful than even some british claim . 
   tu-95 is slow yeah . 
  in an hour it travels like 800 kilometers . 
  surely a snail . 
  ^ ^ ^ / s  we wo n't help them and they do n't want our help . 
  they were intercepted by raf ( ** as they always were ** ) , which proves otherwise . 
   sorry , i only called you dumb because you continue to white wash the actions of russia now tell me one line where i said that their actions are justified . 
  i just said it 's greatly exaggerated , and it is . 
  and now you pull this ukrainian stuff + anti-separatist lines which are ** completely ** unrelated and off topic . 
  this is the first of your posts that i downvote , because now this truly brings up bullshit points , not discussion worthy . 
  no wonder you wo n't reply , since you * ca n't * . 
  it really is . 
  there is something about the shape of russian jets that i really dig . 
  mig-29 is a classic too . 
  no need to tell me how basic atc works , thank you . 
  and fyi many military aircrafts fly without transponders on in the us too . 
  even some commercial airlines have their transponder turned off ( by accident or malfunction ) . 
  and they still are n't dropping off the skies . 
  many understimate how safe commercial aviation is . 
   you clearly are n't the sharpest tool in the shed . 
  there are n't any over the uk specifically because we intercept them with our fighters . 
  so than why do you complain about `` bombers above your head '' when the airforce takes care of it anyways ? 
   why should we ? 
  because you ca n't tell who they are approaching . 
  give them 10 minutes above ireland and they are in wales . 
  this is not just about `` helping ireland '' , but protecting their very own air space from a * possible * threat . 
  and do n't call me dumb when you ca n't mentally proccess the fact that this is but a test , and it 's not a challenge for either uk or ireland to overcome . 
  not unless russia flat out freaking bombs ireland . 
  * then * , i can see your worries . 
  edit : oh , and the dislike button is not a `` i do n't agree '' button . 
  clicking it is n't an effective reasoning tool . 
  superpower does n't really mean that you can march up twenty million troops to battle . 
  if your country has the firepower to annihilate entire countries ( which the uk can ) , and your country has massive political influence on others , it is a superpower . 
  hungary is n't a superpower , because we ca n't do either of them . 
   ireland has no typhoons . 
  but the uk does . 
  and ireland is in the uk 's interest too . 
  if your neighbour 's house was on fire , would you help them out , or would you risk your own house getting burned down by it ? 
  if a russian bomber ( or any non-nato unidentified/military aicraft ) happened approach great britain , they 'd intercept it . 
   i 'm sorry but i for one do not want a jingoistic countries nuclear capable bombers flying over my land and lo-behold , there are none !, 
  that 's the point !, 
  why the hell else would they intercept the bombers ? 
  if the bombers would pose any threat , they 'd get shot the fuck down . 
  raf pilots are n't taxi drivers , you know ? 
   they might just accidentally crash into them though , due to the transponders being turned off ... do you even know how small the chances are for that to happen ? 
  and by the time the russian jet is even approaching , typhoons are already on the way to intercept and escort them anyways . 
  because , you know , that 's the point of * interception * . 
   and yes , i am talking about actual air violations not just approaches . 
  and it still is n't more than just another dick measuring contest . 
  if they really wanted to pose a threat , they 'd come with a hundred bombers escorted by fighters . 
  is it unacceptable ? 
  no , no it is n't . 
  but should we really hype this up as much as the media did ? 
  of course not . 
  this is just a test . 
  not a hidden russian invasion as some exaggerate . 
  nukes , strong navy and strong army with the airforce soon getting massive changes . 
  yeah , does n't sound like a third world country to me . 
  no clue . 
  look up some info on them if you 're curious , i 'm sure you 'll find some interesting read . 
  i heard that they often train with foreign special forces and they are very well equipped . 
  they will never shoot at irish military aircrafts . 
  they did with ukraine , but ukraine is n't as close to the west as ireland , and with the uk , a ~ ~ superpower ~ ~ `` great power '' nearby ... you can call the russians whatever you want , but they are n't * retarded * . 
  and this `` oh mah lawd jehsus russians are comin ' '' on the news every freaking week . 
  every single one . 
  and not one was eventful . 
  the russian bombers just approach , they are intercepted by the raf , they wave their wings and go on their business . 
  that 's it . 
  and it 's been going on for ** decades ** . 
  and yet people are * still * losing their minds when it happens . 
  nato does it quite often too . 
  [ and the russians do the same , ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn8ooefnupm ) they intercept them with su-27s , wave their wings and go home . 
  that 's it . 
  it 's like a weekly minor dick measuring contest , nothing more . 
  edit : inb4 getting disliked for not being hyped all over again for the same shit we 've seen a thousand times . 
  look up the irish rangers . 
  i 'd say they are about as professional as the navy seals . 
  they never prioritised their military . 
  they have a very famous and professional special forces branch though . 
  the hungarian one is sooo hungarian . 
   human rights were not invented to be good for the economy . 
  and we want to ruin our culture , society and economy just because ... rights ? 
  rights are meant to work for us , and now they work against us .
