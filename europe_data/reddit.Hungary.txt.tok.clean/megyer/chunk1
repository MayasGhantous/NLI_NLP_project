it 's reddit 's new favourite thing . 
  crushing stuff with a hydraulic press . 
  no , it was n't . 
  we got a lot of shit for it . 
  yeah , austria does it and now it 's suddenly ok . 
  we were n't there when i wrote that comment . 
  and we are n't even there ... 
  sorry but this caught my attention . 
  brazil is by no means a small country . 
  it 's the 5th largest country in the world ( both by area and by population ) . 
  complaining about downvotes and calling me childish . 
  how does that make it better ? 
  they confirmed that one of them came as a refugee . 
  is it far fetched to assume there are others ? 
  i do realize you 're trying to be smart by keep saying '' * all of them * '' but i never actually said that . 
  [ the video confirms that all of the jihadists who took part in the paris attacks fought for the islamic state in iraq and syria beforehand . 
  ] ( http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/01/before-paris-attack-islamic-state-terrorists-committed-grisly-executions.php ), 
  the paris attackers came back to europe as refugees so it is , at the very least , a reasonable assumption . 
  that 's the past . 
  now they are so bad , they have to bring in one of their former colonies to even stand a chance . 
  there are current pipelines going through the country that would lose a lot of business if nord stream were to be built . 
  there were also two planned pipelines : the south stream and nabucco , both have been abandoned , that were supposed to go through hungary . 
  i think some people still hope that one of them will be built someday . 
  the us has a federal system so , in some cases , the state law can be different than the federal law . 
  that 's not the same as a supreme court overruling a decision . 
  and that is exactly why it 's a stupid idea to pick one extreme case that was all over the news . 
  out of hundreds of thousands of people you pick one case to which nobody would dare to say no . 
  hey !, 
  let 's use one extreme case to prove a point . 
  nobody calls them bohemian because nobody uses the word bohemia . 
  just because you were born in a country with high immigration does n't mean you know more about it . 
  i know , given that you were complaining about the downvotes an hour ago . 
  check their flair . 
  this comment is so condescending that i 've downvoted all your comments in this thread . 
  too bad you only have 3 . 
  [ after a visa-free period of seven years starting in the 1990s , canada reintroduced a visa regime for hungarian nationals in 2001 due to the large number of immigrants ( mostly roma ) arriving from hungary . 
  the visa requirement was lifted for hungary , the czech republic , and slovakia in 2008 , which triggered another immigration wave . 
  kenney said at his latest talks in budapest that tens of thousands of hungarian roma now lived in canada . 
  ] ( http://www.politics.hu/20121015/canada-vows-to-continue-deporting-hungarian-asylum-seekers/ ), 
  which is a big difference . 
  this is a democratically elected government , however shitty it might be . 
  same with me and my brother . 
  we were both born lefties but our mother forced us to do everything with our right . 
  that 's different . 
  lots of municipalities give subsidies to locals to support businesses . 
  how is that the same thing ? 
  they have a subscription for which they pay . 
  just tried to use it in another coutnry . 
  i would really love to tell you the whole story . 
  but the thing is , this hours worth of history class and i ca n't just summarize it in a reddit comment . 
  but if you did n't just link to some awful picture from wikipedia then it would take you about a minute to find out the details . 
  you said ussr . 
  but the german invasion happened 2 weeks beforehand . 
  when the ussr attacked poland was already lost . 
  hence my correction . 
  and i suggest you get off the high horse . 
   the fact that most british people are very open and globalist how did you measure that ? 
  i did n't find them that open at all . 
  they 're friendly but far from openly accepting everybody . 
  and britain as globalist ? 
  the entire european history of the uk is about isolation . 
  a global empire is not the same as being globalist . 
  equally bad or equally good ? 
  what makes you think that all people will be welcomed ? 
  apart from your rambling in your other comment about how open you are . 
  i mean , did you really think i was sending him personally after a violent group ? 
  nice going , mate !, 
  i was n't talking about you specifically but the general french protectionism . 
  somebody mentioned [ this group ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comit%c3%a9_r%c3%a9gional_d'action_viticole ) in yesterday 's thread . 
  maybe you should start with them ? 
  your protectionism and nationalism is adorable but there must be a limit . 
   poland from the ussr in 1939 from germany . 
  the german invasion started 2 weeks earlier . 
  it does , thanks !, 
  we ca n't read the reasearch . 
  the page is just a text something about copyright in dutch . 
  which is even more important , is n't it ? 
   a vote of confidence so is not winning in a general election . 
   financial relations are pretty damn well proven so was the sexual relation but that did n't stop clinton from denying it . 
  there 's nothing in this article about turkey 's membership . 
  it 's about the migrant crisis and that satirical video about erdogan . 
  yeah , i mean technically the [ double irish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/double_irish_arrangement ) was n't illegal either . 
  that 's the point . 
  how are these not high profile : [ j\u00e9r\u00f4me cahuzac ] ( https://projects.icij.org/panama-papers/power-players/#4 ) [ baroness pamela sharples ] ( https://projects.icij.org/panama-papers/power-players/#28 ) [ michael ashcroft ] ( https://projects.icij.org/panama-papers/power-players/#24 ) [ michael mates ] ( https://projects.icij.org/panama-papers/power-players/#5 ) [ konrad mizzi ] ( https://projects.icij.org/panama-papers/power-players/#52 ) etc. . . , they 're all ministers and parliament members . 
   the fund `` will not be subject to united kingdom corporation tax or income tax on its profits . '', 
  blairmore used a large amount of bearer shares -- unregistered shares that belong to anyone who physically holds the share certificates -- until 2006 . 
  what is this if not tax avoidance ? 
  they do n't care what the west thinks about putin . 
  and they prefer donbass to be a mess . 
  nothing you say is relevant to russia . 
  they wanted a buffer state between them and the nato ( since they lost ukraine ) and now they have one . 
  the same way they are not interested in sorting out the problems in transnistria or south ossetia . 
  they have already withdrawn the bulk of their forces from syria . 
  what makes you say that they 're not successful in ukraine ? 
  they 're utterly succesful in both ukraine and syria and they are more than capable to enter into another conflict . 
  and it 's in their best interest to prolong this conflict and keep the region unstable so turkey ca n't just sit back . 
  you should n't and you , in fact , you did n't . 
  throwing around clever one-liners just make you look like a fool . 
  especially whit articles like this . 
  ** it 's about isis .
