   the situation of christians in iraq has become progressively worse how ? 
  when ? 
  can you provide any proofs ? 
  you 're just talking out of your ass all over this thread . 
   hence most iraqi christians no longer living in iraq . 
  they , along with syrian christians , started to flee the country when isis gained a lot of territory and support . 
   i ca n't believe anyone would be so thick-skinned as to argue it 's safe to be christian in iraq again , provide some proofs and i 'll believe you . 
  you have n't provided anything in this thread that supports any of your claims . 
  there is a genocide committed by isis . 
  again , most of iraq is not ruled by isis . 
  ** that article is from 2007 . 
  it 's 9 years old . 
  ** and the [ follow-up ] ( http://www.aina.org/news/20070417105313.htm ) is just some vague claims by a few `` residents '' that insurgents just appaered out of nowhere in the middle of the capital city . 
  do they say they 're going back to live under isis rule ? 
  because most of iraq is not ruled by isis ( or islamists for that matter . ), 
  however disgusting it might be , it 's part of our history . 
  in hungary , we collected them and put them in a park so everybody can see them . 
  name one official , governmental human rights group or organisation that is more than a joke . 
  is this really newsworthy ? 
  it 's a drop in the ocean . 
  the eu funding in hungary is around 6 billion eur . 
  suspending funds also happens regularly . 
  [ eu suspends funding for bulgaria ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7520736.stm )  about 500m euros ( # 400m ; $ 800m ) of aid to bulgaria is being frozen by the commission . 
  [ eu suspends funds for romania citing fraud concerns ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/romania-still-faces-problems-with-eu-funds )  the european union has suspended some 1 billion euro in funding for romanian projects , concerned about financial irregularities in a number of planned projects . 
  [ the eu commission has suspended more than # 45m earmarked for scotland under the european social fund after what it called `` irregularities '' in spending . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-34015720 ), 
   always gets controlled , like for any traveller no , it does n't . 
  someone bored out of their mind looks at your passport then at you and then gives it back , says something like ` have a nice day ! ', 
  and that 's it . 
  i have travelled to and from the uk countless times and i can recall two times when they checked my details on a computer . 
  they 're pretty much against radicalism . 
  [ bosnia 's muslim leaders ban radical islamist 's congregations ] ( http://bigstory.ap.org/article/077472fc0c734c649c5db40c804f772f/bosnias-muslim-leaders-ban-radical-islamists-congregations ), 
  yes , but as a tourist you will probably be around places that are likely to get hit . 
  airports , train stations , attractions , etc. . . 
  after the paris attacks , i got into an argument with a few french redditors because i insisted that was just the beginning . 
  they literally told me `` this was just one attack , chill out '' . 
  the japanese and we use it tthat way too . 
   this sub is n't capable of this sort of distinction this is literally the exact same generalisation . 
  and he 's saying that european governments have no influence over fifa . 
  the only truly logical solution . 
  also , surname first and then given name . 
  it has nothing to do with my pride . 
  it 's a very clear cut situation . 
  slovakia was n't ruled as a seperate country but as part of hungary . 
  they were n't the king of slovakia . 
  as part of the habsburg empire , the kingdom of hungary was still a seperate entity . 
  it was never incorporated into austria proper . 
  that 's why they used the title , king of hungary . 
   just click harder , you can rewrite history !!!, 
  it 's pretty much you who is trying to rewrite history . 
  the ottomans did n't rule all of it , the kingdom still existed . 
  and the habsburgs used the title ( along with many others ) ` apostolic king of hungary ' . 
  i 'm going to be so happy when you finally leave and realise that your country has no meaningful trade agreements whatsoever . 
   the angry brigade  targets included banks , embassies , the miss world event in 1970 ( or rather a bbc outside broadcast vehicle earmarked for use in the bbc 's coverage ) and the homes of conservative mps . 
  in total , police attributed 25 bombings to the angry brigade . 
  the bombings mostly caused property damage ; ** one person was slightly injured ** . 
  this sounds like a [ stereotypical canadian ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/gjskk ) terror organisation . 
  can we really talk about inflation when the coins were minted from precious metals and thus giving them real value ? 
  it does n't . 
  they said `` these are not isolated attacks committed by a few extremists . '', 
  you asked `` what are they then ? '' . 
  and then i explained it . 
  they are well planned , prepared and executed attacks by an international terrorist organisation . 
  i know this is a comedy show but it 's actually true . 
  this was the british foreign policy for hundreds of years . 
  they also do n't plan these attacks and have absolutely no say in anything . 
  they 're irrelevant . 
  there is lot of logic in what they do . 
  in case you have n't noticed , they regularly commit terrorist attacks in western europe . 
  these are smart people and not some religious dumbs that you would like to believe . 
  you know , if you 're trying to save face by comparing belgium and france to north africa then there 's an even bigger problem . 
  western european countries are supposed to be secular , first world countries that are economically and , more importantly , socially more developed so the comparison is at the very least shaky . 
  a comment on reddit is not really a proof , is it ? 
  there is n't even a single source in there , just speculation . 
   pkk = tak this is just outright wrong . 
  they * may be linked , may be not * . 
  [ some believe the tak is a wing of the pkk ; to others , it is a separate organization . 
  ] ( http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/02/turkey-outlawed-tak-will-not-deviate-line-of-ocalan.html ) tak comes from pkk for sure because pkk is willing to negotiate with turkey but these people refuse to do so . 
  exactly , the small companies do n't have the resources , so the second best thing is to cash out . 
  secret facebook group ? 
  come on people , it 's ridiculous . 
  so that 's an excuse ? 
  why do i remember armchair freedom figthers shouting war crimes when the russians hit a hospital in syria ? 
  and the 168 is for one month . 
  except you 're way overdoing it . 
  if you cut your military spending by half , you 'd still have the biggest army and have the biggest military budget . 
  of course , then you would n't be able to meddle on every continent . 
  i do n't understand why you 're trying to excuse the saudis . 
  [ during february , a total of at least 168 civilians were killed and 193 injured , around two-thirds of them by coalition airstrikes . 
  ] ( http://www.ohchr.org/en/newsevents/pages/displaynews.aspx?newsid=17146&amp;langid=e ) they routinely do double-tap bombings . 
  the saudis are bombing hospitals . 
  not with barrel bombs , but with modern , precise weapons . 
  the current sanctions hurt other countries . 
  i guess that does n't concern you , does it ? 
  so , you only sanction areas where it does n't hurt you . 
   showing that isis still controls the vast majority of syria it does n't . 
  assad still controls about 70 % of the population . 
  what you see on that map is mostly empty desert . 
  none of your points refutes the point this map is trying to show though . 
  there 's a good balance between the two .
