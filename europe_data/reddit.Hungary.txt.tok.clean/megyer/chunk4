  i can assure you that i 'm familiar with both words ( survey and poll ) and that 's 1500 women per countries . 
  this is as reliable as the nielsen ratings in the tv industry . 
  this is just a survey . 
  it has no real base . 
  it 's not a statistic . 
  saying that they extrapolated is just a fancy word for multiplying it . 
  it 's not a real number . 
  and the other sources are all from different years . 
   well actually when migrants came to hungary he simply sent buses to take them to austria . 
  hungary never stopped a single migrant , we just let them go undisturbed to germany . 
  this is , of course , a blatant lie . 
  the buses were sent after merkel 's infamous speech when the migrants started their journey from budapest on * foot * . 
  and then next when the croatian pm announced that they 'd take everybody and after one day they collapsed and started to dump them on the hungarian border . 
  i 'm sorry but this is n't a trustworthy source . 
  it 's a feminist site and out of the 3 sources they cite : the first one is just a survey ( in which hungary performs better than the eu avarage ) , the second one is the 2011 census ( what ? 
  ) , and another one is just the statistics from the public prosecutor ( without a link ) . 
   article writers just do n't know what a tank that 's pretty common . 
  i 've noticed that practically every western newspaper will report any kind of armored vehicle as a tank . 
  the ones on the picture seem to be some kind of apcs . 
  gaddafi actually predicted everything that is happening now . 
  they 're not in there because trading with saudi arabia is mostly private business . 
  but the eu is not here to put private interests over geopolitical ones . 
  compared to the size of the eu 's economy it 's just a drop in the ocean . 
  a good thing in the eu is that , every statistics is public and can be searched easily . 
  http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2006/september/tradoc_111845.pdf that 's how big they 're . 
  it 's practically non-existant . 
  we keep telling it to you . 
  but you 're too drunk to listen . 
  the uk does n't want to be part of the eu and these things are the main reason why i 'm fine with it . 
  mindless , ** private ** , weapon contracts are not part of the eu budget . 
  what jobs and money ? 
  what trading partner ? 
  you 're talking out of your ass . 
  the saudis are in deep trouble and will do anything to find a country that is willing to cooperate with them . 
  just fyi , we have no significant economic relations with them . 
  we wo n't have weaker economy for pissing off the saudis . 
  the us only keeps them happy because they have geopolitical interests in the region . 
  the eu now has iran as a sort of ally there . 
  being poor does n't really matter . 
  iraqi kurdistan is a very poor region ( well , it 's a rich region but only a few people get the money ) and it 's still autonomous . 
  and the us gives support to the ypg despite erdogan 's constant whining . 
  no , it 's going to take turkey 's role in nato . 
  first of all , turkey is only allowed to close the straits for countries they 're at war with . 
  second , russia has been trying to provoke turkey to make a first move . 
  if they do , nato wo n't defend them . 
  this is a very fine line they 're walking and erdogan does n't seem to be handling it too well . 
  defending is the point of nato . 
  and they 're woth even less . 
  the number of soldiers does n't mean they have a capable army . 
  it 's only good in the context of the middle east . 
  an autonomous kurd region seems more and more possibly every day . 
  they could take the role of turkey . 
  which has nothing to do with nato . 
  turkey ca n't block the straits unless they 're in war . 
  well , maybe instead of calling them dumbfuck , you could try to show them how to use it for their own benefits . 
  if you 're serious , [ hortob\u00e1gy national park ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hortob%c3%a1gy_national_park ) is a great place . 
  it 's a [ unesco world heritage site ] ( http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/474 ) site too . 
  the uk is the most ~ ~ surveilled ( ? 
  ) ~ ~ viewed country in the world . 
  they are n't . 
  big areas of the great hungarian plain are national parks or nature reserves . 
  hungary and sweden should be on your graph . 
   since when did we talk about treatment of refugees ? 
  i do n't think that matters in this discussion . 
  how does that not matter ? 
  there is a big difference between sending people into the desert to die and then forget about them and actually taking care of them . 
  that 's the whole point . 
  like , literally the only thing that matters . 
   most of all refugees are staying within their country because it is a ) extremely dangerous and b ) extremely expensive to leave your home country . 
  which explains why afghanistan is on the list . 
  this does n't make too much sense , does it ? 
  rural communities had nothing to do with this . 
  it was just after the end of the industrial revolution that saw the world clearing out entire forests . 
  the first graph somehow , but conviniently , leaves out some [ european countries ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34131911 ) with higher numbers . 
  [ in lebanon ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/03/lebanon-formal-refugee-camps-syrians-150310073219002.html ) they get literally nothing . 
  it 's every man for himself . 
  [ in jordan ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/jordan/11782770/what-is-life-like-inside-the-largest-syrian-refugee-camp-zaatari-in-jordan.html ) they put them in the middle of a fucking desert and leave them there . 
  nobody gives a shit about the people there . 
  there 's something fishy with your second graph . 
  afghanistan having more refugees than we 're having refugees of afghan origin here ? 
  as a matter of fact , entire [ europe has become a lot more forested ] ( http://i.imgur.com/eabkelo.png?1 ) in the past 100 years . 
  except hungarian is not even mentioned in that article . 
  the question is not whether or not we could . 
  the question is whether or not we want to deal with the consequences . 
  and the answer is a clear no . 
  there are no available videos on the internet . 
  i can post hungarian articles with embedded youtube videos that are all removed . 
  i 'm late for the party but anyway . 
  do you all remember that hungarian reporter who tripped a refugee ? 
  she was publicly shamed and attacked all over the western media . 
  they even made a facebook page demanding she get fired . 
  there was another video from a different angle . 
  she did n't even touch that bastard . 
   dead centre of europe not even close . 
   our politicians are looking up to you as an example on how not to do things . 
  did n't your pm said about a week ago that the problem is bigger than they admit ? 
  there was a video here where he said europe is in danger and we should close the borders . 
  if you have n't already , then check out this british series , called [ utopia ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2384811/ ) . 
  you need to watch at least the first season to understand why i 'm saying this . 
  so all we have to do is wait until 2100 ?
