  who knew ? 
  let 's have them over here for a party then . 
  do you really think that all your statistics in this thread will make the problem go away ? 
  because nobody ever talks about cricket outside the commonwealth but americans just ca n't shut up about one-foot-long ball . 
   are you suggesting we should 've halted the air campaign completely because of the possibility of human shields i mean , that 's exactly what you were expecting from the russians in syria . 
  double standard much ? 
  it is a state secret . 
  its morality is a whole another question . 
  there 's a saying in my country : `` it 's better to be scared than to get scared . '', 
  so , it 's better to be prepared and not get attacked than to get attacked and not be prepared . 
  for me it does n't make a difference how a terrorist got into europe . 
  what 's disinformation ? 
  well , the paris attackers were isis members , who made the trip to syria and back . 
  that 's enough evidence for me . 
  this is a bigger ad hominem than the previous one . 
  if you have nothing to add to the discussion than you should n't be talking at all . 
  now try to come up with something better !, 
  this is the stupidest argument , i 've heard . 
  people commit all sorts of things that are illegal . 
  should we just make everything legal and be done with it ? 
  that dude in the vatican does n't live in austria . 
  he might visit it on some occasions but that 's a huge difference . 
   and what if austria wants a different guy as the big boss of the catholic church , because they do n't like what he preaches ? 
  this has happened a few times in europe . 
  did n't work out too well , did it ? 
  one quarter of brussels population is immigrants . 
  yeah , well dishonest talk about european wide problems is a lot worse than hurting people 's feeling . 
  but that 's just my opinion . 
  that 's not how politics works . 
  you 're assuming goodwill from the other party . 
  with the russians there ? 
  yes , you do . 
  [ how about this one ? 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/17/us-f22-jets-south-korea-air-force-north-seoul-flyover ), 
   ee politicians should really tone down a little bit . 
  or not . 
  i ca n't say i care for the political correctness of the west . 
  if you have something on your mind , fucking say it . 
  that 's freedom of speech in motion . 
   means that the state of turkey is incompetent as fuck no , it means that turkey finally has a cassus belli and can invade syria without consequences . 
  there would be a million people living segregated in different part of the city . 
  i 'm not saying anything . 
  they asked for proof , i provided it . 
  that 's it . 
  none of those things will give you 100 % protection . 
  the anonym internet days are over . 
  they were fun but we have to let them go . 
  so , who is blameshifting now ? 
  hungary did n't deport a single jewish person until the germans occupied the country in ** march 1944 ** and it was stopped by horthy in ** july 1944 ** . 
  it was n't even 5 full months . 
  what do you mean as proof ? 
  the fact that last year half the asylum seekers were from safe countries ? 
  or that 3/4th of them were males of which the majority were 18-34 ? 
  or that they 're violating every single international agreement by not applying for asylum in the first safe country ? 
  no , russia did that to opec . 
  saudi arabia is a member of opec . 
  but that was nothing new from russia . 
  opec did the same thing with a member state . 
  that 's a very big difference . 
  thrown under the bus by opec . 
  and now they do n't have a choice but to cut production in an attempt to raise the price . 
  but since they do n't trust opec they 're now turning to russia and that goes to show how desperate they 're . 
  there were exit-nods operated by intelligence agencies . 
  i have n't used tor in years but i would n't trust it with my secrets . 
  the saudis do n't have a choice . 
  the last time they cut production ( and agreed with opec that they would too ) they were thrown under the bus . 
  now they 're losing money by the billions and they do n't trust their partners and they 're involved in a war they do n't seem to be able to handle . 
  they desperately need russia . 
  vpn providers will give out all your information without a question if a government tells them to . 
  it 's usually even in their terms and conditions . 
  tor , while a lot more secure still not an omnipotent solution and they will find you there too if they really want to . 
  neither does turkey . 
  http://www.politico.eu/article/turkey-buzzes-weakened-greece-military-airspace/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hatay_province https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cyprus#1974_coup.2c_turkish_invasion_and_division, 
  officially syria has been in a war with israel for like 50 years . 
  yeah , it 's not like hezbollah soldiers are running around with m16s or isis has an immense ammount of humvees or the syrian rebels are using us supplied manpads . 
  instead watch the citizens get behedead in propaganda videos . 
  we did n't just try , we succeded . 
  the serbian border is closed . 
  you have an irish flag . 
  and you 're asking what 's better than forcing something on people ? 
   well , it is a solution . 
  it 's not . 
  you think it is because of the history of your country , but democracy is just as good as the political parties make it to be . 
  do you really think there 's a functioning democracy in the us ? 
  in the `` bastion of freedom '' ? 
  i do n't . 
   but only if the people come to it on their own . 
  exactly . 
  i 've followed the syrian civil war and other countries since 2011 ( the arab spring ) and i can tell you with confidence that neither in syria , nor in other arab countries do they want or are ` ready ' ( i put this in qoutes because i do n't think it is or should be a goal for some countries ) for democracy . 
  no , it is n't . 
  it works well in some parts of the world . 
  but even , here in europe it took a long time to make it work . 
  but many arab countries have parts where tribalism is still well and alive . 
  you ca n't force a form of government on people just because you think it 's good . 
  i do n't think democracy is an ultimate solution for all the problems around the world . 
  only if you get rid of merkel . 
  and promise not to elect any austrian . 
  that 's a stupid thing and must 've started in one of the subs where teenagers with functional illiteracy are in the majority . 
  i 'm pretty sure that was a sarcastic comment . 
  we could just start our own mini eu .
