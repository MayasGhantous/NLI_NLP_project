  is that sarcasm ? 
  the cluj napuca station was built way before the soviet era and it looks nice and clean based on the video . 
  if you knew what tourists see when they arrive to budapest , our god damn capital , now that 's some disgusting shit . 
  weather in hungary from september to march makes me want to slice my wrists , so anywhere nice and warm is okay . 
  good thing hungary sucks at everything , at least everyone 's shitty complaints are justified . 
  where ? 
  in grocery stores it 's like 120ft . 
  yeah , an other map confirming that hungary became the kid with the down syndrome in the v4 group . 
  in a few months we will be closer to the balkan states than to other v4 members , lol, 
  hungary : -0,8 % business as usual, 
  excessive hunting before the 20th century , now there are barely any forests where the population could recover, 
  `` better '' is just enough to consolidate our position as an underdeveloped balkan country, 
  `` higher growth compared to the eu average ? 
  hungarian reforms are working '', 
  seeing the poverty and neglect all over the country , there is nothing excessive about this, 
  incompetence and corruption, 
  nah , i want more billboards telling me that we are performing better . 
  hungary underperforming , as always nothing new here, 
  the sand was ... very evil . 
  dog : vau vau cat : miau cow : m\u00fa duck : h\u00e1p h\u00e1p pig : that noise you make in the back of your throat roaster : kukurik\u00fa i have no idea about the rest, 
  in addition to the airplane tickets i received 20 000 sheckels for today 's protest from master soros, 
  they can move to rich countries, 
  considering 4 out of 7 hungarian nuts 2 regions are among the eu 's top 10 poorest , `` right now '' is a safe bet, 
  also `` local hungarian producer '' is 50 % dutch, 
  i 'm not even mad . 
  average `` i 'm insecure about my penis size so i 'm going to lie '' in europe, 
  i would n't be surprised, 
  in hungary we are equally poor, 
  these towns are what i liked about germany the most . 
  unfortunately i did n't make it to rothenburg because it seemed to be impossible to go there with public transport ( from mannheim ) , but heidelberg , ladenburg , neustadt an der weinstra\u00dfe , bad wimpfen , bensheim , and all those beautiful places in the rhein-neckar region made up for it . 
  tfw hungary is closer to romania than to the czech republic when it comes to gdp/capita . 
  they did ? 
  sure , but it 's not like the hungarian political elite did n't have an influence on the ** common ** foreign policy, 
   hungary had no say in foreign policy what you realize the empire had 4 hungarian foreign ministers, 
  in hungary it 's one of the most popular tv shows since the late 90s, 
  lots of everyday products in germany are way cheaper than in hungary for example , can of tuna in german lidl : 1 $ ( 310huf ) same can of tuna in hungarian lidl : 450huf and do n't even get me started on the product selection ... 
  holding hands in public , existing, 
  it 's just some guy , his outfit looks way too modern for a hungarian soldier, 
  ah , good old fremdsch\u00e4men, 
  nice job cleaning that mess up . 
  many areas of budapest still look like the first pic . 
  because reasons although i do n't see anyone using roman numbers in dates anymore, 
  temirtau , kazakhstan ( the graffiti is based on `` la danse '' , by henri matisse ), 
  quality soil = / = quality agriculture . 
  hungarians always boast about how valuable our land is and we have to protect it from evil austrian farmers yet markets and stores are full of sub-par quality crap . 
  what about the martyrs or arad , many of whom were born outside the kingdom of hungary , to armenian/croatian/german / austrian/etc parents ? 
  or istv\u00e1n sz\u00e9chenyi for that matter , who was born in vienna , and struggled with the hungarian language ? 
  yet i do n't think anyone disputes the identity of these people . 
  this is hilarious considering many hungarian national heroes were born outside the country and/or barely spoke the language . 
  i lived in germany ... noticed more blondes and turks compared to hungary but that 's it ... 
  i 've been to other countries as well but i did n't spend enough time to judge the local female population lol . 
  idk . . maybe they 're not ? 
  you have attractive and less attractive women like in any other country . 
  imo what makes it unique to other historical cities on rivers is having a hill on one side with beautiful buildings overlooking the city , heidelberg altstadt comes to mind with a similar layout but that 's very tiny in comparison . 
  if people were proud the city would n't look so dirty and neglected in most areas, 
  [ relevant ] ( http://static.fjcdn.com/large/pictures/e0/70/e07016_1006357.jpg ), 
  do n't worry , we are joining in, 
  +1 i randomly signed up for a semester in germany ( i had low expectations because two of my friends were recently on erasmus and they hated it ) , it ended up redeeming the whole shitty college experience for me . 
  i still feel sad about coming back . 
  i ca n't recommend it enough , especially if you have no tuition at your home university , then you have nothing to lose . 
  it pisses me of that this was the first thing people asked me when i came back from erasmus , not which places i 've seen , what kind of people i 've met , what 's it like to live there , etc . . except my family , they know i 'm hopeless and my answer would be no . 
  hungary reporting in !, 
  [ i know right ] ( http://ocdn.eu/images/pulscms/ogi7mdmsmmu0ldasmswx/b23967b29ebffa5a3abe2c4ac44e58f0.jpeg ), 
  is it ? 
  alright communism was rough but nowadays you can enjoy the goodies from both sides . 
  ( live in hungary and work in austria ) no wonder employers have a hard time finding anybody to work for them in western-hungary . 
  i knew this was only a matter of time . 
  to put it in perspective : everyday products cost the same or even less compared hungary . 
  ( with an average income of 2300 $ vs 600 $ ) . 
  hungarians are poor as shit . 
  hungary fucking sucking at something compared to the rest of cee , nothing new . 
  germany, 
  neglect and decay everywhere , depressed people , toxic social atmosphere . 
  i hate the fact that i have to go back there after finishing my studies abroad . 
  what 's wrong with skyscrapers outside the historical city centre ? 
  yes . 
  hungarian voters who never set their feet abroad and only gain information from mass media . 
   improvised temporary pubs yeah . . `` temporary '' :(, 
  imo it blends in nicely , a great achievement for something built in the 1970s [ this ] ( http://media.funiq.hu/images/68/2a/14354_orig_art721.jpg ) on the other hand ... absolutely disgusting, 
  unpopular hungarian opinion : bland t\u00far\u00f3 rudi sucks , fruit fillings all the way, 
  wake up mr. freeman . . wake up and smell the asheees . 
  he confuses it with budapest / s, 
  i could n't give less shits about lte speeds when the coverage is so bad i 'm praying for at least a steady 2g connection while traveling in the countryside, 
  not surprised , regarding cellular data hungary is in the stone age, 
  `` but muh pure hungarian blood '', 
  do you even austria-hungary bro, 
  over 70 % of the populace is pro eu , there is no general defiance . 
  ( 90 % under the age of 30 ) and about 25 % of the eligible voters chose orban . 
  people just do n't think there is an alternative . 
  stop spreading shit . 
  of course it was against the ceu . 
  nobody cared about international schools and fake diplomas until soros became the boogeyman . 
  then , suddenly the state propaganda ( origo ) `` aquired '' a report that `` the soros university ( ! ), 
  is violating hungarian laws '' ( it did n't ) do you actually believe the crap you are saying ? 
   when you get to the public vote , we do n't actually see which country voted for which countries , which let 's face it , is half the fun in eurovision . 
   `` see , mom , those balkan jerks always vote for eachother !! '', 
  meanwhile the hungarian state funded media writing articles about how the leaders of the uk , france , germany , and italy have no children , while orb\u00e1n has 5 . 
  everyday i 'm surprised that the country can sink even lower . 
  because western populists can use it for `` muh eastern autocrats '' while eastern populists can use it for `` muh western liberals '', 
  db is expensive and unreliable .
