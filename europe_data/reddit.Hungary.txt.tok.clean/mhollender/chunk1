budapest does n't look more run-down than cities in western europe at all . 
  that is largely because western cities are pretty ran down too . 
  and i do n't understand why they accept it ... 
  i mean we thought it is just a commie thing , that our cities here are ran down , and as we develop we will fix them . 
  but western cities are also often quite ran down and they do n't fix them either . 
  why do they tolerate it ? 
  it is so weird . 
  why do n't people in i.e. 
  paris insist to the return to [ haussmann 's high standards of the past ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haussmann%27s_renovation_of_paris ) ? 
  i really think rich countries should only tolerate two kinds of buildings 1 ) brand sparking new 2 ) old and in excellent shape : fresh paint , no rotting remains of posters , no `` tags '' etc. 
  i mean , if i was rich , that is how my houses would look like :-), 
  this ... is interesting . 
  i do n't know about brussels , but generally in budapest the hospitals are bad and patients have to bring things like toilet paper with them because they have no budget , the buses often lack air conditioning in the summer , most subways have no elevators so if you have baby in a pram you are stuck , so there these signs of the lack of money to put into developing things everywhere . 
  let me formulate it this way . 
  the more money the elites can steal out of the budget that could be used to build roads or hospitals , they nicer cars they buy with it . 
  a car journalist once wrote `` in budapest everybody has one category more expensive car than what they could actually afford . '', 
  true , i think . 
  there is a strong social pressure to `` show off '' and try to look succesful and wealthy , even when you buy the car on credit on top of another credit on the mortgaged flat ... 
  is this our old friend , the gema ? 
  dunno , never really used it beyond sharing baby photos with relatives . 
  what do the `` in '' people use today ? 
  that 's really decent !, 
  thanks for the info . 
  if they were born there , like sz\u00e9kelys , they are probably doing that on purpose just to troll ya :-) classic sz\u00e9kely joke from a stand-up comedy i saw : `` i really had to learn romanian when i was 18 and needed a driving licence , i still know the list of rule violations e.g. 
  running a red light , not what they actually mean , just how much points they cost . '', 
  thanks , i now found them in a burgenlander dictionary , apparently - for obvious historical reasons - mostly used there . 
  the reason is simply that the future is unpredictable , anything could happen . 
  i would certainly not carry a gun now , nor would i sleep with it , i feel safe now . 
  but who knows what happens in the future , it would be nice to be allowed to have a .38 stored away , just in case something truly unpredictable happens . 
  but , to be fair , countries like hungary where sports shooting permits are fairly easy to get are a good compromise . 
  while carrying it loaded , or even storing it loaded is not allowed , only in separate locked cabinets , the point is , what i meant by the `` unpredictable '' is some sort of a social collapse . 
  in that case you would not obey those laws anyway . 
  putting it differently , as long as civilization works well enough to make you obey the law to store them separate , it also works well enough to not really need to carry or use it . 
  so if i lived back home in hungary i would probably do sports shooting and store it separately , lawfully . 
  i live in austria and generally do n't do this , because i think a foreign citizen should not do such things , it is very easy to break some obscure law you never even heard about , so do this on home field only . 
  i spent a really cold new years eve party in hot thermal outdoor pool in hungary , the general rule is that it heats up your skin and body so that you can get out for 2-3 mins to take a pee and not feel any cold . 
  however never get your hair wet . 
  it will freeze and maybe give you a cold . 
  if you ever get it wet you have to get it wet again with hot water every minute and that is annoying . 
  i do n't know of that many hungarian influences , other than gatlihosen and maschek , and i am hungarian dude who lives in vienna for 7 years . 
  the other way around yes , lot of vienna slang was translated into budapest slang , so i can translate those terms back and use it in viennese german , most of them are insults  pancser - pantscher , strici - strizzi , fusi - pfuscher and so on . 
  slavic and yiddish are more likely influences . 
  in fact a czech -  viennese -  hungarian chain often happened , such as mo\u010dka -  motschga -  mocskos , mocsok , or fr\u0148\u00e1k -  pfrnak -  firny\u00e1k . 
  due to the growing hungarian community in vienna , there is an interesting mixed slang developing . 
  such as putting nicknames on train stations , because we see them so often ( visiting family home every month ) . 
  meidling -  v\u00e1jdling , from weitling , a large bowl used for washing dishes . 
  westbahnhof -  westbanya , banya is hungarian for `` witch '' , from an old word that actually used to mean grandmother . 
  i also like turkish-german slang , babo , lan , it just sounds cool . 
  of the ones i speak , german . 
  very precise and expressive , also blunt . 
  but fuck all that noise about conjugations and declinations , i still have to look up the gender of verbs when i write e-mails and i am living like 7 years now in vienna and still do n't get it . 
  i think some dialects here just say `` des '' instead of all the complicated artikels and i like that . 
  `` des funkt net '' is basically the average support call in vienna . 
  `` de schaas funkt net '' is a , you could say , support call expressed with more urgency . 
  also , if you know 100 % when to use als vs. wie , you 're a like a reincarnation of goethe because it seems like nobody does . 
  of the ones i do n't , italian . 
  i do understand some latin and out of the various butcherings of that magnificent language , italian seems to be the most elegant . 
  perhaps portuguese a close second . 
  castilian i.e. 
  spanish sounds a bit hard and military to me , and french is just ... weird . 
  like as if the ortography had no relation to the pronounciation at all . 
  public open air swimming pools in that kind of climate , people sunbathing and all on ** ice ** land ? 
  so why could n't i find anything like that when i lived in the uk , which has milder weather ? 
  let 's try ... a fitting game , europa universalis 4 ? 
  for a waiter the cost of commuting is not steep , because he will never afford anything but renting a room , like a student in a flatshare , and that as well may be near to the job . 
  nobody even tries to buy a house or something on a waiter 's wage . 
  unfortunately a german dude just died because a huge tree branch fell on him while packing up . 
  probably weakened by the storm . 
  folks , take the [ no camping beyond this point ] ( https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--ka3kfjiv--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/1389463163412046373.jpg ) signs seriously . 
  it means beyond that point nobody has cut down the dangerously weakened trees . 
  although i agree that with so many people there maybe they should fix up the trees on the whole island . 
  i think now they will - you know how it works , it always takes one tragedy before something gets paid attention to . 
   the scandinavians left scandinavia because it was so cold and dark and decided to settle in one of the coldest and darkest regions in the us . 
  see also the finnish americans , it is really funny , their [ settlement patterns ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/pct_finnish4.png ) look like a magnetic attraction to cold and dark . 
  this is why i do n't believe when northern people say they would prefer a southern weather . 
  no they do n't , it is just some sort of a polite saying . 
  all these guys on the picture had a chance to live in california and just look at the picture , they are almost knocking at the canadian border . 
  i think you do n't wear prescription glasses . 
  or found a way to install windscreen vipers on them . 
  there is one theory that the word chav came from gypsy / roma language word `` chavo '' or `` shavo '' meaning `` man '' or `` boy '' . 
  i support a kind of europe where `` keep your nose out of other people 's business '' is a strong and seriously taken rule . 
  and it is a classic case of none of my business . 
  i do n't consider this pot traditional . 
  at least it is not really a budapest thing . 
  also the paprika bits look odd , at least i have never seen lecso and p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt mixed . 
  i think this may be one of the rural `` dialects '' of p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt . 
  as there are many different version as per parts of the country ... 
  i remember picking up a book of scotland 's history where it said english was already so widespread centuries before the act of union that one nobleman taunted the other in a well known poem around 1500 saying `` you are so backwards you do n't even speak english '' . 
  i wondered why . 
  then i digged more and it turned out it is because the normans did not stop at the northern border of england , they got in ... not directly , not as conquerors , but somehow much of the scottish nobility still became normann , e.g. 
  robert the bruce or de bruys was also norman on the father 's line . 
  basically just one of his ancestors was [ good friends with the scottish king ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robert_de_brus,_1st_lord_of_annandale#scotland ) , that is how they got in . 
  then i digged more and then i found that already in 650 the anglo-saxon kingdom of northumbria went all the way up to edinburgh . 
  so , scots is a germanic language because english influence exists in the lowlands a good thousand years earlier than the act of union . 
  this is at least what i found . 
  i liked the southwest most . 
  exeter etc. 
  which really suggests a pan-european consciousness is far away . 
  it seems we can not find interesting topics to discuss beyond our cultural and linguistic differences . 
  very high class in hungary , near budapest , in commute distance ( nobody lives _ in _ budapest , too many people in there  ) , check out these pics : http://www.ingatlan-buda.hu/adatlap/elado/csaladi/8069 indoor swimming pool and a fucking statue in the garden to max out the class level .
