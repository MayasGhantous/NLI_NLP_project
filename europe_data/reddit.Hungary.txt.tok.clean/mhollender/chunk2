  the challenge at visiting italy is getting away from the places where all the other twenty million tourists are . 
  last time we were in pietrasanta which does not count like a win in this regard , it is was pretty touristy . 
  then we figured we will get away and visit an `` authentic etruscan mountain village '' . 
  i do n't remember where we were but i think roggio because this pic looks familiar : https://mw2.google.com/mw-panoramio/photos/medium/18888427.jpg in that region , anyway . 
  this was truly authenthic because the locals were super nice , not tired from seeing too many tourists , nobody spoke any of the languages we do . 
  finally they somehow managed to explain us somehow that the tavern is closed until evening . 
  so we looked around and drove back . 
  any idea how the fsck to survive playing your country in europa universalis 4 ? 
  especially the 1579 start ? 
  there was a strike when i tried to go by train from paris to rouen and 300 people stood in a queue because only 1 ticket sales window worked on st.lazar . 
  and then the people started chanting `` plus-vite !, 
  this was ... gloriously impertinent . 
  it really changed my impression of western europe . 
  people there usually just suffer in silence and not complain even when they have all the rights to ... this was different , almost as refreshingly impolite as here . 
  they are an island . 
  really interesting . 
  then it looks like it was not just an idea created by some entrepreneurs , but either the government or an alliance of entrepreneurs organized it all ? 
  what i hate about vat rate changes is that i used to support some retail stores and when there is a change , re-labeling all the products with new prices is just too much work for them . 
  especially when it changes in the new year , so they should have old prices on 31 dec and new prices on 2nd jan ( 1st jan closed ) . 
  so what do they do , they have me write a program that changes the net price so that even with the new vat rate the gross price stays the same . 
  which is fine . 
  the bad part is when i have to run that program on 1st jan. 
  but would n't be better to drink all that bushmills instead of burning it in a rocket ? 
  kinda explains linus torvalds . 
  afaik `` hipster '' here in the eastern countries largely means `` poor looking '' and with that not that cool . 
  hipsters are more interested in buying a retro bike . 
  i think people around these countries still at the phase of worshipping armani jeans and d & g and i think a bmw , even if you can only afford a 15 years old one , makes you cooler here than a retro bike . 
  i am not 100 % sure as i am not that young anymore to care about fashion . 
  i could be outdated by 10-15 years easy since i am 37 and after 25 you are never cool anymore :-) but i still see a lot of versace and vutton people in the shopping malls in hungary , not hipsters . 
  this is hilarious . 
  thanks !, 
  etiquette ? 
  he was n't thirsty . 
  but it looks like a worm / maggot folks , strange how only we see it ... 
  i like these vids , i am not 100 % sure if they are russian ( could be belo or ukr as well ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1grhhpm2ms, 
  interesting . 
  somehow they never really got that popular here , as we were lusting for western stuff . 
  so i learned to like robert heinlein and larry niven , i think there is a lot of philosophy in their writings , i can recommend the quotes pages : https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/robert_a._heinlein https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/larry_niven from the eastern block i like zsoldos p\u00e9ter but i think he was not translated to other languages . 
  i remember reading one russian sci-fi , forgot the name , it was something like station no . 
  5 or something similar ? 
  it was a bit surreal . 
  example . 
  make a directory like `` filemassageforsap14082015 '' . 
  make subdirectories : code , input , output , doc . 
  copy data files into input subdir . 
  make a readme.xt in the doc subdir . 
  go to the code subdir . 
  write code . 
  execute it . 
  check the output subdirectory . 
  read the files . 
  see if they are right . 
  repeat . 
  i think that is a nice , organized way to work ? 
  and all this withouth touching a mouse . 
  i do n't know i would do it without an orthodox file manager . 
  click around with the mouse ? 
  too slow . 
  write mkdir into bash ? 
  to easy to make mistakes . 
  how would you do it ? 
  somehow it never gave me that native nc feel ... 
  i think the main reason is nobody used windows 1 , 2 , 3 , 3.1 here , but held out in dos until win 95 came around or even a bit longer - i think i used dos until 1996-97 . 
  and dos = norton , that is clear ... and of course the whole unix , linux thing i.e. 
  emacs was almost unavaible here due to cocom list restrictions and not being connected to the western computer networks until 1991 . 
  so dos it was . 
  how do you notice germans ? 
  i mean , if they speak in a bavarian accent , that is pretty close ... 
  [ far manager !!!, 
  ] ( http://www.farmanager.com/screenshots.php?l=en ) holy shit . 
  it is a godsend . 
  thank you very much , eugene roshal !, 
  this is the only software that makes living in a windows operating system survivable for old ms-dos i.e. 
  norton commander heads . 
  it also does syntax highlighting ( colorer plugin is now installed by standard ) and it is excellent for progammers who have a different programming style than the mainstream . 
  mainstream programming style is working in the editor : i start visua studio , open a file , and edit it . 
  then compile and run it . 
  this is good for programmers who e.g. 
  build applications . 
  but many programmers do n't work like that . 
  generally those who do not build applications , but work with data . 
  for example imagine a task like being told to take these text and csv files and write scripts to change and validate their data and import them into a database . 
  how do you work with them ? 
  these programmers like to work with files first and foremost , moving , copying , renaming , executing them . 
  and from the file manager , they want to open a file in an editor , enter a line or two , and then go back to copying , executing etc. 
  files . 
  and far is far better for this task than visual studio or eclipse or even emacs ( although you could install a manager plugin into emacs ) . 
  far makes you _ own _ your files , not poking at them with a long stick . 
  eugene also made rar , which is also great job , but that less important to me , i just use zip . 
  the [ copper dick owl ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ya49fzes0ek/hqdefault.jpg ) . 
  an owl with a huge penis made of brass or copper . 
  [ another pic . 
  ] ( http://www.irodalmijelen.hu/sites/default/files/field/image/r%c3%a9zfasz%c3%ba.jpg ) no actually , this is a joke-folklore , this is used jokingly . 
  as in , jokingly scaring a bigger kid ( who can take vulgar language ) `` behave or the copper dick owl will kidnap you ! '', 
  this actually comes from male doctors doing abortions with copper tools . 
  owl = educated man wearing eyeglasses . 
  copper dick = copper instrument that goes in the ... [ hungarian source ] ( http://www.irodalmijelen.hu/05242013-1554/rezfaszu-bagolytol-nagy-szekely-marketingfogasig ), 
  ok , that is genuinely interesting ... is it perhaps legislation ? 
  in portuguese laws it was easier to get work permit for them than , say , in german laws ? 
  well , there _ are _ some sports bars here with large tv screens ...
