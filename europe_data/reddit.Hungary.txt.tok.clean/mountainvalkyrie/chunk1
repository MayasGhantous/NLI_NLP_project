oh , i did n't know that . 
  the green symbolizes hope and/or pasture land , by the way . 
  thanks for the tip . 
  i was just visiting a ( danish ) friend there , but i could n't help but notice the flags everywhere . 
  it 's a nice flag , though , i must say . 
   they 're flag crazy . 
  i noticed this , too . 
  flags on birthday cakes !, 
  flags on christmas trees !, 
  i asked someone about it and he said it 's more a commercial thing or the flag as a `` pretty decoration '' than patriotic . 
  something like , `` how shall we decorate this stupid cake ? 
  oh , i do n't know , throw some flags on it or whatever . '', 
  that 's just one opinion , though , so ... 
  people mix up beethoven with mozart . 
  [ mozart 's nationality ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mozart%27s_nationality ) can be debated . 
  thank you for the explanation !, 
  i 've always wondered what stopped him from going farther south into judea . 
  was he on friendly terms with the people ? 
  fought back ? 
  saw no reason to grab a bunch of desert ? 
  ah , thanks . 
  i wonder why people stopped . 
  i did n't fly before 2000 and then only rarely until 2007-ish . 
  even now that i 've flown quite a bit ( within europe ) , i 've never seen anyone but georgians do it . 
  i thought maybe the habit came from giving extra praise to any pilot who manages to land an aeroflot plane safely . 
   clapping when the plane lands georgians do that , too ... 
  you should visit !, 
  it 's great . 
  i 've spent quite a bit of time there . 
  wonderful people . 
  and you can see the same kind of architecture as in budapest and vienna ( although unfortunately they do n't have the budget to get it all restored ) . 
  the nature is also lovely and stryisky park is easy to get to from the city center . 
  i do n't know about the beer , but if you like vodka , khortytsa is definitely worth a try . 
  well ... he did n't say she * ate * a pizza , only that she * wanted * a pizza . 
   but danes are probably considered slightly more approachable than the colder norwegians . 
  i think this is mostly what my friend meant . 
  that norwegians tend to be quieter , shier , more reserved in a similar way to finns , whereas danes tend to be more expressive and out-going . 
  but i also wonder if i got that impression because i spent summer in denmark ( see , it 's not just you guys ) and winter in norway , and people are just moodier and less sociable in winter . 
  seriously , though , this is exactly what a finnish friend of mine told me when i said i find danes so much more relatable than norwegians ( thinking they should be similar cultures ) . 
  `` well , danes are continentals like you ... '', 
  good point . 
  that 45c was in jordan , so definitely dry . 
  it affects you more when you 're not used to it . 
  i spent a lot of time in the near/middle east and could walk around in 45c with little trouble . 
  the first year i came back to europe , i so tired all that winter from the relative dark and cold . 
  now it 's reversed . 
  now -20 c is no problem , but anything over 20c ... no thanks . 
  i still read it as `` football hooligans ( of any country ) . '', 
  but yeah , i agree if they meant all poles , that 's ridiculous . 
  i 'm assuming he/she meant the particular individuals who did this , not the entire country of poland . 
  stopping recruitment may not be why she 's doing it . 
  she may be doing it to make the people it 's directed at ( jews , gypsies , whoever ) feel a little less shitty as they take their daily walks around town . 
  if you 're into metal , you might be interested in this [ finnish dna-profile-based music ] ( http://www.visitfinland.com/symphonyofextremes/#intro ) being planned for the end of the year . 
  apocalyptica 's writing it . 
  it seems to be something to attract attention from foreigners , though , because there 's no finnish version of the site ( or maybe it 's out there , but i have n't found it ) . 
  just thought i 'd mention it . 
  i have no idea about that . 
  although i * think * i remember my friend commenting that drivers in lviv were nice about looking out for pedestrians . 
   people do n't obligate to traffic code ( driving in ukraine was a really bad experience ) a finnish friend of mine recently visited me in lviv ( i spend a lot of time there ) and he said driving was `` like in spain . '', 
  so , quite disorganized compared to finland . 
  but yes , the roads . 
  you notice it even driving in from romania . 
  he also liked the strawberries and noted that they 're probably organic , judging by their appearance . 
  also , that the chicken has real flavour . 
  the food here really is quite good , both the cuisine and the raw ingredients available . 
  sorry to hear about the language thing , though . 
  i love this holiday !, 
  one year , a couple guys poured * two whole buckets * of water on me from the balcony of the hotel shirak in yerevan . 
  i could n't see exactly where they were pouring from and i was waiting to cross the street , so i could n't really avoid them . 
  not that i really cared . 
  of course , it helps that when its 38c out , you * want * someone to pour water on you . 
  ( i mean that seriously . ), 
  nah , he was non-religious `` culturally jewish . '', 
  he 'd come on a press trip to learn about the jewish community and i happened to ask what he thought of the synagogue ... and he had n't seen it . 
  so i took him around to see some things . 
  he was * pissed * that they had n't shown it to him . 
  but i know what you mean . 
  the smaller [ synagogue on rumbach street ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/rumbachfotothalertamas10.jpg/1280px-rumbachfotothalertamas10.jpg ) was built because some people did n't like the organs in the main synagogue . 
  glad you enjoyed it !, 
  hope you can came back sometime . 
  spring and autumn probably are the best times ; summer 's humid and winter lacks snow . 
  yes , she is [ quite faboulous ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/0e/94/d4/0e94d41fc3efc4c58f520ab0a37f2fbe.jpg ) . 
  yes , and third biggest in the world after jerusalem 's belz great synagogue and then one in new york , i think . 
  i took a british-jewish acquaintance to see it once and as we walked out in front of it , he stopped , stared and said , `` my god , it 's a jewish cathedral ! '', 
  my personal favorite description so far . 
  this photo makes it look a * little * bigger than it is , though , imo . 
  quite a lot , actually . 
  the particular `` far rightists '' in this article seem fairly off their hinges , but i 've met some far-ish right people ( jobbik supporters ) who are the type that say `` those other jews '' ( soros et al , i suppose ) are the bag guys , but your regular neighbours and co-workers who are jewish , well , they 're perfectly fine and no one should ever harm them . 
  we have quite a few gypsy and jewish people , whom i doubt this lot considers `` white '' . 
  that said , i agree with the person above who said the look like an insignificant group of school kids . 
  i was going to say i 'd rather be a southern drunken mongol , but then i saw your username ... 
  see ... even then , 50 % of people being afraid sounds crazy . 
  i 've walked through the 8th district at like , 2 am , and never had a problem . 
  i used to live in the 6ths and 7th . 
  walked all over . 
  never had a problem . 
  only two times i 've * ever * been bothered at night were in the 9th and 19th . 
  still feel perfectly safe walking at night . 
  i will say , i felt * much * less safe walking home in oslo ( was there for 3 months ) . 
  it 's got to be largely perception .
