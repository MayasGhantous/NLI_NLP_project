  we just had a spying scandal involving a jobbik candidate ( b\u00e9la kov\u00e1cs ) . 
  http://www.euronews.com/2014/05/16/right-wing-hungarian-politician-bela-kovacs-suspected-of-being-russian-spy/ http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/sb10001424052702304422704579572093087362958?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fonline.wsj.com%2farticle%2fsb10001424052702304422704579572093087362958.html, 
  we have `` tesco value '' brand . 
  at least they do n't pretend to be `` great value '' . 
  it would n't be that ironic . 
  even stalin supported hungary 's revisionist policies before ww2 . 
  i have to stress though that current hungary has no territorial dispute with its neighbors , and i do n't think orban 's words should be interpreted that way . 
  they won in 90 % of the districts . 
   i do n't really consider that a huge mandate . 
  sounds funny from an american who has first-past-the-post election system . 
   fidesz gained only 45 % of the vote in the election this year , but got 2/3 of the seats because of the non-proportional electoral system . 
  fidesz got 2/3 in with the old election system in 2010 too . 
  also hungary never had a proportional voting system . 
  i expect stagnation , not failure . 
  orban 's hand is tied due to various eu regulations . 
  he does n't want to lose access to structural and cohesion funds . 
   orban 's party relies on hate of roma and other minorities to get some votes . 
  i would argue with that . 
  according to the surveys of t\u00e1rki , most romas vote for fidesz . 
  also , i do n't remember fidesz officials saying anti-roma things . 
  ( though you could find journalists who support fidesz to say such things . ), 
   should the cyprus situation be resolved , cyprus will almost certainly be for turkey joining the eu , and you can expect the important countries which are not warm to the idea of turkey joining becoming more vocal . 
  the human rights situation is pretty shitty in turkey . 
  their recent transgression set back them for at least a decade from joining . 
  they 're a much harder case than serbia . 
  are n't correctional facilities for criminals ? 
  translating `` lehel t\u00e9r '' to `` soul square '' is pretty stupid error . 
  lehel is an archaic surname and even if translated literally would mean `` to breathe '' . 
  `` little barley bridge '' is '' \u00c1rp\u00e1dh\u00edd '' , where \u00c1rp\u00e1d is also a name ( which is a common given name too ) , and even if you wanted to translate literally it would be `` your barley bridge '' . 
  i also do n't know where the `` welfare louis square '' comes from , at that place astoria is supposed to be . 
  pope john paul 2 square also does n't exist . 
  n\u00e9pszinh\u00e1z is supposed to be there , but it would translate as `` folk theatre '' . 
  would you elaborate on this ? 
   basically these guys ' clocks have stopped around wwi and they have no intention to move on . 
  familiar story . 
  eu wins with cultural hegemony . 
   i 'd agree with that but they removed themselves from the negotiations by their own actions and words . 
  would you elaborate on this ? 
  slovakia was a chopped up puppet state at the time though . 
   most students rent private flats , it 's usually cheaper and better . 
  i can hardly cheaper . 
  i paid $ 40 a month for hostel in budapest . 
  there was some mold in the toilet and the flooring was cheap plastic linoleum which was coming up in few places , but there were no cockroaches or pipe leaks . 
  you also get access to 60 mb internet for $ 3 a month . 
  ( dorm was renovated since then , it 's a bit more expensive , but still much cheaper than renting . ), 
   three american college students studying abroad are lured to a slovakian hostel , and discover the grim reality behind it . 
  except jobbik is n't part of a govenment coalition and never was . 
  i assumed it 's wrong because headlines always use `` tatars '' . 
  they 're tatars not tartars . 
  i know nobody likes the grammar-nazi , but many people are misspelling it on a consistent way all over reddit . 
  because saddam was literally hitler . 
  the region is just full of ambiguities . 
   how many of them are `` happy '' in this job ? 
  how many people are happy in minimum-wage jobs ? 
   if prostitution is just a job like any other , then why do n't we add it to the list of the state job finding agencies?you know , one of those where you get unemployment benefits , and when they find a job for you , you have to take it , or you lose your benefit . 
  for the same reason we do n't treat porn jobs that way . 
   to bust an illegal brothel is much faster and easier than to put into place all the checks to make sure it 's implementing all the laws regarding it . 
  yeah , and after the police busted the brothel , the prostitutes will get a normal , respectable job , right ? 
   instead , why do n't we simply adopt eu laws as mandated and do our reforms that way - for free ? 
  yeah , that 's nice , but ukraine is two weeks away from defaulting . 
  in hungary i do n't know about a place that has no drinkable tap water . 
  in the southern region it has `` iron '' taste tough ( but it 's still drinkable ) . 
   i do n't see where the contention is as long as you have no reason to believe it was gained illicitly . 
  the problem is that only one country gets the money , while the person enjoys the same benefits across the eu . 
  it also leads to a race to the bottom regarding the money-limit required , as it costs nothing for the issueing country . 
  high purity supercooled water freezes instantly when disturbed . 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpiuzi_3o8s http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/supercooling, 
  the point is the standard issue military weapon in russia ( and probably in ukraine too ) is no longer ak-47 but ak-74 . 
  on the livestream i have n't seen anything on the scale like it 's now . 
  and then they wonder why people are wearing helmets . 
   who the fuck gets offended by candy ?!, 
  what ? 
  voluntary kidnapping ? 
  i do n't think investors need child-support benefits that badly . 
   transforming our republic into the first galactic empire . 
  and it will be called reichtangela . 
  and who will produce the cheap crap then ? 
  china has always manipulated its currency to support their high volume of export . 
  i do n't see that policy going away . 
  there are also woman only chess tournaments , while woman can enter any tournament that men can . 
  http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/profit  2 , the monetary surplus left to a producer or employer after deducting wages , rent , cost of raw materials . 
  if you do n't plan to make profit you 'll go bankrupt in the long run because you wo n't have emergency savings . 
  also , if you ca n't make a profit there 's no reason to invest , as you could make more money keeping your money in the bank . 
   so that even if it starts to become loss making you must subsidize it because you ca n't let a power company fail , right ? 
  in the current setup they were already subsidized . 
  they had guaranteed 8 % profit . 
   this would not mean that people can not earn a living with providing these necessities , ... 
  i do n't think you know what the what the word `` profit '' means . 
  foreign investment is welcome in the sectors where market forces actually work . 
  americans call neocon what we call neoliberal . 
  it 's just a terminology difference . 
  same with socialism vs social-democracy . 
  [ do n't pretend poland , you 're using iso 8601 as well ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iso_8601#usage ), 
  will talking make petrol cheaper ? 
  many jews took german surnames in the habsburg monarchy . 
  they might have mixed with hungarians , romanians , serbians and not having a german heritage . 
  a salmiak based candy called `` dianas cukor '' is quite popular in hungary and i have n't heard anybody disliking it , but probably it 's not as concentrated and more sweet . 
  in hungary a similar salmiak based candy is quite popular as `` dian\u00e1s cukor '' , but it 's not a hard candy but one filled with alcoholic liquid . 
  salmiak is called `` szalmi\u00e1kszesz '' or `` s\u00f3sborszesz '' in hungarian and is strongly associated with the `` diana '' brand . 
  funny thing is , it was the socialist party ( mszp ) that closed down a major mental health institution in hungary ( opni ) .
