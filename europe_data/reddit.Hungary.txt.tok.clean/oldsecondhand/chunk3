  fidesz shares their lack of compassion , but opni became kind of a symbolic issue , so the current government tries to reopen it . 
  east germany is depopulating , as the jobs are in the west . 
  east germany has both a lower fertility rate , and lower proportion of young people as west germany . 
  crime might not be as bad as in detriot , but the depopulation and the lack of jobs is similar . 
  is this good enough ? 
  and also because the usd is more accepted around the world than the eur so you can print yourself out of a crisis . 
  turkey is a bad example , they ban wearing even headscarfes in government buildings . 
  they banned the fez too . 
  will daycare centers provide you privacy , if that 's where you register ? 
  i prefer normal blogs . 
  actually many hungarian politicians use blogs , much fewer use twitter . 
   when the eu funds , for example , a new bridge in romania , there are clauses that specify that equipment must be bought from european companies , the maintenance contracts must also be given to europeans etc. 
  that can mean romanian companies too , since they 're in the eu . 
  does israel have to buy from european companies ? 
  it would be much stronger restriction than in case of romania . 
   is the turquoise land that touches russia supposed to be hungary ? 
  no , it 's the greyish one north-west from the balkanic country ( which is the european part of the ottoman empire ) . 
  the problem is that hungary was represented as a sovereign state ( it was n't since 1526 ) , but it went from the ottomans directly to the habsburgs . 
  well , they could n't get the habsburg monarchy right either , and it had existed for far longer . 
  the thing is , eu agencies storing the metadata was not a secret , it 's been a law for almost 10 years . 
  the more worrying part is reading the content of e-mails . 
   well , i am against xenophobia and generalisations , but i would never go as far as to extend the blame to society . 
  i think it was sarcasm . 
  flair up !, 
  yep . 
  we had [ communism-light ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/goulash_communism ) . 
  but only after [ 1956 . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_revolution_of_1956 ) hungary was also the place where the iron curtain first fell . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/b%c3%a9la_kun#later_career  one bitter repercussion was the association of hungary 's jews with the suffering inflicted by the communists ; since kun and most of his colleagues were clearly jewish , [ 15 ] many hungarians recognized a jewish element in the bolshevist conspiracy afoot in central europe . 
  of course a lot of jewish property was also nationalized by the various communist governments , and they also suffered from the general discrimination against religious people . 
  well , it 's mix of traditional 19th century antisemitism , a chip on the shoulder because of m\u00e1ty\u00e1s r\u00e1kosi and b\u00e9la kun , and an overdose of ' 30-ies nostalgia . 
  i 've seen this a lot on spar store-brand products . 
   horthy the guy responsible for those roma , jewish , slovakian , romanian deaths during the war , is getting statues erected in his honor and is respected by the right , orban included . 
  horthy deported the jewish refugees that came here from germany , but he defended the jews with hungarian citizenship as long as he was in power . 
   there are a of romanians who remember the 1940s , and not very fondly . 
  there is a strong victim mentality on both sides . 
  yeah , but messing with hungarians ( and germans ) was government policy too . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bene%c5%a1_decrees http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czechoslovak-hungarian_population_exchange, 
  in handwriting it 's written with straight dashes . 
  but as gerusz said , it would make certain letters do big too look good in print . 
  showing them who is the boss . 
  because more immigrants speak english than german . 
  also uk had historically more lenient immigration policy . 
  i say we go back to communism because it works with the current people . 
  please tell , where can we get better people ? 
  there was low crime , no homelessness , no drug problems , no unemployment . 
  but it was propped up by foreign loans , the system could n't sustain itself economically , that 's why it crumbled . 
  hungary is a republic too , there 's still a crown in the coat of arms . 
  that 's the joke . 
  it 's worthless frozen land . 
  it was n't a colony , it was part of kingdom of hungary . 
  felvid\u00e9k was just a geographical term anyway . 
  are you sure it 's not r/spacedicks ? 
  yeah , and we 've seen how safe these applets are ... https://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/oracle-rushes-emergency-java-update-patch-mcrat-vulnerabilities-030413, 
  on the other hand gmail does n't let you include . exe files , even in compressed archives . 
  is n't it strange ? 
  i think it would be simpler to make it a loan , and if you stay you can write off - let 's say - 40 % of the payment from your personal income tax . 
  that way going abroad and coming back could be handled more flexibly , not with this all or nothing scheme . 
  on the other hand , hungary pays less into the eu budget than it gets back : most of the university renovations are done with eu grant money . 
  the grammar is pretty similar actually e.g. 
  tenses , passive speech , fixed word order . 
  is ( i kid you not ) used as an interjection such as `` really ? '', 
  i 'm not sure what you mean here , but if it 's `` bazdmeg '' then it would be translated to `` fuck that '' . 
   you spell it as you speak it , and you speak it as you spell it . 
  ( take that , french , german , english , ... ) mostly true . 
  one exception is `` ly '' vs `` j '' . 
  they sound exactly the same , and if you fuck that up , it means you 're `` uneducated '' . 
  fortunately there are not that many words with `` ly '' , around 20 that 's commonly used . 
  how do rich people get rich anyway ? 
  either they did something dirty or they inherited it . 
  after the fall of communism former factory and land owners all got a compensation . 
  they did the same with the church except the church opted for giving away many of its buildings to state schools in exchange for a regular monetary compensation . 
  at least that how it happened in hungary . 
   in the case of my brother , it 's over-tipping that they have to put up with . 
  / r/firstworldproblems, 
  he already filtered out `` shirt '' . 
   under the previous rules , parliament 's legal committees would assess the requests and issue a non-binding approval or rejection before a mandatory vote in the chamber . 
   with the changes approved on tuesday , parliament would not need to vote if the committees reject the requests from prosecutors . 
  i think the law is similar in hungary as well . 
  you described 99 % of country specific subreddits . 
  it does n't mean anything else besides german . 
  wikipedia says it 's of slavic origin : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/n%c3%a9met `` but another theory states that rather these words are derived from the name of the nemetes tribe , [ 28 ] [ 29 ] which is derived from the celtic root nemeto - . 
  [ 30 ] [ 31 ] '' http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavic_peoples#ethnonym, 
  in hungarian we have the word `` sv\u00e1b '' too , but it only refers to german minorities living in hungary . 
  we call the germans `` n\u00e9met '' . 
  and they have much more casualties than the us army and have no chance to overthrow the us government . 
  automatic weapons are banned , semi-automatics are allowed . 
   and that gypsies sent their children on the street to beg this thing actually exists . 
  you must have had a very sheltered life . 
  you can only get a black flag if you 're dead . 
  then you must be an untrustworthy double agent . 
  if they had smartphone with gps , they would n't have missed the continent in the first place . 
  stupid people are n't exclusive to reddit . 
  finnish suicide rates combined with arabic bombs ... 
  they 're also big in f2p : world of tanks , world of airplanes . 
  they just ca n't make game with the same amount of polish ( pun intended ) . 
  it 's not groundbreaking , but it looks like a decent game , it 's not just hot air . 
  bring them back to turkey ? 
   he also only expected about 500-1000 people . 
  that 's a really stupid excuse .
